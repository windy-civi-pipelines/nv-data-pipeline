Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law: (1) authorizes a board of county commissioners, with certain
2 exceptions, to exercise all powers necessary or proper to address matters of local
3 concern for the effective operation of a county government, whether or not the
4 powers are expressly granted to the board; and (2) defines “matter of local concern”
5 for such purposes. (NRS 244.143, 244.146) Existing law also authorizes a board of
6 county commissioners to enact and enforce local police and sanitary ordinances and
7 regulations that are not in conflict with the general laws and regulations of this
8 State. (NRS 244.357) Section 6 of this bill requires a board of county
9 commissioners in a county whose population is 700,000 or more (currently only
10 Clark County) to adopt an ordinance that designates the geographic boundaries of
11 one or more corridors in which the commission of crime poses a significant risk to
12 public safety and the economic welfare of this State due to the high concentration
13 of tourists, visitors, employees and other persons in such corridors. Section 6
14 provides that a person who is charged with, convicted of or the subject of deferred
15 adjudication for any offense punishable as a misdemeanor: (1) for a first offense
16 within the corridor within 2 years, may as a condition of release, sentencing,
-

17 suspension of sentence or deferred adjudication, as applicable, be prohibited from
18 entering the corridor in which the offense occurred for a period of not more than 1
19 year; and (2) for a second or subsequent offense within the corridor within 2 years,
20 must as a condition of release, sentencing, suspension of sentence or deferred
21 adjudication, as applicable, be prohibited from entering the corridor in which the
22 offense occurred for a period of not less than 1 year.
23 Section 2 of this bill authorizes a justice court, in a county wherein the board of
24 county commissioners adopts an ordinance designating the geographic boundaries
25 of one or more corridors pursuant to section 6, to establish an appropriate program
26 for the adjudication of offenses punishable as a misdemeanor that occurred within
27 the boundaries of such corridors.
28 Section 3 of this bill requires a justice court whose jurisdiction includes a
29 corridor established pursuant to section 6 to prepare and submit: (1) to the
30 Legislature an annual report containing certain information regarding crimes that
31 occur within such corridors; and (2) to the respective board of county
32 commissioners a monthly report containing certain information regarding crimes
33 that occur within such corridors.
34 Existing law provides that if a person commits an assault upon an officer who
35 is performing his or her duty and the person knew or should have known that the
36 victim was an officer, the person is guilty of: (1) a category B felony if the assault
37 is made with the use of a deadly weapon or the present ability to use a deadly
38 weapon; (2) a category D felony if the person is a probationer, prisoner or parolee;
39 or (3) if neither of those circumstances is present, a gross misdemeanor. (NRS
40 200.471) Additionally, existing law provides that if a person commits a battery
41 upon an officer and the person knew or should have known that the victim was an
42 officer, the person is guilty of: (1) a category B felony if the battery causes
43 substantial bodily harm or is committed by strangulation; or (2) if those
44 circumstances are not present and no greater penalty is provided by law, a gross
45 misdemeanor. (NRS 200.481) Sections 4 and 5 of this bill apply the enhanced
46 penalties to an assault or battery committed against a hospitality employee.

Jail or Detention Facility.
Effect on the State: Yes.
CONTAINS UNFUNDED MANDATE (§ 4)
(NOT REQUESTED BY AFFECTED LOCAL GOVERNMENT)
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public safety; establishing provisions relating to
the creation of corridors and the adjudication and
reporting of certain offenses committed within such
corridors; revising provisions relating to assault and
battery; providing penalties; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law: (1) authorizes a board of county commissioners, with certain
2 exceptions, to exercise all powers necessary or proper to address matters of local
3 concern for the effective operation of a county government, whether or not the
4 powers are expressly granted to the board; and (2) defines “matter of local concern”
5 for such purposes. (NRS 244.143, 244.146) Existing law also authorizes a board of
6 county commissioners to enact and enforce local police and sanitary ordinances and
7 regulations that are not in conflict with the general laws and regulations of this
8 State. (NRS 244.357) Section 6 of this bill requires a board of county
9 commissioners in a county whose population is 700,000 or more (currently only
10 Clark County) to adopt an ordinance that designates the geographic boundaries of
11 one or more corridors in which the commission of crime poses a significant risk to
12 public safety and the economic welfare of this State due to the high concentration
13 of tourists, visitors, employees and other persons in such corridors. Section 6
14 provides that a person who is charged with, convicted of or the subject of deferred
15 adjudication for any offense punishable as a misdemeanor: (1) for a first offense
16 within the corridor within 2 years, may as a condition of release, sentencing,
-

– 2 –
17 suspension of sentence or deferred adjudication, as applicable, be prohibited from
18 entering the corridor in which the offense occurred for a period of not more than 1
19 year; and (2) for a second or subsequent offense within the corridor within 2 years,
20 must as a condition of release, sentencing, suspension of sentence or deferred
21 adjudication, as applicable, be prohibited from entering the corridor in which the
22 offense occurred for a period of not less than 1 year.
23 Section 2 of this bill authorizes a justice court, in a county wherein the board of
24 county commissioners adopts an ordinance designating the geographic boundaries
25 of one or more corridors pursuant to section 6, to establish an appropriate program
26 for the adjudication of offenses punishable as a misdemeanor that occurred within
27 the boundaries of such corridors.
28 Section 3 of this bill requires a justice court whose jurisdiction includes a
29 corridor established pursuant to section 6 to prepare and submit: (1) to the
30 Legislature an annual report containing certain information regarding crimes that
31 occur within such corridors; and (2) to the respective board of county
32 commissioners a monthly report containing certain information regarding crimes
33 that occur within such corridors.
34 Existing law provides that if a person commits an assault upon an officer who
35 is performing his or her duty and the person knew or should have known that the
36 victim was an officer, the person is guilty of: (1) a category B felony if the assault
37 is made with the use of a deadly weapon or the present ability to use a deadly
38 weapon; (2) a category D felony if the person is a probationer, prisoner or parolee;
39 or (3) if neither of those circumstances is present, a gross misdemeanor. (NRS
40 200.471) Additionally, existing law provides that if a person commits a battery
41 upon an officer and the person knew or should have known that the victim was an
42 officer, the person is guilty of: (1) a category B felony if the battery causes
43 substantial bodily harm or is committed by strangulation; or (2) if those
44 circumstances are not present and no greater penalty is provided by law, a gross
45 misdemeanor. (NRS 200.481) Sections 4 and 5 of this bill apply the enhanced
46 penalties to an assault or battery committed against a hospitality employee.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

8 misdemeanor that occurred within such corridors.
9 2. Under a program established pursuant to subsection 1, a
