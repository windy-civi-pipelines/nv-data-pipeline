Section 1:
on Jobs and Economy
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to employment; revising provisions relating to the
compensation of employees; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law establishes requirements relating to compensation, wages and
hours of employees. (Chapter 608 of NRS) Existing state law requires, with certain
exceptions that are similar to certain exceptions found in federal law and
regulations relating to the federal Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, an employer to
pay compensation to an employee for each hour the employee works. (NRS

Section 2:
608.016, 608.0195, 608.215; 29 U.S.C. § 213; 29 C.F.R. §§ 552.102, 785.22) The
federal Portal-to-Portal Act of 1947 provides that certain activities are not
compensable under the federal Fair Labor Standards Act, including those which are
preliminary to or postliminary to the principal activity or activities which the
employee is engaged to perform. (29 U.S.C. §§ 252, 254) In 2025, the Nevada
Supreme Court held that the Nevada Legislature has not incorporated those
additional exceptions from the federal Portal-to-Portal Act into state law.
(Amazon.com Servs., LLC v. Malloy, 141 Nev. Adv. Op. 50, 2025 WL 3032215
(2025)) Section 1 of this bill adds to state law certain additional exclusions and
exceptions relating to compensable activities and working time from the federal
Portal-to-Portal Act and federal Fair Labor Standards Act including: (1) relief from
certain claims, liability and punishment under federal law; (2) waiting time; (3)
preparatory and concluding activities; (4) lectures, meetings and training
programs; and (5) travel time. (29 U.S.C. §§ 252, 254; 29 C.F.R. §§ 785.14-785.17,

Section 3:
785.26-785.41) Section 5 of this bill provides that the amendatory provisions of

Section 4:
section 1 expire by limitation on October 31, 2029.
Existing law requires, with certain exceptions, that employees be paid overtime
for certain hours. (NRS 608.018) Section 2 of this bill makes certain calculations
relating to overtime subject to federal regulations which relate to principles for
computing overtime based on the regular rate of pay under the Fair Labor Standards
Act. (29 C.F.R. §§ 778.107-778.503)
