EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to employment; revising provisions relating to the
compensation of employees; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes requirements relating to compensation, wages and
2 hours of employees. (Chapter 608 of NRS) Existing state law requires, with certain
3 exceptions that are similar to certain exceptions found in federal law and
4 regulations relating to the federal Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, an employer to
5 pay compensation to an employee for each hour the employee works. (NRS
6 608.016, 608.0195, 608.215; 29 U.S.C. § 213; 29 C.F.R. §§ 552.102, 785.22) The
7 federal Portal-to-Portal Act of 1947 provides that certain activities are not
8 compensable under the federal Fair Labor Standards Act, including those which are
9 preliminary to or postliminary to the principal activity or activities which the
10 employee is engaged to perform. (29 U.S.C. §§ 252, 254) In 2025, the Nevada
11 Supreme Court held that the Nevada Legislature has not incorporated those
12 additional exceptions from the federal Portal-to-Portal Act into state law.
13 (Amazon.com Servs., LLC v. Malloy, 141 Nev. Adv. Op. 50, 2025 WL 3032215
14 (2025)) Section 1 of this bill adds to state law certain additional exclusions and
15 exceptions relating to compensable activities and working time from the federal
16 Portal-to-Portal Act and federal Fair Labor Standards Act including: (1) relief from
17 certain claims, liability and punishment under federal law; (2) waiting time; (3)
18 preparatory and concluding activities; (4) lectures, meetings and training
19 programs; and (5) travel time. (29 U.S.C. §§ 252, 254; 29 C.F.R. §§ 785.14-785.17,
20 785.26-785.41)
21 Existing law requires, with certain exceptions, that employees be paid overtime
22 for certain hours. (NRS 608.018) Section 2 of this bill makes certain calculations
23 relating to overtime subject to federal regulations which relate to principles for
24 computing overtime based on the regular rate of pay under the Fair Labor Standards
25 Act. (29 C.F.R. §§ 778.107-778.503)
