EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public safety; revising provisions governing
regulation and designation of school zones and school
crossing zones; revising provisions relating to signs in
school zones and school crossing zones; providing for
enhanced penalties for certain traffic violations in active
school zones and school crossing zones; providing
penalties; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the governing body of a local government or the
2 Department of Transportation to designate school zones and school crossing zones.
3 In relevant part, existing law does not prohibit a person from driving at certain
4 speeds, making a U-turn or overtaking and passing another vehicle in a school zone
5 or school crossing zone, as applicable, during the period from a half hour after
6 school is no longer in operation to a half hour before school is next in operation.
7 (NRS 484B.363) Section 24 of this bill revises this provision to require the
8 governing body or the Department which designated the school zone or school
9 crossing zone, as applicable, to specify one or more periods in which a person is not
10 prohibited from performing these acts in a school zone or school crossing zone.
11 However, section 24 provides that any such period may not encompass the 30
12 minutes after school is no longer in operation or the 30 minutes before school is
13 next in operation.

14 Existing law establishes certain requirements related to signs and other devices
15 designating school zones and school crossing zones. (NRS 268.425, 269.185,
16 484B.363, 484B.367) Section 25 of this bill requires the governing body or the
17 Department which designated the school zone or school crossing zone, as
18 applicable, to prescribe standards for the design, application, installation and
19 maintenance of signs and other devices designating the conditions that apply to
20 school zones and school crossing zones. Section 25 also authorizes the governing
21 body and the Department to consult and collaborate with certain officers and
22 entities regarding the standards. Sections 35 and 36 of this bill make conforming
23 changes related to the standards applicable to the signs and other devices in school
24 zones and school crossing zones.
25 Existing law provides that a person who commits certain traffic violations in a
26 work zone or a pedestrian safety zone may be subject to double the penalty for the
27 underlying offense or infraction, subject to certain limitations. (NRS 484B.130,
28 484B.135) Section 2 of this bill similarly provides that a person who commits
29 certain traffic violations in an active school zone or active school crossing zone
30 may be subject to double the penalty for the underlying offense or infraction,
31 subject to certain limitations. Section 2 also provides that a person who commits
32 such traffic violations in an active school zone or active school crossing zone is
33 subject to an assessment of twice the number of demerit points assigned to the
34 underlying offense. Sections 1, 3-23 and 26-34 of this bill make conforming
35 changes related to the enhanced penalty prescribed by section 2.

37 alone or in combination with another signal:
38 (a) Vehicular traffic facing the signal is permitted to cautiously
39 enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by the
40 arrow signal, or other such movement as is permitted by other signal
41 indications displayed at the same time. Such vehicular traffic must
42 yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection
43 or an adjacent crosswalk and yield the right-of-way to other traffic
44 lawfully within the intersection.
-
*AB6*
– 18 –
1 (b) Pedestrians facing such a signal, unless otherwise directed
2 by another device as provided in NRS 484B.283, are thereby

5 unmarked crosswalk.
6 8. Where the signal is a steady red signal alone:
7 (a) Vehicular traffic facing the signal must stop before entering
8 the crosswalk on the nearest side of the intersection where the sign
9 or pavement marking indicates where the stop must be made, or in
10 the absence of any such crosswalk, sign or marking, then before
11 entering the intersection, and, except as otherwise provided in
12 paragraphs (c) and (d), must remain stopped or standing until the
13 green signal is shown.
14 (b) Pedestrians facing such a signal shall not enter the highway,
15 unless permitted to proceed by another device as provided in
16 NRS 484B.283.
17 (c) After complying with the requirement to stop, vehicular
18 traffic facing such a signal and situated on the extreme right of the

20 when the intersecting highway is two-directional or one-way to the
21 right, or vehicular traffic facing such a signal and situated on
22 the extreme left of a one-way highway may proceed into the
23 intersection for a left turn only when the intersecting highway is
24 one-way to the left, but must yield the right-of-way to pedestrians
25 and other traffic proceeding as directed by the signal at the
26 intersection.
27 (d) After complying with the requirement to stop, a person
28 driving a motorcycle, moped or trimobile or riding a bicycle, an
29 electric bicycle or an electric scooter may proceed straight through
30 or turn right or left if:
31 (1) The person waits for two complete cycles of the lights or
32 lighted arrows of the applicable official traffic-control device and
33 the signal does not change because of a malfunction or because the
34 signal failed to detect the presence of the motorcycle, moped,
35 trimobile, bicycle, electric bicycle or electric scooter;
36 (2) No other device at the place prohibits either or both such
37 turns, if applicable; and
38 (3) The person yields the right-of-way to pedestrians and
39 other traffic proceeding as directed by the signal at the intersection.
40 (e) Vehicular traffic facing the signal may not proceed on or
41 through any private or public property to enter the intersecting street
42 where traffic is not facing a red signal to avoid the red signal.
43 9. Where the signal is a steady red with a green turn arrow:
44 (a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b), vehicular
45 traffic facing the signal may enter the intersection only to make the
-
*AB6*
– 19 –
1 movement indicated by the green turn arrow, but must yield the
2 right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk
3 and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection. Drivers turning in
4 the direction of the arrow are thereby advised that so long as the turn
5 arrow is illuminated, oncoming or opposing traffic simultaneously
6 faces a steady red signal.
7 (b) A person driving a motorcycle, moped or trimobile or riding
8 a bicycle, an electric bicycle or an electric scooter facing the signal
9 may proceed straight through or turn in the direction opposite that
10 indicated by the green turn arrow if:
11 (1) The person stops before entering the crosswalk on the
12 nearest side of the intersection where the sign or pavement marking
13 indicates where the stop must be made or, in the absence of any
14 such crosswalk, sign or marking, before entering the intersection;
15 (2) The person waits for two complete cycles of the lights or
16 lighted arrows of the applicable official traffic-control device and
17 the signal does not change because of a malfunction or because the
18 signal failed to detect the presence of the motorcycle, moped,
19 trimobile, bicycle, electric bicycle or electric scooter;
20 (3) No other device at the place prohibits the turn, if
21 applicable; and
22 (4) The person yields the right-of-way to pedestrians
23 lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully
24 using the intersection.
25 (c) Pedestrians facing such a signal shall not enter the highway,
26 unless permitted to proceed by another device as provided in
27 NRS 484B.283.
28 10. If a person violates paragraph (d) of subsection 8 or
29 paragraph (b) of subsection 9 and that violation results in an injury
30 to another person, the violation creates a rebuttable presumption of
31 all facts necessary to impose civil liability for the injury.
32 11. If a signal is erected and maintained at a place other than an
33 intersection, the provisions of this section are applicable except as to
34 those provisions which by their nature can have no application. Any
35 stop required must be made at a sign or pavement marking
36 indicating where the stop must be made, but in the absence of any
37 such device the stop must be made at the signal.
38 12. Whenever signals are placed over the individual lanes of a
39 highway, the signals indicate, and apply to drivers of vehicles, as

42 the signal may drive in any lane over which the green signal is
43 shown.
44 (b) A red “X” symbol means a driver facing the signal must not
45 enter or drive in any lane over which the red signal is shown.

2 or take any other action that prohibits vehicular traffic from crossing
3 an intersection when:
4 (a) The red signal is exhibited; and
5 (b) The vehicular traffic in question had already completely
6 entered the intersection before the red signal was exhibited. For the
7 purposes of this paragraph, a vehicle shall be considered to have
8 “completely entered” an intersection when all portions of the vehicle
9 have crossed the limit line or other point of demarcation behind
10 which vehicular traffic must stop when a red signal is displayed.

A.B. 6
ASSEMBLY BILL NO. 6–SELECT COMMITTEE
ON PUBLIC SAFETY AND SECURITY
PREFILED NOVEMBER 12, 2025
____________
Referred to Select Committee on Public Safety and Security
SUMMARY—Revises provisions governing traffic laws.
(BDR 43-23)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: Increases or Newly
Provides for Term of Imprisonment in County or City
Jail or Detention Facility.
Effect on the State: Yes.
CONTAINS UNFUNDED MANDATE (§§ 24, 25, 35, 36)
(NOT REQUESTED BY AFFECTED LOCAL GOVERNMENT)
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public safety; revising provisions governing
regulation and designation of school zones and school
crossing zones; revising provisions relating to signs in
school zones and school crossing zones; providing for
enhanced penalties for certain traffic violations in active
school zones and school crossing zones; providing
penalties; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the governing body of a local government or the
2 Department of Transportation to designate school zones and school crossing zones.
3 In relevant part, existing law does not prohibit a person from driving at certain
4 speeds, making a U-turn or overtaking and passing another vehicle in a school zone
5 or school crossing zone, as applicable, during the period from a half hour after
6 school is no longer in operation to a half hour before school is next in operation.
7 (NRS 484B.363) Section 24 of this bill revises this provision to require the
8 governing body or the Department which designated the school zone or school
9 crossing zone, as applicable, to specify one or more periods in which a person is not
10 prohibited from performing these acts in a school zone or school crossing zone.
11 However, section 24 provides that any such period may not encompass the 30
12 minutes after school is no longer in operation or the 30 minutes before school is
13 next in operation.

*AB6*

– 2 –
14 Existing law establishes certain requirements related to signs and other devices
15 designating school zones and school crossing zones. (NRS 268.425, 269.185,
16 484B.363, 484B.367) Section 25 of this bill requires the governing body or the
17 Department which designated the school zone or school crossing zone, as
18 applicable, to prescribe standards for the design, application, installation and
19 maintenance of signs and other devices designating the conditions that apply to
20 school zones and school crossing zones. Section 25 also authorizes the governing
21 body and the Department to consult and collaborate with certain officers and
22 entities regarding the standards. Sections 35 and 36 of this bill make conforming
23 changes related to the standards applicable to the signs and other devices in school
24 zones and school crossing zones.
25 Existing law provides that a person who commits certain traffic violations in a
26 work zone or a pedestrian safety zone may be subject to double the penalty for the
27 underlying offense or infraction, subject to certain limitations. (NRS 484B.130,
28 484B.135) Section 2 of this bill similarly provides that a person who commits
29 certain traffic violations in an active school zone or active school crossing zone
30 may be subject to double the penalty for the underlying offense or infraction,
31 subject to certain limitations. Section 2 also provides that a person who commits
32 such traffic violations in an active school zone or active school crossing zone is
33 subject to an assessment of twice the number of demerit points assigned to the
34 underlying offense. Sections 1, 3-23 and 26-34 of this bill make conforming
35 changes related to the enhanced penalty prescribed by section 2.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN

4 justice court or district court in this State or a finding by any
5 municipal court or justice court in this State that a person has
6 committed a civil infraction pursuant to NRS 484A.703 to
7 484A.705, inclusive. The term includes a finding by a juvenile court
8 that a child has violated a traffic law or ordinance other than one
9 governing standing or parking. The term does not include:
10 (a) A conviction or a finding by a juvenile court of a violation of

14 infraction detection system pursuant to NRS 484A.605.
15 2. [The] Subject to section 2 of this act, the Department shall
16 establish a uniform system of demerit points for various traffic
17 violations occurring within this State affecting the driving privilege
18 of any person who holds a driver’s license issued by the Department

20 NRS 483.447. The system must be based on the accumulation of
21 demerits during a period of 12 months.
-

1 3. The system must be uniform in its operation, and the
2 Department shall set up a schedule of demerits for each traffic
3 violation, depending upon the gravity of the violation, on a scale of
4 one demerit point for a minor violation of any traffic law to eight
5 demerit points for an extremely serious violation of the law
6 governing traffic violations. If a conviction of two or more traffic
7 violations committed on a single occasion is obtained, points must
8 be assessed for one offense or civil infraction, and if the point values
9 differ, points must be assessed for the offense or civil infraction
10 having the greater point value. Details of the violation must be
11 submitted to the Department by the court where the conviction or
12 finding is obtained. The Department may provide for a graduated
13 system of demerits within each category of violations according to
14 the extent to which the traffic law was violated.

24 484C.110 or 484C.120, that occurred in an active school zone or
25 an active school crossing zone may:
26 (a) If the violation is a criminal offense, be punished by
