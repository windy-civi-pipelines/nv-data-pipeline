Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the governing body of a local government or the Department of
2 Transportation to designate school zones and school crossing zones. In relevant part, existing
3 law does not prohibit a person from driving at certain speeds, making a U-turn or overtaking
4 and passing another vehicle in a school zone or school crossing zone, as applicable, during the
5 period from a half hour after school is no longer in operation to a half hour before school is
6 next in operation. (NRS 484B.363) Section 24 of this bill revises this provision to require the
7 governing body or the Department which designated the school zone or school crossing zone,
8 as applicable, to specify one or more periods in which a person is not prohibited from
9 performing these acts in a school zone or school crossing zone. However, section 24 provides
10 that any such period may not encompass the 30 minutes after school is no longer in operation
11 or the 30 minutes before school is next in operation.
12 Existing law establishes certain requirements related to signs and other devices
13 designating school zones and school crossing zones. (NRS 268.425, 269.185, 484B.363,
Senate Amendment No. 29 to Assembly Bill No. 6 First Reprint Page 4
14 484B.367) Section 25 of this bill requires the governing body or the Department which
15 designated the school zone or school crossing zone, as applicable, to: (1) place signs in certain
16 locations indicating the presence of a school zone or school crossing zone; and (2) prescribe
17 standards for the design, application, installation and maintenance of the signs designating the
18 conditions that apply to school zones and school crossing zones. Section 25 also authorizes
19 the governing body and the Department to consult and collaborate with certain officers and
20 entities regarding the standards. Sections 35 and 36 of this bill make conforming changes
21 related to the standards applicable to the signs and other devices in school zones and school
22 crossing zones.
23 Existing law provides that a person who commits certain traffic violations in a work zone
24 or a pedestrian safety zone may be subject to double the penalty for the underlying offense or
25 infraction, subject to certain limitations. (NRS 484B.130, 484B.135) Section 2 of this bill
26 similarly provides that a person who commits certain traffic violations in an active school
27 zone or active school crossing zone may be subject to double the penalty for the underlying
28 offense or infraction, subject to certain limitations. Section 2 also provides that a person who
29 commits such traffic violations in an active school zone or active school crossing zone is
30 subject to an assessment of twice the number of demerit points assigned to the underlying
31 offense. Sections 1, 3-23 and 26-34 of this bill make conforming changes related to the
32 enhanced penalty prescribed by section 2.
33 Existing law sets forth certain requirements governing the privacy of data concerning
34 pupils. (NRS 388.267-388.296) Section 36.3 of this bill prohibits a public school from
35 including certain information concerning a pupil in a directory of pupils maintained by the
36 school. Section 36.4 of this bill prohibits a school district or public school from disclosing the
37 [personally identifiable information] phone number or address of any pupil or parent or
38 legal guardian of a pupil unless required in certain circumstances. [Section 36.4 additionally:
39 (1) authorizes a third party to request information contained in a directory pursuant to section
40 36.3; and (2) sets forth the method for submitting such a request. Section 36.4 additionally
41 authorizes a pupil who is at least 18 years of age or the parent or legal guardian of a pupil who
42 is less than 18 years of age to reject the provision of such information concerning the pupil.
43 Furthermore, section 36.4 requires the compilation of lists containing certain information
44 about requests for information concerning pupils submitted pursuant to section 36.4.]

16 NRS, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer.
17 2. No provision of chapters 484A to 484E, inclusive, of NRS for which such
18 devices are required may be enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and
19 place of the alleged violation the device is not in proper position and sufficiently
20 legible to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. Whenever a particular
21 provision of chapters 484A to 484E, inclusive, of NRS does not state that such
22 devices are required, the provision is effective even though no devices are erected
23 or in place.
24 3. Whenever devices are placed in position approximately conforming to the
25 requirements of chapters 484A to 484E, inclusive, of NRS, such devices are
26 presumed to have been so placed by the official act or direction of a public
27 authority, unless the contrary is established by competent evidence.
28 4. Any device placed pursuant to the provisions of chapters 484A to 484E,

45 one at a time or in combination as declared in the manual and specifications
46 adopted by the Department of Transportation, only the colors green, yellow and red
47 may be used, except for special pedestrian-control devices carrying a word legend
48 as provided in NRS 484B.283. The lights, arrows and combinations thereof indicate
49 and apply to drivers of vehicles and pedestrians as provided in this section.
50 2. When the signal is circular green alone:
51 (a) Vehicular traffic facing the signal may proceed straight through or turn
52 right or left unless another device at the place prohibits either or both such turns.
53 Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left, must yield the right-
Senate Amendment No. 29 to Assembly Bill No. 6 First Reprint Page 15
1 of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an
2 adjacent crosswalk at the time the signal is exhibited.
3 (b) Pedestrians facing such a signal may proceed across the highway within
4 any marked or unmarked crosswalk, unless directed otherwise by another device as
5 provided in NRS 484B.283.

7 (a) Vehicular traffic facing the signal may proceed to make the movement
8 indicated by the green turn arrow or such other movement as is permitted by the
9 circular green signal, but the traffic must yield the right-of-way to pedestrians
10 lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the
11 intersection at the time the signal is exhibited. Drivers turning in the direction of the
12 arrow when displayed with the circular green are thereby advised that so long as a
13 turn arrow is illuminated, oncoming or opposing traffic simultaneously faces a
14 steady red signal.
15 (b) Pedestrians facing such a signal may proceed across the highway within
16 any marked or unmarked crosswalk, unless directed otherwise by another device as
17 provided in NRS 484B.283.

37 when the red signal is exhibited.
38 (b) Pedestrians facing such a signal, unless otherwise directed by another
39 device as provided in NRS 484B.283, are thereby advised that there is insufficient
40 time to cross the highway.
41 7. Where the signal is a flashing yellow turn arrow, displayed alone or in
42 combination with another signal:
43 (a) Vehicular traffic facing the signal is permitted to cautiously enter the
44 intersection only to make the movement indicated by the arrow signal, or other such
45 movement as is permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time.
46 Such vehicular traffic must yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within the
47 intersection or an adjacent crosswalk and yield the right-of-way to other traffic
48 lawfully within the intersection.
49 (b) Pedestrians facing such a signal, unless otherwise directed by another
50 device as provided in NRS 484B.283, are thereby advised that there may be
51 insufficient time to cross the highway, but may proceed across the highway within
52 the appropriate marked or unmarked crosswalk.
53 8. Where the signal is a steady red signal alone:
Senate Amendment No. 29 to Assembly Bill No. 6 First Reprint Page 16
1 (a) Vehicular traffic facing the signal must stop before entering the crosswalk
2 on the nearest side of the intersection where the sign or pavement marking indicates
3 where the stop must be made, or in the absence of any such crosswalk, sign or
4 marking, then before entering the intersection, and, except as otherwise provided in
5 paragraphs (c) and (d), must remain stopped or standing until the green signal is
6 shown.
7 (b) Pedestrians facing such a signal shall not enter the highway, unless
8 permitted to proceed by another device as provided in NRS 484B.283.
9 (c) After complying with the requirement to stop, vehicular traffic facing such
10 a signal and situated on the extreme right of the highway may proceed into the
11 intersection for a right turn only when the intersecting highway is two-directional or
12 one-way to the right, or vehicular traffic facing such a signal and situated on the
13 extreme left of a one-way highway may proceed into the intersection for a left turn
14 only when the intersecting highway is one-way to the left, but must yield the right-
15 of-way to pedestrians and other traffic proceeding as directed by the signal at the
16 intersection.
17 (d) After complying with the requirement to stop, a person driving a
18 motorcycle, moped or trimobile or riding a bicycle, an electric bicycle or an electric
19 scooter may proceed straight through or turn right or left if:
20 (1) The person waits for two complete cycles of the lights or lighted arrows
21 of the applicable official traffic-control device and the signal does not change
22 because of a malfunction or because the signal failed to detect the presence of the
23 motorcycle, moped, trimobile, bicycle, electric bicycle or electric scooter;
24 (2) No other device at the place prohibits either or both such turns, if
25 applicable; and
26 (3) The person yields the right-of-way to pedestrians and other traffic
27 proceeding as directed by the signal at the intersection.

32 (a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b), vehicular traffic facing the
33 signal may enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by the green
34 turn arrow, but must yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an
35 adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection. Drivers
36 turning in the direction of the arrow are thereby advised that so long as the turn
37 arrow is illuminated, oncoming or opposing traffic simultaneously faces a steady
38 red signal.
39 (b) A person driving a motorcycle, moped or trimobile or riding a bicycle, an
40 electric bicycle or an electric scooter facing the signal may proceed straight through
41 or turn in the direction opposite that indicated by the green turn arrow if:
42 (1) The person stops before entering the crosswalk on the nearest side of
43 the intersection where the sign or pavement marking indicates where the stop must
44 be made or, in the absence of any such crosswalk, sign or marking, before entering
45 the intersection;
46 (2) The person waits for two complete cycles of the lights or lighted arrows
47 of the applicable official traffic-control device and the signal does not change
48 because of a malfunction or because the signal failed to detect the presence of the
49 motorcycle, moped, trimobile, bicycle, electric bicycle or electric scooter;
50 (3) No other device at the place prohibits the turn, if applicable; and
51 (4) The person yields the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an
52 adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
Senate Amendment No. 29 to Assembly Bill No. 6 First Reprint Page 17

2 permitted to proceed by another device as provided in NRS 484B.283.
3 10. If a person violates paragraph (d) of subsection 8 or paragraph (b) of
4 subsection 9 and that violation results in an injury to another person, the violation
5 creates a rebuttable presumption of all facts necessary to impose civil liability for
6 the injury.
7 11. If a signal is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection,
8 the provisions of this section are applicable except as to those provisions which by
9 their nature can have no application. Any stop required must be made at a sign or
10 pavement marking indicating where the stop must be made, but in the absence of
11 any such device the stop must be made at the signal.
12 12. Whenever signals are placed over the individual lanes of a highway, the
13 signals indicate, and apply to drivers of vehicles, as follows:
14 (a) A downward-pointing green arrow means that a driver facing the signal
15 may drive in any lane over which the green signal is shown.

19 other action that prohibits vehicular traffic from crossing an intersection when:
20 (a) The red signal is exhibited; and
21 (b) The vehicular traffic in question had already completely entered the
22 intersection before the red signal was exhibited. For the purposes of this paragraph,
23 a vehicle shall be considered to have “completely entered” an intersection when all
24 portions of the vehicle have crossed the limit line or other point of demarcation
25 behind which vehicular traffic must stop when a red signal is displayed.
26 14. A person who violates any provision of this section may be subject to the
27 additional penalty set forth in NRS 484B.135 [.] or section 2 of this act.

33 2. A person who violates subsection 1:
34 (a) Is guilty of a misdemeanor; and

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public safety; revising provisions governing regulation and
designation of school zones and school crossing zones; revising
provisions relating to signs in school zones and school crossing zones;
providing for enhanced penalties for certain traffic violations in active
school zones and school crossing zones; prohibiting the inclusion of
certain information concerning pupils within a directory of pupils;
prohibiting the provision of certain information concerning pupils to
third parties; [setting forth the method for a third party to request
certain information concerning pupils; requiring the compilation of
lists containing certain information included in such requests for
information;] providing penalties; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the governing body of a local government or the Department of
2 Transportation to designate school zones and school crossing zones. In relevant part, existing
3 law does not prohibit a person from driving at certain speeds, making a U-turn or overtaking
4 and passing another vehicle in a school zone or school crossing zone, as applicable, during the
5 period from a half hour after school is no longer in operation to a half hour before school is
6 next in operation. (NRS 484B.363) Section 24 of this bill revises this provision to require the
7 governing body or the Department which designated the school zone or school crossing zone,
8 as applicable, to specify one or more periods in which a person is not prohibited from
9 performing these acts in a school zone or school crossing zone. However, section 24 provides
10 that any such period may not encompass the 30 minutes after school is no longer in operation
11 or the 30 minutes before school is next in operation.
12 Existing law establishes certain requirements related to signs and other devices
13 designating school zones and school crossing zones. (NRS 268.425, 269.185, 484B.363,

Senate Amendment No. 29 to Assembly Bill No. 6 First Reprint Page 4
14 484B.367) Section 25 of this bill requires the governing body or the Department which
15 designated the school zone or school crossing zone, as applicable, to: (1) place signs in certain
16 locations indicating the presence of a school zone or school crossing zone; and (2) prescribe
17 standards for the design, application, installation and maintenance of the signs designating the
18 conditions that apply to school zones and school crossing zones. Section 25 also authorizes
19 the governing body and the Department to consult and collaborate with certain officers and
20 entities regarding the standards. Sections 35 and 36 of this bill make conforming changes
21 related to the standards applicable to the signs and other devices in school zones and school
22 crossing zones.
23 Existing law provides that a person who commits certain traffic violations in a work zone
24 or a pedestrian safety zone may be subject to double the penalty for the underlying offense or
25 infraction, subject to certain limitations. (NRS 484B.130, 484B.135) Section 2 of this bill
26 similarly provides that a person who commits certain traffic violations in an active school
27 zone or active school crossing zone may be subject to double the penalty for the underlying
28 offense or infraction, subject to certain limitations. Section 2 also provides that a person who
29 commits such traffic violations in an active school zone or active school crossing zone is
30 subject to an assessment of twice the number of demerit points assigned to the underlying
31 offense. Sections 1, 3-23 and 26-34 of this bill make conforming changes related to the
32 enhanced penalty prescribed by section 2.
33 Existing law sets forth certain requirements governing the privacy of data concerning
34 pupils. (NRS 388.267-388.296) Section 36.3 of this bill prohibits a public school from
35 including certain information concerning a pupil in a directory of pupils maintained by the
36 school. Section 36.4 of this bill prohibits a school district or public school from disclosing the
37 [personally identifiable information] phone number or address of any pupil or parent or
38 legal guardian of a pupil unless required in certain circumstances. [Section 36.4 additionally:
39 (1) authorizes a third party to request information contained in a directory pursuant to section
40 36.3; and (2) sets forth the method for submitting such a request. Section 36.4 additionally
41 authorizes a pupil who is at least 18 years of age or the parent or legal guardian of a pupil who
42 is less than 18 years of age to reject the provision of such information concerning the pupil.
43 Furthermore, section 36.4 requires the compilation of lists containing certain information
44 about requests for information concerning pupils submitted pursuant to section 36.4.]

16 NRS, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer.
17 2. No provision of chapters 484A to 484E, inclusive, of NRS for which such
18 devices are required may be enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and
19 place of the alleged violation the device is not in proper position and sufficiently
20 legible to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. Whenever a particular
21 provision of chapters 484A to 484E, inclusive, of NRS does not state that such
22 devices are required, the provision is effective even though no devices are erected
23 or in place.
24 3. Whenever devices are placed in position approximately conforming to the

7 (a) Vehicular traffic facing the signal may proceed to make the movement
8 indicated by the green turn arrow or such other movement as is permitted by the
9 circular green signal, but the traffic must yield the right-of-way to pedestrians
10 lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the
11 intersection at the time the signal is exhibited. Drivers turning in the direction of the
12 arrow when displayed with the circular green are thereby advised that so long as a
13 turn arrow is illuminated, oncoming or opposing traffic simultaneously faces a
14 steady red signal.
15 (b) Pedestrians facing such a signal may proceed across the highway within
16 any marked or unmarked crosswalk, unless directed otherwise by another device as
17 provided in NRS 484B.283.

37 when the red signal is exhibited.
38 (b) Pedestrians facing such a signal, unless otherwise directed by another
39 device as provided in NRS 484B.283, are thereby advised that there is insufficient
40 time to cross the highway.
41 7. Where the signal is a flashing yellow turn arrow, displayed alone or in
42 combination with another signal:
43 (a) Vehicular traffic facing the signal is permitted to cautiously enter the
44 intersection only to make the movement indicated by the arrow signal, or other such
45 movement as is permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time.
46 Such vehicular traffic must yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within the
47 intersection or an adjacent crosswalk and yield the right-of-way to other traffic
48 lawfully within the intersection.
49 (b) Pedestrians facing such a signal, unless otherwise directed by another
50 device as provided in NRS 484B.283, are thereby advised that there may be
51 insufficient time to cross the highway, but may proceed across the highway within
52 the appropriate marked or unmarked crosswalk.

Senate Amendment No. 29 to Assembly Bill No. 6 First Reprint Page 16
1 (a) Vehicular traffic facing the signal must stop before entering the crosswalk
2 on the nearest side of the intersection where the sign or pavement marking indicates
3 where the stop must be made, or in the absence of any such crosswalk, sign or
4 marking, then before entering the intersection, and, except as otherwise provided in
5 paragraphs (c) and (d), must remain stopped or standing until the green signal is
6 shown.
7 (b) Pedestrians facing such a signal shall not enter the highway, unless
8 permitted to proceed by another device as provided in NRS 484B.283.
9 (c) After complying with the requirement to stop, vehicular traffic facing such
10 a signal and situated on the extreme right of the highway may proceed into the
11 intersection for a right turn only when the intersecting highway is two-directional or
12 one-way to the right, or vehicular traffic facing such a signal and situated on the
13 extreme left of a one-way highway may proceed into the intersection for a left turn
14 only when the intersecting highway is one-way to the left, but must yield the right-
15 of-way to pedestrians and other traffic proceeding as directed by the signal at the
16 intersection.
17 (d) After complying with the requirement to stop, a person driving a
18 motorcycle, moped or trimobile or riding a bicycle, an electric bicycle or an electric
19 scooter may proceed straight through or turn right or left if:
20 (1) The person waits for two complete cycles of the lights or lighted arrows
21 of the applicable official traffic-control device and the signal does not change
22 because of a malfunction or because the signal failed to detect the presence of the
23 motorcycle, moped, trimobile, bicycle, electric bicycle or electric scooter;
24 (2) No other device at the place prohibits either or both such turns, if
25 applicable; and
26 (3) The person yields the right-of-way to pedestrians and other traffic
27 proceeding as directed by the signal at the intersection.

32 (a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b), vehicular traffic facing the
33 signal may enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by the green
34 turn arrow, but must yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an
35 adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection. Drivers
36 turning in the direction of the arrow are thereby advised that so long as the turn
37 arrow is illuminated, oncoming or opposing traffic simultaneously faces a steady
38 red signal.
39 (b) A person driving a motorcycle, moped or trimobile or riding a bicycle, an
40 electric bicycle or an electric scooter facing the signal may proceed straight through
41 or turn in the direction opposite that indicated by the green turn arrow if:
42 (1) The person stops before entering the crosswalk on the nearest side of
43 the intersection where the sign or pavement marking indicates where the stop must
44 be made or, in the absence of any such crosswalk, sign or marking, before entering
45 the intersection;
46 (2) The person waits for two complete cycles of the lights or lighted arrows
47 of the applicable official traffic-control device and the signal does not change
48 because of a malfunction or because the signal failed to detect the presence of the
49 motorcycle, moped, trimobile, bicycle, electric bicycle or electric scooter;
50 (3) No other device at the place prohibits the turn, if applicable; and
51 (4) The person yields the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an
52 adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection.

3 10. If a person violates paragraph (d) of subsection 8 or paragraph (b) of
4 subsection 9 and that violation results in an injury to another person, the violation
5 creates a rebuttable presumption of all facts necessary to impose civil liability for
6 the injury.
7 11. If a signal is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection,
8 the provisions of this section are applicable except as to those provisions which by
9 their nature can have no application. Any stop required must be made at a sign or
10 pavement marking indicating where the stop must be made, but in the absence of
11 any such device the stop must be made at the signal.
12 12. Whenever signals are placed over the individual lanes of a highway, the
13 signals indicate, and apply to drivers of vehicles, as follows:

20 (a) The red signal is exhibited; and
21 (b) The vehicular traffic in question had already completely entered the
22 intersection before the red signal was exhibited. For the purposes of this paragraph,
23 a vehicle shall be considered to have “completely entered” an intersection when all
24 portions of the vehicle have crossed the limit line or other point of demarcation
25 behind which vehicular traffic must stop when a red signal is displayed.
26 14. A person who violates any provision of this section may be subject to the
27 additional penalty set forth in NRS 484B.135 [.] or section 2 of this act.
