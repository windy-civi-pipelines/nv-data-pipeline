AN ACT relating to public safety; revising provisions governing
regulation and designation of school zones and school

thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the governing body of a local government or the
2 Department of Transportation to designate school zones and school crossing zones.
3 In relevant part, existing law does not prohibit a person from driving at certain
4 speeds, making a U-turn or overtaking and passing another vehicle in a school zone
5 or school crossing zone, as applicable, during the period from a half hour after
6 school is no longer in operation to a half hour before school is next in operation.
7 (NRS 484B.363) Section 24 of this bill revises this provision to require the
8 governing body or the Department which designated the school zone or school
9 crossing zone, as applicable, to specify one or more periods in which a person is not
10 prohibited from performing these acts in a school zone or school crossing zone.

11 However, section 24 provides that any such period may not encompass the 30
12 minutes after school is no longer in operation or the 30 minutes before school is
13 next in operation.
14 Existing law establishes certain requirements related to signs and other devices
15 designating school zones and school crossing zones. (NRS 268.425, 269.185,
16 484B.363, 484B.367) Section 25 of this bill requires the governing body or the
17 Department which designated the school zone or school crossing zone, as
18 applicable, to: (1) place signs in certain locations indicating the presence of a
19 school zone or school crossing zone; and (2) prescribe standards for the design,
20 application, installation and maintenance of the signs designating the conditions
21 that apply to school zones and school crossing zones. Section 25 also authorizes the
22 governing body and the Department to consult and collaborate with certain officers
23 and entities regarding the standards. Sections 35 and 36 of this bill make
24 conforming changes related to the standards applicable to the signs and other
25 devices in school zones and school crossing zones.
26 Existing law provides that a person who commits certain traffic violations in a
27 work zone or a pedestrian safety zone may be subject to double the penalty for the
28 underlying offense or infraction, subject to certain limitations. (NRS 484B.130,
29 484B.135) Section 2 of this bill similarly provides that a person who commits
30 certain traffic violations in an active school zone or active school crossing zone
31 may be subject to double the penalty for the underlying offense or infraction,
32 subject to certain limitations. Section 2 also provides that a person who commits
33 such traffic violations in an active school zone or active school crossing zone is
34 subject to an assessment of twice the number of demerit points assigned to the
35 underlying offense. Sections 1, 3-23 and 26-34 of this bill make conforming
36 changes related to the enhanced penalty prescribed by section 2.
37 Existing law sets forth certain requirements governing the privacy of data
38 concerning pupils. (NRS 388.267-388.296) Section 36.3 of this bill prohibits a
39 public school from including certain information concerning a pupil in a directory
40 of pupils maintained by the school. Section 36.4 of this bill prohibits a school
41 district or public school from disclosing the phone number or address of any pupil
42 or parent or legal guardian of a pupil unless required in certain circumstances.

16 (a) Vehicular traffic facing the signal must stop before entering
17 the crosswalk on the nearest side of the intersection where the sign
18 or pavement marking indicates where the stop must be made, or in
19 the absence of any such crosswalk, sign or marking, then before
20 entering the intersection, and, except as otherwise provided in
21 paragraphs (c) and (d), must remain stopped or standing until the
22 green signal is shown.
23 (b) Pedestrians facing such a signal shall not enter the highway,
24 unless permitted to proceed by another device as provided in
25 NRS 484B.283.
26 (c) After complying with the requirement to stop, vehicular
27 traffic facing such a signal and situated on the extreme right of the
28 highway may proceed into the intersection for a right turn only

10 traffic facing the signal may enter the intersection only to make the
11 movement indicated by the green turn arrow, but must yield the
12 right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk
13 and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection. Drivers turning in
14 the direction of the arrow are thereby advised that so long as the turn
15 arrow is illuminated, oncoming or opposing traffic simultaneously
16 faces a steady red signal.
17 (b) A person driving a motorcycle, moped or trimobile or riding
18 a bicycle, an electric bicycle or an electric scooter facing the signal
19 may proceed straight through or turn in the direction opposite that

22 nearest side of the intersection where the sign or pavement marking
23 indicates where the stop must be made or, in the absence of any
24 such crosswalk, sign or marking, before entering the intersection;
25 (2) The person waits for two complete cycles of the lights or
26 lighted arrows of the applicable official traffic-control device and
27 the signal does not change because of a malfunction or because the
28 signal failed to detect the presence of the motorcycle, moped,
29 trimobile, bicycle, electric bicycle or electric scooter;

35 (c) Pedestrians facing such a signal shall not enter the highway,
36 unless permitted to proceed by another device as provided in
37 NRS 484B.283.
38 10. If a person violates paragraph (d) of subsection 8 or
39 paragraph (b) of subsection 9 and that violation results in an injury
40 to another person, the violation creates a rebuttable presumption of
41 all facts necessary to impose civil liability for the injury.
