on Public Safety and Security
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to public safety; revising provisions governing
regulation and designation of school zones and school
crossing zones; revising provisions relating to signs in school
zones and school crossing zones; providing for enhanced
penalties for certain traffic violations in active school zones
and school crossing zones; prohibiting the inclusion of
certain information concerning pupils within a directory of
pupils; prohibiting the provision of certain information
concerning pupils to third parties; providing penalties; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law requires the governing body of a local government or the
Department of Transportation to designate school zones and school crossing zones.
In relevant part, existing law does not prohibit a person from driving at certain
speeds, making a U-turn or overtaking and passing another vehicle in a school zone
or school crossing zone, as applicable, during the period from a half hour after
school is no longer in operation to a half hour before school is next in operation.
(NRS 484B.363) Section 24 of this bill revises this provision to require the
governing body or the Department which designated the school zone or school
crossing zone, as applicable, to specify one or more periods in which a person is not
prohibited from performing these acts in a school zone or school crossing zone.
However, section 24 provides that any such period may not encompass the 30
minutes after school is no longer in operation or the 30 minutes before school is
next in operation.
Existing law establishes certain requirements related to signs and other devices
designating school zones and school crossing zones. (NRS 268.425, 269.185,
484B.363, 484B.367) Section 25 of this bill requires the governing body or the
Department which designated the school zone or school crossing zone, as
applicable, to: (1) place signs in certain locations indicating the presence of a
school zone or school crossing zone; and (2) prescribe standards for the design,
application, installation and maintenance of the signs designating the conditions
that apply to school zones and school crossing zones. Section 25 also authorizes the
governing body and the Department to consult and collaborate with certain officers
and entities regarding the standards. Sections 35 and 36 of this bill make
conforming changes related to the standards applicable to the signs and other
devices in school zones and school crossing zones.
Existing law provides that a person who commits certain traffic violations in a
work zone or a pedestrian safety zone may be subject to double the penalty for the
underlying offense or infraction, subject to certain limitations. (NRS 484B.130,
484B.135) Section 2 of this bill similarly provides that a person who commits
certain traffic violations in an active school zone or active school crossing zone
may be subject to double the penalty for the underlying offense or infraction,
subject to certain limitations. Section 2 also provides that a person who commits
such traffic violations in an active school zone or active school crossing zone is
subject to an assessment of twice the number of demerit points assigned to the
-

underlying offense. Sections 1, 3-23 and 26-34 of this bill make conforming
changes related to the enhanced penalty prescribed by section 2.
Existing law sets forth certain requirements governing the privacy of data
concerning pupils. (NRS 388.267-388.296) Section 36.3 of this bill prohibits a
public school from including certain information concerning a pupil in a directory
of pupils maintained by the school. Section 36.4 of this bill prohibits a school
district or public school from disclosing the phone number or address of any pupil
or parent or legal guardian of a pupil unless required in certain circumstances.

thereof indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles and pedestrians as
provided in this section.
2. When the signal is circular green alone:
(a) Vehicular traffic facing the signal may proceed straight
through or turn right or left unless another device at the place
prohibits either or both such turns. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left, must yield the right-of-way to other
vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an
adjacent crosswalk at the time the signal is exhibited.
(b) Pedestrians facing such a signal may proceed across the
highway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk, unless directed
otherwise by another device as provided in NRS 484B.283.
3. Where the signal is circular green with a green turn arrow:
(a) Vehicular traffic facing the signal may proceed to make the
movement indicated by the green turn arrow or such other
movement as is permitted by the circular green signal, but the traffic
must yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an
adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the
intersection at the time the signal is exhibited. Drivers turning in the
direction of the arrow when displayed with the circular green are
thereby advised that so long as a turn arrow is illuminated,
oncoming or opposing traffic simultaneously faces a steady red
signal.
(b) Pedestrians facing such a signal may proceed across the
highway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk, unless directed
otherwise by another device as provided in NRS 484B.283.

signal is exhibited.
(b) Pedestrians facing such a signal may proceed across the
highway within the appropriate marked or unmarked crosswalk,
unless directed otherwise by another device as provided in
NRS 484B.283.
6. Where the signal is a steady yellow signal alone:
(a) Vehicular traffic facing the signal is thereby warned that the
related green movement is being terminated or that a steady red
indication will be exhibited immediately thereafter, and such
vehicular traffic must not enter the intersection when the red signal
is exhibited.
(b) Pedestrians facing such a signal, unless otherwise directed
by another device as provided in NRS 484B.283, are thereby
advised that there is insufficient time to cross the highway.
7. Where the signal is a flashing yellow turn arrow, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal:
(a) Vehicular traffic facing the signal is permitted to cautiously
enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by the
arrow signal, or other such movement as is permitted by other signal
indications displayed at the same time. Such vehicular traffic must
yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection
or an adjacent crosswalk and yield the right-of-way to other traffic
lawfully within the intersection.
(b) Pedestrians facing such a signal, unless otherwise directed
by another device as provided in NRS 484B.283, are thereby
advised that there may be insufficient time to cross the highway, but
may proceed across the highway within the appropriate marked or
unmarked crosswalk.
8. Where the signal is a steady red signal alone:
(a) Vehicular traffic facing the signal must stop before entering
the crosswalk on the nearest side of the intersection where the sign
or pavement marking indicates where the stop must be made, or in
the absence of any such crosswalk, sign or marking, then before
entering the intersection, and, except as otherwise provided in
paragraphs (c) and (d), must remain stopped or standing until the
green signal is shown.
(b) Pedestrians facing such a signal shall not enter the highway,
unless permitted to proceed by another device as provided in
NRS 484B.283.
(c) After complying with the requirement to stop, vehicular
traffic facing such a signal and situated on the extreme right of the
highway may proceed into the intersection for a right turn only
-
36th Special Session (2025)

– 19 –
when the intersecting highway is two-directional or one-way to the
right, or vehicular traffic facing such a signal and situated on
the extreme left of a one-way highway may proceed into the
intersection for a left turn only when the intersecting highway is
one-way to the left, but must yield the right-of-way to pedestrians
and other traffic proceeding as directed by the signal at the
intersection.
(d) After complying with the requirement to stop, a person
driving a motorcycle, moped or trimobile or riding a bicycle, an
electric bicycle or an electric scooter may proceed straight through
or turn right or left if:
(1) The person waits for two complete cycles of the lights or
lighted arrows of the applicable official traffic-control device and
the signal does not change because of a malfunction or because the
signal failed to detect the presence of the motorcycle, moped,
trimobile, bicycle, electric bicycle or electric scooter;
(2) No other device at the place prohibits either or both such
turns, if applicable; and
(3) The person yields the right-of-way to pedestrians and
other traffic proceeding as directed by the signal at the intersection.
(e) Vehicular traffic facing the signal may not proceed on or
through any private or public property to enter the intersecting street
where traffic is not facing a red signal to avoid the red signal.
9. Where the signal is a steady red with a green turn arrow:
(a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b), vehicular
traffic facing the signal may enter the intersection only to make the
movement indicated by the green turn arrow, but must yield the
right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk
and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection. Drivers turning in
the direction of the arrow are thereby advised that so long as the turn
arrow is illuminated, oncoming or opposing traffic simultaneously
faces a steady red signal.
(b) A person driving a motorcycle, moped or trimobile or riding
a bicycle, an electric bicycle or an electric scooter facing the signal
may proceed straight through or turn in the direction opposite that
indicated by the green turn arrow if:
(1) The person stops before entering the crosswalk on the
nearest side of the intersection where the sign or pavement marking
indicates where the stop must be made or, in the absence of any
such crosswalk, sign or marking, before entering the intersection;
(2) The person waits for two complete cycles of the lights or
lighted arrows of the applicable official traffic-control device and
the signal does not change because of a malfunction or because the

lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully
using the intersection.
(c) Pedestrians facing such a signal shall not enter the highway,
unless permitted to proceed by another device as provided in
NRS 484B.283.
10. If a person violates paragraph (d) of subsection 8 or
paragraph (b) of subsection 9 and that violation results in an injury
to another person, the violation creates a rebuttable presumption of
all facts necessary to impose civil liability for the injury.
11. If a signal is erected and maintained at a place other than an
intersection, the provisions of this section are applicable except as to
those provisions which by their nature can have no application. Any
stop required must be made at a sign or pavement marking
indicating where the stop must be made, but in the absence of any
such device the stop must be made at the signal.
12. Whenever signals are placed over the individual lanes of a
highway, the signals indicate, and apply to drivers of vehicles, as
follows:
(a) A downward-pointing green arrow means that a driver facing
the signal may drive in any lane over which the green signal is
shown.
(b) A red “X” symbol means a driver facing the signal must not
enter or drive in any lane over which the red signal is shown.
13. A local authority shall not adopt an ordinance or regulation
or take any other action that prohibits vehicular traffic from crossing
an intersection when:
(a) The red signal is exhibited; and
(b) The vehicular traffic in question had already completely
entered the intersection before the red signal was exhibited. For the
purposes of this paragraph, a vehicle shall be considered to have
“completely entered” an intersection when all portions of the vehicle
have crossed the limit line or other point of demarcation behind
which vehicular traffic must stop when a red signal is displayed.
14. A person who violates any provision of this section may be
subject to the additional penalty set forth in NRS 484B.135 [.] or
section 2 of this act.
