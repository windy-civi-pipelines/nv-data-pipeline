Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the governing body of a local government or the
2 Department of Transportation to designate school zones and school crossing zones.
3 In relevant part, existing law does not prohibit a person from driving at certain
4 speeds, making a U-turn or overtaking and passing another vehicle in a school zone
5 or school crossing zone, as applicable, during the period from a half hour after
6 school is no longer in operation to a half hour before school is next in operation.
7 (NRS 484B.363) Section 24 of this bill revises this provision to require the
-

– 2 –
8 governing body or the Department which designated the school zone or school
9 crossing zone, as applicable, to specify one or more periods in which a person is not
10 prohibited from performing these acts in a school zone or school crossing zone.
11 However, section 24 provides that any such period may not encompass the 30
12 minutes after school is no longer in operation or the 30 minutes before school is
13 next in operation.
14 Existing law establishes certain requirements related to signs and other devices
15 designating school zones and school crossing zones. (NRS 268.425, 269.185,
16 484B.363, 484B.367) Section 25 of this bill requires the governing body or the
17 Department which designated the school zone or school crossing zone, as
18 applicable, to: (1) place signs in certain locations indicating the presence of a
19 school zone or school crossing zone; and (2) prescribe standards for the design,
20 application, installation and maintenance of the signs designating the conditions
21 that apply to school zones and school crossing zones. Section 25 also authorizes the
22 governing body and the Department to consult and collaborate with certain officers
23 and entities regarding the standards. Sections 35 and 36 of this bill make
24 conforming changes related to the standards applicable to the signs and other
25 devices in school zones and school crossing zones.
26 Existing law provides that a person who commits certain traffic violations in a
27 work zone or a pedestrian safety zone may be subject to double the penalty for the
28 underlying offense or infraction, subject to certain limitations. (NRS 484B.130,
29 484B.135) Section 2 of this bill similarly provides that a person who commits
30 certain traffic violations in an active school zone or active school crossing zone
31 may be subject to double the penalty for the underlying offense or infraction,
32 subject to certain limitations. Section 2 also provides that a person who commits
33 such traffic violations in an active school zone or active school crossing zone is
34 subject to an assessment of twice the number of demerit points assigned to the
35 underlying offense. Sections 1, 3-23 and 26-34 of this bill make conforming
36 changes related to the enhanced penalty prescribed by section 2.
37 Existing law sets forth certain requirements governing the privacy of data
38 concerning pupils. (NRS 388.267-388.296) Section 36.3 of this bill prohibits a
39 public school from including certain information concerning a pupil in a directory
40 of pupils maintained by the school. Section 36.4 of this bill prohibits a school
41 district or public school from disclosing the personally identifiable information of
42 any pupil or parent or legal guardian of a pupil unless required in certain
43 circumstances. Section 36.4 additionally: (1) authorizes a third party to request
44 information contained in a directory pursuant to section 36.3; and (2) sets forth the
45 method for submitting such a request. Section 36.4 additionally authorizes a pupil
46 who is at least 18 years of age or the parent or legal guardian of a pupil who is less
47 than 18 years of age to reject the provision of such information concerning the
48 pupil. Furthermore, section 36.4 requires the compilation of lists containing certain
49 information about requests for information concerning pupils submitted pursuant to
50 section 36.4.

13 an ordinarily observant person. Whenever a particular provision of
14 chapters 484A to 484E, inclusive, of NRS does not state that such
15 devices are required, the provision is effective even though no
16 devices are erected or in place.
17 3. Whenever devices are placed in position approximately
18 conforming to the requirements of chapters 484A to 484E, inclusive,
19 of NRS, such devices are presumed to have been so placed by the

11 alone or in combination with another signal:
12 (a) Vehicular traffic facing the signal is permitted to cautiously
13 enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by the
14 arrow signal, or other such movement as is permitted by other signal
15 indications displayed at the same time. Such vehicular traffic must
16 yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection
17 or an adjacent crosswalk and yield the right-of-way to other traffic
18 lawfully within the intersection.
19 (b) Pedestrians facing such a signal, unless otherwise directed
20 by another device as provided in NRS 484B.283, are thereby

25 (a) Vehicular traffic facing the signal must stop before entering
26 the crosswalk on the nearest side of the intersection where the sign
27 or pavement marking indicates where the stop must be made, or in
28 the absence of any such crosswalk, sign or marking, then before
29 entering the intersection, and, except as otherwise provided in
30 paragraphs (c) and (d), must remain stopped or standing until the
31 green signal is shown.
32 (b) Pedestrians facing such a signal shall not enter the highway,
33 unless permitted to proceed by another device as provided in
34 NRS 484B.283.
35 (c) After complying with the requirement to stop, vehicular
36 traffic facing such a signal and situated on the extreme right of the
37 highway may proceed into the intersection for a right turn only
38 when the intersecting highway is two-directional or one-way to the
39 right, or vehicular traffic facing such a signal and situated on
40 the extreme left of a one-way highway may proceed into the
41 intersection for a left turn only when the intersecting highway is
42 one-way to the left, but must yield the right-of-way to pedestrians
43 and other traffic proceeding as directed by the signal at the
44 intersection.

18 (a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b), vehicular
19 traffic facing the signal may enter the intersection only to make the
20 movement indicated by the green turn arrow, but must yield the
21 right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk
22 and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection. Drivers turning in
23 the direction of the arrow are thereby advised that so long as the turn
24 arrow is illuminated, oncoming or opposing traffic simultaneously
25 faces a steady red signal.
26 (b) A person driving a motorcycle, moped or trimobile or riding
27 a bicycle, an electric bicycle or an electric scooter facing the signal
28 may proceed straight through or turn in the direction opposite that
29 indicated by the green turn arrow if:
30 (1) The person stops before entering the crosswalk on the
31 nearest side of the intersection where the sign or pavement marking
32 indicates where the stop must be made or, in the absence of any
33 such crosswalk, sign or marking, before entering the intersection;
34 (2) The person waits for two complete cycles of the lights or
35 lighted arrows of the applicable official traffic-control device and
36 the signal does not change because of a malfunction or because the
37 signal failed to detect the presence of the motorcycle, moped,
38 trimobile, bicycle, electric bicycle or electric scooter;

23 or take any other action that prohibits vehicular traffic from crossing
24 an intersection when:
25 (a) The red signal is exhibited; and
26 (b) The vehicular traffic in question had already completely
27 entered the intersection before the red signal was exhibited. For the
28 purposes of this paragraph, a vehicle shall be considered to have
29 “completely entered” an intersection when all portions of the vehicle
30 have crossed the limit line or other point of demarcation behind
31 which vehicular traffic must stop when a red signal is displayed.
32 14. A person who violates any provision of this section may be
33 subject to the additional penalty set forth in NRS 484B.135 [.] or
34 section 2 of this act.
