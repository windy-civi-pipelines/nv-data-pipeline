Assembly Bill No. 3–Select Committee
on Public Safety and Security
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to public office; authorizing a public officer to
request that certain personal information contained in the
records of the Secretary of State, a county or city clerk,
county recorder or county assessor be kept confidential;
authorizing a candidate or public officer to use campaign
contributions to pay for expenses relating to personal
security; authorizing a public officer to request that the
Department of Motor Vehicles display an alternate address
on the person’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s license
or identification card; providing penalties; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law authorizes certain persons and the spouse, domestic partner or
minor child thereof, to request a court order to require that the Secretary of State, a
county or city clerk, county recorder or county assessor maintain the personal
information of the person contained in their records in a confidential manner. A
person who wishes to have such personal information be kept confidential is
required to obtain an order of a court, based on a sworn affidavit by the person,
requiring the Secretary of State, a county or city clerk, county recorder or county
assessor to maintain the personal information in a confidential manner. The
Secretary of State, a county or city clerk, county recorder or county assessor is
authorized to provide such confidential information for use in certain limited
circumstances and to deny a request for confidential information if he or she
reasonably believes that the information may be used in an unauthorized manner.
(NRS 247.500-247.600, 250.100-250.230, 293.900-293.920) Sections 3, 8 and 9 of
this bill add public officers to the lists of people authorized to request that personal
information contained in the records of the Secretary of State, a county or city
clerk, county recorder or county assessor be kept confidential.
Existing law requires a candidate for an elected office to file a declaration of
candidacy and declaration of residency with the appropriate filing officer. Existing
law provides that the declaration of candidacy and declaration of residency are a
public record which must be made available to the public in electronic format.
Existing law also requires the filing officer to retain a copy of the proof of identity
and residency provided by the candidate and prohibits the copy from being
withheld from the public. (NRS 293.177, 293.181, 293C.185) Sections 1, 2 and 4
of this bill provide that any information required to be kept confidential by the
Secretary of State or county or city clerk pursuant to a court order obtained from an
authorized person who has requested his or her personal information be maintained
in a confidential manner is an exception to these requirements.
Existing law authorizes certain persons to request that the Department of Motor
Vehicles display an alternate address on the person’s driver’s license, commercial
driver’s license or identification card. (NRS 481.091) Section 10 of this bill
additionally authorizes any public officer to make such a request.
Existing law makes it unlawful for a candidate or public officer to spend money
received as a contribution for his or her “personal use,” which is defined as any use
of contributions to fulfill a commitment, obligation or expense of a candidate or
-

– 2 –
public officer that would exist irrespective of his or her campaign or public office,
as applicable. (NRS 294A.011, 294A.160) Section 5 of this bill provides that
expenses related to personal security are a campaign expense. Section 6 of this bill
provides that “personal use” of campaign contributions does not include, without
limitation, the use of contributions to fulfill a commitment, obligation or expense
for personal security incurred in direct connection to the campaign of a candidate or
public office of a public officer. Section 7 of this bill requires that expenses related
to personal security be reported on campaign finance reports as a campaign
expense.
