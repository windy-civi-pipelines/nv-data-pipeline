AN ACT relating to public office; authorizing a public officer to
request that certain personal information contained in the
records of the Secretary of State, a county or city clerk,
county recorder or county assessor be kept confidential;
authorizing a candidate or public officer to use campaign

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes certain persons and the spouse, domestic partner or
2 minor child thereof, to request a court order to require that the Secretary of State, a
3 county or city clerk, county recorder or county assessor maintain the personal
4 information of the person contained in their records in a confidential manner. A
5 person who wishes to have such personal information be kept confidential is
6 required to obtain an order of a court, based on a sworn affidavit by the person,
7 requiring the Secretary of State, a county or city clerk, county recorder or county
8 assessor to maintain the personal information in a confidential manner. The
9 Secretary of State, a county or city clerk, county recorder or county assessor is
10 authorized to provide such confidential information for use in certain limited
11 circumstances and to deny a request for confidential information if he or she
12 reasonably believes that the information may be used in an unauthorized manner.
13 (NRS 247.500-247.600, 250.100-250.230, 293.900-293.920) Sections 3, 8 and 9 of
14 this bill add public officers to the lists of people authorized to request that personal
15 information contained in the records of the Secretary of State, a county or city
16 clerk, county recorder or county assessor be kept confidential.

17 Existing law requires a candidate for an elected office to file a declaration of
18 candidacy and declaration of residency with the appropriate filing officer. Existing
19 law provides that the declaration of candidacy and declaration of residency are a
20 public record which must be made available to the public in electronic format.
21 Existing law also requires the filing officer to retain a copy of the proof of identity
22 and residency provided by the candidate and prohibits the copy from being
23 withheld from the public. (NRS 293.177, 293.181, 293C.185) Sections 1, 2 and 4
24 of this bill provide that any information required to be kept confidential by the
25 Secretary of State or county or city clerk pursuant to a court order obtained from an
26 authorized person who has requested his or her personal information be maintained
27 in a confidential manner is an exception to these requirements.
28 Existing law authorizes certain persons to request that the Department of Motor
29 Vehicles display an alternate address on the person’s driver’s license, commercial
30 driver’s license or identification card. (NRS 481.091) Section 10 of this bill
31 additionally authorizes any public officer to make such a request.
32 Existing law makes it unlawful for a candidate or public officer to spend money
33 received as a contribution for his or her “personal use,” which is defined as any use
34 of contributions to fulfill a commitment, obligation or expense of a candidate or
35 public officer that would exist irrespective of his or her campaign or public office,
36 as applicable. (NRS 294A.011, 294A.160) Section 5 of this bill provides that
37 expenses related to personal security are a campaign expense. Section 6 of this bill
38 provides that “personal use” of campaign contributions does not include, without
39 limitation, the use of contributions to fulfill a commitment, obligation or expense
40 for personal security incurred in direct connection to the campaign of a candidate or
41 public office of a public officer. Section 7 of this bill requires that expenses related
42 to personal security be reported on campaign finance reports as a campaign
43 expense.
