EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to motor vehicles; revising requirements that a
short-term lessor require proof of certain insurance as a
condition for the lease of a passenger car; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires a short-term lessor to require, as a condition for the lease
2 of a passenger car, proof of insurance that satisfies certain minimum insurance
3 coverage requirements. (NRS 482.31565) This bill instead authorizes, rather than
4 requires, a short-term lessor to require proof of such insurance as a condition for the
5 lease of a passenger car.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 482.31565 is hereby amended to read as
2 follows:
3 482.31565 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2, a
4 short-term lessor shall not require the purchase of a waiver of
5 damages, optional insurance or any other optional good or service as
6 a condition for the lease of a passenger car.
7 2. A short-term lessor [shall] may require that a person seeking
8 to lease a passenger car provide proof of insurance that satisfies the
9 minimum amount of insurance coverage set forth in NRS 485.185 as
10 a condition for the lease of the passenger car. If a person seeking to

1 lease a passenger car cannot provide proof of such insurance, the
2 short-term lessor may:
3 (a) Sell the person a temporary policy of insurance that satisfies
4 the minimum amount of coverage set forth in NRS 485.185 or refer
5 the person to a third-party that sells a temporary policy of insurance
6 that satisfies such requirements. A temporary policy of insurance
7 offered or referred for sale by a short-term lessor must be offered at
8 a rate that does not exceed the standard market rate for similar
9 policies of insurance.
10 (b) If the person refuses to purchase a temporary policy of
11 insurance, refuse to lease the passenger car to the person.
12 3. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, a short-term
13 lessor may sell a waiver of damages but shall charge:
14 (a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b), not more than
15 $22 per full or partial rental day or 24-hour rental period, as
16 appropriate, for the waiver. The amount of the charge set forth in
17 this paragraph must be adjusted for each fiscal year that begins on or
18 after July 1, 2008, by adding to that amount the product of that
19 amount multiplied by the percentage increase in the Consumer Price
20 Index West Urban for All Urban Consumers (All Items) between the
21 calendar year ending on December 31, 2005, and the calendar year
22 immediately preceding the fiscal year for which the adjustment is
23 made. The Department shall, on or before March 1 of each year,
24 publish the adjusted amount for the next fiscal year on its Internet
25 website or otherwise make that information available to short-term
26 lessors.
27 (b) If the vehicle has a manufacturer’s suggested retail price of
28 more than $60,000, not more than $150 per full or partial rental day
29 or 24-hour rental period, as appropriate, for the waiver. The
30 monetary amounts set forth in this paragraph must be adjusted for
31 each fiscal year that begins on or after July 1, 2021, by adding to
32 each amount the product of that amount multiplied by the
33 percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index West Urban for
34 All Urban Consumers (All Items) between the calendar year ending
35 on December 31, 2017, and the calendar year immediately
36 preceding the fiscal year for which the adjustment is made. The
37 Department shall, on or before March 1 of each year, publish the
38 adjusted amounts for the next fiscal year on its Internet website or
39 otherwise make that information available to short-term lessors.
40 4. A short-term lessor who disseminates an advertisement in
41 the State of Nevada that contains a rate for the lease of a passenger
42 car shall include in the advertisement a clearly readable statement of
43 the charge for a waiver of damages and a statement that the waiver
44 is optional.

1 5. A short-term lessor shall not engage in any unfair, deceptive
2 or coercive conduct to induce a short-term lessee to purchase a
3 waiver of damages, optional insurance or any other optional good or
4 service, including, but not limited to, refusing to honor the lessee’s
5 reservation, limiting the availability of cars, requiring a deposit or
6 debiting or blocking the lessee’s credit card account for a sum
7 equivalent to a deposit if the lessee declines to purchase a waiver,
8 optional insurance or any other optional good or service.
9 6. For the purposes of subsection 5, the sale of a policy of
10 insurance by a short-term lessor in accordance with the provisions
11 of subsection 2 does not constitute engaging in any unfair, deceptive
12 or coercive conduct in violation of subsection 5.
13 Sec. 2. Notwithstanding the provisions of NRS 218D.430 and
14 218D.435, a committee may vote on this act before the expiration of
15 the period prescribed for the return of a fiscal note in NRS
16 218D.475. This section applies retroactively from and after
17 November 13, 2025.
18 Sec. 3. This act becomes effective upon passage and approval.
