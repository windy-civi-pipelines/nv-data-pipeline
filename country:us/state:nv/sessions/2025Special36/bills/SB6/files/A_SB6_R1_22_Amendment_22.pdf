10 [8.] 15. It is the intent of the Legislature that because of the
11 conditions existing in the Windsor Park neighborhood, as described in
12 section 2 of the Windsor Park Environmental Justice Act, and because it
13 is the intent of the Legislature that the single-family residences and
14 vacant lots in the Windsor Park neighborhood that are exchanged
15 pursuant to this section be demolished and replaced by a park pursuant to
16 subsection 16, an owner of a single-family residence or vacant lot in the
17 Windsor Park neighborhood who is voluntarily exchanging the single-
18 family residence or vacant lot for a new single-family residence or vacant
19 lot under the provisions of this section is making such an exchange
20 because of the destruction, in whole or in part, of the single-family
21 residence or vacant lot as a result of the conditions described in section 2

30 the purposes of creating the public park, the entity selected by the
31 Housing Division pursuant to subsection 3 to develop single-family
32 residences must be engaged under an agreement with the Housing
33 Division, which may act as custodian of the land on which the park is to
34 be constructed and may consult with entities that applied for or received
35 any grants of money to construct City View Park in the Windsor Park
36 neighborhood. The agreement must be separate from any agreement
37 entered into pursuant to subsection 6, for any additional work necessary
38 to develop and construct the public park, including, without limitation,
39 the demolition of any residences transferred pursuant to this section and ,
40 if necessary to construct a park pursuant to this subsection, the
41 acquisition of any parcel of land owned by a private party on which a
42 residence is located that has not been transferred pursuant to this section.
43 Any agreement for the demolition of the residences pursuant to this
44 subsection is exempt from the provisions of state law governing the award
45 of a contract by governmental entities, and any payments pursuant to
46 such an agreement, including, without limitation, any payments to
47 acquire any parcel of land owned by a private party on which a residence
48 is located that has not been transferred pursuant to this section, must be
49 paid entirely from money appropriated by the Legislature for that
50 purpose. The agreement may authorize the retention or reuse of existing
51 public or private infrastructure and materials used in connection with
52 such infrastructure, including, without limitation, streets, sidewalks,
53 lighting, water meters, curbs and foundations, if such retention or reuse

2 to this subsection, the City shall maintain the property as a public park
