1 Existing law contains the Windsor Park Environmental Justice Act, which
2 establishes a program for the relocation of persons residing in the Windsor Park
3 neighborhood of the City of North Las Vegas whose residences have been damaged
4 by the sinking of the ground beneath the residences. (Chapter 531, Statutes of
5 Nevada 2023, at page 3538) Under the Act, the Housing Division of the
6 Department of Business and Industry is required to establish and administer a
7 program by which the owner of a single-family residence in the Windsor Park
8 neighborhood who owns the residence on July 1, 2023, may exchange the residence
9 in the Windsor Park neighborhood for a new residence constructed in accordance
10 with the Act. (Section 9 of chapter 531, Statutes of Nevada 2023, at page 3540)
11 This bill makes revisions to the Act.
12 Section 1 of this bill requires the Housing Division to: (1) adopt regulations to
13 carry out the provisions of the Act, including, without limitation, regulations
14 governing certain specific topics; and (2) provide quarterly reports to the Interim
15 Finance Committee concerning the implementation of the provisions of the Act.
16 Section 2 of this bill clarifies the boundaries of the Windsor Park neighborhood
17 for the purposes of determining the owners of single-family residences or vacant
18 lots who are eligible to participate in the program.
19 Section 3 of this bill: (1) requires that, to be eligible to participate in the
20 program, an owner of a single-family residence or vacant lot in the Windsor Park
21 neighborhood must have owned that single-family residence or lot on August 1,
22 2025, rather than July 1, 2023; (2) authorizes a person who is the owner of a vacant
23 lot in the Windsor Park neighborhood and who was the owner, or is the descendant
24 of the former owner, of a single-family residence that was formerly located on that
25 vacant lot in the Windsor Park neighborhood to participate in the program by
26 exchanging the vacant lot for another vacant lot in an area as near as reasonably
27 practicable to the Windsor Park neighborhood; (3) authorizes a person who resides
28 in the Windsor Park neighborhood to establish that he or she is the owner of a
29 single-family residence or a vacant lot in the Windsor Park neighborhood, and,
30 thus, is eligible to participate in the program, by executing an affidavit, under
31 penalty of perjury, or presenting certain other documentation to establish
32 inheritance or ownership of the property; (4) establishes that the number of new
33 single-family residences to be constructed must be based on an eligibility list
34 verified by the Housing Division; (5) authorizes assistance to pay off, discharge or
35 transfer liens that prevent an exchange under the Act; (6) provides that until July 1,
36 2057, a single-family residence acquired pursuant to the Act is entitled to an
37 abatement of a certain amount of property taxes levied on the single-family
38 residence; (7) provides an exemption from taxes on the transfer of real property for
39 certain transfers of a single-family residence pursuant to the Act; (8) requires the
40 Housing Division to file a lien on the single-family residence acquired pursuant to
41 the Act to secure repayment of certain amounts if the new residence is sold within 5
42 years after the filing of the lien; (9) authorizes a mortgage on a single-family
43 residence in the Windsor Park neighborhood to be transferred to the new residence
44 acquired under the Act; (10) limits the amount of any assistance provided to pay off
45 a mortgage on a single-family residence in the Windsor Park neighborhood to the
46 payoff amount on May 25, 2025, unless certain circumstances exist authorizing an
47 additional amount to be paid off; (11) authorizes the closing of the transaction for
48 the exchange of a single-family residence or vacant lot under the Act to be an
49 escrow process with the issuance of certain title insurance and provides for the
50 payment of certain fees and charges associated with such a transaction; (12)
51 expresses the intent of the Legislature that because of the circumstances existing in
52 the Windsor Park neighborhood, for the purposes of federal income taxation, the
53 exchange of a single-family residence or vacant lot under the Act be considered an
54 involuntary exchange as a result of the destruction, in whole or in part, of the
-

– 3 –
55 single-family residence or vacant lot a threatened requisition or condemnation; (13)
56 requires the entity selected to develop and construct a single-family residence
57 pursuant to the Act to perform certain additional work related to the project,
58 without formal bidding under existing state law, including, without limitation,
59 demolishing the homes in the Windsor Park neighborhood for the purposes of
60 creating the public park required under the Act; and (14) authorizes that entity to
61 retain or reuse existing infrastructure rather than demolish such infrastructure under
62 certain circumstances.
63 Section 4 of this bill removes the requirement for the Housing Division to pay
64 moving expenses and restitution to owners of single-family residences in the
65 Windsor Park neighborhood from certain Community Development Block Grant
66 funds transferred to the Housing Division and, instead, requires relocation expenses
67 to be paid from money available for the purposes of the Act and Community
68 Development Block Grant funds to be used only for purposes for which federal law
69 authorizes the use of such funds.
70 Section 6 of this bill appropriates $25,000,000 from the State General Fund to
71 the Housing Division for the purposes of the Act.
