Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law contains the Windsor Park Environmental Justice Act, which
2 establishes a program for the relocation of persons residing in the Windsor Park
3 neighborhood of the City of North Las Vegas whose residences have been damaged
4 by the sinking of the ground beneath the residences. (Chapter 531, Statutes of
5 Nevada 2023, at page 3538) Under the Act, the Housing Division of the
6 Department of Business and Industry is required to establish and administer a
7 program by which the owner of a single-family residence in the Windsor Park
8 neighborhood who owns the residence on July 1, 2023, may exchange the residence
9 in the Windsor Park neighborhood for a new residence constructed in accordance
10 with the Act. (Section 9 of chapter 531, Statutes of Nevada 2023, at page 3540)
11 This bill makes revisions to the Act.
12 Section 1 of this bill requires the Housing Division to: (1) adopt regulations to
13 carry out the provisions of the Act, including, without limitation, regulations
14 governing certain specific topics; and (2) provide quarterly reports to the Interim
15 Finance Committee concerning the implementation of the provisions of the Act.
16 Section 2 of this bill clarifies the boundaries of the Windsor Park neighborhood
17 for the purposes of determining the owners of single-family residences or vacant
18 lots who are eligible to participate in the program.
19 Section 3 of this bill: (1) requires that, to be eligible to participate in the
20 program, an owner of a single-family residence or vacant lot in the Windsor Park
21 neighborhood must have owned that single-family residence or lot on
22 December 31, 2023, rather than July 1, 2023; (2) authorizes a person who is the
23 owner of a vacant lot in the Windsor Park neighborhood and who was the owner, or
24 is the descendant of the former owner, of a single-family residence that was
25 formerly located on that vacant lot in the Windsor Park neighborhood to participate
26 in the program by exchanging the vacant lot for another vacant lot in an area as
27 near as reasonably practicable to the Windsor Park neighborhood; (3) authorizes a
28 person who resides in the Windsor Park neighborhood to establish that he or she is
29 the owner of a single-family residence or a vacant lot in the Windsor Park
30 neighborhood, and, thus, is eligible to participate in the program, by executing an
31 affidavit, under penalty of perjury, or presenting certain other documentation to
32 establish inheritance or ownership of the property; (4) establishes the number of
33 new single-family residences to be constructed; (5) provides that until July 1, 2057,
34 a single-family residence acquired pursuant to the Act is entitled to an abatement of
35 a certain amount of property taxes levied on the single-family residence; (6)
36 provides an exemption from taxes on the transfer of real property for certain
37 transfers of a single-family residence pursuant to the Act; (7) requires the Housing
38 Division to file a lien on the single-family residence acquired pursuant to the Act to
39 secure repayment of certain amounts if the new residence is sold within 5 years
40 after the filing of the lien; (8) authorizes a mortgage on a single-family residence in
41 the Windsor Park neighborhood to be transferred to the new residence acquired
42 under the Act; (9) limits the amount of any assistance provided to pay off a
43 mortgage on a single-family residence in the Windsor Park neighborhood to the
44 payoff amount on May 25, 2025, unless certain circumstances exist authorizing an
45 additional amount to be paid off; (10) requires the closing of the transaction for the
46 exchange of a single-family residence or vacant lot under the Act to be an escrow
47 process with the issuance of certain title insurance and provides for the payment of
48 certain fees and charges associated with such a transaction; (11) expresses the
49 intent of the Legislature that because of the circumstances existing in the Windsor
50 Park neighborhood, for the purposes of federal income taxation, the exchange of a
51 single-family residence under the Act be considered an involuntary exchange as
52 a result of the destruction, in whole or in part, of the single-family residence or a
53 threatened requisition or condemnation; (12) requires the entity selected to develop
54 and construct a single-family residence pursuant to the Act to be engaged to

55 perform certain additional work related to the project, without formal bidding under
56 existing state law, including, without limitation, demolishing the homes in the
57 Windsor Park neighborhood for the purposes of creating the public park required
58 under the Act; and (13) authorizes that entity to retain or reuse existing
59 infrastructure rather than demolish such infrastructure under certain circumstances.
60 Section 4 of this bill removes the requirement for the Housing Division to pay
61 moving expenses and restitution to owners of single-family residences in the
62 Windsor Park neighborhood from certain Community Development Block Grant
63 funds transferred to the Housing Division and, instead, authorizes those funds to be
64 used by the Housing Division to pay relocation expenses for certain owners and
65 tenants.
66 Section 5 of this bill provides that money appropriated from the State General
67 Fund for the purposes of the Act reverts at the end of the 2025-2027 biennium
68 rather than at the end of the 2023-2025 biennium.
69 Section 6 of this bill appropriates $25,000,000 from the State General Fund to
70 the Housing Division for the purposes of the Act.

21 reside in the single-family residence on July 1, 2023.
22 (b) Pay restitution in the amount of $10,000 to the person
23 who was the initial occupant of a single-family residence in
24 the Windsor Park neighborhood, or to the descendants of that

27 (c) Pay] pay the actual [moving] relocation expenses in

36 pursuant to paragraph (c) of subsection 2, the Housing
37 Division shall pay, in an amount not to exceed $10,000 per
38 single-family residence, the cost of rehabilitating a single-

1 whether or not the rehabilitation has been satisfactorily
2 completed.
3 5.] Such relocation expenses may be paid to a person
4 who was the tenant of an owner of a single-family residence

7 program established pursuant to section 9 of this act. To the
8 extent authorized, relocation expenses must be paid in
9 advance directly to the owner or tenant incurring the
10 expenses based on documentation establishing the actual
11 amount of the expenses. To the extent that money transferred
12 to the Housing Division pursuant to subsection 2 is
13 insufficient to make the entire amount of the payments
14 required by subsection 1 or 3 , [or 4,] the Housing Division
15 shall reduce such payments on a pro rata basis. To the extent
16 authorized by federal law governing the use of money from
17 a Community Development Block Grant to pay relocation
18 expenses, subject to such safeguards as the Housing
19 Division deems appropriate to ensure that the objective of
20 the payment is accomplished, the Housing Division shall
21 pay in advance, either to the vendor or to the owner of the
22 single-family residence or tenant, any relocation expenses to
23 which an owner of a single-family residence or tenant is
24 entitled pursuant to this subsection, based upon the
25 submission of quotes by the owner of the single-family
26 residence or the tenant, as applicable.

31 household appliances not included in the development,
32 furniture replacement, fixtures, solar panel reinstallation,
33 temporary lodging up to 30 days and transportation for
34 tenant households only. Any expenses for which federal law
35 governing the use of money from a Community
36 Development Block Grant prohibits payment as relocation
37 expenses must not be considered relocation expenses for the
38 purposes of this section.
