Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law contains the Windsor Park Environmental Justice Act, which
establishes a program for the relocation of persons residing in the Windsor Park
neighborhood of the City of North Las Vegas whose residences have been damaged
by the sinking of the ground beneath the residences. (Chapter 531, Statutes of
Nevada 2023, at page 3538) Under the Act, the Housing Division of the
Department of Business and Industry is required to establish and administer a
program by which the owner of a single-family residence in the Windsor Park
neighborhood who owns the residence on July 1, 2023, may exchange the residence
in the Windsor Park neighborhood for a new residence constructed in accordance
with the Act. (Section 9 of chapter 531, Statutes of Nevada 2023, at page 3540)
This bill makes revisions to the Act.

Section 2:
Section 1 of this bill requires the Housing Division to: (1) adopt regulations to
carry out the provisions of the Act, including, without limitation, regulations
governing certain specific topics; and (2) provide quarterly reports to the Interim
Finance Committee concerning the implementation of the provisions of the Act.

Section 3:
Section 2 of this bill clarifies the boundaries of the Windsor Park neighborhood
for the purposes of determining the owners of single-family residences or vacant
lots who are eligible to participate in the program.

Section 4:
Section 3 of this bill: (1) requires that, to be eligible to participate in the
program, an owner of a single-family residence or vacant lot in the Windsor Park
-

neighborhood must have owned that single-family residence or lot on August 1,
2025, rather than July 1, 2023; (2) authorizes a person who is the owner of a vacant
lot in the Windsor Park neighborhood and who was the owner, or is the descendant
of the former owner, of a single-family residence that was formerly located on that
vacant lot in the Windsor Park neighborhood to participate in the program by
exchanging the vacant lot for another vacant lot in an area as near as reasonably
practicable to the Windsor Park neighborhood; (3) authorizes a person who resides
in the Windsor Park neighborhood to establish that he or she is the owner of a
single-family residence or a vacant lot in the Windsor Park neighborhood, and,
thus, is eligible to participate in the program, by executing an affidavit, under
penalty of perjury, or presenting certain other documentation to establish
inheritance or ownership of the property; (4) establishes that the number of new
single-family residences to be constructed must be based on an eligibility list
verified by the Housing Division; (5) authorizes assistance to pay off, discharge or
transfer liens that prevent an exchange under the Act; (6) provides that until July 1,
2057, a single-family residence acquired pursuant to the Act is entitled to an
abatement of a certain amount of property taxes levied on the single-family
residence; (7) provides an exemption from taxes on the transfer of real property for
certain transfers of a single-family residence pursuant to the Act; (8) requires the
Housing Division to file a lien on the single-family residence acquired pursuant to
the Act to secure repayment of certain amounts if the new residence is sold within 5
years after the filing of the lien; (9) authorizes a mortgage on a single-family
residence in the Windsor Park neighborhood to be transferred to the new residence
acquired under the Act; (10) limits the amount of any assistance provided to pay off
a mortgage on a single-family residence in the Windsor Park neighborhood to the
payoff amount on May 25, 2025, unless certain circumstances exist authorizing an
additional amount to be paid off; (11) authorizes the closing of the transaction for
the exchange of a single-family residence or vacant lot under the Act to be an
escrow process with the issuance of certain title insurance and provides for the
payment of certain fees and charges associated with such a transaction; (12)
expresses the intent of the Legislature that because of the circumstances existing in
the Windsor Park neighborhood, for the purposes of federal income taxation, the
exchange of a single-family residence or vacant lot under the Act be considered an
involuntary exchange as a result of the destruction, in whole or in part, of the
single-family residence or vacant lot a threatened requisition or condemnation; (13)
requires the entity selected to develop and construct a single-family residence
pursuant to the Act to perform certain additional work related to the project,
without formal bidding under existing state law, including, without limitation,
demolishing the homes in the Windsor Park neighborhood for the purposes of
creating the public park required under the Act; and (14) authorizes that entity to
retain or reuse existing infrastructure rather than demolish such infrastructure under
certain circumstances.

Section 5:
Section 4 of this bill removes the requirement for the Housing Division to pay
moving expenses and restitution to owners of single-family residences in the
Windsor Park neighborhood from certain Community Development Block Grant
funds transferred to the Housing Division and, instead, requires relocation expenses
to be paid from money available for the purposes of the Act and Community
Development Block Grant funds to be used only for purposes for which federal law
authorizes the use of such funds.

Section 6:
Section 6 of this bill appropriates $25,000,000 from the State General Fund to
the Housing Division for the purposes of the Act.

this subsection, the acquisition of any parcel of land owned
by a private party on which a residence is located that has

and any payments pursuant to such an agreement,
including, without limitation, any payments to acquire any
parcel of land owned by a private party on which a
residence is located that has not been transferred pursuant
to this section, must be paid entirely from money
appropriated by the Legislature for that purpose. The
agreement may authorize the retention or reuse of existing
public or private infrastructure and materials used in

Park neighborhood for the purposes of determining eligibility
to participate in the program established by the Act; revising
certain requirements to be eligible to acquire a new single-
family residence under the Act; authorizing certain owners of

governing the closing of transactions for the exchange of
single-family residences and vacant lots; revising provisions

governing the use of certain money for the purposes of the

properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law contains the Windsor Park Environmental Justice Act, which
establishes a program for the relocation of persons residing in the Windsor Park
neighborhood of the City of North Las Vegas whose residences have been damaged
by the sinking of the ground beneath the residences. (Chapter 531, Statutes of
Nevada 2023, at page 3538) Under the Act, the Housing Division of the
Department of Business and Industry is required to establish and administer a
program by which the owner of a single-family residence in the Windsor Park
neighborhood who owns the residence on July 1, 2023, may exchange the residence
in the Windsor Park neighborhood for a new residence constructed in accordance
with the Act. (Section 9 of chapter 531, Statutes of Nevada 2023, at page 3540)
This bill makes revisions to the Act.
Section 1 of this bill requires the Housing Division to: (1) adopt regulations to
carry out the provisions of the Act, including, without limitation, regulations
governing certain specific topics; and (2) provide quarterly reports to the Interim
Finance Committee concerning the implementation of the provisions of the Act.
Section 2 of this bill clarifies the boundaries of the Windsor Park neighborhood
for the purposes of determining the owners of single-family residences or vacant
lots who are eligible to participate in the program.
Section 3 of this bill: (1) requires that, to be eligible to participate in the
program, an owner of a single-family residence or vacant lot in the Windsor Park
-
36th Special Session (2025)

– 2 –
neighborhood must have owned that single-family residence or lot on August 1,
2025, rather than July 1, 2023; (2) authorizes a person who is the owner of a vacant
lot in the Windsor Park neighborhood and who was the owner, or is the descendant
of the former owner, of a single-family residence that was formerly located on that
vacant lot in the Windsor Park neighborhood to participate in the program by
exchanging the vacant lot for another vacant lot in an area as near as reasonably
practicable to the Windsor Park neighborhood; (3) authorizes a person who resides
in the Windsor Park neighborhood to establish that he or she is the owner of a
single-family residence or a vacant lot in the Windsor Park neighborhood, and,
thus, is eligible to participate in the program, by executing an affidavit, under
penalty of perjury, or presenting certain other documentation to establish
inheritance or ownership of the property; (4) establishes that the number of new
single-family residences to be constructed must be based on an eligibility list
verified by the Housing Division; (5) authorizes assistance to pay off, discharge or
transfer liens that prevent an exchange under the Act; (6) provides that until July 1,
2057, a single-family residence acquired pursuant to the Act is entitled to an
abatement of a certain amount of property taxes levied on the single-family
residence; (7) provides an exemption from taxes on the transfer of real property for
certain transfers of a single-family residence pursuant to the Act; (8) requires the
Housing Division to file a lien on the single-family residence acquired pursuant to
the Act to secure repayment of certain amounts if the new residence is sold within 5
years after the filing of the lien; (9) authorizes a mortgage on a single-family
residence in the Windsor Park neighborhood to be transferred to the new residence
acquired under the Act; (10) limits the amount of any assistance provided to pay off
a mortgage on a single-family residence in the Windsor Park neighborhood to the
payoff amount on May 25, 2025, unless certain circumstances exist authorizing an
additional amount to be paid off; (11) authorizes the closing of the transaction for
the exchange of a single-family residence or vacant lot under the Act to be an
escrow process with the issuance of certain title insurance and provides for the
payment of certain fees and charges associated with such a transaction; (12)
expresses the intent of the Legislature that because of the circumstances existing in
the Windsor Park neighborhood, for the purposes of federal income taxation, the
exchange of a single-family residence or vacant lot under the Act be considered an
involuntary exchange as a result of the destruction, in whole or in part, of the
single-family residence or vacant lot a threatened requisition or condemnation; (13)
requires the entity selected to develop and construct a single-family residence
pursuant to the Act to perform certain additional work related to the project,
without formal bidding under existing state law, including, without limitation,
demolishing the homes in the Windsor Park neighborhood for the purposes of
creating the public park required under the Act; and (14) authorizes that entity to
retain or reuse existing infrastructure rather than demolish such infrastructure under
certain circumstances.
Section 4 of this bill removes the requirement for the Housing Division to pay
moving expenses and restitution to owners of single-family residences in the
Windsor Park neighborhood from certain Community Development Block Grant
funds transferred to the Housing Division and, instead, requires relocation expenses
to be paid from money available for the purposes of the Act and Community
Development Block Grant funds to be used only for purposes for which federal law
authorizes the use of such funds.
Section 6 of this bill appropriates $25,000,000 from the State General Fund to
the Housing Division for the purposes of the Act.

this section. The lien filed pursuant to subsection 10 expires
5 years after the [single-family residence is acquired, except
that such a single-family residence may be transferred in a
transaction that is exempt from the taxes imposed by chapter
375 of NRS pursuant to NRS 375.090.

-
36th Special Session (2025)

– 9 –
pursuant to NRS 361.225 and 361.227, on the date on which
that single-family residence was acquired, and the taxes
levied on the single-family residence in the Windsor Park
neighborhood that was exchanged, as determined pursuant
to NRS 361.225 and 361.227, for the fiscal year in which
the single-family residence in the Windsor Park
neighborhood was exchanged. The provisions of NRS
361.4722, 361.4723 and 361.4724 apply to the calculation of
the taxes on the single-family residence levied on the single-
family residence acquired pursuant to subsection 7.

Park Environmental Justice Act, and because it is the intent
of the Legislature that the single-family residences and
vacant lots in the Windsor Park neighborhood that are
exchanged pursuant to this section be demolished and
replaced by a park pursuant to subsection 16, an owner of a
single-family residence or vacant lot in the Windsor Park
neighborhood who is voluntarily exchanging the single-
family residence or vacant lot for a new single-family
residence or vacant lot under the provisions of this section
is making such an exchange because of the destruction, in
whole or in part, of the single-family residence or vacant lot
as a result of the conditions described in section 2 of the
Windsor Park Environmental Justice Act or under threat of
-
36th Special Session (2025)

the requisition or condemnation of the property for the
purposes of 26 U.S.C. § 1033.
16. Any property in the Windsor Park neighborhood that
is exchanged pursuant to this section must be used only for
the purposes of a public park to memorialize the past and
present residents of the Windsor Park neighborhood [.] ,
which must be available for use, without charge, to schools
and churches that serve the Windsor Park neighborhood.
For the purposes of creating the public park, the entity
selected by the Housing Division pursuant to subsection 3 to
develop single-family residences must be engaged under an
agreement with the Housing Division, which may act as
custodian of the land on which the park is to be constructed
and may consult with entities that applied for or received
any grants of money to construct City View Park in the
Windsor Park neighborhood. The agreement must be
separate from any agreement entered into pursuant to
subsection 6, for any additional work necessary to develop
and construct the public park, including, without limitation,
the demolition of any residences transferred pursuant to
this section and, if necessary to construct a park pursuant to
this subsection, the acquisition of any parcel of land owned
by a private party on which a residence is located that has
not been transferred pursuant to this section. Any
agreement for the demolition of the residences pursuant to
this subsection is exempt from the provisions of state law
governing the award of a contract by governmental entities,
and any payments pursuant to such an agreement,
including, without limitation, any payments to acquire any
parcel of land owned by a private party on which a
residence is located that has not been transferred pursuant
to this section, must be paid entirely from money
appropriated by the Legislature for that purpose. The
agreement may authorize the retention or reuse of existing

Subject to such safeguards as the Housing Division deems
appropriate to ensure that the objective of the payment is
accomplished, relocation expenses may be paid in advance
directly to the owner or tenant incurring the expenses or to
the vendor, based on documentation, including, without
limitation, quotes, establishing the actual amount of the
expenses. To the extent that money [transferred] available to
the Housing Division [pursuant to subsection 2 is] to carry

4. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, for
the purposes of this section, relocation expenses may
include, without limitation, packing, movers, insurance,
storage up to 90 days, utility deposits and transfers,
reconnection fees, household appliances not included in the
development, furniture replacement, fixtures, solar panel
reinstallation, temporary lodging up to 30 days and
transportation for tenant households only. Any expenses for

sections 1 to 5, inclusive, of this act.
2. Any remaining balance of the appropriation made by
subsection 1 must not be committed for expenditure after June 30,
2028, by the entity to which the appropriation is made or any entity
to which money from the appropriation is granted or otherwise
transferred in any manner, and any portion of the appropriated
money remaining must not be spent for any purpose after
September 15, 2028, by either the entity to which the money was
appropriated or the entity to which the money was subsequently
