16 purposes of determining the owners of single-family residences or vacant lots who are eligible
17 to participate in the program.
18 Section 3 of this bill: (1) requires that, to be eligible to participate in the program, an
19 owner of a single-family residence or vacant lot in the Windsor Park neighborhood must have
20 owned that single-family residence or lot on [December 31, 2023,] August 1, 2025, rather
21 than July 1, 2023; (2) authorizes a person who is the owner of a vacant lot in the Windsor Park
22 neighborhood and who was the owner, or is the descendant of the former owner, of a single-
23 family residence that was formerly located on that vacant lot in the Windsor Park
24 neighborhood to participate in the program by exchanging the vacant lot for another vacant lot

26 a person who resides in the Windsor Park neighborhood to establish that he or she is the
27 owner of a single-family residence or a vacant lot in the Windsor Park neighborhood, and,

45 vacant lot under the Act to be an escrow process with the issuance of certain title insurance
46 and provides for the payment of certain fees and charges associated with such a transaction;
47 [(11)] (12) expresses the intent of the Legislature that because of the circumstances existing in
48 the Windsor Park neighborhood, for the purposes of federal income taxation, the exchange of

50 as a result of the destruction, in whole or in part, of the single-family residence or vacant lot a
51 threatened requisition or condemnation; [(12)] (13) requires the entity selected to develop and
52 construct a single-family residence pursuant to the Act [to be engaged] to perform certain

55 the purposes of creating the public park required under the Act; and [(13)] (14) authorizes that
56 entity to retain or reuse existing infrastructure rather than demolish such infrastructure under
57 certain circumstances.
58 Section 4 of this bill removes the requirement for the Housing Division to pay moving
59 expenses and restitution to owners of single-family residences in the Windsor Park
60 neighborhood from certain Community Development Block Grant funds transferred to the
61 Housing Division and, instead, [authorizes those] requires relocation expenses to be paid

64 owners and tenants.] only for purposes for which federal law authorizes the use of such
