Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law contains the Windsor Park Environmental Justice Act, which
2 establishes a program for the relocation of persons residing in the Windsor Park
3 neighborhood of the City of North Las Vegas whose residences have been damaged
4 by the sinking of the ground beneath the residences. (Chapter 531, Statutes of
5 Nevada 2023, at page 3538) Under the Act, the Housing Division of the
6 Department of Business and Industry is required to establish and administer a
7 program by which the owner of a single-family residence in the Windsor Park
8 neighborhood who owns the residence on July 1, 2023, may exchange the residence
9 in the Windsor Park neighborhood for a new residence constructed in accordance
10 with the Act. (Section 9 of chapter 531, Statutes of Nevada 2023, at page 3540)
11 This bill makes revisions to the Act.
12 Section 1 of this bill requires the Housing Division to: (1) adopt regulations to
13 carry out the provisions of the Act, including, without limitation, regulations
14 governing certain specific topics; and (2) provide quarterly reports to the Interim
15 Finance Committee concerning the implementation of the provisions of the Act.
16 Section 2 of this bill clarifies the boundaries of the Windsor Park neighborhood
17 for the purposes of determining the owners of single-family residences or vacant
18 lots who are eligible to participate in the program.
19 Section 3 of this bill: (1) requires that, to be eligible to participate in the
20 program, an owner of a single-family residence or vacant lot in the Windsor Park
21 neighborhood must have owned that single-family residence or lot on August 1,
22 2025, rather than July 1, 2023; (2) authorizes a person who is the owner of a vacant
23 lot in the Windsor Park neighborhood and who was the owner, or is the descendant
24 of the former owner, of a single-family residence that was formerly located on that
25 vacant lot in the Windsor Park neighborhood to participate in the program by
26 exchanging the vacant lot for another vacant lot in an area as near as reasonably
27 practicable to the Windsor Park neighborhood; (3) authorizes a person who resides
28 in the Windsor Park neighborhood to establish that he or she is the owner of a
29 single-family residence or a vacant lot in the Windsor Park neighborhood, and,
30 thus, is eligible to participate in the program, by executing an affidavit, under
31 penalty of perjury, or presenting certain other documentation to establish
32 inheritance or ownership of the property; (4) establishes that the number of new
33 single-family residences to be constructed must be based on an eligibility list
34 verified by the Housing Division; (5) authorizes assistance to pay off, discharge or
35 transfer liens that prevent an exchange under the Act; (6) provides that until July 1,
36 2057, a single-family residence acquired pursuant to the Act is entitled to an
37 abatement of a certain amount of property taxes levied on the single-family
38 residence; (7) provides an exemption from taxes on the transfer of real property for
39 certain transfers of a single-family residence pursuant to the Act; (8) requires the
40 Housing Division to file a lien on the single-family residence acquired pursuant to
41 the Act to secure repayment of certain amounts if the new residence is sold within 5
42 years after the filing of the lien; (9) authorizes a mortgage on a single-family
43 residence in the Windsor Park neighborhood to be transferred to the new residence
44 acquired under the Act; (10) limits the amount of any assistance provided to pay off
45 a mortgage on a single-family residence in the Windsor Park neighborhood to the
46 payoff amount on May 25, 2025, unless certain circumstances exist authorizing an
47 additional amount to be paid off; (11) authorizes the closing of the transaction for
48 the exchange of a single-family residence or vacant lot under the Act to be an
49 escrow process with the issuance of certain title insurance and provides for the
50 payment of certain fees and charges associated with such a transaction; (12)
51 expresses the intent of the Legislature that because of the circumstances existing in
52 the Windsor Park neighborhood, for the purposes of federal income taxation, the
53 exchange of a single-family residence or vacant lot under the Act be considered an
54 involuntary exchange as a result of the destruction, in whole or in part, of the
-

– 3 –
55 single-family residence or vacant lot a threatened requisition or condemnation; (13)
56 requires the entity selected to develop and construct a single-family residence
57 pursuant to the Act to perform certain additional work related to the project,
58 without formal bidding under existing state law, including, without limitation,
59 demolishing the homes in the Windsor Park neighborhood for the purposes of
60 creating the public park required under the Act; and (14) authorizes that entity to
61 retain or reuse existing infrastructure rather than demolish such infrastructure under
62 certain circumstances.
63 Section 4 of this bill removes the requirement for the Housing Division to pay
64 moving expenses and restitution to owners of single-family residences in the
65 Windsor Park neighborhood from certain Community Development Block Grant
66 funds transferred to the Housing Division and, instead, requires relocation expenses
67 to be paid from money available for the purposes of the Act and Community
68 Development Block Grant funds to be used only for purposes for which federal law
69 authorizes the use of such funds.
70 Section 6 of this bill appropriates $25,000,000 from the State General Fund to
71 the Housing Division for the purposes of the Act.

1 (b) Pay restitution in the amount of $10,000 to the person
2 who was the initial occupant of a single-family residence in
3 the Windsor Park neighborhood, or to the descendants of that
4 person who inherited the single-family residence from the
5 initial occupant.
6 (c) Pay] pay the actual [moving] relocation expenses in
7 an amount not to exceed $50,000 of a person who owns a
8 single-family residence in the Windsor Park neighborhood
9 on August 1, 2025, who acquires a single-family residence
10 pursuant to section 9 of [this act] the Windsor Park
11 Environmental Justice Act and who moves from the
12 Windsor Park neighborhood to that acquired single-family
13 residence.
14 [4. From the amount transferred to the Housing Division
15 pursuant to paragraph (c) of subsection 2, the Housing
16 Division shall pay, in an amount not to exceed $10,000 per
17 single-family residence, the cost of rehabilitating a single-
18 family residence constructed for a resident of the Windsor
19 Park neighborhood using money received by the City from a
20 Community Development Block Grant. The governmental
21 entity, nonprofit corporation or other entity selected by the
22 Housing Division pursuant to subsection 2 of section 9 of this
23 act shall inspect the single-family residence to determine
24 whether or not the rehabilitation has been satisfactorily
25 completed.
26 5.] Such relocation expenses may be paid to a person
27 who was the tenant of an owner of a single-family residence
28 in the Windsor Park neighborhood on August 1, 2025, and
29 who is required to move residences as a result of the
30 program established pursuant to section 9 of this act.
31 Subject to such safeguards as the Housing Division deems
32 appropriate to ensure that the objective of the payment is
33 accomplished, relocation expenses may be paid in advance
34 directly to the owner or tenant incurring the expenses or to
35 the vendor, based on documentation, including, without
36 limitation, quotes, establishing the actual amount of the
37 expenses. To the extent that money [transferred] available to
38 the Housing Division [pursuant to subsection 2 is] to carry
39 out the provisions of the Windsor Park Environmental
40 Justice Act is insufficient to make the entire amount of the
41 payments required by this subsection , [3 or 4,] the Housing
42 Division shall reduce such payments on a pro rata basis.
43 4. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, for
44 the purposes of this section, relocation expenses may
45 include, without limitation, packing, movers, insurance,

10 Sec. 5. (Deleted by amendment.)
11 Sec. 6. 1. There is hereby appropriated from the State
12 General Fund to the Housing Division of the Department of

15 531, Statutes of Nevada 2023, at page 3538, and the provisions of
16 sections 1 to 5, inclusive, of this act.

18 subsection 1 must not be committed for expenditure after June 30,
19 2028, by the entity to which the appropriation is made or any entity
20 to which money from the appropriation is granted or otherwise
21 transferred in any manner, and any portion of the appropriated
22 money remaining must not be spent for any purpose after
23 September 15, 2028, by either the entity to which the money was
24 appropriated or the entity to which the money was subsequently
25 granted or transferred, and must be reverted to the State General
26 Fund on or before September 15, 2028.
