Section 1:
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to occupational diseases; revising provisions
governing the circumstances when diseases of the lungs are
considered to be an occupational disease for certain police
officers, firefighters or arson investigators; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law provides for the payment of compensation for temporary or
permanent disability or death for diseases of the lungs caused by exposure to heat,
smoke, fumes, tear gas or any other noxious gases, arising out of and in the course
of employment for certain firefighters, arson investigators and police officers.
Existing law also provides that a disease of the lungs is conclusively presumed to
have arisen out of and in the course of employment for firefighters, arson
investigators and police officers who have been employed in such a full-time
continuous, uninterrupted and salaried occupation for 2 or more years before the
date of disablement under certain circumstances. (NRS 617.455) Section 1 of this
bill provides that this conclusive presumption for such firefighters, arson
investigators and police officers is not conditioned on whether the disease of the
lungs was caused by exposure to heat, smoke, fumes, tear gas or any other noxious
gas. Section 2 of this bill provides that this conclusive presumption for such
firefighters, arson investigators and police officers applies retroactively to claims
filed on or before the effective date of this bill.
