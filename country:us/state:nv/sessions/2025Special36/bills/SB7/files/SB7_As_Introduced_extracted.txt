EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to occupational diseases; revising provisions
governing the circumstances when diseases of the lungs
are considered to be an occupational disease for certain
police officers, firefighters or arson investigators; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the payment of compensation for temporary or
2 permanent disability or death for diseases of the lungs caused by exposure to heat,
3 smoke, fumes, tear gas or any other noxious gases, arising out of and in the course
4 of employment for certain firefighters, arson investigators and police officers.
5 Existing law also provides that a disease of the lungs is conclusively presumed to
6 have arisen out of and in the course of employment for firefighters, arson
7 investigators and police officers who have been employed in such a full-time
8 continuous, uninterrupted and salaried occupation for 2 or more years before the
9 date of disablement under certain circumstances. (NRS 617.455) Section 1 of this
10 bill provides that this conclusive presumption for such firefighters, arson
11 investigators and police officers is not conditioned on whether the disease of the
12 lungs was caused by exposure to heat, smoke, fumes, tear gas or any other noxious
13 gas. Section 2 of this bill provides that this conclusive presumption for such
14 firefighters, arson investigators and police officers applies retroactively to claims
15 filed on or before the effective date of this bill.

13 party administrator, as applicable, to pay to the claimant a benefit
