investors; requiring, with certain exceptions, certain corporate
investors in residential real property in this State to register with the
Securities Division of the Office of the Secretary of State [each time]
before purchasing a unit of residential real property; requiring the
Securities Division to create and maintain a database that tracks
the aggregate number of units of residential real property

actions; requiring the Secretary of State to establish requirements for
the form and contents of an instrument that creates a life estate;
prohibiting a county recorder from recording certain deeds and

properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Section 1.5 of this bill declares that: (1) the State has certain compelling interests
2 related to attainable housing, stabilizing neighborhoods and supporting certain housing
3 programs; (2) ensuring a fair and competitive housing market is necessary to support
4 certain public interests; (3) preserving the stability and character of the State’s
5 communities is essential; and (4) reducing speculative investment in residential real
6 estate by certain buyers is necessary to further certain public interests.
7 Section 2 of this bill provides, with certain exceptions, that: (1) the total aggregate
8 number of units of residential real property in this State that may be purchased in any 1
9 calendar year by corporations, foreign corporations, multinational corporations, pooled
10 investment vehicles, limited-liability companies and any affiliates of such entities must not
11 exceed [100] 1,000 units; and (2) a corporation, foreign corporation, multinational
12 corporation, pooled investment vehicle, limited-liability company or affiliate of such an

Senate Amendment No. 32 to Senate Bill No. 10 Page 4
13 entity is prohibited from purchasing any unit of residential real property in this State if, as a
14 result of the purchase, the total aggregate number of units of residential real property
15 purchased in this State during the current calendar year by any corporations, foreign
16 corporations, multinational corporations, pooled investment vehicles, limited-liability
17 companies and affiliates of such entities would exceed [100] 1,000 units.
18 Section 2 also requires the Securities Division of the Office of the Secretary of State to
19 create and maintain : (1) a registry of corporations, foreign corporations, multinational
20 corporations, pooled investment vehicles, limited-liability companies and any affiliates of
21 such entities that purchase or own residential real property in this State [.] and; (2) a
22 database that tracks the aggregate number of units of residential real property
23 purchased annually by corporations, foreign corporations, multinational corporations,
24 pooled investment vehicles, limited-liability companies and any affiliates of such entities.
25 Section 2 requires, with certain exceptions, a corporation, foreign corporation,
26 multinational corporation, pooled investment vehicle, limited-liability company or any
27 affiliate of such an entity to register with the Securities Division [each time] before the entity
28 purchases any unit of residential real property in this State. Section 2 exempts from that
29 requirement a corporation, foreign corporation, multinational corporation, pooled
30 investment vehicle, limited-liability company or affiliate of such an entity that owns fewer
31 than [10] 15 units of residential real property in this State. Section 2 further requires each
32 corporation, foreign corporation, multinational corporation, pooled investment vehicle,
33 limited-liability company or affiliate of such an entity to report to the Secretary of State
34 certain information related to each purchase of a unit of residential real property in this
35 State within 10 business days after the completion of such a purchase. Section 2: (1)
36 requires the Secretary of State to immediately update the database that tracks the
37 aggregate number of units of residential real property purchased annually and reduce
38 the available annual allotment; (2) requires the Secretary of State to provide certain
39 periodic reports to each county recorder or his or her designee related to such purchases
40 to ensure compliance with certain provisions related to deeds; (3) authorizes the Secretary
41 of State to [charge a fee to each such corporation, limited-liability company or affiliate of such
42 an entity;] establish certain reasonable fees; and [(2)] (4) requires the Secretary of State to
43 adopt regulations necessary to carry out the provisions of section 2. For the purposes of
44 section 2, the term “corporation” does not include a family trust company or a housing
45 authority.
46 Section 2.5 of this bill provides that: (1) any purchase of a unit of residential real
47 property that violates section 2 is void; and (2) if a deed for a transaction that violates
48 section 2 is recorded, the deed is subject to nullification. Section 2.5 authorizes: (1) the
49 Secretary of State to investigate any potential violations of section 2 and disclose certain
50 information to the Attorney General; and (2) the Attorney General to initiate legal
51 proceedings to enforce the provisions of section 2.5. Section 3 of this bill authorizes the
52 Attorney General, upon the request of the Secretary of State, to bring an action against an
53 entity that violates or proposes to violate the provisions of section 2 to obtain an injunction or
54 other equitable relief appropriate to ensure compliance with or enforce the provisions of
55 section 2.
56 Existing law sets forth the requirements for recording certain documents that relate to real
57 property. (NRS 111.312) Section 5 of this bill prohibits a county recorder from filing a deed
58 for a unit of residential real property purchased by a corporation, foreign corporation,
59 multinational corporation, pooled investment vehicle, limited-liability company or affiliate
60 of such an entity unless the entity submits to the county recorder for recording, concurrently
61 with the deed to be recorded, a copy of the certificate of registration for that purchase issued
62 by the Secretary of State pursuant to section 2. Section 5 requires a county recorder to
63 provide to the Secretary of State upon request certain information relating to the requirement
64 imposed by section 2.
65 Section 4 of this bill requires the Secretary of State to adopt regulations establishing
66 requirements for the form and contents of any instrument that creates a life estate. Section 5
67 prohibits a county recorder from recording a document that is such an instrument unless the
68 document complies with those requirements. Section 5.5 of this bill provides that the
69 provisions of this act do not apply to the purchase of a unit of residential real property
70 completed on or before July 1, 2026.
