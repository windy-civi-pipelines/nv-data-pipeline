AN ACT relating to real property; limiting, with certain exceptions, the total
aggregate number of units of residential real property in this State that
may be purchased in any 1 calendar year by certain corporate
investors; requiring, with certain exceptions, certain corporate
investors in residential real property in this State to register with the
Securities Division of the Office of the Secretary of State before
purchasing a unit of residential real property; requiring the Securities
Division to create and maintain a database that tracks the aggregate
number of units of residential real property purchased by certain
corporate investors; requiring certain corporate investors to report to
the Secretary of State certain information concerning each purchase of
a unit of residential real property; providing that certain purchases of
residential real property are void; authorizing the Attorney General to
bring certain actions; requiring the Secretary of State to establish
requirements for the form and contents of an instrument that creates a
life estate; prohibiting a county recorder from recording certain deeds
and documents under certain circumstances; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Section 1.5 of this bill declares that: (1) the State has certain compelling interests related
2 to attainable housing, stabilizing neighborhoods and supporting certain housing programs; (2)
3 ensuring a fair and competitive housing market is necessary to support certain public interests;
4 (3) preserving the stability and character of the State’s communities is essential; and (4)
5 reducing speculative investment in residential real estate by certain buyers is necessary to
6 further certain public interests.
7 Section 2 of this bill provides, with certain exceptions, that: (1) the total aggregate
8 number of units of residential real property in this State that may be purchased in any 1
9 calendar year by corporations, foreign corporations, multinational corporations, pooled
10 investment vehicles, limited-liability companies and any affiliates of such entities must not
11 exceed 1,000 units; and (2) a corporation, foreign corporation, multinational corporation,
12 pooled investment vehicle, limited-liability company or affiliate of such an entity is prohibited
13 from purchasing any unit of residential real property in this State if, as a result of the
14 purchase, the total aggregate number of units of residential real property purchased in this
Assembly Amendment No. 35 to Senate Bill No. 10 First Reprint Page 4
15 State during the current calendar year by any corporations, foreign corporations, multinational
16 corporations, pooled investment vehicles, limited-liability companies and affiliates of such
17 entities would exceed 1,000 units.
18 Section 2 also requires the Securities Division of the Office of the Secretary of State to
19 create and maintain: (1) a registry of corporations, foreign corporations, multinational
20 corporations, pooled investment vehicles, limited-liability companies and any affiliates of
21 such entities that purchase or own residential real property in this State and; (2) a database that
22 tracks the aggregate number of units of residential real property purchased annually by
23 corporations, foreign corporations, multinational corporations, pooled investment vehicles,
24 limited-liability companies and any affiliates of such entities. Section 2 requires, with certain
25 exceptions, a corporation, foreign corporation, multinational corporation, pooled investment
26 vehicle, limited-liability company or any affiliate of such an entity to register with the
27 Securities Division before the entity purchases any unit of residential real property in this
28 State. Section 2 exempts from that requirement a corporation, foreign corporation,
29 multinational corporation, pooled investment vehicle, limited-liability company or affiliate of
30 such an entity that owns fewer than 15 units of residential real property in this State. Section 2
31 further requires each corporation, foreign corporation, multinational corporation, pooled
32 investment vehicle, limited-liability company or affiliate of such an entity to report to the
33 Secretary of State certain information related to each purchase of a unit of residential real
34 property in this State within 10 business days after the completion of such a purchase. Section
35 2: (1) requires the Secretary of State to immediately update the database that tracks the
36 aggregate number of units of residential real property purchased annually and reduce the
37 available annual allotment; (2) requires the Secretary of State to provide certain periodic
38 reports to each county recorder or his or her designee related to such purchases to ensure
39 compliance with certain provisions related to deeds; (3) authorizes the Secretary of State to
40 establish certain reasonable fees; and (4) requires the Secretary of State to adopt regulations
41 necessary to carry out the provisions of section 2. For the purposes of section 2, the term
42 “corporation” does not include a family trust company or a housing authority.
43 Section 2.5 of this bill provides that: (1) any purchase of a unit of residential real property
44 that violates section 2 is void; and (2) if a deed for a transaction that violates section 2 is
45 recorded, the deed is subject to nullification. Section 2.5 authorizes: (1) the Secretary of State
46 to investigate any potential violations of section 2 and disclose certain information to the
47 Attorney General; and (2) the Attorney General to initiate legal proceedings to enforce the
48 provisions of section 2.5. Section 3 of this bill authorizes the Attorney General, upon the
49 request of the Secretary of State, to bring an action against an entity that violates or proposes
50 to violate the provisions of section 2 to obtain an injunction or other equitable relief
51 appropriate to ensure compliance with or enforce the provisions of section 2.
52 Existing law sets forth the requirements for recording certain documents that relate to real
53 property. (NRS 111.312) Section 5 of this bill prohibits a county recorder from filing a deed
54 for a unit of residential real property purchased by a corporation, foreign corporation,
55 multinational corporation, pooled investment vehicle, limited-liability company or affiliate of
56 such an entity unless the entity submits to the county recorder for recording, concurrently with
57 the deed to be recorded, a copy of the certificate of registration for that purchase issued by the
58 Secretary of State pursuant to section 2. Section 5 requires a county recorder to provide to the
59 Secretary of State upon request certain information relating to the requirement imposed by
60 section 2.
61 Section 4 of this bill requires the Secretary of State to adopt regulations establishing
62 requirements for the form and contents of any instrument that creates a life estate. Section 5
63 prohibits a county recorder from recording a document that is such an instrument unless the
64 document complies with those requirements. Section 5.5 of this bill provides that the
65 provisions of this act do not apply to the purchase of a unit of residential real property
66 completed on or before [July 1, 2026.] January 1, 2027.

AN ACT relating to real property; limiting, with certain exceptions, the total
aggregate number of units of residential real property in this State that
may be purchased in any 1 calendar year by certain corporate
investors; requiring, with certain exceptions, certain corporate
investors in residential real property in this State to register with the
Securities Division of the Office of the Secretary of State before
purchasing a unit of residential real property; requiring the Securities
Division to create and maintain a database that tracks the aggregate
number of units of residential real property purchased by certain
corporate investors; requiring certain corporate investors to report to
the Secretary of State certain information concerning each purchase of
a unit of residential real property; providing that certain purchases of
residential real property are void; authorizing the Attorney General to
bring certain actions; requiring the Secretary of State to establish
requirements for the form and contents of an instrument that creates a
life estate; prohibiting a county recorder from recording certain deeds
and documents under certain circumstances; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Section 1.5 of this bill declares that: (1) the State has certain compelling interests related
2 to attainable housing, stabilizing neighborhoods and supporting certain housing programs; (2)
3 ensuring a fair and competitive housing market is necessary to support certain public interests;
4 (3) preserving the stability and character of the State’s communities is essential; and (4)
5 reducing speculative investment in residential real estate by certain buyers is necessary to
6 further certain public interests.
7 Section 2 of this bill provides, with certain exceptions, that: (1) the total aggregate
8 number of units of residential real property in this State that may be purchased in any 1
9 calendar year by corporations, foreign corporations, multinational corporations, pooled
10 investment vehicles, limited-liability companies and any affiliates of such entities must not
11 exceed 1,000 units; and (2) a corporation, foreign corporation, multinational corporation,
12 pooled investment vehicle, limited-liability company or affiliate of such an entity is prohibited
13 from purchasing any unit of residential real property in this State if, as a result of the
14 purchase, the total aggregate number of units of residential real property purchased in this

Assembly Amendment No. 35 to Senate Bill No. 10 First Reprint Page 4
15 State during the current calendar year by any corporations, foreign corporations, multinational
16 corporations, pooled investment vehicles, limited-liability companies and affiliates of such
17 entities would exceed 1,000 units.
18 Section 2 also requires the Securities Division of the Office of the Secretary of State to
19 create and maintain: (1) a registry of corporations, foreign corporations, multinational
20 corporations, pooled investment vehicles, limited-liability companies and any affiliates of
21 such entities that purchase or own residential real property in this State and; (2) a database that
22 tracks the aggregate number of units of residential real property purchased annually by
23 corporations, foreign corporations, multinational corporations, pooled investment vehicles,
24 limited-liability companies and any affiliates of such entities. Section 2 requires, with certain
25 exceptions, a corporation, foreign corporation, multinational corporation, pooled investment
26 vehicle, limited-liability company or any affiliate of such an entity to register with the
27 Securities Division before the entity purchases any unit of residential real property in this
28 State. Section 2 exempts from that requirement a corporation, foreign corporation,
29 multinational corporation, pooled investment vehicle, limited-liability company or affiliate of
30 such an entity that owns fewer than 15 units of residential real property in this State. Section 2
31 further requires each corporation, foreign corporation, multinational corporation, pooled
32 investment vehicle, limited-liability company or affiliate of such an entity to report to the
33 Secretary of State certain information related to each purchase of a unit of residential real
34 property in this State within 10 business days after the completion of such a purchase. Section
35 2: (1) requires the Secretary of State to immediately update the database that tracks the
36 aggregate number of units of residential real property purchased annually and reduce the
37 available annual allotment; (2) requires the Secretary of State to provide certain periodic
38 reports to each county recorder or his or her designee related to such purchases to ensure
39 compliance with certain provisions related to deeds; (3) authorizes the Secretary of State to
40 establish certain reasonable fees; and (4) requires the Secretary of State to adopt regulations
41 necessary to carry out the provisions of section 2. For the purposes of section 2, the term
42 “corporation” does not include a family trust company or a housing authority.
43 Section 2.5 of this bill provides that: (1) any purchase of a unit of residential real property
44 that violates section 2 is void; and (2) if a deed for a transaction that violates section 2 is
45 recorded, the deed is subject to nullification. Section 2.5 authorizes: (1) the Secretary of State
46 to investigate any potential violations of section 2 and disclose certain information to the
47 Attorney General; and (2) the Attorney General to initiate legal proceedings to enforce the
48 provisions of section 2.5. Section 3 of this bill authorizes the Attorney General, upon the
49 request of the Secretary of State, to bring an action against an entity that violates or proposes
50 to violate the provisions of section 2 to obtain an injunction or other equitable relief
51 appropriate to ensure compliance with or enforce the provisions of section 2.
52 Existing law sets forth the requirements for recording certain documents that relate to real
53 property. (NRS 111.312) Section 5 of this bill prohibits a county recorder from filing a deed
54 for a unit of residential real property purchased by a corporation, foreign corporation,
55 multinational corporation, pooled investment vehicle, limited-liability company or affiliate of
56 such an entity unless the entity submits to the county recorder for recording, concurrently with
57 the deed to be recorded, a copy of the certificate of registration for that purchase issued by the
58 Secretary of State pursuant to section 2. Section 5 requires a county recorder to provide to the
59 Secretary of State upon request certain information relating to the requirement imposed by
60 section 2.
61 Section 4 of this bill requires the Secretary of State to adopt regulations establishing
62 requirements for the form and contents of any instrument that creates a life estate. Section 5
63 prohibits a county recorder from recording a document that is such an instrument unless the
64 document complies with those requirements. Section 5.5 of this bill provides that the
65 provisions of this act do not apply to the purchase of a unit of residential real property
66 completed on or before [July 1, 2026.] January 1, 2027.
