6 investment in residential real estate by certain buyers is necessary to further certain
7 public interests.
8 Section 2 of this bill provides, with certain exceptions, that: (1) the total
9 aggregate number of units of residential real property in this State that may be
10 purchased in any 1 calendar year by corporations, foreign corporations,
11 multinational corporations, pooled investment vehicles, limited-liability companies
12 and any affiliates of such entities must not exceed 1,000 units; and (2) a
13 corporation, foreign corporation, multinational corporation, pooled investment
14 vehicle, limited-liability company or affiliate of such an entity is prohibited from

17 in this State during the current calendar year by any corporations, foreign
18 corporations, multinational corporations, pooled investment vehicles, limited-
19 liability companies and affiliates of such entities would exceed 1,000 units.
20 Section 2 also requires the Securities Division of the Office of the Secretary of
21 State to create and maintain: (1) a registry of corporations, foreign corporations,
22 multinational corporations, pooled investment vehicles, limited-liability companies
23 and any affiliates of such entities that purchase or own residential real property in
24 this State and; (2) a database that tracks the aggregate number of units of residential
25 real property purchased annually by corporations, foreign corporations,

27 and any affiliates of such entities. Section 2 requires, with certain exceptions, a
28 corporation, foreign corporation, multinational corporation, pooled investment
29 vehicle, limited-liability company or any affiliate of such an entity to register with
30 the Securities Division before the entity purchases any unit of residential real

32 foreign corporation, multinational corporation, pooled investment vehicle, limited-
33 liability company or affiliate of such an entity that owns fewer than 15 units of
34 residential real property in this State. Section 2 further requires each corporation,
35 foreign corporation, multinational corporation, pooled investment vehicle, limited-
36 liability company or affiliate of such an entity to report to the Secretary of State
37 certain information related to each purchase of a unit of residential real property in

44 authorizes the Secretary of State to establish certain reasonable fees; and (4)
45 requires the Secretary of State to adopt regulations necessary to carry out the
46 provisions of section 2. For the purposes of section 2, the term “corporation” does
47 not include a family trust company or a housing authority.
48 Section 2.5 of this bill provides that: (1) any purchase of a unit of residential
49 real property that violates section 2 is void; and (2) if a deed for a transaction that
50 violates section 2 is recorded, the deed is subject to nullification. Section 2.5
51 authorizes: (1) the Secretary of State to investigate any potential violations of
52 section 2 and disclose certain information to the Attorney General; and (2) the
53 Attorney General to initiate legal proceedings to enforce the provisions of section
54 2.5. Section 3 of this bill authorizes the Attorney General, upon the request of the
55 Secretary of State, to bring an action against an entity that violates or proposes to
56 violate the provisions of section 2 to obtain an injunction or other equitable relief
57 appropriate to ensure compliance with or enforce the provisions of section 2.
58 Existing law sets forth the requirements for recording certain documents that
59 relate to real property. (NRS 111.312) Section 5 of this bill prohibits a county
60 recorder from filing a deed for a unit of residential real property purchased by a
-
*SB10_R1*

– 3 –
61 corporation, foreign corporation, multinational corporation, pooled investment
62 vehicle, limited-liability company or affiliate of such an entity unless the entity

64 recorded, a copy of the certificate of registration for that purchase issued by the
65 Secretary of State pursuant to section 2. Section 5 requires a county recorder to
66 provide to the Secretary of State upon request certain information relating to the
67 requirement imposed by section 2.
68 Section 4 of this bill requires the Secretary of State to adopt regulations
69 establishing requirements for the form and contents of any instrument that creates a
70 life estate. Section 5 prohibits a county recorder from recording a document that is
71 such an instrument unless the document complies with those requirements. Section
72 5.5 of this bill provides that the provisions of this act do not apply to the purchase
73 of a unit of residential real property completed on or before July 1, 2026.
