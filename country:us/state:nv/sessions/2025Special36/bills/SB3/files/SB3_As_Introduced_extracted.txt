AN ACT relating to public assistance; establishing the Silver State
General Assistance Program within the Division of Social
Services of the Department of Human Services; setting
forth the powers and duties of the Administrator of the
Division relating to the Program; creating the Account for
the Silver State General Assistance Program; authorizing
a transfer to that Account from the unrestricted balance of
the State General Fund under certain circumstances;
making appropriations; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Division of Social Services of the Department of
2 Human Services to administer various programs of public assistance. (Chapter
3 422A of NRS) Sections 2-9 of this bill establish the Silver State General Assistance
4 Program within the Division to provide temporary financial or in-kind assistance to
5 eligible persons and households who are experiencing an extraordinary
6 circumstance. Section 3 defines “extraordinary circumstance” as an event,
7 condition or situation that creates an unusual or significant need for State
8 intervention to protect the health, safety or general welfare of the residents of this
9 State, including a disruption in the provision of, suspension of or any related
10 reduction in benefits provided under a program of public assistance. Section 6
11 requires the Administrator of the Division to administer the Program within the
12 limitations of available money.
13 Section 7 prescribes requirements relating to eligibility for assistance under the
14 Program and requires the adoption of regulations for the administration of the
15 Program. Under existing law, the adoption of such regulations is exempt from
16 the Nevada Administrative Procedure Act. (NRS 233B.039) However, the
-
*SB3*
– 2 –
17 Administrator is required to comply with a procedure set forth in existing law for
18 adopting regulations for programs administered by the Division, which includes 30
19 days’ notice of the intended adoption. (NRS 422A.190) Sections 7 and 13 of this
20 bill exempt the Administrator from this procedure when adopting regulations for
21 the administration of the Program under certain circumstances, but require such
22 advance notice of such regulations as is practicable and the posting of the notice
23 and regulations on the Internet website of the Division.
24 Section 8 sets forth certain powers of the Administrator relating to the
25 Program. Section 9 makes certain information obtained by the Division in
26 the administration of the Program confidential. Section 9 also requires the
27 Administrator to submit an annual report regarding the Program. Section 12 of this
28 bill makes a conforming change relating to the confidentiality of certain
29 information obtained during the administration of the Program.
30 Section 10 of this bill creates the Account for the Silver State General
31 Assistance Program in the State General Fund for the deposit of money received for
32 the Program. Section 11 of this bill provides a procedure for the transfer of money
33 from the unrestricted balance of the State General Fund to the Account for the
34 provision of assistance under the Program for an extraordinary circumstance if
35 there is a specified minimum balance remaining in the State General Fund after the
36 transfer and the Governor has declared the existence of the extraordinary
37 circumstance.
38 Sections 14 and 15 of this bill make appropriations from the State General
39 Fund for the provision of assistance under the Program for the periods of November
40 of 2025 and December of 2025, respectively. For purposes of such assistance,
41 sections 14 and 15 deem a person or household in this State who is enrolled in the
42 federally-funded Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for any period during
43 November of 2025 or December of 2025, respectively, to: (1) be eligible for
44 assistance under the Silver State General Assistance Program during the same
45 period; and (2) have jointly applied for and have been jointly processed and
46 approved for both programs.

S.B. 3
SENATE BILL NO. 3–SELECT COMMITTEE
ON HEALTH AND WELLNESS
PREFILED NOVEMBER 12, 2025
____________
Referred to Select Committee on Health and Wellness
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to public assistance.
(BDR 38-20)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Contains Appropriation not included
in Executive Budget.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public assistance; establishing the Silver State
General Assistance Program within the Division of Social
Services of the Department of Human Services; setting
forth the powers and duties of the Administrator of the
Division relating to the Program; creating the Account for
the Silver State General Assistance Program; authorizing
a transfer to that Account from the unrestricted balance of
the State General Fund under certain circumstances;
making appropriations; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Division of Social Services of the Department of
2 Human Services to administer various programs of public assistance. (Chapter
3 422A of NRS) Sections 2-9 of this bill establish the Silver State General Assistance
4 Program within the Division to provide temporary financial or in-kind assistance to
5 eligible persons and households who are experiencing an extraordinary
6 circumstance. Section 3 defines “extraordinary circumstance” as an event,
7 condition or situation that creates an unusual or significant need for State
8 intervention to protect the health, safety or general welfare of the residents of this
9 State, including a disruption in the provision of, suspension of or any related
10 reduction in benefits provided under a program of public assistance. Section 6
11 requires the Administrator of the Division to administer the Program within the
12 limitations of available money.
13 Section 7 prescribes requirements relating to eligibility for assistance under the
14 Program and requires the adoption of regulations for the administration of the
15 Program. Under existing law, the adoption of such regulations is exempt from
16 the Nevada Administrative Procedure Act. (NRS 233B.039) However, the
-
*SB3*

– 2 –
17 Administrator is required to comply with a procedure set forth in existing law for
18 adopting regulations for programs administered by the Division, which includes 30
19 days’ notice of the intended adoption. (NRS 422A.190) Sections 7 and 13 of this
20 bill exempt the Administrator from this procedure when adopting regulations for
21 the administration of the Program under certain circumstances, but require such
22 advance notice of such regulations as is practicable and the posting of the notice
23 and regulations on the Internet website of the Division.
24 Section 8 sets forth certain powers of the Administrator relating to the
25 Program. Section 9 makes certain information obtained by the Division in
26 the administration of the Program confidential. Section 9 also requires the
27 Administrator to submit an annual report regarding the Program. Section 12 of this
28 bill makes a conforming change relating to the confidentiality of certain
29 information obtained during the administration of the Program.
30 Section 10 of this bill creates the Account for the Silver State General
31 Assistance Program in the State General Fund for the deposit of money received for
32 the Program. Section 11 of this bill provides a procedure for the transfer of money
33 from the unrestricted balance of the State General Fund to the Account for the
34 provision of assistance under the Program for an extraordinary circumstance if
35 there is a specified minimum balance remaining in the State General Fund after the
36 transfer and the Governor has declared the existence of the extraordinary
37 circumstance.
38 Sections 14 and 15 of this bill make appropriations from the State General
39 Fund for the provision of assistance under the Program for the periods of November
40 of 2025 and December of 2025, respectively. For purposes of such assistance,
