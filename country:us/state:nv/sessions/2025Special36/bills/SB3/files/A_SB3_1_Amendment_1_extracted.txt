AN ACT relating to public assistance; establishing the Silver State General
Assistance Program within the Division of Social Services of the
Department of Human Services; setting forth the powers and duties of
the Administrator of the Division relating to the Program; creating the
Account for the Silver State General Assistance Program; authorizing a
transfer to that Account from the unrestricted balance of the State
General Fund under certain circumstances; [making appropriations;]
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Division of Social Services of the Department of Human
2 Services to administer various programs of public assistance. (Chapter 422A of NRS)
3 Sections 2-9 of this bill establish the Silver State General Assistance Program within the
4 Division to provide temporary financial or in-kind assistance to eligible persons and
5 households who are experiencing an extraordinary circumstance. Section 3 defines
6 “extraordinary circumstance” as an event, condition or situation that creates an unusual or
7 significant need for State intervention to protect the health, safety or general welfare of the
8 residents of this State, including a disruption in the provision of, suspension of or any related
9 reduction in benefits provided under a program of public assistance. Section 6 requires the
10 Administrator of the Division to administer the Program within the limitations of available
11 money.
12 Section 7 prescribes requirements relating to eligibility for assistance under the Program
13 and requires the adoption of regulations for the administration of the Program. Under existing
14 law, the adoption of such regulations is exempt from the Nevada Administrative Procedure
15 Act. (NRS 233B.039) However, the Administrator is required to comply with a procedure set
16 forth in existing law for adopting regulations for programs administered by the Division,
17 which includes 30 days’ notice of the intended adoption. (NRS 422A.190) Sections 7 and 13
18 of this bill exempt the Administrator from this procedure when adopting regulations for the
19 administration of the Program under certain circumstances, but require such advance notice of
20 such regulations as is practicable and the posting of the notice and regulations on the Internet
21 website of the Division.
22 Section 8 sets forth certain powers of the Administrator relating to the Program. Section
23 9 makes certain information obtained by the Division in the administration of the Program
24 confidential. Section 9 also requires the Administrator to submit an annual report regarding
Senate Amendment No. 1 to Senate Bill No. 3 Page 4
25 the Program. Section 12 of this bill makes a conforming change relating to the confidentiality
26 of certain information obtained during the administration of the Program.
27 Section 10 of this bill creates the Account for the Silver State General Assistance
28 Program in the State General Fund for the deposit of money received for the Program. Section
29 11 of this bill provides a procedure for the transfer of money from the unrestricted balance of
30 the State General Fund to the Account for the provision of assistance under the Program for an
31 extraordinary circumstance if there is a specified minimum balance remaining in the State
32 General Fund after the transfer and the Governor has declared the existence of the
33 extraordinary circumstance.
34 [Sections 14 and 15 of this bill make appropriations from the State General Fund for the
35 provision of assistance under the Program for the periods of November of 2025 and December
36 of 2025, respectively. For purposes of such assistance, sections 14 and 15 deem a person or
37 household in this State who is enrolled in the federally-funded Supplemental Nutrition
38 Assistance Program for any period during November of 2025 or December of 2025,
39 respectively, to: (1) be eligible for assistance under the Silver State General Assistance
40 Program during the same period; and (2) have jointly applied for and have been jointly
41 processed and approved for both programs.]

51 (a) The public record:
52 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
53 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
Senate Amendment No. 1 to Senate Bill No. 3 Page 9
1 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by means of an
2 electronic medium would:

42 5. No objection to any regulation on the ground of noncompliance with the
43 procedural requirements of this section may be made more than 2 years after its

Referred to Select Committee on Health and Wellness
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to public assistance. (BDR 38-20)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Contains Appropriation not included in
Executive Budget.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public assistance; establishing the Silver State General
Assistance Program within the Division of Social Services of the
Department of Human Services; setting forth the powers and duties of
the Administrator of the Division relating to the Program; creating the
Account for the Silver State General Assistance Program; authorizing a
transfer to that Account from the unrestricted balance of the State
General Fund under certain circumstances; [making appropriations;]
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Division of Social Services of the Department of Human
2 Services to administer various programs of public assistance. (Chapter 422A of NRS)
3 Sections 2-9 of this bill establish the Silver State General Assistance Program within the
4 Division to provide temporary financial or in-kind assistance to eligible persons and
5 households who are experiencing an extraordinary circumstance. Section 3 defines
6 “extraordinary circumstance” as an event, condition or situation that creates an unusual or
7 significant need for State intervention to protect the health, safety or general welfare of the
8 residents of this State, including a disruption in the provision of, suspension of or any related
9 reduction in benefits provided under a program of public assistance. Section 6 requires the
10 Administrator of the Division to administer the Program within the limitations of available
11 money.
12 Section 7 prescribes requirements relating to eligibility for assistance under the Program
13 and requires the adoption of regulations for the administration of the Program. Under existing
14 law, the adoption of such regulations is exempt from the Nevada Administrative Procedure
15 Act. (NRS 233B.039) However, the Administrator is required to comply with a procedure set
16 forth in existing law for adopting regulations for programs administered by the Division,
17 which includes 30 days’ notice of the intended adoption. (NRS 422A.190) Sections 7 and 13
18 of this bill exempt the Administrator from this procedure when adopting regulations for the
19 administration of the Program under certain circumstances, but require such advance notice of
20 such regulations as is practicable and the posting of the notice and regulations on the Internet
21 website of the Division.

30 copied or an abstract or memorandum may be prepared from those public books
31 and public records. Any such copies, abstracts or memoranda may be used to

37 federal law.
38 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record which is

50 electronic format or by means of an electronic medium if:
51 (a) The public record:
52 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
53 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or

Senate Amendment No. 1 to Senate Bill No. 3 Page 9
1 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by means of an
2 electronic medium would:
3 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
4 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential and that
5 cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from information that is not
6 otherwise confidential.
7 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who has legal
8 custody or control of a public record:
