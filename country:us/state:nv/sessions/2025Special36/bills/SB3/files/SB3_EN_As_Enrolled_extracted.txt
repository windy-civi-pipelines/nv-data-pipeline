CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to public assistance; establishing the Silver State
General Assistance Program within the Division of Social
Services of the Department of Human Services; setting forth
the powers and duties of the Administrator of the Division
relating to the Program; creating the Account for the Silver
State General Assistance Program; authorizing a transfer to
that Account from the unrestricted balance of the State
General Fund under certain circumstances; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law requires the Division of Social Services of the Department of
Human Services to administer various programs of public assistance. (Chapter
422A of NRS) Sections 2-9 of this bill establish the Silver State General Assistance
Program within the Division to provide temporary financial or in-kind assistance to
eligible persons and households who are experiencing an extraordinary
circumstance. Section 3 defines “extraordinary circumstance” as an event,
condition or situation that creates an unusual or significant need for State
intervention to protect the health, safety or general welfare of the residents of this
State, including a disruption in the provision of, suspension of or any related
reduction in benefits provided under a program of public assistance. Section 6
requires the Administrator of the Division to administer the Program within the
limitations of available money.

Section 2:
Section 7 prescribes requirements relating to eligibility for assistance under the
Program and requires the adoption of regulations for the administration of the
Program. Under existing law, the adoption of such regulations is exempt from
the Nevada Administrative Procedure Act. (NRS 233B.039) However, the
Administrator is required to comply with a procedure set forth in existing law for
adopting regulations for programs administered by the Division, which includes 30
days’ notice of the intended adoption. (NRS 422A.190) Sections 7 and 13 of this
bill exempt the Administrator from this procedure when adopting regulations for
the administration of the Program under certain circumstances, but require such
advance notice of such regulations as is practicable and the posting of the notice
and regulations on the Internet website of the Division.

Section 3:
Section 8 sets forth certain powers of the Administrator relating to the
Program. Section 9 makes certain information obtained by the Division in
the administration of the Program confidential. Section 9 also requires the
Administrator to submit an annual report regarding the Program. Section 12 of this
bill makes a conforming change relating to the confidentiality of certain
information obtained during the administration of the Program.

Section 4:
Section 10 of this bill creates the Account for the Silver State General
Assistance Program in the State General Fund for the deposit of money received for
the Program. Section 11 of this bill provides a procedure for the transfer of money
from the unrestricted balance of the State General Fund to the Account for the
provision of assistance under the Program for an extraordinary circumstance if
there is a specified minimum balance remaining in the State General Fund after the
-

transfer and the Governor has declared the existence of the extraordinary
circumstance.

Raw Text:
Senate Bill No. 3–Select Committee
on Health and Wellness
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to public assistance; establishing the Silver State
General Assistance Program within the Division of Social
Services of the Department of Human Services; setting forth
the powers and duties of the Administrator of the Division
relating to the Program; creating the Account for the Silver
State General Assistance Program; authorizing a transfer to
that Account from the unrestricted balance of the State
General Fund under certain circumstances; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law requires the Division of Social Services of the Department of
Human Services to administer various programs of public assistance. (Chapter
422A of NRS) Sections 2-9 of this bill establish the Silver State General Assistance
Program within the Division to provide temporary financial or in-kind assistance to
eligible persons and households who are experiencing an extraordinary
circumstance. Section 3 defines “extraordinary circumstance” as an event,
condition or situation that creates an unusual or significant need for State
intervention to protect the health, safety or general welfare of the residents of this
State, including a disruption in the provision of, suspension of or any related
reduction in benefits provided under a program of public assistance. Section 6
requires the Administrator of the Division to administer the Program within the
limitations of available money.
Section 7 prescribes requirements relating to eligibility for assistance under the
Program and requires the adoption of regulations for the administration of the
Program. Under existing law, the adoption of such regulations is exempt from
the Nevada Administrative Procedure Act. (NRS 233B.039) However, the
Administrator is required to comply with a procedure set forth in existing law for
adopting regulations for programs administered by the Division, which includes 30
days’ notice of the intended adoption. (NRS 422A.190) Sections 7 and 13 of this
bill exempt the Administrator from this procedure when adopting regulations for
the administration of the Program under certain circumstances, but require such
advance notice of such regulations as is practicable and the posting of the notice
and regulations on the Internet website of the Division.
Section 8 sets forth certain powers of the Administrator relating to the
Program. Section 9 makes certain information obtained by the Division in
the administration of the Program confidential. Section 9 also requires the
Administrator to submit an annual report regarding the Program. Section 12 of this
bill makes a conforming change relating to the confidentiality of certain
information obtained during the administration of the Program.
Section 10 of this bill creates the Account for the Silver State General
Assistance Program in the State General Fund for the deposit of money received for
the Program. Section 11 of this bill provides a procedure for the transfer of money
from the unrestricted balance of the State General Fund to the Account for the
provision of assistance under the Program for an extraordinary circumstance if
there is a specified minimum balance remaining in the State General Fund after the
-

transfer and the Governor has declared the existence of the extraordinary
circumstance.

the Program.

State General Fund to the Account for the Silver State General
Assistance Program created by section 10 of this act if:
(a) The Director determines that such a transfer will not cause
the projected ending balance of the State General Fund for the

3. If the Interim Finance Committee finds that a transfer
recommended by the State Board of Examiners should and may
lawfully be made, the Committee shall by resolution establish the
amount and direct the State Controller to transfer that amount to
the Account for the Silver State General Assistance Program. The
State Controller shall thereupon make the transfer.
4. Money transferred pursuant to this section to the Account
for the Silver State General Assistance Program is a continuing
appropriation solely for the purpose of authorizing the
expenditure of the transferred money for the provision of
assistance under the Program for the extraordinary circumstance.
