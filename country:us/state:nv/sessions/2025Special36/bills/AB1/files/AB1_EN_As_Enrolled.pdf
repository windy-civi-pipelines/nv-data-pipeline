Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law, with certain exceptions, requires the meetings of public bodies to
be open to the public. (NRS 241.020) Existing law exempts certain bodies from
such requirements and provides exceptions for certain meetings from such
requirements. (NRS 241.016) Sections 1.3 and 1.5 of this bill provide that a
meeting held between an agency or officer of the Executive Department of the State
Government and the Legislature to discuss certain threats relating to public services
and certain critical infrastructure controls or critical infrastructure information is a
closed meeting and is not subject to the provisions of the Open Meeting Law.
Section 1.3 further provides that certain information and materials relating to such
a meeting are confidential, not subject to subpoena or discovery, and not subject to
inspection by the general public. Section 1 of this bill makes a conforming change
to provide that such materials are not public records. Finally, section 1.3 prohibits
any person who attends such a closed meeting from disclosing any information or
materials received in preparation for or during such meeting to any person who is
not in the Executive Department of State Government or the Legislature.
Existing law provides that the Governor’s Technology Office within the Office
of the Governor is composed of: (1) the Director’s Office; (2) the Client Services
Division; (3) the Computing Services Division; (4) the Network Services Division,
including a Network Transport Services Unit and a Unified Communications Unit;

(5) the Office of Information Security and Cyber Defense; and (6) certain other
units, groups, divisions or departments deemed necessary by the Chief Information
Officer. (NRS 242.080) Section 13 of this bill creates the Security Operations
Center in the Office of Information Security and Cyber Defense.
Existing law: (1) requires the Governor’s Technology Office to provide certain
state agencies and elected officers with all their required design of information
systems; (2) authorizes certain other state agencies to negotiate with the Office for
its services or the use of its equipment; and (3) authorizes, upon request, the Office
to provide certain services to state agencies not under the control of the Governor
and local governmental agencies. (NRS 242.131, 242.141) Section 16 of this bill
requires the Security Operations Center to provide each state agency and elected
state officers with cybersecurity services, including real-time monitoring of
cyberinfrastructure, threat mitigation, incident response and cybersecurity
enforcement. Sections 16 and 30 of this bill reorganize provisions that authorize
certain state agencies and local governmental agencies to use the equipment and
services of the Governor’s Technology Office. Section 16 also requires any local
governmental agency and any state agency that is not an agency of the Executive
Department of the State Government which has agreed to use the equipment or
services of the Governor’s Technology Office to provide certain notification to the
Chief of the intent of the agency to withdraw from such use. Section 10 of this bill
revises the definition of “local governmental agency” to include the board of
trustees of a school district, which has the effect of authorizing the board of trustees
of a school district to use the services of the Governor’s Technology Office
pursuant to section 16. Section 11 of this bill amends the definition of “using
agency” so that the term includes any state agency, elected state officer or local
governmental agency that uses the services or equipment of the Office.
Section 2 of this bill requires the Security Operations Center to develop certain
policies and procedures to: (1) combat the increasing threats to using agencies
posed by cybercriminals; (2) protect sensitive data in the possession of a using
agency; and (3) ensure a coordinated and rapid response to any cybersecurity
incident that affects a using agency. Section 3 of this bill provides that if a using
agency does not comply with the cybersecurity policies and protocols developed by
the Security Operations Center, the Chief may impose additional oversight or audit
requirements on the using agency relating to cybersecurity.
Section 4 of this bill creates the Account for the Security Operations Center in
the State General Fund to be administered by the Chief. Section 4 requires the
money in the Account to be used for the purposes of supporting and carrying out
the duties of the Security Operations Center. Section 4 also authorizes the Security
Operations Center to serve as a fiscal agent to pool federal grant funds for the
purposes of cybersecurity support and infrastructure development.
Section 5 of this bill requires the Security Operations Center to collaborate
with the Office of Information Security and Cyber Defense to enhance
communication and coordination of incident responses to cyber threats or
cyberattacks on information systems.
Section 6 of this bill requires the Security Operations Center to prepare and
submit an annual report to the Governor, Attorney General and the Director of the
Legislative Counsel Bureau for transmission to the Legislature that includes certain
information relating to the duties of the Security Operations Center.
Section 7 of this bill provides that the provisions of the Nevada Revised
Statutes relating to information services do not impair or affect existing agreements
with a federally recognized Indian tribe and that any interlocal agreement entered
into must respect the sovereign governance of the tribe and provide for jointly
agreed upon data protocols.

Section 9 of this bill amends the definition of “information service,” as
provided by the Office to a using agency, to include the real-time monitoring of
cyberinfrastructure, threat mitigation, incident response and cybersecurity
enforcement.
Existing law makes certain legislative determinations and declarations relating
to the purpose of the Governor’s Technology Office. (NRS 242.071) Section 12 of
this bill revises these determinations and declarations to include performing
information services for using agencies.
Existing law provides that certain documents assembled, maintained, overseen
or prepared by the Governor’s Technology Office to mitigate, prevent or respond to
acts of terrorism are confidential. (NRS 242.105) Section 14 of this bill provides
that certain documents relating to the cybersecurity of a using agency are also
confidential.
Existing law requires the Chief to adopt certain regulations relating to
information systems of certain state agencies. (NRS 242.111) Section 15 of this bill
instead requires the Chief to adopt certain regulations relating to information
systems of using agencies.
Existing law requires the Chief to advise using agencies regarding the policy
for information services of the Executive Branch of Government. (NRS 242.151)
Section 17 of this bill requires the Chief to instead advise the using agencies of the
policy for information services of the Governor’s Technology Office.
Existing law provides that all equipment of an agency or elected state officer
which is owned or leased by the State must be under the managerial control of the
Office. (NRS 242.161) Section 18 of this bill: (1) provides instead that all
equipment of a using agency which is owned or leased by the State must be under
the managerial control of the Office; (2) prohibits the Security Operations Center
from assuming operational control of the equipment or software systems of a using
agency; and (3) requires the Security Operations Center to provide to a using
agency standards and policies for the equipment or software systems to be deployed
by the Security Operations Center, which must be agreed upon in writing before the
Security Operations Center provides services.
Section 19 of this bill provides that the Office is responsible for any application
of an information system which it furnishes to using agencies.
Section 20 of this bill requires: (1) any using agency which uses the equipment
or services of the Office to adhere to the regulations, standards, practices, policies
and conventions of the Office; and (2) each using agency to report certain
information relating to certain suspected incidents to the Office of Information
Security and Cyber Defense and the Security Operations Center.
Existing law requires the Deputy Director of the Office of Information Security
and Cyber Defense to investigate and resolve any breach of an information system
of a state agency or elected officer that uses the equipment or services of the
Governor’s Technology Office. (NRS 242.183) Section 21 of this bill requires
instead that the Deputy Director, in consultation with the Security Operations
Center, investigate and resolve any breach of an information system of a using
agency.
Existing law authorizes the Governor to proclaim the existence of a state of
emergency or a declaration of disaster if the Governor in his or her proclamation
finds that certain events, including a technological or man-made emergency or
disaster of major proportions, have actually occurred in this State and that the
safety and welfare of the inhabitants of this State require such a proclamation.

(NRS 414.070) If the Governor has made such a proclamation concerning a critical
cybersecurity incident, section 21 authorizes the Governor to authorize the
information technology personnel of using agencies of the Executive Branch to
report directly to the Chief.
Existing law provides that the amount receivable from a state agency or officer
or local governmental agency which uses the services of the Governor’s
Technology Office must be determined by the Chief. (NRS 242.191) Section 22 of
this bill provides instead that the amount receivable from a using agency which
uses the services or equipment of the Office must be determined by the Chief.
Section 23 of this bill requires each using agency using the services or
equipment of the Office to pay a fee for such use to the Fund for Information
Services.
Section 24 of this bill makes an appropriation to the Office of Finance in the
Office of the Governor for the Governor’s Technology Office within the Office of
the Governor for investments related to cybersecurity. Section 24 additionally
encourages the Governor’s Technology Office to, in collaboration with other
agencies, apply for grants for investments related to cybersecurity and requires,
under certain circumstances, the Office to reserve for reversion to the State General
Fund the amount of money received from such a grant. Sections 25-27 of this bill
make appropriations to the Office of Finance in the Office of the Governor for a
loan to the Governor’s Technology Office within the Office of the Governor to
cover a shortfall in revenues for certain divisions and offices within the Governor’s
Technology Office.
