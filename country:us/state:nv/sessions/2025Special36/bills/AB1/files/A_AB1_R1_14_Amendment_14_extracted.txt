39 school district to use the services of the Governor’s Technology Office pursuant to section 16.
40 Section 11 of this bill amends the definition of “using agency” so that the term includes any
41 state agency, elected state officer or local governmental agency that uses the services or
42 equipment of the Office.
43 Section 2 of this bill requires the Security Operations Center to develop certain policies
44 and procedures to: (1) combat the increasing threats to using agencies posed by
45 cybercriminals; (2) protect sensitive data in the possession of a using agency; and (3) ensure a

71 Office to a using agency, to include the real-time monitoring of cyberinfrastructure, threat
72 mitigation, incident response and cybersecurity enforcement.
73 Existing law makes certain legislative determinations and declarations relating to the

75 these determinations and declarations to include performing information services for using
76 agencies.
77 Existing law provides that certain documents assembled, maintained, overseen or
78 prepared by the Governor’s Technology Office to mitigate, prevent or respond to acts of
79 terrorism are confidential. (NRS 242.105) Section 14 of this bill provides that certain
80 documents relating to the cybersecurity of a using agency are also confidential.
81 Existing law requires the Chief to adopt certain regulations relating to information
82 systems of certain state agencies. (NRS 242.111) Section 15 of this bill instead requires the
83 Chief to adopt certain regulations relating to information systems of using agencies.
84 Existing law requires the Chief to advise using agencies regarding the policy for
85 information services of the Executive Branch of Government. (NRS 242.151) Section 17 of

87 services of the Governor’s Technology Office.
88 Existing law provides that all equipment of an agency or elected state officer which is
89 owned or leased by the State must be under the managerial control of the Office. (NRS

91 which is owned or leased by the State must be under the managerial control of the Office; (2)
92 prohibits the Security Operations Center from assuming operational control of the equipment
93 or software systems of a using agency; and (3) requires the Security Operations Center to

95 deployed by the Security Operations Center, which must be agreed upon in writing before the
96 Security Operations Center provides services.
97 Section 19 of this bill provides that the Office is responsible for any application of an
98 information system which it furnishes to using agencies.
99 Section 20 of this bill requires: (1) any using agency which uses the equipment or
100 services of the Office to adhere to the regulations, standards, practices, policies and
101 conventions of the Office; and (2) each using agency to report certain information relating to
102 certain suspected incidents to the Office of Information Security and Cyber Defense and the
103 Security Operations Center.
104 Existing law requires the Deputy Director of the Office of Information Security and
105 Cyber Defense to investigate and resolve any breach of an information system of a state
106 agency or elected officer that uses the equipment or services of the Governor’s Technology
107 Office. (NRS 242.183) Section 21 of this bill requires instead that the Deputy Director, in
108 consultation with the Security Operations Center, investigate and resolve any breach of an
109 information system of a using agency.
110 Existing law authorizes the Governor to proclaim the existence of a state of emergency or
111 a declaration of disaster if the Governor in his or her proclamation finds that certain events,
112 including a technological or man-made emergency or disaster of major proportions, have
113 actually occurred in this State and that the safety and welfare of the inhabitants of this State
114 require such a proclamation. (NRS 414.070) If the Governor has made such a proclamation
115 concerning a critical cybersecurity incident, section 21 authorizes the Governor to authorize
116 the information technology personnel of using agencies of the Executive Branch to report
117 directly to the Chief.
118 Existing law provides that the amount receivable from a state agency or officer or local

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law, with certain exceptions, requires the meetings of public bodies to be open to
2 the public. (NRS 241.020) Existing law exempts certain bodies from such requirements and
3 provides exceptions for certain meetings from such requirements. (NRS 241.016) Sections 1.3
4 and 1.5 of this bill provide that a meeting held between an agency or officer of the Executive
5 Department of the State Government and the Legislature to discuss certain threats relating to
6 public services and certain critical infrastructure controls or critical infrastructure information
7 is a closed meeting and is not subject to the provisions of the Open Meeting Law. Section 1.3
8 further provides that certain information and materials relating to such a meeting are
9 confidential, not subject to subpoena or discovery, and not subject to inspection by the general

Senate Amendment No. 14 to Assembly Bill No. 1 First Reprint Page 4
10 public. Section 1 of this bill makes a conforming change to provide that such materials are not
11 public records. Finally, section 1.3 prohibits any person who attends such a closed meeting
12 from disclosing any information or materials received in preparation for or during such
13 meeting to any person who is not in the Executive Department of State Government or the
14 Legislature.
15 Existing law provides that the Governor’s Technology Office within the Office of the
16 Governor is composed of: (1) the Director’s Office; (2) the Client Services Division; (3) the
17 Computing Services Division; (4) the Network Services Division, including a Network
18 Transport Services Unit and a Unified Communications Unit; (5) the Office of Information
19 Security and Cyber Defense; and (6) certain other units, groups, divisions or departments
20 deemed necessary by the Chief Information Officer. (NRS 242.080) Section 13 of this bill
21 creates the Security Operations Center in the Office of Information Security and Cyber
22 Defense.
23 Existing law: (1) requires the Governor’s Technology Office to provide certain state
24 agencies and elected officers with all their required design of information systems; (2)
25 authorizes certain other state agencies to negotiate with the Office for its services or the use of
26 its equipment; and (3) authorizes, upon request, the Office to provide certain services to state
27 agencies not under the control of the Governor and local governmental agencies. (NRS
28 242.131, 242.141) Section 16 of this bill requires the Security Operations Center to provide
29 each state agency and elected state officers with cybersecurity services, including real-time
30 monitoring of cyberinfrastructure, threat mitigation, incident response and cybersecurity
31 enforcement. Sections 16 and 30 of this bill reorganize provisions that authorize certain state
32 agencies and local governmental agencies to use the equipment and services of the Governor’s
33 Technology Office. Section 16 also requires any local governmental agency and any state
34 agency that is not an agency of the Executive Department of the State Government which has
35 agreed to use the equipment or services of the Governor’s Technology Office to provide
36 certain notification to the Chief of the intent of the agency to withdraw from such use. Section
37 10 of this bill revises the definition of “local governmental agency” to include the board of
38 trustees of a school district, which has the effect of authorizing the board of trustees of a
39 school district to use the services of the Governor’s Technology Office pursuant to section 16.
40 Section 11 of this bill amends the definition of “using agency” so that the term includes any
41 state agency, elected state officer or local governmental agency that uses the services or
42 equipment of the Office.
43 Section 2 of this bill requires the Security Operations Center to develop certain policies
44 and procedures to: (1) combat the increasing threats to using agencies posed by
45 cybercriminals; (2) protect sensitive data in the possession of a using agency; and (3) ensure a
46 coordinated and rapid response to any cybersecurity incident that affects a using agency.
47 Section 3 of this bill provides that if a using agency does not comply with the cybersecurity
48 policies and protocols developed by the Security Operations Center, the Chief may impose
49 additional oversight or audit requirements on the using agency relating to cybersecurity.
50 Section 4 of this bill creates the Account for the Security Operations Center in the State
51 General Fund to be administered by the Chief. Section 4 requires the money in the Account to
52 be used for the purposes of supporting and carrying out the duties of the Security Operations
53 Center. Section 4 also authorizes the Security Operations Center to serve as a fiscal agent to
54 pool federal grant funds for the purposes of cybersecurity support and infrastructure
55 development.
56 Section 5 of this bill requires the Security Operations Center to collaborate with the
57 Office of Information Security and Cyber Defense to enhance communication and
58 coordination of incident responses to cyber threats or cyberattacks on information systems.
59 Section 6 of this bill requires the Security Operations Center to prepare and submit an
60 annual report to the Governor, Attorney General and the Director of the Legislative Counsel
61 Bureau for transmission to the Legislature that includes certain information relating to the
62 duties of the Security Operations Center.
63 Section 7 of this bill provides that the provisions of the Nevada Revised Statutes relating
64 to information services do not impair or affect existing agreements with a federally recognized
65 Indian tribe and that any interlocal agreement entered into must respect the sovereign
66 governance of the tribe and provide for jointly agreed upon data protocols.

Senate Amendment No. 14 to Assembly Bill No. 1 First Reprint Page 5
67 To the extent that funding is available, section 8 of this bill requires the Security
68 Operations Center, in collaboration with the Nevada System of Higher Education, to develop
69 the Cybersecurity Talent Pipeline Program.
70 Section 9 of this bill amends the definition of “information service,” as provided by the
71 Office to a using agency, to include the real-time monitoring of cyberinfrastructure, threat
72 mitigation, incident response and cybersecurity enforcement.
73 Existing law makes certain legislative determinations and declarations relating to the
74 purpose of the Governor’s Technology Office. (NRS 242.071) Section 12 of this bill revises
75 these determinations and declarations to include performing information services for using
76 agencies.
77 Existing law provides that certain documents assembled, maintained, overseen or
78 prepared by the Governor’s Technology Office to mitigate, prevent or respond to acts of
79 terrorism are confidential. (NRS 242.105) Section 14 of this bill provides that certain
80 documents relating to the cybersecurity of a using agency are also confidential.
81 Existing law requires the Chief to adopt certain regulations relating to information
82 systems of certain state agencies. (NRS 242.111) Section 15 of this bill instead requires the
83 Chief to adopt certain regulations relating to information systems of using agencies.
84 Existing law requires the Chief to advise using agencies regarding the policy for
85 information services of the Executive Branch of Government. (NRS 242.151) Section 17 of
86 this bill requires the Chief to instead advise the using agencies of the policy for information
87 services of the Governor’s Technology Office.
88 Existing law provides that all equipment of an agency or elected state officer which is
89 owned or leased by the State must be under the managerial control of the Office. (NRS
90 242.161) Section 18 of this bill: (1) provides instead that all equipment of a using agency
91 which is owned or leased by the State must be under the managerial control of the Office; (2)
92 prohibits the Security Operations Center from assuming operational control of the equipment
93 or software systems of a using agency; and (3) requires the Security Operations Center to
94 provide to a using agency standards and policies for the equipment or software systems to be
95 deployed by the Security Operations Center, which must be agreed upon in writing before the
96 Security Operations Center provides services.
97 Section 19 of this bill provides that the Office is responsible for any application of an
98 information system which it furnishes to using agencies.
99 Section 20 of this bill requires: (1) any using agency which uses the equipment or
100 services of the Office to adhere to the regulations, standards, practices, policies and
101 conventions of the Office; and (2) each using agency to report certain information relating to
102 certain suspected incidents to the Office of Information Security and Cyber Defense and the
103 Security Operations Center.
104 Existing law requires the Deputy Director of the Office of Information Security and
105 Cyber Defense to investigate and resolve any breach of an information system of a state
106 agency or elected officer that uses the equipment or services of the Governor’s Technology
107 Office. (NRS 242.183) Section 21 of this bill requires instead that the Deputy Director, in
108 consultation with the Security Operations Center, investigate and resolve any breach of an
109 information system of a using agency.
110 Existing law authorizes the Governor to proclaim the existence of a state of emergency or
111 a declaration of disaster if the Governor in his or her proclamation finds that certain events,
112 including a technological or man-made emergency or disaster of major proportions, have
113 actually occurred in this State and that the safety and welfare of the inhabitants of this State
114 require such a proclamation. (NRS 414.070) If the Governor has made such a proclamation
115 concerning a critical cybersecurity incident, section 21 authorizes the Governor to authorize
116 the information technology personnel of using agencies of the Executive Branch to report
117 directly to the Chief.
118 Existing law provides that the amount receivable from a state agency or officer or local
119 governmental agency which uses the services of the Governor’s Technology Office must be
120 determined by the Chief. (NRS 242.191) Section 22 of this bill provides instead that the
121 amount receivable from a using agency which uses the services or equipment of the Office
122 must be determined by the Chief.
123 Section 23 of this bill requires each using agency using the services or equipment of the
124 Office to pay a fee for such use to the Fund for Information Services.

127 investments related to cybersecurity. Section 24 additionally encourages the Governor’s
128 Technology Office to, in collaboration with other agencies, apply for grants for investments
129 related to cybersecurity and requires , under certain circumstances, the Office to [deposit]
130 reserve for reversion to the State General Fund the amount of money received from such a
131 grant . [in the State General Fund until the total amount deposited matches the total amount
