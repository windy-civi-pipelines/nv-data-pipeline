Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law, with certain exceptions, requires the meetings of public bodies to
2 be open to the public. (NRS 241.020) Existing law exempts certain bodies from
3 such requirements and provides exceptions for certain meetings from such
4 requirements. (NRS 241.016) Sections 1.3 and 1.5 of this bill provide that a
5 meeting held between an agency or officer of the Executive Department of the State
6 Government and the Legislature to discuss certain threats relating to public services
7 and certain critical infrastructure controls or critical infrastructure information is a
8 closed meeting and is not subject to the provisions of the Open Meeting Law.
9 Section 1.3 further provides that certain information and materials relating to such
10 a meeting are confidential, not subject to subpoena or discovery, and not subject to
11 inspection by the general public. Section 1 of this bill makes a conforming change
12 to provide that such materials are not public records. Finally, section 1.3 prohibits
13 any person who attends such a closed meeting from disclosing any information or
14 materials received in preparation for or during such meeting to any person who is
15 not in the Executive Department of State Government or the Legislature.
16 Existing law provides that the Governor’s Technology Office within the Office
17 of the Governor is composed of: (1) the Director’s Office; (2) the Client Services
18 Division; (3) the Computing Services Division; (4) the Network Services Division,
19 including a Network Transport Services Unit and a Unified Communications Unit;
20 (5) the Office of Information Security and Cyber Defense; and (6) certain other
21 units, groups, divisions or departments deemed necessary by the Chief Information
22 Officer. (NRS 242.080) Section 13 of this bill creates the Security Operations
23 Center in the Office of Information Security and Cyber Defense.
24 Existing law: (1) requires the Governor’s Technology Office to provide certain
25 state agencies and elected officers with all their required design of information
26 systems; (2) authorizes certain other state agencies to negotiate with the Office for
27 its services or the use of its equipment; and (3) authorizes, upon request, the Office
28 to provide certain services to state agencies not under the control of the Governor
29 and local governmental agencies. (NRS 242.131, 242.141) Section 16 of this bill
30 requires the Security Operations Center to provide each state agency and elected
31 state officers with cybersecurity services, including real-time monitoring of
32 cyberinfrastructure, threat mitigation, incident response and cybersecurity
33 enforcement. Sections 16 and 30 of this bill reorganize provisions that authorize
34 certain state agencies and local governmental agencies to use the equipment and
35 services of the Governor’s Technology Office. Section 16 also requires any local
36 governmental agency and any state agency that is not an agency of the Executive
37 Department of the State Government which has agreed to use the equipment or
38 services of the Governor’s Technology Office to provide certain notification to the
39 Chief of the intent of the agency to withdraw from such use. Section 10 of this bill
40 revises the definition of “local governmental agency” to include the board of
41 trustees of a school district, which has the effect of authorizing the board of trustees
42 of a school district to use the services of the Governor’s Technology Office
43 pursuant to section 16. Section 11 of this bill amends the definition of “using
44 agency” so that the term includes any state agency, elected state officer or local
45 governmental agency that uses the services or equipment of the Office.
46 Section 2 of this bill requires the Security Operations Center to develop certain
47 policies and procedures to: (1) combat the increasing threats to using agencies
48 posed by cybercriminals; (2) protect sensitive data in the possession of a using
49 agency; and (3) ensure a coordinated and rapid response to any cybersecurity
50 incident that affects a using agency. Section 3 of this bill provides that if a using
51 agency does not comply with the cybersecurity policies and protocols developed by
52 the Security Operations Center, the Chief may impose additional oversight or audit
53 requirements on the using agency relating to cybersecurity.

58 Operations Center to serve as a fiscal agent to pool federal grant funds for the
59 purposes of cybersecurity support and infrastructure development.

72 agreed upon data protocols.

78 cyberinfrastructure, threat mitigation, incident response and cybersecurity
79 enforcement.
80 Existing law makes certain legislative determinations and declarations relating
81 to the purpose of the Governor’s Technology Office. (NRS 242.071) Section 12 of
82 this bill revises these determinations and declarations to include performing
83 information services for using agencies.
84 Existing law provides that certain documents assembled, maintained, overseen
85 or prepared by the Governor’s Technology Office to mitigate, prevent or respond to
86 acts of terrorism are confidential. (NRS 242.105) Section 14 of this bill provides
87 that certain documents relating to the cybersecurity of a using agency are also
88 confidential.
89 Existing law requires the Chief to adopt certain regulations relating to
90 information systems of certain state agencies. (NRS 242.111) Section 15 of this bill

96 policy for information services of the Governor’s Technology Office.
97 Existing law provides that all equipment of an agency or elected state officer
98 which is owned or leased by the State must be under the managerial control of the
99 Office. (NRS 242.161) Section 18 of this bill: (1) provides instead that all
100 equipment of a using agency which is owned or leased by the State must be under
101 the managerial control of the Office; (2) prohibits the Security Operations Center
102 from assuming operational control of the equipment or software systems of a using

105 by the Security Operations Center, which must be agreed upon in writing before the
106 Security Operations Center provides services.
107 Section 19 of this bill provides that the Office is responsible for any application
108 of an information system which it furnishes to using agencies.

112 information relating to certain suspected incidents to the Office of Information
113 Security and Cyber Defense and the Security Operations Center.
114 Existing law requires the Deputy Director of the Office of Information Security
115 and Cyber Defense to investigate and resolve any breach of an information system
116 of a state agency or elected officer that uses the equipment or services of the
117 Governor’s Technology Office. (NRS 242.183) Section 21 of this bill requires

119 Center, investigate and resolve any breach of an information system of a using
120 agency.
121 Existing law authorizes the Governor to proclaim the existence of a state of
122 emergency or a declaration of disaster if the Governor in his or her proclamation
123 finds that certain events, including a technological or man-made emergency or
124 disaster of major proportions, have actually occurred in this State and that the
125 safety and welfare of the inhabitants of this State require such a proclamation.
126 (NRS 414.070) If the Governor has made such a proclamation concerning a critical
127 cybersecurity incident, section 21 authorizes the Governor to authorize the
128 information technology personnel of using agencies of the Executive Branch to
129 report directly to the Chief.
130 Existing law provides that the amount receivable from a state agency or officer
131 or local governmental agency which uses the services of the Governor’s

142 agencies, apply for grants for investments related to cybersecurity and requires,
143 under certain circumstances, the Office to reserve for reversion to the State General
144 Fund the amount of money received from such a grant. Sections 25-27 of this bill
