1 Rule No. 11.5. Legislative Ethics.
2 1. Each Legislator is subject, at all times, to the Legislative
3 Code of Ethical Standards in the Joint Standing Rules of the
4 Senate and Assembly for the 83rd Session of the Legislature and,
5 in addition, must determine whether he or she has a conflict of
6 interest upon any matter in question before the Legislator. In
7 determining whether the Legislator has such a conflict of interest,
8 the Legislator should consider whether the independence of
9 judgment of a reasonable person in his or her situation upon the
10 matter in question would be materially affected by the
11 Legislator’s:
12 (a) Acceptance of a gift or loan;
13 (b) Private economic interest; or
14 (c) Commitment to a member of his or her household or his or
15 her immediate family.
16  In interpreting and applying the provisions of this subsection, it
17 must be presumed that the independence of judgment of a
18 reasonable person in the Legislator’s situation would not be
19 materially affected by the Legislator’s private economic interest or
20 the Legislator’s commitment to a member of his or her household
21 or immediate family where the resulting benefit or detriment
22 accruing to the Legislator, or if the Legislator has a commitment
23 to a member of his or her household or immediate family,
24 accruing to those other persons, is not greater than that accruing
25 to any other member of the general business, profession,
26 occupation or group that is affected by the matter.
27 2. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3, if a
28 Legislator knows he or she has a conflict of interest pursuant to
29 subsection 1, the Legislator shall make a general disclosure of the
30 conflict of interest on the record in a meeting of a committee or on
31 the floor of the Senate, as applicable. Such a disclosure must be
32 entered:
33 (a) If the Legislator makes the disclosure in a meeting of a
34 committee, in the minutes for that meeting.
35 (b) If the Legislator makes the disclosure on the floor of the
36 Senate, in the Journal.
37 3. If, on one or more prior occasions during the current
38 session of the Legislature, a Legislator has made a general
39 disclosure of a conflict of interest on the record in a meeting of a
40 committee or on the floor of the Senate, the Legislator is not
41 required to make that general disclosure at length again regarding
42 the same conflict of interest if, when the matter in question arises
43 on subsequent occasions, the Legislator makes a reference on the
44 record to the previous disclosure.

*SR1*
– 6 –
1 4. In determining whether to abstain from voting upon,
2 advocating or opposing a matter concerning which a Legislator
3 has a conflict of interest pursuant to subsection 1, the Legislator
4 should consider whether:
5 (a) The conflict impedes his or her independence of judgment;
6 and
7 (b) His or her interest is greater than the interests of an entire
8 class of persons similarly situated.
9 5. The provisions of this Rule do not under any
10 circumstances and regardless of any conflict of interest:
11 (a) Prohibit a Legislator from requesting or introducing a
12 legislative measure; or
13 (b) Require a Legislator to take any particular action before or
14 while requesting or introducing a legislative measure.
15 6. If a Legislator who is a member of a committee declares on
16 the record when a vote is to be taken by the committee that he or
17 she will abstain from voting because of the requirements of this
18 Rule, the necessary quorum to act upon and the number of votes
19 necessary to act upon the matter is reduced as though the
20 Legislator abstaining were not a member of the committee.
21 7. The standards and procedures set forth in this Rule which
22 govern whether and to what extent a Senator has a conflict of
23 interest, should disclose a conflict of interest or should abstain
24 from voting upon, advocating or opposing a matter concerning
25 which the Senator has a conflict of interest pursuant to
26 subsection 1:
27 (a) Are exclusive and are the only standards and procedures
28 that apply to Senators with regard to such matters; and
29 (b) Supersede and preempt all other standards and procedures
30 with regard to such matters,
31  except that this subsection does not exempt any Senators from
32 the Legislative Code of Ethical Standards in the Joint Standing
33 Rules.
34 8. For purposes of this Rule, “immediate family” means a
35 person who is related to the Legislator by blood, adoption or
36 marriage within the first degree of consanguinity or affinity.

27 D. REMOTE-TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS
28
29 Rule No. 50. Authorized Use of Remote-Technology Systems in
30 Exceptional Circumstances.
31 1. As used in this Rule, “remote-technology system” means
32 any system or other means of communication that is:
33 (a) Approved by the Majority Leader and uses any electronic,
34 digital or other similar technology to enable a member of the
35 Senate from a remote location to attend, participate, vote and take
36 any other action in any proceedings of the Senate or the
37 Committee of the Whole even though the member is not physically
38 present within the Senate Chambers or at a meeting of the
39 Committee of the Whole.
40 (b) Approved by the chair of a committee, other than the
41 Committee of the Whole, and uses any electronic, digital or other
42 similar technology to enable a member of the Senate from a
43 remote location to attend, participate, vote and take any other
44 action in any proceedings of the committee even though the
45 member is not physically present at a meeting of the committee.
-
*SR1*
– 17 –
1 2. Upon request by a member of the Senate:
2 (a) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, the
3 Majority Leader may authorize the member to use a remote-
4 technology system to attend, participate, vote and take any other
5 action in any proceedings of the Senate or the Committee of the
6 Whole if the Majority Leader determines that exceptional
7 circumstances warrant such use by the member. If the Majority
8 Leader grants such authorization:
9 (1) It must be entered in the Journal of the Senate.
10 (2) A member who uses a remote-technology system to
11 attend or participate in a proceeding of the Senate may not vote on
12 any matter on which a vote is taken in that proceeding unless the
13 member is using the remote-technology system to attend or
14 participate in the proceeding from a location in this State.
15 (b) The chair of a committee, other than the Committee of the
16 Whole, with the approval of the Majority Leader, may authorize
17 the member to use a remote-technology system to attend,
18 participate, vote and take any other action in any proceedings of
19 the committee if the chair and the Majority Leader determine that
20 exceptional circumstances warrant such use by the member. If the
21 chair grants such authorization, it must be entered in the records
22 of the committee.
23 3. Except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (2) of
24 paragraph (a) of subsection 2, if a member of the Senate uses a
25 remote-technology system to attend, participate, vote and take any
26 other action in any proceedings pursuant to this Rule, the member
27 shall be deemed to be present and in attendance at the proceedings
28 for all purposes.
29 4. For the purposes of voting in proceedings of:
30 (a) The Committee of the Whole, the Secretary of the Senate or
31 an authorized assistant shall call the roll of each member who is
32 authorized to use a remote-technology system for the proceedings
33 and, in accordance with the procedures of the Senate, cause the
34 member’s vote to be entered into the record for the purposes of the
35 records of the Committee of the Whole.
36 (b) A committee, other than the Committee of the Whole, the
37 committee secretary shall call the roll of each member who is
38 authorized to use a remote-technology system for the proceedings
39 and, in accordance with the procedures of the committee, cause
40 the member’s vote to be entered into the record for the purposes of
41 the records of the committee.
42 5. This Rule supersedes, takes precedence and controls over
43 any other rule, provision or principle of law to the extent of any
44 conflict with this Rule.
45 6. The Senate hereby finds and declares that:
-
*SR1*
– 18 –
1 (a) The Nevada Constitution invests each House of the
2 Legislature with certain plenary and exclusive constitutional
3 powers which may be exercised only by that House and which
4 cannot be usurped, infringed or impaired by the other House or by
5 any other branch of Nevada’s State Government. (Heller v.
6 Legislature, 120 Nev. 456 (2004); Commission on Ethics v. Hardy,
7 125 Nev. 285 (2009); Mason’s Manual of Legislative Procedure §§
8 2-3 & 560-564 (2010) (Mason’s Manual))
9 (b) Section 6 of Article 4 of the Nevada Constitution invests
10 each House with plenary and exclusive constitutional powers to
11 determine the rules of its proceedings and to govern, control and
12 regulate its membership and its internal organization, affairs and
13 management, expressly providing that: “Each House shall judge
14 of the qualifications, elections and returns of its own members,
15 choose its own officers (except the President of the Senate),
16 determine the rules of its proceedings and may punish its members
17 for disorderly conduct, and with the concurrence of two thirds of
18 all the members elected, expel a member.”
19 (c) In addition to its plenary and exclusive constitutional
20 powers, each House possesses certain inherent powers of
21 institutional self-protection and self-preservation to govern,
22 control and regulate its membership and its internal organization,
23 affairs and management. (In re Chapman, 166 U.S. 661, 668
24 (1897); Mason’s Manual § 2; Luther S. Cushing, Elements of the
25 Law & Practice of Legislative Assemblies § 533 (1856) (Cushing’s
26 Legislative Assemblies))
27 (d) The inherent powers of each House are considered “so
28 essential to the authority of a legislative assembly, that it cannot
29 well exist without them; and they are consequently entitled to be
30 regarded as belonging to every such assembly as a necessary
31 incident.” (Cushing’s Legislative Assemblies § 533)
32 (e) The inherent powers of each House authorize it to take all
33 necessary and proper institutional actions that are “recognized by
34 the common parliamentary law.” (Cushing’s Legislative
35 Assemblies § 684)
36 (f) Thus, it is well established that each House is “vested with
37 all the powers and privileges which are necessary and incidental to
38 a free and unobstructed exercise of its appropriate functions.
39 These powers and privileges are derived not from the Constitution;
40 on the contrary, they arise from the very creation of a legislative
41 body, and are founded upon the principle of self-preservation.”
42 (Ex parte McCarthy, 29 Cal. 395, 403 (1866))
43 (g) Under the Nevada Constitution, there are no constitutional
44 provisions establishing a particular method for determining
-
*SR1*
– 19 –
1 whether a member of either House is present at legislative
2 proceedings.
3 (h) The United States Supreme Court has held that when there
4 are no constitutional provisions establishing a particular method
5 for determining whether a member of a legislative house is present
6 at legislative proceedings, “it is therefore within the competency of
7 the house to prescribe any method which shall be reasonably
8 certain to ascertain the fact.” (United States v. Ballin, 144 U.S. 1,
9 6 (1892))
10 (i) The United States Supreme Court has also held that when a
11 legislative house adopts a rule establishing a reasonable method
12 for determining whether a member is present at legislative
13 proceedings, that rule must be given great deference by the courts
14 because:
15 Neither do the advantages or disadvantages, the wisdom or
16 folly, of such a rule present any matters for judicial
17 consideration. With the courts the question is only one of
18 power. The constitution empowers each house to determine
19 its rules of proceedings. It may not by its rules ignore
20 constitutional restraints or violate fundamental rights, and
21 there should be a reasonable relation between the mode or
22 method of proceeding established by the rule and the result
23 which is sought to be attained. But within these limitations
24 all matters of method are open to the determination of the
25 house, and it is no impeachment of the rule to say that some
26 other way would be better, more accurate, or even more just.
27 It is no objection to the validity of a rule that a different one
28 has been prescribed and in force for a length of time. The
29 power to make rules is not one which once exercised is
30 exhausted. It is a continuous power, always subject to be
31 exercised by the house, and, within the limitations
32 suggested, absolute and beyond the challenge of any other
33 body or tribunal.
34
35 (United States v. Ballin, 144 U.S. 1, 5 (1892))
36 7. The Senate hereby exercises its constitutional and inherent
37 powers and privileges and adopts this Rule to:
38 (a) Govern, control and regulate its membership and its
39 internal organization, affairs and management;
40 (b) Ensure its institutional self-protection and self-
41 preservation; and
-
*SR1*
– 20 –
1 (c) Establish a reasonable method for determining whether a
2 member of the Senate is present at legislative proceedings during
3 exceptional circumstances.
4
5 And be it further
6 RESOLVED, That this resolution becomes effective upon
7 adoption.

2 1. Each Legislator is subject, at all times, to the Legislative
3 Code of Ethical Standards in the Joint Standing Rules of the
4 Senate and Assembly for the 83rd Session of the Legislature and,
5 in addition, must determine whether he or she has a conflict of
6 interest upon any matter in question before the Legislator. In
7 determining whether the Legislator has such a conflict of interest,
8 the Legislator should consider whether the independence of
9 judgment of a reasonable person in his or her situation upon the
10 matter in question would be materially affected by the
11 Legislator’s:
12 (a) Acceptance of a gift or loan;
13 (b) Private economic interest; or
14 (c) Commitment to a member of his or her household or his or
15 her immediate family.
16  In interpreting and applying the provisions of this subsection, it
17 must be presumed that the independence of judgment of a
18 reasonable person in the Legislator’s situation would not be
19 materially affected by the Legislator’s private economic interest or
20 the Legislator’s commitment to a member of his or her household
21 or immediate family where the resulting benefit or detriment
22 accruing to the Legislator, or if the Legislator has a commitment
23 to a member of his or her household or immediate family,
24 accruing to those other persons, is not greater than that accruing
25 to any other member of the general business, profession,
26 occupation or group that is affected by the matter.
27 2. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3, if a
28 Legislator knows he or she has a conflict of interest pursuant to
29 subsection 1, the Legislator shall make a general disclosure of the
30 conflict of interest on the record in a meeting of a committee or on
31 the floor of the Senate, as applicable. Such a disclosure must be
32 entered:
33 (a) If the Legislator makes the disclosure in a meeting of a
34 committee, in the minutes for that meeting.
35 (b) If the Legislator makes the disclosure on the floor of the
36 Senate, in the Journal.
37 3. If, on one or more prior occasions during the current
38 session of the Legislature, a Legislator has made a general
39 disclosure of a conflict of interest on the record in a meeting of a
40 committee or on the floor of the Senate, the Legislator is not
41 required to make that general disclosure at length again regarding
42 the same conflict of interest if, when the matter in question arises
43 on subsequent occasions, the Legislator makes a reference on the
44 record to the previous disclosure.

1 4. In determining whether to abstain from voting upon,
2 advocating or opposing a matter concerning which a Legislator
3 has a conflict of interest pursuant to subsection 1, the Legislator
4 should consider whether:
5 (a) The conflict impedes his or her independence of judgment;
6 and
7 (b) His or her interest is greater than the interests of an entire
8 class of persons similarly situated.
9 5. The provisions of this Rule do not under any
10 circumstances and regardless of any conflict of interest:
11 (a) Prohibit a Legislator from requesting or introducing a
12 legislative measure; or
13 (b) Require a Legislator to take any particular action before or
14 while requesting or introducing a legislative measure.
15 6. If a Legislator who is a member of a committee declares on
16 the record when a vote is to be taken by the committee that he or
17 she will abstain from voting because of the requirements of this
18 Rule, the necessary quorum to act upon and the number of votes
19 necessary to act upon the matter is reduced as though the
20 Legislator abstaining were not a member of the committee.
21 7. The standards and procedures set forth in this Rule which
22 govern whether and to what extent a Senator has a conflict of
23 interest, should disclose a conflict of interest or should abstain
24 from voting upon, advocating or opposing a matter concerning
25 which the Senator has a conflict of interest pursuant to
26 subsection 1:
27 (a) Are exclusive and are the only standards and procedures
28 that apply to Senators with regard to such matters; and
29 (b) Supersede and preempt all other standards and procedures
30 with regard to such matters,
31  except that this subsection does not exempt any Senators from
32 the Legislative Code of Ethical Standards in the Joint Standing
33 Rules.
34 8. For purposes of this Rule, “immediate family” means a
35 person who is related to the Legislator by blood, adoption or

33 (a) Approved by the Majority Leader and uses any electronic,
34 digital or other similar technology to enable a member of the
35 Senate from a remote location to attend, participate, vote and take
36 any other action in any proceedings of the Senate or the
37 Committee of the Whole even though the member is not physically
38 present within the Senate Chambers or at a meeting of the
39 Committee of the Whole.
40 (b) Approved by the chair of a committee, other than the
41 Committee of the Whole, and uses any electronic, digital or other
42 similar technology to enable a member of the Senate from a
43 remote location to attend, participate, vote and take any other
44 action in any proceedings of the committee even though the
45 member is not physically present at a meeting of the committee.
-
*SR1*

– 17 –
1 2. Upon request by a member of the Senate:
2 (a) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, the
3 Majority Leader may authorize the member to use a remote-
4 technology system to attend, participate, vote and take any other
5 action in any proceedings of the Senate or the Committee of the
6 Whole if the Majority Leader determines that exceptional
7 circumstances warrant such use by the member. If the Majority
8 Leader grants such authorization:
9 (1) It must be entered in the Journal of the Senate.
10 (2) A member who uses a remote-technology system to
11 attend or participate in a proceeding of the Senate may not vote on
12 any matter on which a vote is taken in that proceeding unless the
13 member is using the remote-technology system to attend or
14 participate in the proceeding from a location in this State.
15 (b) The chair of a committee, other than the Committee of the
16 Whole, with the approval of the Majority Leader, may authorize
17 the member to use a remote-technology system to attend,
18 participate, vote and take any other action in any proceedings of
19 the committee if the chair and the Majority Leader determine that
20 exceptional circumstances warrant such use by the member. If the
21 chair grants such authorization, it must be entered in the records
22 of the committee.
23 3. Except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (2) of
24 paragraph (a) of subsection 2, if a member of the Senate uses a
25 remote-technology system to attend, participate, vote and take any
26 other action in any proceedings pursuant to this Rule, the member
27 shall be deemed to be present and in attendance at the proceedings
28 for all purposes.
29 4. For the purposes of voting in proceedings of:
30 (a) The Committee of the Whole, the Secretary of the Senate or
31 an authorized assistant shall call the roll of each member who is
32 authorized to use a remote-technology system for the proceedings
33 and, in accordance with the procedures of the Senate, cause the
34 member’s vote to be entered into the record for the purposes of the
35 records of the Committee of the Whole.
36 (b) A committee, other than the Committee of the Whole, the
37 committee secretary shall call the roll of each member who is
38 authorized to use a remote-technology system for the proceedings
39 and, in accordance with the procedures of the committee, cause
40 the member’s vote to be entered into the record for the purposes of
41 the records of the committee.
42 5. This Rule supersedes, takes precedence and controls over
43 any other rule, provision or principle of law to the extent of any
44 conflict with this Rule.
45 6. The Senate hereby finds and declares that:
-
*SR1*

– 18 –
1 (a) The Nevada Constitution invests each House of the
2 Legislature with certain plenary and exclusive constitutional
3 powers which may be exercised only by that House and which
4 cannot be usurped, infringed or impaired by the other House or by
5 any other branch of Nevada’s State Government. (Heller v.
6 Legislature, 120 Nev. 456 (2004); Commission on Ethics v. Hardy,
7 125 Nev. 285 (2009); Mason’s Manual of Legislative Procedure §§
8 2-3 & 560-564 (2010) (Mason’s Manual))
9 (b) Section 6 of Article 4 of the Nevada Constitution invests
10 each House with plenary and exclusive constitutional powers to
11 determine the rules of its proceedings and to govern, control and
12 regulate its membership and its internal organization, affairs and
13 management, expressly providing that: “Each House shall judge
14 of the qualifications, elections and returns of its own members,
15 choose its own officers (except the President of the Senate),
16 determine the rules of its proceedings and may punish its members
17 for disorderly conduct, and with the concurrence of two thirds of
18 all the members elected, expel a member.”
19 (c) In addition to its plenary and exclusive constitutional
20 powers, each House possesses certain inherent powers of
21 institutional self-protection and self-preservation to govern,
22 control and regulate its membership and its internal organization,
23 affairs and management. (In re Chapman, 166 U.S. 661, 668
24 (1897); Mason’s Manual § 2; Luther S. Cushing, Elements of the
25 Law & Practice of Legislative Assemblies § 533 (1856) (Cushing’s
26 Legislative Assemblies))
27 (d) The inherent powers of each House are considered “so
28 essential to the authority of a legislative assembly, that it cannot
29 well exist without them; and they are consequently entitled to be
30 regarded as belonging to every such assembly as a necessary
31 incident.” (Cushing’s Legislative Assemblies § 533)
32 (e) The inherent powers of each House authorize it to take all
33 necessary and proper institutional actions that are “recognized by
34 the common parliamentary law.” (Cushing’s Legislative
35 Assemblies § 684)
36 (f) Thus, it is well established that each House is “vested with
37 all the powers and privileges which are necessary and incidental to
38 a free and unobstructed exercise of its appropriate functions.
39 These powers and privileges are derived not from the Constitution;
40 on the contrary, they arise from the very creation of a legislative
41 body, and are founded upon the principle of self-preservation.”
42 (Ex parte McCarthy, 29 Cal. 395, 403 (1866))
43 (g) Under the Nevada Constitution, there are no constitutional
44 provisions establishing a particular method for determining
-
*SR1*

– 19 –
1 whether a member of either House is present at legislative
2 proceedings.
3 (h) The United States Supreme Court has held that when there
4 are no constitutional provisions establishing a particular method
5 for determining whether a member of a legislative house is present
6 at legislative proceedings, “it is therefore within the competency of
7 the house to prescribe any method which shall be reasonably
8 certain to ascertain the fact.” (United States v. Ballin, 144 U.S. 1,
9 6 (1892))
10 (i) The United States Supreme Court has also held that when a
11 legislative house adopts a rule establishing a reasonable method
12 for determining whether a member is present at legislative
13 proceedings, that rule must be given great deference by the courts
14 because:
15 Neither do the advantages or disadvantages, the wisdom or
16 folly, of such a rule present any matters for judicial
17 consideration. With the courts the question is only one of
18 power. The constitution empowers each house to determine
19 its rules of proceedings. It may not by its rules ignore
20 constitutional restraints or violate fundamental rights, and
21 there should be a reasonable relation between the mode or
22 method of proceeding established by the rule and the result
23 which is sought to be attained. But within these limitations
24 all matters of method are open to the determination of the
25 house, and it is no impeachment of the rule to say that some
26 other way would be better, more accurate, or even more just.
27 It is no objection to the validity of a rule that a different one
28 has been prescribed and in force for a length of time. The
29 power to make rules is not one which once exercised is
30 exhausted. It is a continuous power, always subject to be
31 exercised by the house, and, within the limitations
32 suggested, absolute and beyond the challenge of any other
33 body or tribunal.
34
35 (United States v. Ballin, 144 U.S. 1, 5 (1892))
36 7. The Senate hereby exercises its constitutional and inherent
37 powers and privileges and adopts this Rule to:
38 (a) Govern, control and regulate its membership and its
39 internal organization, affairs and management;
40 (b) Ensure its institutional self-protection and self-
41 preservation; and
-
*SR1*

– 20 –
1 (c) Establish a reasonable method for determining whether a
2 member of the Senate is present at legislative proceedings during
3 exceptional circumstances.
4
5 And be it further
6 RESOLVED, That this resolution becomes effective upon
7 adoption.
