Rules of the Senate, the President shall, or any Senator may, call
him or her to order. If a Senator is so called to order, he or she
shall not proceed without leave of the Senate. If such leave is
granted, it must be upon the motion, “That he or she be allowed to
proceed in order,” and the Senator shall confine himself or herself
to the proposal under consideration and avoid personality.
2. Every ruling on points of order made by the President is
subject to appeal, and a discussion of a question of order may be
allowed only upon the appeal of two Senators. In all cases of

intervened before exception to the language was taken.
3. Indecorous conduct or boisterous or unbecoming language
is not permitted in the Senate Chamber.
Rule No. 11.5. Legislative Ethics.
1. Each Legislator is subject, at all times, to the Legislative
Code of Ethical Standards in the Joint Standing Rules of the
Senate and Assembly for the 83rd Session of the Legislature and,
in addition, must determine whether he or she has a conflict of
-
36th Special Session (2025)

– 5 –
interest upon any matter in question before the Legislator. In
determining whether the Legislator has such a conflict of interest,
the Legislator should consider whether the independence of
judgment of a reasonable person in his or her situation upon the
matter in question would be materially affected by the
Legislator’s:
(a) Acceptance of a gift or loan;
(b) Private economic interest; or
(c) Commitment to a member of his or her household or his or
her immediate family.
 In interpreting and applying the provisions of this subsection, it
must be presumed that the independence of judgment of a
reasonable person in the Legislator’s situation would not be
materially affected by the Legislator’s private economic interest or
the Legislator’s commitment to a member of his or her household
or immediate family where the resulting benefit or detriment
accruing to the Legislator, or if the Legislator has a commitment
to a member of his or her household or immediate family,
accruing to those other persons, is not greater than that accruing
to any other member of the general business, profession,
occupation or group that is affected by the matter.
2. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3, if a
Legislator knows he or she has a conflict of interest pursuant to
subsection 1, the Legislator shall make a general disclosure of the
conflict of interest on the record in a meeting of a committee or on
the floor of the Senate, as applicable. Such a disclosure must be
entered:
(a) If the Legislator makes the disclosure in a meeting of a
committee, in the minutes for that meeting.
(b) If the Legislator makes the disclosure on the floor of the
Senate, in the Journal.
3. If, on one or more prior occasions during the current
session of the Legislature, a Legislator has made a general
disclosure of a conflict of interest on the record in a meeting of a
committee or on the floor of the Senate, the Legislator is not
required to make that general disclosure at length again regarding
the same conflict of interest if, when the matter in question arises
on subsequent occasions, the Legislator makes a reference on the
record to the previous disclosure.
4. In determining whether to abstain from voting upon,
advocating or opposing a matter concerning which a Legislator
has a conflict of interest pursuant to subsection 1, the Legislator
should consider whether:
-
36th Special Session (2025)

– 6 –
(a) The conflict impedes his or her independence of judgment;
and
(b) His or her interest is greater than the interests of an entire
class of persons similarly situated.
5. The provisions of this Rule do not under any
circumstances and regardless of any conflict of interest:
(a) Prohibit a Legislator from requesting or introducing a
legislative measure; or
(b) Require a Legislator to take any particular action before or
while requesting or introducing a legislative measure.
6. If a Legislator who is a member of a committee declares on
the record when a vote is to be taken by the committee that he or
she will abstain from voting because of the requirements of this
Rule, the necessary quorum to act upon and the number of votes
necessary to act upon the matter is reduced as though the
Legislator abstaining were not a member of the committee.
7. The standards and procedures set forth in this Rule which
govern whether and to what extent a Senator has a conflict of
interest, should disclose a conflict of interest or should abstain
from voting upon, advocating or opposing a matter concerning
which the Senator has a conflict of interest pursuant to
subsection 1:
(a) Are exclusive and are the only standards and procedures
that apply to Senators with regard to such matters; and
(b) Supersede and preempt all other standards and procedures
with regard to such matters,
 except that this subsection does not exempt any Senators from
the Legislative Code of Ethical Standards in the Joint Standing
Rules.
8. For purposes of this Rule, “immediate family” means a
person who is related to the Legislator by blood, adoption or
marriage within the first degree of consanguinity or affinity.

D. REMOTE-TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS
Rule No. 50. Authorized Use of Remote-Technology Systems in
Exceptional Circumstances.
1. As used in this Rule, “remote-technology system” means
any system or other means of communication that is:
(a) Approved by the Majority Leader and uses any electronic,
digital or other similar technology to enable a member of the
Senate from a remote location to attend, participate, vote and take
any other action in any proceedings of the Senate or the
Committee of the Whole even though the member is not physically
present within the Senate Chambers or at a meeting of the
Committee of the Whole.
(b) Approved by the chair of a committee, other than the
Committee of the Whole, and uses any electronic, digital or other
similar technology to enable a member of the Senate from a
remote location to attend, participate, vote and take any other
action in any proceedings of the committee even though the
member is not physically present at a meeting of the committee.
2. Upon request by a member of the Senate:
(a) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, the
Majority Leader may authorize the member to use a remote-
technology system to attend, participate, vote and take any other
action in any proceedings of the Senate or the Committee of the
Whole if the Majority Leader determines that exceptional
circumstances warrant such use by the member. If the Majority
Leader grants such authorization:
(1) It must be entered in the Journal of the Senate.
(2) A member who uses a remote-technology system to
attend or participate in a proceeding of the Senate may not vote on
any matter on which a vote is taken in that proceeding unless the
member is using the remote-technology system to attend or
participate in the proceeding from a location in this State.
(b) The chair of a committee, other than the Committee of the
Whole, with the approval of the Majority Leader, may authorize
the member to use a remote-technology system to attend,
participate, vote and take any other action in any proceedings of
the committee if the chair and the Majority Leader determine that
exceptional circumstances warrant such use by the member. If the
chair grants such authorization, it must be entered in the records
of the committee.
3. Except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (2) of
paragraph (a) of subsection 2, if a member of the Senate uses a
-

– 18 –
remote-technology system to attend, participate, vote and take any
other action in any proceedings pursuant to this Rule, the member
shall be deemed to be present and in attendance at the proceedings
for all purposes.
4. For the purposes of voting in proceedings of:
(a) The Committee of the Whole, the Secretary of the Senate or
an authorized assistant shall call the roll of each member who is
authorized to use a remote-technology system for the proceedings
and, in accordance with the procedures of the Senate, cause the
member’s vote to be entered into the record for the purposes of the
records of the Committee of the Whole.
(b) A committee, other than the Committee of the Whole, the
committee secretary shall call the roll of each member who is
authorized to use a remote-technology system for the proceedings
and, in accordance with the procedures of the committee, cause
the member’s vote to be entered into the record for the purposes of
the records of the committee.
5. This Rule supersedes, takes precedence and controls over
any other rule, provision or principle of law to the extent of any
conflict with this Rule.
6. The Senate hereby finds and declares that:
(a) The Nevada Constitution invests each House of the
Legislature with certain plenary and exclusive constitutional
powers which may be exercised only by that House and which
cannot be usurped, infringed or impaired by the other House or by
any other branch of Nevada’s State Government. (Heller v.
Legislature, 120 Nev. 456 (2004); Commission on Ethics v. Hardy,
125 Nev. 285 (2009); Mason’s Manual of Legislative Procedure §§
2-3 & 560-564 (2010) (Mason’s Manual))
(b) Section 6 of Article 4 of the Nevada Constitution invests
each House with plenary and exclusive constitutional powers to
determine the rules of its proceedings and to govern, control and
regulate its membership and its internal organization, affairs and
management, expressly providing that: “Each House shall judge
of the qualifications, elections and returns of its own members,
choose its own officers (except the President of the Senate),
determine the rules of its proceedings and may punish its members
for disorderly conduct, and with the concurrence of two thirds of
all the members elected, expel a member.”
(c) In addition to its plenary and exclusive constitutional
powers, each House possesses certain inherent powers of
institutional self-protection and self-preservation to govern,
control and regulate its membership and its internal organization,
-
36th Special Session (2025)

– 19 –
affairs and management. (In re Chapman, 166 U.S. 661, 668
(1897); Mason’s Manual § 2; Luther S. Cushing, Elements of the
Law & Practice of Legislative Assemblies § 533 (1856) (Cushing’s
Legislative Assemblies))
(d) The inherent powers of each House are considered “so
essential to the authority of a legislative assembly, that it cannot
well exist without them; and they are consequently entitled to be
regarded as belonging to every such assembly as a necessary
incident.” (Cushing’s Legislative Assemblies § 533)
(e) The inherent powers of each House authorize it to take all
necessary and proper institutional actions that are “recognized by
the common parliamentary law.” (Cushing’s Legislative
Assemblies § 684)
(f) Thus, it is well established that each House is “vested with
all the powers and privileges which are necessary and incidental to
a free and unobstructed exercise of its appropriate functions.
These powers and privileges are derived not from the Constitution;
on the contrary, they arise from the very creation of a legislative
body, and are founded upon the principle of self-preservation.”
(Ex parte McCarthy, 29 Cal. 395, 403 (1866))
(g) Under the Nevada Constitution, there are no constitutional
provisions establishing a particular method for determining
whether a member of either House is present at legislative
proceedings.
(h) The United States Supreme Court has held that when there
are no constitutional provisions establishing a particular method
for determining whether a member of a legislative house is present
at legislative proceedings, “it is therefore within the competency of
the house to prescribe any method which shall be reasonably
certain to ascertain the fact.” (United States v. Ballin, 144 U.S. 1,
6 (1892))
(i) The United States Supreme Court has also held that when a
legislative house adopts a rule establishing a reasonable method
for determining whether a member is present at legislative
proceedings, that rule must be given great deference by the courts
because:
Neither do the advantages or disadvantages, the wisdom or
folly, of such a rule present any matters for judicial
consideration. With the courts the question is only one of
power. The constitution empowers each house to determine
its rules of proceedings. It may not by its rules ignore
constitutional restraints or violate fundamental rights, and
-
36th Special Session (2025)

– 20 –
there should be a reasonable relation between the mode or
method of proceeding established by the rule and the result
which is sought to be attained. But within these limitations
all matters of method are open to the determination of the
house, and it is no impeachment of the rule to say that some
other way would be better, more accurate, or even more just.
It is no objection to the validity of a rule that a different one
has been prescribed and in force for a length of time. The
power to make rules is not one which once exercised is
exhausted. It is a continuous power, always subject to be
exercised by the house, and, within the limitations
suggested, absolute and beyond the challenge of any other
body or tribunal.
(United States v. Ballin, 144 U.S. 1, 5 (1892))
7. The Senate hereby exercises its constitutional and inherent
powers and privileges and adopts this Rule to:
(a) Govern, control and regulate its membership and its
internal organization, affairs and management;
(b) Ensure its institutional self-protection and self-
preservation; and
(c) Establish a reasonable method for determining whether a
member of the Senate is present at legislative proceedings during
exceptional circumstances.
And be it further
RESOLVED, That this resolution becomes effective upon
adoption.
