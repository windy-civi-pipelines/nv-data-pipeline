~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to the Legislative Department; clarifying that proceeds of sales of
certain items approved by the Director of the Legislative Counsel
Bureau must be deposited in the Legislative Fund; clarifying that the
organization of the Nevada Revised Statutes into titles by the
Legislative Counsel does not constitute a legislative determination for
certain constitutional purposes; placing a certain parcel of land under
the exclusive supervision and control of the Legislature; making an
appropriation; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law: (1) creates the Legislative Fund as a special revenue fund for the use of the
2 Legislative Department of the State Government; (2) provides that money in the Legislative
3 Fund does not revert to the State General Fund; and (3) requires money to be paid out of the
4 Legislative Fund only on claims approved by the Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau
5 or his or her designee. (NRS 218A.150) Existing law further provides that when various items
6 or services provided at the expense of the Legislative Fund are sold, the proceeds from such
7 sales are deposited in the Legislative Fund. (NRS 218F.410-218F.440) Section 2 of this bill
8 clarifies that proceeds received by the Legislative Counsel Bureau from the sales of food or
9 other items in the Legislative Building or any building maintained for the use of the
10 Legislature or the Legislative Counsel Bureau must be similarly deposited in the Legislative
11 Fund. Section 1 of this bill makes a conforming change relating to the petty cash account of
12 the Legislative Counsel Bureau to account for the clarification made by section 2.
13 Existing law reserves the powers and duties relating to the revision of statutes and the
14 compilation, organization, revision and publication of the Nevada Revised Statutes to the
15 Legislative Counsel and the Legal Division of the Legislative Counsel Bureau. (Chapter 220
16 of NRS) Specifically, the Legislative Counsel is: (1) required to classify and arrange the entire
17 body of statute laws in logical order throughout the volumes of the Nevada Revised Statutes
18 to enable subjects of a kindred nature to be placed under one general head; and (2) authorized
19 to create new titles, chapters and sections of the Nevada Revised Statutes as may be required
20 to effectuate the orderly and logical arrangement of the statutes. (NRS 220.120)
21 In prior opinions, the Nevada Supreme Court has recognized that, based on the
22 separation-of-powers provision in the Nevada Constitution, each state office, agency, court or
23 other entity “must have a primary connection to and derive its power to act from one of the
24 three branches of Nevada government.” (Comm’n on Ethics v. Hardy, 125 Nev. 285, 298, 212
25 P.3d 1098, 1107 (2009); Whitehead v. Nev. Comm’n on Jud. Discipline, 110 Nev. 128, 159,

Assembly Amendment No. 18 to Senate Bill No. 2 Page 4
26 906 P.2d 230, 249 (1994); Galloway v. Truesdell, 83 Nev. 13, 19, 422 P.2d 237, 241 (1967)
27 (“The Constitution of the State of Nevada distributes governmental powers into the
28 Legislative, Executive and Judicial departments; and each department is separate from the
29 others.”)) However, in a recent opinion, the Nevada Supreme Court erroneously construed the
30 Legislative Counsel’s decisions in organizing the Nevada Revised Statutes by title,
31 distinguished by subject, as required by law, to be a decision by the Legislature which
32 “indicated its understanding” that certain agencies of the Executive Department of the State
33 Government fall outside “the three departments of state government.” (Nev. Policy Research
34 Institute, Inc. v. Miller, 140 Nev. Adv. Op. 69, 558 P.3d 319, 327 (2024))
35 Section 3 of this bill: (1) clarifies that the Legislative Counsel’s decisions in organizing
36 the Nevada Revised Statutes to effectuate the orderly and logical arrangement of the statutes
37 and to classify the body of statute law by subject matter, as required by law, is not a decision
38 by the Legislature as to which department of the State Government any state office, agency,
39 court or other entity is located or to exclude any state office, agency, court or other entity from
40 the three departments of the State Government; and (2) prohibits construing the organization
41 of the Nevada Revised Statutes in such a manner.
42 Existing law reserves to the Legislature the supervision and control of the property of the
43 Legislative Department and requires title to such property to be held in the name of the
44 Legislature of the State of Nevada. (NRS 331.135) As a result of the completion of the
45 purchase of a certain parcel of land in Carson City, section 4 of this bill includes the parcel
46 among the property for which supervision and control is reserved to the Legislature.
47 Section 4.5 of this bill makes an appropriation for the costs of providing legislative
48 security.
