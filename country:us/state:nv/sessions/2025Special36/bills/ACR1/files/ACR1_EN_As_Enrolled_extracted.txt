ANTI-HARASSMENT POLICY
Rule No. 14. Maintenance of Working Environment;
Procedure for Filing, Investigating and Taking Remedial Action
on Complaints.

Section 31:
1. The Legislature hereby declares that it is the policy of the
Legislature to prohibit any conduct, whether intentional or
unintentional, which results in sexual harassment or other
unlawful harassment based upon any other protected category.
The Legislature intends to maintain a working environment which
is free from sexual harassment and other unlawful harassment.
Each Legislator is responsible to conduct himself or herself in a
manner which will ensure that others are able to work in such an
environment.

Section 32:
2. In accordance with Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of
1964, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e et seq., for the purposes of this Rule,
“sexual harassment” means unwelcome sexual advances, requests
for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual
nature when:
(a) Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or
implicitly a term or condition of a person’s employment;
(b) Submission to or rejection of such conduct by a person is
used as the basis for employment decisions affecting the person;
or
(c) Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably
interfering with a person’s work performance or creating an
intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment.

Section 33:
3. Each Legislator must exercise his or her own good
judgment to avoid engaging in conduct that may be perceived by
others as sexual harassment. The following noninclusive list
provides illustrations of conduct that the Legislature deems to be
inappropriate:
(a) Verbal conduct such as epithets, derogatory comments,
slurs or unwanted sexual advances, invitations or comments;
(b) Visual conduct such as derogatory posters, photography,
cartoons, drawings or gestures;
(c) Physical conduct such as unwanted touching, blocking
normal movement or interfering with the work directed at a person
because of his or her sex; and
(d) Threats and demands to submit to sexual requests to keep a
person’s job or avoid some other loss, and offers of employment
benefits in return for sexual favors.

Section 34:
4. In addition to other prohibited conduct, a complaint may
be brought pursuant to this Rule for engaging in conduct
prohibited by Rule No. 37 of the Joint Rules of the Senate and
Assembly for the 83rd Session of the Legislature when the
prohibited conduct is based on or because of the gender or other
protected category of the person.

Section 35:
5. Retaliation against a person for engaging in protected
activity is prohibited. Retaliation occurs when an adverse action is
taken against a person which is reasonably likely to deter the
person from engaging in the protected activity. Protected activity
includes, without limitation:
(a) Opposing conduct that the person reasonably believes
constitutes sexual harassment or other unlawful harassment;
(b) Filing a complaint about the conduct; or
(c) Testifying, assisting or participating in any manner in an
investigation or other proceeding related to a complaint of sexual
harassment or other unlawful harassment.

Section 36:
6. A Legislator who encounters conduct that the Legislator
believes is sexual harassment, other unlawful harassment,
retaliation or otherwise inconsistent with this policy may file a
written complaint with:
(a) The Speaker of the Assembly;
(b) The Majority Leader of the Senate;
(c) The Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau, if the
complaint involves the conduct of the Speaker of the Assembly or
the Majority Leader of the Senate; or
(d) The reporting system established pursuant to
subsection 11.
 The complaint must include the details of the incident or
incidents, the names of the persons involved and the names of any
witnesses. Unless the Legislative Counsel is the subject of the
complaint, the Legislative Counsel must be informed upon receipt
of a complaint.

Section 37:
7. The Speaker of the Assembly, the Majority Leader of the
Senate or the Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau, as
appropriate, shall cause a discreet and impartial investigation to
be conducted and may, when deemed necessary and appropriate,
assign the complaint to a committee consisting of Legislators of
the appropriate House.

Section 38:
8. If the investigation reveals that sexual harassment, other
unlawful harassment, retaliation or other conduct in violation of
this policy has occurred, appropriate disciplinary or remedial
action, or both will be taken. The appropriate persons will be
-
36th Special Session (2025)
– 9 –
informed when any such action is taken. The Legislature will also
take any action necessary to deter any future harassment.

Section 39:
9. The Legislature encourages a Legislator to report any
incident of sexual harassment, other unlawful harassment,
retaliation or other conduct inconsistent with this policy
immediately so that the complaint can be quickly and fairly
resolved.

Section 40:
10. All Legislators are responsible for adhering to the
provisions of this policy. The prohibitions against engaging in
sexual harassment and other unlawful harassment which are set
forth in this Rule apply to employees, Legislators, lobbyists,
vendors, contractors, customers and any other visitors to the
Legislature.

Section 41:
11. The Legislative Counsel shall establish a reporting system
which allows a person to submit a complaint of a violation of this
Rule with or without identifying himself or herself. Such a
complaint must provide enough details of the incident or incidents
alleged, the names of the persons involved and the names of any
witnesses to allow an appropriate inquiry to occur.

Section 42:
12. This policy does not create any enforceable legal rights in
any person.
And be it further
RESOLVED, That this resolution becomes effective upon
adoption.

ANTI-HARASSMENT POLICY
Rule No. 14. Maintenance of Working Environment;
Procedure for Filing, Investigating and Taking Remedial Action
on Complaints.
1. The Legislature hereby declares that it is the policy of the
Legislature to prohibit any conduct, whether intentional or
unintentional, which results in sexual harassment or other
unlawful harassment based upon any other protected category.
The Legislature intends to maintain a working environment which
is free from sexual harassment and other unlawful harassment.
Each Legislator is responsible to conduct himself or herself in a
manner which will ensure that others are able to work in such an
environment.
2. In accordance with Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of
1964, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e et seq., for the purposes of this Rule,
“sexual harassment” means unwelcome sexual advances, requests
for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual
nature when:
(a) Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or
implicitly a term or condition of a person’s employment;
(b) Submission to or rejection of such conduct by a person is
used as the basis for employment decisions affecting the person;
or
(c) Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably
interfering with a person’s work performance or creating an
intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment.
3. Each Legislator must exercise his or her own good
judgment to avoid engaging in conduct that may be perceived by
others as sexual harassment. The following noninclusive list
provides illustrations of conduct that the Legislature deems to be
inappropriate:
(a) Verbal conduct such as epithets, derogatory comments,
slurs or unwanted sexual advances, invitations or comments;
(b) Visual conduct such as derogatory posters, photography,
cartoons, drawings or gestures;
(c) Physical conduct such as unwanted touching, blocking
normal movement or interfering with the work directed at a person
because of his or her sex; and
(d) Threats and demands to submit to sexual requests to keep a
person’s job or avoid some other loss, and offers of employment
benefits in return for sexual favors.

4. In addition to other prohibited conduct, a complaint may
be brought pursuant to this Rule for engaging in conduct
prohibited by Rule No. 37 of the Joint Rules of the Senate and
Assembly for the 83rd Session of the Legislature when the
prohibited conduct is based on or because of the gender or other
protected category of the person.
5. Retaliation against a person for engaging in protected
activity is prohibited. Retaliation occurs when an adverse action is
taken against a person which is reasonably likely to deter the
person from engaging in the protected activity. Protected activity
includes, without limitation:
(a) Opposing conduct that the person reasonably believes
constitutes sexual harassment or other unlawful harassment;
(b) Filing a complaint about the conduct; or
(c) Testifying, assisting or participating in any manner in an
investigation or other proceeding related to a complaint of sexual
harassment or other unlawful harassment.
6. A Legislator who encounters conduct that the Legislator
believes is sexual harassment, other unlawful harassment,
retaliation or otherwise inconsistent with this policy may file a
written complaint with:
(a) The Speaker of the Assembly;
(b) The Majority Leader of the Senate;
(c) The Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau, if the
complaint involves the conduct of the Speaker of the Assembly or
the Majority Leader of the Senate; or
(d) The reporting system established pursuant to
subsection 11.
 The complaint must include the details of the incident or
incidents, the names of the persons involved and the names of any
witnesses. Unless the Legislative Counsel is the subject of the
complaint, the Legislative Counsel must be informed upon receipt
of a complaint.
7. The Speaker of the Assembly, the Majority Leader of the
Senate or the Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau, as
appropriate, shall cause a discreet and impartial investigation to
be conducted and may, when deemed necessary and appropriate,
assign the complaint to a committee consisting of Legislators of
the appropriate House.
8. If the investigation reveals that sexual harassment, other
unlawful harassment, retaliation or other conduct in violation of
this policy has occurred, appropriate disciplinary or remedial
action, or both will be taken. The appropriate persons will be
-

– 9 –
informed when any such action is taken. The Legislature will also
take any action necessary to deter any future harassment.
9. The Legislature encourages a Legislator to report any
incident of sexual harassment, other unlawful harassment,
retaliation or other conduct inconsistent with this policy
immediately so that the complaint can be quickly and fairly
resolved.
10. All Legislators are responsible for adhering to the
provisions of this policy. The prohibitions against engaging in
sexual harassment and other unlawful harassment which are set
forth in this Rule apply to employees, Legislators, lobbyists,
vendors, contractors, customers and any other visitors to the
Legislature.
11. The Legislative Counsel shall establish a reporting system
which allows a person to submit a complaint of a violation of this
Rule with or without identifying himself or herself. Such a
complaint must provide enough details of the incident or incidents
alleged, the names of the persons involved and the names of any
witnesses to allow an appropriate inquiry to occur.
12. This policy does not create any enforceable legal rights in
any person.
And be it further
RESOLVED, That this resolution becomes effective upon
adoption.
