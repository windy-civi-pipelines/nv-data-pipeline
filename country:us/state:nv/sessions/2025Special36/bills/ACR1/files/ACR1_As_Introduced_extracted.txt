1 ANTI-HARASSMENT POLICY
2
3 Rule No. 14. Maintenance of Working Environment;
4 Procedure for Filing, Investigating and Taking Remedial Action
5 on Complaints.
6 1. The Legislature hereby declares that it is the policy of the
7 Legislature to prohibit any conduct, whether intentional or
8 unintentional, which results in sexual harassment or other
9 unlawful harassment based upon any other protected category.
10 The Legislature intends to maintain a working environment which
11 is free from sexual harassment and other unlawful harassment.
12 Each Legislator is responsible to conduct himself or herself in a
13 manner which will ensure that others are able to work in such an
14 environment.
15 2. In accordance with Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of
16 1964, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e et seq., for the purposes of this Rule,
17 “sexual harassment” means unwelcome sexual advances, requests
18 for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual
19 nature when:
20 (a) Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or
21 implicitly a term or condition of a person’s employment;
22 (b) Submission to or rejection of such conduct by a person is
23 used as the basis for employment decisions affecting the person;
24 or
25 (c) Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably
26 interfering with a person’s work performance or creating an
27 intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment.
28 3. Each Legislator must exercise his or her own good
29 judgment to avoid engaging in conduct that may be perceived by
30 others as sexual harassment. The following noninclusive list
31 provides illustrations of conduct that the Legislature deems to be
32 inappropriate:
33 (a) Verbal conduct such as epithets, derogatory comments,
34 slurs or unwanted sexual advances, invitations or comments;
35 (b) Visual conduct such as derogatory posters, photography,
36 cartoons, drawings or gestures;
37 (c) Physical conduct such as unwanted touching, blocking
38 normal movement or interfering with the work directed at a person
39 because of his or her sex; and
40 (d) Threats and demands to submit to sexual requests to keep a
41 person’s job or avoid some other loss, and offers of employment
42 benefits in return for sexual favors.
43 4. In addition to other prohibited conduct, a complaint may
44 be brought pursuant to this Rule for engaging in conduct
45 prohibited by Rule No. 37 of the Joint Rules of the Senate and
-
*ACR1*
– 8 –
1 Assembly for the 83rd Session of the Legislature when the
2 prohibited conduct is based on or because of the gender or other
3 protected category of the person.
4 5. Retaliation against a person for engaging in protected
5 activity is prohibited. Retaliation occurs when an adverse action is
6 taken against a person which is reasonably likely to deter the
7 person from engaging in the protected activity. Protected activity
8 includes, without limitation:
9 (a) Opposing conduct that the person reasonably believes
10 constitutes sexual harassment or other unlawful harassment;
11 (b) Filing a complaint about the conduct; or
12 (c) Testifying, assisting or participating in any manner in an
13 investigation or other proceeding related to a complaint of sexual
14 harassment or other unlawful harassment.
15 6. A Legislator who encounters conduct that the Legislator
16 believes is sexual harassment, other unlawful harassment,
17 retaliation or otherwise inconsistent with this policy may file a
18 written complaint with:
19 (a) The Speaker of the Assembly;
20 (b) The Majority Leader of the Senate;
21 (c) The Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau, if the
22 complaint involves the conduct of the Speaker of the Assembly or
23 the Majority Leader of the Senate; or
24 (d) The reporting system established pursuant to
25 subsection 11.
26  The complaint must include the details of the incident or
27 incidents, the names of the persons involved and the names of any
28 witnesses. Unless the Legislative Counsel is the subject of the
29 complaint, the Legislative Counsel must be informed upon receipt
30 of a complaint.
31 7. The Speaker of the Assembly, the Majority Leader of the
32 Senate or the Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau, as
33 appropriate, shall cause a discreet and impartial investigation to
34 be conducted and may, when deemed necessary and appropriate,
35 assign the complaint to a committee consisting of Legislators of
36 the appropriate House.
37 8. If the investigation reveals that sexual harassment, other
38 unlawful harassment, retaliation or other conduct in violation of
39 this policy has occurred, appropriate disciplinary or remedial
40 action, or both will be taken. The appropriate persons will be
41 informed when any such action is taken. The Legislature will also
42 take any action necessary to deter any future harassment.
43 9. The Legislature encourages a Legislator to report any
44 incident of sexual harassment, other unlawful harassment,
45 retaliation or other conduct inconsistent with this policy
-
*ACR1*
– 9 –
1 immediately so that the complaint can be quickly and fairly
2 resolved.
3 10. All Legislators are responsible for adhering to the
4 provisions of this policy. The prohibitions against engaging in
5 sexual harassment and other unlawful harassment which are set
6 forth in this Rule apply to employees, Legislators, lobbyists,
7 vendors, contractors, customers and any other visitors to the
8 Legislature.
9 11. The Legislative Counsel shall establish a reporting system
10 which allows a person to submit a complaint of a violation of this
11 Rule with or without identifying himself or herself. Such a
12 complaint must provide enough details of the incident or incidents
13 alleged, the names of the persons involved and the names of any
14 witnesses to allow an appropriate inquiry to occur.
15 12. This policy does not create any enforceable legal rights in
16 any person.
17
18 And be it further
19 RESOLVED, That this resolution becomes effective upon
20 adoption.

1 ANTI-HARASSMENT POLICY
2
3 Rule No. 14. Maintenance of Working Environment;
4 Procedure for Filing, Investigating and Taking Remedial Action
5 on Complaints.
6 1. The Legislature hereby declares that it is the policy of the
7 Legislature to prohibit any conduct, whether intentional or
8 unintentional, which results in sexual harassment or other
9 unlawful harassment based upon any other protected category.
10 The Legislature intends to maintain a working environment which
11 is free from sexual harassment and other unlawful harassment.
12 Each Legislator is responsible to conduct himself or herself in a
13 manner which will ensure that others are able to work in such an
14 environment.
15 2. In accordance with Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of
16 1964, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e et seq., for the purposes of this Rule,
17 “sexual harassment” means unwelcome sexual advances, requests
18 for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual
19 nature when:
20 (a) Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or
21 implicitly a term or condition of a person’s employment;
22 (b) Submission to or rejection of such conduct by a person is
23 used as the basis for employment decisions affecting the person;
24 or
25 (c) Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably
26 interfering with a person’s work performance or creating an
27 intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment.
28 3. Each Legislator must exercise his or her own good
29 judgment to avoid engaging in conduct that may be perceived by
30 others as sexual harassment. The following noninclusive list
31 provides illustrations of conduct that the Legislature deems to be
32 inappropriate:
33 (a) Verbal conduct such as epithets, derogatory comments,
34 slurs or unwanted sexual advances, invitations or comments;
35 (b) Visual conduct such as derogatory posters, photography,
36 cartoons, drawings or gestures;
37 (c) Physical conduct such as unwanted touching, blocking
38 normal movement or interfering with the work directed at a person
39 because of his or her sex; and
40 (d) Threats and demands to submit to sexual requests to keep a
41 person’s job or avoid some other loss, and offers of employment
42 benefits in return for sexual favors.
43 4. In addition to other prohibited conduct, a complaint may
44 be brought pursuant to this Rule for engaging in conduct
45 prohibited by Rule No. 37 of the Joint Rules of the Senate and
-
*ACR1*

– 8 –
1 Assembly for the 83rd Session of the Legislature when the
2 prohibited conduct is based on or because of the gender or other
3 protected category of the person.
4 5. Retaliation against a person for engaging in protected
5 activity is prohibited. Retaliation occurs when an adverse action is
6 taken against a person which is reasonably likely to deter the
7 person from engaging in the protected activity. Protected activity
8 includes, without limitation:
9 (a) Opposing conduct that the person reasonably believes
10 constitutes sexual harassment or other unlawful harassment;
11 (b) Filing a complaint about the conduct; or
12 (c) Testifying, assisting or participating in any manner in an
13 investigation or other proceeding related to a complaint of sexual
14 harassment or other unlawful harassment.
15 6. A Legislator who encounters conduct that the Legislator
16 believes is sexual harassment, other unlawful harassment,
17 retaliation or otherwise inconsistent with this policy may file a
18 written complaint with:
19 (a) The Speaker of the Assembly;
20 (b) The Majority Leader of the Senate;
21 (c) The Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau, if the
22 complaint involves the conduct of the Speaker of the Assembly or
23 the Majority Leader of the Senate; or
24 (d) The reporting system established pursuant to
25 subsection 11.
26  The complaint must include the details of the incident or
27 incidents, the names of the persons involved and the names of any
28 witnesses. Unless the Legislative Counsel is the subject of the
29 complaint, the Legislative Counsel must be informed upon receipt
30 of a complaint.
31 7. The Speaker of the Assembly, the Majority Leader of the
32 Senate or the Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau, as
33 appropriate, shall cause a discreet and impartial investigation to
34 be conducted and may, when deemed necessary and appropriate,
35 assign the complaint to a committee consisting of Legislators of
36 the appropriate House.
37 8. If the investigation reveals that sexual harassment, other
38 unlawful harassment, retaliation or other conduct in violation of
39 this policy has occurred, appropriate disciplinary or remedial
40 action, or both will be taken. The appropriate persons will be
41 informed when any such action is taken. The Legislature will also
42 take any action necessary to deter any future harassment.
43 9. The Legislature encourages a Legislator to report any
44 incident of sexual harassment, other unlawful harassment,
45 retaliation or other conduct inconsistent with this policy
-
*ACR1*

– 9 –
1 immediately so that the complaint can be quickly and fairly
2 resolved.
3 10. All Legislators are responsible for adhering to the
4 provisions of this policy. The prohibitions against engaging in
5 sexual harassment and other unlawful harassment which are set
6 forth in this Rule apply to employees, Legislators, lobbyists,
7 vendors, contractors, customers and any other visitors to the
8 Legislature.
9 11. The Legislative Counsel shall establish a reporting system
10 which allows a person to submit a complaint of a violation of this
11 Rule with or without identifying himself or herself. Such a
12 complaint must provide enough details of the incident or incidents
13 alleged, the names of the persons involved and the names of any
14 witnesses to allow an appropriate inquiry to occur.
15 12. This policy does not create any enforceable legal rights in
16 any person.
17
18 And be it further
19 RESOLVED, That this resolution becomes effective upon
20 adoption.
