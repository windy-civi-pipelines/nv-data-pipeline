Assembly Amendment No. 10 to Assembly Bill No. 5 Page 3
If this amendment is adopted, the Legislative Counsel᾿s Digest will be changed
as follows:
1 Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
2 Existing law establishes a program for the issuance of transferable tax credits by the
3 Office of Economic Development to the production company of a motion picture or other
4 qualified production, based upon qualified direct production expenditures made for the
5 purchase of personal property or services from a Nevada business. (NRS 360.758-360.7598)
6 This bill revises provisions governing these transferable tax credits and enacts the Nevada
7 Studio Infrastructure Jobs and Workforce Training Act to authorize film infrastructure
8 transferable tax credits for qualified productions produced at the site of the Summerlin
9 Production Studios Project.
10 Sections 1-20 of this bill enact the Nevada Studio Infrastructure Jobs and Workforce
11 Training Act, which provides film infrastructure transferable tax credits for production
12 companies located within the Summerlin Production Studios Project, as defined in section 9.
13 Section 10 requires the Office of Economic Development to enter into a development
14 agreement with the lead participant of the Project to establish: (1) certain criteria that the
15 Project is required to satisfy for film infrastructure transferable tax credits to be authorized for
16 qualified productions at the Project; and (2) certain requirements for new capital investment in
17 this State and the generation of direct production expenditures in this State, which the Project
18 must meet, with certain exceptions, to avoid penalties specified in section 10. Section 11: (1)
19 authorizes production companies located at the Project to apply, on or after December 1,
20 2026, to the Office for film infrastructure transferable tax credits for qualified productions
21 produced, in whole or in part, at the Project; and (2) authorizes such credits to be used against
22 the modified business tax, insurance premium tax or gaming license fee, or any combination
23 of these taxes and fees. Section 12 establishes the qualified direct production expenditures
24 which are the basis for calculating the amount of film infrastructure transferable tax credits,
25 including, without limitation: (1) purchases, rentals or leases of property or services from a
26 Nevada business; (2) wages and fringe benefits paid to employees who are Nevada residents
27 or other personnel for labor or services provided in this State on the qualified production; and
28 (3) amounts paid to service providers for the services of certain persons on the qualified
29 production. Section 13 establishes requirements for the employment of Nevada residents as
30 below-the-line employees of qualified productions. Section 14 provides that the base amount
31 of film infrastructure transferable tax credits is 30 percent of the amount of qualified direct
32 production expenditures calculated under section 12, with [certain reductions] no credits
33 issued if the production company does not satisfy certain criteria for work opportunities [to]
34 for members of traditionally underrepresented groups. Section 15: (1) limits the total amount
35 of film infrastructure transferable tax credits issued pursuant to sections 1-20 to $95,000,000
36 for each fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2029; and (2) prohibits the approval of an
37 application for film infrastructure transferable tax credits if the application is submitted in a
38 fiscal year that begins on or after July 1, 2044. Section 16 requires a production company to:
39 (1) commence principal photography within a certain period of time after the Office approves
40 an application for a certificate of eligibility for film infrastructure transferable tax credits; (2)
41 complete the qualified production within 18 months after the date of commencement of
42 principal photography, except that the Office may extend this period for not more than 6
43 months; and (3) submit certain required information within the required period. Section 17
44 requires a production company to repay film infrastructure transferable tax credits under
45 certain circumstances. Section 19 requires the lead participant in the Project to submit certain
46 reports to the Governor, the Legislature and the Office. Section 20 requires certain reports to
47 be made to the Legislature concerning film infrastructure transferable tax credits.
48 Sections 23-32 of this bill make various changes to the existing law governing the
49 noninfrastructure transferable tax credits for motion picture and other qualified productions.

Assembly Amendment No. 10 to Assembly Bill No. 5 Page 4
50 (NRS 360.758-360.7598) Section 24 changes references to “extras” in a qualification
51 production to “background actors.” Section 25: (1) provides that digital media productions are
52 qualified productions for the purposes of eligibility for film infrastructure transferable tax
53 credits and noninfrastructure transferable tax credits; and (2) clarifies that media productions
54 solely produced for social media are not eligible for such transferable tax credits. Section 26
55 revises the criteria to be eligible for noninfrastructure transferable tax credits to be the same as
56 the criteria for film infrastructure transferable tax credits by: (1) removing the requirement
57 that a certain percentage of direct production expenditures be incurred in this State and,
58 instead, requiring that at least 50 percent of the total principal photography days of the
59 qualified production take place in this State or a certain amount of qualified direct production
60 expenditures be incurred in this State; and (2) requiring a production company to have a
61 workforce plan that establishes certain goals and provide to the Office a final assessment of
62 whether the production company met or made a good faith effort to meet those goals. Section
63 22 of this bill applies to applicants for noninfrastructure transferable tax credits the same
64 requirements for the employment of Nevada residents as below-the-line personnel that apply
65 to applicants for film infrastructure transferable tax credits. Section 27 revises the
66 expenditures and costs that may serve as a basis for noninfrastructure transferable tax credits.
67 Section 28: (1) increases the base amount of transferable tax credits from 15 percent of the
68 qualified direct production expenditures to 30 percent of the qualified direct production
69 expenditures, for an application submitted in each fiscal year beginning on or after July 1,
70 2029, and ending before July 1, 2044; and (2) provides [for certain reductions to that base
71 amount during that period.] that no credits may be issued if the production company does
72 not satisfy certain criteria for work opportunities for members of traditionally
73 underrepresented groups. Section 29 makes certain provisions of existing law relating to the
74 calculation of noninfrastructure transferable tax credits inapplicable for the period beginning
75 on July 1, 2029, and ending on June 30, 2044. Section 30 temporarily increases from
76 $10,000,000 to $25,000,000 the total amount of noninfrastructure transferable tax credits for
77 motion picture and other qualified productions that may be issued under the existing program
78 for each fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2029, until June 30, 2044. Sections 31 and
79 32 make conforming changes so that noninfrastructure transferable tax credits are
80 administered and reported in the same manner as film infrastructure transferable tax credits.
81 Section 18 requires the Clark County Board of County Commissioners to create a
82 production studio entertainment district for the purpose of enhancing early childhood
83 education opportunities, including prekindergarten, for children in Clark County. Under
84 section 18, the boundaries of the district are required to be entirely within the unincorporated
85 areas of Clark County and include only parcels of land that are located within the boundaries
86 of the Summerlin Production Studios Project. Section 18 requires certain taxes on transient
87 lodging, certain property taxes and certain sales and use taxes imposed in the district to be
88 pledged and distributed to the Clark County School District and used by the Clark County
89 School District solely for the purposes of prekindergarten programs in the Clark County
90 School District. Finally, section 18 requires the Clark County School District to submit annual
91 reports to the Office concerning the use of money distributed to Clark County School District
92 under section 18.
93 Sections 33-40 of this bill establish a program to provide grants to certain organizations
94 that provide education and vocational training for workforce development for the production
95 of motion pictures and other qualified productions. Section 38 establishes the Account for
96 Nevada Film, Media and Related Technology Education and Vocational Training for the
97 purpose of allocating money to certain entities and organizations that provide education and
98 vocational training for such workforce development. Sections 11 and 26 require [a production
99 company that is issued transferable tax credits for a qualified production to pay to] the Office
100 to cause the transfer to the Account an amount of money equal to 1 percentage point of the
101 percent of qualified direct production expenditures used to calculate the amount of
102 transferable tax credits issued to the qualified production, and [requires the Office to deposit

Assembly Amendment No. 10 to Assembly Bill No. 5 Page 5
103 that money with the State Treasurer for credit to the Account.] to reduce the amount of
104 transferable tax credits issued to the production company by that amount of money.
105 Section 39 creates and provides for the composition of the Board for Nevada Film, Media and
106 Related Technology Education and Vocational Training within the Office of Economic
107 Development. Section 40: (1) requires the Board to establish the procedure for a person or
108 entity to apply for a grant of money from the Account, the criteria to be used to determine
109 whether to approve an application for a grant from the Account to an applicant and the
110 requirements for reports by recipients of such grants concerning the use of the grants; and (2)
111 prohibits the making of a grant from the Account unless the Board approves the application
112 for the grant.
Section 10 of Assembly Bill No. 5 is hereby amended as follows:

29 investment in the element of the Project for which the requirement for capital
30 investment was not met not later than 2 years after the end of the period for which
31 the requirement for capital investment was not met, in an amount necessary to

46 (2) If the requirement for capital investment which was not met is satisfied
47 more than 1 year, but not later than 2 years, after the expiration of the cure period,
48 70 percent of the amount of the penalty, and the lien securing the payment of the
49 penalty, must be discharged.
50 (3) If the requirement for capital investment which was not met is satisfied
51 more than 2 years, but not later than 3 years, after the expiration of the cure period,
52 50 percent of the amount of the penalty, and the lien securing the payment of the
53 penalty, must be discharged.

Assembly Amendment No. 10 to Assembly Bill No. 5 Page 8
1 (4) If the requirement for capital investment which was not met is satisfied

4 penalty, must be discharged.
5 (5) If the requirement for capital investment which was not met is satisfied
6 more than 4 years, but not later than 5 years, after the expiration of the cure period,
7 10 percent of the amount of the penalty, and the lien securing the payment of the

12 undeveloped or has not been developed in accordance with the findings and intent
13 of the Legislature as expressed in sections 2 and 3 of this act.
14 (b) May not be recorded on any completed portion of the Project.
15 (c) May be modified, replaced or reissued to secure payment of the most
16 current amount of any penalty imposed pursuant to subsection 3 but any such lien is

18 5. If the Office determines that the amount of direct production expenditures
19 is less than $150,000,000 in any fiscal year commencing on or after July 1, 2029,
20 and before July 1, 2044, the Office must notify the Project, in writing, of its
21 determination and impose a penalty on the Project in an amount equal to the lesser
22 of $10,000,000 or the amount determined by:
23 (a) Calculating 50 percent of the sum of the film infrastructure transferable tax
24 credits authorized for approval pursuant to section 15 of this act for that fiscal year
25 and the immediately preceding fiscal year;
26 (b) Calculating a percentage by dividing the difference between the
27 $150,000,000 and the actual amount, as determined by the Office, of direct
28 production expenditures, by $150,000,000; and
29 (c) Multiplying the percentage calculated pursuant to paragraph (b) by the
30 amount calculated pursuant to paragraph (a).
31  Any penalty paid pursuant to this subsection must be applied to reduce the
32 amount of any penalty imposed pursuant to subsection 6.
33 6. If the Office determines that the Project has not met a requirement for
34 direct production expenditures included in the development agreement pursuant to
35 subparagraph (4) of paragraph (a) of subsection 1, the Project must pay to the
36 Office a penalty in an amount determined as follows:
37 (a) If the actual amount of direct production expenditures is more than 2
38 percent and not more than 5 percent less than the applicable requirement for direct

42 (b) If the actual amount of direct production expenditures is more than 5
43 percent and not more than 10 percent less than the applicable requirement for direct

46 $5,000,000.
47 (c) If the actual amount of direct production expenditures is more than 10
48 percent and not more than 20 percent less than the applicable requirement for direct
49 production expenditures included in the development agreement pursuant to
50 subparagraph (4) of paragraph (a) of subsection 1, a penalty in the amount of
51 $10,000,000.
52 (d) If the actual amount of direct production expenditures is more than 20
53 percent and not more than 30 percent less than the applicable requirement for direct

2 subparagraph (4) of paragraph (a) of subsection 1, a penalty in the amount of
3 $20,000,000.
4 (e) If the actual amount of direct production expenditures is more than 30
5 percent and not more than 40 percent less than the applicable requirement for direct

18 7. The Office may reduce, or waive, any penalty imposed pursuant to
19 subsections 3 to 6, inclusive, if, upon written request of the lead participant, the
20 Office determines that the failure to meet a requirement for which a penalty may be
21 imposed was caused by extraordinary circumstances beyond the control of the
22 Project and reasonable, documented and good-faith efforts were made to satisfy the
23 requirement. For the purposes of this subsection, “extraordinary circumstances”:
24 (a) Means natural disasters, labor strikes, significant disruptions in material
25 supply chains, substantial economic or geopolitical shocks, government-mandated
26 closures, delays in obtaining any approval of a governmental entity needed for the
27 Project that are not caused by the Project or other events in the nature of force
28 majeure that materially impair the ability to carry out development and construction
29 activities.
30 (b) Does not include ordinary market fluctuations, internal project scheduling
31 decisions or changes in business strategy.
32 8. Before taking any action or declining any request for an action authorized
33 by subsection 7, the Executive Director of the Office shall:
34 (a) Consider any documentation submitted by the production company related
35 to the action under consideration; and
36 (b) Make the following determinations in writing:
37 (1) That good cause exists to take such action; and
38 (2) That the action is reasonable based on the circumstances of the
39 underlying incident on which the reduction or withholding of film infrastructure
40 transferable tax credits authorized pursuant to subsection 4 is based.
41 9. Any penalty paid to the Office pursuant to subsections 3 to 6, inclusive,
42 must be deposited with the State Treasurer for credit to the State General Fund.
43 10. The Office shall not approve any abatement, partial abatement or
44 exemption from taxes, or any other incentive for economic development, other than
45 film infrastructure transferable tax credits pursuant to sections 4 to 20, inclusive, of
46 this act or noninfrastructure transferable tax credits pursuant to NRS 360.758 to
47 360.7598, inclusive, for the Summerlin Production Studios Project if the Project has

50 (a) “Direct production expenditures” means expenditures in this State:
51 (1) By a production company that is affiliated with the lead participant and
52 is producing, in whole or in part, a qualified production at the Project;

Assembly Amendment No. 10 to Assembly Bill No. 5 Page 10
1 (2) That are direct expenditures on a qualified production that is produced,
2 in whole or in part, at the Project; and
3 (3) That meet the criteria to be a qualified direct production expenditure
4 pursuant to subsection 1 of section 12 of this act, regardless of whether the
5 production company applies for or receives film transferable tax credits for the
6 qualified production.
7 (b) “Hotel” means a building occupied or intended to be occupied for
8 compensation, as the temporary residence for transient guests, primarily persons
9 who have residence elsewhere. A hotel has an interior hall and lobby with access to
