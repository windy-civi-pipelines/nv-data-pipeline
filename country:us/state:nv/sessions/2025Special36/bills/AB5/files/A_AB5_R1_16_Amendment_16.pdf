20 credits authorized for approval pursuant to section 15 of this act for that fiscal year
21 and the immediately preceding fiscal year;
22 (b) Calculating a percentage by dividing the difference between the

15 7. The Office may reduce, or waive, any penalty imposed pursuant to
16 subsections 3 to 6, inclusive, if, upon written request of the lead participant, the
17 Office determines that the failure to meet a requirement for which a penalty may be
18 imposed was caused by extraordinary circumstances beyond the control of the

20 requirement. For the purposes of this subsection, “extraordinary circumstances”:
21 (a) Means natural disasters, labor strikes, significant disruptions in material
22 supply chains, substantial economic or geopolitical shocks, government-mandated

43 this act or noninfrastructure transferable tax credits pursuant to NRS 360.758 to
