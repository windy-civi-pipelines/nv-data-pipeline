to certain entities and organizations that provide
education and vocational training to develop a workforce
for the production of qualified productions in this State;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes a program for the issuance of transferable tax credits
2 by the Office of Economic Development to the production company of a motion
3 picture or other qualified production, based upon qualified direct production
4 expenditures made for the purchase of personal property or services from a Nevada
5 business. (NRS 360.758-360.7598) This bill revises provisions governing these
6 transferable tax credits and enacts the Nevada Studio Infrastructure Jobs and
7 Workforce Training Act to authorize film infrastructure transferable tax credits for
8 qualified productions produced at the site of the Summerlin Production Studios
9 Project.
10 Sections 1-20 of this bill enact the Nevada Studio Infrastructure Jobs and
11 Workforce Training Act, which provides film infrastructure transferable tax credits
12 for production companies located within the Summerlin Production Studios Project,
13 as defined in section 9. Section 10 requires the Office of Economic Development
14 to enter into a development agreement with the lead participant of the Project to
15 establish: (1) certain criteria that the Project is required to satisfy for film
16 infrastructure transferable tax credits to be authorized for qualified productions at
17 the Project; and (2) certain requirements for new capital investment in this State
18 and the generation of direct production expenditures in this State, which the Project
19 must meet, with certain exceptions, to avoid penalties specified in section 10.
20 Section 11: (1) authorizes production companies located at the Project to apply, on
21 or after December 1, 2026, to the Office for film infrastructure transferable tax
22 credits for qualified productions produced, in whole or in part, at the Project; and
23 (2) authorizes such credits to be used against the modified business tax, insurance
24 premium tax or gaming license fee, or any combination of these taxes and fees.
25 Section 12 establishes the qualified direct production expenditures which are the
26 basis for calculating the amount of film infrastructure transferable tax credits,
27 including, without limitation: (1) purchases, rentals or leases of property or services
28 from a Nevada business; (2) wages and fringe benefits paid to employees who are
29 Nevada residents or other personnel for labor or services provided in this State on
30 the qualified production; and (3) amounts paid to service providers for the services
31 of certain persons on the qualified production. Section 13 establishes requirements
32 for the employment of Nevada residents as below-the-line employees of qualified
33 productions. Section 14 provides that the base amount of film infrastructure
34 transferable tax credits is 30 percent of the amount of qualified direct production
35 expenditures calculated under section 12, with no credits issued if the production
36 company does not satisfy certain criteria for work opportunities for members of
37 traditionally underrepresented groups. Section 15: (1) limits the total amount of
38 film infrastructure transferable tax credits issued pursuant to sections 1-20 to
39 $95,000,000 for each fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2029; and (2)
40 prohibits the approval of an application for film infrastructure transferable tax
41 credits if the application is submitted in a fiscal year that begins on or after July 1,
42 2044. Section 16 requires a production company to: (1) commence principal
43 photography within a certain period of time after the Office approves an application
44 for a certificate of eligibility for film infrastructure transferable tax credits; (2)
45 complete the qualified production within 18 months after the date of
46 commencement of principal photography, except that the Office may extend this
47 period for not more than 6 months; and (3) submit certain required information
48 within the required period. Section 17 requires a production company to repay film
-

– 3 –
49 infrastructure transferable tax credits under certain circumstances. Section 19
50 requires the lead participant in the Project to submit certain reports to the Governor,
51 the Legislature and the Office. Section 20 requires certain reports to be made to the
52 Legislature concerning film infrastructure transferable tax credits.
53 Sections 23-32 of this bill make various changes to the existing law governing
54 the noninfrastructure transferable tax credits for motion picture and other qualified
55 productions. (NRS 360.758-360.7598) Section 24 changes references to “extras” in
56 a qualification production to “background actors.” Section 25: (1) provides that
57 digital media productions are qualified productions for the purposes of eligibility
58 for film infrastructure transferable tax credits and noninfrastructure transferable tax
59 credits; and (2) clarifies that media productions solely produced for social media
60 are not eligible for such transferable tax credits. Section 26 revises the criteria to be
61 eligible for noninfrastructure transferable tax credits to be the same as the criteria
62 for film infrastructure transferable tax credits by: (1) removing the requirement that
63 a certain percentage of direct production expenditures be incurred in this State and,
64 instead, requiring that at least 50 percent of the total principal photography days of
65 the qualified production take place in this State or a certain amount of qualified
66 direct production expenditures be incurred in this State; and (2) requiring a
67 production company to have a workforce plan that establishes certain goals and
68 provide to the Office a final assessment of whether the production company met or
69 made a good faith effort to meet those goals. Section 22 of this bill applies to
70 applicants for noninfrastructure transferable tax credits the same requirements for
71 the employment of Nevada residents as below-the-line personnel that apply to
72 applicants for film infrastructure transferable tax credits. Section 27 revises the
73 expenditures and costs that may serve as a basis for noninfrastructure transferable
74 tax credits. Section 28: (1) increases the base amount of transferable tax credits
75 from 15 percent of the qualified direct production expenditures to 30 percent of the
76 qualified direct production expenditures, for an application submitted in each fiscal
77 year beginning on or after July 1, 2029, and ending before July 1, 2044; and (2)
78 provides that no credits may be issued if the production company does not satisfy
79 certain criteria for work opportunities for members of traditionally
80 underrepresented groups. Section 29 makes certain provisions of existing law
81 relating to the calculation of noninfrastructure transferable tax credits inapplicable
82 for the period beginning on July 1, 2029, and ending on June 30, 2044. Section 30
83 temporarily increases from $10,000,000 to $25,000,000 the total amount of
84 noninfrastructure transferable tax credits for motion picture and other qualified
85 productions that may be issued under the existing program for each fiscal year
86 beginning on or after July 1, 2029, until June 30, 2044. Sections 31 and 32 make
87 conforming changes so that noninfrastructure transferable tax credits are
88 administered and reported in the same manner as film infrastructure transferable tax
89 credits.
90 Section 18 requires the Clark County Board of County Commissioners to
91 create a production studio entertainment district for the purpose of enhancing early
92 childhood education opportunities, including prekindergarten, for children in Clark
93 County. Under section 18, the boundaries of the district are required to be entirely
94 within the unincorporated areas of Clark County and include only parcels of land
95 that are located within the boundaries of the Summerlin Production Studios Project.
96 Section 18 requires certain taxes on transient lodging, certain property taxes and
97 certain sales and use taxes imposed in the district to be pledged and distributed to
98 the Clark County School District and used by the Clark County School District
99 solely for the purposes of prekindergarten programs in the Clark County School
100 District. Finally, section 18 requires the Clark County School District to submit
101 annual reports to the Office concerning the use of money distributed to Clark
102 County School District under section 18.

103 Sections 33-40 of this bill establish a program to provide grants to certain
104 organizations that provide education and vocational training for workforce
105 development for the production of motion pictures and other qualified productions.
106 Section 38 establishes the Account for Nevada Film, Media and Related
107 Technology Education and Vocational Training for the purpose of allocating
108 money to certain entities and organizations that provide education and vocational
109 training for such workforce development. Sections 11 and 26 require the Office to
110 cause the transfer to the Account an amount of money equal to 1 percentage point
111 of the percent of qualified direct production expenditures used to calculate the
112 amount of transferable tax credits issued to the qualified production, and to reduce
113 the amount of transferable tax credits issued to the production company by that
114 amount of money. Section 39 creates and provides for the composition of the
115 Board for Nevada Film, Media and Related Technology Education and Vocational
116 Training within the Office of Economic Development. Section 40: (1) requires the
117 Board to establish the procedure for a person or entity to apply for a grant of money
118 from the Account, the criteria to be used to determine whether to approve an
119 application for a grant from the Account to an applicant and the requirements for
120 reports by recipients of such grants concerning the use of the grants; and (2)
121 prohibits the making of a grant from the Account unless the Board approves the
122 application for the grant.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Sections 1 to 20, inclusive, of this act may be cited
2 as the Nevada Studio Infrastructure Jobs and Workforce Training
3 Act.
4 Sec. 2. 1. The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
5 (a) The Las Vegas Metropolitan Area is the largest metropolitan
6 area in this State and has a site available to be developed to create
7 large-scale facilities for the location of companies that produce
8 motion pictures, television programs and other qualified productions
9 in this State. The establishment of such a studio campus will create
10 jobs in Nevada’s creative industries and diversify the economy of
11 this State.
12 (b) The Las Vegas Metropolitan Area possesses unique
13 geographic, economic and resource advantages that make it
14 especially suitable for a project of this magnitude. Because of these
15 unique local conditions, it is necessary to enact a law of local and
16 special application to promote and secure the benefits of a large-
17 scale film and media production development in Southern Nevada
18 for the benefit of the entire State.
19 (c) Because of these special characteristics and circumstances in
20 Southern Nevada, a general law cannot be made applicable to
21 achieve the purposes of this Act and a law of local and special
22 application is necessary to promote and secure the advantages of the
23 local and special characteristics and circumstances within the Las
24 Vegas Metropolitan Area.
-

1 2. The Legislature further finds and declares that the content
2 production industry has presented an ambitious and visionary plan
3 for all of Southern Nevada, which leverages the region’s unique
4 geographic assets, economic capabilities and infrastructural
5 advantages. The industry’s vision will promote the generation of
6 thousands of high-quality, high-paying jobs, billions of dollars in
7 incremental capital investments and billions more in new economic
8 output and ongoing spending. This plan transcends the development
9 of a mere studio complex, proposing instead a dynamic production
10 campus that is intended to serve as the nucleus for a robust,
11 sustainable industrial cluster. The Legislature recognizes that
12 realizing this vision depends fundamentally upon a collaborative
13 public-private partnership, wherein the State’s commitment,
14 provided through transferable tax credits, creates leverage that
15 significantly multiplies the benefits accruing to this State. In
16 entering this partnership, the Legislature affirms its clear and
17 unwavering expectation that if the industry benefits from the State’s
18 contribution of transferable tax credits, the industry’s promises will
19 be fulfilled, the outcomes articulated by the industry will be met or
20 exceeded, and the anticipated economic, fiscal and social benefits
21 driven by the industry will be fully realized.
22 3. The Legislature further finds and declares that the enactment
23 of this Act will achieve a bona fide public social and economic
24 purpose. The public investment made through the film infrastructure
25 transferable tax credits is intended to yield substantial benefits in
26 employment, workforce development and economic growth, and the
27 overall economic benefits expected to accrue from incremental
28 investment and the ongoing operations of the project will exceed
29 any adverse effect on public revenues from those tax incentives.
30 This Act, therefore, serves the public interest by fostering significant
31 new private investment, creating enduring jobs and educational
32 opportunities, and positioning Nevada as a leader in the content
33 creation industry while ensuring that the long-term gains to the
34 economy more than outweigh the State’s investment in the project.
35 Sec. 3. It is the intent of the Legislature, in enacting this Act,
36 to:
37 1. Promote the diversification of the economy of this State by
38 cultivating a thriving hub for content creation and production in
39 Nevada, which will establish Nevada as a nationally recognized
40 center for film, television and digital media production, thereby
41 broadening Nevada’s economic base beyond its traditional
42 industries and enhancing the State’s prominence in the creative
43 economy.
44 2. Provide an anchor for a new creative sector in Southern
45 Nevada through partnerships with global film and media companies
-

1 to develop and operate facilities for the production of film,
2 television and digital media productions and the involvement of
3 studio partners as anchor tenants to bring world-class expertise,
4 innovative technologies and global market access that will
5 accelerate the growth of a robust content creation industry in
6 Southern Nevada.
7 3. Support and promote workforce development in this State by
8 establishing and supporting education and vocational training
9 programs to prepare Nevada’s workforce for high-wage careers in
10 film, television and digital media production, equip Nevada’s
11 residents with in-demand skills and create pathways into the
12 industry, thereby generating thousands of new jobs for Nevadans
13 and building a skilled talent pool that sustains the State’s creative
14 sector for the long term.
15 Sec. 4. As used in sections 1 to 20, inclusive, of this act,
16 unless the context otherwise requires, the words and terms defined
17 in NRS 360.7582 and 360.7586, as amended by sections 24 and 25
18 of this act, have the meanings ascribed to them in those sections,

20 act have the meanings ascribed to them in those sections.

37 Improvement Act; and
38 2. At which vocational training and education is to be provided
39 for the development of a trained workforce for the production in this
40 State of qualified productions that are film and television
41 productions.
