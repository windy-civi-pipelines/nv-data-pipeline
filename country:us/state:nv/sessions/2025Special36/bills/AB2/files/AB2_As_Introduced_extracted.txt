(BDR 32-24)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to alcoholic beverages; revising the manner in
which a payment from a retail liquor store to a wholesale
dealer for delivery of certain alcoholic beverages must be
made by certain persons; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits a wholesale dealer from selling liquor to a retail liquor
2 store under certain circumstances relating to the method and timing of payments for
3 the delivery of that liquor. Existing law: (1) with certain exceptions, requires
4 payment from a retail liquor store to a wholesale dealer for the delivery of beer,
5 wine or distilled spirits to be made by electronic funds transfer; (2) requires the
6 wholesale dealer to initiate the electronic funds transfer by initiating the withdrawal
7 of funds from the bank account of the retail liquor store; (3) requires the electronic
8 funds transfer to be completed not later than the expiration of the 30th day after the
9 date of delivery of the beer, wine or distilled spirits; and (4) prohibits a wholesale
10 dealer from paying or being required to pay, directly or indirectly, any fees incurred
11 by the retail liquor store for such an electronic funds transfer. Existing law also
12 authorizes a retail liquor store to elect to pay for the delivery of beer, wine or
13 distilled spirits by credit card. If a retail liquor store so elects, existing law requires
14 the retail liquor store to: (1) notify the wholesaler of the election; and (2) be
15 responsible for all costs associated with processing the credit card transaction.
16 (NRS 369.485)
17 For the purposes of the regulation of gaming in this State, existing law defines
18 certain types of nonrestricted licenses and restricted licenses relating to the conduct
19 of gaming. A person who holds a nonrestricted license is licensed to operate: (1) 16
20 or more slot machines; (2) any number of slot machines together with any other
21 game, gaming device, race book or sports pool at one establishment; or (3) a slot
22 machine route. (NRS 463.0177) A person who holds a restricted license is licensed
23 to operate not more than 15 slot machines and no other game or gaming device,
-

– 2 –
24 race book or sports pool at an establishment in which the operation of slot machines
25 is incidental to the primary business of the establishment. (NRS 463.0189)
26 This bill exempts from the requirements of existing law relating to electronic
27 funds transfers and credit card transactions between a wholesale dealer and a retail
28 liquor store: (1) a person who holds a nonrestricted license and certain affiliates of
29 such a person; and (2) a person who holds a restricted license, if the person also
30 holds a nonrestricted license or is an affiliate of a person who holds a nonrestricted
31 license.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
