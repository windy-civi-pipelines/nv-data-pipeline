Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for various programs for the improvement of public
2 health and health care in this State. (NRS 433.702-433.744, 439.4921-439.5297,
3 439.600-439.690, 439A.111-439A.185, 439A.200-439A.290, 442.710-442.745,
4 457.230-457.280, 458.025, 458A.090, 458A.100, 458A.110) Section 10 of this bill
5 establishes the Statewide Health Care Access and Recruitment Grant Program,
6 which is a competitive grant program managed by the Nevada Health Authority to
7 support projects to address critical shortages of providers of health care or clinical
8 services or expertise in this State. Sections 3-7 of this bill define certain terms, and
9 section 2 of this bill establishes the applicability of those definitions. Section 8 of
10 this bill creates the Statewide Health Care Access and Recruitment Program
11 Account to hold money to fund the Program. Section 8 authorizes the Director of
12 the Authority, with the approval of the Interim Finance Committee, to transfer
13 money from the Account to another account for the purpose of obtaining additional
14 federal financial participation under Medicaid. Section 25 of this bill authorizes the
15 Interim Finance Committee to issue such approval during a legislative session.
16 Section 9 of this bill requires the Authority to conduct a biennial assessment of
17 the health care needs of this State, which must identify: (1) the total number of
18 providers of health care in this State who practice different professions and
19 specialties and; (2) the types of clinical services and expertise and the geographic
20 areas experiencing critical shortages of providers of health care and clinical
21 services or expertise. Section 27 of this bill provides that such an assessment is not
22 a regulation and is therefore not subject to notice and comment rulemaking. Section
23 38 of this bill requires the Authority to utilize existing assessments in lieu of
24 conducting the first scheduled assessment on or before July 1, 2026.
25 Section 10 authorizes certain entities involved in the provision of health care,
26 governmental entities and certain nonprofit organizations to apply for a grant of
27 money from the Account to support a project to address such critical shortages.
28 Section 10 imposes certain additional requirements for a project to be eligible to
29 receive such funding, including a requirement that certain applicants secure
30 matching financial or in-kind contributions valued at an amount at least equal to the
31 amount of the grant being sought. Section 11 of this bill prescribes the required
32 contents of an application for such a grant. Sections 12 and 13 of this bill prescribe
33 the process for the Authority to review applications and, with the approval of the
34 Interim Finance Committee, award grants. Section 25 authorizes the Interim
35 Finance Committee to issue such approval during a legislative session.
36 After a grant is awarded, section 14 of this bill requires the Authority to enter
37 into a funding agreement with the grantee that outlines the terms and conditions of
38 the grant and the responsibilities of the grantee. Section 15 of this bill requires a
39 grantee to notify and submit a revised plan to the Authority if: (1) the grantee
40 significantly modifies a funded project; (2) the amount of money available for a
41 funded project changes; (3) a funded project becomes inactive for at least 12
42 months; or (4) a funded project is terminated. Section 15 authorizes the Authority
43 to take certain actions in response to such notice. Section 16 of this bill authorizes
44 the Authority and the Office of Finance to provide certain oversight of a funded
45 project. Section 17 of this bill authorizes the Authority to suspend or terminate a
46 grant or take certain other actions if it determines that the grantee fails to comply
47 with a funding agreement. Section 17 also requires the Authority to suspend or
48 terminate a grant if it determines that the grantee has violated applicable law,

49 misused funds or submitted fraudulent information to the Authority. Upon the
50 completion of a funded project and again 10 years after the completion of a funded
51 project, section 18 of this bill requires the grantee to submit a report to the
52 Authority concerning the project. Section 26 of this bill includes administering the
53 Program within the general duties of the Authority.
54 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of: (1) physicians,
55 physician assistants, anesthesiologist assistants, genetic counselors, perfusionists
56 and practitioners of respiratory care by the Board of Medical Examiners; and (2)
57 osteopathic physicians, physician assistants and anesthesiologist assistants by the
58 State Board of Osteopathic Medicine. (Chapters 630 and 633 of NRS) Sections 29
59 and 33 of this bill require the Board of Medical Examiners and the State Board of
60 Osteopathic Medicine, respectively, to establish by regulation a procedure for
61 prioritizing applications for licensure as a physician or osteopathic physician of
62 applicants who plan to: (1) serve underserved geographic areas or populations in
63 this State as identified by the assessment conducted pursuant to section 9; or (2)
64 practice a specialty for which there is a shortage in this State as identified by the
65 assessment conducted pursuant to section 9. Sections 30 and 34 of this bill require
66 those Boards to establish electronic systems to expedite the verification of
67 credentials of providers of health care for the purposes of inclusion in insurance
68 networks and serving on the staff of hospitals. Sections 31 and 35 of this bill
69 require certain reports submitted by those Boards to the Governor and Legislature
70 to include information relating to the efficiency of the process for licensing
71 physicians or osteopathic physicians, as applicable. Section 37 of this bill
72 appropriates money to those Boards to carry out the provisions of sections 29-31
73 and 33-35.
74 Section 19 of this bill requires a hospital to process at least 95 percent of
75 complete requests from providers of health care for privileges to perform services
76 at the hospital not later than 60 days after receiving all of the information necessary
77 to complete such a request. Sections 20-24 of this bill make conforming changes to
78 indicate the applicability of, and provide for the administration of, the requirements
79 of section 19 in the same manner as other requirements governing hospitals, except
80 that sections 19 and 22-24 provide that a hospital is not subject to penalties for
81 failure to comply with section 19.
82 Existing law authorizes a registered pharmacist to possess and administer a
83 dangerous drug in accordance with the applicable regulations of the State Board of
84 Pharmacy if the pharmacist: (1) is trained in and certified to carry out standards and
85 practices for immunization programs; (2) is authorized to administer immunizations
86 pursuant to a written protocol from a physician; and (3) administers immunizations
87 in compliance with certain standards recommended and approved by the Advisory
88 Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and
89 Prevention. (NRS 454.213) Section 24.5 of this bill revises the third requirement by
90 instead providing that the registered pharmacist must administer immunizations in
91 compliance with certain federal standards and recommendations in effect on
92 January 1, 2025, and any modifications to those standards and recommendations or
93 additional standards and recommendations as the State Board of Health may
94 prescribe by regulation.
