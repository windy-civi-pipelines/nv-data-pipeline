Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for various programs for the improvement of public health and
2 health care in this State. (NRS 433.702-433.744, 439.4921-439.5297, 439.600-439.690,
3 439A.111-439A.185, 439A.200-439A.290, 442.710-442.745, 457.230-457.280, 458.025,
4 458A.090, 458A.100, 458A.110) Section 10 of this bill establishes the Statewide Health Care

Assembly Amendment No. 8 to Senate Bill No. 5 First Reprint Page 4
5 Access and Recruitment Grant Program, which is a competitive grant program managed by
6 the Nevada Health Authority to support projects to address critical shortages of providers of
7 health care or clinical services or expertise in this State. Sections 3-7 of this bill define certain
8 terms, and section 2 of this bill establishes the applicability of those definitions. Section 8 of
9 this bill creates the Statewide Health Care Access and Recruitment Program Account to hold
10 money to fund the Program. Section 8 authorizes the Director of the Authority, with the
11 approval of the Interim Finance Committee, to transfer money from the Account to another
12 account for the purpose of obtaining additional federal financial participation under Medicaid.
13 Section 25 of this bill authorizes the Interim Finance Committee to issue such approval during
14 a legislative session.
15 Section 9 of this bill requires the Authority to conduct a biennial assessment of the health
16 care needs of this State, which must identify: (1) the total number of providers of health care
17 in this State who practice different professions and specialties and; (2) the types of clinical
18 services and expertise and the geographic areas experiencing critical shortages of providers of
19 health care and clinical services or expertise. Section 27 of this bill provides that such an
20 assessment is not a regulation and is therefore not subject to notice and comment rulemaking.
21 Section 38 of this bill requires the Authority to utilize existing assessments in lieu of
22 conducting the first scheduled assessment on or before July 1, 2026.
23 Section 10 authorizes certain entities involved in the provision of health care,
24 governmental entities and certain nonprofit organizations to apply for a grant of money from
25 the Account to support a project to address such critical shortages. Section 10 imposes certain
26 additional requirements for a project to be eligible to receive such funding, including a
27 requirement that certain applicants secure matching financial or in-kind contributions valued
28 at an amount at least equal to the amount of the grant being sought. Section 11 of this bill
29 prescribes the required contents of an application for such a grant. Sections 12 and 13 of this
30 bill prescribe the process for the Authority to review applications and, with the approval of the
31 Interim Finance Committee, award grants. Section 25 authorizes the Interim Finance
32 Committee to issue such approval during a legislative session.
33 After a grant is awarded, section 14 of this bill requires the Authority to enter into a
34 funding agreement with the grantee that outlines the terms and conditions of the grant and the
35 responsibilities of the grantee. Section 15 of this bill requires a grantee to notify and submit a
36 revised plan to the Authority if: (1) the grantee significantly modifies a funded project; (2) the
37 amount of money available for a funded project changes; (3) a funded project becomes
38 inactive for at least 12 months; or (4) a funded project is terminated. Section 15 authorizes the
39 Authority to take certain actions in response to such notice. Section 16 of this bill authorizes
40 the Authority and the Office of Finance to provide certain oversight of a funded project.
41 Section 17 of this bill authorizes the Authority to suspend or terminate a grant or take certain
42 other actions if it determines that the grantee fails to comply with a funding agreement.
43 Section 17 also requires the Authority to suspend or terminate a grant if it determines that the
44 grantee has violated applicable law, misused funds or submitted fraudulent information to the
45 Authority. Upon the completion of a funded project and again 10 years after the completion of
46 a funded project, section 18 of this bill requires the grantee to submit a report to the Authority
47 concerning the project. Section 26 of this bill includes administering the Program within the
48 general duties of the Authority.
49 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of: (1) physicians, physician
50 assistants, anesthesiologist assistants, genetic counselors, perfusionists and practitioners of
51 respiratory care by the Board of Medical Examiners; and (2) osteopathic physicians, physician
52 assistants and anesthesiologist assistants by the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine.
53 (Chapters 630 and 633 of NRS) Sections 29 and 33 of this bill require the Board of Medical
54 Examiners and the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine, respectively, to establish by
55 regulation a procedure for prioritizing applications for licensure as a physician or osteopathic
56 physician of applicants who plan to: (1) serve underserved geographic areas or populations in
57 this State as identified by the assessment conducted pursuant to section 9; or (2) practice a
58 specialty for which there is a shortage in this State as identified by the assessment conducted
59 pursuant to section 9. Sections 30 and 34 of this bill require those Boards to establish
60 electronic systems to expedite the verification of credentials of providers of health care for the
61 purposes of inclusion in insurance networks and serving on the staff of hospitals. Sections 31
62 and 35 of this bill require certain reports submitted by those Boards to the Governor and
63 Legislature to include information relating to the efficiency of the process for licensing

Assembly Amendment No. 8 to Senate Bill No. 5 First Reprint Page 5
64 physicians or osteopathic physicians, as applicable. Section 37 of this bill appropriates money
65 to those Boards to carry out the provisions of sections 29-31 and 33-35.
66 Section 19 of this bill requires a hospital to process at least 95 percent of complete
67 requests from providers of health care for privileges to perform services at the hospital not
68 later than 60 days after receiving all of the information necessary to complete such a request.
69 Sections 20-24 of this bill make conforming changes to indicate the applicability of, and
70 provide for the [enforcement] administration of, the [provisions] requirements of section 19
71 [.] in the same manner as other requirements governing hospitals, except that sections 19
72 and 22-24 provide that a hospital is not subject to penalties for failure to comply with
73 section 19.
74 Existing law authorizes a registered pharmacist to possess and administer a dangerous
75 drug in accordance with the applicable regulations of the State Board of Pharmacy if the
76 pharmacist: (1) is trained in and certified to carry out standards and practices for
77 immunization programs; (2) is authorized to administer immunizations pursuant to a written
78 protocol from a physician; and (3) administers immunizations in compliance with certain
79 standards recommended and approved by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices
80 of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (NRS 454.213) Section 24.5 of this bill
81 revises the third requirement by instead providing that the registered pharmacist must
82 administer immunizations in compliance with certain federal standards and recommendations
83 in effect on January 1, 2025, and any modifications to those standards and recommendations
84 or additional standards and recommendations as the State Board of Health may prescribe by
85 regulation.
