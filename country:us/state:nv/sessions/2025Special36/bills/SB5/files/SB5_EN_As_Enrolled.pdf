Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law provides for various programs for the improvement of public
health and health care in this State. (NRS 433.702-433.744, 439.4921-439.5297,
439.600-439.690, 439A.111-439A.185, 439A.200-439A.290, 442.710-442.745,
457.230-457.280, 458.025, 458A.090, 458A.100, 458A.110) Section 10 of this bill
establishes the Statewide Health Care Access and Recruitment Grant Program,
which is a competitive grant program managed by the Nevada Health Authority to
support projects to address critical shortages of providers of health care or clinical
services or expertise in this State. Sections 3-7 of this bill define certain terms, and
section 2 of this bill establishes the applicability of those definitions. Section 8 of
this bill creates the Statewide Health Care Access and Recruitment Program
Account to hold money to fund the Program. Section 8 authorizes the Director of
the Authority, with the approval of the Interim Finance Committee, to transfer
money from the Account to another account for the purpose of obtaining additional
federal financial participation under Medicaid. Section 25 of this bill authorizes the
Interim Finance Committee to issue such approval during a legislative session.
Section 9 of this bill requires the Authority to conduct a biennial assessment of
the health care needs of this State, which must identify: (1) the total number of
-

– 2 –
providers of health care in this State who practice different professions and
specialties and; (2) the types of clinical services and expertise and the geographic
areas experiencing critical shortages of providers of health care and clinical
services or expertise. Section 27 of this bill provides that such an assessment is not
a regulation and is therefore not subject to notice and comment rulemaking. Section
38 of this bill requires the Authority to utilize existing assessments in lieu of
conducting the first scheduled assessment on or before July 1, 2026.
Section 10 authorizes certain entities involved in the provision of health care,
governmental entities and certain nonprofit organizations to apply for a grant of
money from the Account to support a project to address such critical shortages.
Section 10 imposes certain additional requirements for a project to be eligible to
receive such funding, including a requirement that certain applicants secure
matching financial or in-kind contributions valued at an amount at least equal to the
amount of the grant being sought. Section 11 of this bill prescribes the required
contents of an application for such a grant. Sections 12 and 13 of this bill prescribe
the process for the Authority to review applications and, with the approval of the
Interim Finance Committee, award grants. Section 25 authorizes the Interim
Finance Committee to issue such approval during a legislative session.
After a grant is awarded, section 14 of this bill requires the Authority to enter
into a funding agreement with the grantee that outlines the terms and conditions of
the grant and the responsibilities of the grantee. Section 15 of this bill requires a
grantee to notify and submit a revised plan to the Authority if: (1) the grantee
significantly modifies a funded project; (2) the amount of money available for a
funded project changes; (3) a funded project becomes inactive for at least 12
months; or (4) a funded project is terminated. Section 15 authorizes the Authority
to take certain actions in response to such notice. Section 16 of this bill authorizes
the Authority and the Office of Finance to provide certain oversight of a funded
project. Section 17 of this bill authorizes the Authority to suspend or terminate a
grant or take certain other actions if it determines that the grantee fails to comply
with a funding agreement. Section 17 also requires the Authority to suspend or
terminate a grant if it determines that the grantee has violated applicable law,
misused funds or submitted fraudulent information to the Authority. Upon the
completion of a funded project and again 10 years after the completion of a funded
project, section 18 of this bill requires the grantee to submit a report to the
Authority concerning the project. Section 26 of this bill includes administering the
Program within the general duties of the Authority.
Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of: (1) physicians,
physician assistants, anesthesiologist assistants, genetic counselors, perfusionists
and practitioners of respiratory care by the Board of Medical Examiners; and (2)
osteopathic physicians, physician assistants and anesthesiologist assistants by the
State Board of Osteopathic Medicine. (Chapters 630 and 633 of NRS) Sections 29
and 33 of this bill require the Board of Medical Examiners and the State Board of
Osteopathic Medicine, respectively, to establish by regulation a procedure for
prioritizing applications for licensure as a physician or osteopathic physician of
applicants who plan to: (1) serve underserved geographic areas or populations in
this State as identified by the assessment conducted pursuant to section 9; or (2)
practice a specialty for which there is a shortage in this State as identified by the
assessment conducted pursuant to section 9. Sections 30 and 34 of this bill require
those Boards to establish electronic systems to expedite the verification of
credentials of providers of health care for the purposes of inclusion in insurance
networks and serving on the staff of hospitals. Sections 31 and 35 of this bill
require certain reports submitted by those Boards to the Governor and Legislature
to include information relating to the efficiency of the process for licensing
-

– 3 –
physicians or osteopathic physicians, as applicable. Section 37 of this bill
appropriates money to those Boards to carry out the provisions of sections 29-31
and 33-35.
Section 19 of this bill requires a hospital to process at least 95 percent of
complete requests from providers of health care for privileges to perform services
at the hospital not later than 60 days after receiving all of the information necessary
to complete such a request. Sections 20-24 of this bill make conforming changes to
indicate the applicability of, and provide for the administration of, the requirements
of section 19 in the same manner as other requirements governing hospitals, except
that sections 19 and 22-24 provide that a hospital is not subject to penalties for
failure to comply with section 19.
Existing law authorizes a registered pharmacist to possess and administer a
dangerous drug in accordance with the applicable regulations of the State Board of
Pharmacy if the pharmacist: (1) is trained in and certified to carry out standards and
practices for immunization programs; (2) is authorized to administer immunizations
pursuant to a written protocol from a physician; and (3) administers immunizations
in compliance with certain standards recommended and approved by the Advisory
Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. (NRS 454.213) Section 24.5 of this bill revises the third requirement by
instead providing that the registered pharmacist must administer immunizations in
compliance with certain federal standards and recommendations in effect on
January 1, 2025, and any modifications to those standards and recommendations or
additional standards and recommendations as the State Board of Health may
prescribe by regulation.
