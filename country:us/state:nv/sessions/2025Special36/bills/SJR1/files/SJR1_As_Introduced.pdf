SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION—Proposing to amend the Nevada
Constitution to enact various requirements relating to the
distribution and submission of mail ballots.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 The Nevada Constitution requires all elections by the people to be by ballot.
2 (Nev. Const. Art. 2, § 5) The Nevada Constitution further entitles each voter who is
3 a qualified elector and registered to vote to receive and cast a ballot that: (1) is
4 written in a format that allows the clear identification of candidates; and (2)
5 accurately records the voter’s preference in the selection of candidates. (Nev.
6 Const. Art. 2, § 1A)
7 This joint resolution proposes to amend the Nevada Constitution to: (1) require
8 a county clerk to send to each active registered voter in the county who is eligible
9 to vote in an election a mail ballot; (2) prescribe, with certain exceptions, the time
10 period during which the clerk must send the mail ballot; and (3) require the county
11 clerk to send the mail ballot and certain additional material by certain means. This
12 joint resolution further amends the Nevada Constitution to authorize a person to
13 elect to not receive a mail ballot by submitting certain notice to the county clerk.
14 Existing law requires county clerks, for a primary election or general election,
15 to establish a certain number of polling places for early voting by personal
16 appearance and for voting in person on the day of the election. (NRS 293.2731,
17 293.3575) This joint resolution proposes to amend the Nevada Constitution to
18 require any polling place that is used for early voting by personal appearance or for
19 voting in person on the day of the election to accept the submission of mail ballots
20 by voters while voting in person occurs. This joint resolution additionally proposes
21 to amend the Nevada Constitution to require, during the 3 days immediately
22 preceding any primary election or general election, each county clerk to establish a
23 certain number of sites at which voters may return mail ballots. These sites must be
24 available for at least 8 hours on each day and located at a polling place that is used
25 for early voting by personal appearance or voting in person on the day of the
26 election. Finally, this joint resolution amends the Nevada Constitution to authorize:
