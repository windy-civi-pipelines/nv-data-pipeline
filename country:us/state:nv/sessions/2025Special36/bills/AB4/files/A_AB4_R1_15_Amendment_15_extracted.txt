properly relating thereto.
If this amendment is adopted, the Legislative Counsel᾿s Digest will be changed
as follows:
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides that if a person commits an assault upon an officer who is
2 performing his or her duty and the person knew or should have known that the victim was an
3 officer, the person is guilty of: (1) a category B felony if the assault is made with the use of a
4 deadly weapon or the present ability to use a deadly weapon; (2) a category D felony if the
5 person is a probationer, prisoner or parolee; or (3) if neither of those circumstances is present,
6 a gross misdemeanor. (NRS 200.471) Additionally, existing law provides that if a person
7 commits a battery upon an officer and the person knew or should have known that the victim
8 was an officer, the person is guilty of: (1) a category B felony if the battery causes substantial
9 bodily harm or is committed by strangulation; or (2) if those circumstances are not present and
10 no greater penalty is provided by law, a gross misdemeanor. (NRS 200.481) Sections 1 and 2
11 of this bill revise the definition of “officer” for the purposes of the enhanced penalties for
12 assault or battery to include an employee of this State or a political subdivision of this State
13 whose normal job responsibilities require the employee to: (1) interact with the public; and (2)
14 perform tasks related to child welfare services or child protective services or tasks that expose
15 the person to comparable danger. Additionally, sections 1 and 2 apply the enhanced penalties
16 to an assault or battery committed against a hospitality employee.
17 Existing law prohibits a person from stalking and prescribes various penalties related to
18 the circumstance under which the offense is committed. (NRS 200.575) Section 3 of this bill
19 expands the unlawful acts which constitute stalking to include certain courses of conduct that
20 would cause the victim to feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated, harassed or fearful for the
21 immediate safety of a person in a dating relationship with the victim. Section 3 also makes
22 various changes to provide that stalking encompasses both acts committed in person and by
Assembly Amendment No. 15 to Assembly Bill No. 4 First Reprint Page 4
23 electronic means, and provides that such penalties are generally applicable to such acts
24 regardless of medium. Sections 25 and 45 of this bill make conforming changes related to the
25 commission of stalking by electronic means under section 3.
26 Existing law provides that it is unlawful for a person to knowingly and willfully have in
27 his or her possession: (1) any film, photograph or other visual representation depicting a
28 person under the age of 16 years as the subject of a sexual portrayal or engaging in or
29 simulating, or assisting others to engage in or simulate, sexual conduct; or (2) computer-
30 generated child sexual abuse material. (NRS 200.730) Section 4 of this bill revises the unit of
31 prosecution for such an offense and prescribes that each person depicted under the age of 16
32 years in any film, photograph or other visual presentation and each child depicted or
33 represented in any computer-generated child sexual abuse material, respectively, constitutes a
34 separate offense.
35 Existing law establishes certain crimes making it unlawful to take or obtain property.
36 (NRS 205.0821-205.295) Section 7 of this bill creates a new crime which provides that if a
37 person intentionally causes property damage to a retail establishment in the commission of a
38 theft offense and the aggregate value of the amount involved in the theft or property damage,
39 or any combination thereof, is $750 or more, the person is guilty of a category C felony.
40 [Existing law: (1) prescribes various circumstances in which a person is prohibited from
41 owning, possessing or having under his or her custody or control a firearm; and (2) establishes
42 procedures related to the surrender, sale or transfer of a firearm by certain persons who are
43 prohibited from owning, possessing or having under their custody or control a firearm. (NRS
44 33.031, 33.033) Sections 11 and 26 of this bill generally require a court to schedule a
45 compliance hearing under such circumstances to determine whether a person has complied
46 with a court order to surrender, sell or transfer a firearm. Sections 11 and 26, however,
47 authorize the court to cancel the compliance hearing under certain circumstances. Sections 12
48 and 27 of this bill apply certain related definitions in existing law to sections 11 and 26,
49 respectively.]
50 Existing law sets forth certain unlawful acts that constitute domestic violence when
51 committed against certain persons. (NRS 33.018) Section 13 of this bill revises the unlawful
52 acts that constitute domestic violence to include kidnapping as well as an attempt or
53 solicitation to commit any unlawful act that constitutes domestic violence.
54 Existing law establishes provisions concerning actions for wrongful conviction. (NRS
55 41.900-41.970) Section 14 of this bill provides that the entry of a certificate of innocence and
56 the award in an action for wrongful conviction is not a finding that: (1) certain persons
57 committed a wrongdoing; or (2) there was not probable cause under certain circumstances.
58 Existing law provides that if a child who is alleged to be delinquent is taken into custody
59 and detained, the child must be given a detention hearing before the juvenile court. (NRS
60 62C.040) Section 15 of this bill requires the juvenile court to order a qualified professional to
61 evaluate the mental health of a child who: (1) is alleged to have committed certain unlawful
62 acts involving a battery against a school employee or a child welfare professional; and (2) has,
63 in the previous year, been taken into custody two or more times for certain battery offenses.
64 Section 16 of this bill makes a conforming change related to the detention of such children
65 under section 15.
66 Existing law requires a juvenile court to suspend the driver’s license of a juvenile under
67 certain circumstances if a child is adjudicated to be in need of supervision because the child:
68 (1) is a habitual truant; (2) committed certain unlawful acts related to tobacco; (3) committed
69 certain unlawful acts related to a controlled substance or alcohol; or (4) placed graffiti on or
70 defaced property. (NRS 62E.430, 62E.440, 62E.630, 62E.690) Sections 17-20 of this bill
71 make various changes to authorize the juvenile court to order the Department of Motor
72 Vehicles to issue a restricted driver’s license to the child if the issuance is in the best interest
73 of the child. Section 51 of this bill makes a conforming change regarding the circumstances
74 under which the Department of Motor Vehicles may issue a restricted driver’s license.
Assembly Amendment No. 15 to Assembly Bill No. 4 First Reprint Page 5
75 Existing law requires a court to discharge a defendant and dismiss the proceedings or set
76 aside the judgment of conviction upon completion of the terms and conditions related to a
77 program of treatment for alcohol or other substance use disorder, a program for treatment of
78 mental illness or a program of treatment for veterans and members of the military or certain
79 other terms and conditions. Thereafter, existing law requires the sealing of records related to
80 the discharge, dismissal or setting aside a judgment of conviction. (NRS 176.211, 176A.240,
81 176A.245, 176A.260, 176A.265, 176A.290, 176A.295) Sections 21-24 of this bill provide
82 that the automatic record sealing provisions do not apply to such persons who were charged
83 with certain offenses related to the abuse or neglect of a child or the abuse of an older or
84 vulnerable person.
85 Existing law requires a court to release any bail at the time of sentencing, if the court has
86 not already done so, unless the defendant owes fines and costs, in which case, the bail must be
87 applied towards the fines and costs. (NRS 178.522, 178.528) Section 29 of this bill provides
88 that under these circumstances if the bail has been deposited by a person other than a surety,
89 and upon notice and the agreement of the person, the bail must first be applied towards the
90 payment of any restitution owed by the defendant. Section 28 of this bill makes a conforming
91 change related to the procedures prescribed by section 29.
92 Existing law authorizes: (1) a district attorney and any attorney employed by a district
93 attorney to prosecute a person in a county other than the county by which the district attorney
94 is employed for the limited purpose of conducting a pretrial release hearing; and (2) such an
95 attorney to receive a stipend for being available on a weekend or holiday to serve as a
96 prosecuting attorney in a pretrial release hearing. (NRS 178.760) Section 30 of this bill
97 similarly authorizes a city attorney in a county whose population is less than 100,000
98 (currently all counties except Clark and Washoe Counties) to be deputized to prosecute a
99 person in the county that encompasses the city that employs the city attorney for the limited
100 purpose of serving as a prosecuting attorney in a pretrial release hearing, and authorizes the
101 city attorney to receive the stipend for such services.
102 Existing law authorizes the establishment of correctional programs and judicial programs
103 for the reentry of offenders and parolees into the community. (NRS 209.4871-209.4889)
104 Section 33 of this bill: (1) authorizes the Director of the Department of Corrections to
105 establish an alternative correctional program; and (2) provides for the qualification and
106 assignment offenders to the alternative correctional program. Section 33.5 of this bill requires
107 the Director to submit an annual report to the Interim Finance Committee relating to the
108 alternative correctional program. Section 42 of this bill authorizes an offender participating in
109 an alternative correctional program to waive his or her eligibility for, and release on, parole.
110 Section 43 of this bill establishes provisions related to the effect of such a waiver. Section 44
111 of this bill requires the State Board of Parole Commissioners to consider the removal of an
112 offender from an alternative correctional program in its determination of whether to release an
113 offender on parole. Sections 32, 35, 36 and 39-41 of this bill establish and revise various
114 provisions concerning the alternative correctional program.
115 Existing law authorizes the Director of the Department of Corrections and the sheriff,
116 chief of police or town marshal to establish programs for the treatment of prisoners with a
117 substance use disorder using medication-assisted treatment. (NRS 209.4247, 211.400)
118 Sections 34 and 37 of this bill require persons who establish such programs to collaborate
119 with the Department of Human Services if the program relates to opioid use disorder.
120 [Existing law provides that before a prisoner who is in the custody of a county or city jail
121 or detention facility is questioned about his or her immigration status, the prisoner must be
122 informed about the purpose of such questions. (NRS 211.007) Section 36.5 of this bill
123 establishes procedures relating to the automatic notification of consular posts if a county or
124 city jail or detention facility in a county whose population is 700,000 or more (currently only
125 Clark County) believes that a prisoner is not a United States citizen. Section 36.5 additionally
126 requires the Peace Officers’ Standards and Training Commission to develop certain training
127 materials relating to the automatic notification requirements, the rights of foreign nationals
Assembly Amendment No. 15 to Assembly Bill No. 4 First Reprint Page 6
128 under international law and procedures for identifying foreign nationals during the intake
129 process.]
130 Existing law: (1) authorizes a board of county commissioners, with certain exceptions, to
131 exercise all powers necessary or proper to address matters of local concern for the effective
132 operation of a county government, whether or not the powers are expressly granted to the
133 board; and (2) defines “matter of local concern” for such purposes. (NRS 244.143, 244.146)
134 Existing law also authorizes a board of county commissioners to enact and enforce local
135 police and sanitary ordinances and regulations that are not in conflict with the general laws
136 and regulations of this State. (NRS 244.357) Section 46 of this bill requires a board of county
137 commissioners in a county whose population is 700,000 or more (currently only Clark
138 County) to adopt an ordinance that designates the geographic boundaries of one or more
139 corridors in which the commission of crime poses a significant risk to public safety and the
140 economic welfare of this State due to the high concentration of tourists, visitors, employees
141 and other persons in such corridors. Section 46 provides that a person who is charged with,
142 convicted of or the subject of deferred adjudication for any offense punishable as a
143 misdemeanor: (1) for the first offense within the corridor within 2 years, may as a condition of
144 release, sentencing, suspension of sentence or deferred adjudication, as applicable, be
145 prohibited from entering the corridor in which the offense occurred for a period not to exceed
146 1 year; and (2) for a second or subsequent offense within the corridor within 2 years, must as a
147 condition of release, sentencing, suspension of sentence or deferred adjudication, as
148 applicable, be prohibited from entering the corridor in which the offense occurred for a period
149 of not less than 1 year.
150 Section 9 of this bill authorizes a justice court, in a county wherein the board of county
151 commissioners adopts an ordinance designating the geographic boundaries of one or more
152 corridors pursuant to section 46, to establish an appropriate program for the adjudication of
153 offenses punishable as a misdemeanor that occurred within the boundaries of such corridors.
154 Section 10 of this bill requires a justice court whose jurisdiction includes a corridor
155 established pursuant to section 46 to prepare and submit: (1) to the Legislature an annual
156 report containing certain information regarding crimes that occur within such corridors; and
157 (2) to the respective board of county commissioners a monthly report containing certain
158 information regarding crimes that occur within such corridors.
159 Existing law requires the Department of Human Services: (1) to conduct a statewide
160 needs assessment to determine the priorities for allocating money from the Fund for a
161 Resilient Nevada; and (2) based on that needs assessment, to develop a statewide plan for
162 allocating the money in the Fund. (NRS 433.732, 433.734) Existing law also prescribes
163 specific requirements concerning the statewide needs assessment. (NRS 433.736) Section 50
164 of this bill requires the statewide needs assessment to identify educational resources to be used
165 for the training of law enforcement and other criminal justice agencies related to trauma-
166 informed practices and medication-assisted treatment for persons with opioid use disorder.
167 Section 49 of this bill makes a conforming change to refer to provisions renumbered by
168 section 50.
169 Existing law establishes provisions related to peer recovery support services. (NRS
170 433.622-433.641) Section 47 of this bill requires the Department of Human Services to make
171 available certain information relating to peer recovery support services. Sections 48 and 56-
172 58 of this bill make conforming changes governing the applicability of section 47 to certain
173 existing provisions of law related to peer support services.
174 Existing law sets forth various penalties involving driving or operating a vehicle or vessel
175 under the influence of alcohol, a controlled substance or a prohibited substance under certain
176 circumstances. (Chapter 484C of NRS, NRS 488.400-488.520) Sections 52 and 54 of this bill
177 provide that the prohibition on a person driving or operating a vehicle or vessel with a specific
178 amount of marijuana or marijuana metabolite in his or her blood applies to certain offenses
179 punishable as a felony. Sections 53 and 55 of this bill increase the terms of imprisonment for
180 a person who proximately causes the death of another person while driving or operating a
Assembly Amendment No. 15 to Assembly Bill No. 4 First Reprint Page 7
181 vehicle or vessel under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance. Additionally,
182 sections 53 and 55 further provide that any such person who proximately causes the death of
183 another person and who has previously been once or twice convicted of certain offenses
184 relating to driving or operating a vehicle or vessel under the influence of alcohol or a
185 controlled substance is subject to an increased penalty.
186 During the 2021 Legislative Session, the Legislature made an appropriation to the
187 Department of Corrections for the reintegration of the Offender Sentence Management
188 System into the Nevada Offender Tracking Information System. Any remaining balance of
189 that appropriation was required to be reverted to the State General Fund on or before
190 September 15, 2023. (Section 2 of chapter 463, Statutes of Nevada 2021, at page 2875)
191 During the 2023 and 2025 Legislative Sessions, the Legislature extended the reversion date to
192 September 19, 2025, and September 17, 2027, respectively. Section 58.1 of this bill extends
193 the reversion date to September 21, 2029.
194 Existing law authorizes an offender to earn certain credits to reduce the sentence of
195 imprisonment of the offender. (NRS 209.432-209.449) During the 2023 Legislative Session,
196 the Legislature established a revised method for awarding credits to reduce the sentence of an
197 offender that applied to an offender sentenced to a crime committed: (1) on or after July 1,
198 2025; or (2) before July 1, 2025, if the offender elected to be subject to the revised method.
199 (NRS 209.4467) During the 2025 Legislative Session, the Legislature delayed the
200 implementation of the revised method to July 1, 2026. Sections 58.2-58.7 of this bill further
201 delay the implementation of the revised method to July 1, 2027. Additionally, section 58.2
202 requires the Director of the Department of Corrections to calculate the credit of certain
203 offenders who are within 2 years of completion of their minimum term or minimum aggregate
204 term or maximum term or maximum aggregate term, as applicable, of imprisonment on or
205 after July 1, 2027, using the revised method, and authorizes such offenders and the Director to
206 make certain decisions affecting parole eligibility and release.
207 Section 59 of this bill makes an appropriation to the Interim Finance Committee for
208 allocation to the Administrative Office of the Courts for the purpose of carrying out the
209 provisions of this bill. Sections 60 and 60.5 of this bill make appropriations to the
210 Department of Corrections relating to alternative correctional programs. Section 61 of this bill

Assembly Amendment No. 15 to Assembly Bill No. 4 First Reprint Page 3
The Title of Assembly Bill No. 4 First Reprint is hereby amended as follows:
AN ACT relating to public safety; revising provisions relating to assault, battery,
stalking, child sexual abuse material, domestic violence and driving
under the influence of alcohol or a prohibited substance; [requiring a
compliance hearing after the issuance of certain orders to relinquish
firearms;] establishing certain unlawful acts relating to certain theft
offenses involving property damage; revising provisions relating to
offenders; establishing provisions relating to the creation of corridors
and the adjudication and reporting of certain offenses committed
within such corridors; making various changes relating to juvenile
justice; prohibiting the construction of certain findings relating to
actions for wrongful conviction; revising provisions relating to the
sealing of records and specialty court programs; revising provisions
relating to pretrial release; authorizing the Director of the Department
of Corrections to establish an alternative correctional program;
[requiring certain city and county jails and detention centers to
automatically notify consular posts regarding the detention of certain
prisoners;] revising provisions relating to opioid use disorder; making
appropriations; providing penalties; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
If this amendment is adopted, the Legislative Counsel᾿s Digest will be changed
as follows:
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides that if a person commits an assault upon an officer who is
2 performing his or her duty and the person knew or should have known that the victim was an
3 officer, the person is guilty of: (1) a category B felony if the assault is made with the use of a
4 deadly weapon or the present ability to use a deadly weapon; (2) a category D felony if the
5 person is a probationer, prisoner or parolee; or (3) if neither of those circumstances is present,
6 a gross misdemeanor. (NRS 200.471) Additionally, existing law provides that if a person
7 commits a battery upon an officer and the person knew or should have known that the victim
8 was an officer, the person is guilty of: (1) a category B felony if the battery causes substantial
9 bodily harm or is committed by strangulation; or (2) if those circumstances are not present and
10 no greater penalty is provided by law, a gross misdemeanor. (NRS 200.481) Sections 1 and 2
11 of this bill revise the definition of “officer” for the purposes of the enhanced penalties for
12 assault or battery to include an employee of this State or a political subdivision of this State
13 whose normal job responsibilities require the employee to: (1) interact with the public; and (2)
14 perform tasks related to child welfare services or child protective services or tasks that expose
15 the person to comparable danger. Additionally, sections 1 and 2 apply the enhanced penalties
16 to an assault or battery committed against a hospitality employee.
17 Existing law prohibits a person from stalking and prescribes various penalties related to
18 the circumstance under which the offense is committed. (NRS 200.575) Section 3 of this bill
19 expands the unlawful acts which constitute stalking to include certain courses of conduct that
20 would cause the victim to feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated, harassed or fearful for the
21 immediate safety of a person in a dating relationship with the victim. Section 3 also makes
22 various changes to provide that stalking encompasses both acts committed in person and by

Assembly Amendment No. 15 to Assembly Bill No. 4 First Reprint Page 4
23 electronic means, and provides that such penalties are generally applicable to such acts
24 regardless of medium. Sections 25 and 45 of this bill make conforming changes related to the
25 commission of stalking by electronic means under section 3.
26 Existing law provides that it is unlawful for a person to knowingly and willfully have in
27 his or her possession: (1) any film, photograph or other visual representation depicting a
28 person under the age of 16 years as the subject of a sexual portrayal or engaging in or
29 simulating, or assisting others to engage in or simulate, sexual conduct; or (2) computer-
30 generated child sexual abuse material. (NRS 200.730) Section 4 of this bill revises the unit of
31 prosecution for such an offense and prescribes that each person depicted under the age of 16
32 years in any film, photograph or other visual presentation and each child depicted or
33 represented in any computer-generated child sexual abuse material, respectively, constitutes a
34 separate offense.
35 Existing law establishes certain crimes making it unlawful to take or obtain property.
36 (NRS 205.0821-205.295) Section 7 of this bill creates a new crime which provides that if a
37 person intentionally causes property damage to a retail establishment in the commission of a
38 theft offense and the aggregate value of the amount involved in the theft or property damage,
39 or any combination thereof, is $750 or more, the person is guilty of a category C felony.
40 [Existing law: (1) prescribes various circumstances in which a person is prohibited from
41 owning, possessing or having under his or her custody or control a firearm; and (2) establishes
42 procedures related to the surrender, sale or transfer of a firearm by certain persons who are
43 prohibited from owning, possessing or having under their custody or control a firearm. (NRS
44 33.031, 33.033) Sections 11 and 26 of this bill generally require a court to schedule a
45 compliance hearing under such circumstances to determine whether a person has complied
46 with a court order to surrender, sell or transfer a firearm. Sections 11 and 26, however,
47 authorize the court to cancel the compliance hearing under certain circumstances. Sections 12
48 and 27 of this bill apply certain related definitions in existing law to sections 11 and 26,
49 respectively.]
50 Existing law sets forth certain unlawful acts that constitute domestic violence when
51 committed against certain persons. (NRS 33.018) Section 13 of this bill revises the unlawful
52 acts that constitute domestic violence to include kidnapping as well as an attempt or
53 solicitation to commit any unlawful act that constitutes domestic violence.
54 Existing law establishes provisions concerning actions for wrongful conviction. (NRS
55 41.900-41.970) Section 14 of this bill provides that the entry of a certificate of innocence and
56 the award in an action for wrongful conviction is not a finding that: (1) certain persons
57 committed a wrongdoing; or (2) there was not probable cause under certain circumstances.
58 Existing law provides that if a child who is alleged to be delinquent is taken into custody
59 and detained, the child must be given a detention hearing before the juvenile court. (NRS
60 62C.040) Section 15 of this bill requires the juvenile court to order a qualified professional to
61 evaluate the mental health of a child who: (1) is alleged to have committed certain unlawful
62 acts involving a battery against a school employee or a child welfare professional; and (2) has,
63 in the previous year, been taken into custody two or more times for certain battery offenses.
64 Section 16 of this bill makes a conforming change related to the detention of such children
65 under section 15.
66 Existing law requires a juvenile court to suspend the driver’s license of a juvenile under
67 certain circumstances if a child is adjudicated to be in need of supervision because the child:
68 (1) is a habitual truant; (2) committed certain unlawful acts related to tobacco; (3) committed
69 certain unlawful acts related to a controlled substance or alcohol; or (4) placed graffiti on or
70 defaced property. (NRS 62E.430, 62E.440, 62E.630, 62E.690) Sections 17-20 of this bill
71 make various changes to authorize the juvenile court to order the Department of Motor
72 Vehicles to issue a restricted driver’s license to the child if the issuance is in the best interest
73 of the child. Section 51 of this bill makes a conforming change regarding the circumstances
74 under which the Department of Motor Vehicles may issue a restricted driver’s license.

Assembly Amendment No. 15 to Assembly Bill No. 4 First Reprint Page 5
75 Existing law requires a court to discharge a defendant and dismiss the proceedings or set
76 aside the judgment of conviction upon completion of the terms and conditions related to a
77 program of treatment for alcohol or other substance use disorder, a program for treatment of
78 mental illness or a program of treatment for veterans and members of the military or certain
79 other terms and conditions. Thereafter, existing law requires the sealing of records related to
80 the discharge, dismissal or setting aside a judgment of conviction. (NRS 176.211, 176A.240,
81 176A.245, 176A.260, 176A.265, 176A.290, 176A.295) Sections 21-24 of this bill provide
82 that the automatic record sealing provisions do not apply to such persons who were charged
83 with certain offenses related to the abuse or neglect of a child or the abuse of an older or
84 vulnerable person.
85 Existing law requires a court to release any bail at the time of sentencing, if the court has
86 not already done so, unless the defendant owes fines and costs, in which case, the bail must be
87 applied towards the fines and costs. (NRS 178.522, 178.528) Section 29 of this bill provides
88 that under these circumstances if the bail has been deposited by a person other than a surety,
89 and upon notice and the agreement of the person, the bail must first be applied towards the
90 payment of any restitution owed by the defendant. Section 28 of this bill makes a conforming
91 change related to the procedures prescribed by section 29.
92 Existing law authorizes: (1) a district attorney and any attorney employed by a district
93 attorney to prosecute a person in a county other than the county by which the district attorney
94 is employed for the limited purpose of conducting a pretrial release hearing; and (2) such an
95 attorney to receive a stipend for being available on a weekend or holiday to serve as a
96 prosecuting attorney in a pretrial release hearing. (NRS 178.760) Section 30 of this bill
97 similarly authorizes a city attorney in a county whose population is less than 100,000
98 (currently all counties except Clark and Washoe Counties) to be deputized to prosecute a
99 person in the county that encompasses the city that employs the city attorney for the limited
100 purpose of serving as a prosecuting attorney in a pretrial release hearing, and authorizes the
101 city attorney to receive the stipend for such services.
102 Existing law authorizes the establishment of correctional programs and judicial programs
103 for the reentry of offenders and parolees into the community. (NRS 209.4871-209.4889)
104 Section 33 of this bill: (1) authorizes the Director of the Department of Corrections to
105 establish an alternative correctional program; and (2) provides for the qualification and
106 assignment offenders to the alternative correctional program. Section 33.5 of this bill requires
107 the Director to submit an annual report to the Interim Finance Committee relating to the
108 alternative correctional program. Section 42 of this bill authorizes an offender participating in
109 an alternative correctional program to waive his or her eligibility for, and release on, parole.
110 Section 43 of this bill establishes provisions related to the effect of such a waiver. Section 44
111 of this bill requires the State Board of Parole Commissioners to consider the removal of an
112 offender from an alternative correctional program in its determination of whether to release an
113 offender on parole. Sections 32, 35, 36 and 39-41 of this bill establish and revise various
114 provisions concerning the alternative correctional program.
115 Existing law authorizes the Director of the Department of Corrections and the sheriff,
116 chief of police or town marshal to establish programs for the treatment of prisoners with a
117 substance use disorder using medication-assisted treatment. (NRS 209.4247, 211.400)
118 Sections 34 and 37 of this bill require persons who establish such programs to collaborate
119 with the Department of Human Services if the program relates to opioid use disorder.
120 [Existing law provides that before a prisoner who is in the custody of a county or city jail
121 or detention facility is questioned about his or her immigration status, the prisoner must be
122 informed about the purpose of such questions. (NRS 211.007) Section 36.5 of this bill
123 establishes procedures relating to the automatic notification of consular posts if a county or
124 city jail or detention facility in a county whose population is 700,000 or more (currently only
125 Clark County) believes that a prisoner is not a United States citizen. Section 36.5 additionally
126 requires the Peace Officers’ Standards and Training Commission to develop certain training
127 materials relating to the automatic notification requirements, the rights of foreign nationals

Assembly Amendment No. 15 to Assembly Bill No. 4 First Reprint Page 6
128 under international law and procedures for identifying foreign nationals during the intake
129 process.]
130 Existing law: (1) authorizes a board of county commissioners, with certain exceptions, to
131 exercise all powers necessary or proper to address matters of local concern for the effective
132 operation of a county government, whether or not the powers are expressly granted to the
133 board; and (2) defines “matter of local concern” for such purposes. (NRS 244.143, 244.146)
134 Existing law also authorizes a board of county commissioners to enact and enforce local
135 police and sanitary ordinances and regulations that are not in conflict with the general laws
136 and regulations of this State. (NRS 244.357) Section 46 of this bill requires a board of county
137 commissioners in a county whose population is 700,000 or more (currently only Clark
138 County) to adopt an ordinance that designates the geographic boundaries of one or more
139 corridors in which the commission of crime poses a significant risk to public safety and the
140 economic welfare of this State due to the high concentration of tourists, visitors, employees
141 and other persons in such corridors. Section 46 provides that a person who is charged with,
142 convicted of or the subject of deferred adjudication for any offense punishable as a
143 misdemeanor: (1) for the first offense within the corridor within 2 years, may as a condition of
144 release, sentencing, suspension of sentence or deferred adjudication, as applicable, be
145 prohibited from entering the corridor in which the offense occurred for a period not to exceed
146 1 year; and (2) for a second or subsequent offense within the corridor within 2 years, must as a
147 condition of release, sentencing, suspension of sentence or deferred adjudication, as
148 applicable, be prohibited from entering the corridor in which the offense occurred for a period
149 of not less than 1 year.
150 Section 9 of this bill authorizes a justice court, in a county wherein the board of county
151 commissioners adopts an ordinance designating the geographic boundaries of one or more
152 corridors pursuant to section 46, to establish an appropriate program for the adjudication of
153 offenses punishable as a misdemeanor that occurred within the boundaries of such corridors.
154 Section 10 of this bill requires a justice court whose jurisdiction includes a corridor
155 established pursuant to section 46 to prepare and submit: (1) to the Legislature an annual
156 report containing certain information regarding crimes that occur within such corridors; and
157 (2) to the respective board of county commissioners a monthly report containing certain
158 information regarding crimes that occur within such corridors.
159 Existing law requires the Department of Human Services: (1) to conduct a statewide
160 needs assessment to determine the priorities for allocating money from the Fund for a
161 Resilient Nevada; and (2) based on that needs assessment, to develop a statewide plan for
162 allocating the money in the Fund. (NRS 433.732, 433.734) Existing law also prescribes
163 specific requirements concerning the statewide needs assessment. (NRS 433.736) Section 50
164 of this bill requires the statewide needs assessment to identify educational resources to be used
165 for the training of law enforcement and other criminal justice agencies related to trauma-
166 informed practices and medication-assisted treatment for persons with opioid use disorder.
167 Section 49 of this bill makes a conforming change to refer to provisions renumbered by
168 section 50.
169 Existing law establishes provisions related to peer recovery support services. (NRS
170 433.622-433.641) Section 47 of this bill requires the Department of Human Services to make
171 available certain information relating to peer recovery support services. Sections 48 and 56-
172 58 of this bill make conforming changes governing the applicability of section 47 to certain
173 existing provisions of law related to peer support services.
174 Existing law sets forth various penalties involving driving or operating a vehicle or vessel
175 under the influence of alcohol, a controlled substance or a prohibited substance under certain
176 circumstances. (Chapter 484C of NRS, NRS 488.400-488.520) Sections 52 and 54 of this bill
177 provide that the prohibition on a person driving or operating a vehicle or vessel with a specific
178 amount of marijuana or marijuana metabolite in his or her blood applies to certain offenses
179 punishable as a felony. Sections 53 and 55 of this bill increase the terms of imprisonment for
180 a person who proximately causes the death of another person while driving or operating a

Assembly Amendment No. 15 to Assembly Bill No. 4 First Reprint Page 7
181 vehicle or vessel under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance. Additionally,
182 sections 53 and 55 further provide that any such person who proximately causes the death of
183 another person and who has previously been once or twice convicted of certain offenses
184 relating to driving or operating a vehicle or vessel under the influence of alcohol or a
185 controlled substance is subject to an increased penalty.
186 During the 2021 Legislative Session, the Legislature made an appropriation to the
187 Department of Corrections for the reintegration of the Offender Sentence Management
188 System into the Nevada Offender Tracking Information System. Any remaining balance of
189 that appropriation was required to be reverted to the State General Fund on or before
190 September 15, 2023. (Section 2 of chapter 463, Statutes of Nevada 2021, at page 2875)
191 During the 2023 and 2025 Legislative Sessions, the Legislature extended the reversion date to
192 September 19, 2025, and September 17, 2027, respectively. Section 58.1 of this bill extends
193 the reversion date to September 21, 2029.
194 Existing law authorizes an offender to earn certain credits to reduce the sentence of
195 imprisonment of the offender. (NRS 209.432-209.449) During the 2023 Legislative Session,
196 the Legislature established a revised method for awarding credits to reduce the sentence of an
197 offender that applied to an offender sentenced to a crime committed: (1) on or after July 1,
198 2025; or (2) before July 1, 2025, if the offender elected to be subject to the revised method.
199 (NRS 209.4467) During the 2025 Legislative Session, the Legislature delayed the
200 implementation of the revised method to July 1, 2026. Sections 58.2-58.7 of this bill further
201 delay the implementation of the revised method to July 1, 2027. Additionally, section 58.2
202 requires the Director of the Department of Corrections to calculate the credit of certain
203 offenders who are within 2 years of completion of their minimum term or minimum aggregate
204 term or maximum term or maximum aggregate term, as applicable, of imprisonment on or
205 after July 1, 2027, using the revised method, and authorizes such offenders and the Director to
206 make certain decisions affecting parole eligibility and release.
207 Section 59 of this bill makes an appropriation to the Interim Finance Committee for
208 allocation to the Administrative Office of the Courts for the purpose of carrying out the
209 provisions of this bill. Sections 60 and 60.5 of this bill make appropriations to the
210 Department of Corrections relating to alternative correctional programs. Section 61 of this bill
211 makes an appropriation to the Department of Corrections for the purpose of carrying out the
212 provisions of this bill.

27 (1) The date of the notification;
28 (2) The method used for the notification; and
29 (3) The consular post that was contacted for the notification; and
30 (c) Subject to NRS 211.007, ensure availability of multilingual forms,
31 identification tools or interpreter resources to assist in determining citizenship
32 during the intake process.
33 4. A court may consider the failure of a county or city jail to automatically
34 notify a consular post pursuant to subsection 1 in determining the admissibility of
35 statements made during a custodial interrogation or in evaluating compliance
36 with a constitutional, statutory or treaty obligation, but such a failure does not
37 automatically require dismissal of a charge against the prisoner.
38 5. The Peace Officers Standards and Training Commission, in consultation
39 with the Department of Public Safety, shall develop training materials and
40 procedures for law enforcement agencies concerning:
41 (a) The requirements for automatic consular notification under this section;
42 (b) The rights of foreign nationals under international law; and
43 (c) The procedures for identifying foreign nationals during the intake
44 process.] (Deleted by amendment.)
