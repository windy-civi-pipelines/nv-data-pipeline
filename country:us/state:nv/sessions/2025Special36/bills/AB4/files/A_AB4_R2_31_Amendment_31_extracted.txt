Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides that if a person commits an assault upon an officer who is
2 performing his or her duty and the person knew or should have known that the victim was an
3 officer, the person is guilty of: (1) a category B felony if the assault is made with the use of a
Senate Amendment No. 31 to Assembly Bill No. 4 Second Reprint Page 4
4 deadly weapon or the present ability to use a deadly weapon; (2) a category D felony if the
5 person is a probationer, prisoner or parolee; or (3) if neither of those circumstances is present,
6 a gross misdemeanor. (NRS 200.471) Additionally, existing law provides that if a person
7 commits a battery upon an officer and the person knew or should have known that the victim
8 was an officer, the person is guilty of: (1) a category B felony if the battery causes substantial
9 bodily harm or is committed by strangulation; or (2) if those circumstances are not present and
10 no greater penalty is provided by law, a gross misdemeanor. (NRS 200.481) Sections 1 and 2
11 of this bill revise the definition of “officer” for the purposes of the enhanced penalties for
12 assault or battery to include an employee of this State or a political subdivision of this State
13 whose normal job responsibilities require the employee to: (1) interact with the public; and (2)
14 perform tasks related to child welfare services or child protective services or tasks that expose
15 the person to comparable danger. Additionally, sections 1 and 2 apply the enhanced penalties
16 to an assault or battery committed against a hospitality employee.
17 Existing law prohibits a person from stalking and prescribes various penalties related to
18 the circumstance under which the offense is committed. (NRS 200.575) Section 3 of this bill
19 expands the unlawful acts which constitute stalking to include certain courses of conduct that
20 would cause the victim to feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated, harassed or fearful for the
21 immediate safety of a person in a dating relationship with the victim. Section 3 also makes
22 various changes to provide that stalking encompasses both acts committed in person and by
23 electronic means, and provides that such penalties are generally applicable to such acts
24 regardless of medium. Sections 25 and 45 of this bill make conforming changes related to the
25 commission of stalking by electronic means under section 3.
26 Existing law provides that it is unlawful for a person to knowingly and willfully have in
27 his or her possession: (1) any film, photograph or other visual representation depicting a
28 person under the age of 16 years as the subject of a sexual portrayal or engaging in or
29 simulating, or assisting others to engage in or simulate, sexual conduct; or (2) computer-
30 generated child sexual abuse material. (NRS 200.730) Section 4 of this bill revises the unit of
31 prosecution for such an offense and prescribes that each person depicted under the age of 16
32 years in any film, photograph or other visual presentation and each child depicted or
33 represented in any computer-generated child sexual abuse material, respectively, constitutes a
34 separate offense.
35 Existing law establishes certain crimes making it unlawful to take or obtain property.
36 (NRS 205.0821-205.295) Section 7 of this bill creates a new crime which provides that if a
37 person intentionally causes property damage to a retail establishment in the commission of a
38 theft offense and the aggregate value of the amount involved in the theft or property damage,
39 or any combination thereof, is $750 or more, the person is guilty of a category C felony.
40 Existing law sets forth certain unlawful acts that constitute domestic violence when
41 committed against certain persons. (NRS 33.018) Section 13 of this bill revises the unlawful
42 acts that constitute domestic violence to include kidnapping as well as an attempt or
43 solicitation to commit any unlawful act that constitutes domestic violence.
44 Existing law establishes provisions concerning actions for wrongful conviction. (NRS
45 41.900-41.970) Section 14 of this bill provides that the entry of a certificate of innocence and
46 the award in an action for wrongful conviction is not a finding that: (1) certain persons
47 committed a wrongdoing; or (2) there was not probable cause under certain circumstances.
48 Existing law provides that if a child who is alleged to be delinquent is taken into custody
49 and detained, the child must be given a detention hearing before the juvenile court. (NRS
50 62C.040) Section 15 of this bill requires the juvenile court to order a qualified professional to
51 evaluate the mental health of a child who: (1) is alleged to have committed certain unlawful
52 acts involving a battery against a school employee or a child welfare professional; and (2) has,
53 in the previous year, been taken into custody two or more times for certain battery offenses.
54 Section 16 of this bill makes a conforming change related to the detention of such children
55 under section 15.
56 Existing law requires a juvenile court to suspend the driver’s license of a juvenile under
57 certain circumstances if a child is adjudicated to be in need of supervision because the child:
58 (1) is a habitual truant; (2) committed certain unlawful acts related to tobacco; (3) committed
59 certain unlawful acts related to a controlled substance or alcohol; or (4) placed graffiti on or
60 defaced property. (NRS 62E.430, 62E.440, 62E.630, 62E.690) Sections 17-20 of this bill
61 make various changes to authorize the juvenile court to order the Department of Motor
62 Vehicles to issue a restricted driver’s license to the child if the issuance is in the best interest
Senate Amendment No. 31 to Assembly Bill No. 4 Second Reprint Page 5
63 of the child. Section 51 of this bill makes a conforming change regarding the circumstances
64 under which the Department of Motor Vehicles may issue a restricted driver’s license.
65 Existing law requires a court to discharge a defendant and dismiss the proceedings or set
66 aside the judgment of conviction upon completion of the terms and conditions related to a
67 program of treatment for alcohol or other substance use disorder, a program for treatment of
68 mental illness or a program of treatment for veterans and members of the military or certain
69 other terms and conditions. Thereafter, existing law requires the sealing of records related to
70 the discharge, dismissal or setting aside a judgment of conviction. (NRS 176.211, 176A.240,
71 176A.245, 176A.260, 176A.265, 176A.290, 176A.295) Sections 21-24 of this bill provide
72 that the automatic record sealing provisions do not apply to such persons who were charged
73 with certain offenses related to the abuse or neglect of a child or the abuse of an older or
74 vulnerable person.
75 Existing law requires a court to release any bail at the time of sentencing, if the court has
76 not already done so, unless the defendant owes fines and costs, in which case, the bail must be
77 applied towards the fines and costs. (NRS 178.522, 178.528) Section 29 of this bill provides
78 that under these circumstances if the bail has been deposited by a person other than a surety,
79 and upon notice and the agreement of the person, the bail must first be applied towards the
80 payment of any restitution owed by the defendant. Section 28 of this bill makes a conforming
81 change related to the procedures prescribed by section 29.
82 Existing law authorizes: (1) a district attorney and any attorney employed by a district
83 attorney to prosecute a person in a county other than the county by which the district attorney
84 is employed for the limited purpose of conducting a pretrial release hearing; and (2) such an
85 attorney to receive a stipend for being available on a weekend or holiday to serve as a
86 prosecuting attorney in a pretrial release hearing. (NRS 178.760) Section 30 of this bill
87 similarly authorizes a city attorney in a county whose population is less than 100,000
88 (currently all counties except Clark and Washoe Counties) to be deputized to prosecute a
89 person in the county that encompasses the city that employs the city attorney for the limited
90 purpose of serving as a prosecuting attorney in a pretrial release hearing, and authorizes the
91 city attorney to receive the stipend for such services.
92 Section 30.5 of this bill requires certain facilities in this State that hold a person in
93 custody under process of law or under lawful arrest to create and maintain a list that
94 includes, without limitation: (1) the name of each person held at the facility; and (2) the
95 name of the facility at which the person is held. Section 30.5 requires the facility to revise
96 the list in real time. Additionally, section 30.5 requires the facility to publicly display or
97 make immediately available on the request of any person the information related to the
98 name of the person and the facility at which the person is held.
99 Existing law authorizes the establishment of correctional programs and judicial programs
100 for the reentry of offenders and parolees into the community. (NRS 209.4871-209.4889)
101 Section 33 of this bill: (1) authorizes the Director of the Department of Corrections to
102 establish an alternative correctional program; and (2) provides for the qualification and
103 assignment offenders to the alternative correctional program. Section 33.5 of this bill requires
104 the Director to submit an annual report to the Interim Finance Committee relating to the
105 alternative correctional program. Section 42 of this bill authorizes an offender participating in
106 an alternative correctional program to waive his or her eligibility for, and release on, parole.
107 Section 43 of this bill establishes provisions related to the effect of such a waiver. Section 44
108 of this bill requires the State Board of Parole Commissioners to consider the removal of an
109 offender from an alternative correctional program in its determination of whether to release an
110 offender on parole. Sections 32, 35, 36 and 39-41 of this bill establish and revise various
111 provisions concerning the alternative correctional program.
112 Existing law authorizes the Director of the Department of Corrections and the sheriff,
113 chief of police or town marshal to establish programs for the treatment of prisoners with a
114 substance use disorder using medication-assisted treatment. (NRS 209.4247, 211.400)
115 Sections 34 and 37 of this bill require persons who establish such programs to collaborate
116 with the Department of Human Services if the program relates to opioid use disorder.
117 Existing law: (1) authorizes a board of county commissioners, with certain exceptions, to
118 exercise all powers necessary or proper to address matters of local concern for the effective
119 operation of a county government, whether or not the powers are expressly granted to the
120 board; and (2) defines “matter of local concern” for such purposes. (NRS 244.143, 244.146)
121 Existing law also authorizes a board of county commissioners to enact and enforce local
Senate Amendment No. 31 to Assembly Bill No. 4 Second Reprint Page 6
122 police and sanitary ordinances and regulations that are not in conflict with the general laws
123 and regulations of this State. (NRS 244.357) Section 46 of this bill requires a board of county
124 commissioners in a county whose population is 700,000 or more (currently only Clark
125 County) to adopt an ordinance that designates the geographic boundaries of one or more
126 corridors in which the commission of crime poses a significant risk to public safety and the
127 economic welfare of this State due to the high concentration of tourists, visitors, employees
128 and other persons in such corridors. Section 46 provides that a person who is charged with,
129 convicted of or the subject of deferred adjudication for any offense punishable as a
130 misdemeanor: (1) for the first offense within the corridor within 2 years, may as a condition of
131 release, sentencing, suspension of sentence or deferred adjudication, as applicable, be
132 prohibited from entering the corridor in which the offense occurred for a period not to exceed
133 1 year; and (2) for a second or subsequent offense within the corridor within 2 years, must as a
134 condition of release, sentencing, suspension of sentence or deferred adjudication, as
135 applicable, be prohibited from entering the corridor in which the offense occurred for a period
136 of not less than 1 year.
137 Section 9 of this bill authorizes a justice court, in a county wherein the board of county
138 commissioners adopts an ordinance designating the geographic boundaries of one or more
139 corridors pursuant to section 46, to establish an appropriate program for the adjudication of
140 offenses punishable as a misdemeanor that occurred within the boundaries of such corridors.
141 Section 10 of this bill requires a justice court whose jurisdiction includes a corridor
142 established pursuant to section 46 to prepare and submit: (1) to the Legislature an annual
143 report containing certain information regarding crimes that occur within such corridors; and
144 (2) to the respective board of county commissioners a monthly report containing certain
145 information regarding crimes that occur within such corridors.
146 Section 46.5 of this bill prohibits a school district, public school and any employee of
147 a school district or public school, except pursuant to a lawful court order, warrant or
148 subpoena, or as required by certain other circumstances, from providing a law
149 enforcement officer who is carrying out official duties: (1) permission to access the
150 grounds, buildings or facilities of a school district or public school; or (2) certain
151 educational information about a pupil or the family or household of a pupil. Section 46.5
152 provides that a violation of this prohibition subjects the person who violated the
153 provision to disciplinary action by the school district or public school that employs the
154 person.
155 Existing law requires the Department of Human Services: (1) to conduct a statewide
156 needs assessment to determine the priorities for allocating money from the Fund for a
157 Resilient Nevada; and (2) based on that needs assessment, to develop a statewide plan for
158 allocating the money in the Fund. (NRS 433.732, 433.734) Existing law also prescribes
159 specific requirements concerning the statewide needs assessment. (NRS 433.736) Section 50
160 of this bill requires the statewide needs assessment to identify educational resources to be used
161 for the training of law enforcement and other criminal justice agencies related to trauma-
162 informed practices and medication-assisted treatment for persons with opioid use disorder.

167 available certain information relating to peer recovery support services. Sections 48 and 56-
168 58 of this bill make conforming changes governing the applicability of section 47 to certain
169 existing provisions of law related to peer support services.
170 Existing law sets forth various penalties involving driving or operating a vehicle or vessel
171 under the influence of alcohol, a controlled substance or a prohibited substance under certain
172 circumstances. (Chapter 484C of NRS, NRS 488.400-488.520) Sections 52 and 54 of this bill
173 provide that the prohibition on a person driving or operating a vehicle or vessel with a specific
174 amount of marijuana or marijuana metabolite in his or her blood applies to certain offenses
175 punishable as a felony. Sections 53 and 55 of this bill increase the terms of imprisonment for
176 a person who proximately causes the death of another person while driving or operating a
177 vehicle or vessel under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance. Additionally,
178 sections 53 and 55 further provide that any such person who proximately causes the death of

Senate Amendment No. 31 to Assembly Bill No. 4 Second Reprint Page 7
180 relating to driving or operating a vehicle or vessel under the influence of alcohol or a
181 controlled substance is subject to an increased penalty.
182 During the 2021 Legislative Session, the Legislature made an appropriation to the
183 Department of Corrections for the reintegration of the Offender Sentence Management
184 System into the Nevada Offender Tracking Information System. Any remaining balance of
185 that appropriation was required to be reverted to the State General Fund on or before
186 September 15, 2023. (Section 2 of chapter 463, Statutes of Nevada 2021, at page 2875)
187 During the 2023 and 2025 Legislative Sessions, the Legislature extended the reversion date to
188 September 19, 2025, and September 17, 2027, respectively. Section 58.1 of this bill extends
189 the reversion date to September 21, 2029.
190 Existing law authorizes an offender to earn certain credits to reduce the sentence of
191 imprisonment of the offender. (NRS 209.432-209.449) During the 2023 Legislative Session,
192 the Legislature established a revised method for awarding credits to reduce the sentence of an
193 offender that applied to an offender sentenced to a crime committed: (1) on or after July 1,
194 2025; or (2) before July 1, 2025, if the offender elected to be subject to the revised method.
195 (NRS 209.4467) During the 2025 Legislative Session, the Legislature delayed the
196 implementation of the revised method to July 1, 2026. Sections 58.2-58.7 of this bill further
197 delay the implementation of the revised method to July 1, 2027. Additionally, section 58.2
