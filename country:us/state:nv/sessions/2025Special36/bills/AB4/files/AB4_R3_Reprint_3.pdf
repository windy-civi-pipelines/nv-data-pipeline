Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides that if a person commits an assault upon an officer who
2 is performing his or her duty and the person knew or should have known that the
3 victim was an officer, the person is guilty of: (1) a category B felony if the assault
4 is made with the use of a deadly weapon or the present ability to use a deadly
5 weapon; (2) a category D felony if the person is a probationer, prisoner or parolee;
6 or (3) if neither of those circumstances is present, a gross misdemeanor. (NRS
7 200.471) Additionally, existing law provides that if a person commits a battery
8 upon an officer and the person knew or should have known that the victim was an
9 officer, the person is guilty of: (1) a category B felony if the battery causes
10 substantial bodily harm or is committed by strangulation; or (2) if those
11 circumstances are not present and no greater penalty is provided by law, a gross
12 misdemeanor. (NRS 200.481) Sections 1 and 2 of this bill revise the definition of
13 “officer” for the purposes of the enhanced penalties for assault or battery to include
14 an employee of this State or a political subdivision of this State whose normal job
15 responsibilities require the employee to: (1) interact with the public; and (2)
16 perform tasks related to child welfare services or child protective services or tasks
17 that expose the person to comparable danger. Additionally, sections 1 and 2 apply
18 the enhanced penalties to an assault or battery committed against a hospitality
19 employee.
20 Existing law prohibits a person from stalking and prescribes various penalties
21 related to the circumstance under which the offense is committed. (NRS 200.575)
22 Section 3 of this bill expands the unlawful acts which constitute stalking to include
23 certain courses of conduct that would cause the victim to feel terrorized, frightened,
24 intimidated, harassed or fearful for the immediate safety of a person in a dating
25 relationship with the victim. Section 3 also makes various changes to provide that
26 stalking encompasses both acts committed in person and by electronic means, and
27 provides that such penalties are generally applicable to such acts regardless of
28 medium. Sections 25 and 45 of this bill make conforming changes related to the
29 commission of stalking by electronic means under section 3.
30 Existing law provides that it is unlawful for a person to knowingly and willfully
31 have in his or her possession: (1) any film, photograph or other visual
32 representation depicting a person under the age of 16 years as the subject of a
33 sexual portrayal or engaging in or simulating, or assisting others to engage in or
34 simulate, sexual conduct; or (2) computer-generated child sexual abuse material.
35 (NRS 200.730) Section 4 of this bill revises the unit of prosecution for such an
36 offense and prescribes that each person depicted under the age of 16 years in any
37 film, photograph or other visual presentation and each child depicted or represented
38 in any computer-generated child sexual abuse material, respectively, constitutes a
39 separate offense.
40 Existing law establishes certain crimes making it unlawful to take or obtain
41 property. (NRS 205.0821-205.295) Section 7 of this bill creates a new crime which
42 provides that if a person intentionally causes property damage to a retail
43 establishment in the commission of a theft offense and the aggregate value of the
44 amount involved in the theft or property damage, or any combination thereof, is
45 $750 or more, the person is guilty of a category C felony.
46 Existing law sets forth certain unlawful acts that constitute domestic violence
47 when committed against certain persons. (NRS 33.018) Section 13 of this bill
48 revises the unlawful acts that constitute domestic violence to include kidnapping as
-

49 well as an attempt or solicitation to commit any unlawful act that constitutes
50 domestic violence.
51 Existing law establishes provisions concerning actions for wrongful conviction.
52 (NRS 41.900-41.970) Section 14 of this bill provides that the entry of a certificate
53 of innocence and the award in an action for wrongful conviction is not a finding
54 that: (1) certain persons committed a wrongdoing; or (2) there was not probable
55 cause under certain circumstances.
56 Existing law provides that if a child who is alleged to be delinquent is taken
57 into custody and detained, the child must be given a detention hearing before the
58 juvenile court. (NRS 62C.040) Section 15 of this bill requires the juvenile court to
59 order a qualified professional to evaluate the mental health of a child who: (1) is
60 alleged to have committed certain unlawful acts involving a battery against a school
61 employee or a child welfare professional; and (2) has, in the previous year, been
62 taken into custody two or more times for certain battery offenses. Section 16 of this
63 bill makes a conforming change related to the detention of such children under
64 section 15.
65 Existing law requires a juvenile court to suspend the driver’s license of a
66 juvenile under certain circumstances if a child is adjudicated to be in need of
67 supervision because the child: (1) is a habitual truant; (2) committed certain
68 unlawful acts related to tobacco; (3) committed certain unlawful acts related to a
69 controlled substance or alcohol; or (4) placed graffiti on or defaced property. (NRS
70 62E.430, 62E.440, 62E.630, 62E.690) Sections 17-20 of this bill make various
71 changes to authorize the juvenile court to order the Department of Motor Vehicles
72 to issue a restricted driver’s license to the child if the issuance is in the best interest
73 of the child. Section 51 of this bill makes a conforming change regarding the
74 circumstances under which the Department of Motor Vehicles may issue a
75 restricted driver’s license.
76 Existing law requires a court to discharge a defendant and dismiss the
77 proceedings or set aside the judgment of conviction upon completion of the terms
78 and conditions related to a program of treatment for alcohol or other substance use
79 disorder, a program for treatment of mental illness or a program of treatment for
80 veterans and members of the military or certain other terms and conditions.
81 Thereafter, existing law requires the sealing of records related to the discharge,
82 dismissal or setting aside a judgment of conviction. (NRS 176.211, 176A.240,
83 176A.245, 176A.260, 176A.265, 176A.290, 176A.295) Sections 21-24 of this bill
84 provide that the automatic record sealing provisions do not apply to such persons
85 who were charged with certain offenses related to the abuse or neglect of a child or
86 the abuse of an older or vulnerable person.
87 Existing law requires a court to release any bail at the time of sentencing, if the
88 court has not already done so, unless the defendant owes fines and costs, in which
89 case, the bail must be applied towards the fines and costs. (NRS 178.522, 178.528)
90 Section 29 of this bill provides that under these circumstances if the bail has been
91 deposited by a person other than a surety, and upon notice and the agreement of the
92 person, the bail must first be applied towards the payment of any restitution owed
93 by the defendant. Section 28 of this bill makes a conforming change related to the
94 procedures prescribed by section 29.
95 Existing law authorizes: (1) a district attorney and any attorney employed by a
96 district attorney to prosecute a person in a county other than the county by which
97 the district attorney is employed for the limited purpose of conducting a pretrial
98 release hearing; and (2) such an attorney to receive a stipend for being available on
99 a weekend or holiday to serve as a prosecuting attorney in a pretrial release hearing.
100 (NRS 178.760) Section 30 of this bill similarly authorizes a city attorney in a
101 county whose population is less than 100,000 (currently all counties except Clark
102 and Washoe Counties) to be deputized to prosecute a person in the county that
103 encompasses the city that employs the city attorney for the limited purpose of

105 city attorney to receive the stipend for such services.
106 Section 30.5 of this bill requires certain facilities in this State that hold a person
107 in custody under process of law or under lawful arrest to create and maintain a list
108 that includes, without limitation: (1) the name of each person held at the facility;
109 and (2) the name of the facility at which the person is held. Section 30.5 requires
110 the facility to revise the list in real time. Additionally, section 30.5 requires the
111 facility to publicly display or make immediately available on the request of any
112 person the information related to the name of the person and the facility at which
113 the person is held.
114 Existing law authorizes the establishment of correctional programs and judicial

123 on, parole. Section 43 of this bill establishes provisions related to the effect of such
124 a waiver. Section 44 of this bill requires the State Board of Parole Commissioners
125 to consider the removal of an offender from an alternative correctional program in

127 and 39-41 of this bill establish and revise various provisions concerning the
128 alternative correctional program.
129 Existing law authorizes the Director of the Department of Corrections and the

134 program relates to opioid use disorder.
135 Existing law: (1) authorizes a board of county commissioners, with certain

144 Clark County) to adopt an ordinance that designates the geographic boundaries of
