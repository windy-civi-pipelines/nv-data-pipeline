Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides that if a person commits an assault upon an officer who
2 is performing his or her duty and the person knew or should have known that the
3 victim was an officer, the person is guilty of: (1) a category B felony if the assault
4 is made with the use of a deadly weapon or the present ability to use a deadly
5 weapon; (2) a category D felony if the person is a probationer, prisoner or parolee;
6 or (3) if neither of those circumstances is present, a gross misdemeanor. (NRS
7 200.471) Additionally, existing law provides that if a person commits a battery
8 upon an officer and the person knew or should have known that the victim was an
9 officer, the person is guilty of: (1) a category B felony if the battery causes
10 substantial bodily harm or is committed by strangulation; or (2) if those
11 circumstances are not present and no greater penalty is provided by law, a gross
12 misdemeanor. (NRS 200.481) Sections 1 and 2 of this bill revise the definition of
13 “officer” for the purposes of the enhanced penalties for assault or battery to include
14 an employee of this State or a political subdivision of this State whose normal job
15 responsibilities require the employee to: (1) interact with the public; and (2)
16 perform tasks related to child welfare services or child protective services or tasks
17 that expose the person to comparable danger. Additionally, sections 1 and 2 apply
18 the enhanced penalties to an assault or battery committed against a hospitality
19 employee.
20 Existing law prohibits a person from stalking and prescribes various penalties
21 related to the circumstance under which the offense is committed. (NRS 200.575)
22 Section 3 of this bill expands the unlawful acts which constitute stalking to include
23 certain courses of conduct that would cause the victim to feel terrorized, frightened,
24 intimidated, harassed or fearful for the immediate safety of a person in a dating
25 relationship with the victim. Section 3 also makes various changes to provide that
26 stalking encompasses both acts committed in person and by electronic means, and
27 provides that such penalties are generally applicable to such acts regardless of
28 medium. Sections 25 and 45 of this bill make conforming changes related to the
29 commission of stalking by electronic means under section 3.
30 Existing law provides that it is unlawful for a person to knowingly and willfully
31 have in his or her possession: (1) any film, photograph or other visual
32 representation depicting a person under the age of 16 years as the subject of a
33 sexual portrayal or engaging in or simulating, or assisting others to engage in or
34 simulate, sexual conduct; or (2) computer-generated child sexual abuse material.
35 (NRS 200.730) Section 4 of this bill revises the unit of prosecution for such an
36 offense and prescribes that each person depicted under the age of 16 years in any
37 film, photograph or other visual presentation and each child depicted or represented
38 in any computer-generated child sexual abuse material, respectively, constitutes a
39 separate offense.
40 Existing law: (1) prescribes various circumstances in which a person is
41 prohibited from owning, possessing or having under his or her custody or control a
42 firearm; and (2) establishes procedures related to the surrender, sale or transfer of a
43 firearm by certain persons who are prohibited from owning, possessing or having
44 under their custody or control a firearm. (NRS 33.031, 33.033, 202.360, 202.361)
45 Sections 5, 11 and 26 of this bill generally require a court to schedule a compliance
46 hearing under such circumstances to determine whether a person has complied with
47 a court order to surrender, sell or transfer a firearm. Sections 5, 11 and 26,
48 however, authorize the court to cancel the compliance hearing under certain
49 circumstances. Sections 6, 12 and 27 of this bill apply certain related definitions in
50 existing law to sections 5, 11 and 26, respectively.
51 Existing law establishes certain crimes making it unlawful to take or obtain
52 property. (NRS 205.0821-205.295) Section 7 of this bill creates a new crime which
53 provides that if a person intentionally causes property damage to a retail
54 establishment in the commission of a theft offense and the aggregate value of the
-
*AB4*

55 amount involved in the theft or property damage, or any combination thereof, is
56 $750 or more, the person is guilty of a category C felony.
57 Existing law sets forth certain unlawful acts that constitute domestic violence
58 when committed against certain persons. (NRS 33.018) Section 13 of this bill
59 revises the unlawful acts that constitute domestic violence to include kidnapping as
60 well as an attempt or solicitation to commit any unlawful act that constitutes
61 domestic violence.
62 Existing law establishes provisions concerning actions for wrongful conviction.
63 (NRS 41.900-41.970) Section 14 of this bill provides that the entry of a certificate
64 of innocence and the award in an action for wrongful conviction is not a finding
65 that: (1) certain persons committed a wrongdoing; or (2) there was not probable
66 cause under certain circumstances.
67 Existing law provides that if a child who is alleged to be delinquent is taken
68 into custody and detained, the child must be given a detention hearing before the
69 juvenile court. (NRS 62C.040) Section 15 of this bill requires the juvenile court to
70 order a qualified professional to evaluate the mental health of a child who: (1) is
71 alleged to have committed certain unlawful acts involving a battery against a school
72 employee or a child welfare professional; and (2) has, in the previous year, been
73 taken into custody two or more times for certain battery offenses. Section 16 of this
74 bill makes a conforming change related to the detention of such children under
75 section 15.
76 Existing law requires a juvenile court to suspend the driver’s license of a
77 juvenile under certain circumstances if a child is adjudicated to be in need of
78 supervision because the child: (1) is a habitual truant; (2) committed certain
79 unlawful acts related to tobacco; (3) committed certain unlawful acts related to a
80 controlled substance or alcohol; or (4) placed graffiti on or defaced property. (NRS
81 62E.430, 62E.440, 62E.630, 62E.690) Sections 17-20 of this bill make various
82 changes to authorize the juvenile court to order the Department of Motor Vehicles
83 to issue a restricted driver’s license to the child if the issuance is in the best interest
84 of the child. Section 51 of this bill makes a conforming change regarding the
85 circumstances under which the Department of Motor Vehicles may issue a
86 restricted driver’s license.
87 Existing law requires a court to discharge a defendant and dismiss the
88 proceedings or set aside the judgment of conviction upon completion of the terms
89 and conditions related to a program of treatment for alcohol or other substance use
90 disorder, a program for treatment of mental illness or a program of treatment for
91 veterans and members of the military or certain other terms and conditions.
92 Thereafter, existing law requires the sealing of records related to the discharge,
93 dismissal or setting aside a judgment of conviction. (NRS 176.211, 176A.240,
94 176A.245, 176A.260, 176A.265, 176A.290, 176A.295) Sections 21-24 of this bill
95 provide that the automatic record sealing provisions do not apply to such persons
96 who were charged with certain offenses related to the abuse or neglect of a child or
97 the abuse of an older or vulnerable person.
98 Existing law requires a court to release any bail at the time of sentencing, if the
99 court has not already done so, unless the defendant owes fines and costs, in which
100 case, the bail must be applied towards the fines and costs. (NRS 178.522, 178.528)
101 Section 29 of this bill provides that under these circumstances if the bail has been
102 deposited by a person other than a surety, and upon notice and the agreement of the
103 person, the bail must first be applied towards the payment of any restitution owed
104 by the defendant. Section 28 of this bill makes a conforming change related to the
105 procedures prescribed by section 29.
106 Existing law authorizes: (1) a district attorney and any attorney employed by a
107 district attorney to prosecute a person in a county other than the county by which
108 the district attorney is employed for the limited purpose of conducting a pretrial
109 release hearing; and (2) such an attorney to receive a stipend for being available on

111 (NRS 178.760) Section 30 of this bill similarly authorizes a city attorney in a
112 county whose population is less than 100,000 (currently all counties except Clark
113 and Washoe Counties) to be deputized to prosecute a person in the county that
114 encompasses the city that employs the city attorney for the limited purpose of
115 serving as a prosecuting attorney in a pretrial release hearing, and authorizes the
116 city attorney to receive the stipend for such services.
117 Existing law authorizes the establishment of correctional programs and judicial
118 programs for the reentry of offenders and parolees into the community. (NRS
119 209.4871-209.4889) Section 33 of this bill: (1) authorizes the Director of the
120 Department of Corrections to establish an alternative correctional program; and (2)
121 provides for the qualification and assignment offenders to the alternative
122 correctional program. Section 42 of this bill authorizes an offender participating in
123 an alternative correctional program to waive his or her eligibility for, and release
124 on, parole. Section 43 of this bill establishes provisions related to the effect of such
125 a waiver. Section 44 of this bill requires the State Board of Parole Commissioners
126 to consider the removal of an offender from an alternative correctional program in

132 prisoners with a substance use disorder using medication-assisted treatment. (NRS
133 209.4247, 211.400) Sections 34 and 37 of this bill require persons who establish
134 such programs to collaborate with the Department of Human Services if the
135 program relates to opioid use disorder.
136 Existing law: (1) authorizes a board of county commissioners, with certain
137 exceptions, to exercise all powers necessary or proper to address matters of local
138 concern for the effective operation of a county government, whether or not the

140 for such purposes. (NRS 244.143, 244.146) Existing law also authorizes a board of

149 provides that a person who is charged with, convicted of or the subject of deferred

190 person driving or operating a vehicle or vessel with a specific amount of marijuana
191 or marijuana metabolite in his or her blood applies to certain offenses punishable as
192 a felony. Sections 53 and 55 of this bill increase the terms of imprisonment for a

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides that if a person commits an assault upon an officer who
2 is performing his or her duty and the person knew or should have known that the
3 victim was an officer, the person is guilty of: (1) a category B felony if the assault
4 is made with the use of a deadly weapon or the present ability to use a deadly
5 weapon; (2) a category D felony if the person is a probationer, prisoner or parolee;
6 or (3) if neither of those circumstances is present, a gross misdemeanor. (NRS
7 200.471) Additionally, existing law provides that if a person commits a battery
8 upon an officer and the person knew or should have known that the victim was an
9 officer, the person is guilty of: (1) a category B felony if the battery causes
10 substantial bodily harm or is committed by strangulation; or (2) if those
11 circumstances are not present and no greater penalty is provided by law, a gross
12 misdemeanor. (NRS 200.481) Sections 1 and 2 of this bill revise the definition of
13 “officer” for the purposes of the enhanced penalties for assault or battery to include
14 an employee of this State or a political subdivision of this State whose normal job
15 responsibilities require the employee to: (1) interact with the public; and (2)
16 perform tasks related to child welfare services or child protective services or tasks
17 that expose the person to comparable danger. Additionally, sections 1 and 2 apply
18 the enhanced penalties to an assault or battery committed against a hospitality
19 employee.
20 Existing law prohibits a person from stalking and prescribes various penalties
21 related to the circumstance under which the offense is committed. (NRS 200.575)
22 Section 3 of this bill expands the unlawful acts which constitute stalking to include
23 certain courses of conduct that would cause the victim to feel terrorized, frightened,
24 intimidated, harassed or fearful for the immediate safety of a person in a dating
25 relationship with the victim. Section 3 also makes various changes to provide that
26 stalking encompasses both acts committed in person and by electronic means, and
27 provides that such penalties are generally applicable to such acts regardless of
28 medium. Sections 25 and 45 of this bill make conforming changes related to the
29 commission of stalking by electronic means under section 3.
30 Existing law provides that it is unlawful for a person to knowingly and willfully
31 have in his or her possession: (1) any film, photograph or other visual
32 representation depicting a person under the age of 16 years as the subject of a
33 sexual portrayal or engaging in or simulating, or assisting others to engage in or
34 simulate, sexual conduct; or (2) computer-generated child sexual abuse material.
35 (NRS 200.730) Section 4 of this bill revises the unit of prosecution for such an
36 offense and prescribes that each person depicted under the age of 16 years in any
37 film, photograph or other visual presentation and each child depicted or represented
38 in any computer-generated child sexual abuse material, respectively, constitutes a
39 separate offense.
40 Existing law: (1) prescribes various circumstances in which a person is
41 prohibited from owning, possessing or having under his or her custody or control a
42 firearm; and (2) establishes procedures related to the surrender, sale or transfer of a
43 firearm by certain persons who are prohibited from owning, possessing or having
44 under their custody or control a firearm. (NRS 33.031, 33.033, 202.360, 202.361)
45 Sections 5, 11 and 26 of this bill generally require a court to schedule a compliance
46 hearing under such circumstances to determine whether a person has complied with
47 a court order to surrender, sell or transfer a firearm. Sections 5, 11 and 26,
48 however, authorize the court to cancel the compliance hearing under certain
49 circumstances. Sections 6, 12 and 27 of this bill apply certain related definitions in
50 existing law to sections 5, 11 and 26, respectively.
51 Existing law establishes certain crimes making it unlawful to take or obtain
52 property. (NRS 205.0821-205.295) Section 7 of this bill creates a new crime which
53 provides that if a person intentionally causes property damage to a retail
54 establishment in the commission of a theft offense and the aggregate value of the
-
*AB4*

– 3 –
55 amount involved in the theft or property damage, or any combination thereof, is
56 $750 or more, the person is guilty of a category C felony.
57 Existing law sets forth certain unlawful acts that constitute domestic violence
58 when committed against certain persons. (NRS 33.018) Section 13 of this bill
59 revises the unlawful acts that constitute domestic violence to include kidnapping as
60 well as an attempt or solicitation to commit any unlawful act that constitutes
61 domestic violence.
62 Existing law establishes provisions concerning actions for wrongful conviction.
63 (NRS 41.900-41.970) Section 14 of this bill provides that the entry of a certificate
64 of innocence and the award in an action for wrongful conviction is not a finding
65 that: (1) certain persons committed a wrongdoing; or (2) there was not probable
66 cause under certain circumstances.
67 Existing law provides that if a child who is alleged to be delinquent is taken
68 into custody and detained, the child must be given a detention hearing before the
69 juvenile court. (NRS 62C.040) Section 15 of this bill requires the juvenile court to
70 order a qualified professional to evaluate the mental health of a child who: (1) is
71 alleged to have committed certain unlawful acts involving a battery against a school
72 employee or a child welfare professional; and (2) has, in the previous year, been
73 taken into custody two or more times for certain battery offenses. Section 16 of this
74 bill makes a conforming change related to the detention of such children under
75 section 15.
76 Existing law requires a juvenile court to suspend the driver’s license of a
77 juvenile under certain circumstances if a child is adjudicated to be in need of
78 supervision because the child: (1) is a habitual truant; (2) committed certain
79 unlawful acts related to tobacco; (3) committed certain unlawful acts related to a
80 controlled substance or alcohol; or (4) placed graffiti on or defaced property. (NRS
81 62E.430, 62E.440, 62E.630, 62E.690) Sections 17-20 of this bill make various
82 changes to authorize the juvenile court to order the Department of Motor Vehicles
83 to issue a restricted driver’s license to the child if the issuance is in the best interest
84 of the child. Section 51 of this bill makes a conforming change regarding the
85 circumstances under which the Department of Motor Vehicles may issue a
86 restricted driver’s license.
87 Existing law requires a court to discharge a defendant and dismiss the
88 proceedings or set aside the judgment of conviction upon completion of the terms
89 and conditions related to a program of treatment for alcohol or other substance use
90 disorder, a program for treatment of mental illness or a program of treatment for
91 veterans and members of the military or certain other terms and conditions.
92 Thereafter, existing law requires the sealing of records related to the discharge,
93 dismissal or setting aside a judgment of conviction. (NRS 176.211, 176A.240,
94 176A.245, 176A.260, 176A.265, 176A.290, 176A.295) Sections 21-24 of this bill
95 provide that the automatic record sealing provisions do not apply to such persons
96 who were charged with certain offenses related to the abuse or neglect of a child or
97 the abuse of an older or vulnerable person.
98 Existing law requires a court to release any bail at the time of sentencing, if the
99 court has not already done so, unless the defendant owes fines and costs, in which
100 case, the bail must be applied towards the fines and costs. (NRS 178.522, 178.528)
101 Section 29 of this bill provides that under these circumstances if the bail has been
102 deposited by a person other than a surety, and upon notice and the agreement of the
103 person, the bail must first be applied towards the payment of any restitution owed
104 by the defendant. Section 28 of this bill makes a conforming change related to the
105 procedures prescribed by section 29.
106 Existing law authorizes: (1) a district attorney and any attorney employed by a
107 district attorney to prosecute a person in a county other than the county by which
108 the district attorney is employed for the limited purpose of conducting a pretrial
109 release hearing; and (2) such an attorney to receive a stipend for being available on
-

– 4 –
110 a weekend or holiday to serve as a prosecuting attorney in a pretrial release hearing.
111 (NRS 178.760) Section 30 of this bill similarly authorizes a city attorney in a
112 county whose population is less than 100,000 (currently all counties except Clark
113 and Washoe Counties) to be deputized to prosecute a person in the county that
114 encompasses the city that employs the city attorney for the limited purpose of
115 serving as a prosecuting attorney in a pretrial release hearing, and authorizes the
116 city attorney to receive the stipend for such services.
117 Existing law authorizes the establishment of correctional programs and judicial
118 programs for the reentry of offenders and parolees into the community. (NRS
119 209.4871-209.4889) Section 33 of this bill: (1) authorizes the Director of the
120 Department of Corrections to establish an alternative correctional program; and (2)
121 provides for the qualification and assignment offenders to the alternative
122 correctional program. Section 42 of this bill authorizes an offender participating in
123 an alternative correctional program to waive his or her eligibility for, and release
124 on, parole. Section 43 of this bill establishes provisions related to the effect of such
125 a waiver. Section 44 of this bill requires the State Board of Parole Commissioners
126 to consider the removal of an offender from an alternative correctional program in
127 its determination of whether to release an offender on parole. Sections 32, 35, 36
128 and 39-41 of this bill establish and revise various provisions concerning the
129 alternative correctional program.
130 Existing law authorizes the Director of the Department of Corrections and the
131 sheriff, chief of police or town marshal to establish programs for the treatment of
132 prisoners with a substance use disorder using medication-assisted treatment. (NRS
133 209.4247, 211.400) Sections 34 and 37 of this bill require persons who establish
134 such programs to collaborate with the Department of Human Services if the
135 program relates to opioid use disorder.
136 Existing law: (1) authorizes a board of county commissioners, with certain
137 exceptions, to exercise all powers necessary or proper to address matters of local
138 concern for the effective operation of a county government, whether or not the
139 powers are expressly granted to the board; and (2) defines “matter of local concern”
140 for such purposes. (NRS 244.143, 244.146) Existing law also authorizes a board of
141 county commissioners to enact and enforce local police and sanitary ordinances and
142 regulations that are not in conflict with the general laws and regulations of this
143 State. (NRS 244.357) Section 46 of this bill requires a board of county
144 commissioners in a county whose population is 700,000 or more (currently only
145 Clark County) to adopt an ordinance that designates the geographic boundaries of
146 one or more corridors in which the commission of crime poses a significant risk to
147 public safety and the economic welfare of this State due to the high concentration
148 of tourists, visitors, employees and other persons in such corridors. Section 46
149 provides that a person who is charged with, convicted of or the subject of deferred
150 adjudication for any offense punishable as a misdemeanor: (1) for the first offense
151 within the corridor within 2 years, may as a condition of release, sentencing,
152 suspension of sentence or deferred adjudication, as applicable, be prohibited from
153 entering the corridor in which the offense occurred for a period not to exceed 1
154 year; and (2) for a second or subsequent offense within the corridor within 2 years,
155 must as a condition of release, sentencing, suspension of sentence or deferred
156 adjudication, as applicable, be prohibited from entering the corridor in which the
157 offense occurred for a period of not less than 1 year.
158 Section 9 of this bill authorizes a justice court, in a county wherein the board of
159 county commissioners adopts an ordinance designating the geographic boundaries
160 of one or more corridors pursuant to section 46, to establish an appropriate program
161 for the adjudication of offenses punishable as a misdemeanor that occurred within
162 the boundaries of such corridors.
163 Section 10 of this bill requires a justice court whose jurisdiction includes a
164 corridor established pursuant to section 46 to prepare and submit: (1) to the
-
*AB4*

– 5 –
165 Legislature an annual report containing certain information regarding crimes that
166 occur within such corridors; and (2) to the respective board of county
167 commissioners a monthly report containing certain information regarding crimes
168 that occur within such corridors.
169 Existing law requires the Department of Human Services: (1) to conduct a
170 statewide needs assessment to determine the priorities for allocating money from
171 the Fund for a Resilient Nevada; and (2) based on that needs assessment, to develop
172 a statewide plan for allocating the money in the Fund. (NRS 433.732, 433.734)
173 Existing law also prescribes specific requirements concerning the statewide needs
174 assessment. (NRS 433.736) Section 50 of this bill requires the statewide needs
175 assessment to identify educational resources to be used for the training of law
176 enforcement and other criminal justice agencies related to trauma-informed
177 practices and medication-assisted treatment for persons with opioid use disorder.
178 Section 49 of this bill makes a conforming change to refer to provisions
179 renumbered by section 50.
180 Existing law establishes provisions related to peer recovery support services.
181 (NRS 433.622-433.641) Section 47 of this bill requires the Department of Human
182 Services to make available certain information relating to peer recovery support
183 services. Sections 48 and 56-58 of this bill make conforming changes governing
184 the applicability of section 47 to certain existing provisions of law related to peer
185 support services.
186 Existing law sets forth various penalties involving driving or operating a
187 vehicle or vessel under the influence of alcohol, a controlled substance or a
188 prohibited substance under certain circumstances. (Chapter 484C of NRS, NRS
189 488.400-488.520) Sections 52 and 54 of this bill provide that the prohibition on a
190 person driving or operating a vehicle or vessel with a specific amount of marijuana
191 or marijuana metabolite in his or her blood applies to certain offenses punishable as
192 a felony. Sections 53 and 55 of this bill increase the terms of imprisonment for a
193 person who proximately causes the death of another person while driving or
194 operating a vehicle or vessel under the influence of alcohol or a controlled
195 substance. Additionally, sections 53 and 55 further provide that any such person
196 who proximately causes the death of another person and who has previously been
197 once or twice convicted of certain offenses relating to driving or operating a vehicle
198 or vessel under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance is subject to an
199 increased penalty.
200 Sections 59 and 60 make appropriations to the Interim Finance Committee for
201 allocation to the Administrative Office of the Courts and the Department of
202 Corrections, respectively, for the purposes of carrying out the provisions of this bill.
