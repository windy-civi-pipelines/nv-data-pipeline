Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides that if a person commits an assault upon an officer who
2 is performing his or her duty and the person knew or should have known that the
3 victim was an officer, the person is guilty of: (1) a category B felony if the assault
4 is made with the use of a deadly weapon or the present ability to use a deadly
5 weapon; (2) a category D felony if the person is a probationer, prisoner or parolee;
6 or (3) if neither of those circumstances is present, a gross misdemeanor. (NRS
7 200.471) Additionally, existing law provides that if a person commits a battery
8 upon an officer and the person knew or should have known that the victim was an
9 officer, the person is guilty of: (1) a category B felony if the battery causes
10 substantial bodily harm or is committed by strangulation; or (2) if those
11 circumstances are not present and no greater penalty is provided by law, a gross
12 misdemeanor. (NRS 200.481) Sections 1 and 2 of this bill revise the definition of
13 “officer” for the purposes of the enhanced penalties for assault or battery to include
14 an employee of this State or a political subdivision of this State whose normal job
15 responsibilities require the employee to: (1) interact with the public; and (2)
16 perform tasks related to child welfare services or child protective services or tasks
17 that expose the person to comparable danger. Additionally, sections 1 and 2 apply
18 the enhanced penalties to an assault or battery committed against a hospitality
19 employee.
20 Existing law prohibits a person from stalking and prescribes various penalties
21 related to the circumstance under which the offense is committed. (NRS 200.575)
22 Section 3 of this bill expands the unlawful acts which constitute stalking to include
23 certain courses of conduct that would cause the victim to feel terrorized, frightened,
24 intimidated, harassed or fearful for the immediate safety of a person in a dating
25 relationship with the victim. Section 3 also makes various changes to provide that
26 stalking encompasses both acts committed in person and by electronic means, and
27 provides that such penalties are generally applicable to such acts regardless of
28 medium. Sections 25 and 45 of this bill make conforming changes related to the
29 commission of stalking by electronic means under section 3.
30 Existing law provides that it is unlawful for a person to knowingly and willfully
31 have in his or her possession: (1) any film, photograph or other visual
32 representation depicting a person under the age of 16 years as the subject of a
33 sexual portrayal or engaging in or simulating, or assisting others to engage in or
34 simulate, sexual conduct; or (2) computer-generated child sexual abuse material.
35 (NRS 200.730) Section 4 of this bill revises the unit of prosecution for such an
36 offense and prescribes that each person depicted under the age of 16 years in any
37 film, photograph or other visual presentation and each child depicted or represented
38 in any computer-generated child sexual abuse material, respectively, constitutes a
39 separate offense.
40 Existing law establishes certain crimes making it unlawful to take or obtain
41 property. (NRS 205.0821-205.295) Section 7 of this bill creates a new crime which
42 provides that if a person intentionally causes property damage to a retail
43 establishment in the commission of a theft offense and the aggregate value of the
44 amount involved in the theft or property damage, or any combination thereof, is
45 $750 or more, the person is guilty of a category C felony.
46 Existing law sets forth certain unlawful acts that constitute domestic violence
47 when committed against certain persons. (NRS 33.018) Section 13 of this bill
48 revises the unlawful acts that constitute domestic violence to include kidnapping as
49 well as an attempt or solicitation to commit any unlawful act that constitutes
50 domestic violence.
51 Existing law establishes provisions concerning actions for wrongful conviction.
52 (NRS 41.900-41.970) Section 14 of this bill provides that the entry of a certificate
53 of innocence and the award in an action for wrongful conviction is not a finding

54 that: (1) certain persons committed a wrongdoing; or (2) there was not probable
55 cause under certain circumstances.
56 Existing law provides that if a child who is alleged to be delinquent is taken
57 into custody and detained, the child must be given a detention hearing before the
58 juvenile court. (NRS 62C.040) Section 15 of this bill requires the juvenile court to
59 order a qualified professional to evaluate the mental health of a child who: (1) is
60 alleged to have committed certain unlawful acts involving a battery against a school
61 employee or a child welfare professional; and (2) has, in the previous year, been
62 taken into custody two or more times for certain battery offenses. Section 16 of this
63 bill makes a conforming change related to the detention of such children under
64 section 15.
65 Existing law requires a juvenile court to suspend the driver’s license of a
66 juvenile under certain circumstances if a child is adjudicated to be in need of
67 supervision because the child: (1) is a habitual truant; (2) committed certain
68 unlawful acts related to tobacco; (3) committed certain unlawful acts related to a
69 controlled substance or alcohol; or (4) placed graffiti on or defaced property. (NRS
70 62E.430, 62E.440, 62E.630, 62E.690) Sections 17-20 of this bill make various
71 changes to authorize the juvenile court to order the Department of Motor Vehicles
72 to issue a restricted driver’s license to the child if the issuance is in the best interest
73 of the child. Section 51 of this bill makes a conforming change regarding the
74 circumstances under which the Department of Motor Vehicles may issue a
75 restricted driver’s license.
76 Existing law requires a court to discharge a defendant and dismiss the
77 proceedings or set aside the judgment of conviction upon completion of the terms
78 and conditions related to a program of treatment for alcohol or other substance use
79 disorder, a program for treatment of mental illness or a program of treatment for
80 veterans and members of the military or certain other terms and conditions.
81 Thereafter, existing law requires the sealing of records related to the discharge,
82 dismissal or setting aside a judgment of conviction. (NRS 176.211, 176A.240,
83 176A.245, 176A.260, 176A.265, 176A.290, 176A.295) Sections 21-24 of this bill
84 provide that the automatic record sealing provisions do not apply to such persons
85 who were charged with certain offenses related to the abuse or neglect of a child or
86 the abuse of an older or vulnerable person.
87 Existing law requires a court to release any bail at the time of sentencing, if the
88 court has not already done so, unless the defendant owes fines and costs, in which
89 case, the bail must be applied towards the fines and costs. (NRS 178.522, 178.528)
90 Section 29 of this bill provides that under these circumstances if the bail has been
91 deposited by a person other than a surety, and upon notice and the agreement of the
92 person, the bail must first be applied towards the payment of any restitution owed
93 by the defendant. Section 28 of this bill makes a conforming change related to the
94 procedures prescribed by section 29.
95 Existing law authorizes: (1) a district attorney and any attorney employed by a
96 district attorney to prosecute a person in a county other than the county by which
97 the district attorney is employed for the limited purpose of conducting a pretrial
98 release hearing; and (2) such an attorney to receive a stipend for being available on
99 a weekend or holiday to serve as a prosecuting attorney in a pretrial release hearing.
100 (NRS 178.760) Section 30 of this bill similarly authorizes a city attorney in a
101 county whose population is less than 100,000 (currently all counties except Clark
102 and Washoe Counties) to be deputized to prosecute a person in the county that
103 encompasses the city that employs the city attorney for the limited purpose of
104 serving as a prosecuting attorney in a pretrial release hearing, and authorizes the
105 city attorney to receive the stipend for such services.
106 Existing law authorizes the establishment of correctional programs and judicial
107 programs for the reentry of offenders and parolees into the community. (NRS
108 209.4871-209.4889) Section 33 of this bill: (1) authorizes the Director of the
-

109 Department of Corrections to establish an alternative correctional program; and (2)
110 provides for the qualification and assignment offenders to the alternative
111 correctional program. Section 33.5 of this bill requires the Director to submit an
112 annual report to the Interim Finance Committee relating to the alternative
113 correctional program. Section 42 of this bill authorizes an offender participating in
114 an alternative correctional program to waive his or her eligibility for, and release
115 on, parole. Section 43 of this bill establishes provisions related to the effect of such
116 a waiver. Section 44 of this bill requires the State Board of Parole Commissioners
117 to consider the removal of an offender from an alternative correctional program in

119 and 39-41 of this bill establish and revise various provisions concerning the
120 alternative correctional program.
121 Existing law authorizes the Director of the Department of Corrections and the
122 sheriff, chief of police or town marshal to establish programs for the treatment of
123 prisoners with a substance use disorder using medication-assisted treatment. (NRS
124 209.4247, 211.400) Sections 34 and 37 of this bill require persons who establish
125 such programs to collaborate with the Department of Human Services if the
126 program relates to opioid use disorder.
127 Existing law: (1) authorizes a board of county commissioners, with certain
128 exceptions, to exercise all powers necessary or proper to address matters of local
129 concern for the effective operation of a county government, whether or not the
130 powers are expressly granted to the board; and (2) defines “matter of local concern”
131 for such purposes. (NRS 244.143, 244.146) Existing law also authorizes a board of
132 county commissioners to enact and enforce local police and sanitary ordinances and
133 regulations that are not in conflict with the general laws and regulations of this
134 State. (NRS 244.357) Section 46 of this bill requires a board of county
135 commissioners in a county whose population is 700,000 or more (currently only
136 Clark County) to adopt an ordinance that designates the geographic boundaries of
137 one or more corridors in which the commission of crime poses a significant risk to
138 public safety and the economic welfare of this State due to the high concentration
139 of tourists, visitors, employees and other persons in such corridors. Section 46
140 provides that a person who is charged with, convicted of or the subject of deferred
141 adjudication for any offense punishable as a misdemeanor: (1) for the first offense
142 within the corridor within 2 years, may as a condition of release, sentencing,
143 suspension of sentence or deferred adjudication, as applicable, be prohibited from
144 entering the corridor in which the offense occurred for a period not to exceed 1
145 year; and (2) for a second or subsequent offense within the corridor within 2 years,
146 must as a condition of release, sentencing, suspension of sentence or deferred

149 Section 9 of this bill authorizes a justice court, in a county wherein the board of
150 county commissioners adopts an ordinance designating the geographic boundaries
151 of one or more corridors pursuant to section 46, to establish an appropriate program
152 for the adjudication of offenses punishable as a misdemeanor that occurred within
153 the boundaries of such corridors.
154 Section 10 of this bill requires a justice court whose jurisdiction includes a

176 support services.
177 Existing law sets forth various penalties involving driving or operating a
178 vehicle or vessel under the influence of alcohol, a controlled substance or a
179 prohibited substance under certain circumstances. (Chapter 484C of NRS, NRS
180 488.400-488.520) Sections 52 and 54 of this bill provide that the prohibition on a
181 person driving or operating a vehicle or vessel with a specific amount of marijuana
182 or marijuana metabolite in his or her blood applies to certain offenses punishable as
183 a felony. Sections 53 and 55 of this bill increase the terms of imprisonment for a
184 person who proximately causes the death of another person while driving or
185 operating a vehicle or vessel under the influence of alcohol or a controlled
186 substance. Additionally, sections 53 and 55 further provide that any such person
187 who proximately causes the death of another person and who has previously been
188 once or twice convicted of certain offenses relating to driving or operating a vehicle
189 or vessel under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance is subject to an
190 increased penalty.
191 During the 2021 Legislative Session, the Legislature made an appropriation to
192 the Department of Corrections for the reintegration of the Offender Sentence
193 Management System into the Nevada Offender Tracking Information System. Any
194 remaining balance of that appropriation was required to be reverted to the State
195 General Fund on or before September 15, 2023. (Section 2 of chapter 463, Statutes
196 of Nevada 2021, at page 2875) During the 2023 and 2025 Legislative Sessions, the
197 Legislature extended the reversion date to September 19, 2025, and September 17,
198 2027, respectively. Section 58.1 of this bill extends the reversion date to
199 September 21, 2029.
200 Existing law authorizes an offender to earn certain credits to reduce the
201 sentence of imprisonment of the offender. (NRS 209.432-209.449) During the 2023
202 Legislative Session, the Legislature established a revised method for awarding
203 credits to reduce the sentence of an offender that applied to an offender sentenced
204 to a crime committed: (1) on or after July 1, 2025; or (2) before July 1, 2025, if the

16 driving or exercising actual physical control of a vehicle,
17  to drive or be in actual physical control of a vehicle on a highway
18 or on premises to which the public has access. The fact that any
19 person charged with a violation of this subsection is or has been
20 entitled to use that drug under the laws of this State is not a defense
21 against any charge of violating this subsection.
22 3. It is unlawful for any person to drive or be in actual physical
23 control of a vehicle on a highway or on premises to which the public
24 has access with an amount of any of the following prohibited
