Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides that if a person commits an assault upon an officer who is
2 performing his or her duty and the person knew or should have known that the victim was an
3 officer, the person is guilty of: (1) a category B felony if the assault is made with the use of a
4 deadly weapon or the present ability to use a deadly weapon; (2) a category D felony if the

Assembly Amendment No. 13 to Assembly Bill No. 4 Page 4
5 person is a probationer, prisoner or parolee; or (3) if neither of those circumstances is present,
6 a gross misdemeanor. (NRS 200.471) Additionally, existing law provides that if a person
7 commits a battery upon an officer and the person knew or should have known that the victim
8 was an officer, the person is guilty of: (1) a category B felony if the battery causes substantial
9 bodily harm or is committed by strangulation; or (2) if those circumstances are not present and
10 no greater penalty is provided by law, a gross misdemeanor. (NRS 200.481) Sections 1 and 2
11 of this bill revise the definition of “officer” for the purposes of the enhanced penalties for
12 assault or battery to include an employee of this State or a political subdivision of this State
13 whose normal job responsibilities require the employee to: (1) interact with the public; and (2)
14 perform tasks related to child welfare services or child protective services or tasks that expose
15 the person to comparable danger. Additionally, sections 1 and 2 apply the enhanced penalties
16 to an assault or battery committed against a hospitality employee.
17 Existing law prohibits a person from stalking and prescribes various penalties related to
18 the circumstance under which the offense is committed. (NRS 200.575) Section 3 of this bill
19 expands the unlawful acts which constitute stalking to include certain courses of conduct that
20 would cause the victim to feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated, harassed or fearful for the
21 immediate safety of a person in a dating relationship with the victim. Section 3 also makes
22 various changes to provide that stalking encompasses both acts committed in person and by
23 electronic means, and provides that such penalties are generally applicable to such acts
24 regardless of medium. Sections 25 and 45 of this bill make conforming changes related to the
25 commission of stalking by electronic means under section 3.
26 Existing law provides that it is unlawful for a person to knowingly and willfully have in
27 his or her possession: (1) any film, photograph or other visual representation depicting a
28 person under the age of 16 years as the subject of a sexual portrayal or engaging in or
29 simulating, or assisting others to engage in or simulate, sexual conduct; or (2) computer-
30 generated child sexual abuse material. (NRS 200.730) Section 4 of this bill revises the unit of
31 prosecution for such an offense and prescribes that each person depicted under the age of 16
32 years in any film, photograph or other visual presentation and each child depicted or
33 represented in any computer-generated child sexual abuse material, respectively, constitutes a
34 separate offense.
35 [Existing law: (1) prescribes various circumstances in which a person is prohibited from
36 owning, possessing or having under his or her custody or control a firearm; and (2) establishes
37 procedures related to the surrender, sale or transfer of a firearm by certain persons who are
38 prohibited from owning, possessing or having under their custody or control a firearm. (NRS
39 33.031, 33.033, 202.360, 202.361) Sections 5, 11 and 26 of this bill generally require a court
40 to schedule a compliance hearing under such circumstances to determine whether a person has
41 complied with a court order to surrender, sell or transfer a firearm. Sections 5, 11 and 26,
42 however, authorize the court to cancel the compliance hearing under certain circumstances.
43 Sections 6, 12 and 27 of this bill apply certain related definitions in existing law to sections 5,
44 11 and 26, respectively.]
45 Existing law establishes certain crimes making it unlawful to take or obtain property.
46 (NRS 205.0821-205.295) Section 7 of this bill creates a new crime which provides that if a
47 person intentionally causes property damage to a retail establishment in the commission of a
48 theft offense and the aggregate value of the amount involved in the theft or property damage,
49 or any combination thereof, is $750 or more, the person is guilty of a category C felony.
50 Existing law: (1) prescribes various circumstances in which a person is prohibited
51 from owning, possessing or having under his or her custody or control a firearm; and (2)
52 establishes procedures related to the surrender, sale or transfer of a firearm by certain
53 persons who are prohibited from owning, possessing or having under their custody or
54 control a firearm. (NRS 33.031, 33.033) Sections 11 and 26 of this bill generally require a
55 court to schedule a compliance hearing under such circumstances to determine whether
56 a person has complied with a court order to surrender, sell or transfer a firearm.
57 Sections 11 and 26, however, authorize the court to cancel the compliance hearing under
58 certain circumstances. Sections 12 and 27 of this bill apply certain related definitions in
59 existing law to sections 11 and 26, respectively.
60 Existing law sets forth certain unlawful acts that constitute domestic violence when
61 committed against certain persons. (NRS 33.018) Section 13 of this bill revises the unlawful
62 acts that constitute domestic violence to include kidnapping as well as an attempt or
63 solicitation to commit any unlawful act that constitutes domestic violence.

Assembly Amendment No. 13 to Assembly Bill No. 4 Page 5
64 Existing law establishes provisions concerning actions for wrongful conviction. (NRS
65 41.900-41.970) Section 14 of this bill provides that the entry of a certificate of innocence and
66 the award in an action for wrongful conviction is not a finding that: (1) certain persons
67 committed a wrongdoing; or (2) there was not probable cause under certain circumstances.
68 Existing law provides that if a child who is alleged to be delinquent is taken into custody
69 and detained, the child must be given a detention hearing before the juvenile court. (NRS
70 62C.040) Section 15 of this bill requires the juvenile court to order a qualified professional to
71 evaluate the mental health of a child who: (1) is alleged to have committed certain unlawful
72 acts involving a battery against a school employee or a child welfare professional; and (2) has,
73 in the previous year, been taken into custody two or more times for certain battery offenses.
74 Section 16 of this bill makes a conforming change related to the detention of such children
75 under section 15.
76 Existing law requires a juvenile court to suspend the driver’s license of a juvenile under
77 certain circumstances if a child is adjudicated to be in need of supervision because the child:
78 (1) is a habitual truant; (2) committed certain unlawful acts related to tobacco; (3) committed
79 certain unlawful acts related to a controlled substance or alcohol; or (4) placed graffiti on or
80 defaced property. (NRS 62E.430, 62E.440, 62E.630, 62E.690) Sections 17-20 of this bill
81 make various changes to authorize the juvenile court to order the Department of Motor
82 Vehicles to issue a restricted driver’s license to the child if the issuance is in the best interest
83 of the child. Section 51 of this bill makes a conforming change regarding the circumstances
84 under which the Department of Motor Vehicles may issue a restricted driver’s license.
85 Existing law requires a court to discharge a defendant and dismiss the proceedings or set
86 aside the judgment of conviction upon completion of the terms and conditions related to a
87 program of treatment for alcohol or other substance use disorder, a program for treatment of
88 mental illness or a program of treatment for veterans and members of the military or certain
89 other terms and conditions. Thereafter, existing law requires the sealing of records related to
90 the discharge, dismissal or setting aside a judgment of conviction. (NRS 176.211, 176A.240,
91 176A.245, 176A.260, 176A.265, 176A.290, 176A.295) Sections 21-24 of this bill provide
92 that the automatic record sealing provisions do not apply to such persons who were charged
93 with certain offenses related to the abuse or neglect of a child or the abuse of an older or
94 vulnerable person.
95 Existing law requires a court to release any bail at the time of sentencing, if the court has
96 not already done so, unless the defendant owes fines and costs, in which case, the bail must be
97 applied towards the fines and costs. (NRS 178.522, 178.528) Section 29 of this bill provides
98 that under these circumstances if the bail has been deposited by a person other than a surety,
99 and upon notice and the agreement of the person, the bail must first be applied towards the
100 payment of any restitution owed by the defendant. Section 28 of this bill makes a conforming
101 change related to the procedures prescribed by section 29.
102 Existing law authorizes: (1) a district attorney and any attorney employed by a district
103 attorney to prosecute a person in a county other than the county by which the district attorney
104 is employed for the limited purpose of conducting a pretrial release hearing; and (2) such an
105 attorney to receive a stipend for being available on a weekend or holiday to serve as a
106 prosecuting attorney in a pretrial release hearing. (NRS 178.760) Section 30 of this bill
107 similarly authorizes a city attorney in a county whose population is less than 100,000
108 (currently all counties except Clark and Washoe Counties) to be deputized to prosecute a
109 person in the county that encompasses the city that employs the city attorney for the limited
110 purpose of serving as a prosecuting attorney in a pretrial release hearing, and authorizes the
111 city attorney to receive the stipend for such services.
112 Existing law authorizes the establishment of correctional programs and judicial programs
113 for the reentry of offenders and parolees into the community. (NRS 209.4871-209.4889)
114 Section 33 of this bill: (1) authorizes the Director of the Department of Corrections to
115 establish an alternative correctional program; and (2) provides for the qualification and
116 assignment offenders to the alternative correctional program. Section 33.5 of this bill
117 requires the Director to submit an annual report to the Interim Finance Committee
118 relating to the alternative correctional program. Section 42 of this bill authorizes an
119 offender participating in an alternative correctional program to waive his or her eligibility for,
120 and release on, parole. Section 43 of this bill establishes provisions related to the effect of
121 such a waiver. Section 44 of this bill requires the State Board of Parole Commissioners to
122 consider the removal of an offender from an alternative correctional program in its

Assembly Amendment No. 13 to Assembly Bill No. 4 Page 6
123 determination of whether to release an offender on parole. Sections 32, 35, 36 and 39-41 of
124 this bill establish and revise various provisions concerning the alternative correctional
125 program.
126 Existing law authorizes the Director of the Department of Corrections and the sheriff,
127 chief of police or town marshal to establish programs for the treatment of prisoners with a
128 substance use disorder using medication-assisted treatment. (NRS 209.4247, 211.400)
129 Sections 34 and 37 of this bill require persons who establish such programs to collaborate
130 with the Department of Human Services if the program relates to opioid use disorder.
131 Existing law provides that before a prisoner who is in the custody of a county or city
132 jail or detention facility is questioned about his or her immigration status, the prisoner
133 must be informed about the purpose of such questions. (NRS 211.007) Section 36.5 of
134 this bill establishes procedures relating to the automatic notification of consular posts if
135 a county or city jail or detention facility in a county whose population is 700,000 or more
136 (currently only Clark County) believes that a prisoner is not a United States citizen.
137 Section 36.5 additionally requires the Peace Officers’ Standards and Training
138 Commission to develop certain training materials relating to the automatic notification
139 requirements, the rights of foreign nationals under international law and procedures for
140 identifying foreign nationals during the intake process.
141 Existing law: (1) authorizes a board of county commissioners, with certain exceptions, to
142 exercise all powers necessary or proper to address matters of local concern for the effective
143 operation of a county government, whether or not the powers are expressly granted to the
144 board; and (2) defines “matter of local concern” for such purposes. (NRS 244.143, 244.146)
145 Existing law also authorizes a board of county commissioners to enact and enforce local
146 police and sanitary ordinances and regulations that are not in conflict with the general laws
147 and regulations of this State. (NRS 244.357) Section 46 of this bill requires a board of county
148 commissioners in a county whose population is 700,000 or more (currently only Clark
149 County) to adopt an ordinance that designates the geographic boundaries of one or more
150 corridors in which the commission of crime poses a significant risk to public safety and the
151 economic welfare of this State due to the high concentration of tourists, visitors, employees
152 and other persons in such corridors. Section 46 provides that a person who is charged with,
153 convicted of or the subject of deferred adjudication for any offense punishable as a
154 misdemeanor: (1) for the first offense within the corridor within 2 years, may as a condition of
155 release, sentencing, suspension of sentence or deferred adjudication, as applicable, be
156 prohibited from entering the corridor in which the offense occurred for a period not to exceed
157 1 year; and (2) for a second or subsequent offense within the corridor within 2 years, must as a
158 condition of release, sentencing, suspension of sentence or deferred adjudication, as
159 applicable, be prohibited from entering the corridor in which the offense occurred for a period
160 of not less than 1 year.
161 Section 9 of this bill authorizes a justice court, in a county wherein the board of county
162 commissioners adopts an ordinance designating the geographic boundaries of one or more
163 corridors pursuant to section 46, to establish an appropriate program for the adjudication of
164 offenses punishable as a misdemeanor that occurred within the boundaries of such corridors.
165 Section 10 of this bill requires a justice court whose jurisdiction includes a corridor
166 established pursuant to section 46 to prepare and submit: (1) to the Legislature an annual
167 report containing certain information regarding crimes that occur within such corridors; and
168 (2) to the respective board of county commissioners a monthly report containing certain
169 information regarding crimes that occur within such corridors.
170 Existing law requires the Department of Human Services: (1) to conduct a statewide
171 needs assessment to determine the priorities for allocating money from the Fund for a
172 Resilient Nevada; and (2) based on that needs assessment, to develop a statewide plan for
173 allocating the money in the Fund. (NRS 433.732, 433.734) Existing law also prescribes
174 specific requirements concerning the statewide needs assessment. (NRS 433.736) Section 50
175 of this bill requires the statewide needs assessment to identify educational resources to be used
176 for the training of law enforcement and other criminal justice agencies related to trauma-
177 informed practices and medication-assisted treatment for persons with opioid use disorder.

181 433.622-433.641) Section 47 of this bill requires the Department of Human Services to make

Assembly Amendment No. 13 to Assembly Bill No. 4 Page 7
182 available certain information relating to peer recovery support services. Sections 48 and 56-
183 58 of this bill make conforming changes governing the applicability of section 47 to certain
184 existing provisions of law related to peer support services.
185 Existing law sets forth various penalties involving driving or operating a vehicle or vessel
186 under the influence of alcohol, a controlled substance or a prohibited substance under certain
187 circumstances. (Chapter 484C of NRS, NRS 488.400-488.520) Sections 52 and 54 of this bill
188 provide that the prohibition on a person driving or operating a vehicle or vessel with a specific
189 amount of marijuana or marijuana metabolite in his or her blood applies to certain offenses
190 punishable as a felony. Sections 53 and 55 of this bill increase the terms of imprisonment for
191 a person who proximately causes the death of another person while driving or operating a
192 vehicle or vessel under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance. Additionally,
193 sections 53 and 55 further provide that any such person who proximately causes the death of
194 another person and who has previously been once or twice convicted of certain offenses
195 relating to driving or operating a vehicle or vessel under the influence of alcohol or a
196 controlled substance is subject to an increased penalty.
197 During the 2021 Legislative Session, the Legislature made an appropriation to the
198 Department of Corrections for the reintegration of the Offender Sentence Management
199 System into the Nevada Offender Tracking Information System. Any remaining balance
200 of that appropriation was required to be reverted to the State General Fund on or before
201 September 15, 2023. (Section 2 of chapter 463, Statutes of Nevada 2021, at page 2875)
202 During the 2023 and 2025 Legislative Sessions, the Legislature extended the reversion
203 date to September 19, 2025, and September 17, 2027, respectively. Section 58.1 of this
204 bill extends the reversion date to September 21, 2029.
205 Existing law authorizes an offender to earn certain credits to reduce the sentence of
206 imprisonment of the offender. (NRS 209.432-209.449) During the 2023 Legislative
207 Session, the Legislature established a revised method for awarding credits to reduce the
208 sentence of an offender that applied to an offender sentenced to a crime committed: (1)
209 on or after July 1, 2025; or (2) before July 1, 2025, if the offender elected to be subject to
210 the revised method. (NRS 209.4467) During the 2025 Legislative Session, the Legislature
211 delayed the implementation of the revised method to July 1, 2026. Sections 58.2-58.7 of
212 this bill further delay the implementation of the revised method to July 1, 2027.
213 Additionally, section 58.2 requires the Director of the Department of Corrections to
214 calculate the credit of certain offenders who are within 2 years of completion of their
215 minimum term or minimum aggregate term or maximum term or maximum aggregate
216 term, as applicable, of imprisonment on or after July 1, 2027, using the revised method,
217 and authorizes such offenders and the Director to make certain decisions affecting
218 parole eligibility and release.
219 [Sections] Section 59 [and 60 make appropriations] of this bill makes an appropriation
