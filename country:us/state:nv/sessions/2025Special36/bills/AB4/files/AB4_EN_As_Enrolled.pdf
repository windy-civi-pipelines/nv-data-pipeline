Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law provides that if a person commits an assault upon an officer who
is performing his or her duty and the person knew or should have known that the
victim was an officer, the person is guilty of: (1) a category B felony if the assault
is made with the use of a deadly weapon or the present ability to use a deadly
weapon; (2) a category D felony if the person is a probationer, prisoner or parolee;
or (3) if neither of those circumstances is present, a gross misdemeanor. (NRS
200.471) Additionally, existing law provides that if a person commits a battery
upon an officer and the person knew or should have known that the victim was an
officer, the person is guilty of: (1) a category B felony if the battery causes
substantial bodily harm or is committed by strangulation; or (2) if those
circumstances are not present and no greater penalty is provided by law, a gross
misdemeanor. (NRS 200.481) Sections 1 and 2 of this bill revise the definition of
“officer” for the purposes of the enhanced penalties for assault or battery to include
an employee of this State or a political subdivision of this State whose normal job
responsibilities require the employee to: (1) interact with the public; and (2)

Section 3 of this bill expands the unlawful acts which constitute stalking to include
certain courses of conduct that would cause the victim to feel terrorized, frightened,
intimidated, harassed or fearful for the immediate safety of a person in a dating
relationship with the victim. Section 3 also makes various changes to provide that

commission of stalking by electronic means under section 3.
Existing law provides that it is unlawful for a person to knowingly and willfully
have in his or her possession: (1) any film, photograph or other visual
representation depicting a person under the age of 16 years as the subject of a
sexual portrayal or engaging in or simulating, or assisting others to engage in or
simulate, sexual conduct; or (2) computer-generated child sexual abuse material.
(NRS 200.730) Section 4 of this bill revises the unit of prosecution for such an
offense and prescribes that each person depicted under the age of 16 years in any
film, photograph or other visual presentation and each child depicted or represented
in any computer-generated child sexual abuse material, respectively, constitutes a
separate offense.
Existing law establishes certain crimes making it unlawful to take or obtain

amount involved in the theft or property damage, or any combination thereof, is
$750 or more, the person is guilty of a category C felony.
Existing law sets forth certain unlawful acts that constitute domestic violence
when committed against certain persons. (NRS 33.018) Section 13 of this bill

Existing law establishes provisions concerning actions for wrongful conviction.
(NRS 41.900-41.970) Section 14 of this bill provides that the entry of a certificate

Existing law provides that if a child who is alleged to be delinquent is taken
into custody and detained, the child must be given a detention hearing before the
juvenile court. (NRS 62C.040) Section 15 of this bill requires the juvenile court to

alleged to have committed certain unlawful acts involving a battery against a school
employee or a child welfare professional; and (2) has, in the previous year, been

bill makes a conforming change related to the detention of such children under
section 15.
Existing law requires a juvenile court to suspend the driver’s license of a
juvenile under certain circumstances if a child is adjudicated to be in need of
supervision because the child: (1) is a habitual truant; (2) committed certain
unlawful acts related to tobacco; (3) committed certain unlawful acts related to a
controlled substance or alcohol; or (4) placed graffiti on or defaced property. (NRS

Thereafter, existing law requires the sealing of records related to the discharge,
dismissal or setting aside a judgment of conviction. (NRS 176.211, 176A.240,
176A.245, 176A.260, 176A.265, 176A.290, 176A.295) Sections 21-24 of this bill

who were charged with certain offenses related to the abuse or neglect of a child or
the abuse of an older or vulnerable person.
Existing law requires a court to release any bail at the time of sentencing, if the

case, the bail must be applied towards the fines and costs. (NRS 178.522, 178.528)
Section 29 of this bill provides that under these circumstances if the bail has been

procedures prescribed by section 29.
Existing law authorizes: (1) a district attorney and any attorney employed by a

the district attorney is employed for the limited purpose of conducting a pretrial

(NRS 178.760) Section 30 of this bill similarly authorizes a city attorney in a

in custody under process of law or under lawful arrest to create and maintain a list

and 39-41 of this bill establish and revise various provisions concerning the
alternative correctional program.
Existing law authorizes the Director of the Department of Corrections and the
sheriff, chief of police or town marshal to establish programs for the treatment of
prisoners with a substance use disorder using medication-assisted treatment. (NRS

program relates to opioid use disorder.
Existing law: (1) authorizes a board of county commissioners, with certain
exceptions, to exercise all powers necessary or proper to address matters of local

county commissioners to enact and enforce local police and sanitary ordinances and
regulations that are not in conflict with the general laws and regulations of this
State. (NRS 244.357) Section 46 of this bill requires a board of county
commissioners in a county whose population is 700,000 or more (currently only
Clark County) to adopt an ordinance that designates the geographic boundaries of
one or more corridors in which the commission of crime poses a significant risk to
public safety and the economic welfare of this State due to the high concentration
of tourists, visitors, employees and other persons in such corridors. Section 46
provides that a person who is charged with, convicted of or the subject of deferred
adjudication for any offense punishable as a misdemeanor: (1) for the first offense
within the corridor within 2 years, may as a condition of release, sentencing,
suspension of sentence or deferred adjudication, as applicable, be prohibited from
entering the corridor in which the offense occurred for a period not to exceed 1
year; and (2) for a second or subsequent offense within the corridor within 2 years,
must as a condition of release, sentencing, suspension of sentence or deferred
adjudication, as applicable, be prohibited from entering the corridor in which the

Section 9 of this bill authorizes a justice court, in a county wherein the board of
county commissioners adopts an ordinance designating the geographic boundaries
of one or more corridors pursuant to section 46, to establish an appropriate program

district or public school from providing certain law enforcement officers: (1)
permission to access the grounds, buildings or facilities of a school district or

assessment. (NRS 433.736) Section 50 of this bill requires the statewide needs
assessment to identify educational resources to be used for the training of law

the applicability of section 47 to certain existing provisions of law related to peer

vehicle or vessel under the influence of alcohol, a controlled substance or a
prohibited substance under certain circumstances. (Chapter 484C of NRS, NRS
488.400-488.520) Sections 52 and 54 of this bill provide that the prohibition on a
person driving or operating a vehicle or vessel with a specific amount of marijuana
or marijuana metabolite in his or her blood applies to certain offenses punishable as
a felony. Sections 53 and 55 of this bill increase the terms of imprisonment for a
person who proximately causes the death of another person while driving or
operating a vehicle or vessel under the influence of alcohol or a controlled
substance. Additionally, sections 53 and 55 further provide that any such person
who proximately causes the death of another person and who has previously been
once or twice convicted of certain offenses relating to driving or operating a vehicle
or vessel under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance is subject to an
increased penalty.
During the 2021 Legislative Session, the Legislature made an appropriation to
the Department of Corrections for the reintegration of the Offender Sentence
Management System into the Nevada Offender Tracking Information System. Any
remaining balance of that appropriation was required to be reverted to the State
General Fund on or before September 15, 2023. (Section 2 of chapter 463, Statutes
of Nevada 2021, at page 2875) During the 2023 and 2025 Legislative Sessions, the
Legislature extended the reversion date to September 19, 2025, and September 17,
2027, respectively. Section 58.1 of this bill extends the reversion date to
September 21, 2029.
Existing law authorizes an offender to earn certain credits to reduce the
sentence of imprisonment of the offender. (NRS 209.432-209.449) During the 2023
Legislative Session, the Legislature established a revised method for awarding
credits to reduce the sentence of an offender that applied to an offender sentenced
to a crime committed: (1) on or after July 1, 2025; or (2) before July 1, 2025, if the
offender elected to be subject to the revised method. (NRS 209.4467) During the
2025 Legislative Session, the Legislature delayed the implementation of the revised
method to July 1, 2026. Sections 58.2-58.7 of this bill further delay the
implementation of the revised method to July 1, 2027. Additionally, section 58.2

certain offenders who are within 2 years of completion of their minimum term or
minimum aggregate term or maximum term or maximum aggregate term, as
