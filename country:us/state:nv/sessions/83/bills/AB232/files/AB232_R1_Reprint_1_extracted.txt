AN ACT relating to public employees; revising the computation of

relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes a method for calculating the credit for service received
2 by a public employee who is a member of the Public Employees’ Retirement
3 System. (NRS 286.470-286.505) Under existing law, certain employees of a school
4 district who are members of the System receive a full year of service credit if such
5 an employee works full-time for the full school year. (NRS 286.501) Section 2 of
6 this bill provides that such an employee of a school district receive a full year of
7 service credit if the employee works at least 900 hours over the course of not less
8 than 8 calendar months in a school year. Section 1 of this bill makes a conforming
9 change to allow for the computation of service credit in section 2.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 286.481 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 286.481 A member shall not be credited with service for:
-
*AB232_R1*
– 2 –
1 1. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 286.385, leave of
2 absence without pay;
3 2. Overtime work;
4 3. Employment in a position which does not qualify the
5 member for participation in the System;
6 4. [More] Except as otherwise provided in NRS 286.501, more
7 than 1 day within a day, 1 month within a month, or 1 year of
8 service in any 12-month period; or
9 5. Any period for which compensation is not received by the
10 member unless specifically otherwise provided in this chapter.
11 Sec. 2. NRS 286.501 is hereby amended to read as follows:
12 286.501 Each member who is employed by a school district for
13 less than 12 months per school year and each member of the
14 professional staff of the Nevada System of Higher Education
15 employed for the academic year who is employed for less than 12
16 months per fiscal year is credited with service as follows:
17 1. Service is credited on the basis of a full year if the member
18 works [full-time for the full] at least 900 hours over the course of
19 not less than 8 calendar months in a school year.
20 2. Employment for [a part of] less than 900 hours over the
21 course of not less than 8 calendar months in a school year is
22 credited on a ratio of one and one-third days for each day worked,
23 but credit may not be given in advance or until the appropriate
24 period has expired.
25 3. A full year of service is not credited until the full 12-month
26 period has expired. If the employee begins work under a new
27 contract before the expiration of the 12-month period for the old
28 contract, credit must be granted for the period of overlap, as
29 certified by the school district, at the first period in which there is a
30 lapse in service.
31 4. Service credit under this section must be computed
32 according to:
33 (a) The school year for school district employees.
34 (b) The fiscal year for members of the professional staff of the
35 Nevada System of Higher Education.
36 5. A member receives full credit while on sabbatical leave if
37 the public employer certifies that the compensation and
38 contributions reported for the member are the same as if the member
39 were employed full-time. If the employer does not so certify, the
40 member receives credit in the proportion that the member’s actual
41 compensation bears to the member’s previous compensation.
42  No member may receive less credit under this section than was
43 provided under the law in force when the credit was earned.

2 286.481 A member shall not be credited with service for:

11 Sec. 2. NRS 286.501 is hereby amended to read as follows:
12 286.501 Each member who is employed by a school district for
13 less than 12 months per school year and each member of the

41 compensation bears to the member’s previous compensation.
