Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law establishes a method for calculating the credit for service received
by a public employee who is a member of the Public Employees’ Retirement
System. (NRS 286.470-286.505) Under existing law, certain employees of a school
district who are members of the System receive a full year of service credit if such
an employee works full-time for the full school year. (NRS 286.501) Section 2 of
this bill provides that such an employee of a school district receive a full year of
service credit if the employee works at least 900 hours over the course of not less
than 8 calendar months in a school year. Section 1 of this bill makes a conforming
change to allow for the computation of service credit in section 2.
