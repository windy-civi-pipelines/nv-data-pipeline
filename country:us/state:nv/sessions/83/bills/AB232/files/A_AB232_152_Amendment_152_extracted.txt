System who are employed by a school district; and providing other

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes a method for calculating the credit for service received by a
2 public employee who is a member of the Public Employees’ Retirement System. (NRS
3 286.470-286.505) Under existing law, certain employees of a school district who are members
4 of the System receive a full year of service credit if such an employee works full-time for the
5 full school year. (NRS 286.501) Section 2 of this bill provides that such an employee of a
6 school district receive a full year of service credit if the employee works at least 900 hours
7 over the course of not less than 8 calendar months in a school year. Section 1 of this bill
8 makes a conforming change to allow for the computation of service credit in section 2.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN

4 pay;
5 2. Overtime work;
6 3. Employment in a position which does not qualify the member for

Assembly Amendment No. 152 to Assembly Bill No. 232 Page 4
1 4. [More] Except as otherwise provided in NRS 286.501, more than 1 day
2 within a day, 1 month within a month, or 1 year of service in any 12-month period;
3 or
4 5. Any period for which compensation is not received by the member unless
5 specifically otherwise provided in this chapter.
6 Sec. 2. NRS 286.501 is hereby amended to read as follows:
7 286.501 Each member who is employed by a school district for less than 12
8 months per school year and each member of the professional staff of the Nevada
9 System of Higher Education employed for the academic year who is employed for
10 less than 12 months per fiscal year is credited with service as follows:
11 1. Service is credited on the basis of a full year if the member works [full-
12 time for the full] at least 900 hours over the course of not less than 8 calendar
13 months in a school year.
14 2. Employment for [a part of] less than 900 hours over the course of not less
15 than 8 calendar months in a school year is credited on a ratio of one and one-third
16 days for each day worked, but credit may not be given in advance or until the
17 appropriate period has expired.
18 3. A full year of service is not credited until the full 12-month period has
19 expired. If the employee begins work under a new contract before the expiration of
20 the 12-month period for the old contract, credit must be granted for the period of
21 overlap, as certified by the school district, at the first period in which there is a
22 lapse in service.
23 4. Service credit under this section must be computed according to:
24 (a) The school year for school district employees.
25 (b) The fiscal year for members of the professional staff of the Nevada System
26 of Higher Education.
27 5. A member receives full credit while on sabbatical leave if the public
28 employer certifies that the compensation and contributions reported for the member
29 are the same as if the member were employed full-time. If the employer does not so
30 certify, the member receives credit in the proportion that the member’s actual
31 compensation bears to the member’s previous compensation.
32  No member may receive less credit under this section than was provided under
33 the law in force when the credit was earned.
34 Sec. 3. This act becomes effective on July 1, 2025.
