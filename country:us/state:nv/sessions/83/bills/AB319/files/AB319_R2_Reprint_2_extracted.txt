Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of physicians, physician
2 assistants, anesthesiologist assistants, practitioners of respiratory care and
3 perfusionists by the Board of Medical Examiners. (Chapter 630 of NRS) Sections
4 11 and 14 of this bill revise provisions governing examinations that are necessary
5 for licensure as a physician. Section 14 also increases the amount of the fine that
6 the Board may impose on an applicant for a license as a physician who submits
7 false information in connection with the application.
8 Section 21 of this bill requires each licensee of the Board to maintain a
9 permanent electronic mail address for communication with the Board.
10 Existing law prescribes separate qualifications for licensure for: (1) persons
11 who received their medical education in the United States or Canada; and (2)
12 persons who received their medical education in other foreign countries. (NRS
13 630.160, 630.170, 630.195, 630.263, 630.264, 630.265) Existing law also requires a
14 physician to have completed certain residencies in ophthalmology in the United
15 States or Canada in order to perform laser surgery or intense pulsed light therapy on
16 the globe of the eye. (NRS 630.371) Sections 4, 5, 8, 14, 19, 26-28 and 64 of this
17 bill make various changes so that persons who received their medical education in
18 the United Kingdom, Australia or New Zealand, and other foreign countries whose
19 standards for medical education are determined to be equivalent by the Board, are
20 treated identically to persons who received their medical education in the United
21 States or Canada for those purposes.
22 Existing law requires: (1) an applicant for a license to practice medicine to hold
23 certain certifications or have completed or be enrolled in certain progressive
24 postgraduate education; and (2) a physician who performs certain procedures on the
25 eye to have completed certain progressive postgraduate education in
26 ophthalmology. (NRS 630.160, 630.371) Section 6 of this bill prescribes the
27 manner in which the Board must determine whether postgraduate education is
28 progressive for those purposes. Section 14 revises the amount of progressive
29 postgraduate education that a resident physician must have completed in order to be
30 eligible for a license.
31 Existing law authorizes a practitioner of respiratory care to perform certain
32 laboratory tests without obtaining certification as an assistant in a medical
33 laboratory. (NRS 652.210) Sections 9 and 82 of this bill authorize a practitioner of
34 respiratory care to perform certain moderate complexity tests without obtaining
35 such certification if: (1) the practitioner of respiratory care has been trained to
36 perform the test; and (2) the test is within the scope of practice of a practitioner of
37 respiratory care.
38 Sections 15, 16 and 84 of this bill revise and simplify provisions governing
39 licensure by endorsement as a physician by: (1) eliminating expedited licensure by
40 endorsement, except for certain persons affiliated with the Armed Forces of the
41 United States; and (2) making certain revisions relating to the qualifications for
42 licensure by endorsement. Sections 17, 18, 20, 23 and 30 of this bill eliminate
43 references to a section repealed by section 84.
44 Existing law authorizes the Board to require a licensee who has not practiced in
45 more than 24 consecutive months to take the same examination to test competency
46 as that given to applicants for a license. (NRS 630.257) Section 22 of this bill
47 revises this provision to apply to inactive licensees and applicants for a license who
48 have not actively practiced in more than 24 consecutive months. Section 22 also
49 authorizes the Board to require such a person to demonstrate his or her competency
50 in a manner other than by taking an examination. Sections 16, 28, 36, 40 and 41 of
51 this bill make conforming changes to add references to those requirements where
52 appropriate.
53 Existing law provides for the issuance of various special licenses to practice
54 medicine. (NRS 630.258-630.266) Section 23 removes the requirement that the
-
*AB319_R2*
– 3 –
55 Board automatically issue a special volunteer license, which authorizes certain
56 retired physicians to continue practicing on a volunteer basis, to a person who
57 possesses the required qualifications for such a license. Section 24 of this bill
58 eliminates the specific statutory requirements for licensure from which a person
59 applying for licensure as an administrative physician is exempt and instead requires
60 the Board to adopt regulations prescribing the requirements from which such an
61 applicant is exempt. Sections 25 and 30 of this bill eliminate a special license that
62 allows a licensed physician of another state to come into this State to care for a
63 specific patient in association with a physician licensed in this State. Section 25
64 also eliminates a restricted license for a specified period if the Board determines the
65 applicant needs supervision or restriction. Sections 1, 25 and 30 of this bill revise
66 the name of a special purpose license, which allows an out-of-state physician to
67 provide certain medical services to patients in this State electronically,
68 telephonically or by fiber optics, to instead be called a telemedicine license.
69 Existing law establishes fees for the issuance and renewal of a license as a
70 physician assistant or anesthesiologist assistant who is simultaneously licensed by
71 the Board of Medical Examiners and the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine that
72 are one-half of the amount of the standard fees for the issuance and renewal of such
73 a license, meaning that such a person is required to pay one-half of the standard
74 licensure fees to each of those boards. (NRS 630.268, 633.501) If a person who
75 pays such a reduced fee to one of those boards fails to also pay the required fee to
76 the other board within 12 months, sections 29, 31-33, 38, 42 and 76-81 of this bill
77 require the person to pay to the board to whom the person has paid a fee the
78 difference between the reduced fee and the standard fee. Sections 12, 13 and 73-75
79 of this bill require the Board of Medical Examiners and the State Board of
80 Osteopathic Medicine to share information as necessary to enforce that
81 requirement. Section 30 eliminates certain fees charged by the Board of Medical
82 Examiners.
83 Section 10 of this bill exempts certain students who engage in the supervised
84 practice of perfusion from the requirement to be licensed by the Board of Medical
85 Examiners. Sections 34-37 and 84 of this bill remove a requirement that an
86 applicant for a license as a perfusionist pass an examination given by the American
87 Board of Cardiovascular Perfusion, or its successor organization, and instead
88 require such an applicant to be certified by that organization. Section 39 of this bill
89 eliminates a provision prohibiting the Board from requiring a physician assistant to
90 be certified by a nationally recognized organization for the accreditation of
91 physician assistants to satisfy applicable continuing education requirements.
92 Sections 40 and 41 revise the conditions under which the Board may deny an
93 application for licensure by endorsement as a physician assistant. Section 43 of this
94 bill eliminates certain educational qualifications for licensure as a practitioner of
95 respiratory care.
96 Sections 44 and 45 of this bill clarify certain grounds for discipline against a
97 licensee of the Board. Section 45 also authorizes the Board to discipline a licensee
98 who fails to cooperate with an investigation of the Board. Sections 46-49, 52 and
99 62 of this bill revise certain provisions regarding the provision to the Board of
100 information relating to certain licensees, the examination to determine the fitness of
101 certain licensees and the removal of limitations or suspensions of licenses to be
102 applicable to all licensees of the Board. Section 46 provides that certain reports
103 filed by an insurer relating to malpractice actions are public records. Section 51 of
104 this bill provides that the Board is not required to review a complaint that is not
105 within the jurisdiction of the Board.
106 Existing law refers to the document that the Board files to initiate a formal
107 disciplinary proceeding as a formal complaint. (NRS 630.311) However, existing
108 law regarding the procedure of licensing boards generally refers to such a document
109 as a charging document. (NRS 622A.300) Sections 3, 50, 51, 54, 56, 57 and 59 of
-
*AB319_R2*
– 4 –
110 this bill standardize terminology so that such a document is referred to as a
111 charging document. Section 50 also requires that a charging document for charges
112 against a physician assistant, anesthesiologist assistant, perfusionist or practitioner
113 of respiratory care be filed by the Board.
114 Section 57 removes a requirement that the Board hold a hearing on a report
115 from the Attorney General that a licensee has violated certain laws prohibiting
116 industrial insurance fraud. Section 49 instead requires the Board to treat such a
117 report like a complaint, meaning that the Board would conduct an initial
118 investigation before deciding whether to proceed with disciplinary proceedings.
119 (NRS 630.311)
120 In certain circumstances that create doubt about the fitness of a physician,
121 physician assistant, practitioner of respiratory care or perfusionist to practice,
122 existing law authorizes the Board to require such a licensee to undergo certain
123 examinations to determine his or her fitness to practice. (NRS 630.318) Section 52:
124 (1) makes this provision additionally applicable to anesthesiologist assistants; and
125 (2) provides that the failure to submit to such an examination is grounds for the
126 summary suspension of a license pending further disciplinary proceedings.
127 Existing law authorizes the Board to summarily suspend a license pending
128 further disciplinary proceedings if the Board determines that the health, safety or
129 welfare of the public or any patient is at risk of imminent or continued harm. (NRS
130 630.326) Section 54: (1) additionally authorizes the Board to restrict the practice of
131 a licensee without suspending his or her license under such circumstances; and (2)
132 removes a requirement that the Board hold a hearing on the summary suspension of
133 a license within 60 days after the summary suspension. Sections 55 and 61 of this
134 bill authorize a court to stay an order of the Board suspending a license if the
135 suspension is not a summary suspension. Section 55 also prohibits a court from
136 staying an order of the Board summarily restricting the practice of a licensee.
137 Section 84 eliminates a duplicative provision authorizing the summary suspension
138 of a licensee’s authority to prescribe and dispense controlled substances for certain
139 violations related to such prescribing and dispensing, and section 53 of this bill
140 eliminates a reference to that provision.
141 Section 56: (1) makes revisions relating to collaboration between the Board and
142 other governmental entities investigating a person; and (2) authorizes the Board,
143 with authorization from a licensee, to cooperate with the employer of a licensee or
144 any other person or entity responsible for credentialing a licensee. Section 57
145 removes certain procedural requirements governing hearings conducted by the
146 Board. Section 58 of this bill revises requirements governing service of process in
147 proceedings before the Board. Section 59 removes a requirement that the Board
148 allow a complainant to participate in disciplinary proceedings. Section 60 of this
149 bill removes the ability for any person other than the respondent or a witness to be
150 held in contempt for certain conduct in a disciplinary proceeding. Section 62
151 removes authorization for a person whose license has been revoked by the Board to
152 reinstate his or her license without applying for a new license.
153 Existing law prohibits the Board from investigating or disciplining a physician
154 for: (1) disclosing to a governmental entity a violation of any law, rule or regulation
155 by an applicant for a license to practice medicine or a physician; or (2) cooperating
156 with a governmental entity that is conducting an investigation, hearing or inquiry
157 into such a violation. (NRS 630.364) Section 63 of this bill: (1) makes this
158 provision applicable to all licensees of the Board; and (2) requires the disclosure or
159 cooperation to be in good faith for the immunity from investigation or discipline to
160 apply.
161 Existing law prohibits a physician from administering or supervising the
162 administration of general anesthesia, moderate sedation or deep sedation: (1) in an
163 office or facility that does not hold certain permits; or (2) outside of this State.
164 (NRS 630.373) Section 65 of this bill makes this prohibition also applicable to: (1)
-
*AB319_R2*
– 5 –
165 physician assistants and anesthesiologist assistants; and (2) administering or
166 supervising the administration of tumescent anesthesia, except where authorized by
167 regulation of the Board. Sections 7, 68 and 72 of this bill require a physician,
168 physician assistant, advanced practice registered nurse or osteopathic physician
169 who performs a physical examination of a person who is at least 12 years of age but
170 not more than 18 years of age to screen the person for certain health conditions.
171 Existing law provides for the registration and regulation of certified registered
172 nurse anesthetists. (NRS 632.2395) Existing law authorizes a certified registered
173 nurse anesthetist working under the supervision of a physician licensed to practice
174 medicine or osteopathic medicine in this State to order, prescribe, possess and
175 administer controlled substances, poisons, dangerous drugs and devices to treat a
176 patient under the care of a licensed physician before, during and after surgery or
177 childbirth only in a critical access hospital. (NRS 632.2397) Section 70.5 of this
178 bill further authorizes a certified registered nurse anesthetist to perform such tasks
179 in a hospital located in a city whose population is less than 25,000 (currently all
180 cities except Carson City, Henderson, Las Vegas, North Las Vegas, Reno and
181 Sparks).
182 Existing law authorizes: (1) an unlicensed medical assistant to perform clinical
183 tasks under the supervision of a physician, osteopathic physician or physician
184 assistant in accordance with regulations adopted by the Board of Medical
185 Examiners or the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine, as appropriate; and (2)
186 those boards to discipline a physician, osteopathic physician or physician assistant
187 who fails to adequately supervise a medical assistant. (NRS 630.0129, 630.138,
188 630.306, 633.075, 633.293, 633.511) Sections 67, 70 and 71 of this bill similarly
189 authorize: (1) an unlicensed medical assistant to perform clinical tasks under the
190 supervision of a registered nurse in accordance with regulations of the State Board
191 of Nursing; and (2) the State Board of Nursing to discipline a registered nurse who
192 fails to adequately supervise a medical assistant. Section 69 of this bill establishes
193 the applicability of the definition of “medical assistant” set forth in section 67.

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of physicians, physician
2 assistants, anesthesiologist assistants, practitioners of respiratory care and
3 perfusionists by the Board of Medical Examiners. (Chapter 630 of NRS) Sections
4 11 and 14 of this bill revise provisions governing examinations that are necessary
5 for licensure as a physician. Section 14 also increases the amount of the fine that
6 the Board may impose on an applicant for a license as a physician who submits
7 false information in connection with the application.
8 Section 21 of this bill requires each licensee of the Board to maintain a
9 permanent electronic mail address for communication with the Board.
10 Existing law prescribes separate qualifications for licensure for: (1) persons
11 who received their medical education in the United States or Canada; and (2)
12 persons who received their medical education in other foreign countries. (NRS
13 630.160, 630.170, 630.195, 630.263, 630.264, 630.265) Existing law also requires a
14 physician to have completed certain residencies in ophthalmology in the United
15 States or Canada in order to perform laser surgery or intense pulsed light therapy on
16 the globe of the eye. (NRS 630.371) Sections 4, 5, 8, 14, 19, 26-28 and 64 of this
17 bill make various changes so that persons who received their medical education in
18 the United Kingdom, Australia or New Zealand, and other foreign countries whose
19 standards for medical education are determined to be equivalent by the Board, are
20 treated identically to persons who received their medical education in the United
21 States or Canada for those purposes.
22 Existing law requires: (1) an applicant for a license to practice medicine to hold
23 certain certifications or have completed or be enrolled in certain progressive
24 postgraduate education; and (2) a physician who performs certain procedures on the
25 eye to have completed certain progressive postgraduate education in
26 ophthalmology. (NRS 630.160, 630.371) Section 6 of this bill prescribes the
27 manner in which the Board must determine whether postgraduate education is
28 progressive for those purposes. Section 14 revises the amount of progressive
29 postgraduate education that a resident physician must have completed in order to be
30 eligible for a license.
31 Existing law authorizes a practitioner of respiratory care to perform certain
32 laboratory tests without obtaining certification as an assistant in a medical
33 laboratory. (NRS 652.210) Sections 9 and 82 of this bill authorize a practitioner of
34 respiratory care to perform certain moderate complexity tests without obtaining
35 such certification if: (1) the practitioner of respiratory care has been trained to
36 perform the test; and (2) the test is within the scope of practice of a practitioner of
37 respiratory care.
38 Sections 15, 16 and 84 of this bill revise and simplify provisions governing
39 licensure by endorsement as a physician by: (1) eliminating expedited licensure by
40 endorsement, except for certain persons affiliated with the Armed Forces of the
41 United States; and (2) making certain revisions relating to the qualifications for
42 licensure by endorsement. Sections 17, 18, 20, 23 and 30 of this bill eliminate
43 references to a section repealed by section 84.
44 Existing law authorizes the Board to require a licensee who has not practiced in
45 more than 24 consecutive months to take the same examination to test competency
46 as that given to applicants for a license. (NRS 630.257) Section 22 of this bill
47 revises this provision to apply to inactive licensees and applicants for a license who
48 have not actively practiced in more than 24 consecutive months. Section 22 also
49 authorizes the Board to require such a person to demonstrate his or her competency
50 in a manner other than by taking an examination. Sections 16, 28, 36, 40 and 41 of
51 this bill make conforming changes to add references to those requirements where
52 appropriate.
53 Existing law provides for the issuance of various special licenses to practice
54 medicine. (NRS 630.258-630.266) Section 23 removes the requirement that the
-
*AB319_R2*

– 3 –
55 Board automatically issue a special volunteer license, which authorizes certain
56 retired physicians to continue practicing on a volunteer basis, to a person who
57 possesses the required qualifications for such a license. Section 24 of this bill
58 eliminates the specific statutory requirements for licensure from which a person
59 applying for licensure as an administrative physician is exempt and instead requires
60 the Board to adopt regulations prescribing the requirements from which such an
61 applicant is exempt. Sections 25 and 30 of this bill eliminate a special license that
62 allows a licensed physician of another state to come into this State to care for a
63 specific patient in association with a physician licensed in this State. Section 25
64 also eliminates a restricted license for a specified period if the Board determines the
65 applicant needs supervision or restriction. Sections 1, 25 and 30 of this bill revise
66 the name of a special purpose license, which allows an out-of-state physician to
67 provide certain medical services to patients in this State electronically,
68 telephonically or by fiber optics, to instead be called a telemedicine license.
69 Existing law establishes fees for the issuance and renewal of a license as a
70 physician assistant or anesthesiologist assistant who is simultaneously licensed by
71 the Board of Medical Examiners and the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine that
72 are one-half of the amount of the standard fees for the issuance and renewal of such
73 a license, meaning that such a person is required to pay one-half of the standard
74 licensure fees to each of those boards. (NRS 630.268, 633.501) If a person who
75 pays such a reduced fee to one of those boards fails to also pay the required fee to
76 the other board within 12 months, sections 29, 31-33, 38, 42 and 76-81 of this bill
77 require the person to pay to the board to whom the person has paid a fee the
78 difference between the reduced fee and the standard fee. Sections 12, 13 and 73-75
79 of this bill require the Board of Medical Examiners and the State Board of
80 Osteopathic Medicine to share information as necessary to enforce that
81 requirement. Section 30 eliminates certain fees charged by the Board of Medical
82 Examiners.
83 Section 10 of this bill exempts certain students who engage in the supervised
84 practice of perfusion from the requirement to be licensed by the Board of Medical
85 Examiners. Sections 34-37 and 84 of this bill remove a requirement that an
86 applicant for a license as a perfusionist pass an examination given by the American
87 Board of Cardiovascular Perfusion, or its successor organization, and instead
88 require such an applicant to be certified by that organization. Section 39 of this bill
89 eliminates a provision prohibiting the Board from requiring a physician assistant to
90 be certified by a nationally recognized organization for the accreditation of
91 physician assistants to satisfy applicable continuing education requirements.
92 Sections 40 and 41 revise the conditions under which the Board may deny an
93 application for licensure by endorsement as a physician assistant. Section 43 of this
94 bill eliminates certain educational qualifications for licensure as a practitioner of
95 respiratory care.
96 Sections 44 and 45 of this bill clarify certain grounds for discipline against a
97 licensee of the Board. Section 45 also authorizes the Board to discipline a licensee
98 who fails to cooperate with an investigation of the Board. Sections 46-49, 52 and
99 62 of this bill revise certain provisions regarding the provision to the Board of
100 information relating to certain licensees, the examination to determine the fitness of
101 certain licensees and the removal of limitations or suspensions of licenses to be
102 applicable to all licensees of the Board. Section 46 provides that certain reports
103 filed by an insurer relating to malpractice actions are public records. Section 51 of
104 this bill provides that the Board is not required to review a complaint that is not
105 within the jurisdiction of the Board.
106 Existing law refers to the document that the Board files to initiate a formal
107 disciplinary proceeding as a formal complaint. (NRS 630.311) However, existing
108 law regarding the procedure of licensing boards generally refers to such a document
109 as a charging document. (NRS 622A.300) Sections 3, 50, 51, 54, 56, 57 and 59 of
-
*AB319_R2*

– 4 –
110 this bill standardize terminology so that such a document is referred to as a
111 charging document. Section 50 also requires that a charging document for charges
112 against a physician assistant, anesthesiologist assistant, perfusionist or practitioner
113 of respiratory care be filed by the Board.
114 Section 57 removes a requirement that the Board hold a hearing on a report
115 from the Attorney General that a licensee has violated certain laws prohibiting
116 industrial insurance fraud. Section 49 instead requires the Board to treat such a
117 report like a complaint, meaning that the Board would conduct an initial
118 investigation before deciding whether to proceed with disciplinary proceedings.
119 (NRS 630.311)
120 In certain circumstances that create doubt about the fitness of a physician,
121 physician assistant, practitioner of respiratory care or perfusionist to practice,
122 existing law authorizes the Board to require such a licensee to undergo certain
123 examinations to determine his or her fitness to practice. (NRS 630.318) Section 52:
124 (1) makes this provision additionally applicable to anesthesiologist assistants; and
125 (2) provides that the failure to submit to such an examination is grounds for the
126 summary suspension of a license pending further disciplinary proceedings.
127 Existing law authorizes the Board to summarily suspend a license pending
128 further disciplinary proceedings if the Board determines that the health, safety or
129 welfare of the public or any patient is at risk of imminent or continued harm. (NRS
130 630.326) Section 54: (1) additionally authorizes the Board to restrict the practice of
131 a licensee without suspending his or her license under such circumstances; and (2)
132 removes a requirement that the Board hold a hearing on the summary suspension of
133 a license within 60 days after the summary suspension. Sections 55 and 61 of this
134 bill authorize a court to stay an order of the Board suspending a license if the
135 suspension is not a summary suspension. Section 55 also prohibits a court from
136 staying an order of the Board summarily restricting the practice of a licensee.
137 Section 84 eliminates a duplicative provision authorizing the summary suspension
138 of a licensee’s authority to prescribe and dispense controlled substances for certain
139 violations related to such prescribing and dispensing, and section 53 of this bill
140 eliminates a reference to that provision.
141 Section 56: (1) makes revisions relating to collaboration between the Board and
142 other governmental entities investigating a person; and (2) authorizes the Board,
143 with authorization from a licensee, to cooperate with the employer of a licensee or
144 any other person or entity responsible for credentialing a licensee. Section 57
145 removes certain procedural requirements governing hearings conducted by the
146 Board. Section 58 of this bill revises requirements governing service of process in
147 proceedings before the Board. Section 59 removes a requirement that the Board
148 allow a complainant to participate in disciplinary proceedings. Section 60 of this
149 bill removes the ability for any person other than the respondent or a witness to be
150 held in contempt for certain conduct in a disciplinary proceeding. Section 62
151 removes authorization for a person whose license has been revoked by the Board to
152 reinstate his or her license without applying for a new license.
153 Existing law prohibits the Board from investigating or disciplining a physician
154 for: (1) disclosing to a governmental entity a violation of any law, rule or regulation
155 by an applicant for a license to practice medicine or a physician; or (2) cooperating
156 with a governmental entity that is conducting an investigation, hearing or inquiry
157 into such a violation. (NRS 630.364) Section 63 of this bill: (1) makes this
158 provision applicable to all licensees of the Board; and (2) requires the disclosure or
159 cooperation to be in good faith for the immunity from investigation or discipline to
160 apply.
161 Existing law prohibits a physician from administering or supervising the
162 administration of general anesthesia, moderate sedation or deep sedation: (1) in an
163 office or facility that does not hold certain permits; or (2) outside of this State.
164 (NRS 630.373) Section 65 of this bill makes this prohibition also applicable to: (1)
-
*AB319_R2*

– 5 –
165 physician assistants and anesthesiologist assistants; and (2) administering or
166 supervising the administration of tumescent anesthesia, except where authorized by
167 regulation of the Board. Sections 7, 68 and 72 of this bill require a physician,
168 physician assistant, advanced practice registered nurse or osteopathic physician
169 who performs a physical examination of a person who is at least 12 years of age but
170 not more than 18 years of age to screen the person for certain health conditions.
171 Existing law provides for the registration and regulation of certified registered
172 nurse anesthetists. (NRS 632.2395) Existing law authorizes a certified registered
173 nurse anesthetist working under the supervision of a physician licensed to practice
174 medicine or osteopathic medicine in this State to order, prescribe, possess and
175 administer controlled substances, poisons, dangerous drugs and devices to treat a
176 patient under the care of a licensed physician before, during and after surgery or
177 childbirth only in a critical access hospital. (NRS 632.2397) Section 70.5 of this
178 bill further authorizes a certified registered nurse anesthetist to perform such tasks
179 in a hospital located in a city whose population is less than 25,000 (currently all
180 cities except Carson City, Henderson, Las Vegas, North Las Vegas, Reno and
181 Sparks).
182 Existing law authorizes: (1) an unlicensed medical assistant to perform clinical
183 tasks under the supervision of a physician, osteopathic physician or physician
184 assistant in accordance with regulations adopted by the Board of Medical
185 Examiners or the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine, as appropriate; and (2)
186 those boards to discipline a physician, osteopathic physician or physician assistant
187 who fails to adequately supervise a medical assistant. (NRS 630.0129, 630.138,
188 630.306, 633.075, 633.293, 633.511) Sections 67, 70 and 71 of this bill similarly
189 authorize: (1) an unlicensed medical assistant to perform clinical tasks under the
190 supervision of a registered nurse in accordance with regulations of the State Board
191 of Nursing; and (2) the State Board of Nursing to discipline a registered nurse who
192 fails to adequately supervise a medical assistant. Section 69 of this bill establishes
193 the applicability of the definition of “medical assistant” set forth in section 67.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 629.515 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 629.515 1. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection,
3 before a provider of health care who is located at a distant site may
4 use telehealth to direct or manage the care or render a diagnosis of a
5 patient who is located at an originating site in this State or write a
6 treatment order or prescription for such a patient, the provider must
7 hold a valid license or certificate to practice his or her profession in
8 this State, including, without limitation, a [special purpose]
9 telemedicine license issued pursuant to NRS 630.261. The
10 requirements of this subsection do not apply to a provider of health
11 care who is providing services within the scope of his or her
12 employment by or pursuant to a contract entered into with an urban
13 Indian organization, as defined in 25 U.S.C. § 1603.
14 2. The provisions of this section must not be interpreted or
15 construed to:

4 setting that is not authorized by law or in a manner that violates the
5 standard of care required of the provider of health care.
6 3. A provider of health care who is located at a distant site and
7 uses telehealth to direct or manage the care or render a diagnosis of
8 a patient who is located at an originating site in this State or write a

15 (b) Shall comply with all federal and state laws that would apply
16 if the provider were located at a distant site in this State.
17 4. A provider of health care may establish a relationship with a
