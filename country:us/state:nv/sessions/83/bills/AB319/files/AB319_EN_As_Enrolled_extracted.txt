Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of physicians, physician
assistants, anesthesiologist assistants, practitioners of respiratory care and
perfusionists by the Board of Medical Examiners. (Chapter 630 of NRS) Sections
11 and 14 of this bill revise provisions governing examinations that are necessary
for licensure as a physician. Section 14 also increases the amount of the fine that
the Board may impose on an applicant for a license as a physician who submits
false information in connection with the application.

Section 2:
Section 21 of this bill requires each licensee of the Board to maintain a
permanent electronic mail address for communication with the Board.
Existing law prescribes separate qualifications for licensure for: (1) persons
who received their medical education in the United States or Canada; and (2)
persons who received their medical education in other foreign countries. (NRS

Section 3:
630.160, 630.170, 630.195, 630.263, 630.264, 630.265) Existing law also requires a
physician to have completed certain residencies in ophthalmology in the United
States or Canada in order to perform laser surgery or intense pulsed light therapy on
the globe of the eye. (NRS 630.371) Sections 4, 5, 8, 14, 19, 26-28 and 64 of this
bill make various changes so that persons who received their medical education in
the United Kingdom, Australia or New Zealand, and other foreign countries whose
standards for medical education are determined to be equivalent by the Board, are
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 2 –
treated identically to persons who received their medical education in the United
States or Canada for those purposes.
Existing law requires: (1) an applicant for a license to practice medicine to hold
certain certifications or have completed or be enrolled in certain progressive
postgraduate education; and (2) a physician who performs certain procedures on the
eye to have completed certain progressive postgraduate education in
ophthalmology. (NRS 630.160, 630.371) Section 6 of this bill prescribes the
manner in which the Board must determine whether postgraduate education is
progressive for those purposes. Section 14 revises the amount of progressive
postgraduate education that a resident physician must have completed in order to be
eligible for a license.
Existing law authorizes a practitioner of respiratory care to perform certain
laboratory tests without obtaining certification as an assistant in a medical
laboratory. (NRS 652.210) Sections 9 and 82 of this bill authorize a practitioner of
respiratory care to perform certain moderate complexity tests without obtaining
such certification if: (1) the practitioner of respiratory care has been trained to
perform the test; and (2) the test is within the scope of practice of a practitioner of
respiratory care.

Section 4:
Sections 15, 16 and 84 of this bill revise and simplify provisions governing
licensure by endorsement as a physician by: (1) eliminating expedited licensure by
endorsement, except for certain persons affiliated with the Armed Forces of the
United States; and (2) making certain revisions relating to the qualifications for
licensure by endorsement. Sections 17, 18, 20, 23 and 30 of this bill eliminate
references to a section repealed by section 84.
Existing law authorizes the Board to require a licensee who has not practiced in
more than 24 consecutive months to take the same examination to test competency
as that given to applicants for a license. (NRS 630.257) Section 22 of this bill
revises this provision to apply to inactive licensees and applicants for a license who
have not actively practiced in more than 24 consecutive months. Section 22 also
authorizes the Board to require such a person to demonstrate his or her competency
in a manner other than by taking an examination. Sections 16, 28, 36, 40 and 41 of
this bill make conforming changes to add references to those requirements where
appropriate.
Existing law provides for the issuance of various special licenses to practice
medicine. (NRS 630.258-630.266) Section 23 removes the requirement that the
Board automatically issue a special volunteer license, which authorizes certain
retired physicians to continue practicing on a volunteer basis, to a person who
possesses the required qualifications for such a license. Section 24 of this bill
eliminates the specific statutory requirements for licensure from which a person
applying for licensure as an administrative physician is exempt and instead requires
the Board to adopt regulations prescribing the requirements from which such an
applicant is exempt. Sections 25 and 30 of this bill eliminate a special license that
allows a licensed physician of another state to come into this State to care for a
specific patient in association with a physician licensed in this State. Section 25
also eliminates a restricted license for a specified period if the Board determines the
applicant needs supervision or restriction. Sections 1, 25 and 30 of this bill revise
the name of a special purpose license, which allows an out-of-state physician to
provide certain medical services to patients in this State electronically,
telephonically or by fiber optics, to instead be called a telemedicine license.
Existing law establishes fees for the issuance and renewal of a license as a
physician assistant or anesthesiologist assistant who is simultaneously licensed by
the Board of Medical Examiners and the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine that
are one-half of the amount of the standard fees for the issuance and renewal of such
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 3 –
a license, meaning that such a person is required to pay one-half of the standard
licensure fees to each of those boards. (NRS 630.268, 633.501) If a person who
pays such a reduced fee to one of those boards fails to also pay the required fee to
the other board within 12 months, sections 29, 31-33, 38, 42 and 76-81 of this bill
require the person to pay to the board to whom the person has paid a fee the
difference between the reduced fee and the standard fee. Sections 12, 13 and 73-75
of this bill require the Board of Medical Examiners and the State Board of
Osteopathic Medicine to share information as necessary to enforce that
requirement. Section 30 eliminates certain fees charged by the Board of Medical
Examiners.

Section 5:
Section 10 of this bill exempts certain students who engage in the supervised
practice of perfusion from the requirement to be licensed by the Board of Medical
Examiners. Sections 34-37 and 84 of this bill remove a requirement that an
applicant for a license as a perfusionist pass an examination given by the American
Board of Cardiovascular Perfusion, or its successor organization, and instead
require such an applicant to be certified by that organization. Section 39 of this bill
eliminates a provision prohibiting the Board from requiring a physician assistant to
be certified by a nationally recognized organization for the accreditation of
physician assistants to satisfy applicable continuing education requirements.

Section 6:
Sections 40 and 41 revise the conditions under which the Board may deny an
application for licensure by endorsement as a physician assistant. Section 43 of this
bill eliminates certain educational qualifications for licensure as a practitioner of
respiratory care.

Section 7:
Sections 44 and 45 of this bill clarify certain grounds for discipline against a
licensee of the Board. Section 45 also authorizes the Board to discipline a licensee
who fails to cooperate with an investigation of the Board. Sections 46-49, 52 and
62 of this bill revise certain provisions regarding the provision to the Board of
information relating to certain licensees, the examination to determine the fitness of
certain licensees and the removal of limitations or suspensions of licenses to be
applicable to all licensees of the Board. Section 46 provides that certain reports
filed by an insurer relating to malpractice actions are public records. Section 51 of
this bill provides that the Board is not required to review a complaint that is not
within the jurisdiction of the Board.
Existing law refers to the document that the Board files to initiate a formal
disciplinary proceeding as a formal complaint. (NRS 630.311) However, existing
law regarding the procedure of licensing boards generally refers to such a document
as a charging document. (NRS 622A.300) Sections 3, 50, 51, 54, 56, 57 and 59 of
this bill standardize terminology so that such a document is referred to as a
charging document. Section 50 also requires that a charging document for charges
against a physician assistant, anesthesiologist assistant, perfusionist or practitioner
of respiratory care be filed by the Board.

Section 8:
Section 57 removes a requirement that the Board hold a hearing on a report
from the Attorney General that a licensee has violated certain laws prohibiting
industrial insurance fraud. Section 49 instead requires the Board to treat such a
report like a complaint, meaning that the Board would conduct an initial
investigation before deciding whether to proceed with disciplinary proceedings.
(NRS 630.311)
In certain circumstances that create doubt about the fitness of a physician,
physician assistant, practitioner of respiratory care or perfusionist to practice,
existing law authorizes the Board to require such a licensee to undergo certain
examinations to determine his or her fitness to practice. (NRS 630.318) Section 52:
(1) makes this provision additionally applicable to anesthesiologist assistants; and
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 4 –
(2) provides that the failure to submit to such an examination is grounds for the
summary suspension of a license pending further disciplinary proceedings.
Existing law authorizes the Board to summarily suspend a license pending
further disciplinary proceedings if the Board determines that the health, safety or
welfare of the public or any patient is at risk of imminent or continued harm. (NRS

Section 9:
630.326) Section 54: (1) additionally authorizes the Board to restrict the practice of
a licensee without suspending his or her license under such circumstances; and (2)
removes a requirement that the Board hold a hearing on the summary suspension of
a license within 60 days after the summary suspension. Sections 55 and 61 of this
bill authorize a court to stay an order of the Board suspending a license if the
suspension is not a summary suspension. Section 55 also prohibits a court from
staying an order of the Board summarily restricting the practice of a licensee.

Section 10:
Section 84 eliminates a duplicative provision authorizing the summary suspension
of a licensee’s authority to prescribe and dispense controlled substances for certain
violations related to such prescribing and dispensing, and section 53 of this bill
eliminates a reference to that provision.

Section 11:
Section 56: (1) makes revisions relating to collaboration between the Board and
other governmental entities investigating a person; and (2) authorizes the Board,
with authorization from a licensee, to cooperate with the employer of a licensee or
any other person or entity responsible for credentialing a licensee. Section 57
removes certain procedural requirements governing hearings conducted by the
Board. Section 58 of this bill revises requirements governing service of process in
proceedings before the Board. Section 59 removes a requirement that the Board
allow a complainant to participate in disciplinary proceedings. Section 60 of this
bill removes the ability for any person other than the respondent or a witness to be
held in contempt for certain conduct in a disciplinary proceeding. Section 62
removes authorization for a person whose license has been revoked by the Board to
reinstate his or her license without applying for a new license.
Existing law prohibits the Board from investigating or disciplining a physician
for: (1) disclosing to a governmental entity a violation of any law, rule or regulation
by an applicant for a license to practice medicine or a physician; or (2) cooperating
with a governmental entity that is conducting an investigation, hearing or inquiry
into such a violation. (NRS 630.364) Section 63 of this bill: (1) makes this
provision applicable to all licensees of the Board; and (2) requires the disclosure or
cooperation to be in good faith for the immunity from investigation or discipline to
apply.
Existing law prohibits a physician from administering or supervising the
administration of general anesthesia, moderate sedation or deep sedation: (1) in an
office or facility that does not hold certain permits; or (2) outside of this State.
(NRS 630.373) Section 65 of this bill makes this prohibition also applicable to: (1)
physician assistants and anesthesiologist assistants; and (2) administering or
supervising the administration of tumescent anesthesia, except where authorized by
regulation of the Board. Sections 7, 68 and 72 of this bill require a physician,
physician assistant, advanced practice registered nurse or osteopathic physician
who performs a physical examination of a person who is at least 12 years of age but
not more than 18 years of age to screen the person for certain health conditions.
Existing law provides for the registration and regulation of certified registered
nurse anesthetists. (NRS 632.2395) Existing law authorizes a certified registered
nurse anesthetist working under the supervision of a physician licensed to practice
medicine or osteopathic medicine in this State to order, prescribe, possess and
administer controlled substances, poisons, dangerous drugs and devices to treat a
patient under the care of a licensed physician before, during and after surgery or
childbirth only in a critical access hospital. (NRS 632.2397) Section 70.5 of this
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 5 –
bill further authorizes a certified registered nurse anesthetist to perform such tasks
in a hospital located in a city whose population is less than 25,000 (currently all
cities except Carson City, Henderson, Las Vegas, North Las Vegas, Reno and
Sparks).
Existing law authorizes: (1) an unlicensed medical assistant to perform clinical
tasks under the supervision of a physician, osteopathic physician or physician
assistant in accordance with regulations adopted by the Board of Medical
Examiners or the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine, as appropriate; and (2)
those boards to discipline a physician, osteopathic physician or physician assistant
who fails to adequately supervise a medical assistant. (NRS 630.0129, 630.138,

Section 12:
630.306, 633.075, 633.293, 633.511) Sections 67, 70 and 71 of this bill similarly
authorize: (1) an unlicensed medical assistant to perform clinical tasks under the
supervision of a registered nurse in accordance with regulations of the State Board
of Nursing; and (2) the State Board of Nursing to discipline a registered nurse who
fails to adequately supervise a medical assistant. Section 69 of this bill establishes
the applicability of the definition of “medical assistant” set forth in section 67.

Assembly Bill No. 319–Assemblymember Orentlicher
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to health care; making various revisions governing
the qualifications and procedure for licensure as a physician,
physician assistant, practitioner of respiratory care or
perfusionist; requiring screening of youth for certain health
conditions when certain physical examinations are
conducted; revising the authority of a practitioner of
respiratory care to perform certain laboratory tests; requiring
certain sharing of information between the Board of Medical
Examiners and the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine;
authorizing the Board of Medical Examiners to require
certain competency demonstrations; eliminating certain
special licenses; revising provisions related to fees owed to
the Board of Medical Examiners or the State Board of
Osteopathic Medicine; eliminating certain fees; revising
investigation procedures and grounds for discipline against a
licensee of the Board of Medical Examiners; revising
requirements governing certain medical procedures;
authorizing a medical assistant to perform tasks under the
supervision of a registered nurse; authorizing a certified
registered nurse anesthetist to perform certain tasks in certain
hospitals; authorizing discipline against a registered nurse
who fails to adequately supervise a medical assistant; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of physicians, physician
assistants, anesthesiologist assistants, practitioners of respiratory care and
perfusionists by the Board of Medical Examiners. (Chapter 630 of NRS) Sections
11 and 14 of this bill revise provisions governing examinations that are necessary
for licensure as a physician. Section 14 also increases the amount of the fine that
the Board may impose on an applicant for a license as a physician who submits
false information in connection with the application.
Section 21 of this bill requires each licensee of the Board to maintain a
permanent electronic mail address for communication with the Board.
Existing law prescribes separate qualifications for licensure for: (1) persons
who received their medical education in the United States or Canada; and (2)
persons who received their medical education in other foreign countries. (NRS
630.160, 630.170, 630.195, 630.263, 630.264, 630.265) Existing law also requires a
physician to have completed certain residencies in ophthalmology in the United
States or Canada in order to perform laser surgery or intense pulsed light therapy on
the globe of the eye. (NRS 630.371) Sections 4, 5, 8, 14, 19, 26-28 and 64 of this
bill make various changes so that persons who received their medical education in
the United Kingdom, Australia or New Zealand, and other foreign countries whose
standards for medical education are determined to be equivalent by the Board, are
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 2 –
treated identically to persons who received their medical education in the United
States or Canada for those purposes.
Existing law requires: (1) an applicant for a license to practice medicine to hold
certain certifications or have completed or be enrolled in certain progressive
postgraduate education; and (2) a physician who performs certain procedures on the
eye to have completed certain progressive postgraduate education in
ophthalmology. (NRS 630.160, 630.371) Section 6 of this bill prescribes the
manner in which the Board must determine whether postgraduate education is
progressive for those purposes. Section 14 revises the amount of progressive
postgraduate education that a resident physician must have completed in order to be
eligible for a license.
Existing law authorizes a practitioner of respiratory care to perform certain
laboratory tests without obtaining certification as an assistant in a medical
laboratory. (NRS 652.210) Sections 9 and 82 of this bill authorize a practitioner of
respiratory care to perform certain moderate complexity tests without obtaining
such certification if: (1) the practitioner of respiratory care has been trained to
perform the test; and (2) the test is within the scope of practice of a practitioner of
respiratory care.
Sections 15, 16 and 84 of this bill revise and simplify provisions governing
licensure by endorsement as a physician by: (1) eliminating expedited licensure by
endorsement, except for certain persons affiliated with the Armed Forces of the
United States; and (2) making certain revisions relating to the qualifications for
licensure by endorsement. Sections 17, 18, 20, 23 and 30 of this bill eliminate
references to a section repealed by section 84.
Existing law authorizes the Board to require a licensee who has not practiced in
more than 24 consecutive months to take the same examination to test competency
as that given to applicants for a license. (NRS 630.257) Section 22 of this bill
revises this provision to apply to inactive licensees and applicants for a license who
have not actively practiced in more than 24 consecutive months. Section 22 also
authorizes the Board to require such a person to demonstrate his or her competency
in a manner other than by taking an examination. Sections 16, 28, 36, 40 and 41 of
this bill make conforming changes to add references to those requirements where
appropriate.
Existing law provides for the issuance of various special licenses to practice
medicine. (NRS 630.258-630.266) Section 23 removes the requirement that the
Board automatically issue a special volunteer license, which authorizes certain
retired physicians to continue practicing on a volunteer basis, to a person who
possesses the required qualifications for such a license. Section 24 of this bill
eliminates the specific statutory requirements for licensure from which a person
applying for licensure as an administrative physician is exempt and instead requires
the Board to adopt regulations prescribing the requirements from which such an
applicant is exempt. Sections 25 and 30 of this bill eliminate a special license that
allows a licensed physician of another state to come into this State to care for a
specific patient in association with a physician licensed in this State. Section 25
also eliminates a restricted license for a specified period if the Board determines the
applicant needs supervision or restriction. Sections 1, 25 and 30 of this bill revise
the name of a special purpose license, which allows an out-of-state physician to
provide certain medical services to patients in this State electronically,
telephonically or by fiber optics, to instead be called a telemedicine license.
Existing law establishes fees for the issuance and renewal of a license as a
physician assistant or anesthesiologist assistant who is simultaneously licensed by
the Board of Medical Examiners and the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine that
are one-half of the amount of the standard fees for the issuance and renewal of such
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 3 –
a license, meaning that such a person is required to pay one-half of the standard
licensure fees to each of those boards. (NRS 630.268, 633.501) If a person who
pays such a reduced fee to one of those boards fails to also pay the required fee to
the other board within 12 months, sections 29, 31-33, 38, 42 and 76-81 of this bill
require the person to pay to the board to whom the person has paid a fee the
difference between the reduced fee and the standard fee. Sections 12, 13 and 73-75
of this bill require the Board of Medical Examiners and the State Board of
Osteopathic Medicine to share information as necessary to enforce that
requirement. Section 30 eliminates certain fees charged by the Board of Medical
Examiners.
Section 10 of this bill exempts certain students who engage in the supervised
practice of perfusion from the requirement to be licensed by the Board of Medical
Examiners. Sections 34-37 and 84 of this bill remove a requirement that an
applicant for a license as a perfusionist pass an examination given by the American
Board of Cardiovascular Perfusion, or its successor organization, and instead
require such an applicant to be certified by that organization. Section 39 of this bill
eliminates a provision prohibiting the Board from requiring a physician assistant to
be certified by a nationally recognized organization for the accreditation of
physician assistants to satisfy applicable continuing education requirements.
Sections 40 and 41 revise the conditions under which the Board may deny an
application for licensure by endorsement as a physician assistant. Section 43 of this
bill eliminates certain educational qualifications for licensure as a practitioner of
respiratory care.
Sections 44 and 45 of this bill clarify certain grounds for discipline against a
licensee of the Board. Section 45 also authorizes the Board to discipline a licensee
who fails to cooperate with an investigation of the Board. Sections 46-49, 52 and
62 of this bill revise certain provisions regarding the provision to the Board of
information relating to certain licensees, the examination to determine the fitness of
certain licensees and the removal of limitations or suspensions of licenses to be
applicable to all licensees of the Board. Section 46 provides that certain reports
filed by an insurer relating to malpractice actions are public records. Section 51 of
this bill provides that the Board is not required to review a complaint that is not
within the jurisdiction of the Board.
Existing law refers to the document that the Board files to initiate a formal
disciplinary proceeding as a formal complaint. (NRS 630.311) However, existing
law regarding the procedure of licensing boards generally refers to such a document
as a charging document. (NRS 622A.300) Sections 3, 50, 51, 54, 56, 57 and 59 of
this bill standardize terminology so that such a document is referred to as a
charging document. Section 50 also requires that a charging document for charges
against a physician assistant, anesthesiologist assistant, perfusionist or practitioner
of respiratory care be filed by the Board.
Section 57 removes a requirement that the Board hold a hearing on a report
from the Attorney General that a licensee has violated certain laws prohibiting
industrial insurance fraud. Section 49 instead requires the Board to treat such a
report like a complaint, meaning that the Board would conduct an initial
investigation before deciding whether to proceed with disciplinary proceedings.
(NRS 630.311)
In certain circumstances that create doubt about the fitness of a physician,
physician assistant, practitioner of respiratory care or perfusionist to practice,
existing law authorizes the Board to require such a licensee to undergo certain
examinations to determine his or her fitness to practice. (NRS 630.318) Section 52:
(1) makes this provision additionally applicable to anesthesiologist assistants; and
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 4 –
(2) provides that the failure to submit to such an examination is grounds for the
summary suspension of a license pending further disciplinary proceedings.
Existing law authorizes the Board to summarily suspend a license pending
further disciplinary proceedings if the Board determines that the health, safety or
welfare of the public or any patient is at risk of imminent or continued harm. (NRS
630.326) Section 54: (1) additionally authorizes the Board to restrict the practice of
a licensee without suspending his or her license under such circumstances; and (2)
removes a requirement that the Board hold a hearing on the summary suspension of
a license within 60 days after the summary suspension. Sections 55 and 61 of this
bill authorize a court to stay an order of the Board suspending a license if the
suspension is not a summary suspension. Section 55 also prohibits a court from
staying an order of the Board summarily restricting the practice of a licensee.
Section 84 eliminates a duplicative provision authorizing the summary suspension
of a licensee’s authority to prescribe and dispense controlled substances for certain
violations related to such prescribing and dispensing, and section 53 of this bill
eliminates a reference to that provision.
Section 56: (1) makes revisions relating to collaboration between the Board and
other governmental entities investigating a person; and (2) authorizes the Board,
with authorization from a licensee, to cooperate with the employer of a licensee or
any other person or entity responsible for credentialing a licensee. Section 57
removes certain procedural requirements governing hearings conducted by the
Board. Section 58 of this bill revises requirements governing service of process in
proceedings before the Board. Section 59 removes a requirement that the Board
allow a complainant to participate in disciplinary proceedings. Section 60 of this
bill removes the ability for any person other than the respondent or a witness to be
held in contempt for certain conduct in a disciplinary proceeding. Section 62
removes authorization for a person whose license has been revoked by the Board to
reinstate his or her license without applying for a new license.
Existing law prohibits the Board from investigating or disciplining a physician
for: (1) disclosing to a governmental entity a violation of any law, rule or regulation
by an applicant for a license to practice medicine or a physician; or (2) cooperating
with a governmental entity that is conducting an investigation, hearing or inquiry
into such a violation. (NRS 630.364) Section 63 of this bill: (1) makes this
provision applicable to all licensees of the Board; and (2) requires the disclosure or
cooperation to be in good faith for the immunity from investigation or discipline to
apply.
Existing law prohibits a physician from administering or supervising the
administration of general anesthesia, moderate sedation or deep sedation: (1) in an
office or facility that does not hold certain permits; or (2) outside of this State.
(NRS 630.373) Section 65 of this bill makes this prohibition also applicable to: (1)
physician assistants and anesthesiologist assistants; and (2) administering or
supervising the administration of tumescent anesthesia, except where authorized by
regulation of the Board. Sections 7, 68 and 72 of this bill require a physician,
physician assistant, advanced practice registered nurse or osteopathic physician
who performs a physical examination of a person who is at least 12 years of age but
not more than 18 years of age to screen the person for certain health conditions.
Existing law provides for the registration and regulation of certified registered
nurse anesthetists. (NRS 632.2395) Existing law authorizes a certified registered
nurse anesthetist working under the supervision of a physician licensed to practice
medicine or osteopathic medicine in this State to order, prescribe, possess and
administer controlled substances, poisons, dangerous drugs and devices to treat a
patient under the care of a licensed physician before, during and after surgery or
childbirth only in a critical access hospital. (NRS 632.2397) Section 70.5 of this
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 5 –
bill further authorizes a certified registered nurse anesthetist to perform such tasks
in a hospital located in a city whose population is less than 25,000 (currently all
cities except Carson City, Henderson, Las Vegas, North Las Vegas, Reno and
Sparks).
Existing law authorizes: (1) an unlicensed medical assistant to perform clinical
tasks under the supervision of a physician, osteopathic physician or physician
assistant in accordance with regulations adopted by the Board of Medical
Examiners or the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine, as appropriate; and (2)
those boards to discipline a physician, osteopathic physician or physician assistant
who fails to adequately supervise a medical assistant. (NRS 630.0129, 630.138,
630.306, 633.075, 633.293, 633.511) Sections 67, 70 and 71 of this bill similarly
authorize: (1) an unlicensed medical assistant to perform clinical tasks under the
