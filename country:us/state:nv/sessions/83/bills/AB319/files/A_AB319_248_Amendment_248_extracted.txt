Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of physicians, physician assistants,
2 anesthesiologist assistants, practitioners of respiratory care and perfusionists by the Board of
3 Medical Examiners. (Chapter 630 of NRS) Sections 11 and 14 of this bill revise provisions
4 governing examinations that are necessary for licensure as a physician. Section 14 also
5 increases the amount of the fine that the Board may impose on an applicant for a license as a
6 physician who submits false information in connection with the application.
7 Section 21 of this bill requires each licensee of the Board to maintain a permanent
8 electronic mail address for communication with the Board.
9 Existing law prescribes separate qualifications for licensure for: (1) persons who received
10 their medical education in the United States or Canada; and (2) persons who received their
11 medical education in other foreign countries. (NRS 630.160, 630.170, 630.195, 630.263,
12 630.264, 630.265) Existing law also requires a physician to have completed certain
13 residencies in ophthalmology in the United States or Canada in order to perform laser surgery
14 or intense pulsed light therapy on the globe of the eye. (NRS 630.371) Sections 4, 5, 8, 14, 19,
Assembly Amendment No. 248 to Assembly Bill No. 319 Page 4
15 26-28 and 64 of this bill make various changes so that persons who received their medical
16 education in the United Kingdom, Australia or New Zealand, and other foreign countries
17 whose standards for medical education are determined to be equivalent by the Board, are
18 treated identically to persons who received their medical education in the United States or
19 Canada for those purposes.
20 Existing law requires: (1) an applicant for a license to practice medicine to hold certain
21 certifications or have completed or be enrolled in certain progressive postgraduate education;
22 and (2) a physician who performs certain procedures on the eye to have completed certain
23 progressive postgraduate education in ophthalmology. (NRS 630.160, 630.371) Section 6 of
24 this bill prescribes the manner in which the Board must determine whether postgraduate
25 education is progressive for those purposes. Section 14 revises the amount of progressive
26 postgraduate education that a resident physician must have completed in order to be eligible
27 for a license.
28 Existing law authorizes a practitioner of respiratory care to perform certain laboratory
29 tests without obtaining certification as an assistant in a medical laboratory. (NRS 652.210)
30 Sections 9 and 82 of this bill authorize a practitioner of respiratory care to perform certain
31 moderate complexity tests without obtaining such certification if: (1) the practitioner of
32 respiratory care has been trained to perform the test; and (2) the test is within the scope of
33 practice of a practitioner of respiratory care.
34 Sections 15, 16 and 84 of this bill revise and simplify provisions governing licensure by
35 endorsement as a physician by: (1) eliminating expedited licensure by endorsement, except for
36 certain persons affiliated with the Armed Forces of the United States; and (2) making certain
37 revisions relating to the qualifications for licensure by endorsement. Sections 17, 18, 20, 23
38 and 30 of this bill eliminate references to a section repealed by section 84.
39 Existing law authorizes the Board to require a licensee who has not practiced in more
40 than 24 consecutive months to take the same examination to test competency as that given to
41 applicants for a license. (NRS 630.257) Section 22 of this bill revises this provision to apply
42 to inactive licensees and applicants for a license who have not actively practiced in more than
43 24 consecutive months. Section 22 also authorizes the Board to require such a person to
44 demonstrate his or her competency in a manner other than by taking an examination. Sections
45 16, 28, 36, 40 and 41 of this bill make conforming changes to add references to those
46 requirements where appropriate.
47 Existing law provides for the issuance of various special licenses to practice medicine.
48 (NRS 630.258-630.266) Section 23 removes the requirement that the Board automatically
49 issue a special volunteer license, which authorizes certain retired physicians to continue
50 practicing on a volunteer basis, to a person who possesses the required qualifications for such
51 a license. Section 24 of this bill eliminates the specific statutory requirements for licensure
52 from which a person applying for licensure as an administrative physician is exempt and
53 instead requires the Board to adopt regulations prescribing the requirements from which such
54 an applicant is exempt. Section 25 of this bill eliminates a special license that allows a
55 licensed physician of another state to come into this State to care for a specific patient in
56 association with a physician licensed in this State. Sections 1 and 25 of this bill revise the
57 name of a special purpose license, which allows an out-of-state physician to provide certain
58 medical services to patients in this State electronically, telephonically or by fiber optics, to
59 instead be called a telemedicine license.
60 Existing law establishes fees for the issuance and renewal of a license as a physician
61 assistant or anesthesiologist assistant who is simultaneously licensed by the Board of Medical
62 Examiners and the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine that are one-half of the amount of the
63 standard fees for the issuance and renewal of such a license, meaning that such a person is
64 required to pay one-half of the standard licensure fees to each of those boards. (NRS 630.268,
65 633.501) If a person who pays such a reduced fee to one of those boards fails to also pay the
66 required fee to the other board within 12 months, sections 29, 31-33, 38, 42 and 76-81 of this
67 bill require the person to pay to the board to whom the person has paid a fee the difference
68 between the reduced fee and the standard fee. Sections 12, 13 and 73-75 of this bill require
69 the Board of Medical Examiners and the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine to share
70 information as necessary to enforce that requirement. Section 30 eliminates certain fees
71 charged by the Board of Medical Examiners.
72 Section 10 of this bill exempts certain students who engage in the supervised practice of
73 perfusion from the requirement to be licensed by the Board of Medical Examiners. Sections
Assembly Amendment No. 248 to Assembly Bill No. 319 Page 5
74 34-37 and 84 of this bill remove a requirement that an applicant for a license as a perfusionist
75 pass an examination given by the American Board of Cardiovascular Perfusion, or its
76 successor organization, and instead require such an applicant to be certified by that
77 organization. Section 39 of this bill eliminates a provision prohibiting the Board from
78 requiring a physician assistant to be certified by a nationally recognized organization for the
79 accreditation of physician assistants to satisfy applicable continuing education requirements.
80 Sections 40 and 41 revise the conditions under which the Board may deny an application for
81 licensure by endorsement as a physician assistant. Section 43 of this bill eliminates certain
82 educational qualifications for licensure as a practitioner of respiratory care.
83 Sections 44 and 45 of this bill clarify certain grounds for discipline against a licensee of
84 the Board. Section 45 also authorizes the Board to discipline a licensee who fails to cooperate
85 with an investigation of the Board. Sections 46-49, 52 and 62 of this bill revise certain
86 provisions regarding the provision to the Board of information relating to certain licensees, the
87 examination to determine the fitness of certain licensees and the removal of limitations or
88 suspensions of licenses to be applicable to all licensees of the Board. Section 46 provides that
89 certain reports filed by an insurer relating to malpractice actions are public records. Section
90 51 of this bill provides that the Board is not required to review a complaint that is not within
91 the jurisdiction of the Board.
92 Existing law refers to the document that the Board files to initiate a formal disciplinary
93 proceeding as a formal complaint. (NRS 630.311) However, existing law regarding the
94 procedure of licensing boards generally refers to such a document as a charging document.
95 (NRS 622A.300) Sections 3, 50, 51, 54, 56, 57 and 59 of this bill standardize terminology so
96 that such a document is referred to as a charging document. Section 50 also requires that a
97 charging document for charges against a physician assistant, anesthesiologist assistant,
98 perfusionist or practitioner of respiratory care be filed by the Board.
99 Section 57 removes a requirement that the Board hold a hearing on a report from the
100 Attorney General that a licensee has violated certain laws prohibiting industrial insurance
101 fraud. Section 49 instead requires the Board to treat such a report like a complaint, meaning
102 that the Board would conduct an initial investigation before deciding whether to proceed with
103 disciplinary proceedings. (NRS 630.311)
104 In certain circumstances that create doubt about the fitness of a physician, physician
105 assistant, practitioner of respiratory care or perfusionist to practice, existing law authorizes the
106 Board to require such a licensee to undergo certain examinations to determine his or her
107 fitness to practice. (NRS 630.318) Section 52: (1) makes this provision additionally applicable
108 to anesthesiologist assistants; and (2) provides that the failure to submit to such an
109 examination is grounds for the summary suspension of a license pending further disciplinary
110 proceedings.
111 Existing law authorizes the Board to summarily suspend a license pending further
112 disciplinary proceedings if the Board determines that the health, safety or welfare of the
113 public or any patient is at risk of imminent or continued harm. (NRS 630.326) Section 54: (1)
114 additionally authorizes the Board to restrict the practice of a licensee without suspending his
115 or her license under such circumstances; and (2) removes a requirement that the Board hold a
116 hearing on the summary suspension of a license within 60 days after the summary suspension.
117 Sections 55 and 61 of this bill authorize a court to stay an order of the Board suspending a
118 license if the suspension is not a summary suspension. Section 55 also prohibits a court from
119 staying an order of the Board summarily restricting the practice of a licensee. Section 84
120 eliminates a duplicative provision authorizing the summary suspension of a licensee’s
121 authority to prescribe and dispense controlled substances for certain violations related to such
122 prescribing and dispensing, and section 53 of this bill eliminates a reference to that provision.
123 Section 56: (1) makes revisions relating to collaboration between the Board and other
124 governmental entities investigating a person; and (2) authorizes the Board, with authorization
125 from a licensee, to cooperate with the employer of a licensee or any other person or entity
126 responsible for credentialing a licensee. Section 57 removes certain procedural requirements
127 governing hearings conducted by the Board. Section 58 of this bill revises requirements
128 governing service of process in proceedings before the Board. Section 59 removes a
129 requirement that the Board allow a complainant to participate in disciplinary proceedings.
130 Section 60 of this bill removes the ability for any person other than the respondent or a
131 witness to be held in contempt for certain conduct in a disciplinary proceeding. Section 62
Assembly Amendment No. 248 to Assembly Bill No. 319 Page 6
132 removes authorization for a person whose license has been revoked by the Board to reinstate
133 his or her license without applying for a new license.
134 Existing law prohibits the Board from investigating or disciplining a physician for: (1)
135 disclosing to a governmental entity a violation of any law, rule or regulation by an applicant
136 for a license to practice medicine or a physician; or (2) cooperating with a governmental entity
137 that is conducting an investigation, hearing or inquiry into such a violation. (NRS 630.364)
138 Section 63 of this bill: (1) makes this provision applicable to all licensees of the Board; and
139 (2) requires the disclosure or cooperation to be in good faith for the immunity from
140 investigation or discipline to apply.
141 Existing law prohibits a physician from administering or supervising the administration of
142 general anesthesia, moderate sedation or deep sedation: (1) in an office or facility that does
143 not hold certain permits; or (2) outside of this State. (NRS 630.373) Section 65 of this bill
144 makes this prohibition also applicable to: (1) physician assistants and anesthesiologist
145 assistants; and (2) administering or supervising the administration of tumescent anesthesia,
146 except where authorized by regulation of the Board. Sections 7, 68 and 72 of this bill require
147 a physician, physician assistant, advanced practice registered nurse or osteopathic physician
148 who performs a physical examination of a person who is [19] at least 12 years of age [or
149 younger] but not more than 18 years of age to screen the person for certain health
150 conditions.
151 Existing law authorizes: (1) an unlicensed medical assistant to perform clinical tasks
152 under the supervision of a physician, osteopathic physician or physician assistant in
153 accordance with regulations adopted by the Board of Medical Examiners or the State Board of
154 Osteopathic Medicine, as appropriate; and (2) those boards to discipline a physician,
155 osteopathic physician or physician assistant who fails to adequately supervise a medical
156 assistant. (NRS 630.0129, 630.138, 630.306, 633.075, 633.293, 633.511) Sections 67, 70 and
157 71 of this bill similarly authorize: (1) an unlicensed medical assistant to perform clinical tasks
158 under the supervision of a registered nurse in accordance with regulations of the State Board
159 of Nursing; and (2) the State Board of Nursing to discipline a registered nurse who fails to
160 adequately supervise a medical assistant. Section 69 of this bill establishes the applicability of
161 the definition of “medical assistant” set forth in section 67.

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of physicians, physician assistants,
2 anesthesiologist assistants, practitioners of respiratory care and perfusionists by the Board of
3 Medical Examiners. (Chapter 630 of NRS) Sections 11 and 14 of this bill revise provisions
4 governing examinations that are necessary for licensure as a physician. Section 14 also
5 increases the amount of the fine that the Board may impose on an applicant for a license as a
6 physician who submits false information in connection with the application.
7 Section 21 of this bill requires each licensee of the Board to maintain a permanent
8 electronic mail address for communication with the Board.
9 Existing law prescribes separate qualifications for licensure for: (1) persons who received
10 their medical education in the United States or Canada; and (2) persons who received their
11 medical education in other foreign countries. (NRS 630.160, 630.170, 630.195, 630.263,
12 630.264, 630.265) Existing law also requires a physician to have completed certain
13 residencies in ophthalmology in the United States or Canada in order to perform laser surgery
14 or intense pulsed light therapy on the globe of the eye. (NRS 630.371) Sections 4, 5, 8, 14, 19,

Assembly Amendment No. 248 to Assembly Bill No. 319 Page 4
15 26-28 and 64 of this bill make various changes so that persons who received their medical
16 education in the United Kingdom, Australia or New Zealand, and other foreign countries
17 whose standards for medical education are determined to be equivalent by the Board, are
18 treated identically to persons who received their medical education in the United States or
19 Canada for those purposes.
20 Existing law requires: (1) an applicant for a license to practice medicine to hold certain
21 certifications or have completed or be enrolled in certain progressive postgraduate education;
22 and (2) a physician who performs certain procedures on the eye to have completed certain
23 progressive postgraduate education in ophthalmology. (NRS 630.160, 630.371) Section 6 of
24 this bill prescribes the manner in which the Board must determine whether postgraduate
25 education is progressive for those purposes. Section 14 revises the amount of progressive
26 postgraduate education that a resident physician must have completed in order to be eligible
27 for a license.
28 Existing law authorizes a practitioner of respiratory care to perform certain laboratory
29 tests without obtaining certification as an assistant in a medical laboratory. (NRS 652.210)
30 Sections 9 and 82 of this bill authorize a practitioner of respiratory care to perform certain
31 moderate complexity tests without obtaining such certification if: (1) the practitioner of
32 respiratory care has been trained to perform the test; and (2) the test is within the scope of
33 practice of a practitioner of respiratory care.
34 Sections 15, 16 and 84 of this bill revise and simplify provisions governing licensure by
35 endorsement as a physician by: (1) eliminating expedited licensure by endorsement, except for
36 certain persons affiliated with the Armed Forces of the United States; and (2) making certain
37 revisions relating to the qualifications for licensure by endorsement. Sections 17, 18, 20, 23
38 and 30 of this bill eliminate references to a section repealed by section 84.
39 Existing law authorizes the Board to require a licensee who has not practiced in more
40 than 24 consecutive months to take the same examination to test competency as that given to
41 applicants for a license. (NRS 630.257) Section 22 of this bill revises this provision to apply
42 to inactive licensees and applicants for a license who have not actively practiced in more than
43 24 consecutive months. Section 22 also authorizes the Board to require such a person to
44 demonstrate his or her competency in a manner other than by taking an examination. Sections
45 16, 28, 36, 40 and 41 of this bill make conforming changes to add references to those
46 requirements where appropriate.
47 Existing law provides for the issuance of various special licenses to practice medicine.
48 (NRS 630.258-630.266) Section 23 removes the requirement that the Board automatically
49 issue a special volunteer license, which authorizes certain retired physicians to continue
50 practicing on a volunteer basis, to a person who possesses the required qualifications for such
51 a license. Section 24 of this bill eliminates the specific statutory requirements for licensure
52 from which a person applying for licensure as an administrative physician is exempt and
53 instead requires the Board to adopt regulations prescribing the requirements from which such
54 an applicant is exempt. Section 25 of this bill eliminates a special license that allows a
55 licensed physician of another state to come into this State to care for a specific patient in
56 association with a physician licensed in this State. Sections 1 and 25 of this bill revise the
57 name of a special purpose license, which allows an out-of-state physician to provide certain
58 medical services to patients in this State electronically, telephonically or by fiber optics, to
59 instead be called a telemedicine license.
60 Existing law establishes fees for the issuance and renewal of a license as a physician
61 assistant or anesthesiologist assistant who is simultaneously licensed by the Board of Medical
62 Examiners and the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine that are one-half of the amount of the
63 standard fees for the issuance and renewal of such a license, meaning that such a person is
64 required to pay one-half of the standard licensure fees to each of those boards. (NRS 630.268,
65 633.501) If a person who pays such a reduced fee to one of those boards fails to also pay the
66 required fee to the other board within 12 months, sections 29, 31-33, 38, 42 and 76-81 of this
67 bill require the person to pay to the board to whom the person has paid a fee the difference
68 between the reduced fee and the standard fee. Sections 12, 13 and 73-75 of this bill require
69 the Board of Medical Examiners and the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine to share
70 information as necessary to enforce that requirement. Section 30 eliminates certain fees
71 charged by the Board of Medical Examiners.
72 Section 10 of this bill exempts certain students who engage in the supervised practice of
73 perfusion from the requirement to be licensed by the Board of Medical Examiners. Sections

Assembly Amendment No. 248 to Assembly Bill No. 319 Page 5
74 34-37 and 84 of this bill remove a requirement that an applicant for a license as a perfusionist
75 pass an examination given by the American Board of Cardiovascular Perfusion, or its
76 successor organization, and instead require such an applicant to be certified by that
77 organization. Section 39 of this bill eliminates a provision prohibiting the Board from
78 requiring a physician assistant to be certified by a nationally recognized organization for the
79 accreditation of physician assistants to satisfy applicable continuing education requirements.
80 Sections 40 and 41 revise the conditions under which the Board may deny an application for
81 licensure by endorsement as a physician assistant. Section 43 of this bill eliminates certain
82 educational qualifications for licensure as a practitioner of respiratory care.
83 Sections 44 and 45 of this bill clarify certain grounds for discipline against a licensee of
84 the Board. Section 45 also authorizes the Board to discipline a licensee who fails to cooperate
85 with an investigation of the Board. Sections 46-49, 52 and 62 of this bill revise certain
86 provisions regarding the provision to the Board of information relating to certain licensees, the
87 examination to determine the fitness of certain licensees and the removal of limitations or
88 suspensions of licenses to be applicable to all licensees of the Board. Section 46 provides that
89 certain reports filed by an insurer relating to malpractice actions are public records. Section
90 51 of this bill provides that the Board is not required to review a complaint that is not within
91 the jurisdiction of the Board.
92 Existing law refers to the document that the Board files to initiate a formal disciplinary
93 proceeding as a formal complaint. (NRS 630.311) However, existing law regarding the
94 procedure of licensing boards generally refers to such a document as a charging document.
95 (NRS 622A.300) Sections 3, 50, 51, 54, 56, 57 and 59 of this bill standardize terminology so
96 that such a document is referred to as a charging document. Section 50 also requires that a
97 charging document for charges against a physician assistant, anesthesiologist assistant,
98 perfusionist or practitioner of respiratory care be filed by the Board.
99 Section 57 removes a requirement that the Board hold a hearing on a report from the
100 Attorney General that a licensee has violated certain laws prohibiting industrial insurance
101 fraud. Section 49 instead requires the Board to treat such a report like a complaint, meaning
102 that the Board would conduct an initial investigation before deciding whether to proceed with
103 disciplinary proceedings. (NRS 630.311)
104 In certain circumstances that create doubt about the fitness of a physician, physician
105 assistant, practitioner of respiratory care or perfusionist to practice, existing law authorizes the
106 Board to require such a licensee to undergo certain examinations to determine his or her
107 fitness to practice. (NRS 630.318) Section 52: (1) makes this provision additionally applicable
108 to anesthesiologist assistants; and (2) provides that the failure to submit to such an
109 examination is grounds for the summary suspension of a license pending further disciplinary
110 proceedings.
111 Existing law authorizes the Board to summarily suspend a license pending further
112 disciplinary proceedings if the Board determines that the health, safety or welfare of the
113 public or any patient is at risk of imminent or continued harm. (NRS 630.326) Section 54: (1)
114 additionally authorizes the Board to restrict the practice of a licensee without suspending his
115 or her license under such circumstances; and (2) removes a requirement that the Board hold a
116 hearing on the summary suspension of a license within 60 days after the summary suspension.
117 Sections 55 and 61 of this bill authorize a court to stay an order of the Board suspending a
118 license if the suspension is not a summary suspension. Section 55 also prohibits a court from
119 staying an order of the Board summarily restricting the practice of a licensee. Section 84
120 eliminates a duplicative provision authorizing the summary suspension of a licensee’s
121 authority to prescribe and dispense controlled substances for certain violations related to such
122 prescribing and dispensing, and section 53 of this bill eliminates a reference to that provision.
123 Section 56: (1) makes revisions relating to collaboration between the Board and other
124 governmental entities investigating a person; and (2) authorizes the Board, with authorization
125 from a licensee, to cooperate with the employer of a licensee or any other person or entity
126 responsible for credentialing a licensee. Section 57 removes certain procedural requirements
127 governing hearings conducted by the Board. Section 58 of this bill revises requirements
128 governing service of process in proceedings before the Board. Section 59 removes a
129 requirement that the Board allow a complainant to participate in disciplinary proceedings.
130 Section 60 of this bill removes the ability for any person other than the respondent or a
131 witness to be held in contempt for certain conduct in a disciplinary proceeding. Section 62

Assembly Amendment No. 248 to Assembly Bill No. 319 Page 6
132 removes authorization for a person whose license has been revoked by the Board to reinstate
133 his or her license without applying for a new license.
134 Existing law prohibits the Board from investigating or disciplining a physician for: (1)
135 disclosing to a governmental entity a violation of any law, rule or regulation by an applicant
136 for a license to practice medicine or a physician; or (2) cooperating with a governmental entity
137 that is conducting an investigation, hearing or inquiry into such a violation. (NRS 630.364)
138 Section 63 of this bill: (1) makes this provision applicable to all licensees of the Board; and
139 (2) requires the disclosure or cooperation to be in good faith for the immunity from
140 investigation or discipline to apply.
141 Existing law prohibits a physician from administering or supervising the administration of
142 general anesthesia, moderate sedation or deep sedation: (1) in an office or facility that does
143 not hold certain permits; or (2) outside of this State. (NRS 630.373) Section 65 of this bill
144 makes this prohibition also applicable to: (1) physician assistants and anesthesiologist
145 assistants; and (2) administering or supervising the administration of tumescent anesthesia,
146 except where authorized by regulation of the Board. Sections 7, 68 and 72 of this bill require
147 a physician, physician assistant, advanced practice registered nurse or osteopathic physician
148 who performs a physical examination of a person who is [19] at least 12 years of age [or
149 younger] but not more than 18 years of age to screen the person for certain health
150 conditions.
151 Existing law authorizes: (1) an unlicensed medical assistant to perform clinical tasks
152 under the supervision of a physician, osteopathic physician or physician assistant in
153 accordance with regulations adopted by the Board of Medical Examiners or the State Board of
154 Osteopathic Medicine, as appropriate; and (2) those boards to discipline a physician,
155 osteopathic physician or physician assistant who fails to adequately supervise a medical
156 assistant. (NRS 630.0129, 630.138, 630.306, 633.075, 633.293, 633.511) Sections 67, 70 and
157 71 of this bill similarly authorize: (1) an unlicensed medical assistant to perform clinical tasks
158 under the supervision of a registered nurse in accordance with regulations of the State Board
159 of Nursing; and (2) the State Board of Nursing to discipline a registered nurse who fails to
160 adequately supervise a medical assistant. Section 69 of this bill establishes the applicability of
161 the definition of “medical assistant” set forth in section 67.
