CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to professions; providing for the licensure of
speech-language pathology assistants; authorizing certain
persons to engage in the supervised practice of speech-
language pathology; revising the scope of practice of
audiologists, hearing aid specialists and speech-language
pathologists; requiring certain persons to be licensed and
regulated as audiologists or speech-language pathologists;
increasing the maximum amount of certain fees; authorizing
the Speech-Language Pathology, Audiology and Hearing Aid
Dispensing Board to waive fees in certain circumstances;
requiring that certain fees be discounted for certain persons
affiliated with the military; revising the required
qualifications for and processes for issuing certain licenses;
eliminating the requirement for a licensed audiologist to
obtain an endorsement before engaging in the practice of
fitting and dispensing hearing aids; revising provisions
relating to the sale of hearing aids; imposing certain
requirements relating to the classification of persons who
practice speech-language pathology in schools under a
collective bargaining agreement; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law: (1) with certain exceptions, requires a person who engages in the
practice of audiology, fitting and dispensing hearing aids or speech-language
pathology to be licensed by the Speech-Language Pathology, Audiology and
Hearing Aid Dispensing Board; and (2) prescribes the qualifications necessary to
obtain such licenses. (NRS 637B.160, 637B.193-637B.204, 637B.290) Section 22
of this bill increases the maximum amount of certain fees relating to such licensure.

Section 2:
Section 22 authorizes the Board to waive all or part of such fees in certain
circumstances. Section 22 also requires the Board to collect not more than half of
the fee that would otherwise be required for the initial licensure of an applicant
who: (1) is an active member of the Armed Forces of the United States or a spouse
of such a person; (2) a veteran or the surviving spouse of a veteran; or (3) a family
member of a person killed in the line of duty in the Armed Forces of the United
States under certain circumstances. Sections 27-29 of this bill authorize an
applicant for certain types of licenses which require the applicant to hold a license
in another state to satisfy this requirement by holding the required license in the
District of Columbia or any state or territory of the United States. Section 30 of this
bill revises the procedures for issuing an expedited license by endorsement to
practice audiology or speech-language pathology. Existing law authorizes the
Board to issue a provisional license to practice audiology or speech-language
pathology to certain applicants affiliated with the military who are awaiting a
decision by the Board on an application for an expedited license by endorsement.
(NRS 637B.204) Section 39 of this bill repeals that authority, thereby making the
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 2 –
procedures for issuing an expedited license by endorsement under section 30
applicable to all applicants for such a license. Sections 21 and 22 of this bill
remove references to the repealed section.

Section 3:
Section 16 of this bill expands the activities that constitute the practice of
speech-language pathology to include the use of stroboscopy, in addition to nasal
endoscopy, for evaluating and treating certain disorders. Section 16 also revises
terminology used to refer to certain procedures that currently constitute the practice
of speech-language pathology.
Existing law authorizes a student who is pursuing a degree in speech-language
pathology at certain institutions to engage in the unlicensed practice of speech-
language pathology. (NRS 637B.080) Existing law authorizes the Board to issue a
provisional license to engage in the practice of speech-language pathology to a
person in the process of completing certain clinical fellowship requirements. (NRS
637B.201) Section 3 of this bill defines the term “speech-language pathology
provisional licensee” to refer to the holder of such a provisional license. Section 26
of this bill makes a conforming change to appropriately substitute the term defined
by section 3. Section 9 of this bill authorizes the Board to issue a license as a
speech-language pathology assistant and prescribes the qualifications for such a
license. Section 9 also requires the Board to adopt regulations governing the
licensure and practice of speech-language pathology assistants. Section 10 of this
bill authorizes a speech-language pathology assistant, a speech-language pathology
provisional licensee or a speech-language pathology student to engage in the
practice of speech-language pathology only under the supervision of a supervising
speech-language pathologist. Section 18 of this bill makes a conforming change to
reflect that a student engaged in the supervised practice of speech-language
pathology is subject to regulation by the Board pursuant to section 10. Sections 35-
38 of this bill make conforming changes to clarify that a student who is engaging in
the supervised practice of speech-language pathology pursuant to section 10 is not
engaging in the unauthorized practice of speech-language pathology. Sections 2
and 4-7 of this bill define certain other terms relating to the supervised practice of
speech-language pathology and section 12 of this bill establishes the applicability
of those definitions.
Existing law exempts from licensure and regulation by the Board a person who
practices audiology or speech-language pathology within the scope of certain
credentials issued by the Department of Education. (NRS 637B.080) Section 18
limits the applicability of this exemption to a person who holds a current
endorsement that is issued by the Department on or before September 30, 2026.

Section 4:
Section 9 provides that a person is qualified for licensure as a speech-language
pathology assistant if the person: (1) holds an endorsement issued by the
Department on or before September 30, 2026, which allows the person to teach
pupils with speech and language impairments; and (2) actively practices speech-
language pathology within the scope of that endorsement at the school or school
district where the person is employed. Section 38.3 of this bill requires that a
person who holds such an endorsement, is employed by a school district and is
subject to a collective bargaining agreement be classified in the same manner for
purposes of the agreement as a licensed speech-language pathologist.

Section 5:
Sections 24, 25 and 28 of this bill revise the qualifications required to obtain a
license as a hearing aid specialist, a license as an apprentice to engage in the
practice of fitting and dispensing hearing aids or a provisional license to engage in
the practice of fitting and dispensing hearing aids.
Existing law authorizes the Board to grant an audiologist who wishes to engage
in the practice of fitting and dispensing hearing aids an endorsement to engage in
such practice as a dispensing audiologist. (NRS 637B.205) Section 14 of this bill
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 3 –
includes within the practice of audiology certain activities that substantially overlap
with the practice of fitting and dispensing hearing aids, including ordering the use
of hearing aids. Section 15 of this bill expands the activities that constitute the
practice of fitting and dispensing hearing aids to include ordering the use of hearing
aids. Accordingly, section 39 repeals the separate endorsement for dispensing
audiologists and sections 17, 19, 20, 22, 23, 25, 27 and 31-33 of this bill make
conforming changes to eliminate references to such endorsements and to dispensing
audiologists.
Federal law requires the United States Food and Drug Administration to
regulate over-the-counter hearing aids. (FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 Pub. L.
No. 115-52, § 709, 131 Stat. 1005, 1065–67) Federal law and regulations prohibit
state or local governments from requiring the order, involvement or intervention of
a licensed person for a consumer to access an over-the-counter hearing aid. (Pub. L.
No. 115-52, § 709; 21 C.F.R. § 800.30) Sections 13 and 34 of this bill prohibit the
Board from regulating or restricting the provision of over-the-counter hearing aids
unless a licensee violates federal law applicable to such devices. Section 34 also
updates certain references to related federal regulations.
In 2022, the federal Food and Drug Administration repealed a regulation that
prohibited the sale of a hearing aid unless: (1) the person dispensing the hearing aid
has received a written statement or waiver stating that the patient’s hearing loss has
been medically evaluated and the patient may be considered a candidate for a
hearing aid; or (2) the patient waives the medical evaluation in writing. (87 FR
50755) Section 32 removes conforming requirements from Nevada law governing
the sale of hearing aids by catalog, mail or the Internet, thereby authorizing such
sales without such a statement or waiver.

Raw Text:
Assembly Bill No. 177–Assemblymembers
González; and Brown-May
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to professions; providing for the licensure of
speech-language pathology assistants; authorizing certain
persons to engage in the supervised practice of speech-
language pathology; revising the scope of practice of
audiologists, hearing aid specialists and speech-language
pathologists; requiring certain persons to be licensed and
regulated as audiologists or speech-language pathologists;
increasing the maximum amount of certain fees; authorizing
the Speech-Language Pathology, Audiology and Hearing Aid
Dispensing Board to waive fees in certain circumstances;
requiring that certain fees be discounted for certain persons
affiliated with the military; revising the required
qualifications for and processes for issuing certain licenses;
eliminating the requirement for a licensed audiologist to
obtain an endorsement before engaging in the practice of
fitting and dispensing hearing aids; revising provisions
relating to the sale of hearing aids; imposing certain
requirements relating to the classification of persons who
practice speech-language pathology in schools under a
collective bargaining agreement; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law: (1) with certain exceptions, requires a person who engages in the
practice of audiology, fitting and dispensing hearing aids or speech-language
pathology to be licensed by the Speech-Language Pathology, Audiology and
Hearing Aid Dispensing Board; and (2) prescribes the qualifications necessary to
obtain such licenses. (NRS 637B.160, 637B.193-637B.204, 637B.290) Section 22
of this bill increases the maximum amount of certain fees relating to such licensure.
Section 22 authorizes the Board to waive all or part of such fees in certain
circumstances. Section 22 also requires the Board to collect not more than half of
the fee that would otherwise be required for the initial licensure of an applicant
who: (1) is an active member of the Armed Forces of the United States or a spouse
of such a person; (2) a veteran or the surviving spouse of a veteran; or (3) a family
member of a person killed in the line of duty in the Armed Forces of the United
States under certain circumstances. Sections 27-29 of this bill authorize an
applicant for certain types of licenses which require the applicant to hold a license
in another state to satisfy this requirement by holding the required license in the
District of Columbia or any state or territory of the United States. Section 30 of this
bill revises the procedures for issuing an expedited license by endorsement to
practice audiology or speech-language pathology. Existing law authorizes the
Board to issue a provisional license to practice audiology or speech-language
pathology to certain applicants affiliated with the military who are awaiting a
decision by the Board on an application for an expedited license by endorsement.
(NRS 637B.204) Section 39 of this bill repeals that authority, thereby making the
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 2 –
procedures for issuing an expedited license by endorsement under section 30
applicable to all applicants for such a license. Sections 21 and 22 of this bill
remove references to the repealed section.
Section 16 of this bill expands the activities that constitute the practice of
speech-language pathology to include the use of stroboscopy, in addition to nasal
endoscopy, for evaluating and treating certain disorders. Section 16 also revises
terminology used to refer to certain procedures that currently constitute the practice
of speech-language pathology.
Existing law authorizes a student who is pursuing a degree in speech-language
pathology at certain institutions to engage in the unlicensed practice of speech-
language pathology. (NRS 637B.080) Existing law authorizes the Board to issue a
provisional license to engage in the practice of speech-language pathology to a
person in the process of completing certain clinical fellowship requirements. (NRS
637B.201) Section 3 of this bill defines the term “speech-language pathology
provisional licensee” to refer to the holder of such a provisional license. Section 26
of this bill makes a conforming change to appropriately substitute the term defined
by section 3. Section 9 of this bill authorizes the Board to issue a license as a
speech-language pathology assistant and prescribes the qualifications for such a
license. Section 9 also requires the Board to adopt regulations governing the
licensure and practice of speech-language pathology assistants. Section 10 of this
bill authorizes a speech-language pathology assistant, a speech-language pathology
provisional licensee or a speech-language pathology student to engage in the
practice of speech-language pathology only under the supervision of a supervising
speech-language pathologist. Section 18 of this bill makes a conforming change to
reflect that a student engaged in the supervised practice of speech-language
pathology is subject to regulation by the Board pursuant to section 10. Sections 35-
38 of this bill make conforming changes to clarify that a student who is engaging in
the supervised practice of speech-language pathology pursuant to section 10 is not
engaging in the unauthorized practice of speech-language pathology. Sections 2
and 4-7 of this bill define certain other terms relating to the supervised practice of
speech-language pathology and section 12 of this bill establishes the applicability
of those definitions.
Existing law exempts from licensure and regulation by the Board a person who
practices audiology or speech-language pathology within the scope of certain
credentials issued by the Department of Education. (NRS 637B.080) Section 18
limits the applicability of this exemption to a person who holds a current
endorsement that is issued by the Department on or before September 30, 2026.
Section 9 provides that a person is qualified for licensure as a speech-language
pathology assistant if the person: (1) holds an endorsement issued by the
Department on or before September 30, 2026, which allows the person to teach
pupils with speech and language impairments; and (2) actively practices speech-
language pathology within the scope of that endorsement at the school or school
district where the person is employed. Section 38.3 of this bill requires that a
person who holds such an endorsement, is employed by a school district and is
subject to a collective bargaining agreement be classified in the same manner for
purposes of the agreement as a licensed speech-language pathologist.
Sections 24, 25 and 28 of this bill revise the qualifications required to obtain a
license as a hearing aid specialist, a license as an apprentice to engage in the
practice of fitting and dispensing hearing aids or a provisional license to engage in
the practice of fitting and dispensing hearing aids.
Existing law authorizes the Board to grant an audiologist who wishes to engage
in the practice of fitting and dispensing hearing aids an endorsement to engage in
such practice as a dispensing audiologist. (NRS 637B.205) Section 14 of this bill
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 3 –
includes within the practice of audiology certain activities that substantially overlap
with the practice of fitting and dispensing hearing aids, including ordering the use
of hearing aids. Section 15 of this bill expands the activities that constitute the
practice of fitting and dispensing hearing aids to include ordering the use of hearing
aids. Accordingly, section 39 repeals the separate endorsement for dispensing
audiologists and sections 17, 19, 20, 22, 23, 25, 27 and 31-33 of this bill make
conforming changes to eliminate references to such endorsements and to dispensing
audiologists.
Federal law requires the United States Food and Drug Administration to
regulate over-the-counter hearing aids. (FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 Pub. L.
No. 115-52, § 709, 131 Stat. 1005, 1065–67) Federal law and regulations prohibit
state or local governments from requiring the order, involvement or intervention of
a licensed person for a consumer to access an over-the-counter hearing aid. (Pub. L.
No. 115-52, § 709; 21 C.F.R. § 800.30) Sections 13 and 34 of this bill prohibit the
Board from regulating or restricting the provision of over-the-counter hearing aids
unless a licensee violates federal law applicable to such devices. Section 34 also
updates certain references to related federal regulations.
In 2022, the federal Food and Drug Administration repealed a regulation that
prohibited the sale of a hearing aid unless: (1) the person dispensing the hearing aid
has received a written statement or waiver stating that the patient’s hearing loss has
been medically evaluated and the patient may be considered a candidate for a
hearing aid; or (2) the patient waives the medical evaluation in writing. (87 FR
50755) Section 32 removes conforming requirements from Nevada law governing
the sale of hearing aids by catalog, mail or the Internet, thereby authorizing such
sales without such a statement or waiver.
