Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law: (1) with certain exceptions, requires a person who engages in the practice of
2 audiology, fitting and dispensing hearing aids or speech-language pathology to be licensed by
3 the Speech-Language Pathology, Audiology and Hearing Aid Dispensing Board; and (2)
4 prescribes the qualifications necessary to obtain such licenses. (NRS 637B.160, 637B.193-
5 637B.204, 637B.290) [Section 15 of this bill expands the activities that constitute the practice
6 of fitting and dispensing hearing aids to include: (1) tinnitus care, when performed by a
7 hearing aid specialist with the qualifications prescribed in section 11 of this bill; and (2) the
8 removal of cerumen in the course of inspecting ears or fitting and maintaining hearing
9 instruments. Section 15 thereby authorizes a hearing aid specialist to engage in those activities
10 under the specified conditions. Section 16 of this bill expands the activities that constitute the

Assembly Amendment No. 155 to Assembly Bill No. 177 Page 4
11 practice of speech-language pathology to include the use of stroboscopy, in addition to nasal
12 endoscopy, for evaluating and treating certain disorders. Section 16 also revises terminology
13 used to refer to certain procedures that currently constitute the practice of speech-language
14 pathology.] Section 22 of this bill increases the maximum amount of certain fees relating to
15 such licensure. Section 22 authorizes the Board to waive all or part of such fees in certain
16 circumstances. Section 22 also requires the Board to collect not more than half of the fee
17 that would otherwise be required for the initial licensure of an applicant who: (1) is an
18 active member of the Armed Forces of the United States or a spouse of such a person; (2)
19 a veteran or the surviving spouse of a veteran; or (3) a family member of a person killed
20 in the line of duty in the Armed Forces of the United States under certain circumstances.
21 Sections 27-29 of this bill authorize an applicant for certain types of licenses which require
22 the applicant to hold a license in another state to satisfy this requirement by holding the
23 required license in the District of Columbia or any state or territory of the United States.
24 Section 30 of this bill revises the procedures for issuing an expedited license by endorsement
25 to practice audiology or speech-language pathology. Existing law authorizes the Board to
26 issue a provisional license to practice audiology or speech-language pathology to certain
27 applicants affiliated with the military who are awaiting a decision by the Board on an
28 application for an expedited license by endorsement. (NRS 637B.204) Section 39 of this bill
29 repeals that authority, thereby making the procedures for issuing an expedited license by
30 endorsement under section 30 applicable to all applicants for such a license. Sections 21 and
31 22 of this bill remove references to the repealed section.
32 Section 16 of this bill expands the activities that constitute the practice of speech-
33 language pathology to include the use of stroboscopy, in addition to nasal endoscopy, for
34 evaluating and treating certain disorders. Section 16 also revises terminology used to
35 refer to certain procedures that currently constitute the practice of speech-language
36 pathology.
37 Existing law authorizes a student who is pursuing a degree in speech-language pathology
38 at certain institutions to engage in the unlicensed practice of speech-language pathology.
39 (NRS 637B.080) Existing law authorizes the Board to issue a provisional license to engage in
40 the practice of speech-language pathology to a person in the process of completing certain
41 clinical fellowship requirements. (NRS 637B.201) Section 3 of this bill defines the term
42 “speech-language pathology provisional licensee” to refer to the holder of such a provisional
43 license. Section 26 of this bill makes a conforming change to appropriately substitute the term
44 defined by section 3. Section 9 of this bill authorizes the Board to issue a license as a speech-
45 language pathology assistant and prescribes the qualifications for such a license. Section 9
46 also requires the Board to adopt regulations governing the licensure and practice of speech-
47 language pathology assistants. Section 10 of this bill authorizes a speech-language pathology
48 assistant, a speech-language pathology provisional licensee or a speech-language pathology
49 student to engage in the practice of speech-language pathology only under the supervision of a
50 supervising speech-language pathologist. Section 18 of this bill makes a conforming change
51 to reflect that a student engaged in the supervised practice of speech-language pathology is
52 subject to regulation by the Board pursuant to section 10. Sections 35-38 of this bill make
53 conforming changes to clarify that a student who is engaging in the supervised practice of
54 speech-language pathology pursuant to section 10 is not engaging in the unauthorized practice
55 of speech-language pathology. Sections 2 and [4-8] 4-7 of this bill define certain other terms
56 relating to the supervised practice of speech-language pathology and section 12 of this bill
57 establishes the applicability of those definitions.
58 Existing law exempts from licensure and regulation by the Board a person who practices
59 audiology or speech-language pathology within the scope of [a credential] certain credentials
60 issued by the Department of Education. (NRS 637B.080) Section 18 [eliminates that
61 exemption, thereby requiring such a person to be subject to licensure and regulation by the
62 Board.] limits the applicability of this exemption to a person who holds a current
63 endorsement that is issued by the Department on or before September 30, 2026. Section
64 9 provides that a person [who] is qualified for licensure as a speech-language pathology
65 assistant if the person: (1) holds [certain credentials] an endorsement issued by the
66 Department on or before September 30, 2026, which [allow] allows the [holder] person to
67 teach pupils with speech and language impairments [is qualified for licensure as a speech-
68 language pathology assistant.] ; and (2) actively practices speech-language pathology
69 within the scope of that endorsement at the school or school district where the person is

Assembly Amendment No. 155 to Assembly Bill No. 177 Page 5
70 employed. Section 38.3 of this bill requires that a person who holds such an
71 endorsement, is employed by a school district and is subject to a collective bargaining
72 agreement be classified in the same manner for purposes of the agreement as a licensed
73 speech-language pathologist.
74 Sections 24, 25 and 28 of this bill revise the qualifications required to obtain a license as
75 a hearing aid specialist, a license as an apprentice to engage in the practice of fitting and
76 dispensing hearing aids or a provisional license to engage in the practice of fitting and
77 dispensing hearing aids.
78 Existing law authorizes the Board to grant an audiologist who wishes to engage in the
79 practice of fitting and dispensing hearing aids an endorsement to engage in such practice as a
80 dispensing audiologist. (NRS 637B.205) Section 14 of this bill includes within the practice of
81 audiology certain activities that substantially overlap with the practice of fitting and
82 dispensing hearing aids, including ordering the use of hearing aids. Section 15 of this bill
83 expands the activities that constitute the practice of fitting and dispensing hearing aids
84 to include ordering the use of hearing aids. Accordingly, section 39 repeals the separate
85 endorsement for dispensing audiologists and sections 17, 19, 20, 22, 23, 25, 27 and 31-33 of
86 this bill make conforming changes to eliminate references to such endorsements and to
87 dispensing audiologists.
88 Federal law requires the United States Food and Drug Administration to regulate over-
89 the-counter hearing aids. (FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 Pub. L. No. 115-52, § 709, 131
90 Stat. 1005, 1065–67) Federal law and regulations prohibit state or local governments from
91 requiring the order, involvement or intervention of a licensed person for a consumer to access
92 an over-the-counter hearing aid. (Pub. L. No. 115-52, § 709; 21 C.F.R. § 800.30) Sections 13
93 and 34 of this bill prohibit the Board from regulating or restricting the provision of over-the-
94 counter hearing aids unless a licensee violates federal law applicable to such devices. Section
95 34 also updates certain references to related federal regulations.
96 In 2022, the federal Food and Drug Administration repealed a regulation that prohibited
97 the sale of a hearing aid unless: (1) the person dispensing the hearing aid has received a
98 written statement or waiver stating that the patient’s hearing loss has been medically evaluated
99 and the patient may be considered a candidate for a hearing aid; or (2) the patient waives the
100 medical evaluation in writing. (87 FR 50755) Section 32 removes conforming requirements
101 from Nevada law governing the sale of hearing aids by catalog, mail or the Internet, thereby
102 authorizing such sales without such a statement or waiver.
