AN ACT relating to professions; providing for the licensure of
speech-language pathology assistants; authorizing certain
persons to engage in the supervised practice of speech-
language pathology; establishing requirements for hearing
aid specialists to provide tinnitus care; revising the scope
of practice of audiologists, hearing aid specialists and
speech-language pathologists; requiring certain persons to
be licensed and regulated as audiologists or speech-
language pathologists; increasing the maximum amount
of certain fees; revising the required qualifications for and
processes for issuing certain licenses; eliminating the
requirement for a licensed audiologist to obtain an
endorsement before engaging in the practice of fitting and
dispensing hearing aids; revising provisions relating to the
sale of hearing aids; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law: (1) with certain exceptions, requires a person who engages in the
2 practice of audiology, fitting and dispensing hearing aids or speech-language
3 pathology to be licensed by the Speech-Language Pathology, Audiology and
4 Hearing Aid Dispensing Board; and (2) prescribes the qualifications necessary to
5 obtain such licenses. (NRS 637B.160, 637B.193-637B.204, 637B.290) Section 15
6 of this bill expands the activities that constitute the practice of fitting and
7 dispensing hearing aids to include: (1) tinnitus care, when performed by a hearing
8 aid specialist with the qualifications prescribed in section 11 of this bill; and (2) the
9 removal of cerumen in the course of inspecting ears or fitting and maintaining
-
*AB177*
– 2 –
10 hearing instruments. Section 15 thereby authorizes a hearing aid specialist to
11 engage in those activities under the specified conditions. Section 16 of this bill
12 expands the activities that constitute the practice of speech-language pathology to
13 include the use of stroboscopy, in addition to nasal endoscopy, for evaluating and
14 treating certain disorders. Section 16 also revises terminology used to refer to
15 certain procedures that currently constitute the practice of speech-language
16 pathology. Section 22 of this bill increases the maximum amount of certain fees
17 relating to such licensure. Sections 27-29 of this bill authorize an applicant for
18 certain types of licenses which require the applicant to hold a license in another
19 state to satisfy this requirement by holding the required license in the District of
20 Columbia or any state or territory of the United States. Section 30 of this bill
21 revises the procedures for issuing an expedited license by endorsement to practice
22 audiology or speech-language pathology. Existing law authorizes the Board to issue
23 a provisional license to practice audiology or speech-language pathology to certain
24 applicants affiliated with the military who are awaiting a decision by the Board on
25 an application for an expedited license by endorsement. (NRS 637B.204) Section
26 39 of this bill repeals that authority, thereby making the procedures for issuing an
27 expedited license by endorsement under section 30 applicable to all applicants for
28 such a license. Sections 21 and 22 of this bill remove references to the repealed
29 section.
30 Existing law authorizes a student who is pursuing a degree in speech-language
31 pathology at certain institutions to engage in the unlicensed practice of speech-
32 language pathology. (NRS 637B.080) Existing law authorizes the Board to issue a
33 provisional license to engage in the practice of speech-language pathology to a
34 person in the process of completing certain clinical fellowship requirements. (NRS
35 637B.201) Section 3 of this bill defines the term “speech-language pathology
36 provisional licensee” to refer to the holder of such a provisional license. Section 26
37 of this bill makes a conforming change to appropriately substitute the term defined
38 by section 3. Section 9 of this bill authorizes the Board to issue a license as a
39 speech-language pathology assistant and prescribes the qualifications for such a
40 license. Section 9 also requires the Board to adopt regulations governing the
41 licensure and practice of speech-language pathology assistants. Section 10 of this
42 bill authorizes a speech-language pathology assistant, a speech-language pathology
43 provisional licensee or a speech-language pathology student to engage in the
44 practice of speech-language pathology only under the supervision of a supervising
45 speech-language pathologist. Section 18 of this bill makes a conforming change to
46 reflect that a student engaged in the supervised practice of speech-language
47 pathology is subject to regulation by the Board pursuant to section 10. Sections 35-
48 38 of this bill make conforming changes to clarify that a student who is engaging in
49 the supervised practice of speech-language pathology pursuant to section 10 is not
50 engaging in the unauthorized practice of speech-language pathology. Sections 2
51 and 4-8 of this bill define certain other terms relating to the supervised practice of
52 speech-language pathology and section 12 of this bill establishes the applicability
53 of those definitions.
54 Existing law exempts from licensure and regulation by the Board a person who
55 practices audiology or speech-language pathology within the scope of a credential
56 issued by the Department of Education. (NRS 637B.080) Section 18 eliminates that
57 exemption, thereby requiring such a person to be subject to licensure and regulation
58 by the Board. Section 9 provides that a person who holds certain credentials issued
59 by the Department on or before September 30, 2026, which allow the holder to
60 teach pupils with speech and language impairments is qualified for licensure as a
61 speech-language pathology assistant.
62 Sections 24, 25 and 28 of this bill revise the qualifications required to obtain a
63 license as a hearing aid specialist, a license as an apprentice to engage in the
-
*AB177*
– 3 –
64 practice of fitting and dispensing hearing aids or a provisional license to engage in
65 the practice of fitting and dispensing hearing aids.
66 Existing law authorizes the Board to grant an audiologist who wishes to engage
67 in the practice of fitting and dispensing hearing aids an endorsement to engage in
68 such practice as a dispensing audiologist. (NRS 637B.205) Section 14 of this bill
69 includes within the practice of audiology certain activities that substantially overlap
70 with the practice of fitting and dispensing hearing aids, including ordering the use
71 of hearing aids. Accordingly, section 39 repeals the separate endorsement for
72 dispensing audiologists and sections 17, 19, 20, 22, 23, 25, 27 and 31-33 of this
73 bill make conforming changes to eliminate references to such endorsements and to
74 dispensing audiologists.
75 Federal law requires the United States Food and Drug Administration to
76 regulate over-the-counter hearing aids. (FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 Pub. L.
77 No. 115-52, § 709, 131 Stat. 1005, 1065–67) Federal law and regulations prohibit
78 state or local governments from requiring the order, involvement or intervention of
79 a licensed person for a consumer to access an over-the-counter hearing aid. (Pub. L.
80 No. 115-52, § 709; 21 C.F.R. § 800.30) Sections 13 and 34 of this bill prohibit the
81 Board from regulating or restricting the provision of over-the-counter hearing aids
82 unless a licensee violates federal law applicable to such devices. Section 34 also
83 updates certain references to related federal regulations.
84 In 2022, the federal Food and Drug Administration repealed a regulation that
85 prohibited the sale of a hearing aid unless: (1) the person dispensing the hearing aid
86 has received a written statement or waiver stating that the patient’s hearing loss has
87 been medically evaluated and the patient may be considered a candidate for a
88 hearing aid; or (2) the patient waives the medical evaluation in writing. (87 FR
89 50755) Section 32 removes conforming requirements from Nevada law governing
90 the sale of hearing aids by catalog, mail or the Internet, thereby authorizing such
91 sales without such a statement or waiver.

A.B. 177
ASSEMBLY BILL NO. 177–ASSEMBLYMEMBER GONZÁLEZ
PREFILED FEBRUARY 2, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Commerce and Labor
SUMMARY—Makes various changes relating to audiology, fitting
and dispensing hearing aids and speech-language
pathology. (BDR 54-199)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to professions; providing for the licensure of
speech-language pathology assistants; authorizing certain
persons to engage in the supervised practice of speech-
language pathology; establishing requirements for hearing
aid specialists to provide tinnitus care; revising the scope
of practice of audiologists, hearing aid specialists and
speech-language pathologists; requiring certain persons to
be licensed and regulated as audiologists or speech-
language pathologists; increasing the maximum amount
of certain fees; revising the required qualifications for and
processes for issuing certain licenses; eliminating the
requirement for a licensed audiologist to obtain an
endorsement before engaging in the practice of fitting and
dispensing hearing aids; revising provisions relating to the
sale of hearing aids; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law: (1) with certain exceptions, requires a person who engages in the
2 practice of audiology, fitting and dispensing hearing aids or speech-language
3 pathology to be licensed by the Speech-Language Pathology, Audiology and
4 Hearing Aid Dispensing Board; and (2) prescribes the qualifications necessary to
5 obtain such licenses. (NRS 637B.160, 637B.193-637B.204, 637B.290) Section 15
6 of this bill expands the activities that constitute the practice of fitting and
7 dispensing hearing aids to include: (1) tinnitus care, when performed by a hearing
8 aid specialist with the qualifications prescribed in section 11 of this bill; and (2) the
9 removal of cerumen in the course of inspecting ears or fitting and maintaining
-
*AB177*

– 2 –
10 hearing instruments. Section 15 thereby authorizes a hearing aid specialist to
11 engage in those activities under the specified conditions. Section 16 of this bill
12 expands the activities that constitute the practice of speech-language pathology to
13 include the use of stroboscopy, in addition to nasal endoscopy, for evaluating and
14 treating certain disorders. Section 16 also revises terminology used to refer to
15 certain procedures that currently constitute the practice of speech-language
16 pathology. Section 22 of this bill increases the maximum amount of certain fees
17 relating to such licensure. Sections 27-29 of this bill authorize an applicant for
18 certain types of licenses which require the applicant to hold a license in another
19 state to satisfy this requirement by holding the required license in the District of
20 Columbia or any state or territory of the United States. Section 30 of this bill
21 revises the procedures for issuing an expedited license by endorsement to practice
22 audiology or speech-language pathology. Existing law authorizes the Board to issue
23 a provisional license to practice audiology or speech-language pathology to certain
24 applicants affiliated with the military who are awaiting a decision by the Board on
25 an application for an expedited license by endorsement. (NRS 637B.204) Section
26 39 of this bill repeals that authority, thereby making the procedures for issuing an
27 expedited license by endorsement under section 30 applicable to all applicants for
28 such a license. Sections 21 and 22 of this bill remove references to the repealed
29 section.
30 Existing law authorizes a student who is pursuing a degree in speech-language
31 pathology at certain institutions to engage in the unlicensed practice of speech-
32 language pathology. (NRS 637B.080) Existing law authorizes the Board to issue a
33 provisional license to engage in the practice of speech-language pathology to a
34 person in the process of completing certain clinical fellowship requirements. (NRS
35 637B.201) Section 3 of this bill defines the term “speech-language pathology
36 provisional licensee” to refer to the holder of such a provisional license. Section 26
37 of this bill makes a conforming change to appropriately substitute the term defined
38 by section 3. Section 9 of this bill authorizes the Board to issue a license as a
39 speech-language pathology assistant and prescribes the qualifications for such a
40 license. Section 9 also requires the Board to adopt regulations governing the
41 licensure and practice of speech-language pathology assistants. Section 10 of this
42 bill authorizes a speech-language pathology assistant, a speech-language pathology
43 provisional licensee or a speech-language pathology student to engage in the
44 practice of speech-language pathology only under the supervision of a supervising
45 speech-language pathologist. Section 18 of this bill makes a conforming change to
46 reflect that a student engaged in the supervised practice of speech-language
47 pathology is subject to regulation by the Board pursuant to section 10. Sections 35-
48 38 of this bill make conforming changes to clarify that a student who is engaging in
49 the supervised practice of speech-language pathology pursuant to section 10 is not
50 engaging in the unauthorized practice of speech-language pathology. Sections 2
51 and 4-8 of this bill define certain other terms relating to the supervised practice of
52 speech-language pathology and section 12 of this bill establishes the applicability
53 of those definitions.
54 Existing law exempts from licensure and regulation by the Board a person who
55 practices audiology or speech-language pathology within the scope of a credential
56 issued by the Department of Education. (NRS 637B.080) Section 18 eliminates that
57 exemption, thereby requiring such a person to be subject to licensure and regulation
58 by the Board. Section 9 provides that a person who holds certain credentials issued
59 by the Department on or before September 30, 2026, which allow the holder to
60 teach pupils with speech and language impairments is qualified for licensure as a
61 speech-language pathology assistant.
62 Sections 24, 25 and 28 of this bill revise the qualifications required to obtain a
63 license as a hearing aid specialist, a license as an apprentice to engage in the
-
*AB177*

– 3 –
64 practice of fitting and dispensing hearing aids or a provisional license to engage in
65 the practice of fitting and dispensing hearing aids.
66 Existing law authorizes the Board to grant an audiologist who wishes to engage
67 in the practice of fitting and dispensing hearing aids an endorsement to engage in
68 such practice as a dispensing audiologist. (NRS 637B.205) Section 14 of this bill
69 includes within the practice of audiology certain activities that substantially overlap
70 with the practice of fitting and dispensing hearing aids, including ordering the use
71 of hearing aids. Accordingly, section 39 repeals the separate endorsement for
72 dispensing audiologists and sections 17, 19, 20, 22, 23, 25, 27 and 31-33 of this
73 bill make conforming changes to eliminate references to such endorsements and to
74 dispensing audiologists.
75 Federal law requires the United States Food and Drug Administration to
76 regulate over-the-counter hearing aids. (FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 Pub. L.
77 No. 115-52, § 709, 131 Stat. 1005, 1065–67) Federal law and regulations prohibit
78 state or local governments from requiring the order, involvement or intervention of
79 a licensed person for a consumer to access an over-the-counter hearing aid. (Pub. L.
80 No. 115-52, § 709; 21 C.F.R. § 800.30) Sections 13 and 34 of this bill prohibit the
81 Board from regulating or restricting the provision of over-the-counter hearing aids
82 unless a licensee violates federal law applicable to such devices. Section 34 also
83 updates certain references to related federal regulations.
84 In 2022, the federal Food and Drug Administration repealed a regulation that
85 prohibited the sale of a hearing aid unless: (1) the person dispensing the hearing aid
86 has received a written statement or waiver stating that the patient’s hearing loss has
87 been medically evaluated and the patient may be considered a candidate for a
88 hearing aid; or (2) the patient waives the medical evaluation in writing. (87 FR
89 50755) Section 32 removes conforming requirements from Nevada law governing
90 the sale of hearing aids by catalog, mail or the Internet, thereby authorizing such
91 sales without such a statement or waiver.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
