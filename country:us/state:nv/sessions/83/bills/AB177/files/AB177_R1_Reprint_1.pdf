Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law: (1) with certain exceptions, requires a person who engages in the
2 practice of audiology, fitting and dispensing hearing aids or speech-language
3 pathology to be licensed by the Speech-Language Pathology, Audiology and
4 Hearing Aid Dispensing Board; and (2) prescribes the qualifications necessary to
5 obtain such licenses. (NRS 637B.160, 637B.193-637B.204, 637B.290) Section 22
6 of this bill increases the maximum amount of certain fees relating to such licensure.
7 Section 22 authorizes the Board to waive all or part of such fees in certain
8 circumstances. Section 22 also requires the Board to collect not more than half of
9 the fee that would otherwise be required for the initial licensure of an applicant
10 who: (1) is an active member of the Armed Forces of the United States or a spouse
11 of such a person; (2) a veteran or the surviving spouse of a veteran; or (3) a family
12 member of a person killed in the line of duty in the Armed Forces of the United
13 States under certain circumstances. Sections 27-29 of this bill authorize an
14 applicant for certain types of licenses which require the applicant to hold a license
15 in another state to satisfy this requirement by holding the required license in the
16 District of Columbia or any state or territory of the United States. Section 30 of this
17 bill revises the procedures for issuing an expedited license by endorsement to
18 practice audiology or speech-language pathology. Existing law authorizes the
19 Board to issue a provisional license to practice audiology or speech-language
20 pathology to certain applicants affiliated with the military who are awaiting a
21 decision by the Board on an application for an expedited license by endorsement.
22 (NRS 637B.204) Section 39 of this bill repeals that authority, thereby making the
23 procedures for issuing an expedited license by endorsement under section 30
24 applicable to all applicants for such a license. Sections 21 and 22 of this bill
25 remove references to the repealed section.
26 Section 16 of this bill expands the activities that constitute the practice of
27 speech-language pathology to include the use of stroboscopy, in addition to nasal
28 endoscopy, for evaluating and treating certain disorders. Section 16 also revises
29 terminology used to refer to certain procedures that currently constitute the practice
30 of speech-language pathology.
31 Existing law authorizes a student who is pursuing a degree in speech-language
32 pathology at certain institutions to engage in the unlicensed practice of speech-
33 language pathology. (NRS 637B.080) Existing law authorizes the Board to issue a
34 provisional license to engage in the practice of speech-language pathology to a
35 person in the process of completing certain clinical fellowship requirements. (NRS
36 637B.201) Section 3 of this bill defines the term “speech-language pathology
37 provisional licensee” to refer to the holder of such a provisional license. Section 26
38 of this bill makes a conforming change to appropriately substitute the term defined
39 by section 3. Section 9 of this bill authorizes the Board to issue a license as a
40 speech-language pathology assistant and prescribes the qualifications for such a
41 license. Section 9 also requires the Board to adopt regulations governing the
42 licensure and practice of speech-language pathology assistants. Section 10 of this
43 bill authorizes a speech-language pathology assistant, a speech-language pathology
44 provisional licensee or a speech-language pathology student to engage in the
45 practice of speech-language pathology only under the supervision of a supervising
46 speech-language pathologist. Section 18 of this bill makes a conforming change to
47 reflect that a student engaged in the supervised practice of speech-language
48 pathology is subject to regulation by the Board pursuant to section 10. Sections 35-
49 38 of this bill make conforming changes to clarify that a student who is engaging in
50 the supervised practice of speech-language pathology pursuant to section 10 is not
51 engaging in the unauthorized practice of speech-language pathology. Sections 2
52 and 4-7 of this bill define certain other terms relating to the supervised practice of
53 speech-language pathology and section 12 of this bill establishes the applicability
54 of those definitions.

55 Existing law exempts from licensure and regulation by the Board a person who
56 practices audiology or speech-language pathology within the scope of certain
57 credentials issued by the Department of Education. (NRS 637B.080) Section 18
58 limits the applicability of this exemption to a person who holds a current
59 endorsement that is issued by the Department on or before September 30, 2026.
60 Section 9 provides that a person is qualified for licensure as a speech-language
61 pathology assistant if the person: (1) holds an endorsement issued by the
62 Department on or before September 30, 2026, which allows the person to teach
63 pupils with speech and language impairments; and (2) actively practices speech-
64 language pathology within the scope of that endorsement at the school or school
65 district where the person is employed. Section 38.3 of this bill requires that a
66 person who holds such an endorsement, is employed by a school district and is
67 subject to a collective bargaining agreement be classified in the same manner for
68 purposes of the agreement as a licensed speech-language pathologist.
69 Sections 24, 25 and 28 of this bill revise the qualifications required to obtain a
70 license as a hearing aid specialist, a license as an apprentice to engage in the
71 practice of fitting and dispensing hearing aids or a provisional license to engage in
72 the practice of fitting and dispensing hearing aids.
73 Existing law authorizes the Board to grant an audiologist who wishes to engage
74 in the practice of fitting and dispensing hearing aids an endorsement to engage in
75 such practice as a dispensing audiologist. (NRS 637B.205) Section 14 of this bill
76 includes within the practice of audiology certain activities that substantially overlap
77 with the practice of fitting and dispensing hearing aids, including ordering the use
78 of hearing aids. Section 15 of this bill expands the activities that constitute the
79 practice of fitting and dispensing hearing aids to include ordering the use of hearing
80 aids. Accordingly, section 39 repeals the separate endorsement for dispensing
81 audiologists and sections 17, 19, 20, 22, 23, 25, 27 and 31-33 of this bill make
82 conforming changes to eliminate references to such endorsements and to dispensing
83 audiologists.
84 Federal law requires the United States Food and Drug Administration to
85 regulate over-the-counter hearing aids. (FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 Pub. L.
86 No. 115-52, § 709, 131 Stat. 1005, 1065–67) Federal law and regulations prohibit
87 state or local governments from requiring the order, involvement or intervention of
88 a licensed person for a consumer to access an over-the-counter hearing aid. (Pub. L.
89 No. 115-52, § 709; 21 C.F.R. § 800.30) Sections 13 and 34 of this bill prohibit the
90 Board from regulating or restricting the provision of over-the-counter hearing aids
91 unless a licensee violates federal law applicable to such devices. Section 34 also
92 updates certain references to related federal regulations.
93 In 2022, the federal Food and Drug Administration repealed a regulation that
94 prohibited the sale of a hearing aid unless: (1) the person dispensing the hearing aid
95 has received a written statement or waiver stating that the patient’s hearing loss has
96 been medically evaluated and the patient may be considered a candidate for a
97 hearing aid; or (2) the patient waives the medical evaluation in writing. (87 FR
98 50755) Section 32 removes conforming requirements from Nevada law governing
99 the sale of hearing aids by catalog, mail or the Internet, thereby authorizing such
100 sales without such a statement or waiver.
