Section 1:
on Commerce and Labor
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to unemployment compensation; eliminating
provisions requiring the Administrator of the Employment
Security Division of the Department of Employment,
Training and Rehabilitation to annually perform certain
calculations to determine certain information relating to the
solvency of the Unemployment Compensation Fund; revising
the amount of certain money that is required to be annually
transferred from the Unemployment Compensation
Administration Fund to the Unemployment Compensation
Fund; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
The Unemployment Compensation Law, in general: (1) requires employers to
pay contributions into the Unemployment Compensation Fund at a certain rate of
the wages paid by the employer for employment; and (2) makes persons who have
become unemployed and comply with certain requirements eligible for benefits
from the Unemployment Compensation Fund in an amount based on the person’s
previous wages for employment. (Chapter 612 of NRS) Section 1 of this bill
eliminates provisions requiring the Administrator of the Employment Security
Division of the Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation, on or
before September 30 of each year, to perform certain calculations to determine
certain information relating to the solvency of the Unemployment Compensation
Fund. (NRS 612.550)
Existing law requires, with certain exceptions, each employer to make
payments, at the rate of .05 percent of the wages the employer pays, into the
Unemployment Compensation Administration Fund. (NRS 612.606) Existing law
requires the money collected from such payments to be used for certain purposes
relating to the employment and training of unemployed persons and persons
employed in this State. (NRS 612.606, 612.607) Under existing law, at the end of
each fiscal year, the State Controller is required to transfer into the Clearing
Account in the Unemployment Compensation Fund the amount by which the
unencumbered balance of the money collected from such payments exceeds the
amount of that money which the Legislature has authorized for expenditure during
the first 90 days of the succeeding fiscal year. (NRS 612.607) Section 2 of this bill
revises the amount of the required transfer to be the amount by which the
unencumbered balance of the money collected from such payments exceeds the
amount of that money which the Legislature has authorized for expenditure during
the first 180 days of the succeeding fiscal year.

Section 4:
2. The Administrator shall, as of the computation date for each
calendar year, classify employers in accordance with their actual
payrolls, contributions and benefit experience, and shall determine
for each employer the rate of contribution which applies to that
employer for each calendar year in order to reflect his or her
experience and classification. The contribution rate of an employer
may not be reduced below 2.95 percent, unless there have been 12
consecutive calendar quarters immediately preceding the
computation date throughout which the employer has been subject
to this chapter and his or her account as an employer could have
been charged with benefit payments, except that an employer who
has not been subject to the law for a sufficient period to meet this
requirement may qualify for a rate less than 2.95 percent if his or
her account has been chargeable throughout a lesser period not less
than the 10-consecutive-calendar-quarter period ending on the
computation date.

Section 5:
3. Any employer who qualifies under paragraph (b) of
subsection [9] 8 and receives the experience record of a predecessor
employer must be assigned the contribution rate of the predecessor.

Section 6:
4. Benefits paid to a person up to and including the
computation date must be charged against the records, for
experience rating, of the person’s base-period employers in the same
percentage relationship that wages reported by individual employers
represent to total wages reported by all base period employers,
except that:
(a) If one of the base period employers has paid 75 percent or
more of the wages paid to the person during the person’s base
period, and except as otherwise provided in NRS 612.551, the
benefits, less a proportion equal to the proportion of wages paid
during the base period by employers who make reimbursement in
lieu of contributions, must be charged to the records for experience
rating of that employer. The proportion of benefits paid which is
equal to the part of the wages of the claimant for the base period
paid by an employer who makes reimbursement must be charged to
the record of that employer.
(b) No benefits paid to a multistate claimant based upon
entitlement to benefits in more than one state may be charged to the
experience rating record of any employer when no benefits would
have been payable except pursuant to NRS 612.295.
(c) Except for employers who have been given the right to make
reimbursement in lieu of contributions, extended benefits paid to a
person must not be charged against the accounts of the person’s
base-period employers.

employer for the calendar year must be determined by the range
within which the employer’s reserve ratio falls. The Administrator
shall, by regulation, prescribe the contribution rate schedule to apply
for each calendar year by designating the ranges of reserve ratios to
which must be assigned the various contribution rates provided in
subsection 6. The lowest contribution rate must be assigned to the
designated range of highest reserve ratios and each succeeding
higher contribution rate must be assigned to each succeeding
designated range of lower reserve ratios, except that, within the
limits possible, the differences between reserve ratio ranges must be
uniform.

Section 8:
6. Each employer eligible for a contribution rate based upon
experience and classified in accordance with this section must be
assigned a contribution rate by the Administrator for each calendar
year according to the following classes:

83rd Session (2025)
– 5 –
(a) The highest of the unemployment risk ratios experienced in
the 109 consecutive 12-month periods in the 10 years ending on
March 31;
(b) The potential annual number of beneficiaries found by
multiplying the highest unemployment risk ratio by the average
monthly number of covered workers in employment as shown on
the records of the Division for the 12 months ending on March 31;
(c) The potential annual number of weeks of benefits payable
found by multiplying the potential number of beneficiaries by the
highest average actual duration experienced in the 109 consecutive
12-month periods in the 10 years ending on September 30; and
(d) The potential maximum annual benefits payable found by
multiplying the potential annual number of weeks of benefits
payable by the average payment made to beneficiaries for weeks of
total unemployment in the 12 months ending on September 30.

Section 10:
8.] The Administrator shall issue an individual statement,
itemizing benefits charged during the 12-month period ending on
the computation date, total benefit charges, total contributions paid,
reserve balance and the rate of contributions to apply for that
calendar year, for each employer whose account is in active status
on the records of the Division on January 1 of each year and whose
account is chargeable with benefit payments on the computation
date of that year.
[9.] 8. If an employer transfers its trade or business, or a
portion thereof, to another employer:
(a) And there is substantially common ownership, management
or control of the employers, the experience record attributable to the
transferred trade or business must be transferred to the employer to
whom the trade or business is transferred. The rates of both
employers must be recalculated, and the recalculated rates become
effective on the date of the transfer of the trade or business. If the
Administrator determines, following the transfer of the experience
record pursuant to this paragraph, that the sole or primary purpose
of the transfer of the trade or business was to obtain a reduced
liability for contributions, the Administrator shall combine the
experience rating records of the employers involved into a single
account and assign a single rate to the account.
(b) And there is no substantially common ownership,
management or control of the employers, the experience record of
an employer may be transferred to a successor employer as of the
effective date of the change of ownership if:

 The joint application must be submitted within 1 year after the
date of issuance by the Division of official notice of eligibility to
transfer.
(c) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (a), a transfer of
the experience record must not be completed if the Administrator
determines that the acquisition was effected solely or primarily to
obtain a more favorable contribution rate.
(d) Any liability to the Division for unpaid contributions,
interest or forfeit attributable to the transferred trade or business
must be transferred to the successor employer. The percentage of
liability transferred must be the same as the percentage of the
experience record transferred.
[10.] 9. Whenever an employer has paid no wages in
employment for 8 consecutive calendar quarters following the last
calendar quarter in which the employer paid wages for employment,
the Administrator shall terminate the employer’s experience rating
account, and the account must not thereafter be used in any rate
computation.
[11.] 10. The Administrator may adopt reasonable accounting
methods to account for those employers which are in a category for
providing reimbursement in lieu of contributions.
[12.] 11. To the extent allowed by federal law, the
Administrator may, by regulation, suspend, modify, amend or waive
any requirement of this section for the duration of a state of
emergency or declaration of disaster proclaimed pursuant to NRS

Section 11:
414.070 and for any additional period of time during which the
emergency or disaster directly affects the requirement of this section
if:
(a) The Administrator determines the action is:

Unemployment Compensation Administration Fund pursuant to this
subsection exceeds the amount of that money which the Legislature
has authorized for expenditure during the first [90] 180 days of the
succeeding fiscal year.

Section 13:
2. Except for money transferred from the Unemployment
Compensation Administration Fund pursuant to subsection 1, the
Administrator may only expend the money collected for the
employment and training of unemployed persons and persons
employed in this State to:
(a) Establish and administer an employment training program
which must foster job creation, minimize unemployment costs of
