AN ACT relating to education; prohibiting the Board of Regents of the University
of Nevada from assessing tuition charges or certain fees against
students who are a surviving spouse or child of a [first responder who
was killed while acting in the normal course of duty in this State;]
person killed in the line of duty as a member of the Armed Forces
of the United States; revising certain provisions relating to the
waiver of certain fees for public safety officers who are killed in
the line of duty; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the Board of Regents of the University of Nevada to grant a
2 waiver of certain fees for persons with a connection to the Armed Forces of the United
3 States. (NRS 396.544, 396.5442, 396.5443, 396.5445) Section 1 of this bill requires the
4 Board of Regents to grant a waiver of registration fees and other fees to a person who is
5 a surviving spouse or child of a person killed in the line of duty while on active duty as a
6 member of the Armed Forces.
7 Existing law authorizes the Board of Regents [of the University of Nevada] to assess
8 tuition charges, which are charges that are in addition to registration fees and other fees
9 assessed against students who are residents of this State, for students at all campuses of the
10 Nevada System of Higher Education who are not residents of Nevada. Existing law also
11 prohibits the Board of Regents from assessing tuition charges against certain students. (NRS
12 396.540) [This] Section 1.5 of this bill adds to this prohibition students who are a surviving
13 spouse or child of a [first responder who was killed while acting in the normal course of duty
14 in this State.] person killed in the line of duty while on active duty as a member of the
15 Armed Forces.
16 Existing law requires the Board of Regents, to the extent money is available, to pay
17 certain fees and expenses associated with undergraduate classes taken at a school within
18 the System by the dependent child of a public safety officer who was killed in the line of
19 duty or any other public employee who was killed in the performance of his or her
20 duties. (NRS 396.545) Section 2 of this bill expands the applicability of this provision to
21 include the surviving spouse of such a public safety officer or such a public employee.

Senate Amendment No. 273 to Senate Bill No. 237 Page 4
22 Section 2 further revises the definition of a “public safety officer killed in the line of
23 duty” to include a public safety officer who, under certain circumstances, dies as a result
24 of injuries sustained while traveling to or from his or her place of employment.
