6 duty while on active duty as a member of the Armed Forces.
7 Existing law authorizes the Board of Regents to assess tuition charges, which
8 are charges that are in addition to registration fees and other fees assessed against
9 students who are residents of this State, for students at all campuses of the Nevada
10 System of Higher Education who are not residents of Nevada. Existing law also
11 prohibits the Board of Regents from assessing tuition charges against certain

17 school within the System by the dependent child of a public safety officer who was
18 killed in the line of duty or any other public employee who was killed in the
19 performance of his or her duties. (NRS 396.545) Section 2 of this bill expands the
20 applicability of this provision to include the surviving spouse of such a public
21 safety officer or such a public employee. Section 2 further revises the definition of
22 a “public safety officer killed in the line of duty” to include a public safety officer
23 who, under certain circumstances, dies as a result of injuries sustained while
24 traveling to or from his or her place of employment.
