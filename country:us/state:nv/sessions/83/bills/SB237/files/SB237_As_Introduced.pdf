AN ACT relating to education; prohibiting the Board of Regents of
the University of Nevada from assessing tuition charges
against students who are a surviving spouse or child of a
first responder who was killed while acting in the normal
course of duty in this State; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the Board of Regents of the University of Nevada to
2 assess tuition charges, which are charges that are in addition to registration fees and
3 other fees assessed against students who are residents of this State, for students at
4 all campuses of the Nevada System of Higher Education who are not residents of
5 Nevada. Existing law also prohibits the Board of Regents from assessing tuition
6 charges against certain students. (NRS 396.540) This bill adds to this prohibition
7 students who are a surviving spouse or child of a first responder who was killed
8 while acting in the normal course of duty in this State.
