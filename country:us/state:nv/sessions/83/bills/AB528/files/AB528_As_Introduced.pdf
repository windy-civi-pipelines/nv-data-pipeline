FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to energy; authorizing the Director of the Office
of Energy to accept new applications for property tax
abatements for certain buildings and structures which
meet certain energy efficiency standards; revising
requirements for the Green Building Rating System
adopted by the Director; revising the duration and amount
of partial abatements that are available; requiring the
Director to adopt certain regulations; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Director of the Office of Energy to grant a partial
2 abatement of certain property taxes for a building or other structure that meets
3 certain energy efficiency standards under the Green Building Rating System
4 adopted by the Director. However, existing law prohibits the Director from: (1)
5 approving applications for the partial tax abatement submitted on or after July 1,
6 2021; and (2) altering or amending the Green Building Rating System after that
7 date. (NRS 701A.100, 701A.110) Section 2 of this bill removes the prohibition on
8 the Director approving applications on or after July 1, 2021, thereby allowing the
9 Director to begin approving applications for the partial abatement again. Section 2
10 revises the amount and duration of the partial abatement available to buildings and
11 other structures meeting certain requirements to provide: (1) a partial abatement of
12 20-35 percent annually for a duration of not more than 10 years for a building or
-
*AB528*

– 2 –
13 other structure that is new; (2) a partial abatement of 20-35 percent annually for a
14 duration of not more than 5 years for an existing building or other structure which
15 did not receive a partial abatement before July 1, 2021; and (3) a partial abatement
16 of 5 percent annually for a duration of not more than 3 years for an existing
17 building or structure that previously received a partial abatement before July 1,
18 2021, and which is recertified under the Green Building Rating System.
19 Existing law requires the Green Building Rating System adopted by the
20 Director to include standards and ratings equivalent to the standards and ratings
21 provided pursuant to the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)
22 Green Building Rating System or an equivalent rating system. (NRS 701A.100)
23 Section 1 of this bill revises the requirements for the Green Building Rating System
24 adopted by the Director. Section 1 requires the Green Building Rating System
25 adopted by the Director to require a building or other structure which did not
26 receive an abatement before July 1, 2021, to obtain certain resilience credits to meet
27 the equivalent of the silver, gold, platinum or zero carbon level. The amount of the
28 partial abatement which a building or other structure is eligible to receive pursuant
29 to section 2 relates to which of these levels the building or other structure meets.
30 Section 1 requires the Director to adopt regulations identifying the credits under the
31 LEED Green Building Rating System or equivalent rating system that are deemed
32 resilience credits for the purposes of the Green Building Rating System adopted by
33 the Director. Section 1 requires the Green Building Rating System to require a new
34 building or other structure to have energy performance which exceeds the
35 applicable building code by certain percentage amounts to meet the equivalent of
36 the silver, gold or platinum level. Section 1 requires the Green Building Rating
37 System to require an existing building or other structure that has not previously
38 received a partial abatement to: (1) qualify for the alternative deduction for energy
39 efficient building retrofit property under the Internal Revenue Code; and (2) to
40 achieve net zero carbon emissions to meet the equivalent of the zero carbon level.
41 Section 1 requires the Green Building Rating System to require a building or other
42 structure that received a partial abatement before July 1, 2021, to obtain
43 recertification under the LEED Green Building Rating System or its equivalent and
44 either have energy performance which meets the requirements of the building code
45 of the applicable jurisdiction with respect to new buildings or qualify for the
46 alternative deduction for energy efficient building retrofit property. Section 1
47 requires the Green Building Rating System to require a building or other structure
48 that includes connected parking to obtain certain certifications with respect to such
49 parking.
50 Section 2 requires the Director to adopt regulations: (1) prescribing a procedure
51 for the State or a local government to obtain a partial abatement and, in exchange
52 for compensation, assign it to another building or other structure in the same county
53 that has also received a partial abatement; and (2) requiring recipients of a partial
54 abatement to annually report to the Office of Economic Development the energy
55 and water consumption of the building or other structure that is subject to a partial
56 abatement and such other information as the Director requires. Section 2 requires
57 the Director to include information relating to energy and water savings by
58 buildings and other structures that received a partial abatement in the annual report
59 the Director is required to submit to the Office.
