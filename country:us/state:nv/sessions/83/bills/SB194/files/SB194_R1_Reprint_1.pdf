EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to motor vehicles; requiring a short-term lessor to
require proof of certain insurance as a condition for the
lease of a passenger car; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits a short-term lessor from requiring the purchase of a
2 waiver of damages, optional insurance or any other optional good or service as a
3 condition for the lease of a passenger car. Existing law further prohibits a short-
4 term lessor from engaging in certain unfair, deceptive or coercive conduct to induce
5 a short-term lessee to purchase a waiver of damages, optional insurance or any
6 other optional good or service. (NRS 482.31565) This bill requires a short-term
7 lessor to require, as a condition for the lease of a passenger car, proof of insurance
8 that satisfies certain minimum insurance coverage requirements. Additionally, this
9 bill authorizes a short-term lessor to sell certain temporary policies of insurance or
10 refer a person to a third-party seller of such insurance. This bill further prohibits a
11 short-term lessor from offering or referring for sale such policies of insurance at a
12 rate exceeding the standard market rate of similar policies of insurance. Finally, this
13 bill provides that the sale of such a policy of insurance by a short-term lessor does
14 not constitute engaging in certain prohibited unfair, deceptive or coercive conduct.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. (Deleted by amendment.)
2 Sec. 2. NRS 482.31565 is hereby amended to read as follows:

– 2 –
1 waiver of damages, optional insurance or any other optional good or
2 service as a condition for the lease of a passenger car.
3 2. A short-term lessor shall require that a person seeking to
4 lease a passenger car provide proof of insurance that satisfies the
5 minimum amount of insurance coverage set forth in NRS 485.185
6 as a condition for the lease of the passenger car. If a person
7 seeking to lease a passenger car cannot provide proof of such
8 insurance, the short-term lessor may:
9 (a) Sell the person a temporary policy of insurance that
10 satisfies the minimum amount of coverage set forth in NRS
11 485.185 or refer the person to a third-party that sells a temporary
12 policy of insurance that satisfies such requirements. A temporary
13 policy of insurance offered or referred for sale by a short-term
14 lessor must be offered at a rate that does not exceed the standard
15 market rate for similar policies of insurance.
16 (b) If the person refuses to purchase a temporary policy of
17 insurance, refuse to lease the passenger car to the person.
18 3. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, a short-term
19 lessor may sell a waiver of damages but shall charge:
20 (a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b), not more than
21 $22 per full or partial rental day or 24-hour rental period, as
22 appropriate, for the waiver. The amount of the charge set forth in
23 this paragraph must be adjusted for each fiscal year that begins on or
24 after July 1, 2008, by adding to that amount the product of that
25 amount multiplied by the percentage increase in the Consumer Price
26 Index West Urban for All Urban Consumers (All Items) between the
27 calendar year ending on December 31, 2005, and the calendar year
28 immediately preceding the fiscal year for which the adjustment is
29 made. The Department shall, on or before March 1 of each year,
30 publish the adjusted amount for the next fiscal year on its website or
31 otherwise make that information available to short-term lessors.
32 (b) If the vehicle has a manufacturer’s suggested retail price of
33 more than $60,000, not more than $150 per full or partial rental day
34 or 24-hour rental period, as appropriate, for the waiver. The
35 monetary amounts set forth in this paragraph must be adjusted for
36 each fiscal year that begins on or after July 1, 2021, by adding to
37 each amount the product of that amount multiplied by the
38 percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index West Urban for
39 All Urban Consumers (All Items) between the calendar year ending
40 on December 31, 2017, and the calendar year immediately
41 preceding the fiscal year for which the adjustment is made. The
42 Department shall, on or before March 1 of each year, publish the
43 adjusted amounts for the next fiscal year on its Internet website or
44 otherwise make that information available to short-term lessors.
