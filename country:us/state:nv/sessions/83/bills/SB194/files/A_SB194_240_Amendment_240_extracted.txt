FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to motor vehicles; [exempting replacement vehicles from the
governmental services fee charged and collected for the short-term]
requiring a short-term lessor to require proof of certain insurance
as a condition for the lease of a passenger car; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 [Upon the lease of a passenger car by a short-term lessor in this State, existing law
2 requires, with certain exceptions, the short-term lessor to charge and collect from the short-
3 term lessee a governmental services fee of 10 percent of the total amount for which the
4 passenger car was leased, excluding any taxes and other fees imposed by a governmental
5 entity and certain other items. (NRS 482.313) This bill exempts the short-term rental or lease
6 of a replacement vehicle from the charging and collecting of this governmental services fee.]
7 Existing law prohibits a short-term lessor from requiring the purchase of a waiver of
8 damages, optional insurance or any other optional good or service as a condition for the
9 lease of a passenger car. Existing law further prohibits a short-term lessor from
10 engaging in certain unfair, deceptive or coercive conduct to induce a short-term lessee to
11 purchase a waiver of damages, optional insurance or any other optional good or service.
12 (NRS 482.31565) This bill requires a short-term lessor to require, as a condition for the
13 lease of a passenger car, proof of insurance that satisfies certain minimum insurance
14 coverage requirements. Additionally, this bill authorizes a short-term lessor to sell
15 certain temporary policies of insurance or refer a person to a third-party seller of such
16 insurance. This bill further prohibits a short-term lessor from offering or referring for
17 sale such policies of insurance at a rate exceeding the standard market rate of similar
18 policies of insurance. Finally, this bill provides that the sale of such a policy of insurance
19 by a short-term lessor does not constitute engaging in certain prohibited unfair,
20 deceptive or coercive conduct.

38 amount of the charge set forth in this paragraph must be adjusted for each fiscal
39 year that begins on or after July 1, 2008, by adding to that amount the product of
40 that amount multiplied by the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index

42 on December 31, 2005, and the calendar year immediately preceding the fiscal year

7 and a statement that the waiver is optional.
8 [4.] 5. A short-term lessor shall not engage in any unfair, deceptive or
9 coercive conduct to induce a short-term lessee to purchase a waiver of damages,
10 optional insurance or any other optional good or service, including, but not limited
11 to, refusing to honor the lessee’s reservation, limiting the availability of cars,
12 requiring a deposit or debiting or blocking the lessee’s credit card account for a sum
13 equivalent to a deposit if the lessee declines to purchase a waiver, optional
14 insurance or any other optional good or service.
15 6. For the purposes of subsection 5, the sale of a policy of insurance by a
