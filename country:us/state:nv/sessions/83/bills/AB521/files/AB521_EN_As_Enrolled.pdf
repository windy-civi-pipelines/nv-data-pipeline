Health and Human Services
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to the protection of children; requiring an
investigation of the history of abuse or neglect of certain
persons associated with certain medical facilities and
organizations; requiring such a facility to terminate the
employment of such persons based on the results of such an
investigation under certain circumstances; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law establishes the Statewide Central Registry for the Collection of
Information Concerning the Abuse or Neglect of a Child, which contains
information regarding any substantiated report of child abuse or neglect made
pursuant to existing law. Existing law authorizes the Division of Child and Family
Services of the Department of Health and Human Services to release information
contained in the Statewide Central Registry to an employer under certain
circumstances to determine whether a person whose background is being
investigated by the employer has been found to have abused or neglected a child.
(NRS 432.100)
Section 1 of this bill defines “Statewide Central Registry” as the Statewide
Central Registry for the Collection of Information Concerning the Abuse or Neglect
of a Child. Section 2 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law and section 1
to the provisions of sections 3-7 of this bill.
Sections 3 and 4 require an applicant for a license, a license holder and certain
employees and independent contractors of certain facilities to provide written
authorization for the release of any information within the immediately preceding 5
years that may be stored in the Statewide Central Registry to determine whether
there has been a substantiated report of child abuse or neglect made against the
person. Section 5 similarly requires certain employees and independent contractors
of certain intermediary service organizations to provide written authorization for
the release of any information within the immediately preceding 5 years that may
be stored in the Statewide Central Registry to determine whether there has been a
substantiated report of child abuse or neglect made against the person. Section 6
requires the holder of a certificate to operate an intermediary service organization
to terminate the employment of a person who has had a substantiated report of child
abuse or neglect made against him or her. Section 7 authorizes the Division to
deny, suspend or revoke a certificate to operate an intermediary service
organization if the holder of the certificate: (1) has continued to employ a person
who has had a substantiated report of child abuse or neglect made against him or
her; or (2) has had a substantiated report of child abuse or neglect made against him
or her.
