Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes the Statewide Central Registry for the Collection of Information

3 substantiated report of child abuse or neglect made pursuant to existing law. Existing law
4 authorizes the Division of Child and Family Services of the Department of Health and Human

6 under certain circumstances to determine whether a person whose background is being
7 investigated by the employer has been found to have abused or neglected a child. (NRS
8 432.100)
9 Section 1 of this bill defines “Statewide Central Registry” as the Statewide Central
10 Registry for the Collection of Information Concerning the Abuse or Neglect of a Child.
11 Section 2 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law and section 1 to the provisions of
12 sections 3-7 of this bill.
13 Sections 3 and 4 require an applicant for a license, a license holder and certain
14 employees and independent contractors of certain facilities to provide written authorization
15 for the release of any information within the immediately preceding 5 years that may be stored
16 in the Statewide Central Registry to determine whether there has been a substantiated report of
17 child abuse or neglect made against the person. Section 5 similarly requires certain employees
18 and independent contractors of certain intermediary service organizations to provide written
19 authorization for the release of any information within the immediately preceding 5 years that
20 may be stored in the Statewide Central Registry to determine whether there has been a
21 substantiated report of child abuse or neglect made against the person. Section 6 requires the
22 holder of a certificate to operate an intermediary service organization to terminate the
23 employment of a person who has had a substantiated report of child abuse or neglect made
24 against him or her. Section 7 authorizes the Division to deny, suspend or revoke a certificate
25 to operate an intermediary service organization if the holder of the certificate: (1) has
26 continued to employ a person who has had a substantiated report of child abuse or neglect

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes the Statewide Central Registry for the Collection of Information
2 Concerning the Abuse or Neglect of a Child, which contains information regarding any
3 substantiated report of child abuse or neglect made pursuant to existing law. Existing law
4 authorizes the Division of Child and Family Services of the Department of Health and Human
5 Services to release information contained in the Statewide Central Registry to an employer
6 under certain circumstances to determine whether a person whose background is being
7 investigated by the employer has been found to have abused or neglected a child. (NRS
8 432.100)
9 Section 1 of this bill defines “Statewide Central Registry” as the Statewide Central
10 Registry for the Collection of Information Concerning the Abuse or Neglect of a Child.
11 Section 2 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law and section 1 to the provisions of
12 sections 3-7 of this bill.
13 Sections 3 and 4 require an applicant for a license, a license holder and certain
14 employees and independent contractors of certain facilities to provide written authorization
15 for the release of any information within the immediately preceding 5 years that may be stored
16 in the Statewide Central Registry to determine whether there has been a substantiated report of
17 child abuse or neglect made against the person. Section 5 similarly requires certain employees
18 and independent contractors of certain intermediary service organizations to provide written
19 authorization for the release of any information within the immediately preceding 5 years that
20 may be stored in the Statewide Central Registry to determine whether there has been a
21 substantiated report of child abuse or neglect made against the person. Section 6 requires the
22 holder of a certificate to operate an intermediary service organization to terminate the
23 employment of a person who has had a substantiated report of child abuse or neglect made
24 against him or her. Section 7 authorizes the Division to deny, suspend or revoke a certificate
25 to operate an intermediary service organization if the holder of the certificate: (1) has
26 continued to employ a person who has had a substantiated report of child abuse or neglect

Assembly Amendment No. 457 to Assembly Bill No. 521 Page 4
