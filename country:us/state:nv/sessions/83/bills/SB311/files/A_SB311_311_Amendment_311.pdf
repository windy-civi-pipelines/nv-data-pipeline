EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to trade practices; imposing certain requirements upon certain
alarm companies with respect to an alarm system that becomes
defective or inoperative; providing penalties; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Section 1 of this bill imposes certain requirements upon an “alarm company,” which
2 section 1 defines to mean a person who engages in the sale, installation, service, maintenance,
3 repair or replacement of an alarm system or the provision of monitoring services. Section 1
4 defines “monitoring services” to mean, in general, receiving signals indicating that an alarm
5 system has been activated and notifying a public safety agency of that information.
6 Section 1 requires an alarm company that, pursuant to a contract with a customer of the
7 alarm company, has installed an alarm system at the home or business of the customer and
8 charges the customer a monthly fee to perform monitoring services, [as soon as practicable]
9 not later than 5 business days after receiving notice from the customer that the alarm system
10 is defective or inoperative, to: (1) repair or replace the defective or inoperative alarm system
11 or any component thereof; or (2) cancel the remainder of the contract and refund any unearned
12 money paid by the customer. If the alarm company cancels the contract, section 1 prohibits
13 the alarm company from charging the customer a penalty, fee, forfeiture of deposit or any
14 additional cost because of the cancellation.
15 Existing law defines activities that constitute deceptive trade practices and provides for
16 the imposition of civil and criminal penalties against persons who engage in deceptive trade
17 practices. (Chapter 598 of NRS) Section 1 provides that a violation of the provisions of
18 section 1 constitutes a deceptive trade practice.

11 unearned money paid in advance or as a deposit.
12 2. An alarm company who cancels a contract pursuant to paragraph (b) of
13 subsection 1 shall not charge the customer a penalty, fee, forfeiture of deposit or
