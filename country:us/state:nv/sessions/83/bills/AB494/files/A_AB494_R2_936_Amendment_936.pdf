2 govern how states and public agencies provide early intervention, special education and
3 related services to pupils with disabilities. (20 U.S.C. §§ 1400 et seq.; 34 C.F.R. Part 300) The
4 federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 and its corresponding regulations

11 electronically such health information in certain transactions. (Pub. L. No. 104-191; 42 U.S.C.
12 §§ 1320d et seq.) Existing federal law prohibits discrimination based on race, color or national
13 origin in any program or activity that receives federal funding. (Title VI of the Civil Rights

24 carrying out duties pursuant to provisions of federal laws and regulations which have been
