EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; providing [in skeleton form] that the provisions of
certain federal laws and applicable regulations continue to apply in this
State if the laws and regulations are repealed by the Federal
Government; authorizing certain persons to bring a civil action in a

relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 The federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and its corresponding regulations
2 govern how states and public agencies provide early intervention, special education and
3 related services to pupils with disabilities. (20 U.S.C. §§ 1400 et seq.; 34 C.F.R. Part 300) The
4 federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 and its corresponding regulations
5 set forth certain requirements governing the privacy and availability of education records at
6 schools and institutions that receive federal funding. (20 U.S.C. § 1232g; 34 C.F.R. Part 99)
7 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and its corresponding
8 regulations: (1) protect the privacy of certain individually identifiable health information; and
9 (2) include provisions concerning the disclosure of such health information by certain covered
10 entities, including, without limitation, health care providers who transmit electronically such
11 health information in certain transactions. (Pub. L. No. 104-191; 42 U.S.C. §§ 1320d et seq.)
12 Existing federal law prohibits discrimination based on race, color or national origin in any
13 program or activity that receives federal funding. (Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42
14 U.S.C. §§ 2000d et seq.) Existing federal law prohibits discrimination based on sex in
15 programs or activities of education that receive federal funding. (Title IX of the Education
16 Amendments Act of 1972, 20 U.S.C. §§ 1681 et seq.; 34 C.F.R. Part 106) The federal Every
17 Student Succeeds Act of 2015 sets forth, without limitation, certain requirements for
18 accountability, assessment and instruction to which a state must adhere to receive
Assembly Amendment No. 169 to Assembly Bill No. 494 Page 4
19 federal funding. (20 U.S.C. §§ 6301 et seq.) Sections [2-6] 2-6.3 of this bill provide [, in
20 skeleton form,] that, if any of these federal laws or regulations are repealed by the Federal
21 Government, the provisions of the repealed federal laws or regulations, as they existed on
22 [July] January 1, 2025, continue to apply in this State. Section 2 additionally provides that, if
23 the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act is repealed, a person who previously had the
24 right to bring a civil action in a district court of the United States is authorized to bring such
25 an action in a court of competent jurisdiction of this State. Section 6.7 of this bill requires
26 the Department of Education to, if any such federal laws are repealed: (1) not later than
27 6 months after such a repeal, adopt regulations to carry out the provisions of the
28 repealed federal law in this State; and (2) carry out the provisions of the repealed federal
29 law in this State. Section 6.3 requires the Interim Finance Committee to make certain
30 determinations regarding certain block grants provided by the Federal Government
31 before accepting such block grants. Section 7 of this bill makes a conforming change to
32 indicate the proper placement of section 1 in the Nevada Revised Statutes.
