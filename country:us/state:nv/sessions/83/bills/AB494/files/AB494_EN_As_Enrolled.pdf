Assembly Bill No. 494–Committee on Education
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to governmental administration; requiring certain
state agencies to prepare a report if the provisions of certain
federal laws and regulations are repealed by the Federal
Government; authorizing such state agencies to adopt certain
regulations if such federal laws and applicable regulations are
repealed by the Federal Government; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
The federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and its corresponding
regulations govern how states and public agencies provide early intervention,
special education and related services to pupils with disabilities. (20 U.S.C. §§
1400 et seq.; 34 C.F.R. Part 300) The federal Family Educational Rights and
Privacy Act of 1974 and its corresponding regulations set forth certain requirements
governing the privacy and availability of education records at schools and
institutions that receive federal funding. (20 U.S.C. § 1232g; 34 C.F.R. Part 99)
The federal Every Student Succeeds Act of 2015 sets forth, without limitation,
certain requirements for accountability, assessment and instruction to which a state
must adhere to receive federal funding. (20 U.S.C. §§ 6301 et seq.) Sections 2, 3
and 6.3 of this bill provide that, if any of these federal laws or regulations are
repealed by the Federal Government, in whole or in part, the Department of
Education is required to prepare a report which includes: (1) recommendations
concerning how funding may be used to continue carrying out duties pursuant to
provisions of federal laws and regulations which have been repealed; and (2) an
analysis of the Nevada Revised Statutes to determine if provisions of the relevant
federal law which were repealed should be incorporated into the Nevada Revised
Statutes. Sections 2, 3 and 6.3 additionally authorize the Department to adopt
regulations which are substantially similar to any provisions of the relevant federal
laws or regulations which were repealed. Section 7 of this bill makes a conforming
change to indicate the proper placement of section 2 in the Nevada Revised
Statutes.
Existing federal law prohibits discrimination based on sex in programs or
activities of education that receive federal funding. (Title IX of the Education
Amendments Act of 1972, 20 U.S.C. §§ 1681 et seq.; 34 C.F.R. Part 106) Section
7.1 of this bill requires the Board of Regents of the University of Nevada, if Title
IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972, or the regulations adopted pursuant
thereto, are repealed by the Federal Government, in whole or in part, to prepare a
report which is substantially similar to the reports required pursuant to sections 2, 3
and 6.3 and authorizes the Board of Regents to adopt regulations which are
substantially similar to any provisions of Title IX of the Education Amendments
Act of 1972 or the regulations adopted pursuant thereto which were repealed.
Existing federal law prohibits discrimination based on race, color or national
origin in any program or activity that receives federal funding. (Title VI of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000d et seq.) Section 7.3 of this bill requires the
Division of Human Resource Management of the Department of Administration, if
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 or the regulations adopted pursuant thereto
are repealed by the Federal Government, in whole or in part, to prepare a report
which is substantially similar to the reports required pursuant to sections 2, 3 and
6.3 and authorizes the Department of Administration to adopt regulations which are
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 2 –
substantially similar to any provisions of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 or
the regulations adopted pursuant thereto which were repealed. Section 7.5 of this
bill applies certain definitions relating to the Department of Administration to the
provisions of section 7.3.
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and its
corresponding regulations: (1) protect the privacy of certain personally identifiable
health information; and (2) include provisions concerning the disclosure of such
health information by certain covered entities, including, without limitation, health
care providers who transmit electronically such health information in certain
transactions. (Pub. L. No. 104-191; 42 U.S.C. §§ 1320d et seq.) Section 7.7 of this
bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services, if the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 or the regulations adopted pursuant
thereto are repealed by the Federal Government, in whole or in part, to prepare a
report which is substantially similar to the reports required pursuant to sections 2, 3
and 6.3 and authorizes the Department of Health and Human Services to adopt
regulations which are substantially similar to any provisions of the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 or the regulations adopted
pursuant thereto which were repealed.
