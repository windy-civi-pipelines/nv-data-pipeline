EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; providing that the provisions of
certain federal laws and applicable regulations continue to

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 The federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and its corresponding
2 regulations govern how states and public agencies provide early intervention,
3 special education and related services to pupils with disabilities. (20 U.S.C. §§
4 1400 et seq.; 34 C.F.R. Part 300) The federal Family Educational Rights and
5 Privacy Act of 1974 and its corresponding regulations set forth certain requirements
6 governing the privacy and availability of education records at schools and
7 institutions that receive federal funding. (20 U.S.C. § 1232g; 34 C.F.R. Part 99)
8 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and its
9 corresponding regulations: (1) protect the privacy of certain individually
10 identifiable health information; and (2) include provisions concerning the
11 disclosure of such health information by certain covered entities, including, without
-
*AB494_R1*

12 limitation, health care providers who transmit electronically such health
13 information in certain transactions. (Pub. L. No. 104-191; 42 U.S.C. §§ 1320d et
14 seq.) Existing federal law prohibits discrimination based on race, color or national
15 origin in any program or activity that receives federal funding. (Title VI of the Civil
16 Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000d et seq.) Existing federal law prohibits
17 discrimination based on sex in programs or activities of education that receive
18 federal funding. (Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972, 20 U.S.C. §§
19 1681 et seq.; 34 C.F.R. Part 106) The federal Every Student Succeeds Act of 2015
20 sets forth, without limitation, certain requirements for accountability, assessment
21 and instruction to which a state must adhere to receive federal funding. (20 U.S.C.
22 §§ 6301 et seq.) Sections 2-6.3 of this bill provide that, if any of these federal laws
23 or regulations are repealed by the Federal Government, the provisions of the
24 repealed federal laws or regulations, as they existed on January 1, 2025, continue to
25 apply in this State. Section 2 additionally provides that, if the Individuals with
26 Disabilities Education Act is repealed, a person who previously had the right to
27 bring a civil action in a district court of the United States is authorized to bring such
28 an action in a court of competent jurisdiction of this State. Section 6.7 of this bill
29 requires the Department of Education to, if any such federal laws are repealed: (1)
30 not later than 6 months after such a repeal, adopt regulations to carry out the
31 provisions of the repealed federal law in this State; and (2) carry out the provisions
32 of the repealed federal law in this State. Section 6.3 requires the Interim Finance
33 Committee to make certain determinations regarding certain block grants provided
34 by the Federal Government before accepting such block grants. Section 7 of this
35 bill makes a conforming change to indicate the proper placement of section 1 in the
36 Nevada Revised Statutes.
