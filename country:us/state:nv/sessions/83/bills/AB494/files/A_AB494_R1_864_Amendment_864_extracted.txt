Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 The federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and its corresponding regulations
2 govern how states and public agencies provide early intervention, special education and
3 related services to pupils with disabilities. (20 U.S.C. §§ 1400 et seq.; 34 C.F.R. Part 300) The
4 federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 and its corresponding regulations
5 set forth certain requirements governing the privacy and availability of education records at
6 schools and institutions that receive federal funding. (20 U.S.C. § 1232g; 34 C.F.R. Part 99)
7 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and its corresponding
8 regulations: (1) protect the privacy of certain individually identifiable health information; and
9 (2) include provisions concerning the disclosure of such health information by certain covered
10 entities, including, without limitation, health care providers who transmit electronically such
11 health information in certain transactions. (Pub. L. No. 104-191; 42 U.S.C. §§ 1320d et seq.)
12 Existing federal law prohibits discrimination based on race, color or national origin in any
13 program or activity that receives federal funding. (Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42
14 U.S.C. §§ 2000d et seq.) Existing federal law prohibits discrimination based on sex in
15 programs or activities of education that receive federal funding. (Title IX of the Education
16 Amendments Act of 1972, 20 U.S.C. §§ 1681 et seq.; 34 C.F.R. Part 106) The federal Every
17 Student Succeeds Act of 2015 sets forth, without limitation, certain requirements for
18 accountability, assessment and instruction to which a state must adhere to receive federal
Assembly Amendment No. 864 to Assembly Bill No. 494 First Reprint Page 4
19 funding. (20 U.S.C. §§ 6301 et seq.) Sections 2-6.3 of this bill provide that, if any of these
20 federal laws or regulations are repealed by the Federal Government, in whole or in part, the
21 [provisions of the repealed federal laws or regulations, as they existed on January 1, 2025,
22 continue to apply in this State. Section 2 additionally provides that, if the Individuals with
23 Disabilities Education Act is repealed, a person who previously had the right to bring a civil
24 action in a district court of the United States is authorized to bring such an action in a court of
25 competent jurisdiction of this State. Section 6.7 of this bill requires the Department of
26 Education to, if any such federal laws are repealed: (1) not later than 6 months after such a
27 repeal, adopt regulations to carry out the provisions of the repealed federal law in this State;
28 and (2) carry out the provisions of the repealed federal law in this State. Section 6.3 requires
29 the Interim Finance Committee to make certain determinations regarding certain block grants
30 provided by the Federal Government before accepting such block grants.] Department of
31 Education, in collaboration with the Nevada System of Higher Education in certain
32 circumstances, is required to prepare a report which includes: (1) recommendations
33 concerning how funding may be used to continue carrying out duties pursuant to
34 provisions of federal laws and regulations which have been repealed; and (2) an analysis
35 of the Nevada Revised Statutes to determine if provisions of the relevant federal law
36 which were repealed should be incorporated into the Nevada Revised Statutes. Sections
37 2-6.3 additionally authorize the Department to adopt regulations which are substantially
38 similar to any provisions of the relevant federal laws or regulations which were repealed.
39 Section 7 of this bill makes a conforming change to indicate the proper placement of section 2
40 in the Nevada Revised Statutes.

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; [providing that] requiring the Department of
Education to prepare a report if the provisions of certain federal
laws and [applicable] regulations [continue to apply in this State if the
laws and regulations] are repealed by the Federal Government;

Federal Government; [requiring the Interim Finance Committee to

and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 The federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and its corresponding regulations
2 govern how states and public agencies provide early intervention, special education and
3 related services to pupils with disabilities. (20 U.S.C. §§ 1400 et seq.; 34 C.F.R. Part 300) The
4 federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 and its corresponding regulations
5 set forth certain requirements governing the privacy and availability of education records at
6 schools and institutions that receive federal funding. (20 U.S.C. § 1232g; 34 C.F.R. Part 99)
7 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and its corresponding
8 regulations: (1) protect the privacy of certain individually identifiable health information; and
9 (2) include provisions concerning the disclosure of such health information by certain covered
10 entities, including, without limitation, health care providers who transmit electronically such
11 health information in certain transactions. (Pub. L. No. 104-191; 42 U.S.C. §§ 1320d et seq.)
12 Existing federal law prohibits discrimination based on race, color or national origin in any
13 program or activity that receives federal funding. (Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42
14 U.S.C. §§ 2000d et seq.) Existing federal law prohibits discrimination based on sex in
15 programs or activities of education that receive federal funding. (Title IX of the Education
16 Amendments Act of 1972, 20 U.S.C. §§ 1681 et seq.; 34 C.F.R. Part 106) The federal Every
17 Student Succeeds Act of 2015 sets forth, without limitation, certain requirements for
18 accountability, assessment and instruction to which a state must adhere to receive federal

Assembly Amendment No. 864 to Assembly Bill No. 494 First Reprint Page 4
19 funding. (20 U.S.C. §§ 6301 et seq.) Sections 2-6.3 of this bill provide that, if any of these
20 federal laws or regulations are repealed by the Federal Government, in whole or in part, the
21 [provisions of the repealed federal laws or regulations, as they existed on January 1, 2025,
22 continue to apply in this State. Section 2 additionally provides that, if the Individuals with
23 Disabilities Education Act is repealed, a person who previously had the right to bring a civil
24 action in a district court of the United States is authorized to bring such an action in a court of
25 competent jurisdiction of this State. Section 6.7 of this bill requires the Department of
26 Education to, if any such federal laws are repealed: (1) not later than 6 months after such a
27 repeal, adopt regulations to carry out the provisions of the repealed federal law in this State;
28 and (2) carry out the provisions of the repealed federal law in this State. Section 6.3 requires
29 the Interim Finance Committee to make certain determinations regarding certain block grants
30 provided by the Federal Government before accepting such block grants.] Department of
31 Education, in collaboration with the Nevada System of Higher Education in certain
32 circumstances, is required to prepare a report which includes: (1) recommendations
33 concerning how funding may be used to continue carrying out duties pursuant to
34 provisions of federal laws and regulations which have been repealed; and (2) an analysis
35 of the Nevada Revised Statutes to determine if provisions of the relevant federal law
36 which were repealed should be incorporated into the Nevada Revised Statutes. Sections
37 2-6.3 additionally authorize the Department to adopt regulations which are substantially
38 similar to any provisions of the relevant federal laws or regulations which were repealed.
39 Section 7 of this bill makes a conforming change to indicate the proper placement of section 2
40 in the Nevada Revised Statutes.
