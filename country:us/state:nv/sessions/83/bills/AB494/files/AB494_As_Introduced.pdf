AN ACT relating to education; providing in skeleton form that the

regulations are repealed by the Federal Government;

and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 The federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and its corresponding
2 regulations govern how states and public agencies provide early intervention,
3 special education and related services to pupils with disabilities. (20 U.S.C. §§
4 1400 et seq.; 34 C.F.R. Part 300) The federal Family Educational Rights and
5 Privacy Act of 1974 and its corresponding regulations set forth certain requirements
6 governing the privacy and availability of education records at schools and
7 institutions that receive federal funding. (20 U.S.C. § 1232g; 34 C.F.R. Part 99)
8 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and its
9 corresponding regulations: (1) protect the privacy of certain individually
10 identifiable health information; and (2) include provisions concerning the
11 disclosure of such health information by certain covered entities, including, without
12 limitation, health care providers who transmit electronically such health
13 information in certain transactions. (Pub. L. No. 104-191; 42 U.S.C. §§ 1320d et
14 seq.) Existing federal law prohibits discrimination based on race, color or national
15 origin in any program or activity that receives federal funding. (Title VI of the Civil
16 Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000d et seq.) Existing federal law prohibits
17 discrimination based on sex in programs or activities of education that receive

18 federal funding. (Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972, 20 U.S.C. §§
19 1681 et seq.; 34 C.F.R. Part 106) Sections 2-6 of this bill provide, in skeleton form,
20 that, if any of these federal laws or regulations are repealed by the Federal
21 Government, the provisions of the repealed federal laws or regulations, as they
22 existed on July 1, 2025, continue to apply in this State. Section 2 additionally
23 provides that, if the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act is repealed, a
24 person who previously had the right to bring a civil action in a district court of the
25 United States is authorized to bring such an action in a court of competent
26 jurisdiction of this State. Section 7 of this bill makes a conforming change to
27 indicate the proper placement of section 1 in the Nevada Revised Statutes.
