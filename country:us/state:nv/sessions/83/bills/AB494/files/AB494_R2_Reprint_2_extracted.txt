AN ACT relating to education; requiring the Department of
Education to prepare a report if the provisions of certain
federal laws and regulations are repealed by the Federal
Government; authorizing the Department of Education to
adopt certain regulations if such federal laws and
applicable regulations are repealed by the Federal
Government; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 The federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and its corresponding
2 regulations govern how states and public agencies provide early intervention,
3 special education and related services to pupils with disabilities. (20 U.S.C. §§
4 1400 et seq.; 34 C.F.R. Part 300) The federal Family Educational Rights and
5 Privacy Act of 1974 and its corresponding regulations set forth certain requirements
6 governing the privacy and availability of education records at schools and
7 institutions that receive federal funding. (20 U.S.C. § 1232g; 34 C.F.R. Part 99)
8 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and its
9 corresponding regulations: (1) protect the privacy of certain individually
10 identifiable health information; and (2) include provisions concerning the
11 disclosure of such health information by certain covered entities, including, without
12 limitation, health care providers who transmit electronically such health
13 information in certain transactions. (Pub. L. No. 104-191; 42 U.S.C. §§ 1320d et
14 seq.) Existing federal law prohibits discrimination based on race, color or national
15 origin in any program or activity that receives federal funding. (Title VI of the Civil
16 Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000d et seq.) Existing federal law prohibits
17 discrimination based on sex in programs or activities of education that receive
18 federal funding. (Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972, 20 U.S.C. §§
19 1681 et seq.; 34 C.F.R. Part 106) The federal Every Student Succeeds Act of 2015

21 and instruction to which a state must adhere to receive federal funding. (20 U.S.C.
22 §§ 6301 et seq.) Sections 2-6.3 of this bill provide that, if any of these federal laws
23 or regulations are repealed by the Federal Government, in whole or in part, the
24 Department of Education, in collaboration with the Nevada System of Higher
25 Education in certain circumstances, is required to prepare a report which includes:
26 (1) recommendations concerning how funding may be used to continue carrying out
27 duties pursuant to provisions of federal laws and regulations which have been
28 repealed; and (2) an analysis of the Nevada Revised Statutes to determine if
29 provisions of the relevant federal law which were repealed should be incorporated
30 into the Nevada Revised Statutes. Sections 2-6.3 additionally authorize the
31 Department to adopt regulations which are substantially similar to any provisions of
32 the relevant federal laws or regulations which were repealed. Section 7 of this bill
33 makes a conforming change to indicate the proper placement of section 2 in the
34 Nevada Revised Statutes.

26 (1) recommendations concerning how funding may be used to continue carrying out
27 duties pursuant to provisions of federal laws and regulations which have been
