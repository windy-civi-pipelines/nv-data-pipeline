AN ACT relating to state buildings; authorizing the Administrator

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law: (1) provides that, at all times, the maintenance of the Capitol
2 Building is under the supervision of the Administrator of the State Public Works
3 Division of the Department of Administration; and (2) requires the Administrator to
4 assign certain rooms in the Capitol Building for use in such manner as the public
5 service may require. Further, existing law places the former Assembly, Senate and
6 Supreme Court chambers on the second floor of the Capitol Building under the
7 management of the Museum Director of the Nevada State Museum for the purpose
8 of establishing and maintaining a Government Museum. (NRS 331.120, 331.130)
9 Section 1 of this bill authorizes the Administrator, in coordination with the
10 Museum Director, to rent or lease rooms in the Capitol Building for the purpose of
11 holding an event.
12 Existing law makes it a misdemeanor for any person to sell, barter, give, or in
13 any way dispose of any spirituous or malt liquors, wines or cider, of any description
14 whatever, within the Capitol Building. (NRS 331.190) Section 3 of this bill creates
15 an exception to this provision of law for an event that is held in the Capitol
16 Building pursuant to section 1.
17 Section 2 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law governing the
18 administration and control of state buildings, grounds and properties to the
