EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public safety; providing that certain provisions governing the
organization of a metropolitan police department do not prohibit a
participating political subdivision from establishing and administering
a unit of specialized law enforcement consisting of officers [which are
employed by certain departments or divisions] that provide public
safety services; setting forth the jurisdiction and authority of officers of
such a unit; revising provisions governing the jurisdiction and authority
of certain units of specialized law enforcement established in a county
in which a metropolitan police department has been organized;
requiring certain officers of such a unit to wear portable event
recording devices; providing that certain officers of such units have the
powers of a peace officer; providing that such officers are police
officers for purposes of certain provisions governing occupational
diseases; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the board of county commissioners of any county and the
2 governing body of any city or cities located in the county to merge their respective law
3 enforcement agencies into one metropolitan police department and provides that upon merger,
4 the law enforcement agencies of each participating political subdivision, which are designated
5 in the merger, are deemed superseded as long as the ordinance providing for the merger
6 remains in effect. (NRS 280.110, 280.120) Existing law provides that such a merger does not
7 prohibit a participating political subdivision from establishing and administering certain units
8 of specialized law enforcement, including a unit consisting of park rangers and a unit
9 consisting of marshals. Existing law further provides that the jurisdiction and authority of any
10 such unit is concurrent with the authority and jurisdiction of the metropolitan police
11 department but that the authority and jurisdiction of a unit consisting of marshals or park
12 rangers is limited to certain circumstances. (NRS 280.125) Section 2 of this bill includes [,
13 with certain exceptions,] in the list of such circumstances [, the enforcement of state laws and
14 city and county ordinances within the authority and jurisdiction of the metropolitan police
15 department if the park ranger or marshal reasonably believes that an immediate response is
16 necessary to protect the physical safety of a person or others from an immediate threat of
17 physical injury or to protect against an immediate threat of severe property damage. Section 2
18 further requires a park ranger or marshal who takes such actions to: (1) immediately notify the
19 primary law enforcement agency that he or she is responding to the threat; and (2) unless

Senate Amendment No. 517 to Senate Bill No. 449 Page 4
20 otherwise directed by the primary law enforcement agency or] any purpose authorized in an
21 interlocal or cooperative agreement [, investigate and take any enforcement action necessary
22 to protect the physical safety of] entered into by [a person or others from an immediate threat
23 of physical injury or to protect against an immediate threat of severe property damage.] the
24 sheriff of the county in which the metropolitan police department is located and the
25 participating political subdivision.
26 Section 2 additionally provides that such a merger does not prohibit a participating
27 political subdivision from establishing and administering a unit consisting of officers [of the
28 participating political subdivision which are employed by a department or division established
29 by the participating political subdivision to] that provide public safety services and similarly
30 limits, with certain exceptions, the authority and jurisdiction of such a unit to that of a unit of
31 park rangers or marshals. Sections 3-7 and 10 of this bill make conforming changes to: (1)
32 reflect that the duties of such an officer under such circumstances are coextensive with the
33 duties of such a park ranger or marshal; and (2) make such an officer subject to certain similar
34 requirements as such a park ranger or marshal. Section 11 of this bill provides that such an
35 officer is a “police officer” for purposes of certain provisions relating to occupational
36 diseases.
37 [Section 1: (1) requires, in a county whose population is 700,000 or more (currently only
38 Clark County), a unit consisting of such officers to provide, under certain circumstances,
39 assistance to another law enforcement agency that requests such assistance; (2) provides that
40 the unit is deemed to have the authority and jurisdiction of the law enforcement agency for the
41 purpose of assisting the law enforcement agency; (3) requires an officer of such a unit to
42 provide certain notifications to the law enforcement agency when responding to such a
43 request; and (4) authorizes the officer to investigate and take any necessary enforcement
44 action within the scope of the request for assistance unless otherwise directed by the
45 requesting law enforcement agency.]
46 Existing law sets forth provisions governing peace officers and provides that certain
47 persons have the powers of or may exercise the powers of a peace officer. (Chapter 289 of
48 NRS) Section 8 of this bill provides that officers [who are employed by a department or
49 division established by a participating political subdivision to] that provide public safety
50 services in accordance with the provisions of section 2 have the powers of a peace officer
51 subject to the provisions of [sections 1 and] section 2.
52 Existing law requires a law enforcement agency to require uniformed peace officers that
53 it employs who routinely interact with the public to wear a portable event recording device
54 while on duty and requires each law enforcement agency to adopt policies and procedures
55 governing the use of portable event recording devices. (NRS 289.830) Section 9 of this bill
56 provides that the term “law enforcement agency” includes for such purposes, in a county
57 whose population is 700,000 or more and in which a metropolitan police department has been
58 organized, the department or division established by the participating political subdivision to
59 provide public safety services.
