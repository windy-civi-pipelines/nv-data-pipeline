AN ACT relating to public safety; providing that certain provisions
governing the organization of a metropolitan police
department do not prohibit a participating political
subdivision from establishing and administering a unit of
specialized law enforcement consisting of officers that
provide public safety services; setting forth the
jurisdiction and authority of officers of such a unit;
revising provisions governing the jurisdiction and
authority of certain units of specialized law enforcement
established in a county in which a metropolitan police
department has been organized; requiring certain officers
of such a unit to wear portable event recording devices;
providing that certain officers of such units have the
powers of a peace officer; providing that such officers are
police officers for purposes of certain provisions

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the board of county commissioners of any county and
2 the governing body of any city or cities located in the county to merge their
3 respective law enforcement agencies into one metropolitan police department and
4 provides that upon merger, the law enforcement agencies of each participating
5 political subdivision, which are designated in the merger, are deemed superseded as
6 long as the ordinance providing for the merger remains in effect. (NRS 280.110,
7 280.120) Existing law provides that such a merger does not prohibit a participating
8 political subdivision from establishing and administering certain units of
9 specialized law enforcement, including a unit consisting of park rangers and a unit
10 consisting of marshals. Existing law further provides that the jurisdiction and
-

– 2 –
11 authority of any such unit is concurrent with the authority and jurisdiction of the
12 metropolitan police department but that the authority and jurisdiction of a unit
13 consisting of marshals or park rangers is limited to certain circumstances. (NRS
14 280.125) Section 2 of this bill includes in the list of such circumstances any
15 purpose authorized in an interlocal or cooperative agreement entered into by the
16 sheriff of the county in which the metropolitan police department is located and the
17 participating political subdivision.
18 Section 2 additionally provides that such a merger does not prohibit a
19 participating political subdivision from establishing and administering a unit
20 consisting of officers that provide public safety services and similarly limits, with
21 certain exceptions, the authority and jurisdiction of such a unit to that of a unit of
22 park rangers or marshals. Sections 3-7 and 10 of this bill make conforming
23 changes to: (1) reflect that the duties of such an officer under such circumstances
24 are coextensive with the duties of such a park ranger or marshal; and (2) make such
25 an officer subject to certain similar requirements as such a park ranger or marshal.
26 Section 11 of this bill provides that such an officer is a “police officer” for
27 purposes of certain provisions relating to occupational diseases.
28 Existing law sets forth provisions governing peace officers and provides that
29 certain persons have the powers of or may exercise the powers of a peace officer.
30 (Chapter 289 of NRS) Section 8 of this bill provides that officers that provide
31 public safety services in accordance with the provisions of section 2 have the
32 powers of a peace officer subject to the provisions of section 2.
33 Existing law requires a law enforcement agency to require uniformed peace
34 officers that it employs who routinely interact with the public to wear a portable
35 event recording device while on duty and requires each law enforcement agency to
36 adopt policies and procedures governing the use of portable event recording
37 devices. (NRS 289.830) Section 9 of this bill provides that the term “law
38 enforcement agency” includes for such purposes, in a county whose population is
39 700,000 or more and in which a metropolitan police department has been
40 organized, the department or division established by the participating political
41 subdivision to provide public safety services.
