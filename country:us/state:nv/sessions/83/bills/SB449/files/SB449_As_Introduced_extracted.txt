AN ACT relating to public safety; providing that certain provisions
governing the organization of a metropolitan police

subdivision from establishing and administering a unit of
specialized law enforcement consisting of officers which
are employed by certain departments or divisions that
provide public safety services; setting forth the
jurisdiction and authority of officers of such a unit;
revising provisions governing the jurisdiction and
authority of certain units of specialized law enforcement
established in a county in which a metropolitan police

providing that certain officers of such units have the
powers of a peace officer; providing that such officers are
police officers for purposes of certain provisions
governing occupational diseases; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the board of county commissioners of any county and
2 the governing body of any city or cities located in the county to merge their
3 respective law enforcement agencies into one metropolitan police department and
4 provides that upon merger, the law enforcement agencies of each participating
5 political subdivision, which are designated in the merger, are deemed superseded as
6 long as the ordinance providing for the merger remains in effect. (NRS 280.110,
7 280.120) Existing law provides that such a merger does not prohibit a participating
8 political subdivision from establishing and administering certain units of
-
*SB449*
– 2 –
9 specialized law enforcement, including a unit consisting of park rangers and a unit
10 consisting of marshals. Existing law further provides that the jurisdiction and
11 authority of any such unit is concurrent with the authority and jurisdiction of the
12 metropolitan police department but that the authority and jurisdiction of a unit
13 consisting of marshals or park rangers is limited to certain circumstances. (NRS
14 280.125) Section 2 of this bill includes, with certain exceptions, in the list of such
15 circumstances, the enforcement of state laws and city and county ordinances within
16 the authority and jurisdiction of the metropolitan police department if the park
17 ranger or marshal reasonably believes that an immediate response is necessary to
18 protect the physical safety of a person or others from an immediate threat of
19 physical injury or to protect against an immediate threat of severe property damage.
20 Section 2 further requires a park ranger or marshal who takes such actions to: (1)
21 immediately notify the primary law enforcement agency that he or she is
22 responding to the threat; and (2) unless otherwise directed by the primary law
23 enforcement agency or an interlocal agreement, investigate and take any
24 enforcement action necessary to protect the physical safety of a person or others
25 from an immediate threat of physical injury or to protect against an immediate
26 threat of severe property damage.
27 Section 2 additionally provides that such a merger does not prohibit a
28 participating political subdivision from establishing and administering a unit
29 consisting of officers of the participating political subdivision which are employed
30 by a department or division established by the participating political subdivision to
31 provide public safety services and similarly limits, with certain exceptions, the
32 authority and jurisdiction of such a unit to that of a unit of park rangers or marshals.
33 Sections 3-7 and 10 of this bill make conforming changes to: (1) reflect that the
34 duties of such an officer under such circumstances are coextensive with the duties
35 of such a park ranger or marshal; and (2) make such an officer subject to certain
36 similar requirements as such a park ranger or marshal. Section 11 of this bill
37 provides that such an officer is a “police officer” for purposes of certain provisions
38 relating to occupational diseases.
39 Section 1: (1) requires, in a county whose population is 700,000 or more
40 (currently only Clark County), a unit consisting of such officers to provide, under
41 certain circumstances, assistance to another law enforcement agency that requests
42 such assistance; (2) provides that the unit is deemed to have the authority and
43 jurisdiction of the law enforcement agency for the purpose of assisting the law
44 enforcement agency; (3) requires an officer of such a unit to provide certain
45 notifications to the law enforcement agency when responding to such a request; and
46 (4) authorizes the officer to investigate and take any necessary enforcement action
47 within the scope of the request for assistance unless otherwise directed by the
48 requesting law enforcement agency.
49 Existing law sets forth provisions governing peace officers and provides that
50 certain persons have the powers of or may exercise the powers of a peace officer.
51 (Chapter 289 of NRS) Section 8 of this bill provides that officers who are
52 employed by a department or division established by a participating political
53 subdivision to provide public services in accordance with the provisions of section
54 2 have the powers of a peace officer subject to the provisions of sections 1 and 2.
55 Existing law requires a law enforcement agency to require uniformed peace
56 officers that it employs who routinely interact with the public to wear a portable
57 event recording device while on duty and requires each law enforcement agency to
58 adopt policies and procedures governing the use of portable event recording
59 devices. (NRS 289.830) Section 9 of this bill provides that the term “law
60 enforcement agency” includes for such purposes, in a county whose population is
61 700,000 or more and in which a metropolitan police department has been
62 organized, the department or division established by the participating political
63 subdivision to provide public safety services.

Raw Text:
S.B. 449
SENATE BILL NO. 449–COMMITTEE ON GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS
MARCH 24, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Government Affairs
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to public safety.
(BDR 22-1030)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public safety; providing that certain provisions
governing the organization of a metropolitan police
department do not prohibit a participating political
subdivision from establishing and administering a unit of
specialized law enforcement consisting of officers which
are employed by certain departments or divisions that
provide public safety services; setting forth the
jurisdiction and authority of officers of such a unit;
revising provisions governing the jurisdiction and
authority of certain units of specialized law enforcement
established in a county in which a metropolitan police
department has been organized; requiring certain officers
of such a unit to wear portable event recording devices;
providing that certain officers of such units have the
powers of a peace officer; providing that such officers are
police officers for purposes of certain provisions
governing occupational diseases; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the board of county commissioners of any county and
2 the governing body of any city or cities located in the county to merge their
3 respective law enforcement agencies into one metropolitan police department and
4 provides that upon merger, the law enforcement agencies of each participating
5 political subdivision, which are designated in the merger, are deemed superseded as
6 long as the ordinance providing for the merger remains in effect. (NRS 280.110,
7 280.120) Existing law provides that such a merger does not prohibit a participating
8 political subdivision from establishing and administering certain units of
-
*SB449*

– 2 –
9 specialized law enforcement, including a unit consisting of park rangers and a unit
10 consisting of marshals. Existing law further provides that the jurisdiction and
11 authority of any such unit is concurrent with the authority and jurisdiction of the
12 metropolitan police department but that the authority and jurisdiction of a unit
13 consisting of marshals or park rangers is limited to certain circumstances. (NRS
14 280.125) Section 2 of this bill includes, with certain exceptions, in the list of such
15 circumstances, the enforcement of state laws and city and county ordinances within
16 the authority and jurisdiction of the metropolitan police department if the park
17 ranger or marshal reasonably believes that an immediate response is necessary to
18 protect the physical safety of a person or others from an immediate threat of
19 physical injury or to protect against an immediate threat of severe property damage.
20 Section 2 further requires a park ranger or marshal who takes such actions to: (1)
21 immediately notify the primary law enforcement agency that he or she is
22 responding to the threat; and (2) unless otherwise directed by the primary law
23 enforcement agency or an interlocal agreement, investigate and take any
24 enforcement action necessary to protect the physical safety of a person or others
25 from an immediate threat of physical injury or to protect against an immediate
26 threat of severe property damage.
27 Section 2 additionally provides that such a merger does not prohibit a
28 participating political subdivision from establishing and administering a unit
29 consisting of officers of the participating political subdivision which are employed
30 by a department or division established by the participating political subdivision to
31 provide public safety services and similarly limits, with certain exceptions, the
32 authority and jurisdiction of such a unit to that of a unit of park rangers or marshals.
33 Sections 3-7 and 10 of this bill make conforming changes to: (1) reflect that the
34 duties of such an officer under such circumstances are coextensive with the duties
35 of such a park ranger or marshal; and (2) make such an officer subject to certain
36 similar requirements as such a park ranger or marshal. Section 11 of this bill
37 provides that such an officer is a “police officer” for purposes of certain provisions
38 relating to occupational diseases.
39 Section 1: (1) requires, in a county whose population is 700,000 or more
40 (currently only Clark County), a unit consisting of such officers to provide, under
41 certain circumstances, assistance to another law enforcement agency that requests
42 such assistance; (2) provides that the unit is deemed to have the authority and
43 jurisdiction of the law enforcement agency for the purpose of assisting the law
44 enforcement agency; (3) requires an officer of such a unit to provide certain
45 notifications to the law enforcement agency when responding to such a request; and
46 (4) authorizes the officer to investigate and take any necessary enforcement action
47 within the scope of the request for assistance unless otherwise directed by the
48 requesting law enforcement agency.
49 Existing law sets forth provisions governing peace officers and provides that
50 certain persons have the powers of or may exercise the powers of a peace officer.
51 (Chapter 289 of NRS) Section 8 of this bill provides that officers who are
52 employed by a department or division established by a participating political
53 subdivision to provide public services in accordance with the provisions of section
54 2 have the powers of a peace officer subject to the provisions of sections 1 and 2.
55 Existing law requires a law enforcement agency to require uniformed peace
56 officers that it employs who routinely interact with the public to wear a portable
57 event recording device while on duty and requires each law enforcement agency to
58 adopt policies and procedures governing the use of portable event recording
59 devices. (NRS 289.830) Section 9 of this bill provides that the term “law
60 enforcement agency” includes for such purposes, in a county whose population is
61 700,000 or more and in which a metropolitan police department has been
62 organized, the department or division established by the participating political
63 subdivision to provide public safety services.
