After an assessment has been made by the association, assessments

forth in NRS 116.31151. Unless the declaration imposes more
stringent standards, the budget must include a budget for the daily
operation of the association and a budget for the reserves required
by paragraph (b) of subsection 2.

Section 9:
2. Except for assessments under subsections 4 to 7, inclusive,

replace or restore are necessary. Notwithstanding any provision of

establish or carry out a funding plan, the executive board may,
without seeking or obtaining the approval of the units’ owners,
impose any necessary and reasonable assessments against the units
in the common-interest community. Any such assessments imposed

the association conducted pursuant to NRS 116.31152.

Section 10:
3. Any assessment for common expenses or installment thereof
that is 60 days or more past due bears interest at a rate equal to the

be made only against the units in the common-interest community at
the time the judgment was entered, in proportion to their liabilities
for common expenses.

Section 13:
6. If damage to a unit or other part of the common-interest
community, or if any other common expense is caused by the willful
misconduct or gross negligence of any unit’s owner, tenant or
-

invitee of a unit’s owner or tenant, the association may assess that

expense, unless the damage or other common expense is caused by a

performing services for, the unit’s owner, tenant or invitee of the
unit’s owner or tenant [.] ; or
(b) An oil stain that is located entirely on the driveway of the

before January 1, 1992, is not required to make an assessment
against a vacant lot located within the community that is owned by
the declarant.

Section 15:
8. If liabilities for common expenses are reallocated,
assessments for common expenses and any installment thereof not
yet due must be recalculated in accordance with the reallocated
liabilities.

Section 16:
9. The association shall provide written notice to each unit’s
owner of a meeting at which an assessment for a capital
improvement is to be considered or action is to be taken on such an
assessment at least 21 calendar days before the date of the meeting.
Sec. 4. NRS 116.350 is hereby amended to read as follows:

Section 17:
116.350 1. In a common-interest community which is not
gated or enclosed and the access to which is not restricted or
controlled by a person or device, the executive board shall not and
the governing documents must not provide for the regulation of any
road, street, alley or other thoroughfare the right-of-way of which is
accepted by the State or a local government for dedication as a road,
street, alley or other thoroughfare for public use.

Section 18:
2. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3, the provisions
of subsection 1 do not preclude an association from adopting, and

governing damages to real property in a unit-owners’
association; prohibiting a unit-owners’ association from
restricting the parking of certain vehicles; requiring certain
notice of termination or assignment of an agreement for the
management of a common-interest community under certain
circumstances; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law requires a unit-owners’ association for a common-interest
community to adopt bylaws and authorizes an association to amend the bylaws and
adopt rules and regulations concerning the community. (NRS 116.3102) Section 1
of this bill prohibits the executive board and governing documents of an association
from requiring a unit’s owner to install landscaping in the back yard of his or her
unit sooner than 24 months after the close of escrow for the initial purchase of the
unit from a declarant. Section 1 further authorizes the executive board and
governing documents of an association to require a unit’s owner to install a thin
layer of rock in the back yard of his or her unit not sooner than 12 months after the
close of escrow for the initial purchase of the unit from a declarant.
Existing law authorizes a unit-owners’ association to charge reasonable fees for
costs associated with collecting any past due obligation. (NRS 116.310313) Section
2 of this bill prohibits an association from: (1) charging any late fee sooner than 30
days after an obligation becomes past due; and (2) reporting any past due obligation
to a reporting agency that assembles or evaluates information concerning credit.
Existing law authorizes a unit-owners’ association to assess a unit’s owner for
certain damages or common expenses. (NRS 116.3115) Section 3 of this bill
prohibits an association from assessing a unit’s owner for an oil stain that is located
entirely on the driveway of the unit’s owner.
Existing law authorizes the governing documents of a unit-owners’ association
to set forth rules that reasonably restrict parking in the common-interest community
and authorizes an association to impose fines for a violation of the governing
documents. Existing law also prohibits an association from restricting the parking
of certain utility service vehicles, law enforcement vehicles and emergency services
vehicles under certain circumstances. (NRS 116.31031, 116.350) Section 4 of this
bill prohibits an association from restricting the parking of certain vehicles
displaying a commercial advertisement, other than vehicles displaying a
commercial advertisement containing a sexual portrayal or depicting an image
relating to the sale of a controlled substance. An association may require such
images to be obscured by a magnet.
Existing law imposes certain requirements relating to agreements for the
management of a common-interest community and requires the Commission for
Common-Interest Communities and Condominium Hotels to adopt regulations
regarding the transfer of all books, records and other papers of a client upon the

[3.] 4. As used in this section:
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 3 –

awarded by a court.
(b) “Obligation” means any assessment, fine, construction

Sec. 3. NRS 116.3115 is hereby amended to read as follows:
116.3115 1. Until the association makes an assessment for
common expenses, the declarant shall pay all common expenses.
After an assessment has been made by the association, assessments
must be made at least annually, based on a budget adopted at least
annually by the association in accordance with the requirements set
forth in NRS 116.31151. Unless the declaration imposes more
stringent standards, the budget must include a budget for the daily
operation of the association and a budget for the reserves required
by paragraph (b) of subsection 2.
2. Except for assessments under subsections 4 to 7, inclusive,
or as otherwise provided in this chapter:
(a) All common expenses, including the reserves, must be
assessed against all the units in accordance with the allocations set
forth in the declaration pursuant to subsections 1 and 2 of
NRS 116.2107.
(b) The association shall establish adequate reserves, funded on
a reasonable basis, for the repair, replacement and restoration of the
major components of the common elements and any other portion of
the common-interest community that the association is obligated to
maintain, repair, replace or restore. The reserves may be used only
for those purposes, including, without limitation, repairing,
replacing and restoring roofs, roads and sidewalks, and must not be
used for daily maintenance. The association may comply with the
provisions of this paragraph through a funding plan that is designed
to allocate the costs for the repair, replacement and restoration of the
major components of the common elements and any other portion of
the common-interest community that the association is obligated to
maintain, repair, replace or restore over a period of years if the
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 4 –
funding plan is designed in an actuarially sound manner which will
ensure that sufficient money is available when the repair,
replacement and restoration of the major components of the
common elements or any other portion of the common-interest
community that the association is obligated to maintain, repair,
replace or restore are necessary. Notwithstanding any provision of
the governing documents to the contrary, to establish adequate
reserves pursuant to this paragraph, including, without limitation, to
establish or carry out a funding plan, the executive board may,
without seeking or obtaining the approval of the units’ owners,
impose any necessary and reasonable assessments against the units
in the common-interest community. Any such assessments imposed
by the executive board must be based on the study of the reserves of
the association conducted pursuant to NRS 116.31152.
3. Any assessment for common expenses or installment thereof
that is 60 days or more past due bears interest at a rate equal to the
prime rate at the largest bank in Nevada as ascertained by the
Commissioner of Financial Institutions on January 1 or July 1, as
the case may be, immediately preceding the date the assessment
becomes past due, plus 2 percent. The rate must be adjusted
accordingly on each January 1 and July 1 thereafter until the balance
is satisfied.
4. Except as otherwise provided in the governing documents:
(a) Any common expense associated with the maintenance,
repair, restoration or replacement of a limited common element
must be assessed against the units to which that limited common
element is assigned, equally, or in any other proportion the
declaration provides;
(b) Any common expense benefiting fewer than all of the units
or their owners, including, without limitation, common expenses
consisting of the payment, on behalf of a unit’s owner, of delinquent
property taxes or utility charges owed by the unit’s owner, may be
assessed exclusively against the units or units’ owners benefited;
and
(c) The costs of insurance must be assessed in proportion to risk
and the costs of utilities must be assessed in proportion to usage.
5. Assessments to pay a judgment against the association may
be made only against the units in the common-interest community at
the time the judgment was entered, in proportion to their liabilities
for common expenses.
6. If damage to a unit or other part of the common-interest
community, or if any other common expense is caused by the willful
misconduct or gross negligence of any unit’s owner, tenant or
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 5 –
invitee of a unit’s owner or tenant, the association may assess that
expense exclusively against his or her unit, even if the association
maintains insurance with respect to that damage or common
expense, unless the damage or other common expense is caused by a
vehicle and is [committed] :
(a) Committed by a person who is delivering goods to, or
performing services for, the unit’s owner, tenant or invitee of the
unit’s owner or tenant [.] ; or
(b) An oil stain that is located entirely on the driveway of the
unit’s owner.
7. The association of a common-interest community created
before January 1, 1992, is not required to make an assessment
against a vacant lot located within the community that is owned by
the declarant.
8. If liabilities for common expenses are reallocated,
assessments for common expenses and any installment thereof not
yet due must be recalculated in accordance with the reallocated
liabilities.
9. The association shall provide written notice to each unit’s
owner of a meeting at which an assessment for a capital
improvement is to be considered or action is to be taken on such an
assessment at least 21 calendar days before the date of the meeting.
Sec. 4. NRS 116.350 is hereby amended to read as follows:
116.350 1. In a common-interest community which is not
gated or enclosed and the access to which is not restricted or
controlled by a person or device, the executive board shall not and
the governing documents must not provide for the regulation of any
road, street, alley or other thoroughfare the right-of-way of which is
accepted by the State or a local government for dedication as a road,
street, alley or other thoroughfare for public use.
2. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3, the provisions
of subsection 1 do not preclude an association from adopting, and
do not preclude the governing documents of an association from
setting forth, rules that reasonably restrict the parking or storage of
recreational vehicles, watercraft, trailers or commercial vehicles in
the common-interest community to the extent authorized by law.
The governing documents of an association may authorize the
executive board of the association to impose a fine pursuant to
NRS 116.31031 for any violation of the rules authorized pursuant to
this subsection.
