4 of this bill prohibits the executive board and governing documents of an association
5 from requiring a unit’s owner to install landscaping in the back yard of his or her
6 unit sooner than 36 months after the close of escrow for the initial purchase of the
7 unit. Section 1 further authorizes the executive board and governing documents of
8 an association to require a unit’s owner to install a thin layer of rock in the back
9 yard of his or her unit not sooner than 18 months after the close of escrow for the
10 initial purchase of the unit.

16 Existing law authorizes a unit-owners’ association to assess a unit’s owner for
17 certain damages or common expenses. (NRS 116.3115) Section 3 of this bill
18 prohibits an association from assessing a unit’s owner for an oil stain that is located
19 entirely on the driveway of the unit’s owner.
20 Existing law authorizes the governing documents of a unit-owners’ association
21 to set forth rules that reasonably restrict parking in the common-interest community
22 and authorizes an association to impose fines for a violation of the governing
23 documents. Existing law also prohibits an association from restricting the parking
24 of certain utility service vehicles, law enforcement vehicles and emergency services
25 vehicles under certain circumstances. (NRS 116.31031, 116.350) Section 4 of this
26 bill prohibits an association from restricting the parking of certain vehicles
27 displaying a commercial advertisement, other than vehicles displaying a
28 commercial advertisement containing a sexual portrayal or depicting an image
29 relating to the sale of a controlled substance. An association may require such
30 images to be obscured by a magnet.
31 Existing law imposes certain requirements relating to agreements for the
32 management of a common-interest community and requires the Commission for
33 Common-Interest Communities and Condominium Hotels to adopt regulations
34 regarding the transfer of all books, records and other papers of a client upon the
35 termination or assignment of such an agreement. (NRS 116A.620) Section 5 of this
36 bill requires, with certain exceptions, the association to provide notice of the
37 termination of an agreement to be posted within the common elements of an
38 association and provided by electronic mail to all units’ owners who have provided
39 the association with an electronic mail address.

8 itself or by any person acting on behalf of the association, including,
9 without limitation, an officer or employee of the association, a
10 community manager or a collection agency.
11 [3.] 4. As used in this section:

14 filing fee, recording fee, fee related to the preparation, recording or
15 delivery of a lien or lien rescission, title search lien fee, bankruptcy
16 search fee, referral fee, fee for postage or delivery and any other fee

26 Sec. 3. NRS 116.3115 is hereby amended to read as follows:
27 116.3115 1. Until the association makes an assessment for
28 common expenses, the declarant shall pay all common expenses.
29 After an assessment has been made by the association, assessments
30 must be made at least annually, based on a budget adopted at least
31 annually by the association in accordance with the requirements set
32 forth in NRS 116.31151. Unless the declaration imposes more
33 stringent standards, the budget must include a budget for the daily
34 operation of the association and a budget for the reserves required
35 by paragraph (b) of subsection 2.
36 2. Except for assessments under subsections 4 to 7, inclusive,
37 or as otherwise provided in this chapter:
38 (a) All common expenses, including the reserves, must be
39 assessed against all the units in accordance with the allocations set
40 forth in the declaration pursuant to subsections 1 and 2 of
41 NRS 116.2107.
42 (b) The association shall establish adequate reserves, funded on
43 a reasonable basis, for the repair, replacement and restoration of the
44 major components of the common elements and any other portion of
45 the common-interest community that the association is obligated to
-
*SB121_R1*

– 4 –
1 maintain, repair, replace or restore. The reserves may be used only
2 for those purposes, including, without limitation, repairing,
3 replacing and restoring roofs, roads and sidewalks, and must not be
4 used for daily maintenance. The association may comply with the
5 provisions of this paragraph through a funding plan that is designed
6 to allocate the costs for the repair, replacement and restoration of the
7 major components of the common elements and any other portion of
8 the common-interest community that the association is obligated to
9 maintain, repair, replace or restore over a period of years if the
10 funding plan is designed in an actuarially sound manner which will
11 ensure that sufficient money is available when the repair,
12 replacement and restoration of the major components of the
13 common elements or any other portion of the common-interest
14 community that the association is obligated to maintain, repair,
15 replace or restore are necessary. Notwithstanding any provision of
16 the governing documents to the contrary, to establish adequate
17 reserves pursuant to this paragraph, including, without limitation, to
18 establish or carry out a funding plan, the executive board may,
19 without seeking or obtaining the approval of the units’ owners,
20 impose any necessary and reasonable assessments against the units
21 in the common-interest community. Any such assessments imposed
22 by the executive board must be based on the study of the reserves of
23 the association conducted pursuant to NRS 116.31152.
24 3. Any assessment for common expenses or installment thereof
25 that is 60 days or more past due bears interest at a rate equal to the
26 prime rate at the largest bank in Nevada as ascertained by the
27 Commissioner of Financial Institutions on January 1 or July 1, as
28 the case may be, immediately preceding the date the assessment
29 becomes past due, plus 2 percent. The rate must be adjusted
30 accordingly on each January 1 and July 1 thereafter until the balance
31 is satisfied.
32 4. Except as otherwise provided in the governing documents:
33 (a) Any common expense associated with the maintenance,
34 repair, restoration or replacement of a limited common element
35 must be assessed against the units to which that limited common
36 element is assigned, equally, or in any other proportion the
37 declaration provides;
38 (b) Any common expense benefiting fewer than all of the units
39 or their owners, including, without limitation, common expenses
40 consisting of the payment, on behalf of a unit’s owner, of delinquent
41 property taxes or utility charges owed by the unit’s owner, may be
42 assessed exclusively against the units or units’ owners benefited;
43 and
44 (c) The costs of insurance must be assessed in proportion to risk
45 and the costs of utilities must be assessed in proportion to usage.

1 5. Assessments to pay a judgment against the association may
2 be made only against the units in the common-interest community at
3 the time the judgment was entered, in proportion to their liabilities
4 for common expenses.
5 6. If damage to a unit or other part of the common-interest
6 community, or if any other common expense is caused by the willful
7 misconduct or gross negligence of any unit’s owner, tenant or
8 invitee of a unit’s owner or tenant, the association may assess that
9 expense exclusively against his or her unit, even if the association
10 maintains insurance with respect to that damage or common
11 expense, unless the damage or other common expense is caused by a
12 vehicle and is [committed] :
13 (a) Committed by a person who is delivering goods to, or
14 performing services for, the unit’s owner, tenant or invitee of the
15 unit’s owner or tenant [.] ; or
16 (b) An oil stain that is located entirely on the driveway of the
17 unit’s owner.
18 7. The association of a common-interest community created
19 before January 1, 1992, is not required to make an assessment
20 against a vacant lot located within the community that is owned by
21 the declarant.
22 8. If liabilities for common expenses are reallocated,
23 assessments for common expenses and any installment thereof not
24 yet due must be recalculated in accordance with the reallocated
25 liabilities.
26 9. The association shall provide written notice to each unit’s
27 owner of a meeting at which an assessment for a capital
28 improvement is to be considered or action is to be taken on such an
29 assessment at least 21 calendar days before the date of the meeting.
30 Sec. 4. NRS 116.350 is hereby amended to read as follows:
31 116.350 1. In a common-interest community which is not
32 gated or enclosed and the access to which is not restricted or
33 controlled by a person or device, the executive board shall not and

35 road, street, alley or other thoroughfare the right-of-way of which is
36 accepted by the State or a local government for dedication as a road,
37 street, alley or other thoroughfare for public use.
38 2. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3, the provisions
39 of subsection 1 do not preclude an association from adopting, and

41 setting forth, rules that reasonably restrict the parking or storage of
42 recreational vehicles, watercraft, trailers or commercial vehicles in
