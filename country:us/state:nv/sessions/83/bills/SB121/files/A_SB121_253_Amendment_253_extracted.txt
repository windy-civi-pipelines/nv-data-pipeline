AN ACT relating to common-interest communities; prohibiting a unit-owners’

landscaping under certain circumstances; revising provisions
governing the collection of past due obligations by a unit-owners’
association; revising provisions governing damages to real property in
a unit-owners’ association; prohibiting a unit-owners’ association from

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires a unit-owners’ association for a common-interest community to
2 adopt bylaws and authorizes an association to amend the bylaws and adopt rules and
3 regulations concerning the community. (NRS 116.3102) Section 1 of this bill prohibits the
4 executive board and governing documents of an association from requiring a unit’s owner to
5 install landscaping in the back yard of his or her unit sooner than 36 months after the close of
6 escrow for the initial purchase of the unit. Section 1 further authorizes the executive board
7 and governing documents of an association to require a unit’s owner to install a thin layer of
8 rock in the back yard of his or her unit not sooner than 18 months after the close of escrow for
9 the initial purchase of the unit.
10 Existing law authorizes a unit-owners’ association to charge reasonable fees for costs
11 associated with collecting any past due obligation. (NRS 116.310313) Section 2 of this bill
12 prohibits an association from: (1) charging any late fee sooner than 30 days after an obligation
13 becomes past due; and (2) reporting any past due obligation to a reporting agency that
14 assembles or evaluates information concerning credit.
15 Existing law authorizes a unit-owners’ association to assess a unit’s owner for certain
16 damages or common expenses. (NRS 116.3115) Section 3 of this bill prohibits an association
17 from assessing a unit’s owner for an oil stain that is [not] located entirely on the driveway of
18 the unit’s owner.
19 Existing law authorizes the governing documents of a unit-owners’ association to set
20 forth rules that reasonably restrict parking in the common-interest community and authorizes
21 an association to impose fines for a violation of the governing documents. Existing law also
22 prohibits an association from restricting the parking of certain utility service vehicles, law
Senate Amendment No. 253 to Senate Bill No. 121 Page 4
23 enforcement vehicles and emergency services vehicles under certain circumstances. (NRS
24 116.31031, 116.350) Section 4 of this bill prohibits an association from restricting the parking
25 of certain vehicles displaying a commercial advertisement, other than vehicles displaying a
26 commercial advertisement containing a sexual portrayal or depicting an image relating to the
27 sale of a controlled substance. An association may require such images to be obscured by a
28 magnet.
29 Existing law imposes certain requirements relating to agreements for the management of
30 a common-interest community and requires the Commission for Common-Interest
31 Communities and Condominium Hotels to adopt regulations regarding the transfer of all
32 books, records and other papers of a client upon the termination or assignment of such an
33 agreement. (NRS 116A.620) Section 5 of this bill requires, with certain exceptions, the
34 association to provide notice of the termination of an agreement to be posted within the
35 common elements of an association and provided by electronic mail to all units’ owners who
36 have provided the association with an electronic mail address.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 116 of NRS is hereby amended by adding thereto a new
2 section to read as follows:
3 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2, the executive board of an
4 association and the governing documents of that association may not require a
5 unit’s owner to install landscaping in the back yard of his or her unit sooner than
6 36 months after the close of escrow for the initial purchase of the unit.
7 2. The executive board of an association and the governing documents of
8 that association may require a unit’s owner to install a thin layer of rock in the
9 back yard of his or her unit not sooner than 18 months after the close of escrow
10 for the initial purchase of the unit.
11 Sec. 2. NRS 116.310313 is hereby amended to read as follows:
12 116.310313 1. [An] Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2, an
13 association may charge a unit’s owner reasonable fees to cover the costs of
14 collecting any past due obligation. The Commission shall adopt regulations
15 establishing the amount of the fees that an association may charge pursuant to this
16 section.
17 2. An association may not:
18 (a) Charge a unit’s owner a late fee sooner than 30 days after any obligation
19 becomes past due.
20 (b) Report any past due obligation to a reporting agency that assembles or
21 evaluates information concerning credit.
22 3. The provisions of this section apply to any costs of collecting a past due
23 obligation charged to a unit’s owner, regardless of whether the past due obligation
24 is collected by the association itself or by any person acting on behalf of the
25 association, including, without limitation, an officer or employee of the association,
26 a community manager or a collection agency.
27 [3.] 4. As used in this section:
28 (a) “Costs of collecting” includes any fee, charge or cost, by whatever name,
29 including, without limitation, any collection fee, filing fee, recording fee, fee
30 related to the preparation, recording or delivery of a lien or lien rescission, title
31 search lien fee, bankruptcy search fee, referral fee, fee for postage or delivery and
32 any other fee or cost that an association charges a unit’s owner for the investigation,
33 enforcement or collection of a past due obligation. The term does not include any
34 costs incurred by an association if a lawsuit is filed to enforce any past due
35 obligation or any costs awarded by a court.
Senate Amendment No. 253 to Senate Bill No. 121 Page 5
1 (b) “Obligation” means any assessment, fine, construction penalty, fee, charge
2 or interest levied or imposed against a unit’s owner pursuant to any provision of
3 this chapter or the governing documents.
4 Sec. 3. NRS 116.3115 is hereby amended to read as follows:
5 116.3115 1. Until the association makes an assessment for common
6 expenses, the declarant shall pay all common expenses. After an assessment has
7 been made by the association, assessments must be made at least annually, based on
8 a budget adopted at least annually by the association in accordance with the
9 requirements set forth in NRS 116.31151. Unless the declaration imposes more
10 stringent standards, the budget must include a budget for the daily operation of the
11 association and a budget for the reserves required by paragraph (b) of subsection 2.
12 2. Except for assessments under subsections 4 to 7, inclusive, or as otherwise
13 provided in this chapter:
14 (a) All common expenses, including the reserves, must be assessed against all
15 the units in accordance with the allocations set forth in the declaration pursuant to
16 subsections 1 and 2 of NRS 116.2107.
17 (b) The association shall establish adequate reserves, funded on a reasonable
18 basis, for the repair, replacement and restoration of the major components of the
19 common elements and any other portion of the common-interest community that
20 the association is obligated to maintain, repair, replace or restore. The reserves may
21 be used only for those purposes, including, without limitation, repairing, replacing
22 and restoring roofs, roads and sidewalks, and must not be used for daily
23 maintenance. The association may comply with the provisions of this paragraph
24 through a funding plan that is designed to allocate the costs for the repair,
25 replacement and restoration of the major components of the common elements and
26 any other portion of the common-interest community that the association is
27 obligated to maintain, repair, replace or restore over a period of years if the funding
28 plan is designed in an actuarially sound manner which will ensure that sufficient
29 money is available when the repair, replacement and restoration of the major
30 components of the common elements or any other portion of the common-interest
31 community that the association is obligated to maintain, repair, replace or restore
32 are necessary. Notwithstanding any provision of the governing documents to the
33 contrary, to establish adequate reserves pursuant to this paragraph, including,
34 without limitation, to establish or carry out a funding plan, the executive board
35 may, without seeking or obtaining the approval of the units’ owners, impose any
36 necessary and reasonable assessments against the units in the common-interest
37 community. Any such assessments imposed by the executive board must be based
38 on the study of the reserves of the association conducted pursuant to NRS
39 116.31152.
40 3. Any assessment for common expenses or installment thereof that is 60 days
41 or more past due bears interest at a rate equal to the prime rate at the largest bank in
42 Nevada as ascertained by the Commissioner of Financial Institutions on January 1
43 or July 1, as the case may be, immediately preceding the date the assessment
44 becomes past due, plus 2 percent. The rate must be adjusted accordingly on each
45 January 1 and July 1 thereafter until the balance is satisfied.
46 4. Except as otherwise provided in the governing documents:
47 (a) Any common expense associated with the maintenance, repair, restoration
48 or replacement of a limited common element must be assessed against the units to
49 which that limited common element is assigned, equally, or in any other proportion
50 the declaration provides;
51 (b) Any common expense benefiting fewer than all of the units or their owners,
52 including, without limitation, common expenses consisting of the payment, on
53 behalf of a unit’s owner, of delinquent property taxes or utility charges owed by the
Senate Amendment No. 253 to Senate Bill No. 121 Page 6
1 unit’s owner, may be assessed exclusively against the units or units’ owners
2 benefited; and
3 (c) The costs of insurance must be assessed in proportion to risk and the costs
4 of utilities must be assessed in proportion to usage.
5 5. Assessments to pay a judgment against the association may be made only
6 against the units in the common-interest community at the time the judgment was
7 entered, in proportion to their liabilities for common expenses.
8 6. If damage to a unit or other part of the common-interest community, or if
9 any other common expense is caused by the willful misconduct or gross negligence
10 of any unit’s owner, tenant or invitee of a unit’s owner or tenant, the association
11 may assess that expense exclusively against his or her unit, even if the association
12 maintains insurance with respect to that damage or common expense, unless the
13 damage or other common expense is caused by a vehicle and is [committed] :
14 (a) Committed by a person who is delivering goods to, or performing services
15 for, the unit’s owner, tenant or invitee of the unit’s owner or tenant [.] ; or
16 (b) An oil stain that is [not] located entirely on the driveway of the unit’s
17 owner.
18 7. The association of a common-interest community created before January 1,
19 1992, is not required to make an assessment against a vacant lot located within the
20 community that is owned by the declarant.
21 8. If liabilities for common expenses are reallocated, assessments for common
22 expenses and any installment thereof not yet due must be recalculated in
23 accordance with the reallocated liabilities.
24 9. The association shall provide written notice to each unit’s owner of a
25 meeting at which an assessment for a capital improvement is to be considered or
26 action is to be taken on such an assessment at least 21 calendar days before the date
27 of the meeting.
28 Sec. 4. NRS 116.350 is hereby amended to read as follows:
29 116.350 1. In a common-interest community which is not gated or enclosed
30 and the access to which is not restricted or controlled by a person or device, the
31 executive board shall not and the governing documents must not provide for the
32 regulation of any road, street, alley or other thoroughfare the right-of-way of which
33 is accepted by the State or a local government for dedication as a road, street, alley
34 or other thoroughfare for public use.
35 2. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3, the provisions of subsection
36 1 do not preclude an association from adopting, and do not preclude the governing
37 documents of an association from setting forth, rules that reasonably restrict the
38 parking or storage of recreational vehicles, watercraft, trailers or commercial
39 vehicles in the common-interest community to the extent authorized by law. The
40 governing documents of an association may authorize the executive board of the
41 association to impose a fine pursuant to NRS 116.31031 for any violation of the
42 rules authorized pursuant to this subsection.
43 3. In any common-interest community, the executive board shall not and the
44 governing documents must not prohibit a person from:

15 (c) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, parking a vehicle having
16 a gross vehicle weight of less than 10,000 pounds that contains a commercial
17 advertisement in an area designated for parking for visitors, in a designated
18 parking area or common parking area or on the driveway of his or her unit. An
19 association may not require the owner of such a vehicle to cover any commercial
20 advertisement, other than an advertisement containing a sexual portrayal or an
21 image relating to the sale of a controlled substance. An association may require
22 the owner to use a magnet to obscure any commercial advertisement containing
23 such images.
24 4. An association may require that a person parking a utility service vehicle,
25 law enforcement vehicle or emergency services vehicle as set forth in paragraph
26 (a) or (b) of subsection 3 provide written confirmation from his or her employer
27 that the person is qualified to park his or her vehicle in the manner set forth in
28 subsection 3.

AN ACT relating to common-interest communities; prohibiting a unit-owners’
association for a common-interest community from requiring
landscaping under certain circumstances; revising provisions
governing the collection of past due obligations by a unit-owners’
association; revising provisions governing damages to real property in
a unit-owners’ association; prohibiting a unit-owners’ association from
restricting the parking of certain vehicles; requiring certain notice of

common-interest community under certain circumstances; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires a unit-owners’ association for a common-interest community to
2 adopt bylaws and authorizes an association to amend the bylaws and adopt rules and
3 regulations concerning the community. (NRS 116.3102) Section 1 of this bill prohibits the
4 executive board and governing documents of an association from requiring a unit’s owner to
5 install landscaping in the back yard of his or her unit sooner than 36 months after the close of
6 escrow for the initial purchase of the unit. Section 1 further authorizes the executive board
7 and governing documents of an association to require a unit’s owner to install a thin layer of
8 rock in the back yard of his or her unit not sooner than 18 months after the close of escrow for
9 the initial purchase of the unit.
10 Existing law authorizes a unit-owners’ association to charge reasonable fees for costs
11 associated with collecting any past due obligation. (NRS 116.310313) Section 2 of this bill
12 prohibits an association from: (1) charging any late fee sooner than 30 days after an obligation
13 becomes past due; and (2) reporting any past due obligation to a reporting agency that
14 assembles or evaluates information concerning credit.
15 Existing law authorizes a unit-owners’ association to assess a unit’s owner for certain
16 damages or common expenses. (NRS 116.3115) Section 3 of this bill prohibits an association
17 from assessing a unit’s owner for an oil stain that is [not] located entirely on the driveway of
18 the unit’s owner.
19 Existing law authorizes the governing documents of a unit-owners’ association to set
20 forth rules that reasonably restrict parking in the common-interest community and authorizes
21 an association to impose fines for a violation of the governing documents. Existing law also
22 prohibits an association from restricting the parking of certain utility service vehicles, law

Senate Amendment No. 253 to Senate Bill No. 121 Page 4
23 enforcement vehicles and emergency services vehicles under certain circumstances. (NRS
24 116.31031, 116.350) Section 4 of this bill prohibits an association from restricting the parking
25 of certain vehicles displaying a commercial advertisement, other than vehicles displaying a
26 commercial advertisement containing a sexual portrayal or depicting an image relating to the
27 sale of a controlled substance. An association may require such images to be obscured by a
28 magnet.
29 Existing law imposes certain requirements relating to agreements for the management of
30 a common-interest community and requires the Commission for Common-Interest
31 Communities and Condominium Hotels to adopt regulations regarding the transfer of all
32 books, records and other papers of a client upon the termination or assignment of such an
33 agreement. (NRS 116A.620) Section 5 of this bill requires, with certain exceptions, the
34 association to provide notice of the termination of an agreement to be posted within the
35 common elements of an association and provided by electronic mail to all units’ owners who
36 have provided the association with an electronic mail address.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 116 of NRS is hereby amended by adding thereto a new
2 section to read as follows:
3 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2, the executive board of an
4 association and the governing documents of that association may not require a
5 unit’s owner to install landscaping in the back yard of his or her unit sooner than
6 36 months after the close of escrow for the initial purchase of the unit.
7 2. The executive board of an association and the governing documents of
8 that association may require a unit’s owner to install a thin layer of rock in the
9 back yard of his or her unit not sooner than 18 months after the close of escrow
10 for the initial purchase of the unit.
11 Sec. 2. NRS 116.310313 is hereby amended to read as follows:
12 116.310313 1. [An] Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2, an
13 association may charge a unit’s owner reasonable fees to cover the costs of
14 collecting any past due obligation. The Commission shall adopt regulations
15 establishing the amount of the fees that an association may charge pursuant to this
16 section.
17 2. An association may not:
18 (a) Charge a unit’s owner a late fee sooner than 30 days after any obligation
19 becomes past due.
20 (b) Report any past due obligation to a reporting agency that assembles or
21 evaluates information concerning credit.
22 3. The provisions of this section apply to any costs of collecting a past due
23 obligation charged to a unit’s owner, regardless of whether the past due obligation
24 is collected by the association itself or by any person acting on behalf of the
25 association, including, without limitation, an officer or employee of the association,
26 a community manager or a collection agency.
27 [3.] 4. As used in this section:
28 (a) “Costs of collecting” includes any fee, charge or cost, by whatever name,
29 including, without limitation, any collection fee, filing fee, recording fee, fee
30 related to the preparation, recording or delivery of a lien or lien rescission, title
31 search lien fee, bankruptcy search fee, referral fee, fee for postage or delivery and
32 any other fee or cost that an association charges a unit’s owner for the investigation,
33 enforcement or collection of a past due obligation. The term does not include any
34 costs incurred by an association if a lawsuit is filed to enforce any past due
35 obligation or any costs awarded by a court.

Senate Amendment No. 253 to Senate Bill No. 121 Page 5
1 (b) “Obligation” means any assessment, fine, construction penalty, fee, charge
2 or interest levied or imposed against a unit’s owner pursuant to any provision of
3 this chapter or the governing documents.
4 Sec. 3. NRS 116.3115 is hereby amended to read as follows:
5 116.3115 1. Until the association makes an assessment for common
6 expenses, the declarant shall pay all common expenses. After an assessment has
7 been made by the association, assessments must be made at least annually, based on
8 a budget adopted at least annually by the association in accordance with the
9 requirements set forth in NRS 116.31151. Unless the declaration imposes more
10 stringent standards, the budget must include a budget for the daily operation of the
11 association and a budget for the reserves required by paragraph (b) of subsection 2.
12 2. Except for assessments under subsections 4 to 7, inclusive, or as otherwise
13 provided in this chapter:
14 (a) All common expenses, including the reserves, must be assessed against all
15 the units in accordance with the allocations set forth in the declaration pursuant to
16 subsections 1 and 2 of NRS 116.2107.
17 (b) The association shall establish adequate reserves, funded on a reasonable
18 basis, for the repair, replacement and restoration of the major components of the
19 common elements and any other portion of the common-interest community that
20 the association is obligated to maintain, repair, replace or restore. The reserves may
21 be used only for those purposes, including, without limitation, repairing, replacing
22 and restoring roofs, roads and sidewalks, and must not be used for daily
23 maintenance. The association may comply with the provisions of this paragraph
24 through a funding plan that is designed to allocate the costs for the repair,
25 replacement and restoration of the major components of the common elements and
26 any other portion of the common-interest community that the association is
27 obligated to maintain, repair, replace or restore over a period of years if the funding
28 plan is designed in an actuarially sound manner which will ensure that sufficient
29 money is available when the repair, replacement and restoration of the major
30 components of the common elements or any other portion of the common-interest
31 community that the association is obligated to maintain, repair, replace or restore
32 are necessary. Notwithstanding any provision of the governing documents to the
33 contrary, to establish adequate reserves pursuant to this paragraph, including,
34 without limitation, to establish or carry out a funding plan, the executive board
35 may, without seeking or obtaining the approval of the units’ owners, impose any
36 necessary and reasonable assessments against the units in the common-interest
37 community. Any such assessments imposed by the executive board must be based
38 on the study of the reserves of the association conducted pursuant to NRS
39 116.31152.
40 3. Any assessment for common expenses or installment thereof that is 60 days
41 or more past due bears interest at a rate equal to the prime rate at the largest bank in
42 Nevada as ascertained by the Commissioner of Financial Institutions on January 1
43 or July 1, as the case may be, immediately preceding the date the assessment
44 becomes past due, plus 2 percent. The rate must be adjusted accordingly on each
45 January 1 and July 1 thereafter until the balance is satisfied.
46 4. Except as otherwise provided in the governing documents:
47 (a) Any common expense associated with the maintenance, repair, restoration
48 or replacement of a limited common element must be assessed against the units to
49 which that limited common element is assigned, equally, or in any other proportion
50 the declaration provides;
51 (b) Any common expense benefiting fewer than all of the units or their owners,
52 including, without limitation, common expenses consisting of the payment, on
53 behalf of a unit’s owner, of delinquent property taxes or utility charges owed by the

Senate Amendment No. 253 to Senate Bill No. 121 Page 6
1 unit’s owner, may be assessed exclusively against the units or units’ owners
2 benefited; and
3 (c) The costs of insurance must be assessed in proportion to risk and the costs
4 of utilities must be assessed in proportion to usage.
5 5. Assessments to pay a judgment against the association may be made only
6 against the units in the common-interest community at the time the judgment was
7 entered, in proportion to their liabilities for common expenses.
8 6. If damage to a unit or other part of the common-interest community, or if
9 any other common expense is caused by the willful misconduct or gross negligence
10 of any unit’s owner, tenant or invitee of a unit’s owner or tenant, the association
11 may assess that expense exclusively against his or her unit, even if the association
12 maintains insurance with respect to that damage or common expense, unless the
13 damage or other common expense is caused by a vehicle and is [committed] :
14 (a) Committed by a person who is delivering goods to, or performing services
15 for, the unit’s owner, tenant or invitee of the unit’s owner or tenant [.] ; or
16 (b) An oil stain that is [not] located entirely on the driveway of the unit’s
17 owner.
18 7. The association of a common-interest community created before January 1,
19 1992, is not required to make an assessment against a vacant lot located within the
20 community that is owned by the declarant.
21 8. If liabilities for common expenses are reallocated, assessments for common
22 expenses and any installment thereof not yet due must be recalculated in
23 accordance with the reallocated liabilities.
24 9. The association shall provide written notice to each unit’s owner of a
25 meeting at which an assessment for a capital improvement is to be considered or
26 action is to be taken on such an assessment at least 21 calendar days before the date
27 of the meeting.
28 Sec. 4. NRS 116.350 is hereby amended to read as follows:
29 116.350 1. In a common-interest community which is not gated or enclosed
30 and the access to which is not restricted or controlled by a person or device, the
31 executive board shall not and the governing documents must not provide for the
32 regulation of any road, street, alley or other thoroughfare the right-of-way of which
33 is accepted by the State or a local government for dedication as a road, street, alley
34 or other thoroughfare for public use.
35 2. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3, the provisions of subsection
36 1 do not preclude an association from adopting, and do not preclude the governing
37 documents of an association from setting forth, rules that reasonably restrict the
38 parking or storage of recreational vehicles, watercraft, trailers or commercial
39 vehicles in the common-interest community to the extent authorized by law. The
40 governing documents of an association may authorize the executive board of the
41 association to impose a fine pursuant to NRS 116.31031 for any violation of the
42 rules authorized pursuant to this subsection.
43 3. In any common-interest community, the executive board shall not and the
44 governing documents must not prohibit a person from:

9 (2) In an area designated for parking for visitors, in a designated parking
10 area or common parking area, or on the driveway of his or her unit, if the person is:

13 employment with the entity which owns the vehicle for the purpose of responding
14 to requests for law enforcement services or emergency services [.] ; or
15 (c) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, parking a vehicle having
16 a gross vehicle weight of less than 10,000 pounds that contains a commercial
17 advertisement in an area designated for parking for visitors, in a designated
18 parking area or common parking area or on the driveway of his or her unit. An
19 association may not require the owner of such a vehicle to cover any commercial
20 advertisement, other than an advertisement containing a sexual portrayal or an
21 image relating to the sale of a controlled substance. An association may require
22 the owner to use a magnet to obscure any commercial advertisement containing
23 such images.
24 4. An association may require that a person parking a utility service vehicle,
25 law enforcement vehicle or emergency services vehicle as set forth in paragraph
26 (a) or (b) of subsection 3 provide written confirmation from his or her employer
27 that the person is qualified to park his or her vehicle in the manner set forth in
28 subsection 3.

41 (d) “Utility service vehicle” means any motor vehicle:
42 (1) Used in the furtherance of repairing, maintaining or operating any
