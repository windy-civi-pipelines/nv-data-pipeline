Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of physician assistants in
2 this State by the Board of Medical Examiners and the State Board of Osteopathic
3 Medicine. (NRS 630.271-630.2755, 633.432-633.469) Section 1 of this bill enacts
4 the PA Licensure Compact, which allows a person who is licensed as a physician
5 assistant in a state that is a member of the Compact to practice as a physician
6 assistant in other states that are members of the Compact. In order to practice as a
7 physician assistant under the Compact, the Compact requires a physician assistant
8 to: (1) have graduated from certain programs for the education of physician
9 assistants; (2) hold current certification issued by the National Commission on
10 Certification of Physician Assistants; (3) have no felony or misdemeanor
11 convictions; (4) have never had a license, permit or registration relating to
12 controlled substances suspended or revoked; (5) have a unique identifier, as
13 prescribed by the PA Licensure Compact Commission, a joint public body

– 2 –
14 established by the Compact; (6) hold an unrestricted license in his or her home
15 state; (7) currently have no limitations or restrictions on his or her license and have
16 had no adverse actions taken against any license or authority to practice under the
17 Compact within the previous 2 years, with certain exceptions; (8) notify the
18 Commission that he or she is seeking to practice under the Compact in another
19 state; (9) pay any applicable fees; (10) meet any requirement in the state in which
20 he or she seeks to practice under the Compact to pass an assessment of his or her
21 knowledge of the applicable laws and rules of that state; and (11) report any
22 adverse action taken against him or her within 30 days after the date the adverse
23 action is taken.
24 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of nurses in this State.
25 (Chapter 632 of NRS) Section 10 of this bill enacts the Nurse Licensure Compact,
26 which allows a person who is licensed as a nurse in a state that is a party to the
27 Compact to obtain a multistate license to practice as a nurse in other states that are
28 parties to the Compact. The Compact regulates the licensure and discipline of
29 nurses who hold multistate licenses through the Compact. To obtain a multistate
30 license, the Compact requires a nurse to: (1) meet the qualifications of his or her
31 home state for licensure; (2) graduate from or be eligible to graduate from a
32 registered nurse or licensed practical/vocational nurse program; (3) pass an English
33 proficiency examination if the applicant is a graduate of a foreign prelicensure
34 education program not taught in English or if English is not the applicant’s native
35 language; (4) pass an NCLEX-RN or NCLEX-PN examination; (5) hold or be
36 eligible to hold an active license in his or her home state; (6) undergo a fingerprint
37 or other biometric-based criminal background check; (7) not have been convicted
38 or found guilty of a felony or a misdemeanor offense related to nursing; (8) not be
39 currently enrolled in certain monitoring programs; (9) disclose to the licensing
40 authority in his or her home state whether he or she is participating in such a
41 program; and (10) have a valid social security number.
42 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of audiologists and
43 speech-language pathologists in this State. (Chapter 637B of NRS) Section 21 of
44 this bill enacts the Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology Interstate Compact,
45 which allows a person who is licensed as an audiologist or speech-language
46 pathologist in a state that is a member of the Compact to practice as an audiologist
47 or speech-language pathologist in other states that are members of the Compact. In
48 order to practice as an audiologist or speech-language pathologist under the
49 Compact, the Compact requires an audiologist or speech-language pathologist to:
50 (1) hold a license in his or her home state; (2) have no encumbrances on his or her
51 license; (3) meet certain other requirements for eligibility; (4) have had no adverse
52 actions taken against any license or authority to practice under the Compact within
53 the previous 2 years; (5) notify the Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology
54 Compact Commission, a joint public body established by the Compact, that he or
55 she is seeking to practice under the Compact in another state; (6) pay any
56 applicable fees; and (7) report any adverse action taken against him or her within
57 30 days after the date the adverse action is taken. The Compact additionally
58 requires a member state to recognize the right of an audiologist or speech-language
59 pathologist who is licensed by any member state to practice audiology or speech-
60 language pathology, as applicable, through telehealth in any member state under
61 conditions prescribed by the Commission.
62 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of physical therapists and
63 physical therapist assistants in this State. (Chapter 640 of NRS) Section 23 of this
64 bill enacts the Physical Therapy Licensure Compact, which allows a person who is
65 licensed as a physical therapist or physical therapist assistant in a state that is a
66 member of the Compact to practice as a physical therapist or physical therapist
67 assistant in other states that are members of the Compact. In order to practice as a
68 physical therapist or physical therapist assistant under the Compact, the Compact
-
*SB34*

– 3 –
69 requires a physical therapist or physical therapist assistant to: (1) hold a license in
70 his or her home state; (2) have no encumbrances on his or her license; (3) meet
71 certain other requirements for eligibility; (4) have had no adverse actions taken
72 against any license or authority to practice under the Compact within the previous 2
73 years; (5) notify the Physical Therapy Compact Commission, a joint public body
74 established by the Compact, that he or she is seeking to practice under the Compact
75 in another state; (6) pay any applicable fees; (7) meet any requirements in the state
76 in which he or she seeks to practice under the Compact; and (8) report any adverse
77 action taken against him or her within 30 days after the date the adverse action is
78 taken.
79 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of occupational therapists
80 and occupational therapy assistants in this State. (Chapter 640A of NRS) Section
81 26 of this bill enacts the Occupational Therapy Licensure Compact, which allows a
82 person who is licensed as an occupational therapist or occupational therapy
83 assistant in a state that is a member of the Compact to practice as an occupational
84 therapist or occupational therapy assistant in other states that are members of the
85 Compact. In order to practice as an occupational therapist or occupational therapy
86 assistant under the Compact, the Compact requires an occupational therapist or
87 occupational therapy assistant to: (1) hold a license in his or her home state; (2)
88 have a valid social security number or National Practitioner Identification number;
89 (3) have no encumbrances on his or her license; (4) meet certain other requirements
90 for eligibility; (5) have had no adverse actions taken against any license or authority
91 to practice under the Compact within the previous 2 years; (6) notify the
92 Occupational Therapy Compact Commission, a joint public body established by the
93 Compact, that he or she is seeking to practice under the Compact in another state;
94 (7) pay any applicable fees; (8) complete a fingerprint or other biometric-based
95 criminal background check; (9) meet any requirement in the state in which he or
96 she seeks to practice under the Compact to pass an assessment of his or her
97 knowledge of the applicable laws and rules of that state; and (10) report any
98 adverse action taken against him or her within 30 days after the date the adverse
99 action is taken.
100 Each interstate compact adopted by sections 1, 10, 21, 23 and 26 authorizes a
101 member state to take adverse action against a provider of health care who is
102 practicing in the member state under the Compact. Each such interstate compact
103 authorizes the commission created by the compact to levy and collect assessments
104 from party states to cover the cost of its operations. Each such compact also creates
105 a data system to facilitate the sharing of information among member states.
106 Sections 8, 9, 11, 12, 18, 20, 22, 24 and 27 of this bill generally authorize the
107 Board of Medical Examiners, the State Board of Nursing, the State Board of
108 Osteopathic Medicine, the Speech-Language Pathology, Audiology and Hearing
109 Aid Dispensing Board, the Nevada Physical Therapy Board and the Board of
110 Occupational Therapy to disclose information to those data systems when required
111 by those compacts. Sections 1, 10, 21, 23, 26 and 33 of this bill provide for the
112 confidentiality of certain information disclosed through a data system.
113 Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to reflect that the PA
114 Licensure Compact will be placed in the same chapter as the Interstate Medical
115 Licensure Compact, which relates to physicians. Sections 4 and 14 of this bill
116 define “PA Licensure Compact” to refer to the PA Licensure Compact for the
117 purposes of provisions governing allopathic and osteopathic medicine. Sections 6
118 and 16 of this bill indicate the applicability of those definitions. Sections 5 and 15
119 of this bill prescribe the conditions under which the Board of Medical Examiners or
120 the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine will regulate a physician assistant
121 practicing in this State under the PA Licensure Compact.
122 Section 28 of this bill deems practicing as a physician assistant, audiologist,
123 speech-language pathologist, physical therapist, physical therapist assistant,
-
*SB34*

– 4 –
124 occupational therapist or occupational therapy assistant under the Compact to be
125 equivalent to practicing under a license issued by the applicable professional
126 licensing board, thereby providing such persons with the same authority, duties and
127 legal protections as a licensee. Because the Nurse Licensure Compact enacted by
128 section 10 requires a nurse practicing under the Nurse Licensure Compact to obtain
129 a multistate license, such a nurse would be licensed pursuant to provisions of law
130 governing nursing and would thus also have the same authority as any other nurse
131 who is licensed to practice in this State. Sections 7 and 17 of this bill further clarify
132 that a physician assistant practicing in this State under the PA Licensure Compact
133 has the same legal status as a physician assistant licensed by the Board of Medical
134 Examiners or the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine. Sections 19 and 25 of this
135 bill require an osteopathic physician assistant or physical therapist practicing under
136 the Compact to display proof that he or she is authorized to practice under the
137 Compact in the same manner as a licensed osteopathic physician assistant or
138 licensed physical therapist, as applicable, is required to display his or her license.
139 Sections 29-32, 34-36 and 39 of this bill replace the term “registered physical
140 therapist” with the term “licensed physical therapist” to reflect current terminology
141 used in existing law governing the practice of physical therapy and this bill.
142 Sections 37 and 38 of this bill make further revisions to clarify that physician
143 assistants licensed by the Board of Medical Examiners or the State Board of
144 Osteopathic Medicine and physician assistants practicing in this State under the PA
145 Licensure Compact have the same authority with regard to prescribing, dispensing,
146 administering and possessing controlled substances and dangerous drugs.
147 Section 40 of this bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services
148 to: (1) study the potential impacts of the interstate compacts ratified and entered
149 into in sections 1, 10, 21, 23 and 26 on the availability of relevant health care
150 services in this State; and (2) report the results of the study to the Patient Protection
151 Commission and the Legislature.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 629A of NRS is hereby amended by
2 adding thereto a new section to read as follows:
3 The PA Licensure Compact is hereby ratified and entered into
4 with all other jurisdictions legally joining the Compact, in
5 substantially the form set forth in this section:
6 PA LICENSURE COMPACT
7
8 SECTION 1. PURPOSE
9
10 In order to strengthen access to Medical Services, and in
11 recognition of the advances in the delivery of Medical Services,
12 the Participating States of the PA Licensure Compact have allied
13 in common purpose to develop a comprehensive process that
14 complements the existing authority of State Licensing Boards to
15 license and discipline PAs and seeks to enhance the portability of
16 a License to practice as a PA while safeguarding the safety of
17 patients. This Compact allows Medical Services to be provided by
-
*SB34*

– 5 –
1 PAs, via the mutual recognition of the Licensee’s Qualifying
2 License by other Compact Participating States. This Compact also
3 adopts the prevailing standard for PA licensure and affirms that
4 the practice and delivery of Medical Services by the PA occurs
5 where the patient is located at the time of the patient encounter,
6 and therefore requires the PA to be under the jurisdiction of the
7 State Licensing Board where the patient is located. State Licensing
8 Boards that participate in this Compact retain the jurisdiction to
9 impose Adverse Action against a Compact Privilege in that State
10 issued to a PA through the procedures of this Compact. The PA
11 Licensure Compact will alleviate burdens for military families by
12 allowing active duty military personnel and their spouses to obtain
13 a Compact Privilege based on having an unrestricted License in
14 good standing from a Participating State.

1 Board in a Participating State for the attendance and testimony of
2 witnesses or the production of evidence from another Participating
3 State shall be enforced in the latter State by any court of

14 4. Nothing in this Compact authorizes a Participating State
15 to impose discipline against a PA’s Compact Privilege or to deny
16 an application for a Compact Privilege in that Participating State
17 for the individual’s otherwise lawful practice in another State.
18 C. For purposes of taking Adverse Action, the Participating
19 State which issued the Qualifying License shall give the same
20 priority and effect to reported conduct received from any other
21 Participating State as it would if the conduct had occurred within
22 the Participating State which issued the Qualifying License. In so
23 doing, that Participating State shall apply its own State laws to
24 determine appropriate action.
25 D. A Participating State, if otherwise permitted by State law,
26 may recover from the affected PA the costs of investigations and
27 disposition of cases resulting from any Adverse Action taken

44 have been removed from the State License. All disciplinary orders
45 by the Participating State which issued the Qualifying License that
-

1 impose Adverse Action against a PA’s License shall include a
2 Statement that the PA’s Compact Privilege is deactivated in all
3 Participating States during the pendency of the order.
4 H. If any Participating State takes Adverse Action, it
5 promptly shall notify the administrator of the Data System.

10 A. The Participating States hereby create and establish a joint
11 government agency and national administrative body known as

15 existence on or after the effective date of the Compact as set forth
16 in Section 11.A.
17 B. Membership, Voting, and Meetings
18 1. Each Participating State shall have and be limited to one

34 the claim is made had a reasonable basis for believing occurred
35 within the scope of Commission employment, duties or
36 responsibilities; provided that nothing in this paragraph shall be
37 construed to protect any such person from suit or liability for any

28 liability of any Licensee for professional malpractice or
29 misconduct, which shall be governed solely by any other
30 applicable State laws.
31 6. Nothing herein shall be construed to designate the venue
32 or jurisdiction to bring actions for alleged acts of malpractice,

11 the date specified by the Commission for each Rule.
12 B. The Commission shall promulgate reasonable Rules in
13 order to effectively and efficiently implement and administer this
14 Compact and achieve its purposes. A Commission Rule shall be
15 invalid and have not force or effect only if a court of competent

25 the Rules of the Commission shall be ineffective in that State to
26 the extent of the conflict.
27 D. If a majority of the legislatures of the Participating States
28 rejects a Commission Rule, by enactment of a statute or resolution
29 in the same manner used to adopt this Compact within four (4)
30 years of the date of adoption of the Rule, then such Rule shall
31 have no further force and effect in any Participating State or to
32 any State applying to participate in the Compact.

34 meeting of the Commission.
35 F. Prior to promulgation and adoption of a final Rule or
36 Rules by the Commission, and at least thirty (30) days in advance

23 the Commission of their desire to appear and testify at the hearing.
24 2. Hearings shall be conducted in a manner providing each
25 person who wishes to comment a fair and reasonable opportunity
26 to comment orally or in writing.

28 and the written comments, data, facts, opinions, and arguments
29 received in response to the proposed rulemaking shall be made
30 available to a person upon request.

36 consider all written and oral comments timely received.
37 K. The Commission shall, by majority vote of all delegates,

2 explanation of the reasons for substantive changes made to the
3 proposed Rule as well as reasons for substantive changes not

6 date for the Rule. Except for an emergency as provided in
7 subsection L, the effective date of the Rule shall be no sooner than
8 thirty (30) days after the Commission issued the notice that it

10 L. Upon determination that an emergency exists, the
11 Commission may consider and adopt an emergency Rule with

13 comment, or hearing, provided that the usual rulemaking
14 procedures provided in this Compact and in this section shall be
15 retroactively applied to the Rule as soon as reasonably possible, in
16 no event later than ninety (90) days after the effective date of the
17 Rule. For the purposes of this provision, an emergency Rule is one
18 that must be adopted immediately by the Commission in order to:
19 1. Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or
20 welfare;
21 2. Prevent a loss of Commission or Participating State
22 funds;

31 Commission. The revision shall be subject to challenge by any
32 person for a period of thirty (30) days after posting. The revision

38 challenged, the revision may not take effect without the approval
39 of the Commission.

41 apply under this Compact.

1 SECTION 10. OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION,
2 AND ENFORCEMENT
3
4 A. Oversight
5 1. The executive and judicial branches of State government
6 in each Participating State shall enforce this Compact and take all
7 actions necessary and appropriate to implement the Compact.
8 2. Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or against
9 the Commission shall be brought solely and exclusively in a court
10 of competent jurisdiction where the principal office of the
11 Commission is located. The Commission may waive venue and
12 jurisdictional defenses to the extent it adopts or consents to
13 participate in alternative dispute resolution proceedings. Nothing
14 herein shall affect or limit the selection or propriety of venue in
15 any action against a licensee for professional malpractice,
16 misconduct or any such similar matter.
17 3. The Commission shall be entitled to receive service of
18 process in any proceeding regarding the enforcement or
19 interpretation of the Compact or the Commission’s Rules and
20 shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all
21 purposes. Failure to provide the Commission with service of
22 process shall render a judgment or order in such proceeding void
23 as to the Commission, this Compact, or Commission Rules.
24 B. Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination
25 1. If the Commission determines that a Participating State
26 has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or
27 responsibilities under this Compact or the Commission Rules, the
28 Commission shall provide written notice to the defaulting State
29 and other Participating States. The notice shall describe the
30 default, the proposed means of curing the default and any other
31 action that the Commission may take and shall offer remedial
32 training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.
33 2. If a State in default fails to cure the default, the
34 defaulting State may be terminated from this Compact upon an
35 affirmative vote of a majority of the delegates of the Participating
36 States, and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this
37 Compact upon such State may be terminated on the effective date
38 of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending
39 State of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of
40 default.
41 3. Termination of participation in this Compact shall be
42 imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have
43 been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be
44 given by the Commission to the governor, the majority and
-
*SB34*

– 23 –
1 minority leaders of the defaulting State’s legislature, and to the
2 Licensing Board(s) of each of the Participating States.
3 4. A State that has been terminated is responsible for all
4 assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the
5 effective date of termination, including obligations that extend
6 beyond the effective date of termination.
7 5. The Commission shall not bear any costs related to a
8 State that is found to be in default or that has been terminated
9 from this Compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the
10 Commission and the defaulting State.
11 6. The defaulting State may appeal its termination from the
12 Compact by the Commission by petitioning the U.S. District Court
13 for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the
14 Commission has its principal offices. The prevailing member shall
15 be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable
16 attorney’s fees.
17 7. Upon the termination of a State’s participation in the
18 Compact, the State shall immediately provide notice to all
19 Licensees within that State of such termination:
20 a. Licensees who have been granted a Compact
21 Privilege in that State shall retain the Compact Privilege for one
22 hundred eighty (180) days following the effective date of such
23 termination.

32 would be with respect to a State seeking to participate in the
33 Compact, a material departure from the Compact. Otherwise, if
34 this Compact shall be held to be contrary to the constitution of any
35 Participating State, the Compact shall remain in full force and
36 effect as to the remaining Participating States and in full force
37 and effect as to the Participating State affected as to all severable
38 matters.

7 section:
8
9 INTERSTATE MEDICAL LICENSURE COMPACT
10
11 ARTICLE 1. PURPOSE
12
13 In order to strengthen access to health care, and in recognition of
14 the advances in the delivery of health care, the member states of the
15 Interstate Medical Licensure Compact have allied in common
16 purpose to develop a comprehensive process that complements the
17 existing licensing and regulatory authority of state medical boards
18 and provides a streamlined process which allows physicians to
19 become licensed in multiple states, thereby enhancing the portability
20 of a medical license and ensuring the safety of patients. The
21 Compact creates another pathway for licensure and does not
22 otherwise change a state’s existing Medical Practice Act. The
23 Compact also adopts the prevailing standard for licensure and
24 affirms that the practice of medicine occurs where the patient is
25 located at the time of the physician-patient encounter, and therefore,
26 requires the physician to be under the jurisdiction of the state
27 medical board where the patient is located. State medical boards that
28 participate in the Compact retain the jurisdiction to impose an
29 adverse action against a license to practice medicine in that state
30 issued to a physician through the procedures in the Compact.
31

35 in lieu of discipline, or suspended, then all licenses issued to the
36 physician by member boards shall automatically be placed, without
37 further action necessary by any member board, on the same status. If
38 the member board in the state of principal license subsequently

12 member board shall be suspended, automatically and immediately
13 without further action necessary by the other member board, for 90
14 days upon entry of the order by the disciplining board, to permit the
15 member board to investigate the basis for the action under the
16 Medical Practice Act of that state. A member board may terminate
17 the automatic suspension of the license it issued prior to the
18 completion of the 90 day suspension period in a manner consistent
19 with the Medical Practice Act of that state.

35 (d) The Interstate Commission shall consist of two voting
36 representatives appointed by each member state who shall serve as
37 Commissioners. In states where allopathic and osteopathic

33 3. The expanded mobility of nurses and the use of
34 advanced communication technologies as part of our nation’s
35 health care delivery system require greater coordination and
36 cooperation among states in the areas of nurse licensure and
37 regulation;
38 4. New practice modalities and technology make
39 compliance with individual state nurse licensure laws difficult and
40 complex;
41 5. The current system of duplicative licensure for nurses
42 practicing in multiple states is cumbersome and redundant for
43 both nurses and states; and
44 6. Uniformity of nurse licensure requirements throughout
45 the states promotes public safety and public health benefits.

1 b. The general purposes of this Compact are to:
2 1. Facilitate the states’ responsibility to protect the
3 public’s health and safety;
4 2. Ensure and encourage the cooperation of party states in
5 the areas of nurse licensure and regulation;
6 3. Facilitate the exchange of information between party
7 states in the areas of nurse regulation, investigation and adverse

9 4. Promote compliance with the laws governing the
10 practice of nursing in each jurisdiction;
11 5. Invest all party states with the authority to hold a nurse
12 accountable for meeting all state practice laws in the state in
13 which the patient is located at the time care is rendered through
14 the mutual recognition of party state licenses;
15 6. Decrease redundancies in the consideration and
16 issuance of nurse licenses; and
17 7. Provide opportunities for interstate practice by nurses
18 who meet uniform licensure requirements.

8 submission of fingerprints or other biometric-based information
9 by applicants for the purpose of obtaining an applicant’s criminal
10 history record information from the Federal Bureau of
11 Investigation and the agency responsible for retaining that state’s
12 criminal records.

3 APPLICATIONS FOR LICENSURE IN A PARTY STATE
4
5 a. Upon application for a multistate license, the licensing
6 board in the issuing party state shall ascertain, through the
7 coordinated licensure information system, whether the applicant
8 has ever held, or is the holder of, a license issued by any other
9 state, whether there are any encumbrances on any license or
10 multistate licensure privilege held by the applicant, whether any
11 adverse action has been taken against any license or multistate
12 licensure privilege held by the applicant and whether the applicant
13 is currently participating in an alternative program.
14 b. A nurse may hold a multistate license, issued by the home
15 state, in only one party state at a time.
16 c. If a nurse changes primary state of residence by moving
17 between two party states, the nurse must apply for licensure in the
18 new home state, and the multistate license issued by the prior
19 home state will be deactivated in accordance with applicable rules
20 adopted by the Commission.
21 1. The nurse may apply for licensure in advance of a
22 change in primary state of residence.
23 2. A multistate license shall not be issued by the new home
24 state until the nurse provides satisfactory evidence of a change in
25 primary state of residence to the new home state and satisfies all
26 applicable requirements to obtain a multistate license from the
27 new home state.
28 d. If a nurse changes primary state of residence by moving
29 from a party state to a non-party state, the multistate license issued
30 by the prior home state will convert to a single-state license, valid
31 only in the former home state.

35 ADDITIONAL AUTHORITIES INVESTED IN
36 PARTY STATE LICENSING BOARDS
37
38 a. In addition to the other powers conferred by state law, a

40 1. Take adverse action against a nurse’s multistate
41 licensure privilege to practice within that party state.
42 i. Only the home state shall have the power to take
43 adverse action against a nurse’s license issued by the home state.
44 ii. For purposes of taking adverse action, the home
45 state licensing board shall give the same priority and effect to
-
*SB34*

– 53 –
1 reported conduct received from a remote state as it would if such
2 conduct had occurred within the home state. In so doing, the
3 home state shall apply its own state laws to determine appropriate
4 action.
5 2. Issue cease and desist orders or impose an
6 encumbrance on a nurse’s authority to practice within that party
7 state.
8 3. Complete any pending investigations of a nurse who
9 changes primary state of residence during the course of such
10 investigations. The licensing board shall also have the authority to
11 take appropriate action(s) and shall promptly report the
12 conclusions of such investigations to the administrator of the
13 coordinated licensure information system. The administrator of
14 the coordinated licensure information system shall promptly notify
15 the new home state of any such actions.
16 4. Issue subpoenas for both hearings and investigations
17 that require the attendance and testimony of witnesses, as well as
18 the production of evidence. Subpoenas issued by a licensing board
19 in a party state for the attendance and testimony of witnesses or
20 the production of evidence from another party state shall be
21 enforced in the latter state by any court of competent jurisdiction,
22 according to the practice and procedure of that court applicable to
23 subpoenas issued in proceedings pending before it. The issuing
24 authority shall pay any witness fees, travel expenses, mileage and
25 other fees required by the service statutes of the state in which the
26 witnesses or evidence are located.
27 5. Obtain and submit, for each nurse licensure applicant,
28 fingerprint or other biometric-based information to the Federal
29 Bureau of Investigation for criminal background checks, receive
30 the results of the Federal Bureau of Investigation record search
31 on criminal background checks and use the results in making
32 licensure decisions.
33 6. If otherwise permitted by state law, recover from the
34 affected nurse the costs of investigations and disposition of cases
35 resulting from any adverse action taken against that nurse.
36 7. Take adverse action based on the factual findings of the
37 remote state, provided that the licensing board follows its own
38 procedures for taking such adverse action.
39 b. If adverse action is taken by the home state against a
40 nurse’s multistate license, the nurse’s multistate licensure
41 privilege to practice in all other party states shall be deactivated
42 until all encumbrances have been removed from the multistate
43 license. All home state disciplinary orders that impose adverse
44 action against a nurse’s multistate license shall include a
-
*SB34*

– 54 –
1 statement that the nurse’s multistate licensure privilege is
2 deactivated in all party states during the pendency of the order.
3 c. Nothing in this Compact shall override a party state’s
4 decision that participation in an alternative program may be used
5 in lieu of adverse action. The home state licensing board shall
6 deactivate the multistate licensure privilege under the multistate
7 license of any nurse for the duration of the nurse’s participation
8 in an alternative program.

12 COORDINATED LICENSURE INFORMATION SYSTEM
13 AND EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION
14
15 a. All party states shall participate in a coordinated licensure
16 information system of all licensed registered nurses (RNs) and
17 licensed practical/vocational nurses (LPNs/VNs). This system will
18 include information on the licensure and disciplinary history of
19 each nurse, as submitted by party states, to assist in the
20 coordination of nurse licensure and enforcement efforts.
21 b. The Commission, in consultation with the administrator of
22 the coordinated licensure information system, shall formulate
23 necessary and proper procedures for the identification, collection
24 and exchange of information under this Compact.
25 c. All licensing boards shall promptly report to the
26 coordinated licensure information system any adverse action, any
27 current significant investigative information, denials of
28 applications (with the reasons for such denials) and nurse
29 participation in alternative programs known to the licensing board
30 regardless of whether such participation is deemed nonpublic or
31 confidential under state law.
32 d. Current significant investigative information and
33 participation in nonpublic or confidential alternative programs
34 shall be transmitted through the coordinated licensure
35 information system only to party state licensing boards.
36 e. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all party state
37 licensing boards contributing information to the coordinated
38 licensure information system may designate information that may
39 not be shared with non-party states or disclosed to other entities or
40 individuals without the express permission of the contributing
41 state.
42 f. Any personally identifiable information obtained from the
43 coordinated licensure information system by a party state licensing
44 board shall not be shared with non-party states or disclosed to
-
*SB34*

– 55 –
1 other entities or individuals except to the extent permitted by the
2 laws of the party state contributing the information.
3 g. Any information contributed to the coordinated licensure
4 information system that is subsequently required to be expunged
5 by the laws of the party state contributing that information shall
6 also be expunged from the coordinated licensure information
7 system.
8 h. The Compact administrator of each party state shall
9 furnish a uniform data set to the Compact administrator of each
10 other party state, which shall include, at a minimum:
11 1. Identifying information;
12 2. Licensure data;

25 responsibilities or actions of the Commission, and shall have

15 state that is found to be in default or whose membership in this

17 between the Commission and the defaulting state.
18 6. The defaulting state may appeal the action of the
19 Commission by petitioning the U.S. District Court for the District
20 of Columbia or the federal district in which the Commission has
21 its principal offices. The prevailing party shall be awarded all
22 costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorneys’ fees.
23 c. Dispute Resolution
24 1. Upon request by a party state, the Commission shall
25 attempt to resolve disputes related to the Compact that arise
26 among party states and between party and non-party states.
27 2. The Commission shall promulgate a rule providing for
28 both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes, as
29 appropriate.
30 3. In the event the Commission cannot resolve disputes
31 among party states arising under this Compact:
32 i. The party states may submit the issues in dispute to
33 an arbitration panel, which will be comprised of individuals
34 appointed by the Compact administrator in each of the affected
35 party states and an individual mutually agreed upon by the
36 Compact administrators of all the party states involved in the
37 dispute.
38 ii. The decision of a majority of the arbitrators shall be
39 final and binding.
40 d. Enforcement
41 1. The Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its
42 discretion, shall enforce the provisions and rules of this Compact.
43 2. By majority vote, the Commission may initiate legal
44 action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the
45 federal district in which the Commission has its principal offices
-

2 the provisions of this Compact and its promulgated rules and
3 bylaws. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and
4 damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the
5 prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation,
6 including reasonable attorneys’ fees.
7 3. The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies
8 of the Commission. The Commission may pursue any other
9 remedies available under federal or state law.

39 affirmative vote of a majority of the member states, and all rights,
40 privileges and benefits conferred by this Compact may be
41 terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the
42 default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or

45 imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have
-
*SB34*

– 105 –

3 minority leaders of the defaulting state’s legislature, and each of

14 Commission by petitioning the U.S. District Court for the District

18 C. Dispute Resolution
19 1. Upon request by a member state, the Commission shall
20 attempt to resolve disputes related to the Compact that arise
21 among member states and between member and non-member

24 both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as

32 principal offices against a member state in default to enforce

34 promulgated rules and bylaws. The relief sought may include both
35 injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is
36 necessary, the prevailing member shall be awarded all costs of
37 such litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees.
38 3. The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies
39 of the Commission. The Commission may pursue any other
40 remedies available under federal or state law.

16 3. The Commission shall be entitled to receive service of
17 process in any such proceeding, and shall have standing to

35 affirmative vote of a majority of the Member States, and all rights,

39 liabilities incurred during the period of default.
40 3. Termination of membership in the Compact shall be
41 imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have
42 been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be

28 principal offices against a Member State in default to enforce

30 promulgated Rules and bylaws. The relief sought may include
31 both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial
32 enforcement is necessary, the prevailing member shall be awarded
33 all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees.
34 3. The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies
35 of the Commission. The Commission may pursue any other
36 remedies available under federal or State law.

10 Commission shall have the full force and effect of law on the day

13 enacting a statute repealing the same.
14 1. A Member State’s withdrawal shall not take effect until

30 SECTION 13. CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
31

41 the constitution of any Member State, the Compact shall remain in
42 full force and effect as to the remaining Member States and in full
43 force and effect as to the Member State affected as to all severable
44 matters.

6 4. In entering a judgment ordering the payment of future
7 damages by periodic payments pursuant to subsection 3, the court
8 shall make a specific finding as to the dollar amount of periodic
9 payments that will compensate the judgment creditor for such future
10 damages. As a condition to authorizing periodic payments of future
11 damages, the court shall require a judgment debtor who is not
12 adequately insured to post security adequate to assure full payment
13 of such damages awarded by the judgment. Upon termination of
14 periodic payments of future damages, the court shall order the return
15 of this security, or so much as remains, to the judgment debtor.
16 5. A judgment ordering the payment of future damages by
17 periodic payments entered pursuant to subsection 3 must specify the
18 recipient or recipients of the payments, the dollar amount of the
19 payments, the interval between payments, and the number of
20 payments or the period of time over which payments will be made.
21 Such payments must only be subject to modification in the event of
22 the death of the judgment creditor. Money damages awarded for loss
23 of future earnings must not be reduced or payments terminated by
24 reason of the death of the judgment creditor, but must be paid to
25 persons to whom the judgment creditor owed a duty of support, as
26 provided by law, immediately before the judgment creditor’s death.
27 In such cases, the court that rendered the original judgment may,
28 upon petition of any party in interest, modify the judgment to award
29 and apportion the unpaid future damages in accordance with this
30 subsection.
31 6. If the court finds that the judgment debtor has exhibited a
32 continuing pattern of failing to make the periodic payments as
33 specified pursuant to subsection 5, the court shall find the judgment
34 debtor in contempt of court and, in addition to the required periodic
35 payments, shall order the judgment debtor to pay the judgment
36 creditor all damages caused by the failure to make such periodic
37 payments, including, but not limited to, court costs and attorney’s
38 fees.
39 7. Following the occurrence or expiration of all obligations
40 specified in the periodic payment judgment, any obligation of the
41 judgment debtor to make further payments ceases and any security
42 given pursuant to subsection 4 reverts to the judgment debtor.

4 rights of a person in any written book or record which is
5 copyrighted pursuant to federal law.
6 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record
7 which is copyrighted solely because it is copyrighted.
8 3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a
9 public book or record shall not deny a request made pursuant to
10 subsection 1 to inspect or copy or receive a copy of a public book or
11 record on the basis that the requested public book or record contains

22 (a) The public record:
23 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
24 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
25 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by

28 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential
29 and that cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from
30 information that is not otherwise confidential.
31 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who
32 has legal custody or control of a public record:
33 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the

35 already prepared or would prefer to provide the copy in a different
36 medium.
37 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon
38 request, prepare the copy of the public record and shall not require
39 the person who has requested the copy to prepare the copy himself
40 or herself.
