Assembly Bill No. 367–Committee on
Legislative Operations and Elections
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to elections; setting forth certain language access
requirements relating to elections; requiring the Secretary of
State to employ a language access coordinator; providing that
a registered voter with a physical disability may use a mobile
device to access interpretive services; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Under existing law, each voting system used by a county or city is required to
provide voting materials in English and every language in which voting materials
are required to be prepared pursuant to federal law. (52 U.S.C. § 10503; NRS
293.2699) Section 5 of this bill requires the Secretary of State to ensure that voting
materials and other elections information are posted on the Internet website of the
Office of the Secretary of State in certain languages. Section 4 of this bill defines
the term “voting materials.” Section 11 of this bill applies that definition to the
provisions of existing law relating to elections.
Section 6 of this bill requires the Secretary of State to establish a toll-free
telephone number which may be used by any person to receive language
interpretation or assistance with translation relating to an election.
Section 9 of this bill requires the Secretary of State to employ a person to serve
as the language access coordinator for the Office of the Secretary of State, who is in
the classified service of the State.
Existing law provides that, with certain exceptions, any registered voter who by
reason of a physical disability or an inability to read or write English is unable to
mark a ballot or use any voting device without assistance is entitled to assistance
from a consenting person of his or her own choice. (NRS 293.296) Section 16 of
this bill provides that a registered voter with a physical disability may also use a
mobile device to access interpretive services to assist him or her in casting a vote in
an election. Such interpretive services include, without limitation, interpretive
services using American Sign Language.
