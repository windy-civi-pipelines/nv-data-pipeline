Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, each voting system used by a county or city is required to provide
2 voting materials in English and every language in which voting materials are required to be
3 prepared pursuant to federal law. (52 U.S.C. § 10503; NRS 293.2699) Section 5 of this bill
4 requires the Secretary of State to ensure that voting materials and other elections information
5 are posted [or made available at a polling place or] on [certain] the Internet [websites]
6 website of the Office of the Secretary of State in certain languages. Section [5 further
7 requires the Secretary of State, on or before January 1 of each odd-numbered year, to review
8 certain data on persons who are members of a minority group and are of limited-English
Assembly Amendment No. 382 to Assembly Bill No. 367 Page 4
9 proficiency in the State. Based on the review of such data, section 5 requires the Secretary of
10 State and certain county and city clerks, under certain circumstances, to ensure that voting
11 materials and other information are provided in certain other languages. Sections 13-15, 17-
12 19, 21, 22 and 28-31 of this bill make changes to require that certain information and voting
13 materials be made available in such languages. Section 42 of this bill requires the Secretary of
14 State to review such data in sufficient time for information and voting materials to be made
15 available for the 2026 General Election.
16 Sections 2-4] 4 of this bill [, respectively, define] defines the [terms “limited-English
17 proficiency,” “minority group” and] term “voting materials.” Section 11 of this bill applies
18 [these definitions] that definition to the provisions of existing law relating to elections.
19 Section 6 of this bill requires the Secretary of State [and authorizes a county clerk] to
20 establish a toll-free telephone number which may be used by any person to receive language
21 interpretation or assistance with translation relating to an election. [Sections 7, 17-19, 21, 25,
22 29 and 30 of this bill require that each polling place, sample ballot and Internet website of the
23 Secretary of State or county or city clerk, as applicable, include the toll-free telephone
24 number.
25 Section 8 of this bill requires the Secretary of State to include on all forms for an

36 a physical disability or an inability to read or write English is unable to mark a ballot or use
37 any voting device without assistance is entitled to assistance from a consenting person of his
38 or her own choice. (NRS 293.296) Section 16 of this bill provides that a registered voter with
39 a physical disability may also use a mobile device to access interpretive services to assist him
40 or her in casting a vote in an election. Such interpretive services include, without limitation,
41 interpretive services using American Sign Language.
42 [Under existing law, the Secretary of State is required to prescribe forms for applications
43 to preregister or register to vote. (NRS 293.507) Section 20 of this bill requires the Secretary
44 of State to include on each such application a line on which an applicant may enter voluntarily
45 the applicant’s state or country of birth and language preference. Section 23 of this bill
46 requires such information to be included on the statewide voter registration list, if it is
47 provided by the applicant.
48 Under existing law, the Secretary of State is required to establish a user-friendly system
49 on the Internet website of the Office of the Secretary of State to allow persons by computer to
50 preregister and register to vote, cancel such preregistration or registration, update such
51 preregistration or registration and determine at what polling place or places he or she is
52 entitled to vote. (NRS 293.671) Section 22 requires the system to also be accessible in each
53 language in which the Secretary of State is required to provide information and voting
54 materials pursuant to section 5.
55 Section 24 of this bill provides that if the mechanical voting system used in a county or
56 city is capable of providing a registered voter’s ballot in the preferred language of the voter
57 other than English, the county or city clerk, as applicable, shall ensure that the list of offices
58 and candidates and the statement of ballot measures for which the voter is entitled to vote is in
59 that preferred language.
60 Section 37 of this bill creates the Language Access Advisory Committee within the
61 Office of the Secretary of State, consisting of the Secretary of State or his or her designee, and
62 certain other members. Sections 35 and 36 of this bill define “Advisory Committee” and
63 “language access programs” for the purposes of sections 34-39 of this bill. Section 38 requires
64 the Advisory Committee to: (1) identify certain programs and services that address language
65 accessibility of elections and voting materials; (2) coordinate with community organizations
66 to determine needs relating to language accessibility of elections and voting materials; (3) act

71 Committee. Section 41 of this bill: (1) requires the Secretary of State to appoint the initial
72 members of the Advisory Committee before January 1, 2026; and (2) staggers the terms of the
73 initial members.
74 Sections 5 and 40 of this bill require that the cost of ensuring that voting materials and
75 other elections information are posted or made available at a polling place in certain languages
76 be paid from the Reserve for Statutory Contingency Account.
77 Existing law authorizes, under certain circumstances, the governing body of a city to
78 conduct a city election in which all ballots must be cast by mail. If such an election is
79 conducted, certain existing provisions of law relating to early voting do not apply to the
80 election. (NRS 293C.112) Section 26 of this bill provides that the provisions of section 25
81 also do not apply to such a city election.
82 Section 32 of this bill makes a conforming change to make the provisions of section 7
83 apply to a presidential preference primary election.]

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to elections; setting forth certain language access requirements
relating to elections; requiring the Secretary of State to employ a
language access coordinator; [requiring the Secretary of State to
include certain information related to a registered voter’s preferred
language on an application to register to vote; requiring county and city
clerks to make a good faith effort to appoint election board officers
who are bilingual;] providing that a registered voter with a physical

certain circumstances, a mechanical voting system to list offices,
candidates and ballot measures in a voter’s preferred language;
creating and setting forth the membership and duties of the Language
Access Advisory Committee;] and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, each voting system used by a county or city is required to provide
2 voting materials in English and every language in which voting materials are required to be
3 prepared pursuant to federal law. (52 U.S.C. § 10503; NRS 293.2699) Section 5 of this bill
4 requires the Secretary of State to ensure that voting materials and other elections information
5 are posted [or made available at a polling place or] on [certain] the Internet [websites]
6 website of the Office of the Secretary of State in certain languages. Section [5 further
7 requires the Secretary of State, on or before January 1 of each odd-numbered year, to review
8 certain data on persons who are members of a minority group and are of limited-English

Assembly Amendment No. 382 to Assembly Bill No. 367 Page 4
9 proficiency in the State. Based on the review of such data, section 5 requires the Secretary of
10 State and certain county and city clerks, under certain circumstances, to ensure that voting
11 materials and other information are provided in certain other languages. Sections 13-15, 17-
12 19, 21, 22 and 28-31 of this bill make changes to require that certain information and voting
13 materials be made available in such languages. Section 42 of this bill requires the Secretary of
14 State to review such data in sufficient time for information and voting materials to be made
15 available for the 2026 General Election.
16 Sections 2-4] 4 of this bill [, respectively, define] defines the [terms “limited-English
17 proficiency,” “minority group” and] term “voting materials.” Section 11 of this bill applies
18 [these definitions] that definition to the provisions of existing law relating to elections.
19 Section 6 of this bill requires the Secretary of State [and authorizes a county clerk] to
20 establish a toll-free telephone number which may be used by any person to receive language
21 interpretation or assistance with translation relating to an election. [Sections 7, 17-19, 21, 25,
22 29 and 30 of this bill require that each polling place, sample ballot and Internet website of the
23 Secretary of State or county or city clerk, as applicable, include the toll-free telephone
24 number.
25 Section 8 of this bill requires the Secretary of State to include on all forms for an
26 application to preregister or register to vote certain language authorizing a person who
27 preregisters or registers to vote to request a sample ballot in a language other than English.
28 Under existing law, each county and city clerk is required to appoint registered voters to
29 act as election board officers for the various polling places in the county or city, as applicable.
30 (NRS 293.217, 293C.220) Sections 12 and 27 of this bill require the county or city clerk to
31 make a good faith effort to appoint election board officers who are bilingual.]
32 Section 9 of this bill requires the Secretary of State to employ a person to serve as
33 the language access coordinator for the Office of the Secretary of State, who is in the
34 classified service of the State.
35 Existing law provides that, with certain exceptions, any registered voter who by reason of
36 a physical disability or an inability to read or write English is unable to mark a ballot or use
37 any voting device without assistance is entitled to assistance from a consenting person of his
38 or her own choice. (NRS 293.296) Section 16 of this bill provides that a registered voter with
39 a physical disability may also use a mobile device to access interpretive services to assist him
40 or her in casting a vote in an election. Such interpretive services include, without limitation,
41 interpretive services using American Sign Language.
42 [Under existing law, the Secretary of State is required to prescribe forms for applications
43 to preregister or register to vote. (NRS 293.507) Section 20 of this bill requires the Secretary
44 of State to include on each such application a line on which an applicant may enter voluntarily
45 the applicant’s state or country of birth and language preference. Section 23 of this bill
46 requires such information to be included on the statewide voter registration list, if it is
47 provided by the applicant.
48 Under existing law, the Secretary of State is required to establish a user-friendly system
49 on the Internet website of the Office of the Secretary of State to allow persons by computer to
50 preregister and register to vote, cancel such preregistration or registration, update such
51 preregistration or registration and determine at what polling place or places he or she is
52 entitled to vote. (NRS 293.671) Section 22 requires the system to also be accessible in each
53 language in which the Secretary of State is required to provide information and voting
54 materials pursuant to section 5.
55 Section 24 of this bill provides that if the mechanical voting system used in a county or
56 city is capable of providing a registered voter’s ballot in the preferred language of the voter
57 other than English, the county or city clerk, as applicable, shall ensure that the list of offices
58 and candidates and the statement of ballot measures for which the voter is entitled to vote is in
59 that preferred language.
60 Section 37 of this bill creates the Language Access Advisory Committee within the
61 Office of the Secretary of State, consisting of the Secretary of State or his or her designee, and
62 certain other members. Sections 35 and 36 of this bill define “Advisory Committee” and
63 “language access programs” for the purposes of sections 34-39 of this bill. Section 38 requires
64 the Advisory Committee to: (1) identify certain programs and services that address language
65 accessibility of elections and voting materials; (2) coordinate with community organizations
66 to determine needs relating to language accessibility of elections and voting materials; (3) act
67 as a liaison between the Office of the Secretary of State and community organizations; (4)

Assembly Amendment No. 382 to Assembly Bill No. 367 Page 5
68 make certain annual assessments relating to language accessibility programs and services; and
69 (5) make certain recommendations to the Office of the Secretary of State relating to such
70 programs and services. Section 39 sets forth certain requirements for meetings of the Advisory
71 Committee. Section 41 of this bill: (1) requires the Secretary of State to appoint the initial
72 members of the Advisory Committee before January 1, 2026; and (2) staggers the terms of the
73 initial members.
74 Sections 5 and 40 of this bill require that the cost of ensuring that voting materials and
75 other elections information are posted or made available at a polling place in certain languages
76 be paid from the Reserve for Statutory Contingency Account.
77 Existing law authorizes, under certain circumstances, the governing body of a city to
78 conduct a city election in which all ballots must be cast by mail. If such an election is
79 conducted, certain existing provisions of law relating to early voting do not apply to the
80 election. (NRS 293C.112) Section 26 of this bill provides that the provisions of section 25
81 also do not apply to such a city election.
82 Section 32 of this bill makes a conforming change to make the provisions of section 7
83 apply to a presidential preference primary election.]
