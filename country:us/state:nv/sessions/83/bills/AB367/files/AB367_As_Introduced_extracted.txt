Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, each voting system used by a county or city is required to
2 provide voting materials in English and every language in which voting materials
3 are required to be prepared pursuant to federal law. (52 U.S.C. § 10503; NRS
4 293.2699) Section 5 of this bill requires the Secretary of State to ensure that voting
5 materials and other elections information are posted or made available at a polling
6 place or on certain Internet websites in certain languages. Section 5 further requires
7 the Secretary of State, on or before January 1 of each odd-numbered year, to review
8 certain data on persons who are members of a minority group and are of limited-
9 English proficiency in the State. Based on the review of such data, section 5
10 requires the Secretary of State and certain county and city clerks, under certain
11 circumstances, to ensure that voting materials and other information are provided in
12 certain other languages. Sections 13-15, 17-19, 21, 22 and 28-31 of this bill make
13 changes to require that certain information and voting materials be made available
14 in such languages. Section 42 of this bill requires the Secretary of State to review
15 such data in sufficient time for information and voting materials to be made
16 available for the 2026 General Election.
17 Sections 2-4 of this bill, respectively, define the terms “limited-English
18 proficiency,” “minority group” and “voting materials.” Section 11 of this bill
19 applies these definitions to the provisions of existing law relating to elections.
20 Section 6 of this bill requires the Secretary of State and authorizes a county
21 clerk to establish a toll-free telephone number which may be used by any person to
22 receive language interpretation or assistance with translation relating to an election.
23 Sections 7, 17-19, 21, 25, 29 and 30 of this bill require that each polling place,
24 sample ballot and Internet website of the Secretary of State or county or city clerk,
25 as applicable, include the toll-free telephone number.
26 Section 8 of this bill requires the Secretary of State to include on all forms for
27 an application to preregister or register to vote certain language authorizing a
28 person who preregisters or registers to vote to request a sample ballot in a language
29 other than English.
30 Under existing law, each county and city clerk is required to appoint registered
31 voters to act as election board officers for the various polling places in the county
32 or city, as applicable. (NRS 293.217, 293C.220) Sections 12 and 27 of this bill
33 require the county or city clerk to make a good faith effort to appoint election board
34 officers who are bilingual.
35 Existing law provides that, with certain exceptions, any registered voter who by
36 reason of a physical disability or an inability to read or write English is unable to
37 mark a ballot or use any voting device without assistance is entitled to assistance
38 from a consenting person of his or her own choice. (NRS 293.296) Section 16 of
39 this bill provides that a registered voter with a physical disability may also use a
40 mobile device to access interpretive services to assist him or her in casting a vote in
41 an election. Such interpretive services include, without limitation, interpretive
42 services using American Sign Language.
43 Under existing law, the Secretary of State is required to prescribe forms for
44 applications to preregister or register to vote. (NRS 293.507) Section 20 of this bill
45 requires the Secretary of State to include on each such application a line on which
46 an applicant may enter voluntarily the applicant’s state or country of birth and
47 language preference. Section 23 of this bill requires such information to be
48 included on the statewide voter registration list, if it is provided by the applicant.
49 Under existing law, the Secretary of State is required to establish a user-
50 friendly system on the Internet website of the Office of the Secretary of State to
51 allow persons by computer to preregister and register to vote, cancel such
52 preregistration or registration, update such preregistration or registration and
53 determine at what polling place or places he or she is entitled to vote. (NRS
54 293.671) Section 22 requires the system to also be accessible in each language in
-

55 which the Secretary of State is required to provide information and voting materials
56 pursuant to section 5.
57 Section 24 of this bill provides that if the mechanical voting system used in a
58 county or city is capable of providing a registered voter’s ballot in the preferred
59 language of the voter other than English, the county or city clerk, as applicable,
60 shall ensure that the list of offices and candidates and the statement of ballot
61 measures for which the voter is entitled to vote is in that preferred language.
62 Section 37 of this bill creates the Language Access Advisory Committee within
63 the Office of the Secretary of State, consisting of the Secretary of State or his or her
64 designee, and certain other members. Sections 35 and 36 of this bill define
65 “Advisory Committee” and “language access programs” for the purposes of
66 sections 34-39 of this bill. Section 38 requires the Advisory Committee to: (1)
67 identify certain programs and services that address language accessibility of
68 elections and voting materials; (2) coordinate with community organizations to
69 determine needs relating to language accessibility of elections and voting materials;
70 (3) act as a liaison between the Office of the Secretary of State and community
71 organizations; (4) make certain annual assessments relating to language
72 accessibility programs and services; and (5) make certain recommendations to the
73 Office of the Secretary of State relating to such programs and services. Section 39
74 sets forth certain requirements for meetings of the Advisory Committee. Section 41
75 of this bill: (1) requires the Secretary of State to appoint the initial members of the
76 Advisory Committee before January 1, 2026; and (2) staggers the terms of the
77 initial members.
78 Sections 5 and 40 of this bill require that the cost of ensuring that voting
79 materials and other elections information are posted or made available at a polling
80 place in certain languages be paid from the Reserve for Statutory Contingency
81 Account.
82 Existing law authorizes, under certain circumstances, the governing body of a
83 city to conduct a city election in which all ballots must be cast by mail. If such an
84 election is conducted, certain existing provisions of law relating to early voting do
85 not apply to the election. (NRS 293C.112) Section 26 of this bill provides that the
86 provisions of section 25 also do not apply to such a city election.
87 Section 32 of this bill makes a conforming change to make the provisions of
88 section 7 apply to a presidential preference primary election.

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, each voting system used by a county or city is required to
2 provide voting materials in English and every language in which voting materials
3 are required to be prepared pursuant to federal law. (52 U.S.C. § 10503; NRS
4 293.2699) Section 5 of this bill requires the Secretary of State to ensure that voting
5 materials and other elections information are posted or made available at a polling
6 place or on certain Internet websites in certain languages. Section 5 further requires
7 the Secretary of State, on or before January 1 of each odd-numbered year, to review
8 certain data on persons who are members of a minority group and are of limited-
9 English proficiency in the State. Based on the review of such data, section 5
10 requires the Secretary of State and certain county and city clerks, under certain
11 circumstances, to ensure that voting materials and other information are provided in
12 certain other languages. Sections 13-15, 17-19, 21, 22 and 28-31 of this bill make
13 changes to require that certain information and voting materials be made available
14 in such languages. Section 42 of this bill requires the Secretary of State to review
15 such data in sufficient time for information and voting materials to be made
16 available for the 2026 General Election.
17 Sections 2-4 of this bill, respectively, define the terms “limited-English
18 proficiency,” “minority group” and “voting materials.” Section 11 of this bill
19 applies these definitions to the provisions of existing law relating to elections.
20 Section 6 of this bill requires the Secretary of State and authorizes a county
21 clerk to establish a toll-free telephone number which may be used by any person to
22 receive language interpretation or assistance with translation relating to an election.
23 Sections 7, 17-19, 21, 25, 29 and 30 of this bill require that each polling place,
24 sample ballot and Internet website of the Secretary of State or county or city clerk,
25 as applicable, include the toll-free telephone number.
26 Section 8 of this bill requires the Secretary of State to include on all forms for
27 an application to preregister or register to vote certain language authorizing a
28 person who preregisters or registers to vote to request a sample ballot in a language
29 other than English.
30 Under existing law, each county and city clerk is required to appoint registered
31 voters to act as election board officers for the various polling places in the county
32 or city, as applicable. (NRS 293.217, 293C.220) Sections 12 and 27 of this bill
33 require the county or city clerk to make a good faith effort to appoint election board
34 officers who are bilingual.
35 Existing law provides that, with certain exceptions, any registered voter who by
36 reason of a physical disability or an inability to read or write English is unable to
37 mark a ballot or use any voting device without assistance is entitled to assistance
38 from a consenting person of his or her own choice. (NRS 293.296) Section 16 of
39 this bill provides that a registered voter with a physical disability may also use a
40 mobile device to access interpretive services to assist him or her in casting a vote in
41 an election. Such interpretive services include, without limitation, interpretive
42 services using American Sign Language.
43 Under existing law, the Secretary of State is required to prescribe forms for
44 applications to preregister or register to vote. (NRS 293.507) Section 20 of this bill
45 requires the Secretary of State to include on each such application a line on which
46 an applicant may enter voluntarily the applicant’s state or country of birth and
47 language preference. Section 23 of this bill requires such information to be
48 included on the statewide voter registration list, if it is provided by the applicant.
49 Under existing law, the Secretary of State is required to establish a user-
50 friendly system on the Internet website of the Office of the Secretary of State to
51 allow persons by computer to preregister and register to vote, cancel such
52 preregistration or registration, update such preregistration or registration and
53 determine at what polling place or places he or she is entitled to vote. (NRS
54 293.671) Section 22 requires the system to also be accessible in each language in
-

55 which the Secretary of State is required to provide information and voting materials
56 pursuant to section 5.
57 Section 24 of this bill provides that if the mechanical voting system used in a
58 county or city is capable of providing a registered voter’s ballot in the preferred
59 language of the voter other than English, the county or city clerk, as applicable,
60 shall ensure that the list of offices and candidates and the statement of ballot
61 measures for which the voter is entitled to vote is in that preferred language.
62 Section 37 of this bill creates the Language Access Advisory Committee within
63 the Office of the Secretary of State, consisting of the Secretary of State or his or her
64 designee, and certain other members. Sections 35 and 36 of this bill define
65 “Advisory Committee” and “language access programs” for the purposes of
66 sections 34-39 of this bill. Section 38 requires the Advisory Committee to: (1)
67 identify certain programs and services that address language accessibility of
68 elections and voting materials; (2) coordinate with community organizations to
69 determine needs relating to language accessibility of elections and voting materials;
70 (3) act as a liaison between the Office of the Secretary of State and community
71 organizations; (4) make certain annual assessments relating to language
72 accessibility programs and services; and (5) make certain recommendations to the
73 Office of the Secretary of State relating to such programs and services. Section 39
74 sets forth certain requirements for meetings of the Advisory Committee. Section 41
75 of this bill: (1) requires the Secretary of State to appoint the initial members of the
76 Advisory Committee before January 1, 2026; and (2) staggers the terms of the
77 initial members.
78 Sections 5 and 40 of this bill require that the cost of ensuring that voting
79 materials and other elections information are posted or made available at a polling
80 place in certain languages be paid from the Reserve for Statutory Contingency
81 Account.
82 Existing law authorizes, under certain circumstances, the governing body of a
83 city to conduct a city election in which all ballots must be cast by mail. If such an
84 election is conducted, certain existing provisions of law relating to early voting do
85 not apply to the election. (NRS 293C.112) Section 26 of this bill provides that the
86 provisions of section 25 also do not apply to such a city election.
87 Section 32 of this bill makes a conforming change to make the provisions of
88 section 7 apply to a presidential preference primary election.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

22 approved electronic transmission in any language in which voting
23 materials are required to be prepared pursuant to 52 U.S.C. §
