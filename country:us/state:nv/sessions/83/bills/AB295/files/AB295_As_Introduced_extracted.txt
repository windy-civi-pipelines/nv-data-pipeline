AN ACT relating to insurance; imposing requirements relating to
prior authorization; prescribing certain requirements

insurers; requiring the compilation and publication of
certain reports relating to prior authorization; providing

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes certain health insurers to require prior authorization
2 before an insured may receive coverage for health and dental care in certain
3 circumstances. If an insurer requires prior authorization, existing law requires the
4 insurer to respond to a request for prior authorization within 20 days of the
5 receiving the request. (NRS 687B.225) Sections 9 and 17 of this bill require an
6 insurer, including Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program, to
7 approve or make an adverse determination on a request for prior authorization, or
8 request additional, medically relevant information within: (1) five days after
9 receiving the request, for medical or dental care that is not urgent; or (2) forty-eight
10 hours after receiving the request, for care that is urgent. Sections 9 and 17 require
11 an insurer to transmit certain information to an insured and his or her provider of
12 health care after making an adverse determination on a request for prior
13 authorization pertaining to the insured. Sections 9 and 17 also provide that a
14 request for prior authorization that has been approved by the insurer for a
-

– 2 –
15 continuous course of treatment relating to a chronic or long-term condition remains
16 valid for 12 months, with certain exceptions.
17 Sections 6 and 18 of this bill require an insurer that employs or utilizes an
18 artificial intelligence system or automated decision tool and, if such a system or
19 tool is used under Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, the
20 Department of Health and Human Services to process requests for prior
21 authorization to transmit a notice to each of its insureds that: (1) discloses the
22 insurer’s use of the system or tool to process requests for prior authorization; and
23 (2) describes certain aspects of the system or tool. Section 6 and 18 prohibit an
24 insurer from using an artificial intelligence system or automated decision tool to
25 make an adverse determination on a request for prior authorization, or to terminate,
26 reduce or modify a previously approved request for prior authorization, unless that
27 action is independently reviewed by a physician or dentist, as applicable, who
28 possesses certain qualifications.
29 Section 7 of this bill requires certain insurers to annually compile and submit a
30 report to the Commissioner of Insurance and the Director of the Department of
31 Health and Human Services that contains certain information relating to the
32 requests for prior authorization for care provided to insureds in this State during the
33 immediately preceding year. Section 7 requires the Director and the Commissioner
34 to publish the reports submitted by insurers to on their respective Internet websites.
35 Section 19 of this bill requires the Department to annually compile and publish a
36 similar report containing information relating to requests for prior authorization for
37 care provided to recipients of Medicaid during the immediately preceding calendar
38 year.
39 Section 8 of this bill prescribes procedures for investigating and imposing
40 penalties against a private sector insurer that: (1) fails to submit a report required by
41 section 7; or (2) fails to comply with the requirements for making determinations
42 on requests for prior authorization during the periods of time established by section
43 9. Section 8 also prescribes the amount of the civil penalty that the Commissioner
44 must impose for such violations and authorizes the Commissioner to adopt
45 regulations prescribing additional sanctions for repeated noncompliance.
46 Sections 3-5 and 16 of this bill define certain terms, and section 2 of this bill
47 establishes the applicability of the definitions set forth in sections 3-5. Section 10
48 of this bill makes sections 2-8 applicable to nonprofit medical or dental service
49 corporations. Section 11 of this bill makes a conforming change to require the
50 Director of the Department of Health and Human Services to administer the
51 provisions of sections 15-19 in the same manner as other provisions governing
52 Medicaid. Sections 12, 13 and 21 of this bill require plans of self-insurance for
53 employees of local governments, the Public Employees’ Benefits Program and
54 plans of self-insurance for private employers, respectively, to comply with certain
55 requirements of sections 6 and 9, to the extent applicable. Section 15 of this bill
56 provides that managed care organizations that provide services to recipients of
57 Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program are exempt from sections 16-
58 19, which govern prior authorization under Medicaid and the Children’s Health
59 Insurance Program provided directly by the Department, but such managed care
60 organizations must comply with sections 3-9, which govern prior authorization
61 required by private sector health insurers. Section 20 of this bill requires any policy
62 or procedure established for prescription drug coverage under Medicaid relating to
63 prior authorization to comply with the provisions of sections 16-19.

ASSEMBLY BILL NO. 295–ASSEMBLYMEMBERS YUREK,
EDGEWORTH; AND BROWN-MAY
FEBRUARY 25, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Commerce and Labor
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to health insurance.
(BDR 57-238)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
CONTAINS UNFUNDED MANDATE (§ 12)
(NOT REQUESTED BY AFFECTED LOCAL GOVERNMENT)
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to insurance; imposing requirements relating to
prior authorization; prescribing certain requirements
relating to the use of artificial intelligence by health
insurers; requiring the compilation and publication of
certain reports relating to prior authorization; providing
for the investigation and adjudication of certain
violations; providing for the imposition of civil and
administrative penalties for such violations; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes certain health insurers to require prior authorization
2 before an insured may receive coverage for health and dental care in certain
3 circumstances. If an insurer requires prior authorization, existing law requires the
4 insurer to respond to a request for prior authorization within 20 days of the
5 receiving the request. (NRS 687B.225) Sections 9 and 17 of this bill require an
6 insurer, including Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program, to
7 approve or make an adverse determination on a request for prior authorization, or
8 request additional, medically relevant information within: (1) five days after
9 receiving the request, for medical or dental care that is not urgent; or (2) forty-eight
10 hours after receiving the request, for care that is urgent. Sections 9 and 17 require
11 an insurer to transmit certain information to an insured and his or her provider of
12 health care after making an adverse determination on a request for prior
13 authorization pertaining to the insured. Sections 9 and 17 also provide that a
14 request for prior authorization that has been approved by the insurer for a
-
*AB295*

– 2 –
15 continuous course of treatment relating to a chronic or long-term condition remains
16 valid for 12 months, with certain exceptions.
17 Sections 6 and 18 of this bill require an insurer that employs or utilizes an
18 artificial intelligence system or automated decision tool and, if such a system or
19 tool is used under Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, the
20 Department of Health and Human Services to process requests for prior
21 authorization to transmit a notice to each of its insureds that: (1) discloses the
22 insurer’s use of the system or tool to process requests for prior authorization; and
23 (2) describes certain aspects of the system or tool. Section 6 and 18 prohibit an
24 insurer from using an artificial intelligence system or automated decision tool to
25 make an adverse determination on a request for prior authorization, or to terminate,
26 reduce or modify a previously approved request for prior authorization, unless that
27 action is independently reviewed by a physician or dentist, as applicable, who
28 possesses certain qualifications.
29 Section 7 of this bill requires certain insurers to annually compile and submit a
30 report to the Commissioner of Insurance and the Director of the Department of
31 Health and Human Services that contains certain information relating to the
32 requests for prior authorization for care provided to insureds in this State during the
33 immediately preceding year. Section 7 requires the Director and the Commissioner
34 to publish the reports submitted by insurers to on their respective Internet websites.
35 Section 19 of this bill requires the Department to annually compile and publish a
36 similar report containing information relating to requests for prior authorization for
37 care provided to recipients of Medicaid during the immediately preceding calendar
38 year.
39 Section 8 of this bill prescribes procedures for investigating and imposing
40 penalties against a private sector insurer that: (1) fails to submit a report required by
41 section 7; or (2) fails to comply with the requirements for making determinations
42 on requests for prior authorization during the periods of time established by section
43 9. Section 8 also prescribes the amount of the civil penalty that the Commissioner
44 must impose for such violations and authorizes the Commissioner to adopt
45 regulations prescribing additional sanctions for repeated noncompliance.
46 Sections 3-5 and 16 of this bill define certain terms, and section 2 of this bill
47 establishes the applicability of the definitions set forth in sections 3-5. Section 10
48 of this bill makes sections 2-8 applicable to nonprofit medical or dental service
49 corporations. Section 11 of this bill makes a conforming change to require the
50 Director of the Department of Health and Human Services to administer the
51 provisions of sections 15-19 in the same manner as other provisions governing
52 Medicaid. Sections 12, 13 and 21 of this bill require plans of self-insurance for
53 employees of local governments, the Public Employees’ Benefits Program and
54 plans of self-insurance for private employers, respectively, to comply with certain
55 requirements of sections 6 and 9, to the extent applicable. Section 15 of this bill
56 provides that managed care organizations that provide services to recipients of
57 Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program are exempt from sections 16-
58 19, which govern prior authorization under Medicaid and the Children’s Health
59 Insurance Program provided directly by the Department, but such managed care
60 organizations must comply with sections 3-9, which govern prior authorization
61 required by private sector health insurers. Section 20 of this bill requires any policy
62 or procedure established for prescription drug coverage under Medicaid relating to
63 prior authorization to comply with the provisions of sections 16-19.
