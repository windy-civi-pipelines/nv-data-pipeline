EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to industrial insurance; revising the list of persons
who constitute a first responder for the purpose of
provisions governing the circumstances under which a
first responder may receive compensation under industrial
insurance for certain stress-related claims; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, with certain exceptions, an injury or disease sustained by
2 an employee that is caused by stress is compensable under industrial insurance if it
3 arose out of and in the course of his or her employment. Existing law deems an
4 injury or disease caused by stress that afflicts an employee who is a first responder
5 to arise out of and in the course of employment if the employee proves by clear and
6 convincing medical or psychiatric evidence that the employee has a mental injury
7 which is caused by extreme stress for which the primary cause was the employee
8 witnessing an event or series of events during the course of his or her employment
9 that involved: (1) the death, or the aftermath of the death, of a person as a result of
10 a violent event; or (2) an injury, or the aftermath of an injury, that involves grievous
11 bodily harm of a nature that shocks the conscience. Existing law defines the term
12 “first responder” for the purposes of those provisions to include: (1) a salaried or
13 volunteer firefighter; (2) a police officer; (3) an emergency dispatcher or call taker
14 who is employed by a law enforcement agency or public safety agency in this State;
15 or (4) an emergency medical technician or paramedic who is employed by a public
16 safety agency in this State. (NRS 616C.180)
17 This bill adds a civilian employee of a law enforcement agency who provides
18 support services to the law enforcement agency to the list of persons who constitute
19 a first responder for the purposes of provisions governing the circumstances under
20 which a first responder is authorized to receive compensation under industrial

21 insurance for certain stress-related claims. Additionally, this bill specifies that the
22 term “law enforcement agency,” for the purposes of those provisions, means any
23 agency, office, bureau, department, unit or division created by any statute,
24 ordinance or rule which has a duty to enforce the law and employs any person upon
25 whom some or all of the powers of a peace officer are conferred. Finally, this bill
26 also specifies that the term “public safety agency,” for the purposes of those
27 provisions, means: (1) a public fire department, fire protection district or other
28 agency of this State or a political subdivision of this State, the primary functions of
29 which are to control, extinguish and suppress fires; (2) a law enforcement agency;
30 or (3) an emergency medical service.
