Section 1:

CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to industrial insurance; revising the list of persons
who constitute a first responder for the purpose of provisions
governing the circumstances under which a first responder
may receive compensation under industrial insurance for
certain stress-related claims; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Under existing law, with certain exceptions, an injury or disease sustained by
an employee that is caused by stress is compensable under industrial insurance if it
arose out of and in the course of his or her employment. Existing law deems an
injury or disease caused by stress that afflicts an employee who is a first responder
to arise out of and in the course of employment if the employee proves by clear and
convincing medical or psychiatric evidence that the employee has a mental injury
which is caused by extreme stress for which the primary cause was the employee
witnessing an event or series of events during the course of his or her employment
that involved: (1) the death, or the aftermath of the death, of a person as a result of
a violent event; or (2) an injury, or the aftermath of an injury, that involves grievous
bodily harm of a nature that shocks the conscience. Existing law defines the term
“first responder” for the purposes of those provisions to include: (1) a salaried or
volunteer firefighter; (2) a police officer; (3) an emergency dispatcher or call taker
who is employed by a law enforcement agency or public safety agency in this State;
or (4) an emergency medical technician or paramedic who is employed by a public
safety agency in this State. (NRS 616C.180)
This bill adds a civilian employee of a law enforcement agency whose primary
duties involve responding to and investigating crime scenes to the list of persons
who constitute a first responder for the purposes of provisions governing the
circumstances under which a first responder is authorized to receive compensation
under industrial insurance for certain stress-related claims. Additionally, this bill
specifies that the term “law enforcement agency,” for the purposes of those
provisions, means any agency, office, bureau, department, unit or division created
by any statute, ordinance or rule which has a duty to enforce the law and employs
any person upon whom some or all of the powers of a peace officer are conferred.
Finally, this bill also specifies that the term “public safety agency,” for the purposes
of those provisions, means: (1) a public fire department, fire protection district or
other agency of this State or a political subdivision of this State, the primary
functions of which are to control, extinguish and suppress fires; (2) a law
enforcement agency; or (3) an emergency medical service.
