AN ACT relating to industrial insurance; revising the list of persons
who constitute a first responder for the purpose of
provisions governing the circumstances under which a
first responder may receive compensation under industrial
insurance for certain stress-related claims; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, with certain exceptions, an injury or disease sustained by
2 an employee that is caused by stress is compensable under industrial insurance if it
3 arose out of and in the course of his or her employment. Existing law deems an
4 injury or disease caused by stress that afflicts an employee who is a first responder
5 to arise out of and in the course of employment if the employee proves by clear and
6 convincing medical or psychiatric evidence that the employee has a mental injury
7 which is caused by extreme stress for which the primary cause was the employee
8 witnessing an event or series of events during the course of his or her employment
9 that involved: (1) the death, or the aftermath of the death, of a person as a result of
10 a violent event; or (2) an injury, or the aftermath of an injury, that involves grievous
11 bodily harm of a nature that shocks the conscience. Existing law defines the term
12 “first responder” for the purposes of those provisions to include: (1) a salaried or
13 volunteer firefighter; (2) a police officer; (3) an emergency dispatcher or call taker
14 who is employed by a law enforcement agency or public safety agency in this State;
15 or (4) an emergency medical technician or paramedic who is employed by a public
16 safety agency in this State. (NRS 616C.180)
17 This bill adds a civilian employee of a law enforcement agency whose primary
18 duties involve responding to and investigating crime scenes to the list of persons
19 who constitute a first responder for the purposes of provisions governing the
-

– 2 –
20 circumstances under which a first responder is authorized to receive compensation
21 under industrial insurance for certain stress-related claims. Additionally, this bill
22 specifies that the term “law enforcement agency,” for the purposes of those
23 provisions, means any agency, office, bureau, department, unit or division created
24 by any statute, ordinance or rule which has a duty to enforce the law and employs
25 any person upon whom some or all of the powers of a peace officer are conferred.
26 Finally, this bill also specifies that the term “public safety agency,” for the purposes
27 of those provisions, means: (1) a public fire department, fire protection district or
28 other agency of this State or a political subdivision of this State, the primary
29 functions of which are to control, extinguish and suppress fires; (2) a law
30 enforcement agency; or (3) an emergency medical service.
