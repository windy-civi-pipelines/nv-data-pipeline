4 or registrants relating to the cultivation, processing, manufacture, transport,

8 relating to the testing of cannabis and cannabis products. Section 3 requires the
9 regulations to set forth certain requirements, including the requirement that
10 representative samples of each lot of cannabis be tested by a cannabis independent
11 testing laboratory and various requirements concerning the collection of such
12 representative samples. Section 3 defines the term “lot” to mean: (1) the flowers
13 from one or more cannabis plants of the same harvest batch, in a quantity that
14 weighs 15 pounds or less; (2) the leaves or other plant matter from one or more
15 cannabis plants of the same harvest batch, other than full female flowers, in a
16 quantity that weighs 45 pounds or less; or (3) the wet flower, leaves or other plant
17 matter from one or more cannabis plants of the same harvest batch used only for
