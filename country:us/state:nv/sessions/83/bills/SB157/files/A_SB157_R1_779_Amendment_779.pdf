AN ACT relating to cannabis; requiring the Cannabis Compliance Board to adopt
regulations setting forth requirements for licensees or registrants
relating to the testing of cannabis and cannabis products; setting forth
various requirements for the contents of those regulations; [requiring
the Board to develop and implement a process by which a licensee may

providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the Cannabis Compliance Board to adopt regulations to carry out
2 the provisions of existing law governing the cannabis industry in this State. Under existing
3 law, such regulations may include requirements for licensees or registrants relating to the
4 cultivation, processing, manufacture, transport, distribution, testing, study, advertising and
5 sale of cannabis and cannabis products. (NRS 678A.450) Sections 1 and 3 of this bill require,
6 rather than authorize, the Board to adopt regulations setting forth requirements for licensees
7 and registrants relating to the testing of cannabis and cannabis products. Section 3 requires the
8 regulations to set forth certain requirements, including the requirement that representative
9 samples of each lot of cannabis be tested by a cannabis independent testing laboratory and
10 various requirements concerning the collection of such representative samples. Section 3
11 defines the term “lot” to mean: (1) the flowers from one or more cannabis plants of the same
12 harvest batch, in a quantity that weighs [7.5] 15 pounds or less; (2) the leaves or other plant
13 matter from one or more cannabis plants of the same harvest batch, other than full female
14 flowers, in a quantity that weighs [20] 45 pounds or less; or (3) the wet flower, leaves or other
15 plant matter from one or more cannabis plants of the same harvest batch used only for
16 extraction, in a quantity that weighs [135] 150 pounds or less within 2 hours of harvest.
17 [Section 5 of this bill increases the weight limit for a lot of cannabis flower to 10 pounds or
18 less, effective October 1, 2026. Section 3 sets forth procedures by which the Board may adjust
19 any of the weight limits for lots. Section 3 additionally requires the Board to develop and
20 implement a process by which a licensee may petition the Board for an exception from any
21 downward adjustment in the weight limit of a lot.
22 Section 4 of this bill requires the Board to develop, maintain and make available on the
23 Internet website of the Board an electronic portal that is publicly accessible and through

Assembly Amendment No. 779 to Senate Bill No. 157 First Reprint Page 4
24 which: (1) a person may file certain complaints with the Board; and (2) the Board is required
25 to provide certain notices.]

Assembly Amendment No. 779 to Senate Bill No. 157 First Reprint Page 6
1 (a) The evaluation reveals that:
2 (1) New scientific data has emerged that supports the adjustment of the
3 weight limit; or
4 (2) In the period since the last evaluation was conducted or, for the

18 5. The Board shall develop and implement a process by which a licensee

22 established by the Board. If the Board approves such a petition, the weight limit
23 for any lots of the petitioner for the purpose of any requirements relating to the
24 testing of cannabis shall be deemed to be the applicable weight limit in effect
25 immediately before the downward adjustment that the petition relates to becomes
26 effective, notwithstanding any provision of the regulations establishing the
