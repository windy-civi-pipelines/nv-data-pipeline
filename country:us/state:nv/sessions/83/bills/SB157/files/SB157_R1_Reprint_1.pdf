1 Existing law authorizes the Cannabis Compliance Board to adopt regulations to
2 carry out the provisions of existing law governing the cannabis industry in this
3 State. Under existing law, such regulations may include requirements for licensees
4 or registrants relating to the cultivation, processing, manufacture, transport,
5 distribution, testing, study, advertising and sale of cannabis and cannabis products.
6 (NRS 678A.450) Sections 1 and 3 of this bill require, rather than authorize, the
7 Board to adopt regulations setting forth requirements for licensees and registrants
8 relating to the testing of cannabis and cannabis products. Section 3 requires the
9 regulations to set forth certain requirements, including the requirement that
10 representative samples of each lot of cannabis be tested by a cannabis independent
11 testing laboratory and various requirements concerning the collection of such
12 representative samples. Section 3 defines the term “lot” to mean: (1) the flowers
13 from one or more cannabis plants of the same harvest batch, in a quantity that
14 weighs 7.5 pounds or less; (2) the leaves or other plant matter from one or more
15 cannabis plants of the same harvest batch, other than full female flowers, in a
16 quantity that weighs 20 pounds or less; or (3) the wet flower, leaves or other plant
17 matter from one or more cannabis plants of the same harvest batch used only for

18 extraction, in a quantity that weighs 135 pounds or less within 2 hours of harvest.
19 Section 5 of this bill increases the weight limit for a lot of cannabis flower to 10
20 pounds or less, effective October 1, 2026. Section 3 sets forth procedures by which
21 the Board may adjust any of the weight limits for lots. Section 3 additionally
22 requires the Board to develop and implement a process by which a licensee may
23 petition the Board for an exception from any downward adjustment in the weight
24 limit of a lot.
25 Section 4 of this bill requires the Board to develop, maintain and make
26 available on the Internet website of the Board an electronic portal that is publicly
27 accessible and through which: (1) a person may file certain complaints with the
28 Board; and (2) the Board is required to provide certain notices.
