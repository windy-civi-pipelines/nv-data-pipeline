Board to adopt regulations setting forth requirements for
licensees or registrants relating to the testing of cannabis and
cannabis products; setting forth various requirements for the
contents of those regulations; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law authorizes the Cannabis Compliance Board to adopt regulations to
carry out the provisions of existing law governing the cannabis industry in this
State. Under existing law, such regulations may include requirements for licensees
or registrants relating to the cultivation, processing, manufacture, transport,
distribution, testing, study, advertising and sale of cannabis and cannabis products.
(NRS 678A.450) Sections 1 and 3 of this bill require, rather than authorize, the
Board to adopt regulations setting forth requirements for licensees and registrants
relating to the testing of cannabis and cannabis products. Section 3 requires the
regulations to set forth certain requirements, including the requirement that
representative samples of each lot of cannabis be tested by a cannabis independent
testing laboratory and various requirements concerning the collection of such
representative samples. Section 3 defines the term “lot” to mean: (1) the flowers
from one or more cannabis plants of the same harvest batch, in a quantity that
weighs 15 pounds or less; (2) the leaves or other plant matter from one or more
cannabis plants of the same harvest batch, other than full female flowers, in a
quantity that weighs 45 pounds or less; or (3) the wet flower, leaves or other plant
matter from one or more cannabis plants of the same harvest batch used only for
extraction, in a quantity that weighs 150 pounds or less within 2 hours of harvest.
