AN ACT relating to insurance; revising provisions relating to prior
authorization for certain medical and dental care; revising
provisions relating to the coverage of autism spectrum
disorders for certain persons; prohibiting health insurers

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes certain health insurers to require prior authorization
2 before an insured may receive coverage for medical and dental care in certain
3 circumstances. If an insurer requires prior authorization, existing law requires the
4 insurer to: (1) file its procedure for obtaining prior authorization with the
5 Commissioner of Insurance for approval; and (2) respond to a request for prior
6 authorization within 20 days after receiving the request. (NRS 687B.225) This bill
7 establishes additional requirements relating to the use of prior authorization for
8 medical and dental care by health insurers, including Medicaid, the Children’s
9 Health Insurance Program and insurance for public employees.
10 Specifically, sections 25 and 56 of this bill require that a procedure for
11 obtaining prior authorization includes: (1) a list of the specific goods and services
12 for which the insurer requires prior authorization; and (2) the clinical review
13 criteria used by the insurer to evaluate requests for prior authorization. Sections 25
14 and 56 also require an insurer to publish its procedure for obtaining prior
15 authorization on its Internet website and update that website as necessary to
16 account for any changes in the procedure. Sections 25 and 56 prohibit an insurer
17 from denying a claim for payment for medical or dental care because of the failure
18 to obtain prior authorization if the insurer’s procedures for obtaining prior
-

– 2 –
19 authorization in effect on the date on which the care was provided did not require
20 prior authorization for that care.
21 Sections 25 and 57 of this bill require a determination concerning a request for
22 prior authorization to include a determination of whether the purported insured is
23 currently insured by the insurer and eligible for coverage. Sections 25 and 57 also
24 revise the period for insurers to take action on a request for prior authorization by
25 requiring an insurer to approve or make an adverse determination on such a request,
26 or request additional, medically relevant information within: (1) 48 hours after
27 receiving the request, for medical or dental care that is not urgent; or (2) 24 hours
28 after receiving the request, for care that is urgent. Sections 13 and 58 of this bill
29 require any adverse determination on a request for prior authorization to be made
30 by a licensed physician or, for a request relating to dental care, a dentist, who has
31 certain qualifications. Sections 13 and 58 require an insurer, in certain
32 circumstances, to allow the provider of health care who requested the prior
33 authorization to discuss the issues involved in the request with the physician or
34 dentist who is responsible for making a determination on the request. Sections 13
35 and 58 require an insurer, upon making an adverse determination on a request for
36 prior authorization, to transmit certain information to the insured to whom the
37 request pertains, including information relating to the right of the insured to appeal
38 the adverse determination. Sections 13 and 58 further require: (1) an insurer to
39 establish a process for appeals that provides for the timely resolution of appeals
40 submitted by insureds; and (2) a decision upholding an adverse determination on an
41 appeal submitted by an insured to be made by a physician or dentist who has
42 qualifications beyond those required of a physician or dentist who evaluates initial
43 requests for prior authorization.
44 Sections 14 and 59 of this bill: (1) require an insurer to continue to honor the
45 approval of a request for prior authorization despite certain changes to coverage or
46 the criteria for approving such requests; (2) prohibit an insurer from requiring an
47 insured with a chronic or long-term condition who has received prior authorization
48 for care for the condition to seek additional prior authorization for that same care in
49 certain circumstances; and (3) require an insurer, for the first 90 days after the
50 coverage period begins for a new insured, to honor a request for prior authorization
51 that has been approved by the previous insurer of the new insured, under certain
52 circumstances. Sections 15 and 60 of this bill establish certain limited
53 circumstances under which an insurer may revoke, limit, condition or restrict an
54 approval of a request for prior authorization previously granted by the insurer.
55 Sections 16 and 61 of this bill prohibit an insurer from refusing to pay a claim or
56 reducing the amount paid to a provider of health care for a claim for medical or
57 dental care that was previously approved by the insurer, with certain exceptions.
58 Sections 17 and 63 of this bill prohibit an insurer from requiring prior
59 authorization for covered emergency services. Sections 17 and 63 prohibit an
60 insurer from requiring that an insured or provider of health care notify the insurer
61 earlier than the end of the business day following the date of admission or the date
62 on which the emergency services are provided. Sections 17 and 63: (1) prohibit an
63 insurer from denying coverage for covered medically necessary emergency
64 services; and (2) establish a presumption of medical necessity under certain
65 conditions. Sections 17 and 63 also require an insurer to respond to a request for
66 prior authorization for certain follow-up care relating to the emergency care
67 received by an insured within 60 minutes after receiving the request.
68 Sections 18 and 62 of this bill prohibit an insurer from requiring prior
69 authorization for: (1) certain invasive procedures that are incidental to or different
70 from a procedure for which the insurer has already granted prior authorization or
71 does not require prior authorization; and (2) prescription drugs for pain relief
72 prescribed to an insured that has been diagnosed with a terminal condition.
73 Sections 18 and 62 require an insured to treat appeals and requests for prior
-
*SB398*

– 3 –
74 authorization for care relating to mental, emotional, behavioral or substance use
75 disorders or conditions equally to appeals and requests for prior authorization for
76 other types of care.
77 Sections 22 and 69 of this bill require insurers to receive and respond to
78 requests for prior authorization for prescription drugs through a secure transmission
79 that complies with a standard established by the National Council for Prescription
80 Drug Programs for the electronic transmission of pharmaceutical records. Section
81 69 additionally prohibits Medicaid from requiring prior authorization for certain
82 prescription drugs for medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder in
83 conformance with similar requirements in existing law governing private insurers.
84 (NRS 689A.0459, 689B.0319, 689C.1665, 695A.1874, 695B.19197, 695C.1699,
85 695G.1719)
86 Sections 19 and 64 of this bill require insurers to exempt a provider of health
87 care from the requirement to obtain prior authorization for specific goods or
88 services if the insurer has granted requests for prior authorization for those goods or
89 services submitted by the provider at a rate of 80 percent or more during the
90 previous year. Sections 19 and 64 require insurers to annually conduct reviews of
91 each provider of health care in the network of the insurer or who participates in
92 Medicaid, as applicable, to determine whether each such provider qualifies for an
93 exemption. If a provider of health care qualifies for an exemption, sections 19 and
94 64 require an insurer to automatically grant the exemption for the applicable goods
95 or services without requiring the provider of health care to affirmatively request an
96 exemption. Sections 20 and 65 of this bill prescribe the requirements and
97 procedure for an insurer to revoke an exemption granted to a provider of health
98 care. Sections 20 and 65 also require an insurer to establish a procedure by which a
99 provider of health care may appeal such a revocation.
100 Sections 3-12 and 50-55 of this bill define certain terms relating to the process
101 of obtaining and processing requests for prior authorization, and sections 2 and 49
102 of this bill establish the applicability of those definitions. Sections 21 and 66 of
103 this bill provide that if an insurer violates any provision of section 13-18, 25 or 56-
104 63 with respect to a particular request for prior authorization, that the request is
105 deemed approved. Sections 21 and 66 also provide that a provision of any contract
106 or agreement that conflicts with the provisions of section 13-21, 25 or 56-66 is
107 void and unenforceable.
108 Sections 23 and 67 of this bill require an insurer to annually publish on its
109 Internet website certain information relating to requests for prior authorization that
110 have been processed by the insurer during the immediately preceding year.
111 Sections 24 and 68 of this bill additionally require an insurer to compile and
112 publish an annual report of certain information relating to requests for prior
113 authorization processed by the insurer during the immediately preceding year.
114 Section 36 of this bill requires a nonprofit hospital and medical or dental
115 service corporation to comply with sections 2-25. Section 44 of this bill requires
116 the Director of the Department of Health and Human Services to administer the
117 provisions of sections 48-68 of this bill in the same manner as other provisions
118 governing Medicaid. Sections 45, 46 and 70 of this bill require plans of self-
119 insurance for employees of local governments, the Public Employees’ Benefits
120 Program and plans of self-insurance for private employers, respectively, to comply
121 with the requirements of sections 2-25 to the extent applicable. Section 48 provides
122 that a managed care organization that provides services to recipients of Medicaid or
123 the Children’s Health Insurance Program is not subject to sections 49-68, but must
124 comply with sections 2-25. Section 69 requires the policies and procedures for
125 coverage for prescription drugs under Medicaid to comply with sections 49-68.
126 Existing law prohibits certain insurers from considering the availability of, or
127 eligibility of an insured for medical assistance under Medicaid when making
128 payments for claims under a policy of health insurance, or determining the
-
*SB398*

– 4 –
129 insured’s eligibility for coverage under the policy. (NRS 689A.430, 689B.300,
130 695A.151, 695B.340, 695C.163, 695F.440) Sections 30, 32 and 41 of this bill also
131 impose this prohibition on health carriers for small employers and managed care
132 organizations. Sections 27, 29, 30, 32, 34, 37, 38, 40 and 41 of this bill additionally
133 prohibit all private health insurers regulated under state law from considering the
134 availability of, or eligibility of an insured for any other governmental program,
135 including Medicare and benefits under Social Security, for these purposes.
136 Existing law requires certain private health insurance plans to provide coverage
137 for screening for, diagnosing and treating autism spectrum disorders to insureds
138 who are less than 18 years of age, or until the insured reaches 22 years of age, if the
139 insured is enrolled in high school. Existing law subjects this coverage to a
140 maximum benefit of $72,000 per year for applied behavior analysis treatment.
141 Existing law also requires the course of treatment for autism spectrum disorders to
142 be identified in a treatment plan. (NRS 689A.0435, 689B.0335, 689C.1655,
143 695C.1717, 695G.1645) Sections 33 and 35 of this bill additionally impose this
144 requirement on fraternal benefit societies and nonprofit hospital or medical services
145 corporations. Sections 26, 28, 31, 33, 35, 39 and 43 of this bill require private
146 health insurance plans to provide coverage for screening for, diagnosing and
147 treating autism spectrum disorders to an insured until he or she reaches 27 years of
148 age. Sections 26, 28, 31, 33, 35, 39 and 43 also: (1) remove the maximum benefit
149 for coverage of applied behavior analysis treatment; (2) eliminate the requirement
150 that the course of treatment be identified in a treatment plan; and (3) eliminate
151 certain other authorized restrictions and limitations on coverage of screening for,
152 diagnosing and treating autism spectrum disorders.

4 has been approved by a health carrier obtains coverage under a
5 different policy or contract of health insurance issued by the same

19 4. Within the first 90 days after the coverage period for an
20 insured begins, a health carrier shall honor a request for prior

32 the care approved by the previous health carrier of an insured

35 may not deny approval in violation of subsection 4 as the result of
36 such a review.
37 Sec. 15. 1. A health carrier may revoke, limit, condition or
38 restrict an approval granted for a request for prior authorization
39 only if:
40 (a) The care to which the request pertains was not provided
41 within 45 business days after the health carrier received the
42 request;
43 (b) The health carrier determines that any of the conditions
44 under which the health carrier may refuse to pay a claim pursuant

3 or contract of insurance issued by the health carrier on the date
4 on which the approved care was provided; and
5 (2) Has satisfied the conditions of subsection 2.
6 2. A health carrier may revoke, limit, condition or restrict an
7 approval granted for a request for prior authorization pursuant to
8 paragraph (c) of subsection 1 only if, before the care to which the

10 provider of health care who provided the care a mechanism by
11 which the provider of health care could confirm whether the
12 insured is:
13 (a) Covered by the health carrier; and
14 (b) Eligible to receive coverage for the care on the date on
15 which the care is scheduled to be provided, including, without
16 limitation, the length of any approved inpatient stay in a medical
17 facility.
18 3. As used in this section, “medical facility” has the meaning
19 ascribed to it in NRS 449.0151.
20 Sec. 16. A health carrier that has approved a request for
21 prior authorization shall not refuse to pay a claim for the medical
22 or dental care approved by the health carrier or refuse to pay a
23 provider of health care who participates in the network of the
24 health carrier at the applicable contracted rate for the approved
25 care unless:
26 1. The approval is later revoked, limited, conditioned or
27 restricted pursuant to section 15 of this act in a manner that
28 precludes payment of the claim.
29 2. The medical or dental care at issue was never performed.
30 3. The claim for the medical or dental care was not timely
31 submitted in accordance with the applicable terms and conditions
32 of the policy or contract of insurance issued by the health carrier.
33 4. The medical or dental care at issue was not a covered
34 benefit on the date on which the care was provided.
35 5. The health carrier possesses specific evidence available for
36 review by the Commissioner or by law enforcement that the
37 insured to whom the approval pertains or the provider of health
38 care of the insured made a material or fraudulent representation
39 to obtain the approval or fraudulently obtained the approval by
40 other means.
41 6. The insured exhausted the applicable coverage or benefit
42 under the terms and conditions of the policy or contract of
43 insurance after the health carrier approved the care but before the
44 claim for the care was processed by the health carrier. A health
45 carrier may refuse to provide coverage or pay a claim on these
-
*SB398*

– 10 –
1 grounds only if the health carrier disclosed to the insured at the
2 time that the health carrier approved the request for the care that
3 the care authorized might exceed the coverage or benefits provided
4 under the policy or contract, and would accordingly not be
5 covered.
6 7. The provider of health care was not participating in the
7 network of the health carrier on the date on which the care was
8 provided.
9 Sec. 17. 1. A health carrier shall not require prior
10 authorization for emergency services covered by the health
11 carrier, including, where applicable, transportation by ambulance
12 to a hospital or other medical facility.
13 2. If a health carrier requires an insured or his or her
14 provider of health care to notify the health carrier that the insured
15 has been admitted to a hospital to receive emergency services or
16 has received emergency services, the health carrier shall not
17 require an insured or a provider of health care to transmit such a
18 notice earlier than the end of the business day immediately
19 following the day on which the insured was admitted or the
20 emergency services were provided, as applicable.
21 3. A health carrier shall not deny coverage for emergency
22 services covered by the health carrier that are medically necessary.
23 Emergency services are presumed to be medically necessary if,
24 within 72 hours after an insured is admitted to receive emergency
25 services, the provider of health care of the insured transmits to the
26 health carrier a certification, in writing, that the condition of the
27 insured required emergency services. The health carrier may rebut
28 that presumption by establishing, by clear and convincing
29 evidence, that the emergency services were not medically
30 necessary.
31 4. If an insured receives emergency services and must
32 additionally receive post-evaluation or post-stabilization medical
33 care, and a health carrier requires prior authorization for the
34 post-evaluation or post-stabilization medical care, the health
35 carrier shall approve or make an adverse determination on a
36 request for prior authorization for such care within 60 minutes
37 after receiving the request.
38 5. A health carrier shall make all determinations for whether
39 emergency services are medically necessary without regard to
40 whether a provider of health care that provided or billed for those
41 services participates in the network of the health carrier.
42 6. A health carrier shall not impose a restriction or limitation
43 on coverage of emergency services provided by a provider of

10 authorization for a covered prescription drug that is prescribed for
11 the purpose of treating or managing pain if the insured to whom
12 the request pertains is diagnosed with a terminal condition and the
13 diagnosis of the condition is indicated on the request for prior
14 authorization.
15 3. A health carrier shall act on a request for prior
16 authorization relating to a course of treatment for a mental,

21 carrier shall additionally treat an appeal of an adverse
22 determination on a request for prior authorization relating to a

40 (a) Automatically grant the exemption without requiring the
41 provider of health care to submit a request for the exemption; and
42 (b) Transmit to the provider of health care after granting the
43 exemption a notice that includes:
44 (1) A statement that the provider of health care has been
45 granted an exemption from the requirement to obtain prior

10 care who participate in the network of the health carrier to
11 determine whether those providers meet the criteria prescribed by
12 subsection 1 for an exemption from the requirement to obtain
13 prior authorization. If a provider of health care is initially
14 determined to be ineligible for an exemption based on such a
15 review, the eligibility of the provider of health care to receive an
16 exemption must be independently determined by a provider of
17 health care who:
18 (a) Is licensed in this State;
19 (b) Is of the same or similar specialty as the provider of health

24 from the requirement to obtain prior authorization for a particular
25 good or service may, for that specific good or service, request from
26 the health carrier any evidence that supported the decision of the
27 health carrier to not grant the exemption for that good or service.
28 A provider of health care may submit a request for supporting
29 evidence pursuant to this subsection not more than once during a
30 single 12-month period for each good or service for which the
31 provider of health care has not been granted an exemption.
32 4. An exemption from the requirement to obtain prior
33 authorization pursuant to this section applies to the provision of
34 any good or service covered by the exemption which is provided or
35 ordered by the provider of health care to whom the exception
36 applies.
37 5. A health carrier shall not deny a claim or reduce the
38 amount of payment paid under a claim for a good or service that is
39 subject to an exemption pursuant to this section unless:
40 (a) The provider of health care who submitted the claim
41 knowingly and materially misrepresented the goods or services
42 actually provided to an insured, and the provider of health care
43 made the misrepresentation with the specific intent to obtain a
44 payment from the health carrier to which the provider of health
45 care is not legally or contractually entitled; or
-
*SB398*

– 13 –
1 (b) The service or good for which payment is sought was not
2 substantially performed or provided, as applicable.
3 Sec. 20. 1. Not more than once during a single 12-month
4 period, a health carrier may reevaluate the eligibility of a provider
5 of health care to receive an exemption from the requirement to
6 obtain prior authorization pursuant to section 19 of this act.
7 2. A health carrier may revoke an exemption from the

12 good or service to which the exemption applies based on:
13 (a) A retrospective review of claims submitted by the provider
14 of health care for that good or service during the immediately
15 preceding 3 months; or
16 (b) If the provider of health care did not submit at least 10
17 claims for that good or service during the immediately preceding 3
18 months, a retrospective review of at least the last 10 claims
19 submitted by the provider of health care for that good or service.
20 3. If it is initially determined that a provider of health care
21 meets the criteria prescribed in subsection 2 for the revocation of
22 an exemption based on a review conducted pursuant to that
23 subsection, the satisfaction of those criteria must be independently
24 determined by a provider of health care described in subsection 2
25 of section 19 of this act before the health carrier may revoke the
26 exemption.
27 4. A health carrier that revokes an exemption from the
28 requirement to obtain prior authorization pursuant to subsection 2

30 revocation pertains a notice that includes:

45 exemption must remain in effect:
-
*SB398*

– 14 –
1 (a) If the revocation is reversed on appeal, until the next
2 reevaluation pursuant to subsection 1 of the eligibility of the
3 provider of health care to continue receiving the exemption.

5 5th calendar day after the revocation is upheld or the date
6 contained within the notice sent to the provider of health care
7 pursuant to subsection 4.
8 Sec. 21. 1. If a health carrier violates NRS 687B.225 or
9 sections 13 to 18, inclusive, of this act with respect to a particular
10 request for prior authorization, the request shall be deemed

18 (2) Subject the recipient to severe pain that cannot be
19 adequately managed without receiving such care.

2 determination on the request.
3 3. Upon rendering an adverse determination on a request for
4 prior authorization, the Department shall immediately transmit to
5 the recipient to whom the request pertains a written notice that
6 contains:
7 (a) A specific description of all reasons that the Department
8 made the adverse determination;
9 (b) A description of any documentation that the Department
10 requested from the recipient or a provider of health care of the
11 recipient and did not receive or deemed insufficient, if the failure

25 each appeal within a reasonable time.
26 5. The Department shall not uphold on appeal an adverse

-
*SB398*

– 59 –
1 to pay a provider of health care at the applicable rate for the
2 approved care unless:

34 3. The Department shall act on a request for prior
35 authorization relating to a course of treatment for a mental,
36 emotional, behavioral or substance use disorder or condition in a
37 manner that is consistent with the manner that the Department
38 would act on a request for prior authorization relating to a course
39 of treatment for any other type of disease or condition. The
40 Department shall additionally treat an appeal of an adverse
41 determination on a request for prior authorization relating to a

7 Sec. 63. 1. The Department, with respect to Medicaid and
8 the Children’s Health Insurance Program, shall not require prior

13 provider of health care to notify the Department that the recipient
14 has been admitted to a hospital to receive emergency services or
15 has received emergency services, the Department shall not require
16 a recipient or a provider of health care to transmit such a notice
17 earlier than the end of the business day immediately following the
18 day on which the recipient was admitted or the emergency services
19 were provided, as applicable.
20 3. The Department shall not deny coverage for emergency
21 services covered by Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance
22 Program that are medically necessary. Emergency services are
23 presumed to be medically necessary if, within 72 hours after a
24 recipient is admitted to receive emergency services, the recipient’s
25 provider of health care transmits to the Department a certification,
26 in writing, that the condition of the recipient required emergency
27 services. The Department may rebut that presumption by
28 establishing, by clear and convincing evidence, that the emergency
29 services were not medically necessary.
30 4. If a recipient receives emergency services and must
31 additionally receive post-evaluation or post-stabilization medical
32 care, and the Department requires prior authorization for the post-
33 evaluation or post-stabilization medical care, the Department shall

43 care qualifies for an exemption pursuant to this section, the
44 Department shall:
-
*SB398*

– 61 –
1 (a) Automatically grant the exemption without requiring the
2 provider of health care to submit a request for the exemption; and
3 (b) Transmit to the provider of health care after granting the
4 exemption a notice that includes:
5 (1) A statement that the provider of health care has been
6 granted an exemption from the requirement to obtain prior
7 authorization from the Department for the specific goods and
8 services listed pursuant to subparagraph (2);
9 (2) A list of goods and services to which the exemption

13 Department granted the exemption.
14 2. The Department shall provide for an annual review of all
15 of the requests for prior authorization submitted by providers of
16 health care during the immediately preceding year to determine
17 whether those providers meet the criteria prescribed by subsection
18 1 for an exemption from the requirement to obtain prior
19 authorization. If a provider of health care is initially determined to
20 be ineligible for an exemption based on such a review, the
21 eligibility of the provider of health care to receive an exemption
22 must be independently determined by a provider of health care
23 who:
24 (a) Is licensed in this State;
25 (b) Is of the same or similar specialty as the provider of health
26 care who is being evaluated for an exemption; and
27 (c) Has experience providing the good or service for which the

30 from the requirement to obtain prior authorization for a particular
31 good or service may, for that specific good or service, request from
32 the Department any evidence that supported the decision of the
33 Department to not grant the exemption for that good or service. A
34 provider of health care may submit a request for supporting
35 evidence pursuant to this subsection not more than once during a
36 single 12-month period for each good or service for which the
37 provider of health care has not been granted an exemption.
38 4. An exemption from the requirement to obtain prior
39 authorization pursuant to this section applies to the provision of
40 any good or service covered by the exemption which is provided or
41 ordered by the provider of health care to whom the exception
42 applies.
43 5. The Department shall not deny a claim or reduce the
44 amount of payment paid under a claim for a good or service that is
45 subject to an exemption pursuant to this section unless:
-
*SB398*

– 62 –
1 (a) The provider of health care who submitted the claim
2 knowingly and materially misrepresented the goods or services
3 actually provided to a recipient, and the provider of health care
4 made the misrepresentation with the specific intent to obtain a
5 payment from the Department to which the provider of health care
6 is not legally or contractually entitled; or
7 (b) The service or good for which payment is sought was not
8 substantially performed or provided, as applicable.
9 Sec. 65. 1. Not more than once during a single 12-month
10 period, the Department may reevaluate the eligibility of a provider
11 of health care to receive an exemption from the requirement to
12 obtain prior authorization pursuant to section 64 of this act.
13 2. The Department may revoke an exemption from the
14 requirement to obtain prior authorization granted to a provider of
15 health care pursuant to subsection 1 only if the Department
16 determines that the provider of health care would not have met the
17 criteria prescribed in subsection 1 of section 64 of this act for the
18 good or service to which the exemption applies based on:
19 (a) A retrospective review of claims submitted by the provider
20 of health care for that good or service during the immediately
21 preceding 3 months; or
22 (b) If the provider of health care did not submit at least 10
23 claims for that good or service during the immediately preceding 3
24 months, a retrospective review of at least the last 10 claims
25 submitted by the provider of health care for that good or service.
26 3. If it is initially determined that a provider of health care
27 meets the criteria prescribed in subsection 2 for the revocation of
28 an exemption based on a review conducted pursuant to that
29 subsection, the satisfaction of those criteria must be independently
30 determined by a provider of health care described in subsection 2
31 of section 64 of this act before the Department may revoke the
32 exemption.
33 4. If the Department revokes an exemption from the
34 requirement to obtain prior authorization pursuant to subsection
35 2, the Department shall transmit to the provider of health care to
36 which the revocation pertains a notice that includes:
37 (a) The information that the Department relied upon when
38 making the determination described in subsection 2;
39 (b) An identification of each good or service to which the
40 revoked exemption applies;
41 (c) The date on which the revocation takes effect, which must
42 not be earlier than 30 days after the date on which the Department
43 transmits the notice; and
-
*SB398*

– 63 –
1 (d) A description, written in easily comprehensible language,
2 of how the provider of health care may appeal the revocation
3 pursuant to subsection 5.
4 5. The Department shall adopt a procedure by which a
5 provider of health care may appeal the revocation of an exemption
6 from the requirement to obtain prior authorization. If a provider
7 of health care appeals a revocation of such exemption, the
8 exemption must remain in effect:
9 (a) If the revocation is reversed on appeal, until the next
10 reevaluation pursuant to subsection 1 of the eligibility of the
11 provider of health care to continue receiving the exemption.
12 (b) If the revocation is upheld on appeal, until the later of the
13 5th calendar day after the revocation is upheld or the date
14 contained within the notice sent to the provider of health care
15 pursuant to subsection 4.
16 Sec. 66. 1. If the Department violates sections 56 to 63,
17 inclusive, of this act with respect to a particular request for prior
18 authorization, the request shall be deemed approved.
19 2. Any provision of a contract or agreement that conflicts
20 with this section or sections 56 to 65, inclusive, of this act is
21 against public policy, void and unenforceable.
22 Sec. 67. 1. On or before March 1 of each calendar year, the
23 Department shall publish on an Internet website maintained by
24 the Department in an easily accessible format the following
