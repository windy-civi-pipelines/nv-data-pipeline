EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; requiring the use of a rapid test
when testing certain pregnant women for syphilis in
certain circumstances; authorizing the discipline of certain
health care facilities that violate that requirement; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires any medical facility, other than a hospital, and an
2 emergency department or labor and delivery unit in a hospital that is evaluating or
3 treating a pregnant woman to test the pregnant woman for syphilis using a standard
4 serological test, unless the pregnant woman refuses the test or indicates that she has
5 already had certain prenatal screenings and tests. Existing law requires such a
6 facility to treat a patient who tests positive for syphilis or to refer the patient for
7 such treatment, except where the patient refuses treatment. (NRS 442.010) Section
8 1 of this bill requires such a facility to test a pregnant woman who has not received
9 certain prenatal screenings and tests for syphilis using a rapid point-of-contact test
10 instead of a standard serological test unless the pregnant woman refuses the test.
11 Section 1 also clarifies that such a facility must perform a rapid test for syphilis on
12 a pregnant woman, unless the woman refuses the test, regardless of the reason the
13 woman is seeking treatment at the facility. Additionally, certain public and private
14 policies of health insurance, including Medicaid, would be required to cover this
15 rapid test for syphilis performed under the conditions required by section 1. (NRS
16 287.010, 287.04335, 422.27173, 689A.0412, 689B.0315, 689C.1675, 698C.425,
17 695A.1856, 695B.1913, 695C.050, 695C.1737, 695G.1714)
18 Sections 2 and 3 of this bill authorize the Division of Public and Behavioral
19 Health of the Department of Health and Human Services to discipline a medical
20 facility for a violation of section 1.
