Section 1:
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to health care; requiring certain physician
assistants and advanced practice registered nurses to examine
pregnant women for the discovery of syphilis; requiring the
use of a rapid or point-of-care test when testing certain
pregnant women for syphilis in certain circumstances;
requiring certain medical facilities to develop a policy to
ensure compliance with such requirements; exempting certain
medical facilities from requirements relating to testing for
syphilis; authorizing the discipline of certain health care
facilities that violate such requirements; requiring Medicaid
to reimburse for rapid or point-of-care testing for syphilis
performed under certain circumstances separately from
reimbursement for other prenatal care; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law requires every physician attending a pregnant woman during
gestation to make an examination for the discovery of syphilis. Existing law also
requires any medical facility, other than a hospital, and an emergency department
or labor and delivery unit in a hospital that is evaluating or treating a pregnant
woman to test the pregnant woman for syphilis using a standard serological test,
unless the pregnant woman refuses the test or indicates that she has already had the
prenatal screenings and tests recommended by the American College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Existing law requires such a physician or facility
to treat a patient who tests positive for syphilis or to refer the patient for such
treatment, except where the patient refuses treatment. (NRS 442.010) Section 1 of
this bill additionally requires a physician assistant or advanced practice registered
nurse to make an examination for the discovery of syphilis when attending a
pregnant woman during gestation. Section 1 requires certain medical facilities,
other than a hospital, and an emergency department or labor unit of a hospital to
test a pregnant woman who has not received any prenatal screenings and tests for
syphilis, and who does not refuse testing, using a rapid or point-of-care test instead
of a standard serological test unless the results of a serological test are likely to be
available before the woman is discharged or otherwise leaves the facility. Section 1
requires such a facility to perform a serological test if a woman indicates she has a
history of syphilis or refer the woman for such a test. Section 1: (1) clarifies that
such a facility must perform a test for syphilis on a pregnant woman, unless the
woman refuses the test, regardless of the reason the woman is seeking treatment at
the facility; and (2) requires any such refusal to be documented. Section 1 further
requires such a facility to develop a policy to ensure compliance with such testing
requirements and certain recommendations by the American College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists or its successor organization. Section 1
additionally exempts rural clinics that are owned, operated or administered by
certain governmental entities from certain requirements governing testing for
syphilis.
Additionally, certain public and private policies of health insurance, including
Medicaid, would be required to cover rapid or point-of-care testing for syphilis

695C.050, 695C.1737, 695G.1714) Section 3.5 of this bill requires Medicaid, to the
extent federal financial participation is available, to reimburse such testing for
syphilis separately from the other prenatal care the pregnant woman received at the
time of the testing.

Section 3:
Sections 2 and 3 of this bill authorize the Division of Public and Behavioral
Health of the Department of Health and Human Services to discipline a medical
facility for a violation of section 1.

Assembly Bill No. 360–Assemblymember Goulding
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to health care; requiring certain physician
assistants and advanced practice registered nurses to examine
pregnant women for the discovery of syphilis; requiring the
use of a rapid or point-of-care test when testing certain
pregnant women for syphilis in certain circumstances;
requiring certain medical facilities to develop a policy to
ensure compliance with such requirements; exempting certain
medical facilities from requirements relating to testing for
syphilis; authorizing the discipline of certain health care
facilities that violate such requirements; requiring Medicaid
to reimburse for rapid or point-of-care testing for syphilis
performed under certain circumstances separately from
reimbursement for other prenatal care; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law requires every physician attending a pregnant woman during
gestation to make an examination for the discovery of syphilis. Existing law also
requires any medical facility, other than a hospital, and an emergency department
or labor and delivery unit in a hospital that is evaluating or treating a pregnant
woman to test the pregnant woman for syphilis using a standard serological test,
unless the pregnant woman refuses the test or indicates that she has already had the
prenatal screenings and tests recommended by the American College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Existing law requires such a physician or facility
to treat a patient who tests positive for syphilis or to refer the patient for such
treatment, except where the patient refuses treatment. (NRS 442.010) Section 1 of
this bill additionally requires a physician assistant or advanced practice registered
nurse to make an examination for the discovery of syphilis when attending a
pregnant woman during gestation. Section 1 requires certain medical facilities,
other than a hospital, and an emergency department or labor unit of a hospital to
test a pregnant woman who has not received any prenatal screenings and tests for
syphilis, and who does not refuse testing, using a rapid or point-of-care test instead
of a standard serological test unless the results of a serological test are likely to be
available before the woman is discharged or otherwise leaves the facility. Section 1
requires such a facility to perform a serological test if a woman indicates she has a
history of syphilis or refer the woman for such a test. Section 1: (1) clarifies that
such a facility must perform a test for syphilis on a pregnant woman, unless the
woman refuses the test, regardless of the reason the woman is seeking treatment at
the facility; and (2) requires any such refusal to be documented. Section 1 further
requires such a facility to develop a policy to ensure compliance with such testing
requirements and certain recommendations by the American College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists or its successor organization. Section 1
additionally exempts rural clinics that are owned, operated or administered by
certain governmental entities from certain requirements governing testing for
syphilis.
Additionally, certain public and private policies of health insurance, including
Medicaid, would be required to cover rapid or point-of-care testing for syphilis

performed under the conditions required by section 1. (NRS 287.010, 287.04335,
422.27173, 689A.0412, 689B.0315, 689C.1675, 698C.425, 695A.1856, 695B.1913,
695C.050, 695C.1737, 695G.1714) Section 3.5 of this bill requires Medicaid, to the
extent federal financial participation is available, to reimburse such testing for
syphilis separately from the other prenatal care the pregnant woman received at the
time of the testing.
Sections 2 and 3 of this bill authorize the Division of Public and Behavioral
Health of the Department of Health and Human Services to discipline a medical
facility for a violation of section 1.
