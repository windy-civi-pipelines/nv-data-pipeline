~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; requiring certain physician
assistants and advanced practice registered nurses to
examine pregnant women for the discovery of syphilis;
requiring the use of a rapid or point-of-care test when
testing certain pregnant women for syphilis in certain
circumstances; requiring certain medical facilities to
develop a policy to ensure compliance with such
requirements; exempting certain medical facilities from
requirements relating to testing for syphilis; authorizing
the discipline of certain health care facilities that violate
such requirements; requiring Medicaid to reimburse for
rapid or point-of-care testing for syphilis performed under
certain circumstances separately from reimbursement for
other prenatal care; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires every physician attending a pregnant woman during
2 gestation to make an examination for the discovery of syphilis. Existing law also
3 requires any medical facility, other than a hospital, and an emergency department
4 or labor and delivery unit in a hospital that is evaluating or treating a pregnant
5 woman to test the pregnant woman for syphilis using a standard serological test,
6 unless the pregnant woman refuses the test or indicates that she has already had the
7 prenatal screenings and tests recommended by the American College of
8 Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Existing law requires such a physician or facility
9 to treat a patient who tests positive for syphilis or to refer the patient for such
-
*AB360_R1*
– 2 –
10 treatment, except where the patient refuses treatment. (NRS 442.010) Section 1 of
11 this bill additionally requires a physician assistant or advanced practice registered
12 nurse to make an examination for the discovery of syphilis when attending a
13 pregnant woman during gestation. Section 1 requires certain medical facilities,
14 other than a hospital, and an emergency department or labor unit of a hospital to
15 test a pregnant woman who has not received any prenatal screenings and tests for
16 syphilis, and who does not refuse testing, using a rapid or point-of-care test instead
17 of a standard serological test unless the results of a serological test are likely to be
18 available before the woman is discharged or otherwise leaves the facility. Section 1
19 requires such a facility to perform a serological test if a woman indicates she has a
20 history of syphilis or refer the woman for such a test. Section 1: (1) clarifies that
21 such a facility must perform a test for syphilis on a pregnant woman, unless the
22 woman refuses the test, regardless of the reason the woman is seeking treatment at
23 the facility; and (2) requires any such refusal to be documented. Section 1 further
24 requires such a facility to develop a policy to ensure compliance with such testing
25 requirements and certain recommendations by the American College of
26 Obstetricians and Gynecologists or its successor organization. Section 1
27 additionally exempts rural clinics that are owned, operated or administered by
28 certain governmental entities from certain requirements governing testing for
29 syphilis.
30 Additionally, certain public and private policies of health insurance, including
31 Medicaid, would be required to cover rapid or point-of-care testing for syphilis
32 performed under the conditions required by section 1. (NRS 287.010, 287.04335,
33 422.27173, 689A.0412, 689B.0315, 689C.1675, 698C.425, 695A.1856, 695B.1913,
34 695C.050, 695C.1737, 695G.1714) Section 3.5 of this bill requires Medicaid, to the
35 extent federal financial participation is available, to reimburse such testing for
36 syphilis separately from the other prenatal care the pregnant woman received at the
37 time of the testing.
38 Sections 2 and 3 of this bill authorize the Division of Public and Behavioral
39 Health of the Department of Health and Human Services to discipline a medical
40 facility for a violation of section 1.

such requirements; requiring Medicaid to reimburse for
rapid or point-of-care testing for syphilis performed under
certain circumstances separately from reimbursement for
other prenatal care; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires every physician attending a pregnant woman during
2 gestation to make an examination for the discovery of syphilis. Existing law also
3 requires any medical facility, other than a hospital, and an emergency department
4 or labor and delivery unit in a hospital that is evaluating or treating a pregnant
5 woman to test the pregnant woman for syphilis using a standard serological test,
6 unless the pregnant woman refuses the test or indicates that she has already had the
7 prenatal screenings and tests recommended by the American College of
8 Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Existing law requires such a physician or facility
9 to treat a patient who tests positive for syphilis or to refer the patient for such
-

– 2 –
10 treatment, except where the patient refuses treatment. (NRS 442.010) Section 1 of
11 this bill additionally requires a physician assistant or advanced practice registered
12 nurse to make an examination for the discovery of syphilis when attending a
13 pregnant woman during gestation. Section 1 requires certain medical facilities,
14 other than a hospital, and an emergency department or labor unit of a hospital to
15 test a pregnant woman who has not received any prenatal screenings and tests for
16 syphilis, and who does not refuse testing, using a rapid or point-of-care test instead
17 of a standard serological test unless the results of a serological test are likely to be
18 available before the woman is discharged or otherwise leaves the facility. Section 1
19 requires such a facility to perform a serological test if a woman indicates she has a
20 history of syphilis or refer the woman for such a test. Section 1: (1) clarifies that
21 such a facility must perform a test for syphilis on a pregnant woman, unless the
22 woman refuses the test, regardless of the reason the woman is seeking treatment at
23 the facility; and (2) requires any such refusal to be documented. Section 1 further
24 requires such a facility to develop a policy to ensure compliance with such testing
25 requirements and certain recommendations by the American College of
26 Obstetricians and Gynecologists or its successor organization. Section 1
27 additionally exempts rural clinics that are owned, operated or administered by
28 certain governmental entities from certain requirements governing testing for
29 syphilis.
30 Additionally, certain public and private policies of health insurance, including
31 Medicaid, would be required to cover rapid or point-of-care testing for syphilis
32 performed under the conditions required by section 1. (NRS 287.010, 287.04335,
33 422.27173, 689A.0412, 689B.0315, 689C.1675, 698C.425, 695A.1856, 695B.1913,
34 695C.050, 695C.1737, 695G.1714) Section 3.5 of this bill requires Medicaid, to the
35 extent federal financial participation is available, to reimburse such testing for
36 syphilis separately from the other prenatal care the pregnant woman received at the
37 time of the testing.
38 Sections 2 and 3 of this bill authorize the Division of Public and Behavioral
39 Health of the Department of Health and Human Services to discipline a medical
40 facility for a violation of section 1.
