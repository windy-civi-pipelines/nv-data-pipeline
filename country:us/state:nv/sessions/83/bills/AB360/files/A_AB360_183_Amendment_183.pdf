AN ACT relating to health care; requiring certain physician assistants and
advanced practice registered nurses to examine pregnant women
for the discovery of syphilis; requiring the use of a rapid or point-of-
care test when testing certain pregnant women for syphilis in certain
circumstances; requiring certain medical facilities to develop a
policy to ensure compliance with such requirements; exempting
certain medical facilities from requirements relating to testing for
syphilis; authorizing the discipline of certain health care facilities that
violate [that requirement;] such requirements; requiring Medicaid to
reimburse for rapid or point-of-care testing for syphilis performed
under certain circumstances separately from reimbursement for
other prenatal care; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires every physician attending a pregnant woman during gestation
2 to make an examination for the discovery of syphilis. Existing law also requires any
3 medical facility, other than a hospital, and an emergency department or labor and delivery unit
4 in a hospital that is evaluating or treating a pregnant woman to test the pregnant woman for
5 syphilis using a standard serological test, unless the pregnant woman refuses the test or
6 indicates that she has already had [certain] the prenatal screenings and tests [.] recommended
7 by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Existing law requires such a
8 physician or facility to treat a patient who tests positive for syphilis or to refer the patient for
9 such treatment, except where the patient refuses treatment. (NRS 442.010) Section 1 of this
10 bill additionally requires a physician assistant or advanced practice registered nurse to
11 make an examination for the discovery of syphilis when attending a pregnant woman
12 during gestation. Section 1 requires [such a facility] certain medical facilities, other than a
13 hospital, and an emergency department or labor unit of a hospital to test a pregnant
14 woman who has not received [certain] any prenatal screenings and tests for syphilis , and
15 who does not refuse testing , using a rapid [point-of-contact] or point-of-care test instead of

Assembly Amendment No. 183 to Assembly Bill No. 360 Page 4
16 a standard serological test unless [the pregnant woman refuses] the results of a serological
17 test [.] are likely to be available before the woman is discharged or otherwise leaves the
18 facility. Section 1 requires such a facility to perform a serological test if a woman
19 indicates she has a history of syphilis or refer the woman for such a test. Section 1 [also] :
20 (1) clarifies that such a facility must perform a [rapid] test for syphilis on a pregnant woman,
21 unless the woman refuses the test, regardless of the reason the woman is seeking treatment at
22 the facility [.] ; and (2) requires any such refusal to be documented. Section 1 further
23 requires such a facility to develop a policy to ensure compliance with such testing
24 requirements and certain recommendations by the American College of Obstetricians
25 and Gynecologists or its successor organization. Section 1 additionally exempts rural
26 clinics that are owned, operated or administered by certain governmental entities from
27 certain requirements governing testing for syphilis.
28 Additionally, certain public and private policies of health insurance, including Medicaid,
29 would be required to cover [this] rapid [test] or point-of-care testing for syphilis performed
30 under the conditions required by section 1. (NRS 287.010, 287.04335, 422.27173,
31 689A.0412, 689B.0315, 689C.1675, 698C.425, 695A.1856, 695B.1913, 695C.050,
32 695C.1737, 695G.1714) Section 3.5 of this bill requires Medicaid, to the extent federal
33 financial participation is available, to reimburse such testing for syphilis separately from
34 the other prenatal care the pregnant woman received at the time of the testing.
35 Sections 2 and 3 of this bill authorize the Division of Public and Behavioral Health of the
36 Department of Health and Human Services to discipline a medical facility for a violation of
37 section 1.
