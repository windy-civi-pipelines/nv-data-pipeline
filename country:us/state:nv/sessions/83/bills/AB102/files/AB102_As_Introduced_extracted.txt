3 health district in counties whose population is less than 700,000 (currently all
4 counties other than Clark County) under certain circumstances. (NRS 439.361,
5 439.362, 439.369, 439.370) Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation
6 of emergency medical services by: (1) in a county whose population is 700,000 or

19 he or she meets the qualifications prescribed by law.
20 Existing law: (1) prohibits the owner of an ambulance from allowing a person
21 to operate or use the ambulance if the person is not licensed as an attendant; and (2)
22 requires an ambulance carrying a sick or injured patient to be occupied by a driver
23 and attendant, both of whom must be licensed as attendants. (NRS 450B.260)

14 medical care provided by an advanced emergency medical
15 technician or paramedic to sick or injured persons:
16 (a) At the scene of an emergency unless at least one person in
17 the vehicle is licensed to provide the care; or
18 (b) While transporting those persons to a medical facility unless
19 at least two persons in the vehicle are licensed to provide the care.
20 6. The board may not require that a person who is

23 technician or paramedic be licensed as an attendant pursuant to
24 this chapter in order to occupy an ambulance that is being used to
25 provide medical care to sick or injured persons at the scene of an
26 emergency or while transporting a sick or injured person so long

28 (a) The ambulance is otherwise staffed in accordance with the
29 provisions of this chapter and any regulations adopted pursuant
30 thereto; and
31 (b) The unlicensed person does not provide care to a sick or
32 injured person or drive the ambulance.
33 7. Nothing in this section precludes the operation of an aircraft
34 in this State in a manner other than as an air ambulance.

36 with the amendatory provisions of this act are void. The Legislative
37 Counsel shall remove those regulations from the Nevada
38 Administrative Code as soon as practicable after July 1, 2025.
39 2. As used in this section, “board” has the meaning ascribed to
40 it in NRS 450B.060, as amended by section 4 of this act.
