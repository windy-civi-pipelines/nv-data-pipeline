EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to emergency medical services; authorizing a district board of
health in certain health districts to regulate emergency medical services
within the district [;] with certain exceptions; providing that certain
persons are eligible for licensure as an attendant of an ambulance or air
ambulance or certification as an emergency medical technician;
revising provisions governing persons who are authorized to occupy an
ambulance; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law: (1) creates a health district in each county whose population is 700,000 or
2 more (currently only Clark County); and (2) authorizes the creation of a health district in
3 counties whose population is less than 700,000 (currently all counties other than Clark
4 County) under certain circumstances. (NRS 439.361, 439.362, 439.369, 439.370) Existing law
5 provides for the licensure and regulation of emergency medical services by: (1) in a county
6 whose population is 700,000 or more, the district board of health; and (2) in all other counties,
7 the State Board of Health and the Division of Public and Behavioral Health of the Department
8 of Health and Human Services. (NRS 450B.060, 450B.077, 450B.120, 450B.160) Sections 1-
9 6, 9 and 10 of this bill authorize a district board of health in a health district that includes a
10 county whose population is 100,000 or more but less than 700,000 (currently only Washoe
11 County) to elect, by affirmative vote of a majority of all the members of the board, to regulate
12 emergency medical services within the district in the same manner as a county whose
13 population is 700,000 or more. However, section 10.5 of this bill prohibits a district board
14 of health in a health district that elects to regulate emergency medical services from
15 establishing a program for the treatment of trauma, thereby keeping the program for
16 the treatment of trauma in such a health district under the authority of the State Board
17 of Health.
18 Existing law sets forth the requirements to obtain a license as an attendant of an
19 ambulance or air ambulance or certification as an emergency medical technician. (NRS
20 450B.160, 450B.180, 450B.1905) Sections 7 and 8 of this bill provide that a person who is at

Assembly Amendment No. 20 to Assembly Bill No. 102 Page 4
21 least 16 years of age is eligible for such a license or certificate if he or she meets the
22 qualifications prescribed by law.
23 Existing law: (1) prohibits the owner of an ambulance from allowing a person to operate
24 or use the ambulance if the person is not licensed as an attendant; and (2) requires an
25 ambulance carrying a sick or injured patient to be occupied by a driver and attendant, both of
26 whom must be licensed as attendants. (NRS 450B.260) Section 11 of this bill prohibits the
27 State Board of Health or a district board of health from requiring that a person who is
28 participating in a program of training for certification as an emergency medical technician,
29 advanced emergency medical technician or paramedic be licensed as an attendant in order to
30 occupy an ambulance that is providing care or transporting a sick or injured person so long as:
31 (1) the ambulance is otherwise properly staffed; and (2) the person is not providing care to a
32 sick or injured person or driving the ambulance.
