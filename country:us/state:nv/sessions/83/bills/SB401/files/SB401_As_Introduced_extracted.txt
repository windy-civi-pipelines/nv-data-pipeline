Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 The Community Redevelopment Law prescribes procedures for the elimination
2 of blighted areas in cities and counties. (Chapter 279 of NRS) Under this Law, the
3 governing body of a city or county is authorized to adopt a plan for the
4 redevelopment of an area of the city or county that contains such blighted areas.
5 (NRS 279.516-279.609) With certain exceptions, existing law requires the
6 termination of a redevelopment plan, and any amendments to the plan, adopted on
7 or after January 1, 1991, not later than 30 years after the date on which the original
8 redevelopment plan is adopted. (NRS 279.439) This bill extends to a maximum of
9 50 years the date of termination of such a redevelopment plan, and any
10 amendments to the plan, adopted by a city whose population is 150,000 or more
11 located in a county whose population is 100,000 or more but less than 700,000
12 (currently only the City of Reno).
