EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to taxation; authorizing, under certain
circumstances, the reimbursement of costs incurred by
certain smaller counties related to certain activities
provided by a tax-exempt organization or nonprofit
corporation that are subject to the excise tax on live
entertainment; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 With certain exceptions, existing law imposes an excise tax on admission to
2 certain areas or premises, whether indoor or outdoor, where live entertainment is
3 provided. (Chapter 368A of NRS) Under existing law, with certain exceptions, all
4 taxes, interest and penalties received from the tax on live entertainment are required
5 to be deposited in the State Treasury for credit to the State General Fund. (NRS
6 368A.220) Depending on the number of tickets that are offered for sale or other
7 distribution, the tax on live entertainment does not apply under existing law to
8 certain activities provided by a nonprofit religious, charitable, fraternal or other
9 organization that qualifies as a tax-exempt organization pursuant to certain federal
10 law or a nonprofit corporation organized or existing under certain state law. (NRS
11 368A.090, 368A.200)
12 If such a tax-exempt organization or nonprofit corporation provides an activity
13 that is taxable as live entertainment in a county whose population is less than 9,000
14 (currently Esmeralda, Eureka, Lander, Lincoln, Mineral, Pershing and Storey
15 Counties) and the number of tickets to the activity offered for sale or other
16 distribution is 15,000 or more, this bill, with certain exceptions, authorizes the
17 board of county commissioners of the county to submit an application to the
18 Department of Taxation for reimbursement of costs incurred by the county related

19 to the activity. This bill prohibits such a board of county commissioners from
20 requesting reimbursement for: (1) any costs related to the activity that were paid
21 for, or for which the county was reimbursed, by the tax-exempt organization or
22 nonprofit corporation; (2) indirect or incidental costs incurred by the county related
23 to the activity in an amount more than 20 percent of the total direct costs incurred
24 by the county related to the activity; and (3) more than $750,000 in total direct,
25 indirect and incidental costs incurred by the county in a fiscal year related to
26 activities for which the county is authorized to apply for reimbursement of costs
27 under this bill. Finally, this bill: (1) requires the Executive Director of the
28 Department of Taxation to review any such application for completeness and
29 compliance with the requirements of this bill and to submit any complete and
30 compliant application to the Nevada Tax Commission for approval or denial; (2)
31 authorizes the payment of the amount of the reimbursement approved by the
32 Nevada Tax Commission to the applicable county from the State General Fund; and
33 (3) authorizes a board of county commissioners to appeal any denial of such an
34 application by the Nevada Tax Commission.
