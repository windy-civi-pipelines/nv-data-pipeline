AN ACT relating to criminal procedure; providing that the

4 person who has: (1) barricaded himself or herself, resulting in an imminent risk of
5 harm to the life of another person; (2) created a hostage situation; or (3) threatened
6 the imminent illegal use of an explosive. (NRS 179.463, 200.620) Sections 3 and 6
7 of this bill similarly provide that the interception, listening or recording of a wire,
8 electronic or oral communication by a peace officer or certain persons acting under
9 the direction or request of a peace officer is not unlawful if the peace officer or
10 person is intercepting the communication for the sole purpose of investigating a
11 sexual offense against a child. Section 2 of this bill defines the term “sexual offense
12 against a child” for purposes of section 3 and certain other provisions of existing
13 law relating to the interception of communications. Section 4 of this bill makes
14 certain definitions prescribed by existing law applicable to sections 2 and 3.
