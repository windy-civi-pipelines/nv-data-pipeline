AN ACT relating to juvenile justice; requiring certain facilities to which a juvenile
court commits a child to adopt and implement certain policies and
procedures relating to unclothed searches of children who are detained
in or committed to the facility; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides certain rights to children who are detained in a detention facility,
2 including, without limitation, the right to be: (1) treated with basic human dignity and respect,
3 without intentional infliction of humiliation; and (2) free from searches conducted for the
4 purpose of harassment, punishment or discipline. (NRS 62B.510) Section 1 of this bill
5 requires each regional facility for the treatment and rehabilitation of children and local facility
6 for the detention of children to adopt and implement policies and procedures concerning
7 unclothed searches of children who are detained in or committed to the facility. Section 1
8 requires any such policy or procedure to: (1) prohibit unclothed searches of children who are
9 detained in or committed to such a facility, except under [extraordinary] certain
10 circumstances; and (2) include certain requirements governing any unclothed search of a child
11 who is detained in or committed to such a facility. Section 2 of this bill imposes the same
12 requirements on each state facility for the detention of children.
