EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; authorizing a private school that
provides certain health care services to a child placed in
the school under certain circumstances to request
reimbursement from the school district or charter school
in which the child was enrolled; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, certain hospitals and other facilities that are licensed in this
2 State to provide residential treatment to children and also operate a licensed private
3 school are authorized to request reimbursement from the school district or charter
4 school in which a child is enrolled for the cost of providing educational services to
5 a child who is verified to be a patient or resident of the hospital or facility and who
6 attends the private school for more than 7 school days. (NRS 387.1225) Upon
7 receiving such a request for reimbursement, a school district or charter school is
8 required to determine the amount of the reimbursement owed to the hospital or
9 other facility by converting the adjusted base per pupil funding or the statewide
10 base per pupil funding amount, as applicable, for the school district or charter
11 school that the child would otherwise attend into a daily rate. If the child is a pupil
12 with a disability and the hospital or facility meets certain requirements, the daily
13 rate of reimbursement to which the hospital or facility is entitled is increased by the
14 statewide multiplier for the pupil. (NRS 387.1225) The statewide base per pupil
15 funding amount, adjusted base per pupil funding and statewide multiplier are
16 established pursuant to the Pupil-Centered Funding Plan, which is the formula for
17 the distribution of state financial aid to public schools in this State. (NRS 387.121,
18 387.1214, 387.122)
19 Section 1 of this bill likewise authorizes a hospital or other facility that is
20 licensed in this State, operates a licensed private school and provides outpatient,

21 rather than residential, treatment to a child to request such reimbursement from the
22 school district or charter school in which the child is enrolled if: (1) the school
23 district or charter school verifies that the child is a patient of the hospital or facility;
24 (2) the child attends the private school for more than 7 school days; and (3) the
25 child is a pupil with a disability who previously received special education and
26 related services under the authority of the school district or charter school in which
27 the child is enrolled.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

8 the school district or charter school in which a child is enrolled for
9 the cost of providing educational services to the child if:
10 (a) The school district or charter school verifies that the child is
11 a patient or resident of the hospital or facility; [and]
12 (b) The child attends the private school for more than 7 school
13 days [.] ; and
14 (c) For a child who receives only outpatient and not residential

17 school district or charter school for the cost of providing educational

20 be deemed to be the local educational agency for the child for the
21 purposes of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, 20
22 U.S.C. §§ 1400 et seq., NRS 388.417 to 388.5243, inclusive, and
