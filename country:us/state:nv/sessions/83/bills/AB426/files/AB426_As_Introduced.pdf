Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides that each public school within a school district in this

4 388G.530, 388G.600) Existing law requires the principal of a local school precinct
5 to: (1) establish an organizational team for the local school precinct; (2) develop a
6 plan of operation that contains a budget for the use of money allocated to the local
7 school precinct; (3) present the plan at a public meeting before the organizational
8 team conducts a vote to approve the plan; and (4) if at least 75 percent of the
9 members of the organizational team vote to approve the plan of operation, submit
10 the plan to the school associate superintendent for approval. (NRS 388G.700)
11 Section 2 of this bill requires, for each meeting at which the organizational team is
12 scheduled to vote on approval of the plan of operation, the principal to: (1) at least

20 agenda; and (2) sets forth certain requirements governing the posting of the agenda
21 and minutes and plan of operation on various Internet websites maintained by the
22 large school district or the local school precinct. Finally, section 3 provides that: (1)
23 after the plan of operation has been approved, if the principal determines that an
24 adjustment to the budget is necessary, he or she must, instead of consulting with the
25 organizational team, obtain the approval of the organizational team and school
26 associate superintendent for any adjustment to the budget in an amount of at least
27 $1,000; and (2) any expenditure of money generated by pupils enrolled at the local
28 school precinct must be approved by the organizational team. (NRS 388G.710)
29 Existing law requires the organizational team for a local school precinct to
30 include elected members who are: (1) teachers or other licensed educational
31 personnel at the local school precinct; (2) employees of the local school precinct

39 the large school district with a directory of contact information for members of each
40 organizational team within the large school district.
41 Existing law sets forth certain requirements governing meetings of
42 organizational teams and the terms of members of organizational teams. (NRS
43 388G.730) Section 5 of this bill: (1) sets forth certain requirements for the school
44 associate superintendent who oversees the local school precinct concerning such
45 meetings; (2) provides that the term of a member of an organizational team who is
46 the parent or legal guardian of a pupil enrolled in the local school precinct does not
47 expire because his or her child is no longer enrolled at the local school precinct; and
48 (3) sets forth when an alternate member must fill a vacancy in the organizational
49 team.
50 Existing law sets forth certain duties that the organizational team and
51 superintendent of the large school district are required to carry out when a vacancy
52 occurs in the position of principal for a local school precinct. (NRS 388G.740)
53 Section 6 of this bill: (1) requires the organizational team to conduct a meeting to
54 obtain input from the public concerning the vacancy; (2) sets forth requirements for
55 how the organizational team and superintendent must use the list of qualifications
56 for candidates prepared by the organizational team; (3) requires the superintendent
57 to provide information to certain entities regarding the reason that a candidate was
58 not selected; and (4) requires the organizational team to hold a meeting to introduce
59 the person selected to serve as principal.
60 Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district to submit to
61 the Superintendent of Public Instruction and the Department of Taxation an annual
62 report containing certain information concerning budgets and expenditures. (NRS
63 387.303) Section 1 of this bill requires the principal of a local school precinct to
64 provide the organizational team with a briefing containing certain information
65 contained in the report.

21 one member elected pursuant to paragraph (d) of subsection 1 of
22 NRS 388G.720. Such an interview must not be conducted unless at
23 least two members of the organizational team are present at the
24 interview.
25 5. From the list of candidates submitted by the superintendent
26 pursuant to subsection 4, the organizational team shall rank the
27 candidates for the position of principal by preference and submit a
28 list with that ranking within 15 school days after receipt of the
29 recommendation. The superintendent, in consultation with the
30 school associate superintendent, must select a candidate to hire for
31 the position of principal. Before any vote on the selected candidate,
32 the school associate superintendent responsible for the local school
33 precinct must make every effort to notify the members of the
34 organizational team for the local school precinct of the date, time
35 and location of the scheduled vote. The organizational team may
36 reject the selection of the candidate if at least 75 percent of the
37 members of the organizational team who are present at the time of
38 the vote elect to do so. The superintendent must then select a
39 candidate from the remaining members of the list submitted
40 pursuant to subsection 4. Not later than 10 days after the selection
41 of a candidate, the organizational team must hold a meeting at the
42 local school precinct to introduce the candidate selected to serve as
