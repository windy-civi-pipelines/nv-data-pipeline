21 and minutes and plan of operation on various Internet websites maintained by the
22 large school district or the local school precinct. Finally, section 3 provides that: (1)
23 after the plan of operation has been approved, if the principal determines that an
24 adjustment to the budget is necessary, the adjustment may not be made unless the
25 principal notifies the organizational team and conducts a meeting of the
26 organizational team and school associate superintendent for any adjustment to
27 the budget in an amount of at least $80,000 for an elementary or middle school or
28 $125,000 for a high school; and (2) any expenditure of money generated by pupils

45 388G.730) Section 5 of this bill: (1) sets forth certain requirements for the school
46 associate superintendent who oversees the local school precinct concerning such
47 meetings; and (2) sets forth the procedure to fill a vacancy in the organizational
48 team from among the candidates who received votes in elections for members of
49 the organizational team.
50 Existing law sets forth certain duties that the organizational team and
51 superintendent of the large school district are required to carry out when a vacancy
