Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides that each public school within a school district in this State which
2 has more than 100,000 pupils enrolled in its public schools (currently the Clark County
3 School District) is deemed to be a local school precinct. (NRS 388G.530, 388G.600) Existing
4 law requires the principal of a local school precinct to: (1) establish an organizational team for
5 the local school precinct; (2) develop a plan of operation that contains a budget for the use of
6 money allocated to the local school precinct; (3) present the plan at a public meeting before
7 the organizational team conducts a vote to approve the plan; and (4) if at least 75 percent of
8 the members of the organizational team vote to approve the plan of operation, submit the plan
9 to the school associate superintendent for approval. (NRS 388G.700) Section 2 of this bill
10 requires, for each meeting at which the organizational team is scheduled to vote on approval
11 of the plan of operation, the principal to: (1) at least 3 days before the meeting, send a copy of
12 the budget included in such a plan to the members of the organizational team through
13 electronic mail; and (2) provide the organizational team with a report containing information
14 regarding certain expenditures. Section 3 of this bill: (1) requires the principal to, at least 3

21 approved, if the principal determines that an adjustment to the budget is necessary, [he or she
22 must, instead of consulting with the organizational team, obtain the approval of] the
Assembly Amendment No. 428 to Assembly Bill No. 426 Page 4
23 adjustment may not be made unless the principal notifies the organizational team and
24 conducts a meeting of the organizational team and school associate superintendent for any
25 adjustment to the budget in an amount of at least [$1,000;] $80,000 for an elementary or
26 middle school or $125,000 for a high school; and (2) any expenditure of money generated

38 district with a directory of contact information for members of each organizational team
39 within the large school district.
40 Existing law sets forth certain requirements governing meetings of organizational teams
41 and the terms of members of organizational teams. (NRS 388G.730) Section 5 of this bill: (1)
42 sets forth certain requirements for the school associate superintendent who oversees the local
43 school precinct concerning such meetings; and (2) [provides that the term of a member of an
44 organizational team who is the parent or legal guardian of a pupil enrolled in the local school
45 precinct does not expire because his or her child is no longer enrolled at the local school
46 precinct; and (3)] sets forth [when an alternate member must] the procedure to fill a vacancy

48 for members of the organizational team.
49 Existing law sets forth certain duties that the organizational team and superintendent of
50 the large school district are required to carry out when a vacancy occurs in the position of

59 Superintendent of Public Instruction and the Department of Taxation an annual report
60 containing certain information concerning budgets and expenditures. (NRS 387.303) Section

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides that each public school within a school district in this State which
2 has more than 100,000 pupils enrolled in its public schools (currently the Clark County
3 School District) is deemed to be a local school precinct. (NRS 388G.530, 388G.600) Existing
4 law requires the principal of a local school precinct to: (1) establish an organizational team for
5 the local school precinct; (2) develop a plan of operation that contains a budget for the use of
6 money allocated to the local school precinct; (3) present the plan at a public meeting before
7 the organizational team conducts a vote to approve the plan; and (4) if at least 75 percent of
8 the members of the organizational team vote to approve the plan of operation, submit the plan
9 to the school associate superintendent for approval. (NRS 388G.700) Section 2 of this bill
10 requires, for each meeting at which the organizational team is scheduled to vote on approval
11 of the plan of operation, the principal to: (1) at least 3 days before the meeting, send a copy of
12 the budget included in such a plan to the members of the organizational team through
13 electronic mail; and (2) provide the organizational team with a report containing information
14 regarding certain expenditures. Section 3 of this bill: (1) requires the principal to, at least 3
15 working days before holding a public meeting to present a plan of operation, send a copy of
16 the agenda to the parents or legal guardian of a pupil enrolled in the local school precinct
17 unless the parents or legal guardian have opted not to receive a copy of the agenda; and (2)
18 sets forth certain requirements governing the posting of the agenda and minutes and plan of
19 operation on various Internet websites maintained by the large school district or the local
20 school precinct. Finally, section 3 provides that: (1) after the plan of operation has been
21 approved, if the principal determines that an adjustment to the budget is necessary, [he or she
22 must, instead of consulting with the organizational team, obtain the approval of] the

Assembly Amendment No. 428 to Assembly Bill No. 426 Page 4
23 adjustment may not be made unless the principal notifies the organizational team and
24 conducts a meeting of the organizational team and school associate superintendent for any
25 adjustment to the budget in an amount of at least [$1,000;] $80,000 for an elementary or
26 middle school or $125,000 for a high school; and (2) any expenditure of money generated
27 by pupils enrolled at the local school precinct must be approved by the organizational team.
28 (NRS 388G.710)
29 Existing law requires the organizational team for a local school precinct to include elected
30 members who are: (1) teachers or other licensed educational personnel at the local school
31 precinct; (2) employees of the local school precinct who are not teachers or other licensed
32 educational personnel; and (3) parents or legal guardians of pupils enrolled at the local school
33 precinct. (NRS 388G.720) Section 4 of this bill: (1) prohibits the principal of a local school
34 precinct from being elected as a member of an organizational team in any capacity other than
35 as principal; and (2) provides for the designation of certain alternate members in the event of a
36 vacancy. Section 4 additionally requires the superintendent of the large school district to
37 provide the [Department of Education and the board of trustees] staff of the large school
38 district with a directory of contact information for members of each organizational team
39 within the large school district.
40 Existing law sets forth certain requirements governing meetings of organizational teams
41 and the terms of members of organizational teams. (NRS 388G.730) Section 5 of this bill: (1)
42 sets forth certain requirements for the school associate superintendent who oversees the local
43 school precinct concerning such meetings; and (2) [provides that the term of a member of an
44 organizational team who is the parent or legal guardian of a pupil enrolled in the local school
45 precinct does not expire because his or her child is no longer enrolled at the local school
46 precinct; and (3)] sets forth [when an alternate member must] the procedure to fill a vacancy
47 in the organizational team [.] from among the candidates who received votes in elections
48 for members of the organizational team.
49 Existing law sets forth certain duties that the organizational team and superintendent of
50 the large school district are required to carry out when a vacancy occurs in the position of
51 principal for a local school precinct. (NRS 388G.740) Section 6 of this bill: (1) requires the
52 organizational team to conduct a meeting to obtain input from the public concerning the
53 vacancy; (2) sets forth requirements for how the organizational team and superintendent must
54 use the list of qualifications for candidates prepared by the organizational team; and (3)
55 [requires the superintendent to provide information to certain entities regarding the reason that
56 a candidate was not selected; and (4)] requires the organizational team to hold a meeting to
57 introduce the person selected to serve as principal.
58 Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district to submit to the
59 Superintendent of Public Instruction and the Department of Taxation an annual report
60 containing certain information concerning budgets and expenditures. (NRS 387.303) Section
61 1 of this bill requires the principal of a local school precinct to provide the organizational team
62 with a briefing containing certain information contained in the report.
