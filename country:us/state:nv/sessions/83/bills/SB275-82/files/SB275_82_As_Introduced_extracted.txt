EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to manufactured home parks; requiring the
Housing Division of the Department of Business and
Industry to calculate annually and publish a maximum
annual rent increase percentage in manufactured home
parks; authorizing certain persons to apply for an
exemption to certain requirements relating to increases in
rent; revising certain requirements related to increases in
rent for certain tenancies in manufactured home parks;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes certain requirements relating to manufactured home
2 parks. (Chapter 118B of NRS) Existing law prohibits a landlord or his or her agent
3 or employee from increasing rent or additional charges unless the increased rent is
4 the same rent charged for manufactured homes of the same size or lots of the same
5 size or of a similar location within the park, except that a discount may be given to
6 certain persons. (NRS 118B.150) Section 6 of this bill prohibits a landlord or his or
7 her agent or employee from increasing rent for a tenancy that is from month to
8 month and not a long-term lease unless the amount of the increase does not exceed
9 the maximum annual rent increase percentage calculated by the Housing Division
10 of the Department of Business and Industry, plus the amount of pass-through
11 expenses actually incurred by the landlord of the manufactured home park.
12 Section 4 of this bill: (1) authorizes a landlord or his or her agent or employee
13 to apply to the Division for an exemption from this limit on the maximum annual
14 rent increase if the operating costs of the manufactured home park exceed the
15 amount the park would earn with the increase in rent; (2) requires an application for
16 an exemption to include any proof necessary to justify an exemption and a report
17 that demonstrates the need for an exemption prepared by a certified public
18 accountant; and (3) requires the Division to adopt regulations to establish the
19 application process.

25 maximum annual rent increase percentage.
26 Section 2 of this bill defines “maximum annual rent increase percentage” to

3 tenancy that is from month to month and not a long-term lease
4 unless the amount of the increase does not exceed the maximum
5 annual rent increase percentage calculated by the Division
6 pursuant to section 3 of this act that is in effect at the time the
7 landlord or his or her agent or employee is required to provide
8 notice of an increase pursuant to subparagraph (3) of paragraph
9 (a), plus the amount of pass-through expenses actually incurred
10 by the landlord of the manufactured home park.
11 (c) Require a tenant to pay for an improvement to the common
12 area of a manufactured home park unless the landlord is required to
13 make the improvement pursuant to an ordinance of a local

15 [(c)] (d) Require a tenant to pay for a capital improvement to
16 the manufactured home park unless the tenant has notice of the
17 requirement at the time the tenant enters into the rental agreement.
18 A tenant may not be required to pay for a capital improvement after

26 the representative of a public officer or candidate for public office

30 trim the trees on his or her lot, require the tenant to trim any
31 particular tree located on the lot or dispose of the trimmings unless a
32 danger or hazard exists.

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes certain requirements relating to manufactured home

5 size or of a similar location within the park, except that a discount may be given to
6 certain persons. (NRS 118B.150) Section 6 of this bill prohibits a landlord or his or
7 her agent or employee from increasing rent for a tenancy that is from month to
8 month and not a long-term lease unless the amount of the increase does not exceed
9 the maximum annual rent increase percentage calculated by the Housing Division
10 of the Department of Business and Industry, plus the amount of pass-through
11 expenses actually incurred by the landlord of the manufactured home park.
12 Section 4 of this bill: (1) authorizes a landlord or his or her agent or employee
13 to apply to the Division for an exemption from this limit on the maximum annual
14 rent increase if the operating costs of the manufactured home park exceed the
15 amount the park would earn with the increase in rent; (2) requires an application for
16 an exemption to include any proof necessary to justify an exemption and a report
17 that demonstrates the need for an exemption prepared by a certified public
18 accountant; and (3) requires the Division to adopt regulations to establish the
19 application process.

1 (b) Except as otherwise provided in section 4 of this act and in
2 addition to the requirements of paragraph (a), increase rent for a
3 tenancy that is from month to month and not a long-term lease
4 unless the amount of the increase does not exceed the maximum
5 annual rent increase percentage calculated by the Division
6 pursuant to section 3 of this act that is in effect at the time the
7 landlord or his or her agent or employee is required to provide
8 notice of an increase pursuant to subparagraph (3) of paragraph
9 (a), plus the amount of pass-through expenses actually incurred
10 by the landlord of the manufactured home park.
11 (c) Require a tenant to pay for an improvement to the common
12 area of a manufactured home park unless the landlord is required to
13 make the improvement pursuant to an ordinance of a local
14 government.
15 [(c)] (d) Require a tenant to pay for a capital improvement to
16 the manufactured home park unless the tenant has notice of the
17 requirement at the time the tenant enters into the rental agreement.
18 A tenant may not be required to pay for a capital improvement after
19 the tenant enters into the rental agreement unless the tenant consents
20 to it in writing or is given 60 days’ notice of the requirement in
21 writing. The landlord may not establish such a requirement unless a
22 meeting of the tenants is held to discuss the proposal and the
23 landlord provides each tenant with notice of the proposal and
24 the date, time and place of the meeting not less than 60 days before
25 the meeting. The notice must include a copy of the proposal. A
26 notice in a periodic publication of the park does not constitute notice
27 for the purposes of this paragraph.
28 [(d)] (e) Require a tenant to pay the rent by check or money
29 order.
30 [(e)] (f) Require a tenant who pays the rent in cash to apply any
31 change to which the tenant is entitled to the next periodic payment
32 that is due. The landlord or his or her agent or employee shall have
33 an adequate amount of money available to provide change to such a
34 tenant.

40 and when the facility is not otherwise in use, or prohibit the
41 distribution of notices of those meetings.
42 [(g)] (h) Interrupt, with the intent to terminate occupancy, any
43 utility service furnished the tenant except for nonpayment of utility
44 charges when due. Any landlord who violates this paragraph is
45 liable to the tenant for actual damages.

4 is a secured park, a guest may be required to register upon entering
5 and leaving.
6 [(i)] (j) Charge a fee for a guest who does not stay with the
7 tenant for more than a total of 60 days in a calendar year. The tenant
8 of a manufactured home lot who is living alone may allow one other
