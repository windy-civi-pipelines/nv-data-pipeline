12 supportive housing in the local communities in which the health maintenance
13 organization operates.
14 Existing law establishes a reinvestment advisory committee in each county of
15 this State whose population is 700,000 or more (currently only Clark County) and
16 prescribes the duties of a reinvestment advisory committee, which includes
17 reviewing, making recommendations and reporting to the Legislature and Director
18 of the Department concerning the reinvestment of funds by a health maintenance
19 organization that provides health care services through managed care to recipients
20 of Medicaid in the communities served by those organizations. (NRS 422.185,
21 422.205) Section 1 of this bill revises the duties of the reinvestment advisory
22 committee such that the recommendations and reports of the advisory committee
23 are required to concern the reinvestment of funds by managed care organizations to
24 address homelessness and to provide sustainable medication and prescription
25 services, alcohol or drug intervention or rehabilitation services, and emergency and
26 supportive housing, in conformance with the amendatory provisions of sections 2
27 and 3.
28 Existing federal law establishes a Continuum of Care Program to provide
29 funding for efforts by nonprofit providers, states, and local governments to quickly
30 rehouse homeless individuals and families. (42 U.S.C. 11381 et seq.; 24 C.F.R. Part
31 578) Federal law requires representatives from relevant organizations to establish a
32 Continuum of Care for a geographic area to carry out certain responsibilities and to

34 of this bill: (1) requires the Department to establish the Fiscal Advisory Committee
35 for a Flexible Continuum of Care Plan; (2) authorizes the Department to make
36 grants of money to the Advisory Committee to fund certain services; and (3)
37 requires the Advisory Committee to prepare an annual report. Section 3.3 requires

39 amount of money which is not less than $1,000,000 but not more than $2,000,000
40 to the Department each fiscal year for allocation to the Advisory Committee to fund
41 programs to address homelessness in the service area of the Continuum of Care in
42 which the city is located. Section 3.3 requires the Department to assist the Advisory
43 Committee to enter into service agreements with federally-qualified health centers.
44 Sections 7.1-7.9 of this bill make appropriations to the Department for
45 allocation to the Advisory Committee to carry out the provisions of section 3.3.

(NOT REQUESTED BY AFFECTED LOCAL GOVERNMENT)
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public welfare; revising provisions governing
the duties of a reinvestment advisory committee; revising
provisions governing contracts entered into by the
Department of Health and Human Services for the
operation of a Medicaid managed care program; requiring
the Department to establish the Fiscal Advisory
Committee for a Flexible Continuum of Care Plan;
making appropriations; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Department of Health and Human Services, to the
2 extent that money is available, to: (1) establish a Medicaid managed care program
3 to provide health care services to recipients of Medicaid in all geographic areas of
4 this State; and (2) conduct a statewide procurement process to select health
5 maintenance organizations to provide the health care services. (NRS 422.273)
6 Sections 2 and 3 of this bill require each contract entered into by the Department
7 with a health maintenance organization to provide such services to include a
8 requirement for the health maintenance organization to reinvest a percentage of the
9 annual profits of the health maintenance organization in programs and initiatives to
10 address homelessness and to provide sustainable medication and prescription
11 services, alcohol or drug intervention or rehabilitation services and emergency and
-

– 2 –
12 supportive housing in the local communities in which the health maintenance
13 organization operates.
14 Existing law establishes a reinvestment advisory committee in each county of
15 this State whose population is 700,000 or more (currently only Clark County) and
16 prescribes the duties of a reinvestment advisory committee, which includes
17 reviewing, making recommendations and reporting to the Legislature and Director
18 of the Department concerning the reinvestment of funds by a health maintenance
19 organization that provides health care services through managed care to recipients
20 of Medicaid in the communities served by those organizations. (NRS 422.185,
21 422.205) Section 1 of this bill revises the duties of the reinvestment advisory
22 committee such that the recommendations and reports of the advisory committee
23 are required to concern the reinvestment of funds by managed care organizations to
24 address homelessness and to provide sustainable medication and prescription
25 services, alcohol or drug intervention or rehabilitation services, and emergency and
26 supportive housing, in conformance with the amendatory provisions of sections 2
27 and 3.
28 Existing federal law establishes a Continuum of Care Program to provide
29 funding for efforts by nonprofit providers, states, and local governments to quickly
30 rehouse homeless individuals and families. (42 U.S.C. 11381 et seq.; 24 C.F.R. Part
31 578) Federal law requires representatives from relevant organizations to establish a
32 Continuum of Care for a geographic area to carry out certain responsibilities and to
33 establish a board to act on behalf of the Continuum. (24 C.F.R. 578.5) Section 3.3
34 of this bill: (1) requires the Department to establish the Fiscal Advisory Committee
35 for a Flexible Continuum of Care Plan; (2) authorizes the Department to make
36 grants of money to the Advisory Committee to fund certain services; and (3)
37 requires the Advisory Committee to prepare an annual report. Section 3.3 requires
38 a city whose population is 150,000 or more but less than 500,000 to transmit an
39 amount of money which is not less than $1,000,000 but not more than $2,000,000
40 to the Department each fiscal year for allocation to the Advisory Committee to fund
41 programs to address homelessness in the service area of the Continuum of Care in
42 which the city is located. Section 3.3 requires the Department to assist the Advisory
43 Committee to enter into service agreements with federally-qualified health centers.
44 Sections 7.1-7.9 of this bill make appropriations to the Department for
45 allocation to the Advisory Committee to carry out the provisions of section 3.3.
