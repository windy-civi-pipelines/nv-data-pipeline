12 Section 1 grants a county in which the board of county commissioners has
13 established such an electronic database and the officers, employees and agents of
14 the county immunity from civil liability for any act or omission related to the

27 for any unauthorized acquisition of the information reported that may occur after a
28 report was made by the hospital or independent center for emergency medical care
29 in accordance with the requirements of section 3. Sections 4-9 of this bill make
30 conforming changes to provide for the administration and enforcement of the
31 requirements of section 3 in the same manner as other requirements imposed on

(ON BEHALF OF CLARK COUNTY)
PREFILED NOVEMBER 19, 2024
____________
Referred to Committee on Government Affairs
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to victims of a mass
casualty incident. (BDR 20-466)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public safety; authorizing a board of county
commissioners to establish an electronic database
containing information concerning victims of mass
casualty incidents; exempting certain persons from civil
liability related to such an electronic database, under
certain circumstances; providing for the confidentiality of
information contained in such an electronic database;
requiring a hospital and an independent center for
emergency medical care in a county in which such an
electronic database is established to report to the database
certain information concerning a victim of a mass

relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Section 1 of this bill authorizes a board of county commissioners to establish
2 and maintain an electronic database containing information concerning victims of
3 mass casualty incidents to coordinate the provision of reunification and
4 identification services and other appropriate follow-up services for such victims.
5 Section 1 sets forth certain requirements for such an electronic database and
6 requires a board of county commissioners that establishes such an electronic
7 database to determine certain matters concerning the information contained in the
8 database, the reporting of certain information to the database and the persons and

10 of this bill, the information contained in the electronic database is confidential and

12 Section 1 grants a county in which the board of county commissioners has
13 established such an electronic database and the officers, employees and agents of
14 the county immunity from civil liability for any act or omission related to the
15 establishment or maintenance of the database not amounting to willful misconduct,
16 gross negligence or bad faith.
17 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of medical facilities,
18 including hospitals and independent centers for emergency medical care, by the
19 Division of Public and Behavioral Health of the Department of Health and Human
20 Services. (Chapter 449 of NRS) Section 3 of this bill requires a hospital or

23 becomes aware of a mass casualty incident to report to the database certain
24 information about a victim of the mass casualty incident. Section 3 grants a
25 hospital, an independent center for emergency medical care and their agents and
26 employees immunity from civil liability for any such report made in good faith and
27 for any unauthorized acquisition of the information reported that may occur after a
28 report was made by the hospital or independent center for emergency medical care
29 in accordance with the requirements of section 3. Sections 4-9 of this bill make
30 conforming changes to provide for the administration and enforcement of the
31 requirements of section 3 in the same manner as other requirements imposed on
32 hospitals and independent centers for emergency medical care by existing law.
