EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public safety; authorizing a board of county
commissioners to establish an electronic database
containing information concerning victims of mass
casualty incidents; setting forth certain requirements for
such an electronic database; exempting certain persons
from civil liability related to such an electronic database,
under certain circumstances; providing for the
confidentiality of information contained in such an
electronic database; requiring a hospital and an
independent center for emergency medical care in a
county in which such an electronic database is established
to report to the database certain information concerning a
victim of a mass casualty incident; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Section 1 of this bill authorizes a board of county commissioners to establish
2 and maintain an electronic database containing information concerning victims of
3 mass casualty incidents to coordinate the provision of reunification and
4 identification services and long-term support services for such victims. Section 1
5 sets forth certain requirements for such an electronic database and requires a board
6 of county commissioners that establishes such an electronic database to determine
7 certain matters concerning the information contained in the database, the reporting
8 of certain information to the database and the persons and governmental entities
9 that may participate in the database. Under sections 1 and 2 of this bill, the
-
*AB50_R1*
– 2 –
10 information contained in the electronic database is confidential and may be
11 disclosed only by participants in the database for certain purposes. Additionally,
12 section 1 requires that, except for a victim of a mass casualty incident who has
13 provided written authorization for his or her information to remain in the database
14 for the purpose of receiving long-term support services, all information contained
15 in the database concerning a victim of a mass casualty incident must be deleted
16 after all victims of the mass casualty incident have been identified and reunified.
17 Section 1 grants a county in which the board of county commissioners has
18 established such an electronic database and the officers, employees and agents of
19 the county immunity from civil liability for any act or omission related to the
20 establishment or maintenance of the database not amounting to willful misconduct,
21 gross negligence or bad faith.
22 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of medical facilities,
23 including hospitals and independent centers for emergency medical care, by the
24 Division of Public and Behavioral Health of the Department of Health and Human
25 Services. (Chapter 449 of NRS) Section 3 of this bill requires a hospital or
26 independent center for emergency medical care located in a county in which an
27 electronic database is established pursuant to section 1 and which is notified or
28 becomes aware of a mass casualty incident to report to the database certain
29 information about a victim of the mass casualty incident. Section 3 additionally
30 requires a hospital or independent center for emergency medical care to: (1) inquire
31 whether such a victim wishes to receive long-term support services and, if so,
32 request that the victim provide written authorization for his or her information to
33 remain in the electronic database; and (2) include a unique identifier in the medical
34 record of such a victim. Section 3 grants a hospital, an independent center for
35 emergency medical care and their agents and employees immunity from civil
36 liability for any such report made in good faith and for any unauthorized acquisition
37 of the information reported that may occur after a report was made by the hospital
38 or independent center for emergency medical care in accordance with the
39 requirements of section 3. Sections 4-6 of this bill make conforming changes to
40 provide for the administration of the requirements of section 3 in the same manner
41 as other requirements imposed on hospitals and independent centers for emergency
42 medical care by existing law, except for the penalties imposed for violation of those
43 requirements. (NRS 449.029, 449.0301, 449.0302) Under section 3, a hospital or
44 independent center for emergency medical care that fails to comply with the
45 requirements of section 3 is not subject to any penalty for that failure. Sections 7-9
46 of this bill make conforming changes so that the penalties imposed for violations of
47 other requirements imposed on hospitals and independent centers for emergency
48 medical care by existing law do not apply to a failure to comply with the provisions
49 of section 3.

FIRST REPRINT A.B. 50
ASSEMBLY BILL NO. 50–COMMITTEE
ON GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS
(ON BEHALF OF CLARK COUNTY)
PREFILED NOVEMBER 19, 2024
____________
Referred to Committee on Government Affairs
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to victims of a mass
casualty incident. (BDR 20-466)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public safety; authorizing a board of county
commissioners to establish an electronic database
containing information concerning victims of mass
casualty incidents; setting forth certain requirements for
such an electronic database; exempting certain persons
from civil liability related to such an electronic database,
under certain circumstances; providing for the
confidentiality of information contained in such an
electronic database; requiring a hospital and an
independent center for emergency medical care in a
county in which such an electronic database is established
to report to the database certain information concerning a
victim of a mass casualty incident; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Section 1 of this bill authorizes a board of county commissioners to establish
2 and maintain an electronic database containing information concerning victims of
3 mass casualty incidents to coordinate the provision of reunification and
4 identification services and long-term support services for such victims. Section 1
5 sets forth certain requirements for such an electronic database and requires a board
6 of county commissioners that establishes such an electronic database to determine
7 certain matters concerning the information contained in the database, the reporting
8 of certain information to the database and the persons and governmental entities
9 that may participate in the database. Under sections 1 and 2 of this bill, the
-
*AB50_R1*

– 2 –
10 information contained in the electronic database is confidential and may be
11 disclosed only by participants in the database for certain purposes. Additionally,
12 section 1 requires that, except for a victim of a mass casualty incident who has
13 provided written authorization for his or her information to remain in the database
14 for the purpose of receiving long-term support services, all information contained
15 in the database concerning a victim of a mass casualty incident must be deleted
16 after all victims of the mass casualty incident have been identified and reunified.
17 Section 1 grants a county in which the board of county commissioners has
18 established such an electronic database and the officers, employees and agents of
19 the county immunity from civil liability for any act or omission related to the
20 establishment or maintenance of the database not amounting to willful misconduct,
21 gross negligence or bad faith.
22 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of medical facilities,
23 including hospitals and independent centers for emergency medical care, by the
24 Division of Public and Behavioral Health of the Department of Health and Human
25 Services. (Chapter 449 of NRS) Section 3 of this bill requires a hospital or
26 independent center for emergency medical care located in a county in which an
27 electronic database is established pursuant to section 1 and which is notified or
28 becomes aware of a mass casualty incident to report to the database certain
29 information about a victim of the mass casualty incident. Section 3 additionally
30 requires a hospital or independent center for emergency medical care to: (1) inquire
31 whether such a victim wishes to receive long-term support services and, if so,
32 request that the victim provide written authorization for his or her information to
33 remain in the electronic database; and (2) include a unique identifier in the medical
34 record of such a victim. Section 3 grants a hospital, an independent center for
35 emergency medical care and their agents and employees immunity from civil
36 liability for any such report made in good faith and for any unauthorized acquisition
37 of the information reported that may occur after a report was made by the hospital
38 or independent center for emergency medical care in accordance with the
39 requirements of section 3. Sections 4-6 of this bill make conforming changes to
40 provide for the administration of the requirements of section 3 in the same manner
41 as other requirements imposed on hospitals and independent centers for emergency
42 medical care by existing law, except for the penalties imposed for violation of those
43 requirements. (NRS 449.029, 449.0301, 449.0302) Under section 3, a hospital or
44 independent center for emergency medical care that fails to comply with the
45 requirements of section 3 is not subject to any penalty for that failure. Sections 7-9
46 of this bill make conforming changes so that the penalties imposed for violations of
47 other requirements imposed on hospitals and independent centers for emergency
48 medical care by existing law do not apply to a failure to comply with the provisions
49 of section 3.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 244 of NRS is hereby amended by adding
2 thereto a new section to read as follows:
3 1. A board of county commissioners may establish and

18 (d) The extent to which a person or governmental entity
19 described in paragraph (c) may participate in the electronic

23 database to which the person or governmental entity has access.
24 3. If a board of county commissioners establishes an
25 electronic database pursuant to subsection 1, the board of county

29 (a) Comply with all applicable provisions of 45 C.F.R. Parts
30 160, 162 and 164, NRS 603A.210 and any other applicable federal
31 and state law.
32 (b) Include, without limitation:
33 (1) The performance of vulnerability and risk assessments;
34 (2) The imposition of restrictions on access by a participant
35 to the information contained in the database based on the role of
36 the participant; and
37 (3) Reasonable measures for authentication, monitoring
38 and auditing to prevent unauthorized access to the information
39 contained in the database or misuse of that information.
40 4. Any information contained in an electronic database
41 established pursuant to subsection 1 is confidential and may only
42 be disclosed by a participant in the database as necessary for the
43 provision of reunification and identification services and long-
44 term support services for victims of mass casualty incidents.
45 Except for a victim of a mass casualty incident who has provided a
-

– 4 –
1 written authorization for his or her information to remain in the
2 electronic database for the purpose of receiving long-term support
3 services, all information contained in the database concerning a
4 victim of a mass casualty incident must be deleted after all victims
5 of the mass casualty incident have been identified and reunified.
6 5. An electronic database established pursuant to subsection
7 1 and the disclosure of information therefrom must comply with
8 the applicable provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and
9 Accountability Act of 1996, Public Law 104-191, as amended, and
10 the applicable regulations adopted pursuant thereto.
11 6. A county in which the board of county commissioners has
12 established an electronic database pursuant to subsection 1 and
13 any officer, employee or agent of the county are immune from
14 civil liability for any act or omission related to the establishment
15 or maintenance of the database not amounting to willful
16 misconduct, gross negligence or bad faith.
17 7. As used in this section:
18 (a) “Hospital” has the meaning ascribed to it in NRS 449.012.
19 (b) “Independent center for emergency medical care” has the
20 meaning ascribed to it in NRS 449.013.
