EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public safety; authorizing a board of county commissioners to
establish an electronic database containing information concerning
victims of mass casualty incidents; setting forth certain
requirements for such an electronic database; exempting certain
persons from civil liability related to such an electronic database, under
certain circumstances; providing for the confidentiality of information
contained in such an electronic database; requiring a hospital and an
independent center for emergency medical care in a county in which
such an electronic database is established to report to the database
certain information concerning a victim of a mass casualty incident;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Section 1 of this bill authorizes a board of county commissioners to establish and
2 maintain an electronic database containing information concerning victims of mass casualty
3 incidents to coordinate the provision of reunification and identification services and [other
4 appropriate follow-up] long-term support services for such victims. Section 1 sets forth
5 certain requirements for such an electronic database and requires a board of county
6 commissioners that establishes such an electronic database to determine certain matters
7 concerning the information contained in the database, the reporting of certain information to
8 the database and the persons and governmental entities that may participate in the database.
9 Under sections 1 and 2 of this bill, the information contained in the electronic database is
10 confidential and may be disclosed only by participants in the database for certain purposes.
11 Additionally, section 1 requires that, except for a victim of a mass casualty incident who
12 has provided written authorization for his or her information to remain in the database
13 for the purpose of receiving long-term support services, all information contained in the
14 database concerning a victim of a mass casualty incident must be deleted after all victims
15 of the mass casualty incident have been identified and reunified. Section 1 grants a county
16 in which the board of county commissioners has established such an electronic database and
17 the officers, employees and agents of the county immunity from civil liability for any act or
Assembly Amendment No. 193 to Assembly Bill No. 50 Page 4
18 omission related to the establishment or maintenance of the database not amounting to willful
19 misconduct, gross negligence or bad faith.
20 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of medical facilities, including
21 hospitals and independent centers for emergency medical care, by the Division of Public and
22 Behavioral Health of the Department of Health and Human Services. (Chapter 449 of NRS)
23 Section 3 of this bill requires a hospital or independent center for emergency medical care
24 located in a county in which an electronic database is established pursuant to section 1 and
25 which is notified or becomes aware of a mass casualty incident to report to the database
26 certain information about a victim of the mass casualty incident. Section 3 additionally
27 requires a hospital or independent center for emergency medical care to: (1) inquire
28 whether such a victim wishes to receive long-term support services and, if so, request
29 that the victim provide written authorization for his or her information to remain in the
30 electronic database; and (2) include a unique identifier in the medical record of such a
31 victim. Section 3 grants a hospital, an independent center for emergency medical care and
32 their agents and employees immunity from civil liability for any such report made in good
33 faith and for any unauthorized acquisition of the information reported that may occur after a
34 report was made by the hospital or independent center for emergency medical care in
35 accordance with the requirements of section 3. Sections [4-9] 4-6 of this bill make
36 conforming changes to provide for the administration [and enforcement] of the requirements
37 of section 3 in the same manner as other requirements imposed on hospitals and independent
38 centers for emergency medical care by existing law [.] , except for the penalties imposed for
39 violation of those requirements. (NRS 449.029, 449.0301, [449.0302, 449.160, 449.163,
40 449.240)] 449.0302) Under section 3, a hospital or independent center for emergency
41 medical care that fails to comply with the requirements of section 3 is not subject to any
42 penalty for that failure. Sections 7-9 of this bill make conforming changes so that the
43 penalties imposed for violations of other requirements imposed on hospitals and
44 independent centers for emergency medical care by existing law do not apply to a failure
45 to comply with the provisions of section 3.

Referred to Committee on Government Affairs
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to victims of a mass casualty incident.
(BDR 20-466)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public safety; authorizing a board of county commissioners to
establish an electronic database containing information concerning
victims of mass casualty incidents; setting forth certain
requirements for such an electronic database; exempting certain
persons from civil liability related to such an electronic database, under
certain circumstances; providing for the confidentiality of information
contained in such an electronic database; requiring a hospital and an
independent center for emergency medical care in a county in which
such an electronic database is established to report to the database
certain information concerning a victim of a mass casualty incident;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Section 1 of this bill authorizes a board of county commissioners to establish and
2 maintain an electronic database containing information concerning victims of mass casualty
3 incidents to coordinate the provision of reunification and identification services and [other
4 appropriate follow-up] long-term support services for such victims. Section 1 sets forth
5 certain requirements for such an electronic database and requires a board of county
6 commissioners that establishes such an electronic database to determine certain matters
7 concerning the information contained in the database, the reporting of certain information to
8 the database and the persons and governmental entities that may participate in the database.
9 Under sections 1 and 2 of this bill, the information contained in the electronic database is
10 confidential and may be disclosed only by participants in the database for certain purposes.
11 Additionally, section 1 requires that, except for a victim of a mass casualty incident who
12 has provided written authorization for his or her information to remain in the database
13 for the purpose of receiving long-term support services, all information contained in the
14 database concerning a victim of a mass casualty incident must be deleted after all victims
15 of the mass casualty incident have been identified and reunified. Section 1 grants a county
16 in which the board of county commissioners has established such an electronic database and
17 the officers, employees and agents of the county immunity from civil liability for any act or

Assembly Amendment No. 193 to Assembly Bill No. 50 Page 4
18 omission related to the establishment or maintenance of the database not amounting to willful
19 misconduct, gross negligence or bad faith.
20 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of medical facilities, including
21 hospitals and independent centers for emergency medical care, by the Division of Public and
22 Behavioral Health of the Department of Health and Human Services. (Chapter 449 of NRS)
23 Section 3 of this bill requires a hospital or independent center for emergency medical care
24 located in a county in which an electronic database is established pursuant to section 1 and
25 which is notified or becomes aware of a mass casualty incident to report to the database
26 certain information about a victim of the mass casualty incident. Section 3 additionally
27 requires a hospital or independent center for emergency medical care to: (1) inquire
28 whether such a victim wishes to receive long-term support services and, if so, request
29 that the victim provide written authorization for his or her information to remain in the
30 electronic database; and (2) include a unique identifier in the medical record of such a
31 victim. Section 3 grants a hospital, an independent center for emergency medical care and
32 their agents and employees immunity from civil liability for any such report made in good
33 faith and for any unauthorized acquisition of the information reported that may occur after a
34 report was made by the hospital or independent center for emergency medical care in
35 accordance with the requirements of section 3. Sections [4-9] 4-6 of this bill make
36 conforming changes to provide for the administration [and enforcement] of the requirements
37 of section 3 in the same manner as other requirements imposed on hospitals and independent
38 centers for emergency medical care by existing law [.] , except for the penalties imposed for
39 violation of those requirements. (NRS 449.029, 449.0301, [449.0302, 449.160, 449.163,
40 449.240)] 449.0302) Under section 3, a hospital or independent center for emergency
41 medical care that fails to comply with the requirements of section 3 is not subject to any
42 penalty for that failure. Sections 7-9 of this bill make conforming changes so that the
43 penalties imposed for violations of other requirements imposed on hospitals and
44 independent centers for emergency medical care by existing law do not apply to a failure
45 to comply with the provisions of section 3.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN

18 prevent unauthorized access to the information contained in the database or
19 misuse of that information.
20 4. Any information contained in an electronic database established
21 pursuant to subsection 1 is confidential and may only be disclosed by a
22 participant in the database as necessary for the provision of reunification and
23 identification services and [other appropriate follow-up] long-term support
24 services for victims of mass casualty incidents. Except for a victim of a mass
25 casualty incident who has provided a written authorization for his or her
26 information to remain in the electronic database for the purpose of receiving
27 long-term support services, all information contained in the database concerning
28 a victim of a mass casualty incident must be deleted after all victims of the mass
29 casualty incident have been identified and reunified.

19 Statutes of Nevada 2011 and section 2 of chapter 391, Statutes of Nevada 2013 and
20 unless otherwise declared by law to be confidential, all public books and public
21 records of a governmental entity must be open at all times during office hours to
22 inspection by any person, and may be fully copied or an abstract or memorandum
23 may be prepared from those public books and public records. Any such copies,

44 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
45 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
46 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by means of an
47 electronic medium would:
48 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
49 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential and that
50 cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from information that is not
51 otherwise confidential.

53 custody or control of a public record:

Assembly Amendment No. 193 to Assembly Bill No. 50 Page 8

3 prefer to provide the copy in a different medium.
4 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon request, prepare
5 the copy of the public record and shall not require the person who has requested the

14 care shall, as soon as possible but not later than [4] 24 hours after receiving and
15 registering a victim of the mass casualty incident as a patient at the hospital or
16 independent center for emergency medical care, report to the electronic database
17 the following information concerning the victim in accordance with 45 C.F.R. §

28 center for emergency medical care must report the information to the electronic
29 database, in the form and manner determined by the board of county
30 commissioners, as soon as reasonably possible, but in no event later than 12
31 hours after receiving and registering the victim as a patient at the hospital or
32 independent center for emergency medical care.] A hospital or an independent
33 center for emergency medical care shall:
34 (a) Include in the medical record of each patient who is the victim of a mass
35 casualty incident a unique identifier established by the hospital or independent
36 center for emergency medical care which allows the hospital or center to identify
37 the patient as a victim of a mass casualty incident in the event that the patient
38 wishes to receive long-term support services after discharge from the hospital or
39 center; and
40 (b) Before discharging a patient who is the victim of a mass casualty
41 incident, inquire whether the patient wishes to receive long-term support services
42 and, if so, request that the patient provide written authorization for his or her
43 information to remain in the electronic database established pursuant to section 1
44 of this act for the purpose of receiving such services.
45 3. A hospital, an independent center for emergency medical care and any
46 agent or employee thereof are immune from civil liability for any report made in
47 good faith in accordance with the requirements of this section and for any
48 unauthorized acquisition of any information reported that may occur after the
49 hospital or independent center for emergency medical care made a report in
50 accordance with the requirements of this section.
51 4. A hospital or independent center for emergency medical care that fails to
52 comply with the provisions of this section is not subject to any penalty imposed
53 pursuant to this chapter for such failure to comply.
