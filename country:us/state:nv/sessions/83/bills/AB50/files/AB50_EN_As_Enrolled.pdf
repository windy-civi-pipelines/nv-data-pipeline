Assembly Bill No. 50–Committee
on Government Affairs
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to public safety; authorizing a board of county
commissioners to establish an electronic database containing
information concerning victims of mass casualty incidents;
setting forth certain requirements for such an electronic
database; exempting certain persons from civil liability
related to such an electronic database, under certain
circumstances; providing for the confidentiality of
information contained in such an electronic database;
requiring a hospital and an independent center for emergency
medical care in a county in which such an electronic database
is established to report to the database certain information
concerning a victim of a mass casualty incident; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Section 1 of this bill authorizes a board of county commissioners to establish
and maintain an electronic database containing information concerning victims of
mass casualty incidents to coordinate the provision of reunification and
identification services and long-term support services for such victims. Section 1
sets forth certain requirements for such an electronic database and requires a board
of county commissioners that establishes such an electronic database to determine
certain matters concerning the information contained in the database, the reporting
of certain information to the database and the persons and governmental entities
that may participate in the database. Under sections 1 and 2 of this bill, the
information contained in the electronic database is confidential and may be
disclosed only by participants in the database for certain purposes. Additionally,
section 1 requires that, except for a victim of a mass casualty incident who has
provided written authorization for his or her information to remain in the database
for the purpose of receiving long-term support services, all information contained
in the database concerning a victim of a mass casualty incident must be deleted
after all victims of the mass casualty incident have been identified and reunified.
Section 1 grants a county in which the board of county commissioners has
established such an electronic database and the officers, employees and agents of
the county immunity from civil liability for any act or omission related to the
establishment or maintenance of the database not amounting to willful misconduct,
gross negligence or bad faith.
Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of medical facilities,
including hospitals and independent centers for emergency medical care, by the
Division of Public and Behavioral Health of the Department of Health and Human
Services. (Chapter 449 of NRS) Section 3 of this bill requires a hospital or
independent center for emergency medical care located in a county in which an
electronic database is established pursuant to section 1 and which is notified or
becomes aware of a mass casualty incident to report to the database certain
information about a victim of the mass casualty incident. Section 3 additionally
requires a hospital or independent center for emergency medical care to: (1) inquire
whether such a victim wishes to receive long-term support services and, if so,
-

– 2 –
request that the victim provide written authorization for his or her information to
remain in the electronic database; and (2) include a unique identifier in the medical
record of such a victim. Section 3 grants a hospital, an independent center for
emergency medical care and their agents and employees immunity from civil
liability for any such report made in good faith and for any unauthorized acquisition
of the information reported that may occur after a report was made by the hospital
or independent center for emergency medical care in accordance with the
requirements of section 3. Sections 4-6 of this bill make conforming changes to
provide for the administration of the requirements of section 3 in the same manner
as other requirements imposed on hospitals and independent centers for emergency
medical care by existing law, except for the penalties imposed for violation of those
requirements. (NRS 449.029, 449.0301, 449.0302) Under section 3, a hospital or
independent center for emergency medical care that fails to comply with the
requirements of section 3 is not subject to any penalty for that failure. Sections 7-9
of this bill make conforming changes so that the penalties imposed for violations of
other requirements imposed on hospitals and independent centers for emergency
medical care by existing law do not apply to a failure to comply with the provisions
of section 3.
