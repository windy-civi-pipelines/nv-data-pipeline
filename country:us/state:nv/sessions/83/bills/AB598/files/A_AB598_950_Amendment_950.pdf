Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth certain duties of the State Public Works Division of the
2 Department of Administration which include, without limitation, the oversight and
3 involvement of the Division in the planning, maintenance and construction of buildings upon
4 property of the State. (Chapter 341 of NRS) Existing law sets forth general provisions
5 applicable to public works, including provisions requiring, with certain exceptions, the
6 payment of prevailing wages for public works projects. (NRS 338.013-338.090) Additionally,
7 existing law establishes a program to provide matching funds to qualified projects that are
8 facilities to provide support services to individuals and families experiencing homelessness or
9 at risk of becoming homeless. (NRS 231.3711-231.3739) This bill exempts the development
10 of certain state land for a qualified project or cottages to provide services related to behavioral
11 health issues in children undertaken by the Campus for Hope Foundation, or its successor
12 organization, from: (1) certain provisions governing state buildings and the oversight or
13 involvement of the Division; and (2) certain provisions governing public works. This bill also
14 requires [, with certain exceptions,] a contractor or subcontractor who is awarded a contract
15 for the development of certain state land for a qualified project to comply with prevailing
16 wage requirements. [Finally, this bill exempts a contract for the development of state land for
17 certain cottages to provide services related to behavioral health issues in children from
18 prevailing wage requirements if the contractor has a project labor agreement.]
