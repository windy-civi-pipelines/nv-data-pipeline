benefits of certain federal programs; creating the Surplus

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:

4 Health and Human Services to administer that Program in this State. (NRS
5 422A.338) Section 2 of this bill requires, to the extent that money is available for
6 such purposes, the Division of Welfare and Supportive Services of the Department
7 to establish and carry out a program to supplement the supply of food available to
8 recipients of benefits provided under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance
9 Program using mechanisms designed to identify surplus food and distribute such
10 surplus food to recipients at a discount. Section 2 also requires the Division to
11 adopt a plan for the program that includes a system to: (1) reduce food waste using
12 technology to redirect surplus food to areas in which recipients are experiencing a
13 higher need for more affordable and healthier food; (2) reduce food insecurity for
14 recipients; and (3) increase access to food for recipients who are senior citizens.
15 Section 2 further requires the Division to take any action necessary to obtain

22 other contributions; (2) requires that any such money be deposited in the Account;
23 and (3) provides for the nonreversion of the money in the Account to the State
24 General Fund. Section 4 of this bill makes a conforming change as a result of the
