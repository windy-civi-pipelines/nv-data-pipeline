8 recipients of benefits provided under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance
9 Program using mechanisms designed to identify surplus food and distribute such

11 adopt a plan for the program that includes a system to: (1) reduce food waste using
12 technology to redirect surplus food to areas in which recipients are experiencing a
13 higher need for affordable and healthier food; (2) reduce food insecurity for
14 recipients; and (3) increase access to food for senior citizens.
