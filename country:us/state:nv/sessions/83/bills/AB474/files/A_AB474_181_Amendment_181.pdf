EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public welfare; requiring, to the extent that money is available,
the Division of Welfare and Supportive Services of the Department of
Health and Human Services to establish and carry out a program to
supplement the supply of food available to recipients of benefits of
certain federal programs; creating the Surplus Food Assistance
Account in the State General Fund; making an appropriation; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing federal law establishes the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which
2 provides assistance to certain low-income families for the purchase of food. (7 U.S.C. §§ 2011
3 et seq.) Existing state law requires the Department of Health and Human Services to
4 administer that Program in this State. (NRS 422A.338) Section 2 of this bill requires, to the
5 extent that money is available for such purposes, the Division of Welfare and Supportive
6 Services of the Department to establish and carry out a program to supplement the supply of
7 food available to recipients of benefits provided under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance
8 Program using mechanisms designed to identify surplus food and distribute such surplus food
9 to recipients at a discount. Section 2 also requires the Division to adopt a plan for the program
10 that includes a system to: (1) reduce food waste using technology to redirect surplus food to
11 areas in which recipients are experiencing a higher need for more affordable and healthier
12 food; (2) reduce food insecurity for recipients; and (3) increase access to food for recipients
13 who are senior citizens. Section 2 further requires the Division to take any action
14 necessary to obtain federal authorization to carry out the program, including, without
15 limitation, applying for any necessary federal waiver.
16 Section 3 of this bill creates the Surplus Food Assistance Account in the State General
17 Fund, to be administered by the Administrator of the Division and used only to carry out the
18 program established by section 2. Section 3 also: (1) authorizes the Administrator to apply for
19 and accept gifts, grants, bequests and other contributions; (2) requires that any such money be
20 deposited in the Account; and (3) provides for the nonreversion of the money in the Account
21 to the State General Fund. Section 4 of this bill makes a conforming change as a result of the
22 creation of this Account.
23 Section 5 of this bill makes an appropriation to the Surplus Food Assistance Account for
24 the program established by section 2.
