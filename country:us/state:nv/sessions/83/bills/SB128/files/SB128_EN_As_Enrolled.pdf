CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to health care; prescribing requirements governing
the denial of requests for prior authorization; making certain
legislative findings and declarations; encouraging licensed
physicians, physician assistants, advanced practice registered
nurses and osteopathic physicians to discuss with patients in
certain circumstances information relating to stem cell
treatment, storage and donation; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law authorizes certain health insurers to require an insured to obtain
prior authorization from the insurer before receiving certain care. (NRS 687B.225)
Sections 1, 4 and 5 of this bill prohibit certain health insurers, including insurance
for public employees, from solely using, employing or relying upon an artificial
intelligence system or an automated decision tool to: (1) deny a request for prior
authorization for medical or dental care; (2) modify a request for prior authorization
for such care submitted by a provider of health care; (3) reduce the scope of
services or amount of coverage for such care that is included within a request for
prior authorization; or (4) terminate, reduce or modify coverage for previously
approved medical or dental care. Sections 1, 4 and 5 also require such health
insurers to approve a request for prior authorization for medical or dental care that
is covered by the insurer, unless a licensed health care professional with the
education, training and expertise necessary to evaluate the condition at issue
determines that the care requested is not medically necessary or is experimental or
investigational. Sections 6 and 7 of this bill make conforming changes to clarify
that certain provisions generally applicable to members of plans of self-insurance
for employees of local governments and are applicable to the provisions of sections
4 and 5, respectively.
Existing law requires a physician, physician assistant, advanced practice
registered nurse or an osteopathic physician to counsel and provide certain
information to a patient who is diagnosed with certain conditions. (NRS 630.3737,
632.2383, 633.6947) Sections 9-11 of this bill make certain legislative findings and
declarations relating to the use of stem cell therapy, including a declaration
encouraging physicians, physician assistants, advanced practice registered nurses
and osteopathic physicians to: (1) discuss with a patient, upon diagnosing the
patient with arthritis, osteoarthritis or any other condition that is regularly treated
using stem cell therapy, the potential use of stem cell therapy to treat the condition;
and (2) when acting as providers of primary care during the first encounter with a
new patient, inform the patient of options that may be available to the patient for
donating, banking or storing stem cells for future use by the patient or a donee.
