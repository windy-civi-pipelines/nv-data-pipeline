3 Sections 1, 4, 5 and 8 of this bill prohibit certain health insurers, including

9 authorization; or (4) terminate, reduce or modify coverage for previously approved
10 care. Sections 1, 4, 5 and 8 also prohibit such health insurers from denying or
11 modifying a request for prior authorization on the grounds that the care requested is
12 not medically necessary or is experimental or investigational, unless a licensed
13 health care professional with the education, training and expertise necessary to
14 evaluate the condition at issue first makes such a determination. Section 2 of this
15 bill makes a conforming change to require the Director of the Department of Health
16 and Human Services to administer the requirements set forth in section 8 in the
17 same manner as other requirements governing Medicaid and the Children’s Health
18 Insurance Program. Sections 6 and 7 of this bill make conforming changes to

24 information to a patient who is diagnosed with certain conditions. (NRS 630.3737,

26 assistant, advanced practice registered nurse or an osteopathic physician to: (1)
27 discuss with a patient, upon diagnosing the patient with arthritis, osteoarthritis or
28 any other condition that is regularly treated using stem cell therapy, the potential
29 use of stem cell therapy to treat the condition; and (2) when acting as a provider of
30 primary care during the first encounter with a new patient, inform the patient of
