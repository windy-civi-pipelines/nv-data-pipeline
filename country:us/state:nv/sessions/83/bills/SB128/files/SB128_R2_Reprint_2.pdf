Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes certain health insurers to require an insured to obtain
2 prior authorization from the insurer before receiving certain care. (NRS 687B.225)
3 Sections 1, 4 and 5 of this bill prohibit certain health insurers, including insurance
4 for public employees, from solely using, employing or relying upon an artificial
5 intelligence system or an automated decision tool to: (1) deny a request for prior
6 authorization for medical or dental care; (2) modify a request for prior authorization
7 for such care submitted by a provider of health care; (3) reduce the scope of
8 services or amount of coverage for such care that is included within a request for
9 prior authorization; or (4) terminate, reduce or modify coverage for previously
10 approved medical or dental care. Sections 1, 4 and 5 also require such health
11 insurers to approve a request for prior authorization for medical or dental care that
12 is covered by the insurer, unless a licensed health care professional with the
13 education, training and expertise necessary to evaluate the condition at issue
14 determines that the care requested is not medically necessary or is experimental or
15 investigational. Sections 6 and 7 of this bill make conforming changes to clarify
16 that certain provisions generally applicable to members of plans of self-insurance
