6 authorization for medical or dental care; (2) modify a request for prior authorization
7 for such care submitted by a provider of health care; (3) reduce the scope of
8 services or amount of coverage for such care that is included within a request for
9 prior authorization; or (4) terminate, reduce or modify coverage for previously
10 approved medical or dental care. Sections 1, 4 and 5 also require such health
11 insurers to approve a request for prior authorization for medical or dental care that
12 is covered by the insurer, unless a licensed health care professional with the
13 education, training and expertise necessary to evaluate the condition at issue
14 determines that the care requested is not medically necessary or is experimental or
15 investigational. Sections 6 and 7 of this bill make conforming changes to clarify

FIRST REPRINT S.B. 128
SENATE BILL NO. 128–SENATOR NEAL
PREFILED JANUARY 29, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Commerce and Labor
SUMMARY—Makes changes related to health care. (BDR 57-87)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
CONTAINS UNFUNDED MANDATE (§ 4)
(NOT REQUESTED BY AFFECTED LOCAL GOVERNMENT)
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; prescribing requirements governing
the denial of requests for prior authorization; requiring, in
certain circumstances, licensed physicians, physician
assistants, advanced practice registered nurses and
osteopathic physicians to discuss with patients certain
information relating to stem cell treatment, storage and
donation; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes certain health insurers to require an insured to obtain
2 prior authorization from the insurer before receiving certain care. (NRS 687B.225)
3 Sections 1, 4 and 5 of this bill prohibit certain health insurers, including insurance
4 for public employees, from using, employing or relying upon an artificial
5 intelligence system or an automated decision tool to: (1) deny a request for prior
6 authorization for medical or dental care; (2) modify a request for prior authorization
7 for such care submitted by a provider of health care; (3) reduce the scope of
8 services or amount of coverage for such care that is included within a request for
9 prior authorization; or (4) terminate, reduce or modify coverage for previously
10 approved medical or dental care. Sections 1, 4 and 5 also require such health
11 insurers to approve a request for prior authorization for medical or dental care that
12 is covered by the insurer, unless a licensed health care professional with the
13 education, training and expertise necessary to evaluate the condition at issue
14 determines that the care requested is not medically necessary or is experimental or
15 investigational. Sections 6 and 7 of this bill make conforming changes to clarify
16 that certain provisions generally applicable to members of plans of self-insurance
17 for employees of local governments and are applicable to the provisions of sections
18 4 and 5, respectively.
