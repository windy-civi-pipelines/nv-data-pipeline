AN ACT relating to health care; prescribing requirements governing the denial of
requests for prior authorization; requiring, in certain circumstances,
licensed physicians, physician assistants, advanced practice registered
nurses and osteopathic physicians to discuss with patients certain
information relating to stem cell treatment, storage and donation; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes certain health insurers to require an insured to obtain prior
2 authorization from the insurer before receiving certain care. (NRS 687B.225) Sections 1, 4
3 and 5 of this bill prohibit certain health insurers, including insurance for public employees,
4 from solely using, employing or relying upon an artificial intelligence system or an automated
5 decision tool to: (1) deny a request for prior authorization for medical or dental care; (2)
6 modify a request for prior authorization for such care submitted by a provider of health care;
7 (3) reduce the scope of services or amount of coverage for such care that is included within a
8 request for prior authorization; or (4) terminate, reduce or modify coverage for previously
9 approved medical or dental care. Sections 1, 4 and 5 also require such health insurers to
10 approve a request for prior authorization for medical or dental care that is covered by the
11 insurer, unless a licensed health care professional with the education, training and expertise
12 necessary to evaluate the condition at issue determines that the care requested is not medically
13 necessary or is experimental or investigational. Sections 6 and 7 of this bill make conforming
14 changes to clarify that certain provisions generally applicable to members of plans of self-
15 insurance for employees of local governments and are applicable to the provisions of sections
16 4 and 5, respectively.
17 Existing law requires a physician, physician assistant, advanced practice registered nurse
18 or an osteopathic physician to counsel and provide certain information to a patient who is
19 diagnosed with certain conditions. (NRS 630.3737, 632.2383, 633.6947) Sections 9-11 of this
20 bill require a physician, physician assistant, advanced practice registered nurse or an
21 osteopathic physician to: (1) discuss with a patient, upon diagnosing the patient with arthritis,
22 osteoarthritis or any other condition that is regularly treated using stem cell therapy, the
23 potential use of stem cell therapy to treat the condition; and (2) when acting as a provider of
24 primary care during the first encounter with a new patient, inform the patient of options that

25 may be available to the patient for donating, banking or storing stem cells for future use by the
26 patient or a donee.

AN ACT relating to health care; prescribing requirements governing the denial of
requests for prior authorization; requiring, in certain circumstances,
licensed physicians, physician assistants, advanced practice registered
nurses and osteopathic physicians to discuss with patients certain
information relating to stem cell treatment, storage and donation; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes certain health insurers to require an insured to obtain prior
2 authorization from the insurer before receiving certain care. (NRS 687B.225) Sections 1, 4
3 and 5 of this bill prohibit certain health insurers, including insurance for public employees,
4 from solely using, employing or relying upon an artificial intelligence system or an automated
5 decision tool to: (1) deny a request for prior authorization for medical or dental care; (2)
6 modify a request for prior authorization for such care submitted by a provider of health care;
7 (3) reduce the scope of services or amount of coverage for such care that is included within a
8 request for prior authorization; or (4) terminate, reduce or modify coverage for previously
9 approved medical or dental care. Sections 1, 4 and 5 also require such health insurers to
10 approve a request for prior authorization for medical or dental care that is covered by the
11 insurer, unless a licensed health care professional with the education, training and expertise
12 necessary to evaluate the condition at issue determines that the care requested is not medically
13 necessary or is experimental or investigational. Sections 6 and 7 of this bill make conforming
14 changes to clarify that certain provisions generally applicable to members of plans of self-
15 insurance for employees of local governments and are applicable to the provisions of sections
16 4 and 5, respectively.
17 Existing law requires a physician, physician assistant, advanced practice registered nurse
18 or an osteopathic physician to counsel and provide certain information to a patient who is
19 diagnosed with certain conditions. (NRS 630.3737, 632.2383, 633.6947) Sections 9-11 of this
20 bill require a physician, physician assistant, advanced practice registered nurse or an
21 osteopathic physician to: (1) discuss with a patient, upon diagnosing the patient with arthritis,
22 osteoarthritis or any other condition that is regularly treated using stem cell therapy, the
23 potential use of stem cell therapy to treat the condition; and (2) when acting as a provider of
24 primary care during the first encounter with a new patient, inform the patient of options that
