SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to Medicaid fraud.
(BDR 18-446)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to Medicaid fraud; revising the authority of the
Attorney General, acting through the Medicaid Fraud
Control Unit, to issue subpoenas; setting forth procedures
for the enforcement of such a subpoena; revising
provisions governing certain actions for false or
fraudulent claims; revising the penalties for failing to
maintain certain records relating to Medicaid claims; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes the Medicaid Fraud Control Unit within the Office of
2 the Attorney General as the agency responsible for the investigation and
3 prosecution of violations or offenses relating to the State Plan for Medicaid. (NRS
4 228.410) In carrying out those duties and responsibilities, existing law authorizes
5 the Attorney General, acting through the chief executive of the Medicaid Fraud
6 Control Unit or his or her designee, to issue a subpoena for documents, records or
7 materials. (NRS 228.411) Section 1 of this bill additionally authorizes such a
8 subpoena to compel a person to: (1) appear and be examined under oath; and (2)
9 answer written interrogatories under oath. Section 1 sets forth procedures by which
10 the Attorney General may petition a court for the issuance of an order to compel
11 compliance with such a subpoena.
12 Existing federal law provides financial incentives for states that enact laws
13 establishing liability for false or fraudulent claims made to the State Plan for
14 Medicaid. (42 U.S.C. § 1396h) To be eligible for these financial incentives, the
15 laws of a state must contain provisions that are at least as effective at rewarding and
16 facilitating certain qui tam actions for false or fraudulent claims as those described
17 in the federal False Claims Act. (31 U.S.C. §§ 3729-3732) Existing federal law
-
*AB15*
– 2 –
18 prohibits a private person from bringing a qui tam action against a person for false
19 or fraudulent claims if the action is based upon allegations or transactions which are
20 the subject of a civil suit or an administrative civil money penalty proceeding in
21 which the Federal Government is already a party. (31 U.S.C. § 3730(e)(3)) Existing
22 state law contains similar provisions, but prohibits a private plaintiff from
23 maintaining, rather than bringing, a qui tam action for false or fraudulent claims if
24 the action is based upon allegations or transactions that are the subject of a civil
25 action or administrative proceeding for a monetary penalty to which the State or
26 political subdivision is already a party. (NRS 357.080) Section 2 of this bill revises
27 that prohibition, consistent with federal law, to prohibit a person from bringing,
28 rather than maintaining, such an action under those circumstances.
29 Existing law makes it a gross misdemeanor for a person to intentionally fail to
30 maintain certain records relating to a claim for payment for goods or services
31 pursuant to the State Plan for Medicaid. (NRS 422.570) Section 3 of this bill
32 instead makes the punishment for such an offense: (1) a misdemeanor if the amount
33 of the claim was less than $650; and (2) a gross misdemeanor if the amount of the
34 claim was $650 or more.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
