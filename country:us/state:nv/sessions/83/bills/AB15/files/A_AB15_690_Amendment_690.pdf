EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to Medicaid fraud; revising the authority of the Attorney General,
acting through the Medicaid Fraud Control Unit, to issue subpoenas;
setting forth procedures for the enforcement of such a subpoena;
revising provisions governing certain actions for false or fraudulent
claims; revising the penalties for failing to maintain certain records
relating to Medicaid claims; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes the Medicaid Fraud Control Unit within the Office of the
2 Attorney General as the agency responsible for the investigation and prosecution of violations
3 or offenses relating to the State Plan for Medicaid. (NRS 228.410) In carrying out those duties
4 and responsibilities, existing law authorizes the Attorney General, acting through the chief
5 executive of the Medicaid Fraud Control Unit or his or her designee, to issue a subpoena for
6 documents, records or materials. (NRS 228.411) Section 1 of this bill additionally authorizes
7 such a subpoena to compel a person to: (1) appear and be examined under oath; and (2)
8 answer written interrogatories under oath. Under section 1 the Attorney General is
9 authorized to use any documents, records, materials, testimony or answers produced
10 pursuant to such a subpoena in the course of a civil action involving Medicaid fraud, but
11 prohibited from using those items in the course of a criminal action. Section 1 sets forth
12 procedures by which the Attorney General may petition a court for the issuance of an order to
13 compel compliance with such a subpoena.
14 Existing federal law provides financial incentives for states that enact laws establishing
15 liability for false or fraudulent claims made to the State Plan for Medicaid. (42 U.S.C. §
16 1396h) To be eligible for these financial incentives, the laws of a state must contain provisions
17 that are at least as effective at rewarding and facilitating certain qui tam actions for false or
18 fraudulent claims as those described in the federal False Claims Act. (31 U.S.C. §§ 3729-
19 3732) Existing federal law prohibits a private person from bringing a qui tam action against a
20 person for false or fraudulent claims if the action is based upon allegations or transactions
21 which are the subject of a civil suit or an administrative civil money penalty proceeding in
22 which the Federal Government is already a party. (31 U.S.C. § 3730(e)(3)) Existing state law
23 contains similar provisions, but prohibits a private plaintiff from maintaining, rather than
24 bringing, a qui tam action for false or fraudulent claims if the action is based upon allegations

Senate Amendment No. 690 to Assembly Bill No. 15 Page 4
25 or transactions that are the subject of a civil action or administrative proceeding for a
26 monetary penalty to which the State or political subdivision is already a party. (NRS 357.080)
27 Section 2 of this bill revises that prohibition, consistent with federal law, to prohibit a person
28 from bringing, rather than maintaining, such an action under those circumstances.
29 Existing law makes it a gross misdemeanor for a person to intentionally fail to maintain
30 certain records relating to a claim for payment for goods or services pursuant to the State Plan
31 for Medicaid. (NRS 422.570) Section 3 of this bill instead makes the punishment for such an
32 offense: (1) a misdemeanor if the amount of the claim was less than $650; and (2) a gross
33 misdemeanor if the amount of the claim was $650 or more.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN

22 of the petition and hearing to the parties.

37 expense.
38 [4.] 6. A subpoena issued pursuant to this section must include a copy of the
39 provisions of subsections 1 [, 2 and 3.] to 5, inclusive.

13 dismissing the action or consenting to the dismissal, as applicable.
14 2. If a private plaintiff brings an action pursuant to this chapter, no person
