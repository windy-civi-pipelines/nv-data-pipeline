Section 1:
on Government Affairs
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to Medicaid fraud; revising the authority of the
Attorney General, acting through the Medicaid Fraud Control
Unit, to issue subpoenas; setting forth procedures for the
enforcement of such a subpoena; revising provisions
governing certain actions for false or fraudulent claims;
revising the penalties for failing to maintain certain records
relating to Medicaid claims; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law establishes the Medicaid Fraud Control Unit within the Office of
the Attorney General as the agency responsible for the investigation and
prosecution of violations or offenses relating to the State Plan for Medicaid. (NRS

Section 2:
228.410) In carrying out those duties and responsibilities, existing law authorizes
the Attorney General, acting through the chief executive of the Medicaid Fraud
Control Unit or his or her designee, to issue a subpoena for documents, records or
materials. (NRS 228.411) Section 1 of this bill additionally authorizes such a
subpoena to compel a person to: (1) appear and be examined under oath; and (2)
answer written interrogatories under oath. Under section 1 the Attorney General is
authorized to use any documents, records, materials, testimony or answers
produced pursuant to such a subpoena in the course of a civil action involving
Medicaid fraud, but prohibited from using those items in the course of a criminal
action. Section 1 sets forth procedures by which the Attorney General may petition
a court for the issuance of an order to compel compliance with such a subpoena.
Existing federal law provides financial incentives for states that enact laws
establishing liability for false or fraudulent claims made to the State Plan for
Medicaid. (42 U.S.C. § 1396h) To be eligible for these financial incentives, the
laws of a state must contain provisions that are at least as effective at rewarding and
facilitating certain qui tam actions for false or fraudulent claims as those described
in the federal False Claims Act. (31 U.S.C. §§ 3729-3732) Existing federal law
prohibits a private person from bringing a qui tam action against a person for false
or fraudulent claims if the action is based upon allegations or transactions which are
the subject of a civil suit or an administrative civil money penalty proceeding in
which the Federal Government is already a party. (31 U.S.C. § 3730(e)(3)) Existing
state law contains similar provisions, but prohibits a private plaintiff from
maintaining, rather than bringing, a qui tam action for false or fraudulent claims if
the action is based upon allegations or transactions that are the subject of a civil
action or administrative proceeding for a monetary penalty to which the State or
political subdivision is already a party. (NRS 357.080) Section 2 of this bill revises
that prohibition, consistent with federal law, to prohibit a person from bringing,
rather than maintaining, such an action under those circumstances.
Existing law makes it a gross misdemeanor for a person to intentionally fail to
maintain certain records relating to a claim for payment for goods or services
pursuant to the State Plan for Medicaid. (NRS 422.570) Section 3 of this bill
instead makes the punishment for such an offense: (1) a misdemeanor if the amount
of the claim was less than $650; and (2) a gross misdemeanor if the amount of the
claim was $650 or more.
