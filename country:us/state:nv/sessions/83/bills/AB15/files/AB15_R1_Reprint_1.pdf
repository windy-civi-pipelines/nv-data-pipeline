(BDR 18-446)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to Medicaid fraud; revising the authority of the
Attorney General, acting through the Medicaid Fraud
Control Unit, to issue subpoenas; setting forth procedures
for the enforcement of such a subpoena; revising
provisions governing certain actions for false or
fraudulent claims; revising the penalties for failing to
maintain certain records relating to Medicaid claims; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes the Medicaid Fraud Control Unit within the Office of
2 the Attorney General as the agency responsible for the investigation and
3 prosecution of violations or offenses relating to the State Plan for Medicaid. (NRS
4 228.410) In carrying out those duties and responsibilities, existing law authorizes
5 the Attorney General, acting through the chief executive of the Medicaid Fraud
6 Control Unit or his or her designee, to issue a subpoena for documents, records or
7 materials. (NRS 228.411) Section 1 of this bill additionally authorizes such a
8 subpoena to compel a person to: (1) appear and be examined under oath; and (2)
9 answer written interrogatories under oath. Under section 1 the Attorney General is
10 authorized to use any documents, records, materials, testimony or answers
11 produced pursuant to such a subpoena in the course of a civil action involving
12 Medicaid fraud, but prohibited from using those items in the course of a criminal
13 action. Section 1 sets forth procedures by which the Attorney General may petition
14 a court for the issuance of an order to compel compliance with such a subpoena.
15 Existing federal law provides financial incentives for states that enact laws
16 establishing liability for false or fraudulent claims made to the State Plan for
17 Medicaid. (42 U.S.C. § 1396h) To be eligible for these financial incentives, the
-

18 laws of a state must contain provisions that are at least as effective at rewarding and
19 facilitating certain qui tam actions for false or fraudulent claims as those described
20 in the federal False Claims Act. (31 U.S.C. §§ 3729-3732) Existing federal law
21 prohibits a private person from bringing a qui tam action against a person for false
22 or fraudulent claims if the action is based upon allegations or transactions which are
23 the subject of a civil suit or an administrative civil money penalty proceeding in
24 which the Federal Government is already a party. (31 U.S.C. § 3730(e)(3)) Existing
25 state law contains similar provisions, but prohibits a private plaintiff from
26 maintaining, rather than bringing, a qui tam action for false or fraudulent claims if
27 the action is based upon allegations or transactions that are the subject of a civil
28 action or administrative proceeding for a monetary penalty to which the State or
29 political subdivision is already a party. (NRS 357.080) Section 2 of this bill revises
30 that prohibition, consistent with federal law, to prohibit a person from bringing,
31 rather than maintaining, such an action under those circumstances.
32 Existing law makes it a gross misdemeanor for a person to intentionally fail to
33 maintain certain records relating to a claim for payment for goods or services
34 pursuant to the State Plan for Medicaid. (NRS 422.570) Section 3 of this bill
35 instead makes the punishment for such an offense: (1) a misdemeanor if the amount
36 of the claim was less than $650; and (2) a gross misdemeanor if the amount of the
37 claim was $650 or more.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
