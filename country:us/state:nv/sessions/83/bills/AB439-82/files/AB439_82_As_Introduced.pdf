AN ACT relating to insurance; providing, with certain exceptions,
that no provision for arbitration in a contract for health
insurance is binding upon any person insured under the
contract who makes a claim; repealing certain provisions
related to provisions for arbitration in a contract for health
insurance; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes the Nevada Insurance Code, which governs certain
2 contracts of insurance. (Title 57 of NRS) Existing law provides that no provision
3 for arbitration contained in an automobile liability or motor vehicle liability
4 insurance policy delivered, issued for delivery or renewed in this State is binding
5 upon the named insured or any other person who makes a claim under the policy.
6 (NRS 690B.017) Sections 4, 6, 7, 15, 16.5, 17, 18.5, 19 and 20 of this bill similarly
7 provide that no provision for arbitration is binding that is contained in any: (1)
8 policy of health insurance by an insurer; (2) policy of group or blanket health
9 insurance; (3) health benefit plan; (4) benefit contract; (5) contract for hospital,
10 medical or dental services; (6) evidence of coverage by a health maintenance
11 organization; (7) plan for dental care; (8) evidence of coverage by a prepaid limited
12 health service organization; or (9) evidence of coverage by a managed care
13 organization. Sections 4, 6, 7, 15, 16.5, 17, 18.5, 19 and 20 further provide that a
14 provision for arbitration included in any such contract of insurance must contain a
15 statement that the provision for arbitration is not binding. Section 16.5 further
16 provides that such provisions do not apply to a contract between: (1) a plan
17 sponsor; and (2) a hospital or a provider of health care. Sections 5 and 8 of this bill
18 make conforming changes to indicate the proper placement of sections 4 and 7 of
19 this bill, respectively, in the Nevada Revised Statutes.
