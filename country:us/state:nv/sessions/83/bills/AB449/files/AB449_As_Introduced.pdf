EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public utilities; revising provisions governing
certain procedures or methodologies for changing rates or
charges for certain public utilities; revising provisions
authorizing certain public utilities to submit letters of
advice for certain proposed changes in schedules of rates
or services in lieu of filing an application with the Public
Utilities Commission of Nevada; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada to adopt
2 regulations which provide simplified procedures or methodologies for a change of
3 rates for those public utilities which furnish water or services for the disposal of
4 sewage, or both, and which: (1) serve 3,000 or fewer persons; and (2) had during
5 the immediately preceding 12-month period gross sales for water or services for the
6 disposal of sewage amounting to $2,000,000 or less. Existing law also requires the
7 regulations adopted by the Commission to authorize public utilities that satisfy
8 those requirements to file letters of advice to change rates based on a nationally
9 recognized inflation index approved by the Commission. (NRS 704.095) Section 1
10 of this bill instead requires the regulations adopted by the Commission to provide
11 for simplified procedures or methodologies for a change of any rates or charges,
12 including, without limitation, rates for furnishing water or services for the disposal
13 of sewage, or both, connection fees, fees to expand capacity for the storage of water
14 and fees to expand capacity for plants for the treatment of wastewater or effluent
15 for public utilities which furnish water or services for the disposal of sewage, or
16 both, and which: (1) serve 4,000 or fewer persons; and (2) had during the
17 immediately preceding 12-month period gross sales for water or services for the
18 disposal of sewage amounting to $4,000,000 or less.
19 Existing law generally requires a public utility to submit an application and
20 obtain the approval of the Commission for a change in any schedule of rates or

21 services. (NRS 704.110) However, existing law authorizes a public utility to submit
22 a letter of advice in lieu of filing an application with the Commission if, among
23 other criteria, the proposed change does not change any rate or will result in an
24 increase in annual gross operating revenue in an amount that does not exceed
25 $15,000. Existing law additionally sets forth various requirements for the
26 submission of a letter of advice in lieu of an application by a small-scale provider
27 of last resort. (NRS 704.100) Section 2 of this bill authorizes a public utility other
28 than a small-scale provider of last resort to submit a letter of advice if the proposed
29 change does not change any rate or will result in an increase in annual gross
30 operating revenue in an amount that does not exceed $100,000. Section 2 maintains
31 the requirements for the use of a letter of advice by a small-scale provider of last
32 resort provided under existing law.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 704.095 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 704.095 1. The Commission shall adopt regulations which
3 provide simplified procedures or methodologies for a change of any
4 rates or charges for those public utilities which furnish water or
5 services for the disposal of sewage, or both, to persons within this
6 State for compensation, and which:
7 (a) Serve [3,000] 4,000 or fewer persons; and
8 (b) Had during the immediately preceding 12-month period
9 gross sales for water or services for the disposal of sewage
10 amounting to [$2,000,000] $4,000,000 or less. If a public utility
11 furnishes both water and services for the disposal of sewage, its
12 gross sales for each service must be considered separately for
13 determining whether the public utility qualifies under this paragraph
14 for either service.
15 2. The regulations adopted by the Commission pursuant to
16 subsection 1 must provide, without limitation, for the filing of letters
17 of advice to change [rates] :
18 (a) Rates for furnishing water or services for the disposal of
19 sewage, or both;
20 (b) Connection fees;
21 (c) Fees to expand capacity for the storage of water; and
22 (d) Fees to expand capacity for plants for the treatment of
23 wastewater or effluent,
24  based on a nationally recognized inflation index approved by the
25 Commission.
26 3. As used in this section, “connection fee” means the charge
27 for establishing service to a customer, defined in the tariff of the
28 utility as the installation or service connection fee.
