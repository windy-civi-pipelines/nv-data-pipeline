SUMMARY—Revises provisions governing public utilities. (BDR 58-888)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public utilities; revising provisions governing certain
procedures or methodologies for changing rates or [charges] fees for
certain public utilities; revising provisions authorizing certain public
utilities to submit letters of advice for certain proposed changes in
schedules of rates or services in lieu of filing an application with the
Public Utilities Commission of Nevada; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada to adopt regulations
2 which provide simplified procedures or methodologies for a change of rates for those public
3 utilities which furnish water or services for the disposal of sewage, or both, and which: (1)
4 serve 3,000 or fewer persons; and (2) had during the immediately preceding 12-month period
5 gross sales for water or services for the disposal of sewage amounting to $2,000,000 or less.
6 Existing law also requires the regulations adopted by the Commission to authorize public
7 utilities that satisfy those requirements to file letters of advice to change rates based on a
8 nationally recognized inflation index approved by the Commission. (NRS 704.095) Section 1
9 of this bill instead requires the regulations adopted by the Commission to provide for
10 simplified procedures or methodologies for a change of any rates or [charges, including,
11 without limitation, rates for furnishing water or services for the disposal of sewage, or both,
12 connection fees, fees to expand capacity for the storage of water and fees to expand capacity
13 for plants for the treatment of wastewater or effluent] for public utilities which furnish water
14 or services for the disposal of sewage, or both, and which: (1) serve 4,000 or fewer persons;
15 and (2) had during the immediately preceding 12-month period gross sales for water or
16 services for the disposal of sewage amounting to $4,000,000 or less. In addition to providing
17 for the filing of letters of advice to change rates based on an approved nationally
18 recognized inflation index, section 1 requires those regulations to provide for the filing of
19 letters of advice to change fees, as authorized by the Commission, based on such an
20 index.
21 Existing law generally requires a public utility to submit an application and obtain the
22 approval of the Commission for a change in any schedule of rates or services. (NRS 704.110)
23 However, existing law authorizes a public utility to submit a letter of advice in lieu of filing an
24 application with the Commission if, among other criteria, the proposed change does not
25 change any rate or will result in an increase in annual gross operating revenue in an amount
26 that does not exceed $15,000. Existing law additionally sets forth various requirements for the
27 submission of a letter of advice in lieu of an application by a small-scale provider of last
Assembly Amendment No. 209 to Assembly Bill No. 449 Page 4
28 resort. (NRS 704.100) Section 2 of this bill authorizes a public utility other than a small-scale
29 provider of last resort to submit a letter of advice if the proposed change does not change any
30 rate or will result in an increase in annual gross operating revenue in an amount that does not
31 exceed $100,000. Section 2 maintains the requirements for the use of a letter of advice by a
32 small-scale provider of last resort provided under existing law.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 704.095 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 704.095 1. The Commission shall adopt regulations which provide

6 (a) Serve [3,000] 4,000 or fewer persons; and
7 (b) Had during the immediately preceding 12-month period gross sales for
8 water or services for the disposal of sewage amounting to [$2,000,000] $4,000,000
9 or less. If a public utility furnishes both water and services for the disposal of
10 sewage, its gross sales for each service must be considered separately for
11 determining whether the public utility qualifies under this paragraph for either
12 service.
13 2. The regulations adopted by the Commission pursuant to subsection 1 must

25 Sec. 2. NRS 704.100 is hereby amended to read as follows:
26 704.100 1. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 704.075, 704.68861 to

34 (2) Files the proposed changes with the Commission using a letter of
35 advice in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (f) or (g).
36 (b) A public utility shall adjust its rates on a quarterly basis between annual

2 are currently in force.
3 (e) A public utility may not set forth as justification for a rate increase any
4 items of expense or rate base that previously have been considered and disallowed
5 by the Commission, unless those items are clearly identified in the application and
6 new facts or considerations of policy for each item are advanced in the application
7 to justify a reversal of the prior decision of the Commission.
8 (f) Except [as otherwise provided in paragraph (g),] for a public utility that is
9 a small-scale provider of last resort, if the proposed change in any schedule does
10 not change any rate or will result in an increase in annual gross operating revenue
11 in an amount that does not exceed [$15,000:] $100,000:
12 (1) The public utility may file the proposed change with the Commission

14 (2) The Commission shall determine whether it should dispense with a
15 hearing regarding the proposed change.
16  A letter of advice filed pursuant to this paragraph must include a certification by

19 belief, formed after a reasonable inquiry, the proposed change in schedule does not
20 change any rate or result in an increase in the annual gross operating revenue of the
21 public utility in an amount that exceeds [$15,000.] $100,000.
22 (g) If the applicant is a small-scale provider of last resort and the proposed
23 change in any schedule will result in an increase in annual gross operating revenue
24 in an amount that does not exceed $50,000 or 10 percent of the applicant’s annual
25 gross operating revenue, whichever is less:

40 advice not later than 5 years after the Commission has issued a final order on a
41 general rate application filed by the applicant in accordance with subsection 3 of
42 NRS 704.110; and
43 (2) The Commission shall determine whether it should dispense with a
44 hearing regarding the proposed change.
45  Not later than 10 business days after the filing of a letter of advice pursuant to
46 subparagraph (1), the Regulatory Operations Staff of the Commission or any other
47 interested party may file with the Commission a request that the Commission order
48 an applicant to file a general rate application in accordance with subsection 3 of
49 NRS 704.110. The Commission may hold a hearing to consider such a request.

6 Commission shall, not later than 90 days after receipt of such a request, issue an
