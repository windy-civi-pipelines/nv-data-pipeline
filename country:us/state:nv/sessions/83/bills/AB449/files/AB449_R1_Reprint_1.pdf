EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public utilities; revising provisions governing
certain procedures or methodologies for changing rates or
fees for certain public utilities; revising provisions
authorizing certain public utilities to submit letters of
advice for certain proposed changes in schedules of rates
or services in lieu of filing an application with the Public
Utilities Commission of Nevada; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada to adopt
2 regulations which provide simplified procedures or methodologies for a change of
3 rates for those public utilities which furnish water or services for the disposal of
4 sewage, or both, and which: (1) serve 3,000 or fewer persons; and (2) had during
5 the immediately preceding 12-month period gross sales for water or services for the
6 disposal of sewage amounting to $2,000,000 or less. Existing law also requires the
7 regulations adopted by the Commission to authorize public utilities that satisfy
8 those requirements to file letters of advice to change rates based on a nationally
9 recognized inflation index approved by the Commission. (NRS 704.095) Section 1
10 of this bill instead requires the regulations adopted by the Commission to provide
11 for simplified procedures or methodologies for a change of any rates or for public
12 utilities which furnish water or services for the disposal of sewage, or both, and
13 which: (1) serve 4,000 or fewer persons; and (2) had during the immediately
14 preceding 12-month period gross sales for water or services for the disposal of
15 sewage amounting to $4,000,000 or less. In addition to providing for the filing of
16 letters of advice to change rates based on an approved nationally recognized
17 inflation index, section 1 requires those regulations to provide for the filing of
18 letters of advice to change fees, as authorized by the Commission, based on such an
19 index.

20 Existing law generally requires a public utility to submit an application and
21 obtain the approval of the Commission for a change in any schedule of rates or
22 services. (NRS 704.110) However, existing law authorizes a public utility to submit
23 a letter of advice in lieu of filing an application with the Commission if, among
24 other criteria, the proposed change does not change any rate or will result in an
25 increase in annual gross operating revenue in an amount that does not exceed
26 $15,000. Existing law additionally sets forth various requirements for the
27 submission of a letter of advice in lieu of an application by a small-scale provider
28 of last resort. (NRS 704.100) Section 2 of this bill authorizes a public utility other
29 than a small-scale provider of last resort to submit a letter of advice if the proposed
30 change does not change any rate or will result in an increase in annual gross
31 operating revenue in an amount that does not exceed $100,000. Section 2 maintains
32 the requirements for the use of a letter of advice by a small-scale provider of last
33 resort provided under existing law.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 704.095 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 704.095 1. The Commission shall adopt regulations which
3 provide simplified procedures or methodologies for a change of any
4 rates or fees for those public utilities which furnish water or services
5 for the disposal of sewage, or both, to persons within this State for
6 compensation, and which:
7 (a) Serve [3,000] 4,000 or fewer persons; and
8 (b) Had during the immediately preceding 12-month period
9 gross sales for water or services for the disposal of sewage
10 amounting to [$2,000,000] $4,000,000 or less. If a public utility
11 furnishes both water and services for the disposal of sewage, its
12 gross sales for each service must be considered separately for
13 determining whether the public utility qualifies under this paragraph
14 for either service.
15 2. The regulations adopted by the Commission pursuant to
16 subsection 1 must provide, without limitation, for the filing of letters
17 of advice to change rates and, as authorized by the Commission,
18 fees, based on a nationally recognized inflation index approved by
19 the Commission.
20 Sec. 2. NRS 704.100 is hereby amended to read as follows:
21 704.100 1. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 704.075,

23 may otherwise be provided by the Commission pursuant to NRS
24 704.095, 704.097 or 704.7621:
25 (a) A public utility shall not make changes in any schedule,
26 unless the public utility:
27 (1) Files with the Commission an application to make the
28 proposed changes and the Commission approves the proposed
29 changes pursuant to NRS 704.110; or

*AB449_R1*

– 3 –
1 (2) Files the proposed changes with the Commission using a

3 or (g).
4 (b) A public utility shall adjust its rates on a quarterly basis

8 (c) An electric utility shall, between annual deferred energy
9 accounting adjustment applications filed pursuant to NRS 704.187,
10 adjust its rates on a quarterly basis pursuant to subsection 10 of
11 NRS 704.110.
12 (d) A public utility shall post copies of all proposed schedules
13 and all new or amended schedules in the same offices and in
14 substantially the same form, manner and places as required by NRS
15 704.070 for the posting of copies of schedules that are currently in
16 force.
17 (e) A public utility may not set forth as justification for a rate
18 increase any items of expense or rate base that previously have been
19 considered and disallowed by the Commission, unless those items
20 are clearly identified in the application and new facts or
21 considerations of policy for each item are advanced in the
22 application to justify a reversal of the prior decision of the
23 Commission.
24 (f) Except [as otherwise provided in paragraph (g),] for a public
25 utility that is a small-scale provider of last resort, if the proposed
26 change in any schedule does not change any rate or will result in an
27 increase in annual gross operating revenue in an amount that does
28 not exceed [$15,000:] $100,000:
29 (1) The public utility may file the proposed change with the
30 Commission using a letter of advice in lieu of filing an application;
31 and
32 (2) The Commission shall determine whether it should
33 dispense with a hearing regarding the proposed change.
34  A letter of advice filed pursuant to this paragraph must include a
35 certification by the attorney for the public utility or an affidavit by
36 an authorized representative of the public utility that to the best of
37 the signatory’s knowledge, information and belief, formed after a
38 reasonable inquiry, the proposed change in schedule does not
39 change any rate or result in an increase in the annual gross operating
40 revenue of the public utility in an amount that exceeds [$15,000.]
41 $100,000.
42 (g) If the applicant is a small-scale provider of last resort and the

19 issued a final order on a general rate application filed by the
20 applicant in accordance with subsection 3 of NRS 704.110; and
21 (2) The Commission shall determine whether it should
22 dispense with a hearing regarding the proposed change.

26 the Commission a request that the Commission order an applicant to
27 file a general rate application in accordance with subsection 3 of
28 NRS 704.110. The Commission may hold a hearing to consider such
29 a request.
30 (h) In making the determination pursuant to paragraph (f) or (g),
31 the Commission shall first consider all timely written protests, any
32 presentation that the Regulatory Operations Staff of the Commission

34 other matters deemed relevant by the Commission.
35 2. An applicant that is a small-scale provider of last resort may
