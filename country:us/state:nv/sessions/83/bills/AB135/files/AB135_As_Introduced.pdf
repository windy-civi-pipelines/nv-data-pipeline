Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to taxation; extending certain partial tax
exemptions for veterans to surviving spouses who satisfy
certain criteria; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law exempts from property taxes $1,000 of the assessed valuation of
2 property, adjusted each fiscal year using the Consumer Price Index, in which a
3 surviving spouse who is a resident of this State has an interest. (NRS 361.080)
4 Existing law also exempts from property taxes $2,000 of the assessed valuation of
5 property, as adjusted each fiscal year using the Consumer Price Index, in which a
6 veteran who served on active duty under certain circumstances has an interest.
7 (NRS 361.090) Section 1 of this bill expands this exemption so that a person who
8 is a resident of this State and is the surviving spouse of such a veteran is entitled to
9 the veteran’s exemption from property taxes. Under section 1, the surviving spouse
10 of a veteran who receives the veteran’s exemption from property taxes would not
11 be entitled to an additional exemption under existing law for surviving spouses.
12 Existing law provides a partial exemption from property taxes for a veteran
13 with a permanent service-connected disability, or the surviving spouse of such a
14 veteran, and prohibits a person who claims this partial exemption as a disabled
15 veteran from obtaining the other property tax exemption otherwise allowable for a
16 veteran. Existing law, however, provides that a person who qualifies as both a
17 veteran and also the surviving spouse of a veteran with a permanent service-
18 connected disability may claim both of the veterans’ exemptions from property
19 taxes. (NRS 361.091) Section 2 of this bill: (1) maintains the authorization of a
20 person who qualifies as a veteran and also as the surviving spouse of a veteran with
21 a permanent service-connected disability to claim both the exemption for veterans
22 and the exemption for surviving spouses of veterans with a permanent service-
23 connected disability; and (2) provides that a person who is the surviving spouse of a
-

– 2 –
24 veteran with a service-connected disability, but who does not qualify as a veteran,
25 is not entitled to an additional exemption as the surviving spouse of a veteran
26 pursuant to section 1 if the person claims the exemption for surviving spouses of
27 veterans with a permanent service-connected disability.
28 Existing law provides an exemption from the governmental services taxes
29 otherwise due on the vehicle of a surviving spouse, to the extent of $1,000 of the
30 determined valuation, as adjusted each fiscal year using the Consumer Price Index.
31 (NRS 371.101) Under existing law, a veteran who served on active duty under
32 certain circumstances is entitled to an exemption from the governmental services
33 taxes otherwise due on a vehicle of the veteran, to the extent of $2,000 of the
34 determined valuation, as adjusted each fiscal year using the Consumer Price Index.
35 (NRS 371.103) Section 4 of this bill expands this exemption so that a person who
36 is a resident of this State and is the surviving spouse of such a veteran is entitled to
37 the veteran’s exemption. Under section 4, the surviving spouse of a veteran who
38 receives the veteran’s exemption from the governmental services taxes would not
39 be entitled to an additional exemption under existing law for surviving spouses.
40 Existing law provides a partial exemption from governmental services taxes for
41 a veteran with a permanent service-connected disability, or the surviving spouse of
42 such a veteran, and prohibits a person who claims this partial exemption as a
43 disabled veteran from obtaining the other exemption from governmental services
44 taxes otherwise allowable for a veteran. Existing law, however, provides that a
45 person who qualifies as both a veteran and the surviving spouse of a veteran with a
46 permanent service-connected disability may claim both of the veterans’ exemptions
47 from governmental services taxes. (NRS 371.104) Section 5 of this bill: (1)
48 maintains the authorization of a person who is a veteran and also the surviving
49 spouse of a veteran with a permanent service-connected disability to claim both the
50 exemption for veterans and the exemption for surviving spouses of veterans with a
51 permanent service-connected disability; and (2) provides that a person who is the
52 surviving spouse of a veteran with a service-connected disability, but who does not
53 qualify as a veteran, is not entitled to an additional exemption as the surviving
54 spouse of a veteran pursuant to section 4 if the person claims the exemption for
55 surviving spouses of veterans with a permanent service-connected disability.
56 Under existing law, the partial exemption from property taxes to which a
57 surviving spouse or veteran is entitled is reduced to the extent of any partial
58 exemption from governmental services taxes allowed for the surviving spouse or
59 veteran. (NRS 361.1565) Section 3 of this bill provides that any exemption from
60 property taxes to which a surviving spouse of a veteran is entitled pursuant to
61 section 1 will be reduced to the extent of any partial exemption from governmental
62 services taxes allowed to the surviving spouse pursuant to section 4.

3 Sec. 5. NRS 371.104 is hereby amended to read as follows:
4 371.104 1. A bona fide resident of the State of Nevada who
5 has incurred a permanent service-connected disability and has been
6 honorably discharged from the Armed Forces of the United States,
7 or his or her surviving spouse, is entitled to a veteran’s exemption
8 from the payment of governmental services taxes on vehicles of the
9 following determined valuations:
10 (a) If he or she has a disability of 100 percent, the first $20,000
11 of determined valuation.

14 (c) If he or she has a disability of 60 to 79 percent, inclusive, the
15 first $10,000 of determined valuation.
16 2. In lieu of claiming the exemption from taxation set forth in
17 subsection 1 in his or her name, a veteran may transfer the
18 exemption to his or her current spouse. To transfer the exemption,
19 the veteran must file an affidavit of transfer with the Department in
20 the county where the exemption would otherwise have been
21 claimed. The affidavit of transfer must be made before an authorized

23 such a transfer:
24 (a) The spouse of the veteran is entitled to the exemption in the
25 same manner as if the spouse were the veteran;

28 (c) The transfer expires upon the earlier of:
29 (1) The termination of the marriage;
30 (2) The death of the veteran; or
31 (3) The revocation of the transfer by the veteran as described
32 in paragraph (d); and
33 (d) The veteran may, at any time, revoke the transfer of the
34 exemption by filing with the Department in the county where the
35 exemption is claimed an affidavit made before an authorized
36 employee of the Department or a notary public.
37 3. For the purpose of this section, the first $20,000 of
38 determined valuation of vehicles in which a person described in
39 subsection 1 or 2 has any interest shall be deemed to belong entirely
40 to that person.
41 4. A person claiming the exemption shall file annually with the
42 Department in the county where the exemption is claimed an
43 affidavit declaring that he or she is a bona fide resident of the State
44 of Nevada who meets all the other requirements of subsection 1 or

2 exemption and after the transfer of the exemption, if any, pursuant
3 to subsection 2, the county assessor shall, except as otherwise
4 provided in this subsection, mail a form for:
5 (a) The renewal of the exemption; and

8 Account for the Veterans Home in Northern Nevada established
9 pursuant to NRS 417.145,

11 year in which the exemption was allowed for that person. The form
12 must be designed to facilitate its return by mail by the person
13 claiming the exemption. If so requested by the person claiming the
14 exemption, the county assessor may provide the form to the person
15 by electronic means in lieu of by mail.
16 5. Before allowing any exemption pursuant to the provisions of
17 this section, the Department shall require proof of the veteran’s
18 status, and for that purpose shall require production of:
19 (a) A certificate from the Department of Veterans Affairs that
20 the veteran has incurred a permanent service-connected disability,
21 which shows the percentage of that disability; and
22 (b) Any one of the following:
23 (1) An honorable discharge;
24 (2) A certificate of satisfactory service; or
25 (3) A certified copy of either of these documents.
26 6. A surviving spouse claiming an exemption pursuant to this
27 section must file with the Department in the county where the
28 exemption is claimed an affidavit declaring that:
29 (a) The surviving spouse was married to and living with the
30 veteran with a disability for the 5 years preceding his or her death;
31 (b) The veteran with a disability was eligible for the exemption
32 at the time of his or her death or, if not for a transfer of the
33 exemption pursuant to subsection 2, would have been eligible for
34 the exemption at the time of his or her death; and
35 (c) The surviving spouse has not remarried.
36  The affidavit required by this subsection is in addition to the
37 certification required pursuant to subsections 4 and 5. After the
38 filing of the original affidavit required by this subsection, the county
39 assessor shall, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, mail
40 a form for renewal of the exemption to the person each year
41 following a year in which the exemption was allowed for that
42 person. The form must be designed to facilitate its return by mail by
43 the person claiming the exemption. If so requested by the person

1 7. If a tax exemption is allowed under this section to a person
2 who qualifies for the tax exemption:
3 (a) As a veteran or as the current spouse of a veteran who
4 receives a transfer of an exemption pursuant to subsection 2, that
5 person is not entitled to an exemption under NRS 371.103.
6 (b) Solely as the surviving spouse of a veteran with a permanent
7 service-connected disability, the allowance of a tax exemption under
8 this section does not affect the eligibility of that person for an
9 exemption as a veteran under NRS 371.103.
10 8. If any person makes a false affidavit or produces false proof
11 to the Department, and as a result of the false affidavit or false proof
12 the person is allowed a tax exemption to which he or she is not
13 entitled, the person is guilty of a gross misdemeanor.
14 9. Beginning with the 2005-2006 Fiscal Year, the monetary
15 amounts in subsections 1 and 3 must be adjusted for each fiscal year
16 by adding to each amount the product of the amount multiplied by
17 the percentage increase in the consumer price inflation index from
18 July 2003 to the July preceding the fiscal year for which the
19 adjustment is calculated.
20 10. For the purposes of this section, “consumer price inflation
21 index” means the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers,
22 West Region (All Items), as published by the United States
23 Department of Labor or, if that index ceases to be published by the
24 United States Department of Labor, the published index selected by
25 the Department of Taxation pursuant to subsection 11 of
26 NRS 361.091.
