Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes provisions governing the operation of railroads in this State.
2 (Chapter 705 of NRS) Section 2 of this bill prohibits a Class I or Class II railroad [company
3 owning or] operating [any railroad] in this State from [: (1)] operating, running or allowing to
4 be run on certain railroad tracks a freight or work train that is more than [8,500] 7,500 feet
5 long . [; and (2) placing a stationary rail car or train within 1,500 feet of a railroad grade
6 crossing.] Section 2 also requires a Class I or Class II railroad [company owning or]
7 operating [any railroad] in this State to: (1) install and periodically inspect a hot box detector
8 every [10] 20 miles along certain railroad tracks in this State; and (2) cut, separate or move a
9 train, rolling stock or other on-track equipment that has come to a complete stop and is
10 blocking a railroad grade crossing, if an authorized emergency vehicle is approaching the
11 crossing, with certain exceptions. Section 3 of this bill prohibits a Class I or Class II railroad
12 [company owning or] operating [any railroad] in this State from placing or causing to be
13 placed certain material, debris and other objects that could pose a safety hazard to employees
14 of the railroad within a certain area surrounding railroad tracks.
15 Section 4 of this bill requires [certain] Class I or Class II railroads that operate a railroad
16 yard where rail cars or locomotives are frequently switched, repaired or inspected at night or
Assembly Amendment No. 320 to Assembly Bill No. 446 Page 4
17 where trains are frequently assembled or disassembled at night to: (1) maintain the lighting
18 equipment installed in such railroad yards in good and working order; and (2) [promptly]
19 repair or replace malfunctioning lighting equipment within 48 hours after receiving a report of
20 a malfunction of the equipment. Section 4 establishes certain minimum standards for lighting
21 equipment installed in a railroad yard where rail cars or locomotives carrying hazardous
22 materials are frequently switched, repaired or inspected at night or where certain trains
23 carrying such materials are frequently assembled or disassembled at night. Section 4
24 additionally requires [certain] Class I or Class II railroads and the union representatives of
25 the employees of each railroad yard of such railroads to annually compile and transmit to the
26 Public Utilities Commission of Nevada certain reports relating to the maintenance and
27 operation of the lighting equipment installed in the railroad yards operated by the railroad.
28 Section 5 of this bill requires a railroad company owning or operating any railroad in this
29 State to authorize a representative of a union that represents the employees of the railroad to
30 monitor the safety practices of the railroad. Section 5 requires a railroad to authorize the
31 representative of such a union to access the property of the railroad to conduct certain
32 inspections and other activities to monitor the safety practices of the railroad. Section 5 also
33 requires a railroad to notify the Commission and certain union officials upon the occurrence of
34 any derailment, collision or other incident involving a train, rail car, locomotive or other
35 equipment owned or operated by the railroad or operated on the railroad tracks owned or
36 operated by the railroad.
37 Section 6 of this bill requires each Class I or Class II railroad [company owning or]
38 operating [any railroad] in this State to provide a bond to the Commission in an amount of not
39 less than $5,000,000 to ensure the compliance of the railroad with the provisions of sections
40 2-5. Section 6 also provides that a railroad that violates the provisions of sections 2-5 is
41 subject to certain civil penalties. Sections 1.5 and 1.7 of this bill define the terms “Class I
42 railroad” and “Class II railroad,” respectively, and section 1.3 of this bill establishes the
43 applicability of those definitions to sections 1.3-6.
44 Existing law requires an operator of a motor vehicle that transports passengers for
45 compensation pursuant to a contract with one or more customers to obtain a permit from the
46 Nevada Transportation Authority as a contract motor carrier. Existing law subjects each
47 contract motor carrier to certain regulations and requirements. (Chapter 706 of NRS) Sections
48 9-20 of this bill prescribe additional requirements for railroad contract carriers, which are
49 contract motor carriers that specifically transport, for compensation and within this State,
50 employees of a railroad. Section 15 limits, with certain exceptions, the number of hours that a
51 railroad contract carrier can require or allow a driver employed by the carrier to drive or
52 otherwise be on duty for the carrier. Section 15 requires a railroad contract carrier to [ensure]
53 require that each driver maintains accurate time records on a daily basis. Section 15 requires
54 each railroad contract carrier to collect and retain records for each driver for a period of not
55 less than 1 year. Section 16 prohibits a railroad contract carrier from employing a driver who
56 has twice been convicted of certain traffic offenses within a 3-year period or has ever had his
57 or her driving privileges suspended or revoked due to a conviction of certain traffic offenses.
58 Section 16 also requires a railroad contract carrier to maintain for each driver employed by
59 the carrier certain information relating to the driving ability and safety record of the driver.
60 Section 17 prohibits a person from acting as a driver for a railroad contract carrier unless the
61 person submits to testing for alcohol and controlled substances. Section 17 also requires a
62 railroad contract carrier to test a driver involved in a crash involving certain injuries for
63 alcohol and controlled substances as soon as practicable after the crash. Section 17 requires a
64 railroad contract carrier to transmit the results of any post-crash testing of a driver to the
65 Authority. Section 18 requires a railroad contract carrier to annually inspect each transport
66 vehicle operated by the carrier. Section 18 further requires a railroad contract carrier to
67 [develop] adopt a vehicle safety and maintenance policy, which must provide for the weekly
68 inspection of parts and accessories of each transport vehicle. Section 18 requires each
69 transport vehicle operated by a railroad contract carrier to be equipped with certain equipment
70 and safety features.
71 Existing law requires motor carriers regulated by the Authority to maintain a liability
72 insurance policy in such amounts as the Authority may designate. (NRS 706.291) Section 19
73 instead requires each railroad contract carrier to maintain a certain minimum amount of
74 liability coverage and uninsured and underinsured vehicle coverage. Section 25 of this bill
75 clarifies that the insurance requirements of section 19 apply only to railroad contract carriers
Assembly Amendment No. 320 to Assembly Bill No. 446 Page 5
76 and not to other contract motor carriers, which are still required to maintain the minimum
77 amount of coverage prescribed by the Authority. Additionally, section 20 requires a railroad
78 contract carrier to provide a bond to the Authority in an amount of not less than $5,000,000 to
79 ensure the compliance of the railroad contract carrier with the provisions of sections 8-20.
80 Existing law declares all contract motor carriers to be affected with a public interest and
81 subject to the permitting, regulatory and enforcement authority of the Authority. (NRS
82 706.156) Section 22 of this bill requires a railroad contract carrier to comply with the
83 provisions of sections 8-20 in the same manner as the carrier is required to comply with other
84 requirements and regulations applicable to contract motor carriers generally. Sections 26-30
85 of this bill provide for the enforcement of sections 8-20 by the Authority in the same manner
86 as other provisions relating to motor carriers. Section 23 of this bill clarifies that the
87 requirements of sections 8-20 are inapplicable to vehicles leased to or owned by certain
88 governmental entities. Section 24 of this bill requires a railroad contract carrier to display
89 certain identifying information on each vehicle it operates. Sections 9-14 define certain terms
90 relating to railroad contract carriers and section 8 establishes the applicability of those
91 definitions. Section 21 of this bill applies definitions in existing law relating to the regulation
92 of motor carriers to sections 8-20.

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes provisions governing the operation of railroads in this State.
2 (Chapter 705 of NRS) Section 2 of this bill prohibits a Class I or Class II railroad [company
3 owning or] operating [any railroad] in this State from [: (1)] operating, running or allowing to
4 be run on certain railroad tracks a freight or work train that is more than [8,500] 7,500 feet
5 long . [; and (2) placing a stationary rail car or train within 1,500 feet of a railroad grade
6 crossing.] Section 2 also requires a Class I or Class II railroad [company owning or]
7 operating [any railroad] in this State to: (1) install and periodically inspect a hot box detector
8 every [10] 20 miles along certain railroad tracks in this State; and (2) cut, separate or move a
9 train, rolling stock or other on-track equipment that has come to a complete stop and is
10 blocking a railroad grade crossing, if an authorized emergency vehicle is approaching the
11 crossing, with certain exceptions. Section 3 of this bill prohibits a Class I or Class II railroad
12 [company owning or] operating [any railroad] in this State from placing or causing to be
13 placed certain material, debris and other objects that could pose a safety hazard to employees
14 of the railroad within a certain area surrounding railroad tracks.
15 Section 4 of this bill requires [certain] Class I or Class II railroads that operate a railroad
16 yard where rail cars or locomotives are frequently switched, repaired or inspected at night or

Assembly Amendment No. 320 to Assembly Bill No. 446 Page 4
17 where trains are frequently assembled or disassembled at night to: (1) maintain the lighting
18 equipment installed in such railroad yards in good and working order; and (2) [promptly]
19 repair or replace malfunctioning lighting equipment within 48 hours after receiving a report of
20 a malfunction of the equipment. Section 4 establishes certain minimum standards for lighting
21 equipment installed in a railroad yard where rail cars or locomotives carrying hazardous
22 materials are frequently switched, repaired or inspected at night or where certain trains
23 carrying such materials are frequently assembled or disassembled at night. Section 4
24 additionally requires [certain] Class I or Class II railroads and the union representatives of
25 the employees of each railroad yard of such railroads to annually compile and transmit to the
26 Public Utilities Commission of Nevada certain reports relating to the maintenance and
27 operation of the lighting equipment installed in the railroad yards operated by the railroad.
28 Section 5 of this bill requires a railroad company owning or operating any railroad in this
29 State to authorize a representative of a union that represents the employees of the railroad to
30 monitor the safety practices of the railroad. Section 5 requires a railroad to authorize the
31 representative of such a union to access the property of the railroad to conduct certain
32 inspections and other activities to monitor the safety practices of the railroad. Section 5 also
33 requires a railroad to notify the Commission and certain union officials upon the occurrence of
34 any derailment, collision or other incident involving a train, rail car, locomotive or other
35 equipment owned or operated by the railroad or operated on the railroad tracks owned or
36 operated by the railroad.
37 Section 6 of this bill requires each Class I or Class II railroad [company owning or]
38 operating [any railroad] in this State to provide a bond to the Commission in an amount of not
39 less than $5,000,000 to ensure the compliance of the railroad with the provisions of sections
40 2-5. Section 6 also provides that a railroad that violates the provisions of sections 2-5 is
41 subject to certain civil penalties. Sections 1.5 and 1.7 of this bill define the terms “Class I
42 railroad” and “Class II railroad,” respectively, and section 1.3 of this bill establishes the
43 applicability of those definitions to sections 1.3-6.
44 Existing law requires an operator of a motor vehicle that transports passengers for
45 compensation pursuant to a contract with one or more customers to obtain a permit from the
46 Nevada Transportation Authority as a contract motor carrier. Existing law subjects each
47 contract motor carrier to certain regulations and requirements. (Chapter 706 of NRS) Sections
48 9-20 of this bill prescribe additional requirements for railroad contract carriers, which are
49 contract motor carriers that specifically transport, for compensation and within this State,
50 employees of a railroad. Section 15 limits, with certain exceptions, the number of hours that a
51 railroad contract carrier can require or allow a driver employed by the carrier to drive or
52 otherwise be on duty for the carrier. Section 15 requires a railroad contract carrier to [ensure]
53 require that each driver maintains accurate time records on a daily basis. Section 15 requires
54 each railroad contract carrier to collect and retain records for each driver for a period of not
55 less than 1 year. Section 16 prohibits a railroad contract carrier from employing a driver who
56 has twice been convicted of certain traffic offenses within a 3-year period or has ever had his
57 or her driving privileges suspended or revoked due to a conviction of certain traffic offenses.
58 Section 16 also requires a railroad contract carrier to maintain for each driver employed by
59 the carrier certain information relating to the driving ability and safety record of the driver.
60 Section 17 prohibits a person from acting as a driver for a railroad contract carrier unless the
61 person submits to testing for alcohol and controlled substances. Section 17 also requires a
62 railroad contract carrier to test a driver involved in a crash involving certain injuries for
63 alcohol and controlled substances as soon as practicable after the crash. Section 17 requires a
64 railroad contract carrier to transmit the results of any post-crash testing of a driver to the
65 Authority. Section 18 requires a railroad contract carrier to annually inspect each transport
66 vehicle operated by the carrier. Section 18 further requires a railroad contract carrier to
67 [develop] adopt a vehicle safety and maintenance policy, which must provide for the weekly
68 inspection of parts and accessories of each transport vehicle. Section 18 requires each
69 transport vehicle operated by a railroad contract carrier to be equipped with certain equipment
70 and safety features.
71 Existing law requires motor carriers regulated by the Authority to maintain a liability
72 insurance policy in such amounts as the Authority may designate. (NRS 706.291) Section 19
73 instead requires each railroad contract carrier to maintain a certain minimum amount of
74 liability coverage and uninsured and underinsured vehicle coverage. Section 25 of this bill
75 clarifies that the insurance requirements of section 19 apply only to railroad contract carriers

Assembly Amendment No. 320 to Assembly Bill No. 446 Page 5
76 and not to other contract motor carriers, which are still required to maintain the minimum
77 amount of coverage prescribed by the Authority. Additionally, section 20 requires a railroad
78 contract carrier to provide a bond to the Authority in an amount of not less than $5,000,000 to
79 ensure the compliance of the railroad contract carrier with the provisions of sections 8-20.
80 Existing law declares all contract motor carriers to be affected with a public interest and
81 subject to the permitting, regulatory and enforcement authority of the Authority. (NRS
82 706.156) Section 22 of this bill requires a railroad contract carrier to comply with the
83 provisions of sections 8-20 in the same manner as the carrier is required to comply with other
84 requirements and regulations applicable to contract motor carriers generally. Sections 26-30
85 of this bill provide for the enforcement of sections 8-20 by the Authority in the same manner
86 as other provisions relating to motor carriers. Section 23 of this bill clarifies that the
87 requirements of sections 8-20 are inapplicable to vehicles leased to or owned by certain
88 governmental entities. Section 24 of this bill requires a railroad contract carrier to display
89 certain identifying information on each vehicle it operates. Sections 9-14 define certain terms
90 relating to railroad contract carriers and section 8 establishes the applicability of those
91 definitions. Section 21 of this bill applies definitions in existing law relating to the regulation
92 of motor carriers to sections 8-20.
