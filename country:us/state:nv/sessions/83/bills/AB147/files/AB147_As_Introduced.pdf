Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires, under certain circumstances, a person to provide certain
2 information to vote in person which may include, depending on the circumstances,
3 proof of residency and identity, answering questions covering the voter’s personal
4 data or providing additional personal data. (NRS 293.2725, 293.277, 293.285,
5 293.303, 293.3081, 293.3082, 293.3085, 293.3585, 293.541, 293C.270, 293C.275,
6 293C.292, 293C.3035, 293C.3585) Sections 11, 13, 14, 17, 22, 38, 40, 41, 43 and
7 45 of this bill require, with certain exceptions, that a person provide one of the
8 forms of proof of identity specified in section 2 of this bill to vote in person.
9 Section 2 sets forth the acceptable forms of proof of identity which include: (1) a
10 driver’s license or identification card issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles;
11 (2) an identification card issued by this State or another state, the District of
12 Columbia, any territory of the United States or the United States Government; (3)
13 an identification card issued by a college or university within the Nevada System of

15 card issued to an employee by this State or an agency or political subdivision
16 thereof, or the United States Government; (5) a passport issued by the United States
17 Government; (6) a military identification card issued by any branch of the Armed
18 Forces of the United States; (7) an identification card issued by a federally

23 verification to reflect the contents of certain forms of proof of identity which are
24 included in section 2. Section 15 of this bill requires the Secretary of State and
25 each county and city clerk to ensure that instructions concerning the proof of
26 identity required to vote are posted at each polling place. Sections 5, 6, 10, 12, 21,
27 23-32, 34, 39 and 44 of this bill make various conforming changes to existing
28 provisions to reflect the requirement to provide proof of identity to vote in person.
29 Sections 3 and 4 of this bill: (1) require the Department of Motor Vehicles to
30 issue an identification card, free of charge, to a registered voter who does not
31 possess one of the acceptable forms of proof of identity and attests that he or she is
32 experiencing financial hardship; and (2) require the registered voter to submit
33 certain information with an application for the identification card. Section 46 of
34 this bill makes conforming changes to reflect that such identification card must be
35 issued free of charge.
36 Existing law requires a voter who votes by mail ballot to affix his or her
37 signature on the return envelope of the mail ballot for the county clerk or city clerk
38 to check the signature to verify the identity of the voter. (NRS 293.269917,
39 293.269927, 293C.26316, 293C.26327) Sections 8 and 36 of this bill also require a
40 voter who votes by mail ballot to write on the return envelope the last four digits of
41 his or her driver’s license number issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles or,
42 if he or she does not have such a number, the last four digits of his or her social
43 security number. If he or she does not have a driver’s license or a social security
44 number, sections 8 and 36 require the voter to provide the identification number
45 issued to the voter by the county clerk when he or she registered to vote. Sections 9
46 and 37 of this bill require the county clerk and city clerk to verify that the
47 identifying numbers written on the return envelope match the information of the
48 voter in the records of the county clerk or city clerk. Sections 7 and 35 of this bill
49 require the return envelope sent with a mail ballot to each active registered voter to
50 include a flap to cover the signature and identifying numbers of the voter.
51 Sections 16 and 42 of this bill provide that a person applying to vote whose
52 identity has been challenged must furnish proof of identity in response to such a
53 challenge.
54 Section 18 of this bill authorizes, under certain circumstances, a person who
55 fails to provide proof of identity when voting in person to cast a provisional ballot.
56 Section 19 of this bill makes conforming changes to the information that must be
57 provided to a person who casts a provisional ballot. Section 20 of this bill provides
58 that the provisional ballot of such a voter must be counted if the person provides
59 proof of identity to the county clerk or city clerk, not later than 5 p.m. on the Friday
60 following election day.
61 Section 33 of this bill clarifies that voting the mail ballot of another person is a
62 category D felony.

45 address of the residence where the candidate actually, as opposed to
-
*AB147*

– 7 –
1 constructively, resides in accordance with NRS 281.050, if one has
2 been assigned. The declaration of candidacy must not be accepted
3 for filing if the candidate fails to comply with the following
4 provisions of this subsection or, if applicable, the provisions of

6 (a) The candidate shall not list the candidate’s address as a post

18 4. If the candidate executes an oath or affirmation under

21 because a street address has not been assigned to the candidate’s

24 required by subsection 3, the candidate shall present to the filing
25 officer:
26 (a) A valid driver’s license or identification card issued by a
27 governmental agency that contains a photograph of the candidate;
28 and
29 (b) Alternative proof of the candidate’s residential address that
30 the filing officer determines is sufficient to verify where the

33 regulations establishing the forms of alternative proof of the
34 candidate’s residential address that the filing officer may accept to

36 resides in accordance with NRS 281.050.
37 5. The filing officer shall retain a copy of the documents and
38 proof of [identity and] residency provided by the candidate pursuant

1 pursuant to NRS 293.182. Service of such process must first be
2 attempted at the appropriate address as specified by the candidate in
3 the declaration of candidacy. If the candidate cannot be served at
4 that address, service must be made by personally delivering to and
5 leaving with the filing officer duplicate copies of the process. The
6 filing officer shall immediately send, by registered or certified mail,
7 one of the copies to the candidate at the specified address, unless the
8 candidate has designated in writing to the filing officer a different
9 address for that purpose, in which case the filing officer shall mail
10 the copy to the last address so designated.
11 7. If the filing officer receives credible evidence indicating that
12 a candidate has been convicted of a felony and has not had his or her
13 civil rights restored, the filing officer:
14 (a) May conduct an investigation to determine whether the
15 candidate has been convicted of a felony and, if so, whether the
16 candidate has had his or her civil rights restored; and
17 (b) Shall transmit the credible evidence and the findings from
18 such investigation to the Attorney General, if the filing officer is the

25 9. Any person who knowingly and willfully files a declaration
26 of candidacy which contains a false statement in violation of this
27 section is guilty of a gross misdemeanor.

23 of the county clerk;
24 (b) If, pursuant to subparagraph (3) of paragraph (d) of

39 (b) If the electronic device does not match the signature of the

9 4. For purposes of subsection 3:
10 (a) There is a reasonable question of fact as to whether the

13 significant and obvious respects from the signatures of the voter
14 available in the records of the clerk.
15 (b) There is not a reasonable question of fact as to whether the
16 signature used for the mail ballot matches the signature of the voter
17 if:
18 (1) The signature used for the mail ballot is a variation of the
19 signature of the voter caused by the substitution of initials for the
20 first or middle name, the substitution of a different type of
21 punctuation in the first, middle or last name, the use of a common
22 nickname or the use of one last name for a person who has two last

27 used for the mail ballot and the signatures of the voter available in
28 the records of the clerk.
