Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, certain employees have the
2 right to take an unpaid leave of absence from work for certain medical or family
3 reasons, including, without limitation: (1) because of a serious health condition of
4 the employee that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of his or her
5 position; (2) to care for certain family members who have a serious health
6 condition; or (3) to care for certain veterans or members of the Armed Forces who
7 have suffered a serious injury or illness. (29 U.S.C. § 2612) The Act authorizes an
8 employer of an employee who requests leave for one of those reasons to require the
9 employee to provide a certification issued by a health care provider that contains
10 certain information concerning the serious health condition or serious injury or
11 illness. (29 U.S.C. § 2613; 29 C.F.R. §§ 825.305-825.310) This bill prohibits a
12 provider of health care from charging a person any fee or charge to fill out a form
13 for such a certification if the provider of health care has examined, treated or
14 otherwise provided health care services to the person who is the subject of the
15 certification within the immediately preceding 3 years. If the provider of health has
16 not examined, treated or otherwise provided health care services to the person who
17 is the subject of the certification within the immediately preceding 3 years, this bill
