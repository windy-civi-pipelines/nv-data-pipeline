Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 This bill enacts various provisions relating to “artificial intelligence systems,” which
2 section 4 of this bill defines to mean any machine-based system that, for any explicit or
3 implicit objective, infers from the inputs such system receives how to generate outputs,
4 including, without limitation, content, decisions, predictions or recommendations, that can
5 influence physical or virtual environments.
6 Sections 6-12 of this bill provide for the registration and regulation of “artificial
7 intelligence companies,” which section 3 of this bill defines to mean, in general, a person who
8 develops an artificial intelligence system that is primarily used to generate certain material
9 or is trained using certain data and either sells the system to another person or enters into a
10 contractual arrangement with another person [to allow] that, by its terms, allows customers
11 of the person to use the artificial intelligence system [.] in exchange for a fee paid by the
12 person to the artificial intelligence company. Section 6 requires an artificial intelligence
13 company to be registered with the Bureau of Consumer Protection in the Office of the
14 Attorney General. Sections 6-8 set forth various requirements for the issuance and renewal of
15 such a registration.
16 [Section 9 requires an artificial intelligence company to develop, implement and maintain
17 certain policies, procedures and protocols. Section 10 requires an artificial intelligence
Senate Amendment No. 304 to Senate Bill No. 199 Page 4
18 company to conduct a semiannual self-assessment and submit the results of the self-
19 assessment to the Bureau.] Section 11 authorizes the Bureau to impose certain penalties [for
20 violations of the provisions of sections 6-10.] against a person who fails to register as
21 required in section 6. Section 12 authorizes the Bureau to adopt regulations to carry out the
22 provisions of sections 6-11.
23 Section 13 of this bill requires a person who sells computer software that is capable of
24 generating legal documents through the use of an artificial intelligence system , with certain
25 exceptions, to ensure that each such document generated is reviewed by a licensed attorney
26 before the document is provided to a customer in this State.
27 Section 14 of this bill requires the operator of a [search website] social media platform
28 that provides users both a method to conduct a search on the platform that [uses] will result
29 in information concerning the search being used to train an artificial intelligence system
30 and a method that [does not use an artificial intelligence system] will not have that result to:
31 (1) require a user to opt in to use the method that [uses] will result in the information
32 concerning the search being used to train an artificial intelligence system; and (2) allow a
33 user that does not opt in to continue to use the method that [does not use an artificial
34 intelligence system] will not have that result so long as the operator offers the method.
35 Section 15 of this bill prohibits a person who is paid money for a service on the condition
36 that the service be provided by a natural person from providing the service through an image
37 of a natural person generated by an artificial intelligence system.
38 Section 16 of this bill requires the Department of Employment, Training and
39 Rehabilitation to [collect information concerning] develop a survey to be sent to certain
40 employers in order to determine the number and type of jobs that have been lost in this
41 State because of the use of artificial intelligence systems and submit an annual report to the
42 Governor and the Legislature regarding the information collected [.] from the survey.
43 Sections 16 and 16.5 of this bill provide for the confidentiality of certain information
44 collected from the survey.
45 Section 17 of this bill requires a county recorder to develop, implement and maintain
46 policies, procedures and protocols to verify the identity of any person filing a document and to
47 protect against fraud committed in the filing of a document through the use of an artificial
48 intelligence system.
49 Section 18 of this bill [prohibits a peace officer from using an artificial intelligence
50 system to generate an investigative or police report.
51 Section 19 of this bill prohibits, with certain exceptions, certain teachers from using an
52 artificial intelligence system to generate a class lesson plan.] requires each law enforcement
53 agency to develop, maintain and periodically update a policy concerning the use of
54 artificial intelligence systems by the law enforcement agency. Section 18 requires the
55 policy and any update to the policy to be submitted to the Bureau of Consumer
56 Protection.
57 Section 26 of this bill requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction to establish the
58 Working Group on the Use of Artificial Intelligence Systems in Education to conduct an
59 assessment and develop certain policies and guidance relating to the use of artificial
60 intelligence systems during the 2025-2026 interim.
61 The Nevada Unfair Trade Practice Act sets forth various activities that constitute an
62 unlawful contract, combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade and authorizes the Attorney
63 General to investigate and take certain actions against persons who engage in such activities,
64 which may include, without limitation, criminal prosecution and the imposition of civil
65 penalties. (Chapter 598A of NRS) Section 20 of this bill includes among the activities that
66 constitute an unlawful contract, combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade the
67 establishment by a landlord of a price for rent for a dwelling unit that is based upon a
68 recommendation provided by certain artificial intelligence systems that generate
69 recommended prices for rent using certain nonpublic information provided by multiple
70 landlords.
71 Section 21 of this bill [prohibits a financial institution from using any data collected by
72 the financial institution relating to the finances of a customer to train an] authorizes the

78 insurer from using any data collected by the insurer relating to the health of an insured to train
79 an artificial intelligence system developed by the insurer without providing certain notice and
80 obtaining the consent of the customer to whom such data relates.
81 Existing law sets forth various practices that constitute an unfair or deceptive trade
82 practice in the business of insurance. (NRS 686A.010-686A.310) Section 25 of this bill
83 requires an insurer to adopt practices designed to ensure that the use of an artificial
84 intelligence system by the insurer does not result in the commission of an unfair or deceptive
85 trade practice. Section 25 also requires an insurer to develop, implement and maintain a plan
86 for the responsible use of artificial intelligence systems by the insurer and sets forth certain
87 requirements for such a plan.
88 Section 22 of this bill applies the definitions set forth under the provisions of existing law
89 governing financial institutions to the provisions of section 21.

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 This bill enacts various provisions relating to “artificial intelligence systems,” which
2 section 4 of this bill defines to mean any machine-based system that, for any explicit or
3 implicit objective, infers from the inputs such system receives how to generate outputs,
4 including, without limitation, content, decisions, predictions or recommendations, that can
5 influence physical or virtual environments.
6 Sections 6-12 of this bill provide for the registration and regulation of “artificial
7 intelligence companies,” which section 3 of this bill defines to mean, in general, a person who
8 develops an artificial intelligence system that is primarily used to generate certain material
9 or is trained using certain data and either sells the system to another person or enters into a
10 contractual arrangement with another person [to allow] that, by its terms, allows customers
11 of the person to use the artificial intelligence system [.] in exchange for a fee paid by the
12 person to the artificial intelligence company. Section 6 requires an artificial intelligence
13 company to be registered with the Bureau of Consumer Protection in the Office of the
14 Attorney General. Sections 6-8 set forth various requirements for the issuance and renewal of
15 such a registration.
16 [Section 9 requires an artificial intelligence company to develop, implement and maintain
17 certain policies, procedures and protocols. Section 10 requires an artificial intelligence

Senate Amendment No. 304 to Senate Bill No. 199 Page 4
18 company to conduct a semiannual self-assessment and submit the results of the self-
19 assessment to the Bureau.] Section 11 authorizes the Bureau to impose certain penalties [for
20 violations of the provisions of sections 6-10.] against a person who fails to register as
21 required in section 6. Section 12 authorizes the Bureau to adopt regulations to carry out the
22 provisions of sections 6-11.
23 Section 13 of this bill requires a person who sells computer software that is capable of
24 generating legal documents through the use of an artificial intelligence system , with certain
25 exceptions, to ensure that each such document generated is reviewed by a licensed attorney
26 before the document is provided to a customer in this State.
27 Section 14 of this bill requires the operator of a [search website] social media platform
28 that provides users both a method to conduct a search on the platform that [uses] will result
29 in information concerning the search being used to train an artificial intelligence system
30 and a method that [does not use an artificial intelligence system] will not have that result to:
31 (1) require a user to opt in to use the method that [uses] will result in the information
32 concerning the search being used to train an artificial intelligence system; and (2) allow a
33 user that does not opt in to continue to use the method that [does not use an artificial
34 intelligence system] will not have that result so long as the operator offers the method.
35 Section 15 of this bill prohibits a person who is paid money for a service on the condition
36 that the service be provided by a natural person from providing the service through an image
37 of a natural person generated by an artificial intelligence system.
38 Section 16 of this bill requires the Department of Employment, Training and
39 Rehabilitation to [collect information concerning] develop a survey to be sent to certain
40 employers in order to determine the number and type of jobs that have been lost in this

43 Sections 16 and 16.5 of this bill provide for the confidentiality of certain information
44 collected from the survey.
45 Section 17 of this bill requires a county recorder to develop, implement and maintain
46 policies, procedures and protocols to verify the identity of any person filing a document and to
47 protect against fraud committed in the filing of a document through the use of an artificial
48 intelligence system.
49 Section 18 of this bill [prohibits a peace officer from using an artificial intelligence
50 system to generate an investigative or police report.
51 Section 19 of this bill prohibits, with certain exceptions, certain teachers from using an
52 artificial intelligence system to generate a class lesson plan.] requires each law enforcement
53 agency to develop, maintain and periodically update a policy concerning the use of
54 artificial intelligence systems by the law enforcement agency. Section 18 requires the
55 policy and any update to the policy to be submitted to the Bureau of Consumer
56 Protection.
57 Section 26 of this bill requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction to establish the
58 Working Group on the Use of Artificial Intelligence Systems in Education to conduct an
59 assessment and develop certain policies and guidance relating to the use of artificial
60 intelligence systems during the 2025-2026 interim.
