Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 This bill enacts various provisions relating to “artificial intelligence systems,”
2 which section 4 of this bill defines to mean any machine-based system that, for any
3 explicit or implicit objective, infers from the inputs such system receives how to
4 generate outputs, including, without limitation, content, decisions, predictions or
5 recommendations, that can influence physical or virtual environments.
6 Sections 6-12 of this bill provide for the registration and regulation of
7 “artificial intelligence companies,” which section 3 of this bill defines to mean, in
8 general, a person who develops an artificial intelligence system and either sells the
-
*SB199*

– 2 –
9 system to another person or enters into a contractual arrangement with another
10 person to allow customers of the person to use the artificial intelligence system.
11 Section 6 requires an artificial intelligence company to be registered with the
12 Bureau of Consumer Protection in the Office of the Attorney General. Sections 6-8
13 set forth various requirements for the issuance and renewal of such a registration.
14 Section 9 requires an artificial intelligence company to develop, implement and
15 maintain certain policies, procedures and protocols. Section 10 requires an artificial
16 intelligence company to conduct a semiannual self-assessment and submit the
17 results of the self-assessment to the Bureau. Section 11 authorizes the Bureau to
18 impose certain penalties for violations of the provisions of sections 6-10. Section
19 12 authorizes the Bureau to adopt regulations to carry out the provisions of sections
20 6-11.
21 Section 13 of this bill requires a person who sells computer software that is
22 capable of generating legal documents through the use of an artificial intelligence
23 system to ensure that each such document generated is reviewed by a licensed
24 attorney before the document is provided to a customer in this State.
25 Section 14 of this bill requires the operator of a search website that provides
26 users both a method to conduct a search that uses an artificial intelligence system
27 and a method that does not use an artificial intelligence system to: (1) require a user
28 to opt in to use the method that uses an artificial intelligence system; and (2) allow
29 a user that does not opt in to continue to use the method that does not use an
30 artificial intelligence system so long as the operator offers the method.
31 Section 15 of this bill prohibits a person who is paid money for a service on the
32 condition that the service be provided by a natural person from providing the
33 service through an image of a natural person generated by an artificial intelligence
34 system.
35 Section 16 of this bill requires the Department of Employment, Training and
36 Rehabilitation to collect information concerning the number and type of jobs that
37 have been lost in this State because of the use of artificial intelligence systems and
38 submit an annual report to the Governor and the Legislature regarding the
39 information collected.
40 Section 17 of this bill requires a county recorder to develop, implement and
41 maintain policies, procedures and protocols to verify the identity of any person
42 filing a document and to protect against fraud committed in the filing of a
43 document through the use of an artificial intelligence system.
44 Section 18 of this bill prohibits a peace officer from using an artificial
45 intelligence system to generate an investigative or police report.
46 Section 19 of this bill prohibits, with certain exceptions, certain teachers from
47 using an artificial intelligence system to generate a class lesson plan. Section 26 of
48 this bill requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction to establish the Working
49 Group on the Use of Artificial Intelligence Systems in Education to conduct an
50 assessment and develop certain policies and guidance relating to the use of artificial
51 intelligence systems during the 2025-2026 interim.
52 The Nevada Unfair Trade Practice Act sets forth various activities that
53 constitute an unlawful contract, combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade and
54 authorizes the Attorney General to investigate and take certain actions against
55 persons who engage in such activities, which may include, without limitation,
56 criminal prosecution and the imposition of civil penalties. (Chapter 598A of NRS)
57 Section 20 of this bill includes among the activities that constitute an unlawful
58 contract, combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade the establishment by a
59 landlord of a price for rent for a dwelling unit that is based upon a recommendation
60 provided by certain artificial intelligence systems that generate recommended
61 prices for rent using certain nonpublic information provided by multiple landlords.
62 Section 21 of this bill prohibits a financial institution from using any data
63 collected by the financial institution relating to the finances of a customer to train
-
*SB199*

64 an artificial intelligence system developed by the financial institution or providing
65 such data to an artificial intelligence company without providing certain notice and
66 obtaining the consent of the customer to whom such data relates. Section 24 of this
67 bill similarly prohibits an insurer from using any data collected by the insurer
68 relating to the health of an insured to train an artificial intelligence system
69 developed by the insurer without providing certain notice and obtaining the consent
70 of the customer to whom such data relates.
71 Existing law sets forth various practices that constitute an unfair or deceptive
72 trade practice in the business of insurance. (NRS 686A.010-686A.310) Section 25
73 of this bill requires an insurer to adopt practices designed to ensure that the use of
74 an artificial intelligence system by the insurer does not result in the commission of
75 an unfair or deceptive trade practice. Section 25 also requires an insurer to develop,
76 implement and maintain a plan for the responsible use of artificial intelligence
77 systems by the insurer and sets forth certain requirements for such a plan.
78 Section 22 of this bill applies the definitions set forth under the provisions of
79 existing law governing financial institutions to the provisions of section 21.
