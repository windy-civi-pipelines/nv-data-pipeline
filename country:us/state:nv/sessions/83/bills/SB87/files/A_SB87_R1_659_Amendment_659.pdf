AN ACT relating to forensic medical examinations; [eliminating the authority of a
compensation officer appointed by the Director of the Department of
Health and Human Services to order the payment of compensation to
reimburse a county for the costs of certain forensic medical
examinations; requiring the State to pay, with certain limitations,]
revising provisions relating to payment of the costs of a forensic
medical examination of a victim of a sexual assault or domestic
violence battery by strangulation; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law: (1) requires a county in whose jurisdiction a sexual assault is committed to
2 pay any costs incurred by a hospital for the forensic medical examination of the victim; and
3 (2) authorizes a compensation officer appointed by the Director of the Department of Health
4 and Human Services to order the payment of compensation to reimburse a county for the costs
5 of the forensic medical examination. (NRS 217.160, 217.300) Section [2 of this bill instead
6 requires the State to pay, with certain limitations, the costs for such a forensic medical
7 examination. Section] 1 of this bill [eliminates the authority of] authorizes a compensation
8 officer to order the payment of compensation to [reimburse a county] a medical provider for
9 the costs of such a forensic medical examination. Section 2 of this bill provides that the
10 costs of such a forensic medical examination must be paid out of the Fund for the
11 Compensation of Victims of Crime, unless there is not sufficient money in the Fund to
12 pay such costs. If there is not sufficient money in the Fund to pay such costs, section 2
13 requires the county in whose jurisdiction the sexual assault was committed to pay any
14 remaining costs. Section 2 also: (1) requires the Department of Health and Human
15 Services to review and establish a maximum annual reimbursement rate that may be
16 paid to a medical provider for each forensic medical examination performed on a victim;
17 and (2) provides that the amount of reimbursement paid to a medical provider for the
18 costs of such a forensic medical examination must not exceed that maximum annual
19 reimbursement rate.

20 Existing law requires a county in whose jurisdiction a domestic violence battery by
21 strangulation is committed to pay any costs incurred by a hospital for a strangulation forensic
22 medical examination of the victim. (NRS 217.405) [Section] Sections 1 and 3 of this bill
23 [instead requires the State to pay, with certain limitations, the costs for such] enact provisions
24 relating to the payment of costs to a medical provider for a strangulation forensic
25 medical examination performed on a victim of a domestic battery by strangulation that
26 are similar to the provisions in this bill for payment of the costs of a forensic medical
27 examination [.] performed on a victim of sexual assault.
