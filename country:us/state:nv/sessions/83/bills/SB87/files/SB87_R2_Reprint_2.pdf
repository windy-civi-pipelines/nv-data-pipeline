AN ACT relating to forensic medical examinations; revising
provisions relating to payment of the costs of a forensic
medical examination of a victim of a sexual assault or
domestic violence battery by strangulation; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law: (1) requires a county in whose jurisdiction a sexual assault is
2 committed to pay any costs incurred by a hospital for the forensic medical
3 examination of the victim; and (2) authorizes a compensation officer appointed by
4 the Director of the Department of Health and Human Services to order the payment
5 of compensation to reimburse a county for the costs of the forensic medical
6 examination. (NRS 217.160, 217.300) Section 1 of this bill authorizes a
7 compensation officer to order the payment of compensation to a medical provider
8 for the costs of such a forensic medical examination. Section 2 of this bill provides
9 that the costs of such a forensic medical examination must be paid out of the Fund
10 for the Compensation of Victims of Crime, unless there is not sufficient money in
11 the Fund to pay such costs. If there is not sufficient money in the Fund to pay such
12 costs, section 2 requires the county in whose jurisdiction the sexual assault was
13 committed to pay any remaining costs. Section 2 also: (1) requires the Department
14 of Health and Human Services to review and establish a maximum annual
15 reimbursement rate that may be paid to a medical provider for each forensic
16 medical examination performed on a victim; and (2) provides that the amount of
17 reimbursement paid to a medical provider for the costs of such a forensic medical
18 examination must not exceed that maximum annual reimbursement rate.
19 Existing law requires a county in whose jurisdiction a domestic violence battery
20 by strangulation is committed to pay any costs incurred by a hospital for a
