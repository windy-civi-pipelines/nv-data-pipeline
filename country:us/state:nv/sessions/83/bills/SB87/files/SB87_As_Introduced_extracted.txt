AN ACT relating to forensic medical examinations; eliminating the
authority of a compensation officer appointed by the
Director of the Department of Health and Human Services

county for the costs of certain forensic medical
examinations; requiring the State to pay from the State

2 committed to pay any costs incurred by a hospital for the forensic medical
3 examination of the victim; and (2) authorizes a compensation officer appointed by
4 the Director of the Department of Health and Human Services to order the payment
5 of compensation to reimburse a county for the costs of the forensic medical
6 examination. (NRS 217.160, 217.300) Section 2 of this bill instead requires the
7 State to pay from the State General Fund the costs for such a forensic medical
8 examination. Section 1 of this bill eliminates the authority of a compensation
9 officer to order the payment of compensation to reimburse a county for the costs of
10 such a forensic medical examination.
11 Existing law requires a county in whose jurisdiction a domestic violence battery
12 by strangulation is committed to pay any costs incurred by a hospital for a
