Section 1:
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to forensic medical examinations; revising
provisions relating to payment of the costs of a forensic
medical examination of a victim of a sexual assault or
domestic violence battery by strangulation; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law: (1) requires a county in whose jurisdiction a sexual assault is
committed to pay any costs incurred by a hospital for the forensic medical
examination of the victim; and (2) authorizes a compensation officer appointed by
the Director of the Department of Health and Human Services to order the payment
of compensation to reimburse a county for the costs of the forensic medical
examination. (NRS 217.160, 217.300) Section 1 of this bill authorizes a
compensation officer to order the payment of compensation to a medical provider
for the costs of such a forensic medical examination. Section 2 of this bill provides
that the costs of such a forensic medical examination must be paid out of the Fund
for the Compensation of Victims of Crime, unless there is not sufficient money in
the Fund to pay such costs. If there is not sufficient money in the Fund to pay such
costs, section 2 requires the county in whose jurisdiction the sexual assault was
committed to pay any remaining costs. Section 2 also: (1) requires the Department
of Health and Human Services to review and establish a maximum annual
reimbursement rate that may be paid to a medical provider for each forensic
medical examination performed on a victim; and (2) provides that the amount of
reimbursement paid to a medical provider for the costs of such a forensic medical
examination must not exceed that maximum annual reimbursement rate.
Existing law requires a county in whose jurisdiction a domestic violence battery
by strangulation is committed to pay any costs incurred by a hospital for a
strangulation forensic medical examination of the victim. (NRS 217.405) Sections
1 and 3 of this bill enact provisions relating to the payment of costs to a medical
provider for a strangulation forensic medical examination performed on a victim of
a domestic battery by strangulation that are similar to the provisions in this bill for
payment of the costs of a forensic medical examination performed on a victim of
sexual assault.
