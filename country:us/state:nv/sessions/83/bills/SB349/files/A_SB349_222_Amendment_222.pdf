AN ACT relating to anatomical gifts; authorizing a procurement organization to
transport or arrange for the transportation of the body or part of a
deceased donor under certain circumstances; authorizing a coroner to
require a procurement organization to provide notice of such
transportation; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 The Revised Uniform Anatomical Gift Act establishes the rights of donors and other
2 persons to affirmatively make anatomical gifts of human bodies and parts for the purpose of
3 transplantation, therapy, research or education. (NRS 451.500-451.598) The Uniform Act also
4 sets forth the rights and duties of organizations that procure anatomical gifts. (NRS 451.579)
5 This bill authorizes a procurement organization to transport, or arrange for the transportation
6 of, the body or part of a deceased donor [as necessary to facilitate an anatomical gift.] if
7 medical equipment is necessary to ensure the medical suitability of the body or part.
8 This bill also authorizes a coroner to require a procurement organization to notify the
9 coroner if the procurement organization provides or arranges for such transportation
10 within the jurisdiction of the coroner.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 451.579 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 451.579 1. When a hospital refers a natural person at or near death to a
3 procurement organization, the organization shall make a reasonable search of the
4 records of any donor registry that it knows exists for the geographical area in which
5 the natural person resides to ascertain whether the natural person has made an
6 anatomical gift.
7 2. When a hospital refers a natural person at or near death to a procurement
8 organization, the organization may conduct any reasonable examination necessary
9 to ensure the medical suitability of a part that is or could be the subject of an
10 anatomical gift for transplantation, therapy, research or education from a donor or a
11 prospective donor. During the examination period, measures necessary to ensure

Senate Amendment No. 222 to Senate Bill No. 349 Page 4
1 the medical suitability of the part may not be withdrawn unless the hospital or
2 procurement organization knows that the natural person expressed a contrary intent.
3 3. Unless prohibited by law other than NRS 451.500 to 451.598, inclusive, at
4 any time after a donor’s death, the person to which a part passes under NRS
5 451.571 may conduct any reasonable examination necessary to ensure the medical
6 suitability of the body or part for its intended purpose.
7 4. Unless prohibited by law other than NRS 451.500 to 451.598, inclusive, an
8 examination under subsection 2 or 3 may include an examination of all medical and
9 dental records of the donor or prospective donor.
10 5. Upon the death of a minor who was a donor or had signed a refusal, unless
11 a procurement organization knows the minor is emancipated, the procurement
12 organization shall conduct a reasonable search for the parents of the minor and
13 provide the parents with an opportunity to revoke or amend the anatomical gift or
14 revoke the refusal.
15 6. Upon referral by a hospital under subsection 1, a procurement organization
16 shall make a reasonable search for any person listed in NRS 451.566 having
17 priority to make an anatomical gift on behalf of a prospective donor. If a
18 procurement organization receives information that an anatomical gift to any other
19 person was made, amended or revoked, it shall promptly advise the other person of
20 all relevant information.
21 7. Subject to subsection 10 of NRS 451.571 and 451.597, the rights of the
22 person to which a part passes under NRS 451.571 are superior to the rights of all
23 others with respect to the part. The person may accept or reject an anatomical gift in
24 whole or in part. Subject to the terms of the document of gift and NRS 451.500 to
25 451.598, inclusive, a person that accepts an anatomical gift of an entire body may
26 allow embalming, burial or cremation, and use of remains in a funeral service. If
27 the gift is of a part, the person to which the part passes under NRS 451.571, upon
28 the death of the donor and before embalming, burial or cremation, shall cause the
29 part to be removed without unnecessary mutilation.
30 8. Neither the physician who attends the decedent at death nor the physician
31 who determines the time of the decedent’s death may participate in the procedures
32 for removing or transplanting a part from the decedent.
33 9. A physician or technician may remove a donated part from the body of a
34 donor that the physician or technician is qualified to remove.
35 10. In the absence of an express, contrary indication by the donor or other
36 person authorized to make an anatomical gift, if an anatomical gift of a part has
37 been made for the purpose of transplantation or therapy and the part is medically
38 suitable for that purpose, the appropriate procurement organization shall discuss
39 with a person authorized to make an anatomical gift under NRS 451.556 the
40 person’s willingness to make an anatomical gift of any other part for the purpose of
41 research or education.
42 11. A procurement organization may transport [,] within this State, or
43 arrange for the transportation within this State of, the body or part of a deceased
44 donor [as necessary to facilitate an anatomical gift, including, without limitation,
45 to facilitate:
46 (a) The removal or transplant of a part that is the subject of an anatomical
47 gift; or
48 (b) The return of the remainder of a body from which a part that was the
49 subject of an anatomical gift was removed to the custody of the person under
50 obligation to dispose of the body.] if medical equipment is necessary to ensure the
51 medical suitability of the body or part.
52 12. A county coroner may require a procurement organization to notify the
53 coroner, in such manner as the coroner may prescribe, if the procurement

1 organization transports or arranges for the transportation of a body or part of a
2 deceased donor pursuant to subsection 11 within the jurisdiction of the coroner.
3 Sec. 2. This act becomes effective on July 1, 2025.
