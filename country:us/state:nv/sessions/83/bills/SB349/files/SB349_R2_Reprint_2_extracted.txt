4 reasonable search of the records of any donor registry that it knows
5 exists for the geographical area in which the natural person resides
6 to ascertain whether the natural person has made an anatomical gift.
7 2. When a hospital refers a natural person at or near death to a
8 procurement organization, the organization may conduct any
9 reasonable examination necessary to ensure the medical suitability
10 of a part that is or could be the subject of an anatomical gift for
11 transplantation, therapy, research or education from a donor or a
12 prospective donor. During the examination period, measures
13 necessary to ensure the medical suitability of the part may not be
14 withdrawn unless the hospital or procurement organization knows

16 3. Unless prohibited by law other than NRS 451.500 to
17 451.598, inclusive, at any time after a donor’s death, the person to

23 include an examination of all medical and dental records of the
24 donor or prospective donor.
25 5. Upon the death of a minor who was a donor or had signed a
26 refusal, unless a procurement organization knows the minor is
27 emancipated, the procurement organization shall conduct a
28 reasonable search for the parents of the minor and provide the
29 parents with an opportunity to revoke or amend the anatomical gift
30 or revoke the refusal.
31 6. Upon referral by a hospital under subsection 1, a
32 procurement organization shall make a reasonable search for any
33 person listed in NRS 451.566 having priority to make an anatomical
34 gift on behalf of a prospective donor. If a procurement organization
35 receives information that an anatomical gift to any other person was
36 made, amended or revoked, it shall promptly advise the other person
37 of all relevant information.
38 7. Subject to subsection 10 of NRS 451.571 and 451.597, the
39 rights of the person to which a part passes under NRS 451.571 are

10 from the decedent.

12 the body of a donor that the physician or technician is qualified to
13 remove.
14 10. In the absence of an express, contrary indication by the
15 donor or other person authorized to make an anatomical gift, if an
16 anatomical gift of a part has been made for the purpose of
17 transplantation or therapy and the part is medically suitable for that
18 purpose, the appropriate procurement organization shall discuss
19 with a person authorized to make an anatomical gift under NRS
20 451.556 the person’s willingness to make an anatomical gift of any
21 other part for the purpose of research or education.
22 11. A procurement organization may transport within this
23 State, or arrange for the transportation within this State of, the
