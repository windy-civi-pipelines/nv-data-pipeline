exists for the geographical area in which the natural person resides
to ascertain whether the natural person has made an anatomical gift.
2. When a hospital refers a natural person at or near death to a

of a part that is or could be the subject of an anatomical gift for

prospective donor. During the examination period, measures
necessary to ensure the medical suitability of the part may not be
