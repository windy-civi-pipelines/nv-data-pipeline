AN ACT relating to emergency management; creating the Nevada Hazard
Mitigation Revolving Loan Account in the State General Fund;
requiring the Division of Emergency Management of the Office of the
Military to develop and carry out a program to grant loans to certain
eligible recipients to fund hazard mitigation projects; requiring the
Division to adopt regulations relating to the loan program; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 The federal Safeguarding Tomorrow through Ongoing Risk Mitigation Act, more
2 commonly known as the “STORM Act,” authorizes the Administrator of the Federal
3 Emergency Management Agency to provide capitalization grants to a state for the purpose of
4 providing financial assistance in the form of loans to local governments and tribal
5 governments for hazard mitigation projects. The STORM Act requires a state which receives
6 such a capitalization grant to establish a loan fund. (42 U.S.C. § 5135)
7 Existing state law creates the Division of Emergency Management within the Office of
8 the Military, which has various powers and duties related to emergency management. (NRS
9 414.040)
10 Section 8 of this bill creates the Nevada Hazard Mitigation Revolving Loan Account in
11 the State General Fund as a revolving loan account administered by the Division.
12 Section 9 of this bill requires the Division to develop and carry out a program for an
13 eligible recipient to apply for a loan from the Account for the purpose of financing a hazard
14 mitigation project. Section 9 further: (1) requires the Division to prioritize approving loans for
15 hazard mitigation projects that will have the greatest impact on mitigating hazards in this
16 State; [and] (2) with certain exceptions, requires the Division to condition a loan of money
17 from the Account on compliance by an eligible entity with certain provisions concerning
18 prevailing wages and competitive bidding; and (3) authorizes the Division to provide
19 certain technical assistance to eligible recipients.
20 Section 10 of this bill provides that any loan of money from the Account must not be
21 used to replace or supplant any other money available to an eligible recipient for hazard
22 mitigation.

25 for a loan from the Account; and (2) the criteria for an eligible recipient to receive a loan from
26 the Account.
