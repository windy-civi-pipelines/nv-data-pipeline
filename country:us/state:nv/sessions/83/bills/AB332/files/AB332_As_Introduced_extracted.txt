EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to industrial insurance; revising provisions
relating to certain administrators employed by an
association of self-insured employers; eliminating
assessments relating to a subsequent injury account;
prohibiting certain claims against a subsequent injury
account; repealing certain provisions relating to the
calculation of premium costs and certain audits; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law governs industrial insurers in this State that provide benefits to
2 employees who are injured in the course of employment. (Chapter 616B of NRS)
3 Existing law authorizes certain groups of public or private employers to act as an
4 association of self-insured employers if the group and each employer within the
5 group meet certain requirements. (NRS 616B.350-616B.446) Existing law requires
6 a board of trustees to operate any such association and to employ: (1) an
7 administrator of the association to carry out the policies of the board and perform
8 such duties as the board delegates; and (2) a third-party administrator to administer
9 the plan of insurance of the association. Existing law prohibits the administrator of
10 an association from performing any of the duties assigned to the third-party
11 administrator. (NRS 616B.365) Section 3 of this bill specifies that the administrator
12 of an association is prohibited from directly administering claims. Existing law also
13 prohibits the administrator of the association and the third-party administrator from
14 having a direct or indirect financial interest in each other. (NRS 616B.371) Section
15 4 of this bill removes the prohibition on the administrator of the association and the
16 third-party administrator having a financial interest in each other. Section 1 of this
17 bill revises a definition of the term “association’s administrator” to specify that the
18 responsibilities of the administrator of the association to carry out the daily
19 operations of the association are at the direction of the board of trustees.

20 Existing law requires a third-party administrator for an association of self-
21 insured employers to obtain a certificate as an administrator from the
22 Commissioner of Insurance and to file with the Commissioner a surety bond for
23 the benefit of any person damaged by any fraudulent act or conduct of the
24 administrator. (NRS 616B.503, 683A.08524, 683A.0857) Existing law also
25 requires the third-party administrator to file with the Commissioner an additional
26 surety bond conditioned upon the faithful performance of its duties relative to a
27 particular association of self-insured employers. Existing law requires the
28 administrator of the association to file a similar surety bond relative to the
29 association. (NRS 616B.353) Section 2 of this bill eliminates the requirement for
30 the third-party administrator to file an additional surety bond relative to its duties to
31 a particular association. Section 5 of this bill makes a conforming change to
32 remove the procedure for terminating liability on the bond eliminated by section 2.
33 Existing law establishes the Fund for Workers’ Compensation and Safety
34 within the State Treasury. (NRS 616A.425) Within the Fund, existing law creates a
35 Subsequent Injury Account for each of the following insurers: (1) self-insured
36 employers; (2) associations of self-insured public or private employers; and (3)
37 private carriers. (NRS 616B.554, 616B.575, 616B.584) Existing law requires that
38 money in the Accounts be used to provide compensation or reimbursement in
39 situations where an employee who has a preexisting permanent physical
40 impairment incurs a subsequent disability by injury arising out of and in the course
41 of employment which entitles the employee to compensation for the combined
42 disability that is substantially greater than that which would have resulted from the
43 subsequent injury alone. (NRS 616B.545-616B.590) Existing law requires a board
44 for administration or the Administrator of the Division of Industrial Relations of the
45 Department of Business and Industry to administer each Account. (NRS 616B.548,
46 616B.554, 616B.569, 616B.575, 616B.584) Existing law and regulations require
47 self-insured employers, associations of self-insured public or private employers and
48 private carriers to pay an annual assessment which funds the Accounts. (NRS
49 616B.554, 616B.575, 616B.584; chapter 616B of NAC)
50 Sections 6, 9 and 12 of this bill remove the authority to adopt regulations
51 which impose such assessments from each board for administration and the
52 Administrator of the Division, and section 16 of this bill voids the provisions of
53 existing regulations relating to such assessments, thus eliminating the requirement
54 for assessments to be paid for each Account. Sections 7, 8, 10, 11, 13 and 14 of
55 this bill require an employee to have incurred a subsequent injury and disability on
56 or before September 30, 2025, in order for the compensation or reimbursement
57 provisions to apply, thus prohibiting any claims against the Accounts due to a
58 subsequent injury and disability which is incurred on or after October 1, 2025.
59 For purposes of calculating the amount of a premium which is due pursuant to
60 the terms of a policy of industrial insurance, existing law provides that the
61 maximum amount paid to any one employee for services performed during the 12-
62 month period during which a policy is effective shall be deemed to be $36,000.
63 (NRS 616B.222) Existing law also deems as $36,000 to be the maximum amount
64 paid in a policy year to an officer or manager of a quasi-public or private
65 corporation or limited-liability company who receives pay for services performed
66 as an officer, manager or employee of the corporation or company. (NRS
67 616B.624) Sections 15 and 18 of this bill eliminate the $36,000 maximum amount
68 of pay for employees for purposes of calculating the amount of a premium which is
69 due pursuant to the terms of a policy of industrial insurance.
70 Existing law requires the Administrator of the Division, at least every 5 years,
71 to audit all insurers who provide benefits to injured employees, including
72 associations of self-insured employers. (NRS 616A.270, 616B.003) Existing law
73 also requires the Commissioner of Insurance, at least annually, to audit each
74 association of self-insured employers to verify certain information.

75 (NRS 616B.410) Section 18 repeals the requirement that the Commissioner
76 examine each association of self-insured employers annually.

22 616B.557 Except as otherwise provided in NRS 616B.560:
23 1. If an employee of a self-insured employer has a permanent
24 physical impairment from any cause or origin and incurs , on or
25 before September 30, 2025, a subsequent disability by injury arising
26 out of and in the course of his or her employment which entitles the
27 employee to compensation for disability that is substantially greater
28 by reason of the combined effects of the preexisting impairment and
29 the subsequent injury than that which would have resulted from the
30 subsequent injury alone, the compensation due must be charged to
31 the Subsequent Injury Account for Self-Insured Employers in
32 accordance with regulations adopted by the Board.
33 2. If the subsequent injury of such an employee incurred on or
34 before September 30, 2025, results in his or her death and it is
35 determined that the death would not have occurred except for the
36 preexisting permanent physical impairment, the compensation due
37 must be charged to the Subsequent Injury Account for Self-Insured
38 Employers in accordance with regulations adopted by the Board.
39 3. As used in this section, “permanent physical impairment”
40 means any permanent condition, whether congenital or caused by
41 injury or disease, of such seriousness as to constitute a hindrance or
42 obstacle to obtaining employment or to obtaining reemployment if
43 the employee is unemployed. For the purposes of this section, a
44 condition is not a “permanent physical impairment” unless it would
45 support a rating of permanent impairment of 6 percent or more of
-

6 Subsequent Injury Account for Self-Insured Employers, the self-

9 impairment” at the time the employee was hired or that the
10 employee was retained in employment after the self-insured
11 employer acquired such knowledge.
12 5. A self-insured employer must submit to the Board a claim
13 for reimbursement from the Subsequent Injury Account for Self-
14 Insured Employers.

16 for submitting claims against the Subsequent Injury Account for
17 Self-Insured Employers. The Board shall notify the self-insured
18 employer of its decision on such a claim within 120 days after the
19 claim is received.
20 7. An appeal of any decision made concerning a claim against
21 the Subsequent Injury Account for Self-Insured Employers must be
22 submitted directly to the district court.
23 Sec. 8. NRS 616B.560 is hereby amended to read as follows:
24 616B.560 1. A self-insured employer who pays
25 compensation due to an employee who has a permanent physical
26 impairment from any cause or origin and incurs , on or before
27 September 30, 2025, a subsequent disability by injury arising out of
28 and in the course of his or her employment which entitles the
29 employee to compensation for disability that is substantially greater
30 by reason of the combined effects of the preexisting impairment and
31 the subsequent injury than that which would have resulted from the
32 subsequent injury alone is entitled to be reimbursed from the
33 Subsequent Injury Account for Self-Insured Employers if:
34 (a) The employee knowingly made a false representation as to
35 his or her physical condition at the time the employee was hired by
36 the self-insured employer;
37 (b) The self-insured employer relied upon the false
38 representation and this reliance formed a substantial basis of the
39 employment; and
40 (c) A causal connection existed between the false representation
41 and the subsequent disability.
42  If the subsequent injury of the employee incurred on or before
43 September 30, 2025, results in his or her death and it is determined
44 that the death would not have occurred except for the preexisting
45 permanent physical impairment, any compensation paid is entitled
-

– 10 –
1 to be reimbursed from the Subsequent Injury Account for Self-
2 Insured Employers.
3 2. A self-insured employer shall notify the Board of any
4 possible claim against the Subsequent Injury Account for Self-
5 Insured Employers pursuant to this section no later than 60 days
6 after the date of the subsequent injury or the date the self-insured
7 employer learns of the employee’s false representation, whichever is
8 later.
9 Sec. 9. NRS 616B.575 is hereby amended to read as follows:
10 616B.575 1. There is hereby created in the Fund for
11 Workers’ Compensation and Safety in the State Treasury the

37 among the associations of self-insured public or private employers
38 and must be based upon expected annual expenditures for claims for
39 payments from the Subsequent Injury Account for Associations of
40 Self-Insured Public or Private Employers.]
41 7. [The Commissioner shall assign an actuary to review the
42 establishment of assessment rates. The rates must be filed with the
43 Commissioner 30 days before their effective date. Any association
44 of self-insured public or private employers that wishes to appeal the
45 rate so filed must do so pursuant to NRS 679B.310.

9 Sec. 10. NRS 616B.578 is hereby amended to read as follows:
10 616B.578 Except as otherwise provided in NRS 616B.581:
11 1. If an employee of a member of an association of self-insured
12 public or private employers has a permanent physical impairment
13 from any cause or origin and incurs , on or before September 30,
14 2025, a subsequent disability by injury arising out of and in the
15 course of his or her employment which entitles the employee to
16 compensation for disability that is substantially greater by reason of
17 the combined effects of the preexisting impairment and the
18 subsequent injury than that which would have resulted from the
19 subsequent injury alone, the compensation due must be charged to
20 the Subsequent Injury Account for Associations of Self-Insured
21 Public or Private Employers in accordance with regulations adopted
22 by the Board.
23 2. If the subsequent injury of such an employee incurred on or
24 before September 30, 2025, results in his or her death and it is
25 determined that the death would not have occurred except for the
26 preexisting permanent physical impairment, the compensation due
27 must be charged to the Subsequent Injury Account for Associations
28 of Self-Insured Public or Private Employers in accordance with
29 regulations adopted by the Board.
30 3. As used in this section, “permanent physical impairment”

32 injury or disease, of such seriousness as to constitute a hindrance or
33 obstacle to obtaining employment or to obtaining reemployment if
34 the employee is unemployed. For the purposes of this section, a
35 condition is not a “permanent physical impairment” unless it would
36 support a rating of permanent impairment of 6 percent or more of
37 the whole person if evaluated according to the American Medical
38 Association’s Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment as
39 adopted and supplemented by the Division pursuant to
40 NRS 616C.110.

42 Subsequent Injury Account for Associations of Self-Insured Public
43 or Private Employers, the association of self-insured public or
44 private employers must establish by written records that the
45 employer had knowledge of the “permanent physical impairment” at

4 must submit to the Board a claim for reimbursement from the
5 Subsequent Injury Account for Associations of Self-Insured Public
6 or Private Employers.
7 6. The Board shall adopt regulations establishing procedures
8 for submitting claims against the Subsequent Injury Account for
9 Associations of Self-Insured Public or Private Employers. The
10 Board shall notify the Association of Self-Insured Public or Private
11 Employers of its decision on such a claim within 120 days after the
12 claim is received.
13 7. An appeal of any decision made concerning a claim against
14 the Subsequent Injury Account for Associations of Self-Insured
15 Public or Private Employers must be submitted directly to the
16 district court.
17 Sec. 11. NRS 616B.581 is hereby amended to read as follows:
18 616B.581 1. An association of self-insured public or private
19 employers that pays compensation due to an employee who has a
20 permanent physical impairment from any cause or origin and incurs
21 , on or before September 30, 2025, a subsequent disability by injury
22 arising out of and in the course of his or her employment which
23 entitles the employee to compensation for disability that is
24 substantially greater by reason of the combined effects of the
25 preexisting impairment and the subsequent injury than that which
26 would have resulted from the subsequent injury alone is entitled to
27 be reimbursed from the Subsequent Injury Account for Associations
28 of Self-Insured Public or Private Employers if:
29 (a) The employee knowingly made a false representation as to
30 his or her physical condition at the time the employee was hired by
31 the member of the Association of Self-Insured Public or Private
32 Employers;
33 (b) The employer relied upon the false representation and this
34 reliance formed a substantial basis of the employment; and
35 (c) A causal connection existed between the false representation
36 and the subsequent disability.
37  If the subsequent injury of the employee incurred on or before
38 September 30, 2025, results in his or her death and it is determined
39 that the death would not have occurred except for the preexisting
40 permanent physical impairment, any compensation paid is entitled
41 to be reimbursed from the Subsequent Injury Account for
42 Associations of Self-Insured Public or Private Employers.
43 2. An association of self-insured public or private employers
44 shall notify the Board of any possible claim against the Subsequent
45 Injury Account for Associations of Self-Insured Public or Private

29 the employments covered by private carriers, must result in an
30 equitable distribution of costs among the private carriers and must
31 be based upon expected annual premiums to be received.
32 7. The Commissioner shall assign an actuary to review the
33 establishment of assessment rates. The rates must be filed with the

9 must be charged to the Subsequent Injury Account for Private
10 Carriers in accordance with regulations adopted by the
11 Administrator.
12 3. As used in this section, “permanent physical impairment”
13 means any permanent condition, whether congenital or caused by
14 injury or disease, of such seriousness as to constitute a hindrance or
15 obstacle to obtaining employment or to obtaining reemployment if
16 the employee is unemployed. For the purposes of this section, a
17 condition is not a “permanent physical impairment” unless it would
18 support a rating of permanent impairment of 6 percent or more of
19 the whole person if evaluated according to the American Medical
20 Association’s Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment as

26 Sec. 15. NRS 616B.624 is hereby amended to read as follows:

A.B. 332
ASSEMBLY BILL NO. 332–ASSEMBLYMEMBER O’NEILL
MARCH 3, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Commerce and Labor
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to industrial insurance.
(BDR 53-325)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to industrial insurance; revising provisions
relating to certain administrators employed by an
association of self-insured employers; eliminating
assessments relating to a subsequent injury account;
prohibiting certain claims against a subsequent injury
account; repealing certain provisions relating to the
calculation of premium costs and certain audits; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law governs industrial insurers in this State that provide benefits to
2 employees who are injured in the course of employment. (Chapter 616B of NRS)
3 Existing law authorizes certain groups of public or private employers to act as an
4 association of self-insured employers if the group and each employer within the
5 group meet certain requirements. (NRS 616B.350-616B.446) Existing law requires
6 a board of trustees to operate any such association and to employ: (1) an
7 administrator of the association to carry out the policies of the board and perform
8 such duties as the board delegates; and (2) a third-party administrator to administer
9 the plan of insurance of the association. Existing law prohibits the administrator of
10 an association from performing any of the duties assigned to the third-party
11 administrator. (NRS 616B.365) Section 3 of this bill specifies that the administrator
12 of an association is prohibited from directly administering claims. Existing law also
13 prohibits the administrator of the association and the third-party administrator from
14 having a direct or indirect financial interest in each other. (NRS 616B.371) Section
15 4 of this bill removes the prohibition on the administrator of the association and the
16 third-party administrator having a financial interest in each other. Section 1 of this
17 bill revises a definition of the term “association’s administrator” to specify that the
18 responsibilities of the administrator of the association to carry out the daily
19 operations of the association are at the direction of the board of trustees.

20 Existing law requires a third-party administrator for an association of self-
21 insured employers to obtain a certificate as an administrator from the
22 Commissioner of Insurance and to file with the Commissioner a surety bond for
23 the benefit of any person damaged by any fraudulent act or conduct of the
24 administrator. (NRS 616B.503, 683A.08524, 683A.0857) Existing law also
25 requires the third-party administrator to file with the Commissioner an additional
26 surety bond conditioned upon the faithful performance of its duties relative to a
27 particular association of self-insured employers. Existing law requires the
28 administrator of the association to file a similar surety bond relative to the
29 association. (NRS 616B.353) Section 2 of this bill eliminates the requirement for
30 the third-party administrator to file an additional surety bond relative to its duties to
31 a particular association. Section 5 of this bill makes a conforming change to
32 remove the procedure for terminating liability on the bond eliminated by section 2.
33 Existing law establishes the Fund for Workers’ Compensation and Safety
34 within the State Treasury. (NRS 616A.425) Within the Fund, existing law creates a
35 Subsequent Injury Account for each of the following insurers: (1) self-insured
36 employers; (2) associations of self-insured public or private employers; and (3)
37 private carriers. (NRS 616B.554, 616B.575, 616B.584) Existing law requires that
38 money in the Accounts be used to provide compensation or reimbursement in
39 situations where an employee who has a preexisting permanent physical
40 impairment incurs a subsequent disability by injury arising out of and in the course
41 of employment which entitles the employee to compensation for the combined
42 disability that is substantially greater than that which would have resulted from the
43 subsequent injury alone. (NRS 616B.545-616B.590) Existing law requires a board
44 for administration or the Administrator of the Division of Industrial Relations of the
45 Department of Business and Industry to administer each Account. (NRS 616B.548,
46 616B.554, 616B.569, 616B.575, 616B.584) Existing law and regulations require
47 self-insured employers, associations of self-insured public or private employers and
48 private carriers to pay an annual assessment which funds the Accounts. (NRS
49 616B.554, 616B.575, 616B.584; chapter 616B of NAC)
50 Sections 6, 9 and 12 of this bill remove the authority to adopt regulations
51 which impose such assessments from each board for administration and the
52 Administrator of the Division, and section 16 of this bill voids the provisions of
53 existing regulations relating to such assessments, thus eliminating the requirement
54 for assessments to be paid for each Account. Sections 7, 8, 10, 11, 13 and 14 of
55 this bill require an employee to have incurred a subsequent injury and disability on
56 or before September 30, 2025, in order for the compensation or reimbursement
57 provisions to apply, thus prohibiting any claims against the Accounts due to a
58 subsequent injury and disability which is incurred on or after October 1, 2025.
59 For purposes of calculating the amount of a premium which is due pursuant to
60 the terms of a policy of industrial insurance, existing law provides that the
61 maximum amount paid to any one employee for services performed during the 12-
62 month period during which a policy is effective shall be deemed to be $36,000.
63 (NRS 616B.222) Existing law also deems as $36,000 to be the maximum amount
64 paid in a policy year to an officer or manager of a quasi-public or private
65 corporation or limited-liability company who receives pay for services performed
66 as an officer, manager or employee of the corporation or company. (NRS
67 616B.624) Sections 15 and 18 of this bill eliminate the $36,000 maximum amount
68 of pay for employees for purposes of calculating the amount of a premium which is
69 due pursuant to the terms of a policy of industrial insurance.
70 Existing law requires the Administrator of the Division, at least every 5 years,
71 to audit all insurers who provide benefits to injured employees, including
72 associations of self-insured employers. (NRS 616A.270, 616B.003) Existing law
73 also requires the Commissioner of Insurance, at least annually, to audit each
74 association of self-insured employers to verify certain information.

75 (NRS 616B.410) Section 18 repeals the requirement that the Commissioner
76 examine each association of self-insured employers annually.

26 out of and in the course of his or her employment which entitles the
27 employee to compensation for disability that is substantially greater
28 by reason of the combined effects of the preexisting impairment and
29 the subsequent injury than that which would have resulted from the
30 subsequent injury alone, the compensation due must be charged to
31 the Subsequent Injury Account for Self-Insured Employers in
32 accordance with regulations adopted by the Board.
33 2. If the subsequent injury of such an employee incurred on or

29 employee to compensation for disability that is substantially greater
30 by reason of the combined effects of the preexisting impairment and
31 the subsequent injury than that which would have resulted from the
32 subsequent injury alone is entitled to be reimbursed from the

38 representation and this reliance formed a substantial basis of the
39 employment; and

41 and the subsequent disability.
42  If the subsequent injury of the employee incurred on or before
43 September 30, 2025, results in his or her death and it is determined

7 employer learns of the employee’s false representation, whichever is
8 later.

4 Sec. 12. NRS 616B.584 is hereby amended to read as follows:
5 616B.584 1. There is hereby created in the Fund for

10 Account.
11 2. All [assessments,] penalties, bonds, securities and all other
12 properties received, collected or acquired by the Administrator for
13 the Subsequent Injury Account for Private Carriers must be
14 delivered to the custody of the State Treasurer.
15 3. All money and securities in the Account must be held by the
16 State Treasurer as custodian thereof to be used solely for workers’
17 compensation for employees whose employers are insured by
18 private carriers.
19 4. The State Treasurer may disburse money from the Account
20 only upon written order of the State Controller.
21 5. The State Treasurer shall invest money of the Account in the
22 same manner and in the same securities in which the State Treasurer
23 is authorized to invest State General Funds which are in the custody

25 assets of the Account must be credited to the Account.
26 6. The Administrator shall adopt regulations for the
27 establishment and administration of [assessment rates,] payments
28 and penalties. [Assessment rates must reflect the relative hazard of
29 the employments covered by private carriers, must result in an

31 be based upon expected annual premiums to be received.
32 7. The Commissioner shall assign an actuary to review the
33 establishment of assessment rates. The rates must be filed with the
34 Commissioner 30 days before their effective date. Any private
35 carrier who wishes to appeal the rate so filed must do so pursuant to
36 NRS 679B.310.]
37 Sec. 13. NRS 616B.587 is hereby amended to read as follows:
38 616B.587 Except as otherwise provided in NRS 616B.590:
39 1. If an employee of an employer who is insured by a private
40 carrier has a permanent physical impairment from any cause or
41 origin and incurs , on or before September 30, 2025, a subsequent
42 disability by injury arising out of and in the course of his or her
43 employment which entitles the employee to compensation for
44 disability that is substantially greater by reason of the combined
45 effects of the preexisting impairment and the subsequent injury than
-
*AB332*

– 14 –
1 that which would have resulted from the subsequent injury alone,
2 the compensation due must be charged to the Subsequent Injury
3 Account for Private Carriers in accordance with regulations adopted
4 by the Administrator.
5 2. If the subsequent injury of such an employee incurred on or
6 before September 30, 2025, results in his or her death and it is

8 preexisting permanent physical impairment, the compensation due
9 must be charged to the Subsequent Injury Account for Private
10 Carriers in accordance with regulations adopted by the
11 Administrator.
12 3. As used in this section, “permanent physical impairment”
13 means any permanent condition, whether congenital or caused by
14 injury or disease, of such seriousness as to constitute a hindrance or
15 obstacle to obtaining employment or to obtaining reemployment if
16 the employee is unemployed. For the purposes of this section, a
17 condition is not a “permanent physical impairment” unless it would
18 support a rating of permanent impairment of 6 percent or more of
19 the whole person if evaluated according to the American Medical
20 Association’s Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment as
21 adopted and supplemented by the Division pursuant to
22 NRS 616C.110.

33 procedures for submitting claims against the Subsequent Injury
34 Account for Private Carriers. The Administrator shall notify the
35 private carrier of his or her decision on such a claim within 120 days
36 after the claim is received.
37 7. An appeal of any decision made concerning a claim against
38 the Subsequent Injury Account for Private Carriers must be
39 submitted directly to the appeals officer. The appeals officer shall
40 hear such an appeal within 45 days after the appeal is submitted to
41 the appeals officer.
42 Sec. 14. NRS 616B.590 is hereby amended to read as follows:
43 616B.590 1. A private carrier who pays compensation due to
44 an employee who has a permanent physical impairment from any
45 cause or origin and incurs , on or before September 30, 2025, a
-
*AB332*

– 15 –
1 subsequent disability by injury arising out of and in the course of his
2 or her employment which entitles the employee to compensation for
3 disability that is substantially greater by reason of the combined
4 effects of the preexisting impairment and the subsequent injury than
5 that which would have resulted from the subsequent injury alone is
6 entitled to be reimbursed from the Subsequent Injury Account for
7 Private Carriers if:
8 (a) The employee knowingly made a false representation as to
9 his or her physical condition at the time the employee was hired by
10 the employer insured by a private carrier;
11 (b) The employer relied upon the false representation and this
12 reliance formed a substantial basis of the employment; and
13 (c) A causal connection existed between the false representation
14 and the subsequent disability.
15  If the subsequent injury of the employee incurred on or before
16 September 30, 2025, results in his or her death and it is determined
17 that the death would not have occurred except for the preexisting
18 permanent physical impairment, any compensation paid is entitled
19 to be reimbursed from the Subsequent Injury Account for Private
20 Carriers.
21 2. A private carrier shall notify the Administrator of any
22 possible claim against the Subsequent Injury Account for Private
23 Carriers pursuant to this section no later than 60 days after the date
24 of the subsequent injury or the date the employer learns of the
25 employee’s false representation, whichever is later.
26 Sec. 15. NRS 616B.624 is hereby amended to read as follows:
27 616B.624 1. If a quasi-public or private corporation or a
28 limited-liability company is required to be insured pursuant to
29 chapters 616A to 616D, inclusive, of NRS, an officer of the
30 corporation or a manager of the company who:

8 4. An officer or manager who has rejected coverage may
9 rescind that rejection by filing written notice thereof with the
10 corporation or company and the insurer. The rescission is effective
11 upon receipt of the notice by the insurer. Except as otherwise
12 provided in subsection 3, if an officer or manager who has rejected
13 coverage receives pay for services performed as an officer, manager
14 or employee of the corporation or company, the officer or manager
15 shall be deemed to have rescinded that rejection.
16 5. A nonprofit corporation whose officers do not receive pay
17 for services performed as officers or employees of the corporation
18 may elect to reject coverage for its current officers and all future
19 officers who do not receive such pay by filing written notice thereof
20 with the corporation and the insurer. The rejection is effective upon
21 receipt of the notice by the insurer.
22 6. A nonprofit corporation which has rejected coverage for its
23 officers who do not receive pay for services performed as officers or
24 employees of the corporation may rescind that rejection by filing
25 written notice thereof with the corporation and the insurer. The
26 rescission is effective upon receipt of the notice by the insurer. If an
27 officer of a nonprofit corporation which has rejected coverage
28 receives pay for services performed as an officer or employee of the
29 corporation, the corporation shall be deemed to have rescinded that
30 rejection.
