Senate Bill No. 19–Committee on Natural Resources
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to interstate fire compacts; ratifying the Great
Plains Wildland Fire Protection Compact upon a declaration
by the Governor; ratifying the Northwest Wildland Fire
Protection Agreement upon a declaration by the Governor;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
In 2007, the United States Congress approved the Great Plains Wildland Fire
Protection Compact. The Compact: (1) authorizes the state forester or officer
holding the equivalent position who is responsible for forest fire control to consult
with like officials of other member states and implement cooperation between the
states in forest fire prevention and control; (2) authorizes member states to provide
reciprocal aid in fighting forest fires among the compacting states if the state forest
fire control agency of a member state requests aid; (3) provides that the fire fighting
forces of any member state that renders outside aid at the request of another
member state have, with certain exceptions, the same powers, duties, rights,
privileges and immunities as comparable employees of the state to which they are
rendering aid; (4) provides that a member state is not liable for any act or omission
of its fire fighting forces made in connection with rendering outside aid to a
member state; (5) provides that any liability that may arise is assumed by the
member state that requests aid; (6) requires a member state that receives aid from
another member state to reimburse the member state that provided the aid; (7)
requires each member state to maintain adequate forest fire fighting forces and
equipment to meet the demands for forest fire protection within its borders; and (8)
provides that the Compact is effective and binding on each state ratifying it until
the legislature or the governor of the state takes action to withdraw from the
Compact. (Pub. L. No. 110-79) Section 2 of this bill ratifies the Compact. Section
4 of this bill requires the Governor to notify the member states of the Compact that
Nevada has ratified the Compact. Section 5 of this bill makes the ratification of the
Compact effective on the date on which the Governor of this State declares that this
State has ratified the Compact and the State’s entry has been approved.
In 1998, the United States Congress approved the Northwest Wildland Fire
Protection Agreement. The Agreement: (1) provides that the role of the members is
to coordinate the plans and work of the appropriate agencies and to coordinate the
rendering of aid to members in fighting wildland fires; (2) provides that the
members agree to render aid when any other member requests aid in controlling or
preventing wildland fires; (3) requires the employees of any member providing aid
to operate under the direction of the officers of the member to whom the aid is
rendered; (4) provides that the employees of any members providing aid have the
same privileges and immunities as comparable employees of the member to whom
they are rendering aid; (5) provides that a member is not liable for any act or
omission of its fire fighting forces made in connection with rendering aid to a
member; (6) requires a member that receives aid from another member to
reimburse the member that provided the aid; (7) requires each member to keep
accurate books of account showing receipts and disbursements which are open to
inspection of representatives of a member; (8) requires the members to hold an
annual meeting to review the terms of the Agreement and any applicable operating
plans; and (9) provides that the Agreement is effective on each member until such
member takes action to withdraw from the Agreement. (Pub. L. No. 105-377)

conditions, the Members agree:
ARTICLE I
The purpose of this compact is to promote effective prevention
and control of forest fires in the Great Plains region of the United

officials of the other member states and may implement
cooperation between the states in forest fire prevention and
control. The compact administrators of the member states may
organize to coordinate the services of the member states and
provide administrative integration in carrying out the purposes of
this compact. Each member state may formulate and put in effect
a forest fire plan for that state.
ARTICLE IV
If the state forest fire control agency of a member state requests
aid from the state forest fire control agency of any other member
state in combating, controlling, or preventing forest fires, the state
forest fire control agency of that state may render all possible aid
to the requesting agency, consonant with the maintenance of
protection at home.
ARTICLE V
If the forces of any member state are rendering outside aid

compact, the employees of the state shall, under the direction of
the officers of the state to which they are rendering aid, have the
same powers (except the power of arrest), duties, rights, privileges,

No member state or its officers or employees rendering outside
aid pursuant to this compact is liable on account of any act or
omission on the part of such forces while so engaged, or on
account of the maintenance or use of any equipment or supplies in
connection with rendering the outside aid.
All liability, except as otherwise provided in this compact, that
may arise either under the laws of the requesting state or under
the laws of the aiding state or under the laws of a third state on
account of or in connection with a request for aid, shall be
assumed and borne by the requesting state.

Any member state rendering outside aid pursuant to this
compact shall be reimbursed by the member state receiving the aid
for any loss or damage to, or expense incurred in the operation of
any equipment answering a request for aid, and for the cost of all
materials, transportation, wages, salaries, and maintenance of
employees and equipment incurred in connection with such
request. However, nothing in this compact prevents any assisting
member state from assuming such loss, damage, expense or other
cost or from loaning such equipment or from donating such
services to the receiving member state without charge or cost.
Each member state shall assure that workers compensation
benefits in conformity with the minimum legal requirements of the
state are available to all employees and contract firefighters sent to
a requesting state pursuant to this compact.
For the purposes of this compact the term, employee, includes

fighting forces of the aiding state under the laws of the aiding
state.
The compact administrators may formulate procedures for
claims and reimbursement under the provisions of this article, in
accordance with the laws of the member states.
ARTICLE VI
Ratification of this compact does not affect any existing statute
so as to authorize or permit curtailment or diminution of the forest
fighting forces, equipment, services, or facilities of any member
state.
Nothing in the compact authorizes or permits any member state
to curtail or diminish its forest fire fighting forces, equipment,
services, or facilities. Each member state shall maintain adequate
forest fire fighting forces and equipment to meet demands for
forest fire protection within its borders in the same manner and to
the same extent as if this compact were not operative.
Nothing in this compact limits or restricts the powers of any
state ratifying the compact to provide for the prevention, control,
and extinguishment of forest fires, or to prohibit the enactment or
enforcement of state laws, rules, or regulations intended to aid in
the prevention, control, and extinguishment in the state.
Nothing in this compact affects any existing or future
cooperative relationship or arrangement between the United States
Forest Service and a member state or states.
