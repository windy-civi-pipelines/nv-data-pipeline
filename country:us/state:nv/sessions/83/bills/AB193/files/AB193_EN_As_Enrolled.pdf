CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to victims of crime; requiring a law enforcement
agency to furnish a free copy of all reports of the law
enforcement agency concerning an act that constitutes
domestic violence under certain circumstances; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law requires a law enforcement agency to furnish a free, complete and
unaltered copy of all reports of the law enforcement agency concerning a sexual
assault upon written request by the survivor of the sexual assault. Under existing
law, a law enforcement agency: (1) must furnish any such report within 1 month
after receiving a written request by a survivor; and (2) may, as appropriate, redact
personal identifying information from any such report. (NRS 178A.280) This bill:
(1) imposes a similar requirement on a law enforcement agency that receives a
written request from a victim of domestic violence; and (2) authorizes the law
enforcement agency to redact personal identifying information under similar
circumstances.
