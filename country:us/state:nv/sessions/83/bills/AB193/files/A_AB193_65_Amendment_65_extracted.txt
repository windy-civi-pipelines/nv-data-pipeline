AN ACT relating to victims of crime; requiring a law enforcement agency to
furnish a free copy of all reports of the law enforcement agency
concerning an act that constitutes domestic violence under certain
circumstances; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires a law enforcement agency to furnish a free, complete and unaltered
2 copy of all reports of the law enforcement agency concerning a sexual assault upon written
3 request by the survivor of the sexual assault. Under existing law, a law enforcement agency:
4 (1) must furnish any such report within 1 month after receiving a written request by a
5 survivor; and (2) may, as appropriate, redact personal identifying information from any such
6 report. (NRS 178A.280) This bill: (1) imposes a similar requirement on a law enforcement
7 agency that receives a written request from a victim of domestic violence; and (2) authorizes
8 the law enforcement agency to redact personal identifying information under similar
9 circumstances.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 217 of NRS is hereby amended by adding thereto a new
2 section to read as follows:
3 1. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, a law enforcement
4 agency shall, upon written request by a victim of domestic violence, furnish
5 within 1 month, free, complete and unaltered copies of all reports of the law
6 enforcement agency concerning the domestic violence, regardless of whether the
7 report has been closed by the law enforcement agency. A law enforcement agency
8 may, as appropriate, redact personal identifying information from any reports
9 provided pursuant to this subsection.
10 2. As used in this section:

2 State or a political subdivision of this State, the primary duty of which is to
