Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires a law enforcement agency to furnish a free, complete and
2 unaltered copy of all reports of the law enforcement agency concerning a sexual

5 after receiving a written request by a survivor; and (2) may, as appropriate, redact
6 personal identifying information from any such report. (NRS 178A.280) This bill:
7 (1) imposes a similar requirement on a law enforcement agency that receives a
8 written request from a victim of domestic violence; and (2) authorizes the law
9 enforcement agency to redact personal identifying information under similar
10 circumstances.

SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 217 of NRS is hereby amended by adding
