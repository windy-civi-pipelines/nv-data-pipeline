vacancy in the City Council or in the office of Mayor or Municipal Judge for the
remainder of the unexpired term by: (1) appointment within 60 days after the
occurrence of the vacancy; or (2) a special election called by resolution of the City
Council to be held not later than 90 days after the vacancy occurs. (Henderson City
Charter § 1.070) Section 1 of this bill requires the City Council to adopt such a
resolution within 60 days after the occurrence of the vacancy and to specify the
date of the special election in the resolution. Section 1 further provides that if the
City Council calls a special election to fill the vacancy, the special election must be
held not later than 90 days after the date on which the City Council adopts the
resolution, but no such special election may be held during the period starting on
the date immediately following a municipal primary election and ending 120 days
after the date of a municipal general election.
The existing Charter of the City of Henderson requires: (1) a proposed
ordinance to be read to the City Council by title, referred to a committee for
consideration and filed with the City Clerk for public distribution; (2) notice of the
filing to be published once in a qualified newspaper at least 10 days before the

the City Council at the next regular or special meeting of the City Council, after

postponed; and (4) the City Council to adopt or reject the ordinance or any
amendment thereto within 30 days after the publication. (Henderson City Charter §

Section 2:

referred to a committee, section 2 requires the committee to consider the ordinance
and report its recommendations back to the City Council at a regular meeting or
special meeting of the City Council following the proposal and reference of the
ordinance. If a proposed ordinance is not referred to a committee, section 2 requires
the City Council to consider the ordinance in substantially the same form as
proposed. Finally, section 2 provides that regardless of whether a proposed
ordinance is referred to a committee, at a regular or special meeting of the City
Council, the title of the proposed ordinance must be read and the City Council must
vote to adopt, revise or postpone consideration of the proposed ordinance.
The existing Charter of the City of Henderson: (1) authorizes the City Council
to sell unimproved real property owned by the City on a time payment basis; and
(2) requires that when the City Council disposes of real property to certain entities,
the consideration paid must equal the cost of the acquisition to the City. (Henderson
City Charter § 2.320) Section 3 of this bill authorizes the City Council to instead
sell any real property owned by the City on a time payment basis. Section 3 also:
(1) removes the requirement that the consideration paid for the disposal of real
property to certain entities must equal the cost of the acquisition to the City; and (2)
