Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 The existing Charter of the City of Henderson requires the City Council to fill a vacancy
2 in the City Council or in the office of Mayor or Municipal Judge for the remainder of the
3 unexpired term by: (1) appointment within 60 days after the occurrence of the vacancy; or (2)
4 a special election called by resolution of the City Council to be held not later than 90 days
5 after the vacancy occurs. (Henderson City Charter § 1.070) Section 1 of this bill requires the
6 City Council to adopt such a resolution within 60 days after the occurrence of the vacancy and
7 to specify the date of the special election in the resolution. Section 1 further provides that if
8 the City Council calls a special election to fill the vacancy, the special election must be held
9 not later than 90 days after the date on which the City Council adopts the resolution, but no
10 such special election may be held during the period starting on the date immediately following
11 a municipal primary election and ending 120 days after the date of a municipal general
12 election.
13 The existing Charter of the City of Henderson requires: (1) a proposed ordinance to be
14 read to the City Council by title, referred to a committee for consideration and filed with the
15 City Clerk for public distribution; (2) notice of the filing to be published once in a qualified
16 newspaper at least 10 days before the adoption of the ordinance; (3) the committee to report
17 the ordinance back to the City Council at the next regular or special meeting of the City
18 Council, after which the proposed ordinance must be finally voted upon or action thereon
19 postponed; and (4) the City Council to adopt or reject the ordinance or any amendment thereto
20 within 30 days after the publication. (Henderson City Charter § 2.100) Section 2 of this bill
21 authorizes instead of requires the City Council to refer a proposed ordinance to a committee
22 for consideration. If a proposed ordinance is referred to a committee, section 2 requires the
23 committee to consider the ordinance and report its recommendations back to the City Council
24 at a regular meeting or special meeting of the City Council following the proposal and
25 reference of the ordinance. If a proposed ordinance is not referred to a committee, section 2
26 requires the City Council to consider the ordinance in substantially the same form as

Senate Amendment No. 490 to Senate Bill No. 72 Page 4
27 proposed. Finally, section 2 provides that regardless of whether a proposed ordinance is
28 referred to a committee, at a regular or special meeting of the City Council, the title of the
29 proposed ordinance must be read and the City Council must vote to adopt, revise or postpone
30 consideration of the proposed ordinance.
31 The existing Charter of the City of Henderson: (1) authorizes the City Council to sell
32 unimproved real property owned by the City on a time payment basis; and (2) requires that
33 when the City Council disposes of real property to certain entities, the consideration paid must
34 equal the cost of the acquisition to the City. (Henderson City Charter § 2.320) Section 3 of
35 this bill authorizes the City Council to instead sell any real property owned by the City on a
36 time payment basis. Section 3 also : (1) removes the requirement that the consideration paid
37 for the disposal of real property to certain entities must equal the cost of the acquisition to the
38 City [.] ; and (2) provides that such disposals of real property are subject to certain
39 provisions of the Nevada Revised Statutes governing municipal property to the extent
40 such provisions are applicable.
