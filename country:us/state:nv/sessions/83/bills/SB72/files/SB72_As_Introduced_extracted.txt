AN ACT relating to the City of Henderson; revising provisions
governing the filling of a vacancy for certain municipal
elective offices; revising the procedure for enacting
ordinances; revising provisions governing the sale and
disposition of real property; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 The existing Charter of the City of Henderson requires the City Council to fill a
2 vacancy in the City Council or in the office of Mayor or Municipal Judge for the
3 remainder of the unexpired term by: (1) appointment within 60 days after the
4 occurrence of the vacancy; or (2) a special election called by resolution of the City
5 Council to be held not later than 90 days after the vacancy occurs. (Henderson City
6 Charter § 1.070) Section 1 of this bill requires the City Council to adopt such a
7 resolution within 60 days after the occurrence of the vacancy and to specify the
8 date of the special election in the resolution. Section 1 further provides that if the
9 City Council calls a special election to fill the vacancy, the special election must be
10 held not later than 90 days after the date on which the City Council adopts the
11 resolution, but no such special election may be held during the period starting on
12 the date immediately following a municipal primary election and ending 120 days
13 after the date of a municipal general election.
14 The existing Charter of the City of Henderson requires: (1) a proposed
15 ordinance to be read to the City Council by title, referred to a committee for
16 consideration and filed with the City Clerk for public distribution; (2) notice of the
17 filing to be published once in a qualified newspaper at least 10 days before the
18 adoption of the ordinance; (3) the committee to report the ordinance back to
19 the City Council at the next regular or special meeting of the City Council, after

– 2 –
20 which the proposed ordinance must be finally voted upon or action thereon
21 postponed; and (4) the City Council to adopt or reject the ordinance or any
22 amendment thereto within 30 days after the publication. (Henderson City Charter §
23 2.100) Section 2 of this bill authorizes instead of requires the City Council to refer
24 a proposed ordinance to a committee for consideration. If a proposed ordinance is
25 referred to a committee, section 2 requires the committee to consider the ordinance
26 and report its recommendations back to the City Council at a regular meeting or
27 special meeting of the City Council following the proposal and reference of the
28 ordinance. If a proposed ordinance is not referred to a committee, section 2 requires
29 the City Council to consider the ordinance in substantially the same form as
30 proposed. Finally, section 2 provides that regardless of whether a proposed
31 ordinance is referred to a committee, at a regular or special meeting of the City
32 Council, the title of the proposed ordinance must be read and the City Council must
33 vote to adopt, revise or postpone consideration of the proposed ordinance.
34 The existing Charter of the City of Henderson: (1) authorizes the City Council
35 to sell unimproved real property owned by the City on a time payment basis; and
36 (2) requires that when the City Council disposes of real property to certain entities,
37 the consideration paid must equal the cost of the acquisition to the City. (Henderson
38 City Charter § 2.320) Section 3 of this bill authorizes the City Council to instead
39 sell any real property owned by the City on a time payment basis. Section 3 also
40 removes the requirement that the consideration paid for the disposal of real
41 property to certain entities must equal the cost of the acquisition to the City.

3 remainder of the unexpired term by: (1) appointment within 60 days after the
4 occurrence of the vacancy; or (2) a special election called by resolution of the City
5 Council to be held not later than 90 days after the vacancy occurs. (Henderson City
6 Charter § 1.070) Section 1 of this bill requires the City Council to adopt such a
7 resolution within 60 days after the occurrence of the vacancy and to specify the
8 date of the special election in the resolution. Section 1 further provides that if the
9 City Council calls a special election to fill the vacancy, the special election must be
10 held not later than 90 days after the date on which the City Council adopts the
11 resolution, but no such special election may be held during the period starting on
12 the date immediately following a municipal primary election and ending 120 days
13 after the date of a municipal general election.
14 The existing Charter of the City of Henderson requires: (1) a proposed
15 ordinance to be read to the City Council by title, referred to a committee for

21 postponed; and (4) the City Council to adopt or reject the ordinance or any

35 to sell unimproved real property owned by the City on a time payment basis; and
