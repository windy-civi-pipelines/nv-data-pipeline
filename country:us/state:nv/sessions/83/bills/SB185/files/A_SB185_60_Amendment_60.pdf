EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; requiring [reimbursement under] Medicaid to
[family members who provide] cover personal care services provided
to certain recipients of Medicaid; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires Medicaid to cover certain home and community-based services for
2 persons with physical disabilities, including personal care services in the home. (NRS
3 422.272407, 422.396) Section 1 of this bill requires [the Department of Health and Human
4 Services to reimburse a member of the family of] Medicaid to cover personal care services
5 provided to a recipient of Medicaid [for providing personal care services to the recipient, so
6 long as the recipient:] who: (1) is less than 18 years of age; [(2) is eligible under Medicaid to
7 receive coverage for personal care services;] and [(3)] (2) has been diagnosed with a disability
8 or chronic illness that renders the recipient unable to perform activities of daily living without
9 assistance. Section 1 requires such coverage to be available for personal care services
10 provided by a member of the family of the recipient of Medicaid if the family member
11 meets the requirements for providers of personal care services generally to receive
12 reimbursement through Medicaid.
13 Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to require the Director of the
14 Department of Health and Human Services to administer the provisions of section 1 in the
15 same manner as other provisions relating to Medicaid.
