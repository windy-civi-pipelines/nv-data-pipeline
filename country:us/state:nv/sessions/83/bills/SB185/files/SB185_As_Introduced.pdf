AN ACT relating to health care; requiring reimbursement under
Medicaid to family members who provide personal care

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires Medicaid to cover certain home and community-based
2 services for persons with physical disabilities, including personal care services in
3 the home. (NRS 422.272407, 422.396) Section 1 of this bill requires the
4 Department of Health and Human Services to reimburse a member of the family of
5 a recipient of Medicaid for providing personal care services to the recipient, so long
6 as the recipient: (1) is less than 18 years of age; (2) is eligible under Medicaid to
7 receive coverage for personal care services; and (3) has been diagnosed with a
8 disability or chronic illness that renders the recipient unable to perform activities of
9 daily living without assistance.
10 Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to require the Director of the
11 Department to administer the provisions of section 1 in the same manner as other
12 provisions relating to Medicaid.
