EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; requiring Medicaid to cover
personal care services provided to certain recipients of
Medicaid; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires Medicaid to cover certain home and community-based
2 services for persons with physical disabilities, including personal care services in
3 the home. (NRS 422.272407, 422.396) Section 1 of this bill requires Medicaid to
4 cover personal care services provided to a recipient of Medicaid who: (1) is less
5 than 18 years of age; and (2) has been diagnosed with a disability or chronic illness
6 that renders the recipient unable to perform activities of daily living without
7 assistance. Section 1 requires such coverage to be available for personal care
8 services provided by a member of the family of the recipient of Medicaid if the
9 family member meets the requirements for providers of personal care services
10 generally to receive reimbursement through Medicaid.
11 Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to require the Director of the
12 Department of Health and Human Services to administer the provisions of section
13 1 in the same manner as other provisions relating to Medicaid.

1 Section 1. Chapter 422 of NRS is hereby amended by adding
2 thereto a new section to read as follows:
