EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; requiring reimbursement under
Medicaid to family members who provide personal care
services to certain recipients of Medicaid; making an
appropriation; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires Medicaid to cover certain home and community-based
2 services for persons with physical disabilities, including personal care services in
3 the home. (NRS 422.272407, 422.396) Section 1 of this bill requires the
4 Department of Health and Human Services to reimburse a member of the family of
5 a recipient of Medicaid for providing personal care services to the recipient, so long
6 as the recipient: (1) is less than 18 years of age; (2) is eligible under Medicaid to
7 receive coverage for personal care services; and (3) has been diagnosed with a
8 disability or chronic illness that renders the recipient unable to perform activities of
9 daily living without assistance.
10 Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to require the Director of the
11 Department to administer the provisions of section 1 in the same manner as other
12 provisions relating to Medicaid. Section 2.5 of this bill makes an appropriation to
13 and authorizes expenditures by the Division of Health Care Financing and Policy of
14 the Department for certain costs associated with the Department reimbursing a
15 member of the family of a recipient of Medicaid for providing personal care
16 services to the recipient pursuant to section 1.
