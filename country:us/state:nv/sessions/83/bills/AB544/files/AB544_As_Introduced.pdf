Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires a medical facility or a facility for the dependent to obtain
2 a license from the Division of Public and Behavioral Health of the Department of
3 Health and Human Services. (NRS 449.030) Under existing law, each such license
4 expires on December 31 of each year and may be renewed annually. (NRS
5 449.089) Section 1 of this bill instead provides that any such license: (1) expires 1
6 year after the date on which the license is issued, rather than on December 31; and
7 (2) may be renewed annually. Section 2 of this bill provides that a license which is
8 valid on December 30, 2025, remains valid until the anniversary date in 2026 of the
9 initial issuance of the license, at which time the license may be renewed in
10 accordance with section 1. Section 2 also requires the Division, upon the request of
11 a licensee, to assist the licensee in determining the anniversary date in 2026 of the
12 initial issuance of the license issued by the Division.
