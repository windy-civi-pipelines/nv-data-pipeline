for matching data for the collection of certain debts owed
to the State; authorizing the Department to disclose
certain confidential information to certain financial
institutions for certain purposes; revising certain

properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates the Department of Taxation, which has various powers and
2 duties related to the administration and collection of certain taxes, fees, assessments
3 and other amounts of money. (Chapter 360 of NRS) If a person owes delinquent
4 taxes or has a deficiency determination against him or her with respect to any tax
5 administered by the Department, existing law authorizes the Department to attempt
6 collection of the tax or deficiency in certain ways. (NRS 360.4193, 360.420,
7 360.473, 360.483) Section 1 of this bill requires the Department to develop and
8 operate a system for matching data to collect certain outstanding debts owed to the
9 State. Pursuant to section 1, financial institutions in this State must: (1) provide to
10 the Department information on persons who maintain accounts at the financial
11 institution and are identified by the Department as owing outstanding debts to the
12 State; and (2) encumber certain assets held in the financial institution by the debtors
13 to pay their debts.
14 Existing law makes the records and files of the Department of Taxation
15 concerning the administration and collection of taxes, fees, assessments and other
16 amounts and the imposition of disciplinary action confidential and privileged, but
-

17 authorizes the disclosure of such records and files under certain circumstances.
18 (NRS 360.255) Section 2 of this bill provides that the Department may disclose
19 certain confidential information to certain financial institutions for the purpose of
20 carrying out the provisions of section 1.
21 Existing law prohibits, with certain exceptions, a governmental agency from
22 requesting, and a financial institution from providing, certain financial records of
23 certain customers. (NRS 239A.070, 239A.080) Section 3 of this bill provides that
24 the Department may request, and a financial institution may provide to the
25 Department in response to such a request, certain financial records of certain
26 customers of the financial institution who owe outstanding debts to the State.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
