Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law defines “kratom product” to mean, in general, any product or
2 ingredient containing any part of the leaf of the Mitragyna Speciosa plant if the
3 plant contains the alkaloid mitragynine or 7-hydroxymitragynine, or any synthetic
4 material that contains the alkaloid mitragynine or 7-hydroxymitragynine. Existing
5 law prohibits a person from: (1) selling or offering to sell any material, compound,
6 mixture or preparation containing a kratom product to a child under the age of 18
7 years; (2) preparing, distributing, advertising, selling or offering to sell a kratom
8 product that is adulterated with certain substances; and (3) selling a kratom product
9 that does not have a label that meets certain requirements. Existing law provides for
10 the imposition of a civil penalty of not more than $1,000 against a person who
11 violates those prohibitions. (NRS 597.998)
12 Section 5 of this bill revises the definition of kratom product to mean food
13 containing any part of the leaf of the Mitragyna Speciosa plant. Section 9 of this
14 bill revises the prohibited acts relating to kratom products set forth under existing
15 law to revise: (1) requirements relating to the type of kratom products that a person
16 is prohibited from preparing, distributing, advertising, selling or offering to sell;
17 and (2) the information that must be included on a label for a kratom product.
18 Section 9 eliminates the civil penalty imposed for engaging in such prohibited acts
19 and section 8.7 of this bill instead provides for the imposition of administrative
20 fines by the Division of Public and Behavioral Health of the Department of Health
21 and Human Services for certain violations relating to kratom products.
22 Section 6 of this bill prohibits a person from selling or offering to sell a kratom
23 product to an end user unless the kratom product has been registered with the
24 Division. Section 6 sets forth certain requirements for a person to register a kratom
25 product with the Division.
26 Sections 6.5 and 8 of this bill set forth circumstances under which the Division
27 may require a person who registers a kratom product to submit the kratom product
28 to a laboratory for certain additional testing. Section 7.5 of this bill requires a
29 person who registers a kratom product to submit to the Division a copy of certain
30 reports concerning the kratom product that are required to be submitted to the
31 United States Food and Drug Administration.
32 Section 7 of this bill authorizes the Division to adopt certain regulations to
33 carry out the provisions of this bill. Section 9.8 of this bill makes an appropriation
34 from the State General Fund to the Division for personnel, travel, operating,
35 equipment and information services expenses to carry out the provisions of this bill.
36 Existing law sets forth the Uniform Controlled Substances Act, which
37 establishes various provisions relating to controlled substances, including, without
38 limitation, provisions establishing certain offenses concerning controlled
39 substances and the penalties for those offenses. (NRS 453.011-453.348)
40 Existing law authorizes the State Board of Pharmacy to adopt regulations to
41 add, delete or reschedule substances as controlled substances in schedules I, II, III,
42 IV or V pursuant to the Uniform Controlled Substances Act. (NRS 453.146)
43 Section 8.3 of this bill provides that if mitragynine or any of its constituent
44 alkaloids is added to a schedule of controlled substances, a person who engages in
45 the possession, delivery, production, sale or use of a kratom product that meets the
46 requirements of this bill and who confines his or her activities to those authorized
47 by this bill does not commit a violation of any law, ordinance, rule or regulation of
48 this State or any political subdivision of this State and any such conduct must not
49 constitute the basis for any investigation, detention, search, seizure, arrest,
50 prosecution or other legal penalty against the person. Section 9.7 of this bill
51 provides that the Uniform Controlled Substances Act and certain other provisions
52 governing controlled substances do not apply to the extent that they are inconsistent
53 with the provisions of sections 2-9 of this act.
