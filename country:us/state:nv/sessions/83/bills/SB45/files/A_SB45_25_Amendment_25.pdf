AN ACT relating to educational programs; revising provisions governing the award
of grants by the State Board of Education for programs of career and
technical education; [eliminating certain] revising provisions
governing reporting requirements for public schools that offer work-
based learning programs; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district in a county whose
2 population is 100,000 or more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties), and authorizes the
3 board of trustees of any other school district, to establish and maintain a program of career
4 and technical education to provide instruction in subjects approved by the State Board of
5 Education. (NRS 388.380) Existing law authorizes the Superintendent of Public Instruction
6 and the State Board to award grants to school districts and charter schools for programs of
7 career and technical education, including, without limitation, grants awarded based on criteria
8 established by the State Board but limited in amount according to the proportional enrollment
9 of pupils in programs of career and technical education in a school district or charter school.
10 (NRS 388.392-388.395) Section 1 of this bill revises the calculation of the limit on the
11 amount of this grant by providing that the limit is based on the proportion of pupils enrolled in
12 advanced courses within a program of career and technical education rather than the
13 proportion of all pupils enrolled in a program of career and technical education.
14 The federal Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act
15 provides grants to certain state agencies to, without limitation, promote programs of
16 career and technical education. (20 U.S.C. §§ 2301 et seq.) The Act additionally sets
17 forth certain: (1) reporting requirements that a state agency that receives a grant
18 pursuant to the Act must follow; (2) information that is required to be included in such a
19 report; and (3) characteristics for which certain performance data must be
20 disaggregated. (20 U.S.C. § 2323(b)(3)(C)) Existing law : (1) authorizes the board of
21 trustees of a school district or the governing body of a charter school to offer a work-based
22 learning program upon the approval of the Superintendent of Public Instruction [. (NRS
23 389.167) Section 2 of this bill eliminates the requirement for] ; and (2) requires a school
24 district or charter school that offers a work-based learning program to submit a report to the
25 State Board and the Legislature that contains certain information about the program, including
26 the number of participating pupils, disaggregated based on certain characteristics. (NRS

Senate Amendment No. 25 to Senate Bill No. 45 Page 4
27 389.167) Section 2 of this bill instead requires that the report contain the information
28 required to be included in the report submitted pursuant to the Act, disaggregated
29 according to the characteristics set forth in the Act.
