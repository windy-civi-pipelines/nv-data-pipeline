EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to educational programs; revising provisions
governing the award of grants by the State Board of
Education for programs of career and technical education;
revising provisions governing reporting requirements for
public schools that offer work-based learning programs;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district in a county
2 whose population is 100,000 or more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties), and
3 authorizes the board of trustees of any other school district, to establish and
4 maintain a program of career and technical education to provide instruction in
5 subjects approved by the State Board of Education. (NRS 388.380) Existing law
6 authorizes the Superintendent of Public Instruction and the State Board to award
7 grants to school districts and charter schools for programs of career and technical
8 education, including, without limitation, grants awarded based on criteria
9 established by the State Board but limited in amount according to the proportional
10 enrollment of pupils in programs of career and technical education in a school
11 district or charter school. (NRS 388.392-388.395) Section 1 of this bill revises the
12 calculation of the limit on the amount of this grant by providing that the limit is
13 based on the proportion of pupils enrolled in advanced courses within a program of
14 career and technical education rather than the proportion of all pupils enrolled in a
15 program of career and technical education.
16 The federal Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century
17 Act provides grants to certain state agencies to, without limitation, promote
18 programs of career and technical education. (20 U.S.C. §§ 2301 et seq.) The Act
19 additionally sets forth certain: (1) reporting requirements that a state agency that
20 receives a grant pursuant to the Act must follow; (2) information that is required to
-

– 2 –
21 be included in such a report; and (3) characteristics for which certain performance
22 data must be disaggregated. (20 U.S.C. § 2323(b)(3)(C)) Existing law: (1)
23 authorizes the board of trustees of a school district or the governing body of a
24 charter school to offer a work-based learning program upon the approval of the
25 Superintendent of Public Instruction; and (2) requires a school district or charter
26 school that offers a work-based learning program to submit a report to the State
27 Board and the Legislature that contains certain information about the program,
28 including the number of participating pupils, disaggregated based on certain
29 characteristics. (NRS 389.167) Section 2 of this bill instead requires that the report
30 contain the information required to be included in the report submitted pursuant to
31 the Act, disaggregated according to the characteristics set forth in the Act.
