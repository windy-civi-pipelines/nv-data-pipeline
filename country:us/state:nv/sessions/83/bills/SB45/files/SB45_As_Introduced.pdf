AN ACT relating to educational programs; revising provisions
governing the award of grants by the State Board of
Education for programs of career and technical education;
eliminating certain reporting requirements for public
schools that offer work-based learning programs; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district in a county
2 whose population is 100,000 or more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties), and
3 authorizes the board of trustees of any other school district, to establish and
4 maintain a program of career and technical education to provide instruction in
5 subjects approved by the State Board of Education. (NRS 388.380) Existing law
6 authorizes the Superintendent of Public Instruction and the State Board to award
7 grants to school districts and charter schools for programs of career and technical
8 education, including, without limitation, grants awarded based on criteria
9 established by the State Board but limited in amount according to the proportional
10 enrollment of pupils in programs of career and technical education in a school
11 district or charter school. (NRS 388.392-388.395) Section 1 of this bill revises the
12 calculation of the limit on the amount of this grant by providing that the limit is
13 based on the proportion of pupils enrolled in advanced courses within a program of
14 career and technical education rather than the proportion of all pupils enrolled in a
15 program of career and technical education.
16 Existing law authorizes the board of trustees of a school district or the
17 governing body of a charter school to offer a work-based learning program upon
18 the approval of the Superintendent of Public Instruction. (NRS 389.167) Section 2
19 of this bill eliminates the requirement for a school district or charter school that
20 offers a work-based learning program to submit a report to the State Board and the
