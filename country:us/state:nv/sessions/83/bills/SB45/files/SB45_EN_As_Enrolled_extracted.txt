Section 1:
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to educational programs; revising provisions
governing the award of grants by the State Board of
Education for programs of career and technical education;
revising provisions governing reporting requirements for
public schools that offer work-based learning programs; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district in a county
whose population is 100,000 or more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties), and
authorizes the board of trustees of any other school district, to establish and
maintain a program of career and technical education to provide instruction in
subjects approved by the State Board of Education. (NRS 388.380) Existing law
authorizes the Superintendent of Public Instruction and the State Board to award
grants to school districts and charter schools for programs of career and technical
education, including, without limitation, grants awarded based on criteria
established by the State Board but limited in amount according to the proportional
enrollment of pupils in programs of career and technical education in a school
district or charter school. (NRS 388.392-388.395) Section 1 of this bill revises the
calculation of the limit on the amount of this grant by providing that the limit is
based on the proportion of pupils enrolled in advanced courses within a program of
career and technical education rather than the proportion of all pupils enrolled in a
program of career and technical education.
The federal Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century
Act provides grants to certain state agencies to, without limitation, promote
programs of career and technical education. (20 U.S.C. §§ 2301 et seq.) The Act
additionally sets forth certain: (1) reporting requirements that a state agency that
receives a grant pursuant to the Act must follow; (2) information that is required to
be included in such a report; and (3) characteristics for which certain performance
data must be disaggregated. (20 U.S.C. § 2323(b)(3)(C)) Existing law: (1)
authorizes the board of trustees of a school district or the governing body of a
charter school to offer a work-based learning program upon the approval of the
Superintendent of Public Instruction; and (2) requires a school district or charter
school that offers a work-based learning program to submit a report to the State
Board and the Legislature that contains certain information about the program,
including the number of participating pupils, disaggregated based on certain
characteristics. (NRS 389.167) Section 2 of this bill instead requires that the report
contain the information required to be included in the report submitted pursuant to
the Act, disaggregated according to the characteristics set forth in the Act.
