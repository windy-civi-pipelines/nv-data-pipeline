SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION—Directing the Joint Interim Standing
Committee on the Judiciary to conduct an interim study concerning
human trafficking.
1 WHEREAS, Human trafficking remains a critical issue impacting individuals
2 and communities across the globe and especially in this State regardless of age,
3 gender, sexual orientation, nationality or religion and therefore necessitates urgent
4 legislative action; and
5 WHEREAS, This State has historically ranked high and continues to rank high,
6 regularly either first or second in the nation, in the frequency of human trafficking
7 cases; and
8 WHEREAS, This State understands that victims of human trafficking are similar
9 to victims of domestic violence and share several commonalities, including, without
10 limitation, experiences of coercion, manipulation, fear of retaliation and isolation,
11 significant financial and other forms of dependence and physical and psychological
12 harm that requires comprehensive support and intervention which often creates
13 barriers to escape and prosecution; and
14 WHEREAS, This State recognizes that increased oversight for entities or
15 individuals that provide assistance to combat human trafficking is essential and
16 defined standards such as investigatory standards would assist in the identification
17 and prosecution of offenders while at the same time protecting communities and
18 victims of human trafficking; and
19 WHEREAS, Establishing mandatory reporting by professionals across various
20 sectors of this State, including, without limitation, healthcare, security, hospitality,
21 education and law enforcement, is essential for the early identification and
22 correction of any gaps in reporting; and
23 WHEREAS, This State seeks to establish a more robust legal framework to
24 protect victims of human trafficking, mitigate the challenges associated with victim
25 participation in criminal proceedings, prosecute offenders and provide a
26 comprehensive support system through leveraging existing resources and exploring
27 new resources; and
28 WHEREAS, Convening stakeholders to study, strategize, prioritize and openly
29 identify and implement best practices in successful anti-human trafficking
30 frameworks from across the nation will ensure that a robust and cost-effective
Senate Amendment No. 922 to Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 3 Page 4
1 regulatory system exists for those involved in tracking, investigating and protecting
2 victims of human trafficking; now, therefore, be it

36 interests of victims of human trafficking in court proceedings, including a review of
