SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION—Directing the Joint
Interim Standing Committee on the Judiciary to conduct
an interim study concerning human trafficking.
1 WHEREAS, Human trafficking remains a critical issue impacting
2 individuals and communities across the globe and especially in this
3 State regardless of age, gender, sexual orientation, nationality or
4 religion and therefore necessitates urgent legislative action; and
5 WHEREAS, This State has historically ranked high and continues
6 to rank high, regularly either first or second in the nation, in the
7 frequency of human trafficking cases; and
8 WHEREAS, This State understands that victims of human
9 trafficking are similar to victims of domestic violence and share
10 several commonalities, including, without limitation, experiences of
11 coercion, manipulation, fear of retaliation and isolation, significant
12 financial and other forms of dependence and physical and
13 psychological harm that requires comprehensive support and
14 intervention which often creates barriers to escape and prosecution;
15 and
16 WHEREAS, This State recognizes that increased oversight for
17 entities or individuals that provide assistance to combat human
18 trafficking is essential and defined standards such as investigatory
19 standards would assist in the identification and prosecution of
20 offenders while at the same time protecting communities and
21 victims of human trafficking;
22 WHEREAS, Establishing mandatory reporting by professionals

10 WHEREAS, Convening stakeholders to study, strategize,
