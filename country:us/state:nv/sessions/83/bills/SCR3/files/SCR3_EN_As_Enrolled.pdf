FILE NUMBER..........
SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION—Directing the Joint
Interim Standing Committee on the Judiciary to conduct an
interim study concerning human trafficking.
WHEREAS, Human trafficking remains a critical issue impacting
individuals and communities across the globe and especially in this
State regardless of age, gender, sexual orientation, nationality or
religion and therefore necessitates urgent legislative action; and
WHEREAS, This State has historically ranked high and continues
to rank high, regularly either first or second in the nation, in the
frequency of human trafficking cases; and
WHEREAS, This State understands that victims of human
trafficking are similar to victims of domestic violence and share
several commonalities, including, without limitation, experiences of
coercion, manipulation, fear of retaliation and isolation, significant
financial and other forms of dependence and physical and
psychological harm that requires comprehensive support and
intervention which often creates barriers to escape and prosecution;
and
WHEREAS, This State recognizes that increased oversight for
entities or individuals that provide assistance to combat human
trafficking is essential and defined standards such as investigatory
standards would assist in the identification and prosecution of
offenders while at the same time protecting communities and
victims of human trafficking; and
WHEREAS, Establishing mandatory reporting by professionals
across various sectors of this State, including, without limitation,
healthcare, security, hospitality, education and law enforcement, is
essential for the early identification and correction of any gaps in
reporting; and
WHEREAS, This State seeks to establish a more robust legal
framework to protect victims of human trafficking, mitigate the
challenges associated with victim participation in criminal
proceedings, prosecute offenders and provide a comprehensive
support system through leveraging existing resources and exploring
new resources; and
WHEREAS, Convening stakeholders to study, strategize,
prioritize and openly identify and implement best practices in
successful anti-human trafficking frameworks from across the
nation will ensure that a robust and cost-effective regulatory system
