EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; providing that certain teachers have
sole authority to determine the grade assigned to a pupil
and the components and weights used to calculate such a
grade; prohibiting regulations, policies or directives that
interfere with such authority; prohibiting certain acts
intended to interfere with the grade assigned to a pupil or
the components or weights used to calculate such a grade;
eliminating provisions requiring certain teachers and
administrators to develop learning goals for pupils that are
used in the evaluations of such teachers and
administrators; providing a penalty; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the State Board of Education to adopt regulations that
2 provide a uniform grading scale for all public high schools, including, without
3 limitation, a grading scale for dual credit courses, international baccalaureate
4 courses, advanced placement courses and honors courses. (NRS 389.007) Section 2
5 of this bill provides that the teacher who provides instruction to a pupil, regardless
6 of the grade in which the pupil is enrolled, maintains sole discretion over: (1) the
7 assignment of a grade to the pupil; and (2) the determination of any components or
8 weights used in calculating the grade assigned to a pupil. Section 2 provides that a
9 person or entity, including, without limitation, the State Board of Education, the
10 Department of Education, the board of trustees of a school district, an administrator
11 or a teacher other than the instructor of the course, is prohibited from interfering
12 with the professional judgment of a teacher in assigning a grade to a pupil. Section
13 2 further: (1) prohibits any such person or entity from adopting a regulation, policy
-
*AB425*
– 2 –
14 or other directive that interferes with the professional judgment of a teacher in
15 assigning a grade to a pupil; and (2) voids and makes unenforceable any regulation,
16 policy or other directive that interferes with the professional judgment of a teacher
17 in assigning a grade to a pupil. Section 4 of this bill makes a conforming change by
18 removing the authority of a public high school to determine how the results of the
19 examination for civics will affect the grade of a pupil in the course in which the
20 examination is administered. (NRS 389.009)
21 Section 3 of this bill provides that an administrator or a parent or legal guardian
22 of a pupil is guilty of a misdemeanor if he or she intimidates, threatens, coerces or
23 harasses a teacher with the intent to interfere with or compel the teacher to alter any
24 grade assigned to the pupil or the components or weights used to calculate such a
25 grade. Section 3 provides that an administrator is guilty of a misdemeanor if he or
26 she disciplines or retaliates against a teacher for: (1) the grade assigned to a pupil;
27 or (2) the refusal of the teacher to alter such a grade or the components or weights
28 used to calculate such a grade.
29 Existing law: (1) requires each teacher and each administrator who provides
30 direct instructional services to pupils at a school to develop learning goals for his or
31 her pupils; (2) provides that pupil growth may be determined by the extent to which
32 the learning goals of a pupil are achieved; and (3) requires such learning goals and
33 pupil growth to be included in the evaluations of such teachers and administrators.
34 (NRS 391.480) Section 9 of this bill repeals those provisions. Sections 5-8 of this
35 bill make conforming changes to remove other references to learning goals and
36 pupil growth in existing law.

ASSEMBLY BILL NO. 425–ASSEMBLYMEMBER LA RUE HATCH
MARCH 13, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Education
SUMMARY—Revises provisions governing education.
(BDR 34-213)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: Increases or Newly
Provides for Term of Imprisonment in County or City
Jail or Detention Facility.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; providing that certain teachers have
sole authority to determine the grade assigned to a pupil
and the components and weights used to calculate such a
grade; prohibiting regulations, policies or directives that
interfere with such authority; prohibiting certain acts
intended to interfere with the grade assigned to a pupil or
the components or weights used to calculate such a grade;
eliminating provisions requiring certain teachers and
administrators to develop learning goals for pupils that are
used in the evaluations of such teachers and
administrators; providing a penalty; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the State Board of Education to adopt regulations that
2 provide a uniform grading scale for all public high schools, including, without
3 limitation, a grading scale for dual credit courses, international baccalaureate
4 courses, advanced placement courses and honors courses. (NRS 389.007) Section 2
5 of this bill provides that the teacher who provides instruction to a pupil, regardless
6 of the grade in which the pupil is enrolled, maintains sole discretion over: (1) the
7 assignment of a grade to the pupil; and (2) the determination of any components or
8 weights used in calculating the grade assigned to a pupil. Section 2 provides that a
9 person or entity, including, without limitation, the State Board of Education, the
10 Department of Education, the board of trustees of a school district, an administrator
11 or a teacher other than the instructor of the course, is prohibited from interfering
12 with the professional judgment of a teacher in assigning a grade to a pupil. Section
13 2 further: (1) prohibits any such person or entity from adopting a regulation, policy
-
*AB425*

– 2 –
14 or other directive that interferes with the professional judgment of a teacher in
15 assigning a grade to a pupil; and (2) voids and makes unenforceable any regulation,
16 policy or other directive that interferes with the professional judgment of a teacher
17 in assigning a grade to a pupil. Section 4 of this bill makes a conforming change by
18 removing the authority of a public high school to determine how the results of the
19 examination for civics will affect the grade of a pupil in the course in which the
20 examination is administered. (NRS 389.009)
21 Section 3 of this bill provides that an administrator or a parent or legal guardian
22 of a pupil is guilty of a misdemeanor if he or she intimidates, threatens, coerces or
23 harasses a teacher with the intent to interfere with or compel the teacher to alter any
24 grade assigned to the pupil or the components or weights used to calculate such a
25 grade. Section 3 provides that an administrator is guilty of a misdemeanor if he or
26 she disciplines or retaliates against a teacher for: (1) the grade assigned to a pupil;
27 or (2) the refusal of the teacher to alter such a grade or the components or weights
28 used to calculate such a grade.
29 Existing law: (1) requires each teacher and each administrator who provides
30 direct instructional services to pupils at a school to develop learning goals for his or
31 her pupils; (2) provides that pupil growth may be determined by the extent to which
32 the learning goals of a pupil are achieved; and (3) requires such learning goals and
33 pupil growth to be included in the evaluations of such teachers and administrators.
34 (NRS 391.480) Section 9 of this bill repeals those provisions. Sections 5-8 of this
35 bill make conforming changes to remove other references to learning goals and
36 pupil growth in existing law.
