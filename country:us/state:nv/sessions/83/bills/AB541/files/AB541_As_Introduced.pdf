EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to postconviction proceedings; revising provisions
relating to the payment of necessary costs and expenses
associated with certain proceedings based upon a
postconviction petition for a writ of habeas corpus; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes an offender who is convicted of a crime and under a
2 sentence of death or imprisonment to file a postconviction petition for a writ of
3 habeas corpus to challenge the validity of a judgment of conviction or the
4 computation of time that the person has served pursuant to a judgment of
5 conviction. (NRS 34.724) Such a petition may allege that the petitioner is unable to
6 pay the costs of the proceedings or to employ counsel. Under existing law, if the
7 court determines that the petitioner is unable to pay all necessary costs and
8 expenses incident to the proceedings and certain other requirements are met, the
9 costs must be paid from money appropriated to the Office of State Public Defender
10 for that purpose. After appropriations for that purpose are exhausted, existing law
11 requires that money be allocated to the Office of State Public Defender from the
12 Reserve for Statutory Contingency Account for the payment of the costs, expenses
13 and compensation. (NRS 34.750) Section 1 of this bill instead requires those costs
14 to be paid from money appropriated to the Department of Indigent Defense
15 Services for that purpose. After those appropriations are exhausted, section 1
16 requires that money be allocated to the Department of Indigent Defense Services
17 from the Reserve for Statutory Contingency Account for the payment of the costs,
18 expenses and compensation. Section 2 of this bill makes the same change in certain
19 generally applicable statutory provisions relating to the payment of compensation

5 not dismissed summarily, the court may appoint counsel to represent
