Assembly Bill No. 541–Committee on Ways and Means
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to postconviction proceedings; revising provisions
relating to the payment of necessary costs and expenses
associated with certain proceedings based upon a
postconviction petition for a writ of habeas corpus; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law authorizes an offender who is convicted of a crime and under a
sentence of death or imprisonment to file a postconviction petition for a writ of
habeas corpus to challenge the validity of a judgment of conviction or the
computation of time that the person has served pursuant to a judgment of
conviction. (NRS 34.724) Such a petition may allege that the petitioner is unable to
pay the costs of the proceedings or to employ counsel. Under existing law, if the
court determines that the petitioner is unable to pay all necessary costs and
expenses incident to the proceedings and certain other requirements are met, the
costs must be paid from money appropriated to the Office of State Public Defender
for that purpose. After appropriations for that purpose are exhausted, existing law
requires that money be allocated to the Office of State Public Defender from the
Reserve for Statutory Contingency Account for the payment of the costs, expenses
and compensation. (NRS 34.750) Section 1 of this bill instead requires those costs
to be paid from money appropriated to the Department of Indigent Defense
Services for that purpose. After those appropriations are exhausted, section 1
requires that money be allocated to the Department of Indigent Defense Services
from the Reserve for Statutory Contingency Account for the payment of the costs,
expenses and compensation. Section 2 of this bill makes the same change in certain
generally applicable statutory provisions relating to the payment of compensation
and expenses of an attorney appointed to represent an indigent defendant or
petitioner.
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
