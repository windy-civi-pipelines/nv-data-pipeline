5 ordinance that authorizes the owner of a residential property to apply to add an
6 accessory dwelling unit to the residential property. Section 1 further requires the
7 ordinance to authorize, under certain circumstances, an additional accessory
8 dwelling unit to the residential property. Section 1 also sets forth various
9 requirements for the ordinance, including that the ordinance set forth an expedited
10 process for the approval of the application and any appeal of the denial of such an
11 application. Section 1 further limits provisions of the ordinance, including by
12 prohibiting the ordinance from placing certain conditions on the approval of the
13 accessory dwelling unit.
14 Section 11 of this bill provides that if the governing body of a county whose
15 population is 100,000 or more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties) or the
16 governing body of a city whose population is 60,000 or more (currently the Cities
17 of Las Vegas, Henderson, North Las Vegas, Reno and Sparks) does not adopt an
18 ordinance that meets the requirements of section 1 before January 1, 2026,
19 accessory dwelling units are authorized on any parcel zoned for residential use
20 without restriction.
21 Section 12 of this bill provides that any ordinance adopted by the governing
22 body of a county or city before, on or after January 1, 2026, that conflicts with
23 section 1 is void and unenforceable.
24 Existing law authorizes the governing body of a county or city to divide the
25 county, city or region into zoning districts of such number, shape and area as are
26 best suited to carry out certain purposes. Within a zoning district, the governing
27 body is authorized to regulate and restrict the erection, reconstruction, alteration,
28 repair or use of buildings, structures or land. (NRS 278.250) Section 4 of this bill
29 creates an exception to account for the requirement that the governing body of
30 certain counties and cities adopt an ordinance to allow the addition of an accessory
31 dwelling unit pursuant to section 1.
32 Existing law requires that an action or proceeding seeking judicial relief or
33 review from or with respect to any final action, decision or order of any governing
34 body of a county or city be commenced within 25 days after the date of filing of
35 notice of the final action, decision or order with the clerk or secretary of the
36 governing body. (NRS 278.0235) Section 3 of this bill applies these provisions to
37 section 1.
38 Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to apply the definitions of
39 certain terms relating to planning and zoning to section 1.
40 Existing law sets forth certain requirements for the amendment of a declaration
41 of a common-interest community, including that every amendment to the
42 declaration must, with certain exceptions, be indexed in the grantee’s index in the
43 name of the common-interest community and the association and in the grantor’s
44 index in the name of the parties executing the amendment. (NRS 116.2117) Section
45 5 of this bill eliminates the exception for an amendment for the relocation of
46 boundaries between adjoining units. (NRS 116.2112)
47 Section 5 also authorizes an association to amend a declaration to restrict the
48 leasing of residential units to the extent that the restriction is reasonably designed to
49 meet certain underwriting requirements.
50 Existing law sets forth the requirements for terminating a common-interest
51 community. (NRS 116.2118) Section 6 of this bill amends the voting requirements
52 for terminating a common-interest community.
53 Sections 7 and 8 of this bill revise provisions relating to prohibiting or
54 restricting a unit owner from renting or leasing his or her unit.
55 Existing law requires a unit’s owner or his or her authorized agent, at the
56 expense of the unit’s owner, to furnish to a purchaser a resale package containing
57 certain information. (NRS 116.4109) Section 9 of this bill requires that a resale
58 package also contain proof of the insurance policies that an association is required
59 to carry.

43 are allocated, unless the declaration specifies a different percentage
44 for all amendments or for specified subjects of amendment. If the
-
*AB396*

– 8 –
1 declaration requires the approval of another person as a condition of
2 its effectiveness, the amendment is not valid without that approval.
3 2. No action to challenge the validity of an amendment adopted
4 by the association pursuant to this section may be brought more than
5 1 year after the amendment is recorded.
6 3. Every amendment to the declaration must be recorded in
7 every county in which any portion of the common-interest
8 community is located and is effective only upon recordation. An
9 amendment [, except an amendment pursuant to NRS 116.2112,]
10 must be indexed in the grantee’s index in the name of the common-
11 interest community and the association and in the grantor’s index in
12 the name of the parties executing the amendment.
13 4. Except to the extent expressly permitted or required by other
14 provisions of this chapter, no amendment may change the
15 boundaries of any unit or change the allocated interests of a unit in
16 the absence of unanimous consent of only those units’ owners
17 whose units are affected and the consent of a majority of the owners
18 of the remaining units [.] , including a majority of the votes
19 allocated to units not owned by the declarant.
20 5. Amendments to the declaration required by this chapter to
21 be recorded by the association must be prepared, executed, recorded
22 and certified on behalf of the association by any officer of the
23 association designated for that purpose or, in the absence of
24 designation, by the president of the association.
25 6. [An] Except as otherwise provided in subsection 9, an
26 amendment to the declaration which prohibits or materially restricts
27 the permitted uses of a unit or the number or other qualifications of
28 persons who may occupy units may not be enforced against a unit’s
29 owner who was the owner of the unit on the date of the recordation
30 of the amendment as long as the unit’s owner remains the owner of
31 that unit.
32 7. A provision in the declaration creating special declarant’s
33 rights that have not expired may not be amended without the
34 consent of the declarant.
35 8. If any provision of this chapter or of the declaration requires
36 the consent of a holder of a security interest in a unit, or an insurer
37 or guarantor of such interest, as a condition to the effectiveness of

40 writing, notice of any proposed amendment; or
41 (b) Notice of any proposed amendment is required or has been
42 requested and a written refusal to consent is not received by the

44 proposed amendment to the holder, insurer or guarantor, by certified
-
*AB396*

– 9 –
1 mail, return receipt requested, to the address for notice provided by
2 the holder, insurer or guarantor in a prior written request for notice.
3 9. An association may amend a declaration to restrict the
4 leasing of residential units to the extent that the restriction is
5 reasonably designed to meet underwriting requirements of:
6 (a) Institutional lenders that regularly make loans secured by
7 first mortgages on units in common-interest communities or
8 regularly purchase such mortgages; or
9 (b) Insurance companies that issue insurance policies to
10 associations or units in a common-interest community.
11 Sec. 6. NRS 116.2118 is hereby amended to read as follows:
12 116.2118 1. Except in the case of a taking of all the units by
13 eminent domain, in the case of foreclosure against an entire
14 cooperative of a security interest that has priority over the
15 declaration, or in the circumstances described in NRS 116.2124, a
16 common-interest community may be terminated only by agreement
17 of units’ owners to whom at least 80 percent of the votes in the
18 association are allocated, [or any larger percentage the declaration
19 specifies,] including at least 80 percent of the votes allocated to
20 units that are not owned by the declarant, and with any other
21 approvals required by the declaration. The declaration may require
22 a larger percentage of the total votes in the association for
23 approval, but termination requires approval by at least 80 percent
24 of the votes allocated to units not owned by the declarant. The
25 declaration may specify a smaller percentage only if all of the units
26 are restricted exclusively to nonresidential uses.
27 2. An agreement to terminate must be evidenced by the
28 execution of an agreement to terminate, or ratifications thereof, in
29 the same manner as a deed, by the requisite number of units’
30 owners. The agreement must specify a date after which the
31 agreement will be void unless it is recorded before that date. An
32 agreement to terminate and all ratifications thereof must be recorded
33 in every county in which a portion of the common-interest
34 community is situated and is effective only upon recordation.
35 3. In the case of a condominium or planned community
36 containing only units having horizontal boundaries described in the
37 declaration, an agreement to terminate may provide that all of the
38 common elements and units of the common-interest community
39 must be sold following termination. If, pursuant to the agreement,
40 any real estate in the common-interest community is to be sold
41 following termination, the agreement must set forth the minimum
42 terms of the sale.
43 4. In the case of a condominium or planned community
44 containing any units not having horizontal boundaries described in
45 the declaration, an agreement to terminate may provide for sale of
-
*AB396*

– 10 –
1 the common elements, but it may not require that the units be sold
2 following termination, unless the declaration as originally recorded
3 provided otherwise or all the units’ owners consent to the sale.
4 5. The association, on behalf of the units’ owners, may contract
5 for the sale of real estate in a common-interest community, but the
6 contract is not binding on the units’ owners until approved pursuant
7 to subsections 1 and 2. If any real estate is to be sold following
8 termination, title to that real estate, upon termination, vests in the
9 association as trustee for the holders of all interests in the units.
10 Thereafter, the association has all powers necessary and appropriate
11 to effect the sale. Until the sale has been concluded and the proceeds
12 thereof distributed, the association continues in existence with all
13 powers it had before termination. Proceeds of the sale must be
14 distributed to units’ owners and lienholders as their interests may
15 appear, in accordance with NRS 116.21183 and 116.21185. Unless
16 otherwise specified in the agreement to terminate, as long as the
17 association holds title to the real estate, each unit’s owner and his or
18 her successors in interest have an exclusive right to occupancy of
19 the portion of the real estate that formerly constituted the unit.
20 During the period of that occupancy, each unit’s owner and his or
21 her successors in interest remain liable for all assessments and other
22 obligations imposed on units’ owners by this chapter or the
23 declaration.
24 6. In a condominium or planned community, if the real estate
25 constituting the common-interest community is not to be sold
26 following termination, title to the common elements and, in a
27 common-interest community containing only units having
28 horizontal boundaries described in the declaration, title to all the real
29 estate in the common-interest community, vests in the units’ owners
30 upon termination as tenants in common in proportion to their
31 respective interests as provided in NRS 116.21185, and liens on the
32 units shift accordingly. While the tenancy in common exists, each
33 unit’s owner and his or her successors in interest have an exclusive
34 right to occupancy of the portion of the real estate that formerly
35 constituted the unit.
36 7. Following termination of the common-interest community,
37 the proceeds of a sale of real estate, together with the assets of the
38 association, are held by the association as trustee for units’ owners
39 and holders of liens on the units as their interests may appear.
40 Sec. 7. NRS 116.31065 is hereby amended to read as follows:
41 116.31065 The rules adopted by an association:
42 1. Must be reasonably related to the purpose for which they are
43 adopted.

2 limitation to inform a person of any action or omission required for
3 compliance.
4 3. Must not be adopted to evade any obligation of the
5 association.
6 4. [Must] Except as otherwise provided in subsection 1 of
7 NRS 116.335, must be consistent with the governing documents of
8 the association and must not arbitrarily restrict conduct or require
9 the construction of any capital improvement by a unit’s owner that
10 is not required by the governing documents of the association.
11 5. Must be uniformly enforced under the same or similar
12 circumstances against all units’ owners. Any rule that is not so
13 uniformly enforced may not be enforced against any unit’s owner.
14 6. May be enforced by the association through the imposition
15 of a fine only if the association complies with the requirements set
16 forth in NRS 116.31031.
17 Sec. 8. NRS 116.335 is hereby amended to read as follows:
18 116.335 1. [Unless, at the time a unit’s owner purchased his
19 or her unit,] If the declaration [prohibited the unit’s owner from
20 renting or leasing his or her unit,] authorizes the association [may
21 not] to prohibit or restrict the unit’s owner from renting or leasing
22 his or her unit [.] , or contains a provision establishing a maximum
23 number or percentage of units in the common-interest community
24 which may be rented or leased, the association may adopt rules
25 and regulations to prohibit or restrict the renting or leasing of
26 residential units to the extent that the restriction is reasonably
27 related to meet underwriting requirements of:
28 (a) Institutional lenders that regularly make loans secured by
29 first mortgages on units in common-interest communities or
30 regularly purchase such mortgages; or
31 (b) Insurance companies that issue insurance policies to
32 associations or units in a common-interest community.
33 2. [Unless, at the time a unit’s owner purchased his or her unit,
34 the declaration required the unit’s owner to secure or obtain any
35 approval from the association in order to rent or lease his or her unit,
36 an association may not require the unit’s owner to secure or obtain
37 any approval from the association in order to rent or lease his or her
38 unit.
39 3. If a declaration contains a provision establishing a maximum
40 number or percentage of units in the common-interest community
41 which may be rented or leased, that provision of the declaration may
42 not be amended to decrease that maximum number or percentage of
43 units in the common-interest community which may be rented or
44 leased.

1 4. If the governing documents of an association require a unit’s
2 owner who leases or rents his or her unit, or the tenant of a unit’s
3 owner, to register with the association or its agent or otherwise
4 submit to the association or its agent information concerning the
5 lease or rental agreement or the tenant, the association or its agent:
6 (a) Must conduct such activities in accordance with the
7 governing documents;
8 (b) May not require the unit’s owner or tenant of the unit’s
9 owner to provide information which the association or its agent does
10 not require to be provided to the association or its agent by a unit’s
11 owner who occupies his or her unit, except that the association or its
12 agent may require the unit’s owner to provide a copy of the lease or
13 rental agreement; and
14 (c) May not charge a fee to the unit’s owner for the registration
15 or submission of information.
16 5.] The provisions of this section do not prohibit an association
17 from enforcing any provisions which govern the renting or leasing
18 of units and which are contained in this chapter or in any other
19 applicable federal, state or local laws or regulations [.
20 6.] , including, without limitation, any restriction on the rental
21 of units as transient lodging pursuant to NRS 244.35351 to
22 244.35359, inclusive, or 268.09791 to 268.09799, inclusive.
23 3. Notwithstanding any other provision of law or the
24 declaration to the contrary:
25 (a) If a unit’s owner is prohibited from renting or leasing a unit
26 because the maximum number or percentage of units which may be
27 rented or leased in the common-interest community have already
28 been rented or leased, the unit’s owner may seek a waiver of the
29 prohibition from the executive board based upon a showing of
30 economic hardship, and the executive board may grant such a
31 waiver and approve the renting or leasing of the unit.
32 (b) If the declaration contains a provision establishing a
33 maximum number or percentage of units in the common-interest
34 community which may be rented or leased, in determining the
35 maximum number or percentage of units in the common-interest
36 community which may be rented or leased, the number of units
37 owned by the declarant must not be counted or considered.
38 Sec. 9. NRS 116.4109 is hereby amended to read as follows:
39 116.4109 1. Except in the case of a sale in which delivery of
40 a public offering statement is required, or unless exempt under

42 authorized agent shall, at the expense of the unit’s owner, furnish to
43 a purchaser a resale package containing all of the following:

7 fees, transfer fees, fines, penalties, interest, collection costs,
8 foreclosure fees and attorney’s fees currently due from the selling
9 unit’s owner.
10 (c) A copy of the current operating budget of the association and
11 current year-to-date financial statement for the association, which
12 must include a summary of the reserves of the association required
13 by NRS 116.31152 and which must include, without limitation, a
14 summary of the information described in paragraphs (a) to (e),
15 inclusive, of subsection 3 of NRS 116.31152.
16 (d) A statement of any unsatisfied judgments or pending legal
17 actions against the association and the status of any pending legal
18 actions relating to the common-interest community of which the
19 unit’s owner has actual knowledge.
20 (e) A statement of any transfer fees, transaction fees or any other
21 fees associated with the resale of a unit.
22 (f) In addition to any other document, a statement describing all

25 or penalties, interest rates on delinquent assessments, additional
26 costs for collecting past due fines and charges for opening or closing
27 any file for each unit.
28 (g) Proof of the insurance policies that an association is
29 required to carry pursuant to NRS 116.3113.
30 2. The purchaser may, by written notice, cancel the contract of
31 purchase until midnight of the fifth calendar day following the date
32 of receipt of the resale package described in subsection 1, and the
33 contract for purchase must contain a provision to that effect. If the
34 purchaser elects to cancel a contract pursuant to this subsection,
35 the purchaser must hand deliver the notice of cancellation to the
36 unit’s owner or his or her authorized agent, mail the notice of
37 cancellation by prepaid United States mail to the unit’s owner or his
38 or her authorized agent or deliver the notice of cancellation by
39 electronic transmission to the unit’s owner or his or her authorized
40 agent. Cancellation is without penalty, and all payments made by
41 the purchaser before cancellation must be refunded promptly. If the
42 purchaser has accepted a conveyance of the unit, the purchaser is
43 not entitled to:
44 (a) Cancel the contract pursuant to this subsection; or
-
*AB396*

– 14 –
1 (b) Damages, rescission or other relief based solely on the
2 ground that the unit’s owner or his or her authorized agent failed to
3 furnish the resale package, or any portion thereof, as required by this
4 section.
5 3. Within 10 calendar days after receipt of a written request by
6 a unit’s owner or his or her authorized agent, the association shall
7 furnish all of the following to the unit’s owner or his or her
8 authorized agent for inclusion in the resale package:
9 (a) Copies of the documents required pursuant to paragraphs (a)
10 and (c) of subsection 1; and
11 (b) A certificate containing the information necessary to enable
12 the unit’s owner to comply with paragraphs (b), (d), (e) , [and] (f)
13 and (g) of subsection 1.
14 4. If the association furnishes the documents and certificate
15 pursuant to subsection 3:
16 (a) The unit’s owner or his or her authorized agent shall include
17 the documents and certificate in the resale package provided to the
18 purchaser, and neither the unit’s owner nor his or her authorized
19 agent is liable to the purchaser for any erroneous information
20 provided by the association and included in the documents and
21 certificate.
22 (b) The association may charge the unit’s owner a reasonable
23 fee to cover the cost of preparing the certificate furnished pursuant
24 to subsection 3. Such a fee must be based on the actual cost the
25 association incurs to fulfill the requirements of this section in
26 preparing the certificate and must not exceed $185, except that if a
27 unit’s owner or an authorized agent thereof requests that the
28 certificate be furnished sooner than 3 business days after the date of
29 the request, the association may charge a fee, which must not exceed
30 $100, to expedite the preparation of the certificate. The amount of
31 the fee may increase, on an annual basis, by a percentage equal to
32 the percentage of increase in the Consumer Price Index (All Items)
33 published by the United States Department of Labor for the
34 preceding calendar year, but must not increase by more than 3
35 percent each year.
36 (c) The other documents furnished pursuant to subsection 3
37 must be provided in electronic format to the unit’s owner. If the
38 association is unable to provide such documents in electronic
39 format, the association may charge the unit’s owner a reasonable
40 fee, not to exceed 25 cents per page for the first 10 pages, and 10
41 cents per page thereafter, to cover the cost of copying.
42 (d) Except for the fees allowed pursuant to paragraphs (b) and
43 (c), the association may not charge the unit’s owner any other fees
44 for preparing or furnishing the documents and certificate pursuant to
45 subsection 3.

*AB396*

– 15 –
1 5. Neither a purchaser nor the purchaser’s interest in a unit is
2 liable for any unpaid assessment or fee greater than the amount set
3 forth in the documents and certificate prepared by the association. If
4 the association fails to furnish the documents and certificate within
5 the 10 calendar days allowed by this section, the purchaser is not
6 liable for the delinquent assessment. A resale package provided to a
7 unit’s owner or his or her authorized agent pursuant to this section
8 remains effective for 90 calendar days.
9 6. Upon the request of a unit’s owner or his or her authorized
10 agent, or upon the request of a purchaser to whom the unit’s owner
11 has provided a resale package pursuant to this section or his or her
12 authorized agent, the association shall make the entire study of the
13 reserves of the association which is required by NRS 116.31152
14 reasonably available for the unit’s owner, purchaser or authorized
15 agent to inspect, examine, photocopy and audit. The study must be
16 made available at the business office of the association or some
17 other suitable location within the county where the common-interest
18 community is situated or, if it is situated in more than one county,
19 within one of those counties.
20 7. A unit’s owner, the authorized agent of the unit’s owner or
21 the holder of a security interest on the unit may request a statement
22 of demand from the association. Not later than 10 calendar days
23 after receipt of a written request from the unit’s owner, the
24 authorized agent of the unit’s owner or the holder of a security
25 interest on the unit for a statement of demand, the association shall
26 furnish a statement of demand to the person who requested the
27 statement and provide a copy of the statement to any other interested
28 party. The association may charge a fee of not more than $165 to
29 prepare and furnish a statement of demand pursuant to this
30 subsection and an additional fee of not more than $100 to furnish a
31 statement of demand within 3 business days after receipt of a written
32 request for a statement of demand. The amount of the fees for
33 preparing and furnishing a statement of demand and the additional
34 fee for furnishing a statement of demand within 3 business days may
35 increase, on an annual basis, by a percentage equal to the percentage
36 of increase in the Consumer Price Index (All Items) published by
37 the United States Department of Labor for the preceding calendar
38 year, but must not increase by more than 3 percent each year. The
39 statement of demand:
40 (a) Must set forth the amount of the monthly assessment for
41 common expenses and any unpaid obligation of any kind, including,
42 without limitation, management fees, transfer fees, fines, penalties,
43 interest, collection costs, foreclosure fees and attorney’s fees
44 currently due from the selling unit’s owner; and
-
*AB396*

– 16 –
1 (b) Remains effective for the period specified in the statement of
2 demand, which must not be less than 15 business days after the date
3 of delivery by the association to the unit’s owner, the authorized
4 agent of the unit’s owner or the holder of a security interest on the
5 unit, whichever is applicable.
6  As used in this subsection, “interested party” includes the unit’s
7 owner selling the unit and the prospective purchaser of the unit.
8 8. In preparing, copying, furnishing or expediting or otherwise
9 providing any document or other item pursuant to this section, an
10 association, or entity related to or acting on behalf of an association,
11 shall not charge a unit’s owner, the authorized agent of a unit’s
12 owner, a purchaser or, pursuant to subsection 7, the holder of a
13 security interest on a unit, any fee:
14 (a) Not authorized in this section; or
15 (b) In an amount which exceeds any limit set forth in this
16 section.
17 9. If the association becomes aware of an error in a statement
18 of demand furnished pursuant to subsection 7 during the period in
19 which the statement of demand is effective but before the
20 consummation of a resale for which a resale package was furnished
21 pursuant to subsection 1, the association must deliver a replacement
22 statement of demand to the person who requested the statement of
23 demand. Unless the person who requested the statement of demand
24 receives a replacement statement of demand, the person may rely
25 upon the accuracy of the information set forth in the statement of
26 demand provided by the association for the resale. Payment of the
27 amount set forth in the statement of demand constitutes full payment
28 of the amount due from the selling unit’s owner.
29 Sec. 10. NRS 116.785 is hereby amended to read as follows:
30 116.785 1. If the Commission or the hearing panel, after
31 notice and hearing, finds that the respondent has committed a
32 violation, the Commission or the hearing panel may take any or all
33 of the following actions:

38 action to correct any conditions resulting from the violation.
39 (c) Impose an administrative fine of not more than [$1,000]
40 $5,000 for each violation.
41 2. If the respondent is a member of an executive board or an
42 officer of an association, the Commission or the hearing panel may
43 order the respondent removed from his or her office or position if
44 the Commission or the hearing panel, after notice and hearing, finds
45 that:
-
*AB396*

– 17 –
1 (a) The respondent has knowingly and willfully committed a
2 violation; and
3 (b) The removal is in the best interest of the association.
4 3. If the respondent violates any order issued by the
5 Commission or the hearing panel pursuant to this section, the
6 Commission or the hearing panel, after notice and hearing, may
7 impose an administrative fine of not more than [$1,000] $5,000 for
8 each violation.
9 4. If the Commission or the hearing panel takes any
10 disciplinary action pursuant to this section, the Commission or the
11 hearing panel may order the respondent to pay the costs of the
12 proceedings incurred by the Division, including, without limitation,
13 the cost of the investigation and reasonable attorney’s fees.
14 5. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, unless
15 the respondent has knowingly and willfully committed a violation, if
16 the respondent is a member of an executive board or an officer of an
17 association:
18 (a) The association is liable for all fines and costs imposed
19 against the respondent pursuant to this section; and
20 (b) The respondent may not be held personally liable for those
21 fines and costs.
22 Sec. 11. If the governing body of a county whose population is
23 100,000 or more or the governing body of a city whose population
24 is 60,000 or more does not adopt an ordinance that meets the
25 requirements of section 1 of this act before January 1, 2026,
26 accessory dwelling units are authorized on any parcel zoned for
27 residential use without restriction.
28 Sec. 12. Any ordinance adopted by the governing body of a
29 county or city that conflicts with the provisions of section 1 of this
30 act before, on or after January 1, 2026, is void and unenforceable.
31 Sec. 13. The provisions of NRS 354.599 do not apply to any
32 additional expenses of a local government that are related to the
33 provisions of this act.
34 Sec. 14. 1. This section and section 13 of this act become
35 effective upon passage and approval.
