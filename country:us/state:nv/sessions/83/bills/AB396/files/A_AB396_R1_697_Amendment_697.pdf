residential properties to add] development and use of accessory
dwelling units [to the] on residential property; setting forth certain
requirements for the ordinance; providing that if the governing body of

matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Section 10.5 of this bill declares that access to affordable housing is essential for the
2 residents of this State and that accessory dwelling units are vital to increasing the supply
3 of affordable housing.
4 Section 1 of this bill requires each governing body of a county whose population is
5 100,000 or more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties) and each governing body of a city
6 whose population is 60,000 or more (currently the Cities of Las Vegas, Henderson, North Las
7 Vegas, Reno and Sparks) to adopt an ordinance that authorizes the [owner of a residential
8 property to apply to add] development and use of an accessory dwelling unit [to the] on
9 residential property. Section 1 provides that any such ordinance does not apply in a region in
10 a county or city for which there has been created by interstate compact a regional planning
11 agency and the regional plan adopted by the regional planning agency calls for the regulation
12 of housing. [Section 1 further requires the ordinance to authorize, under certain circumstances,
13 an additional accessory dwelling unit to the residential property. Section 1 also sets forth

Senate Amendment No. 697 to Assembly Bill No. 396 First Reprint Page 4
14 various requirements for the ordinance, including that the ordinance set forth an expedited
15 process for the approval of the application and any appeal of the denial of such an
16 application.] Section 1 further limits provisions of the ordinance, including by prohibiting the
17 ordinance from placing certain conditions on the approval of the accessory dwelling unit.
18 Section 11 of this bill provides that: (1) if, before [January] July 1, 2026, the governing
19 body of a county whose population is 100,000 or more or the governing body of a city whose
20 population is 60,000 or more has adopted an ordinance that is consistent with section 1, the
21 governing body is not required to adopt another ordinance relating to accessory dwelling units
22 pursuant to section 1; and (2) if the governing body of a county whose population is 100,000
23 or more or the governing body of a city whose population is 60,000 or more does not adopt an
24 ordinance that is consistent with section 1 before [January] July 1, 2026, accessory dwelling
25 units are authorized on any parcel zoned for residential use without restriction.
26 Existing law authorizes the governing body of a county or city to divide the county, city
27 or region into zoning districts of such number, shape and area as are best suited to carry out
28 certain purposes. Within a zoning district, the governing body is authorized to regulate and
29 restrict the erection, reconstruction, alteration, repair or use of buildings, structures or land.
30 (NRS 278.250) Section 4 of this bill creates an exception to account for the requirement that
31 the governing body of certain counties and cities adopt an ordinance to allow the addition of
32 an accessory dwelling unit pursuant to section 1.
33 Existing law requires that an action or proceeding seeking judicial relief or review from
34 or with respect to any final action, decision or order of any governing body of a county or city
35 be commenced within 25 days after the date of filing of notice of the final action, decision or
36 order with the clerk or secretary of the governing body. (NRS 278.0235) Section 3 of this bill
37 applies these provisions to section 1.
38 Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to apply the definitions of certain terms
39 relating to planning and zoning to section 1.
40 Existing law sets forth certain requirements for the amendment of a declaration of a
41 common-interest community, including that every amendment to the declaration must, with
42 certain exceptions, be indexed in the grantee’s index in the name of the common-interest
43 community and the association and in the grantor’s index in the name of the parties executing
44 the amendment. (NRS 116.2117) Section 5 of this bill eliminates the exception for an
45 amendment for the relocation of boundaries between adjoining units. (NRS 116.2112)
46 Section 5 also authorizes an association to amend a declaration to restrict the leasing of
47 residential units to the extent that the restriction is reasonably designed to meet certain
48 underwriting requirements.
49 Existing law sets forth the requirements for terminating a common-interest community.
50 (NRS 116.2118) Section 6 of this bill amends the voting requirements for terminating a
51 common-interest community.
52 Sections 7 and 8 of this bill revise provisions relating to prohibiting or restricting a unit
53 owner from renting or leasing his or her unit.
54 Existing law requires a unit’s owner or his or her authorized agent, at the expense of the
55 unit’s owner, to furnish to a purchaser a resale package containing certain information. (NRS
56 116.4109) Section 9 of this bill requires that a resale package also contain proof of the
57 insurance policies that an association is required to carry.
58 Existing law authorizes, under certain circumstances, the Commission for Common-
59 Interest Communities and Condominium Hotels to impose an administrative fine of not more
60 than $1,000 for certain violations. (NRS 116.785) Section 10 of this bill increases the
61 administrative fine to not more than $5,000.

35 units’ owners of units to which at least a majority of the votes in the association are
36 allocated, unless the declaration specifies a different percentage for all amendments
37 or for specified subjects of amendment. If the declaration requires the approval of
38 another person as a condition of its effectiveness, the amendment is not valid
39 without that approval.
40 2. No action to challenge the validity of an amendment adopted by the
41 association pursuant to this section may be brought more than 1 year after the
42 amendment is recorded.
43 3. Every amendment to the declaration must be recorded in every county in
44 which any portion of the common-interest community is located and is effective
45 only upon recordation. An amendment [, except an amendment pursuant to NRS
46 116.2112,] must be indexed in the grantee’s index in the name of the common-
47 interest community and the association and in the grantor’s index in the name of the
48 parties executing the amendment.
49 4. Except to the extent expressly permitted or required by other provisions of
50 this chapter, no amendment may change the boundaries of any unit or change the
51 allocated interests of a unit in the absence of unanimous consent of only those
52 units’ owners whose units are affected and the consent of a majority of the owners

1 of the remaining units [.] , including a majority of the votes allocated to units not
2 owned by the declarant.
3 5. Amendments to the declaration required by this chapter to be recorded by
4 the association must be prepared, executed, recorded and certified on behalf of the
5 association by any officer of the association designated for that purpose or, in the
6 absence of designation, by the president of the association.

11 recordation of the amendment as long as the unit’s owner remains the owner of that
12 unit.
13 7. A provision in the declaration creating special declarant’s rights that have
14 not expired may not be amended without the consent of the declarant.
15 8. If any provision of this chapter or of the declaration requires the consent of
16 a holder of a security interest in a unit, or an insurer or guarantor of such interest, as
17 a condition to the effectiveness of an amendment to the declaration, that consent is
18 deemed granted if:
19 (a) The holder, insurer or guarantor has not requested, in writing, notice of any
20 proposed amendment; or
21 (b) Notice of any proposed amendment is required or has been requested and a
22 written refusal to consent is not received by the association within 60 days after the

28 underwriting requirements of:
29 (a) Institutional lenders that regularly make loans secured by first mortgages
30 on units in common-interest communities or regularly purchase such mortgages;
31 or
32 (b) Insurance companies that issue insurance policies to associations or
33 units in a common-interest community.
34 Sec. 6. NRS 116.2118 is hereby amended to read as follows:
35 116.2118 1. Except in the case of a taking of all the units by eminent
36 domain, in the case of foreclosure against an entire cooperative of a security interest
37 that has priority over the declaration, or in the circumstances described in NRS
38 116.2124, a common-interest community may be terminated only by agreement of
39 units’ owners to whom at least 80 percent of the votes in the association are
40 allocated, [or any larger percentage the declaration specifies,] including at least 80
41 percent of the votes allocated to units that are not owned by the declarant, and
42 with any other approvals required by the declaration. The declaration may require
43 a larger percentage of the total votes in the association for approval, but
44 termination requires approval by at least 80 percent of the votes allocated to units
45 not owned by the declarant. The declaration may specify a smaller percentage only
46 if all of the units are restricted exclusively to nonresidential uses.
47 2. An agreement to terminate must be evidenced by the execution of an
48 agreement to terminate, or ratifications thereof, in the same manner as a deed, by
49 the requisite number of units’ owners. The agreement must specify a date after
50 which the agreement will be void unless it is recorded before that date. An
51 agreement to terminate and all ratifications thereof must be recorded in every

Senate Amendment No. 697 to Assembly Bill No. 396 First Reprint Page 10
1 3. In the case of a condominium or planned community containing only units
2 having horizontal boundaries described in the declaration, an agreement to
3 terminate may provide that all of the common elements and units of the common-
4 interest community must be sold following termination. If, pursuant to the
5 agreement, any real estate in the common-interest community is to be sold
6 following termination, the agreement must set forth the minimum terms of the sale.
7 4. In the case of a condominium or planned community containing any units
8 not having horizontal boundaries described in the declaration, an agreement to
9 terminate may provide for sale of the common elements, but it may not require that
10 the units be sold following termination, unless the declaration as originally recorded
11 provided otherwise or all the units’ owners consent to the sale.
12 5. The association, on behalf of the units’ owners, may contract for the sale of
13 real estate in a common-interest community, but the contract is not binding on the
14 units’ owners until approved pursuant to subsections 1 and 2. If any real estate is to
15 be sold following termination, title to that real estate, upon termination, vests in the
16 association as trustee for the holders of all interests in the units. Thereafter, the
17 association has all powers necessary and appropriate to effect the sale. Until the
18 sale has been concluded and the proceeds thereof distributed, the association
19 continues in existence with all powers it had before termination. Proceeds of the
20 sale must be distributed to units’ owners and lienholders as their interests may
21 appear, in accordance with NRS 116.21183 and 116.21185. Unless otherwise
22 specified in the agreement to terminate, as long as the association holds title to the
23 real estate, each unit’s owner and his or her successors in interest have an exclusive
24 right to occupancy of the portion of the real estate that formerly constituted the unit.
25 During the period of that occupancy, each unit’s owner and his or her successors in
26 interest remain liable for all assessments and other obligations imposed on units’
27 owners by this chapter or the declaration.
28 6. In a condominium or planned community, if the real estate constituting the
29 common-interest community is not to be sold following termination, title to the
30 common elements and, in a common-interest community containing only units
31 having horizontal boundaries described in the declaration, title to all the real estate
32 in the common-interest community, vests in the units’ owners upon termination as
33 tenants in common in proportion to their respective interests as provided in NRS
34 116.21185, and liens on the units shift accordingly. While the tenancy in common
35 exists, each unit’s owner and his or her successors in interest have an exclusive
36 right to occupancy of the portion of the real estate that formerly constituted the unit.
37 7. Following termination of the common-interest community, the proceeds of
38 a sale of real estate, together with the assets of the association, are held by the
39 association as trustee for units’ owners and holders of liens on the units as their
40 interests may appear.
41 Sec. 7. NRS 116.31065 is hereby amended to read as follows:
42 116.31065 The rules adopted by an association:
43 1. Must be reasonably related to the purpose for which they are adopted.
44 2. Must be sufficiently explicit in their prohibition, direction or limitation to
45 inform a person of any action or omission required for compliance.
46 3. Must not be adopted to evade any obligation of the association.
47 4. [Must] Except as otherwise provided in subsection 1 of NRS 116.335,
48 must be consistent with the governing documents of the association and must not
49 arbitrarily restrict conduct or require the construction of any capital improvement
50 by a unit’s owner that is not required by the governing documents of the
51 association.

Senate Amendment No. 697 to Assembly Bill No. 396 First Reprint Page 11
1 5. Must be uniformly enforced under the same or similar circumstances
2 against all units’ owners. Any rule that is not so uniformly enforced may not be
3 enforced against any unit’s owner.
4 6. May be enforced by the association through the imposition of a fine only if
5 the association complies with the requirements set forth in NRS 116.31031.
6 Sec. 8. NRS 116.335 is hereby amended to read as follows:
7 116.335 1. [Unless, at the time a unit’s owner purchased his or her unit,] If
8 the declaration [prohibited the unit’s owner from renting or leasing his or her unit,]
9 authorizes the association [may not] to prohibit or restrict the unit’s owner from
10 renting or leasing his or her unit [.] , or contains a provision establishing a
11 maximum number or percentage of units in the common-interest community
12 which may be rented or leased, the association may adopt rules and regulations to
13 prohibit or restrict the renting or leasing of residential units to the extent that the
14 restriction is reasonably related to meet underwriting requirements of:
15 (a) Institutional lenders that regularly make loans secured by first mortgages
16 on units in common-interest communities or regularly purchase such mortgages;
17 or
18 (b) Insurance companies that issue insurance policies to associations or
19 units in a common-interest community.
20 2. [Unless, at the time a unit’s owner purchased his or her unit, the declaration
21 required the unit’s owner to secure or obtain any approval from the association in
22 order to rent or lease his or her unit, an association may not require the unit’s owner
23 to secure or obtain any approval from the association in order to rent or lease his or
24 her unit.
25 3. If a declaration contains a provision establishing a maximum number or
26 percentage of units in the common-interest community which may be rented or
27 leased, that provision of the declaration may not be amended to decrease that
28 maximum number or percentage of units in the common-interest community which
29 may be rented or leased.
30 4. If the governing documents of an association require a unit’s owner who
31 leases or rents his or her unit, or the tenant of a unit’s owner, to register with the
32 association or its agent or otherwise submit to the association or its agent
33 information concerning the lease or rental agreement or the tenant, the association
34 or its agent:
35 (a) Must conduct such activities in accordance with the governing documents;
36 (b) May not require the unit’s owner or tenant of the unit’s owner to provide
37 information which the association or its agent does not require to be provided to the
38 association or its agent by a unit’s owner who occupies his or her unit, except that
39 the association or its agent may require the unit’s owner to provide a copy of the
40 lease or rental agreement; and
41 (c) May not charge a fee to the unit’s owner for the registration or submission
42 of information.
43 5.] The provisions of this section do not prohibit an association from
44 enforcing any provisions which govern the renting or leasing of units and which are
45 contained in this chapter or in any other applicable federal, state or local laws or
46 regulations [.
47 6.] , including, without limitation, any restriction on the rental of units as
48 transient lodging pursuant to NRS 244.35351 to 244.35359, inclusive, or
49 268.09791 to 268.09799, inclusive.
50 3. Notwithstanding any other provision of law or the declaration to the
51 contrary:
52 (a) If a unit’s owner is prohibited from renting or leasing a unit because the
53 maximum number or percentage of units which may be rented or leased in the

Senate Amendment No. 697 to Assembly Bill No. 396 First Reprint Page 12
1 common-interest community have already been rented or leased, the unit’s owner
2 may seek a waiver of the prohibition from the executive board based upon a
3 showing of economic hardship, and the executive board may grant such a waiver
4 and approve the renting or leasing of the unit.
5 (b) If the declaration contains a provision establishing a maximum number or
6 percentage of units in the common-interest community which may be rented or
7 leased, in determining the maximum number or percentage of units in the common-
8 interest community which may be rented or leased, the number of units owned by
9 the declarant must not be counted or considered.
10 Sec. 9. NRS 116.4109 is hereby amended to read as follows:
11 116.4109 1. Except in the case of a sale in which delivery of a public
12 offering statement is required, or unless exempt under subsection 2 of NRS
13 116.4101, a unit’s owner or his or her authorized agent shall, at the expense of the
14 unit’s owner, furnish to a purchaser a resale package containing all of the
15 following:
16 (a) A copy of the declaration, other than any plats, the bylaws, the rules or
17 regulations of the association and the information statement required by NRS
18 116.41095.
19 (b) A statement from the association setting forth the amount of the monthly
20 assessment for common expenses and any unpaid obligation of any kind, including,
21 without limitation, management fees, transfer fees, fines, penalties, interest,
22 collection costs, foreclosure fees and attorney’s fees currently due from the selling
23 unit’s owner.
24 (c) A copy of the current operating budget of the association and current year-
25 to-date financial statement for the association, which must include a summary of
26 the reserves of the association required by NRS 116.31152 and which must include,
27 without limitation, a summary of the information described in paragraphs (a) to (e),
28 inclusive, of subsection 3 of NRS 116.31152.
29 (d) A statement of any unsatisfied judgments or pending legal actions against
30 the association and the status of any pending legal actions relating to the common-
31 interest community of which the unit’s owner has actual knowledge.
32 (e) A statement of any transfer fees, transaction fees or any other fees
33 associated with the resale of a unit.
34 (f) In addition to any other document, a statement describing all current and
35 expected fees or charges for each unit, including, without limitation, association
36 fees, fines, assessments, late charges or penalties, interest rates on delinquent
37 assessments, additional costs for collecting past due fines and charges for opening
38 or closing any file for each unit.
39 (g) Proof of the insurance policies that an association is required to carry
40 pursuant to NRS 116.3113.
41 2. The purchaser may, by written notice, cancel the contract of purchase until
42 midnight of the fifth calendar day following the date of receipt of the resale
43 package described in subsection 1, and the contract for purchase must contain a
44 provision to that effect. If the purchaser elects to cancel a contract pursuant to this
45 subsection, the purchaser must hand deliver the notice of cancellation to the unit’s
46 owner or his or her authorized agent, mail the notice of cancellation by prepaid
47 United States mail to the unit’s owner or his or her authorized agent or deliver the
48 notice of cancellation by electronic transmission to the unit’s owner or his or her
49 authorized agent. Cancellation is without penalty, and all payments made by the
50 purchaser before cancellation must be refunded promptly. If the purchaser has
51 accepted a conveyance of the unit, the purchaser is not entitled to:
52 (a) Cancel the contract pursuant to this subsection; or

Senate Amendment No. 697 to Assembly Bill No. 396 First Reprint Page 13
1 (b) Damages, rescission or other relief based solely on the ground that the
2 unit’s owner or his or her authorized agent failed to furnish the resale package, or
3 any portion thereof, as required by this section.
4 3. Within 10 calendar days after receipt of a written request by a unit’s owner
5 or his or her authorized agent, the association shall furnish all of the following to
6 the unit’s owner or his or her authorized agent for inclusion in the resale package:
7 (a) Copies of the documents required pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (c) of
8 subsection 1; and
9 (b) A certificate containing the information necessary to enable the unit’s
10 owner to comply with paragraphs (b), (d), (e) , [and] (f) and (g) of subsection 1.
11 4. If the association furnishes the documents and certificate pursuant to
12 subsection 3:
13 (a) The unit’s owner or his or her authorized agent shall include the documents
14 and certificate in the resale package provided to the purchaser, and neither the
15 unit’s owner nor his or her authorized agent is liable to the purchaser for any
16 erroneous information provided by the association and included in the documents
17 and certificate.
18 (b) The association may charge the unit’s owner a reasonable fee to cover the
19 cost of preparing the certificate furnished pursuant to subsection 3. Such a fee must
20 be based on the actual cost the association incurs to fulfill the requirements of this
21 section in preparing the certificate and must not exceed $185, except that if a unit’s
22 owner or an authorized agent thereof requests that the certificate be furnished
23 sooner than 3 business days after the date of the request, the association may charge
24 a fee, which must not exceed $100, to expedite the preparation of the certificate.
25 The amount of the fee may increase, on an annual basis, by a percentage equal to
26 the percentage of increase in the Consumer Price Index (All Items) published by the
27 United States Department of Labor for the preceding calendar year, but must not
28 increase by more than 3 percent each year.
29 (c) The other documents furnished pursuant to subsection 3 must be provided
30 in electronic format to the unit’s owner. If the association is unable to provide such
31 documents in electronic format, the association may charge the unit’s owner a
32 reasonable fee, not to exceed 25 cents per page for the first 10 pages, and 10 cents
33 per page thereafter, to cover the cost of copying.
34 (d) Except for the fees allowed pursuant to paragraphs (b) and (c), the
35 association may not charge the unit’s owner any other fees for preparing or
36 furnishing the documents and certificate pursuant to subsection 3.
37 5. Neither a purchaser nor the purchaser’s interest in a unit is liable for any
38 unpaid assessment or fee greater than the amount set forth in the documents and
39 certificate prepared by the association. If the association fails to furnish the
40 documents and certificate within the 10 calendar days allowed by this section, the
41 purchaser is not liable for the delinquent assessment. A resale package provided to
42 a unit’s owner or his or her authorized agent pursuant to this section remains
43 effective for 90 calendar days.
44 6. Upon the request of a unit’s owner or his or her authorized agent, or upon
45 the request of a purchaser to whom the unit’s owner has provided a resale package
46 pursuant to this section or his or her authorized agent, the association shall make
47 the entire study of the reserves of the association which is required by NRS
48 116.31152 reasonably available for the unit’s owner, purchaser or authorized agent
49 to inspect, examine, photocopy and audit. The study must be made available at the
50 business office of the association or some other suitable location within the county
51 where the common-interest community is situated or, if it is situated in more than
52 one county, within one of those counties.

Senate Amendment No. 697 to Assembly Bill No. 396 First Reprint Page 14
1 7. A unit’s owner, the authorized agent of the unit’s owner or the holder of a
2 security interest on the unit may request a statement of demand from the
3 association. Not later than 10 calendar days after receipt of a written request from
4 the unit’s owner, the authorized agent of the unit’s owner or the holder of a security
5 interest on the unit for a statement of demand, the association shall furnish a
6 statement of demand to the person who requested the statement and provide a copy
7 of the statement to any other interested party. The association may charge a fee of
8 not more than $165 to prepare and furnish a statement of demand pursuant to this
9 subsection and an additional fee of not more than $100 to furnish a statement of
10 demand within 3 business days after receipt of a written request for a statement of
11 demand. The amount of the fees for preparing and furnishing a statement of
12 demand and the additional fee for furnishing a statement of demand within 3
13 business days may increase, on an annual basis, by a percentage equal to the
14 percentage of increase in the Consumer Price Index (All Items) published by the
15 United States Department of Labor for the preceding calendar year, but must not
16 increase by more than 3 percent each year. The statement of demand:
17 (a) Must set forth the amount of the monthly assessment for common expenses
18 and any unpaid obligation of any kind, including, without limitation, management
19 fees, transfer fees, fines, penalties, interest, collection costs, foreclosure fees and
20 attorney’s fees currently due from the selling unit’s owner; and
21 (b) Remains effective for the period specified in the statement of demand,
22 which must not be less than 15 business days after the date of delivery by the
23 association to the unit’s owner, the authorized agent of the unit’s owner or the
24 holder of a security interest on the unit, whichever is applicable.
25  As used in this subsection, “interested party” includes the unit’s owner selling
26 the unit and the prospective purchaser of the unit.
27 8. In preparing, copying, furnishing or expediting or otherwise providing any
28 document or other item pursuant to this section, an association, or entity related to
29 or acting on behalf of an association, shall not charge a unit’s owner, the authorized
30 agent of a unit’s owner, a purchaser or, pursuant to subsection 7, the holder of a
31 security interest on a unit, any fee:
32 (a) Not authorized in this section; or
33 (b) In an amount which exceeds any limit set forth in this section.
34 9. If the association becomes aware of an error in a statement of demand
35 furnished pursuant to subsection 7 during the period in which the statement of
36 demand is effective but before the consummation of a resale for which a resale
37 package was furnished pursuant to subsection 1, the association must deliver a
38 replacement statement of demand to the person who requested the statement of
39 demand. Unless the person who requested the statement of demand receives a
40 replacement statement of demand, the person may rely upon the accuracy of the
41 information set forth in the statement of demand provided by the association for the
42 resale. Payment of the amount set forth in the statement of demand constitutes full
43 payment of the amount due from the selling unit’s owner.
44 Sec. 10. NRS 116.785 is hereby amended to read as follows:
45 116.785 1. If the Commission or the hearing panel, after notice and hearing,
46 finds that the respondent has committed a violation, the Commission or the hearing
