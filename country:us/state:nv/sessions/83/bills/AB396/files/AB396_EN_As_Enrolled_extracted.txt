Section 1:
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to housing; requiring the governing body of
certain counties and cities to adopt an ordinance to authorize
the development and use of accessory dwelling units on
residential property; setting forth certain requirements for the
ordinance; providing that if the governing body of certain
counties and cities does not adopt such an ordinance by
July 1, 2026, accessory dwelling units are authorized on any
parcel zoned for residential use without restriction; revising
provisions relating to the amendment of a declaration or the
termination of a common-interest community; requiring
proof of certain insurance policies be furnished in a resale
package to a purchaser of a unit in a common-interest
community; increasing the fine that may be imposed by the
Commission for Common-Interest Communities and
Condominium Hotels for certain violations; making various
other changes relating to common-interest communities; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:

Section 2:
Section 10.5 of this bill declares that access to affordable housing is essential
for the residents of this State and that accessory dwelling units are vital to
increasing the supply of affordable housing.

Section 3:
Section 1 of this bill requires each governing body of a county whose
population is 100,000 or more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties) and each
governing body of a city whose population is 60,000 or more (currently the Cities
of Las Vegas, Henderson, North Las Vegas, Reno and Sparks) to adopt an
ordinance that authorizes the development and use of an accessory dwelling unit on
residential property. Section 1 provides that any such ordinance does not apply in a
region in a county or city for which there has been created by interstate compact a
regional planning agency and the regional plan adopted by the regional planning
agency calls for the regulation of housing. Section 1 further limits provisions of the
ordinance, including by prohibiting the ordinance from placing certain conditions
on the approval of the accessory dwelling unit.

Section 4:
Section 11 of this bill provides that: (1) if, before July 1, 2026, the governing
body of a county whose population is 100,000 or more or the governing body of a
city whose population is 60,000 or more has adopted an ordinance that is consistent
with section 1, the governing body is not required to adopt another ordinance
relating to accessory dwelling units pursuant to section 1; and (2) if the governing
body of a county whose population is 100,000 or more or the governing body of a
city whose population is 60,000 or more does not adopt an ordinance that is
consistent with section 1 before July 1, 2026, accessory dwelling units are
authorized on any parcel zoned for residential use without restriction.
Existing law authorizes the governing body of a county or city to divide the
county, city or region into zoning districts of such number, shape and area as are
best suited to carry out certain purposes. Within a zoning district, the governing
body is authorized to regulate and restrict the erection, reconstruction, alteration,
repair or use of buildings, structures or land. (NRS 278.250) Section 4 of this bill
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 2 –
creates an exception to account for the requirement that the governing body of
certain counties and cities adopt an ordinance to allow the addition of an accessory
dwelling unit pursuant to section 1.
Existing law requires that an action or proceeding seeking judicial relief or
review from or with respect to any final action, decision or order of any governing
body of a county or city be commenced within 25 days after the date of filing of
notice of the final action, decision or order with the clerk or secretary of the
governing body. (NRS 278.0235) Section 3 of this bill applies these provisions to

Section 5:
section 1.

Section 6:
Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to apply the definitions of
certain terms relating to planning and zoning to section 1.
Existing law sets forth certain requirements for the amendment of a declaration
of a common-interest community, including that every amendment to the
declaration must, with certain exceptions, be indexed in the grantee’s index in the
name of the common-interest community and the association and in the grantor’s
index in the name of the parties executing the amendment. (NRS 116.2117) Section
5 of this bill eliminates the exception for an amendment for the relocation of
boundaries between adjoining units. (NRS 116.2112)

Section 7:
Section 5 also authorizes an association to amend a declaration to restrict the
leasing of residential units to the extent that the restriction is reasonably designed to
meet certain underwriting requirements.
Existing law sets forth the requirements for terminating a common-interest
community. (NRS 116.2118) Section 6 of this bill amends the voting requirements
for terminating a common-interest community.

Section 8:
Sections 7 and 8 of this bill revise provisions relating to prohibiting or
restricting a unit owner from renting or leasing his or her unit.
Existing law requires a unit’s owner or his or her authorized agent, at the
expense of the unit’s owner, to furnish to a purchaser a resale package containing
certain information. (NRS 116.4109) Section 9 of this bill requires that a resale
package also contain proof of the insurance policies that an association is required
to carry.
Existing law authorizes, under certain circumstances, the Commission for
Common-Interest Communities and Condominium Hotels to impose an
administrative fine of not more than $1,000 for certain violations. (NRS 116.785)

Section 9:
Section 10 of this bill increases the administrative fine to not more than $5,000.

writing, notice of any proposed amendment; or
(b) Notice of any proposed amendment is required or has been
requested and a written refusal to consent is not received by the
association within 60 days after the association delivers notice of the
proposed amendment to the holder, insurer or guarantor, by certified
mail, return receipt requested, to the address for notice provided by
the holder, insurer or guarantor in a prior written request for notice.

Section 41:
9. An association may amend a declaration to restrict the
leasing of residential units to the extent that the restriction is
reasonably designed to meet underwriting requirements of:
(a) Institutional lenders that regularly make loans secured by
first mortgages on units in common-interest communities or
regularly purchase such mortgages; or
(b) Insurance companies that issue insurance policies to
associations or units in a common-interest community.
Sec. 6. NRS 116.2118 is hereby amended to read as follows:

Section 42:
116.2118 1. Except in the case of a taking of all the units by
eminent domain, in the case of foreclosure against an entire
cooperative of a security interest that has priority over the
declaration, or in the circumstances described in NRS 116.2124, a
common-interest community may be terminated only by agreement
of units’ owners to whom at least 80 percent of the votes in the
association are allocated, [or any larger percentage the declaration
specifies,] including at least 80 percent of the votes allocated to
units that are not owned by the declarant, and with any other
approvals required by the declaration. The declaration may require
a larger percentage of the total votes in the association for
approval, but termination requires approval by at least 80 percent
of the votes allocated to units not owned by the declarant. The
declaration may specify a smaller percentage only if all of the units
are restricted exclusively to nonresidential uses.

Section 43:
2. An agreement to terminate must be evidenced by the
execution of an agreement to terminate, or ratifications thereof, in
the same manner as a deed, by the requisite number of units’
owners. The agreement must specify a date after which the
agreement will be void unless it is recorded before that date. An
agreement to terminate and all ratifications thereof must be recorded
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 9 –
in every county in which a portion of the common-interest
community is situated and is effective only upon recordation.

Section 44:
3. In the case of a condominium or planned community
containing only units having horizontal boundaries described in the
declaration, an agreement to terminate may provide that all of the
common elements and units of the common-interest community
must be sold following termination. If, pursuant to the agreement,
any real estate in the common-interest community is to be sold
following termination, the agreement must set forth the minimum
terms of the sale.

Section 45:
4. In the case of a condominium or planned community
containing any units not having horizontal boundaries described in
the declaration, an agreement to terminate may provide for sale of
the common elements, but it may not require that the units be sold
following termination, unless the declaration as originally recorded
provided otherwise or all the units’ owners consent to the sale.

Section 46:
5. The association, on behalf of the units’ owners, may contract
for the sale of real estate in a common-interest community, but the
contract is not binding on the units’ owners until approved pursuant
to subsections 1 and 2. If any real estate is to be sold following
termination, title to that real estate, upon termination, vests in the
association as trustee for the holders of all interests in the units.
Thereafter, the association has all powers necessary and appropriate
to effect the sale. Until the sale has been concluded and the proceeds
thereof distributed, the association continues in existence with all
powers it had before termination. Proceeds of the sale must be
distributed to units’ owners and lienholders as their interests may
appear, in accordance with NRS 116.21183 and 116.21185. Unless
otherwise specified in the agreement to terminate, as long as the
association holds title to the real estate, each unit’s owner and his or
her successors in interest have an exclusive right to occupancy of
the portion of the real estate that formerly constituted the unit.
During the period of that occupancy, each unit’s owner and his or
her successors in interest remain liable for all assessments and other
obligations imposed on units’ owners by this chapter or the
declaration.

Section 47:
6. In a condominium or planned community, if the real estate
constituting the common-interest community is not to be sold
following termination, title to the common elements and, in a
common-interest community containing only units having
horizontal boundaries described in the declaration, title to all the real
estate in the common-interest community, vests in the units’ owners
upon termination as tenants in common in proportion to their
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 10 –
respective interests as provided in NRS 116.21185, and liens on the
units shift accordingly. While the tenancy in common exists, each
unit’s owner and his or her successors in interest have an exclusive
right to occupancy of the portion of the real estate that formerly
constituted the unit.

Section 48:
7. Following termination of the common-interest community,
the proceeds of a sale of real estate, together with the assets of the
association, are held by the association as trustee for units’ owners
and holders of liens on the units as their interests may appear.

Section 56:
116.335 1. [Unless, at the time a unit’s owner purchased his
or her unit,] If the declaration [prohibited the unit’s owner from
renting or leasing his or her unit,] authorizes the association [may
not] to prohibit or restrict the unit’s owner from renting or leasing
his or her unit [.] , or contains a provision establishing a maximum
number or percentage of units in the common-interest community
which may be rented or leased, the association may adopt rules
and regulations to prohibit or restrict the renting or leasing of
residential units to the extent that the restriction is reasonably
related to meet underwriting requirements of:

approval from the association in order to rent or lease his or her unit,

any approval from the association in order to rent or lease his or her
unit.

Section 58:
3. If a declaration contains a provision establishing a maximum
number or percentage of units in the common-interest community
which may be rented or leased, that provision of the declaration may
not be amended to decrease that maximum number or percentage of
units in the common-interest community which may be rented or
leased.

Section 59:
4. If the governing documents of an association require a unit’s
owner who leases or rents his or her unit, or the tenant of a unit’s

lease or rental agreement or the tenant, the association or its agent:
(a) Must conduct such activities in accordance with the
governing documents;
(b) May not require the unit’s owner or tenant of the unit’s
owner to provide information which the association or its agent does
not require to be provided to the association or its agent by a unit’s
owner who occupies his or her unit, except that the association or its
agent may require the unit’s owner to provide a copy of the lease or
rental agreement; and
(c) May not charge a fee to the unit’s owner for the registration
or submission of information.

Section 60:
5.] The provisions of this section do not prohibit an association
from enforcing any provisions which govern the renting or leasing
of units and which are contained in this chapter or in any other
applicable federal, state or local laws or regulations [.

Section 61:

Section 63:
3. Notwithstanding any other provision of law or the
declaration to the contrary:
(a) If a unit’s owner is prohibited from renting or leasing a unit

rented or leased in the common-interest community have already
been rented or leased, the unit’s owner may seek a waiver of the
prohibition from the executive board based upon a showing of
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 12 –
economic hardship, and the executive board may grant such a
waiver and approve the renting or leasing of the unit.
(b) If the declaration contains a provision establishing a
maximum number or percentage of units in the common-interest
community which may be rented or leased, in determining the
maximum number or percentage of units in the common-interest
community which may be rented or leased, the number of units
owned by the declarant must not be counted or considered.

Section 65:
2. The purchaser may, by written notice, cancel the contract of
purchase until midnight of the fifth calendar day following the date
of receipt of the resale package described in subsection 1, and the
contract for purchase must contain a provision to that effect. If the
purchaser elects to cancel a contract pursuant to this subsection,
the purchaser must hand deliver the notice of cancellation to the
unit’s owner or his or her authorized agent, mail the notice of
cancellation by prepaid United States mail to the unit’s owner or his
or her authorized agent or deliver the notice of cancellation by
electronic transmission to the unit’s owner or his or her authorized
agent. Cancellation is without penalty, and all payments made by
the purchaser before cancellation must be refunded promptly. If the
purchaser has accepted a conveyance of the unit, the purchaser is
not entitled to:
(a) Cancel the contract pursuant to this subsection; or
(b) Damages, rescission or other relief based solely on the
ground that the unit’s owner or his or her authorized agent failed to
furnish the resale package, or any portion thereof, as required by this

Section 66:
section.

Section 67:
3. Within 10 calendar days after receipt of a written request by
a unit’s owner or his or her authorized agent, the association shall
furnish all of the following to the unit’s owner or his or her
authorized agent for inclusion in the resale package:
(a) Copies of the documents required pursuant to paragraphs (a)
and (c) of subsection 1; and
(b) A certificate containing the information necessary to enable
the unit’s owner to comply with paragraphs (b), (d), (e) , [and] (f)
and (g) of subsection 1.

Section 68:
4. If the association furnishes the documents and certificate
pursuant to subsection 3:
(a) The unit’s owner or his or her authorized agent shall include
the documents and certificate in the resale package provided to the
purchaser, and neither the unit’s owner nor his or her authorized
agent is liable to the purchaser for any erroneous information
provided by the association and included in the documents and
certificate.
(b) The association may charge the unit’s owner a reasonable
fee to cover the cost of preparing the certificate furnished pursuant
to subsection 3. Such a fee must be based on the actual cost the
association incurs to fulfill the requirements of this section in
preparing the certificate and must not exceed $185, except that if a
unit’s owner or an authorized agent thereof requests that the
certificate be furnished sooner than 3 business days after the date of
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 14 –
the request, the association may charge a fee, which must not exceed
$100, to expedite the preparation of the certificate. The amount of
the fee may increase, on an annual basis, by a percentage equal to
the percentage of increase in the Consumer Price Index (All Items)
published by the United States Department of Labor for the
preceding calendar year, but must not increase by more than 3
percent each year.
(c) The other documents furnished pursuant to subsection 3
must be provided in electronic format to the unit’s owner. If the
association is unable to provide such documents in electronic
format, the association may charge the unit’s owner a reasonable
fee, not to exceed 25 cents per page for the first 10 pages, and 10
cents per page thereafter, to cover the cost of copying.
(d) Except for the fees allowed pursuant to paragraphs (b) and
(c), the association may not charge the unit’s owner any other fees
for preparing or furnishing the documents and certificate pursuant to
subsection 3.

Section 69:
5. Neither a purchaser nor the purchaser’s interest in a unit is
liable for any unpaid assessment or fee greater than the amount set
forth in the documents and certificate prepared by the association. If
the association fails to furnish the documents and certificate within
the 10 calendar days allowed by this section, the purchaser is not
liable for the delinquent assessment. A resale package provided to a
unit’s owner or his or her authorized agent pursuant to this section
remains effective for 90 calendar days.

Section 70:
6. Upon the request of a unit’s owner or his or her authorized
agent, or upon the request of a purchaser to whom the unit’s owner
has provided a resale package pursuant to this section or his or her
authorized agent, the association shall make the entire study of the
reserves of the association which is required by NRS 116.31152
reasonably available for the unit’s owner, purchaser or authorized
agent to inspect, examine, photocopy and audit. The study must be
made available at the business office of the association or some
other suitable location within the county where the common-interest
community is situated or, if it is situated in more than one county,
within one of those counties.

Section 71:
7. A unit’s owner, the authorized agent of the unit’s owner or
the holder of a security interest on the unit may request a statement
of demand from the association. Not later than 10 calendar days
after receipt of a written request from the unit’s owner, the
authorized agent of the unit’s owner or the holder of a security
interest on the unit for a statement of demand, the association shall
furnish a statement of demand to the person who requested the
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 15 –
statement and provide a copy of the statement to any other interested
party. The association may charge a fee of not more than $165 to
prepare and furnish a statement of demand pursuant to this
subsection and an additional fee of not more than $100 to furnish a
statement of demand within 3 business days after receipt of a written
request for a statement of demand. The amount of the fees for
preparing and furnishing a statement of demand and the additional
fee for furnishing a statement of demand within 3 business days may
increase, on an annual basis, by a percentage equal to the percentage
of increase in the Consumer Price Index (All Items) published by
the United States Department of Labor for the preceding calendar
year, but must not increase by more than 3 percent each year. The
statement of demand:
(a) Must set forth the amount of the monthly assessment for
common expenses and any unpaid obligation of any kind, including,
without limitation, management fees, transfer fees, fines, penalties,
interest, collection costs, foreclosure fees and attorney’s fees
currently due from the selling unit’s owner; and
(b) Remains effective for the period specified in the statement of
demand, which must not be less than 15 business days after the date
of delivery by the association to the unit’s owner, the authorized
agent of the unit’s owner or the holder of a security interest on the
unit, whichever is applicable.
 As used in this subsection, “interested party” includes the unit’s
owner selling the unit and the prospective purchaser of the unit.

Section 72:
8. In preparing, copying, furnishing or expediting or otherwise
providing any document or other item pursuant to this section, an
association, or entity related to or acting on behalf of an association,
shall not charge a unit’s owner, the authorized agent of a unit’s
owner, a purchaser or, pursuant to subsection 7, the holder of a
security interest on a unit, any fee:
(a) Not authorized in this section; or
(b) In an amount which exceeds any limit set forth in this

Section 73:
section.

Section 74:
9. If the association becomes aware of an error in a statement
of demand furnished pursuant to subsection 7 during the period in
which the statement of demand is effective but before the
consummation of a resale for which a resale package was furnished
pursuant to subsection 1, the association must deliver a replacement
statement of demand to the person who requested the statement of
demand. Unless the person who requested the statement of demand
receives a replacement statement of demand, the person may rely
upon the accuracy of the information set forth in the statement of
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 16 –
demand provided by the association for the resale. Payment of the
amount set forth in the statement of demand constitutes full payment
of the amount due from the selling unit’s owner.

Raw Text:
Assembly Bill No. 396–Assemblymember Backus
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to housing; requiring the governing body of
certain counties and cities to adopt an ordinance to authorize
the development and use of accessory dwelling units on
residential property; setting forth certain requirements for the
ordinance; providing that if the governing body of certain
counties and cities does not adopt such an ordinance by
July 1, 2026, accessory dwelling units are authorized on any
parcel zoned for residential use without restriction; revising
provisions relating to the amendment of a declaration or the
termination of a common-interest community; requiring
proof of certain insurance policies be furnished in a resale
package to a purchaser of a unit in a common-interest
community; increasing the fine that may be imposed by the
Commission for Common-Interest Communities and
Condominium Hotels for certain violations; making various
other changes relating to common-interest communities; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Section 10.5 of this bill declares that access to affordable housing is essential
for the residents of this State and that accessory dwelling units are vital to
increasing the supply of affordable housing.
Section 1 of this bill requires each governing body of a county whose
population is 100,000 or more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties) and each
governing body of a city whose population is 60,000 or more (currently the Cities
of Las Vegas, Henderson, North Las Vegas, Reno and Sparks) to adopt an
ordinance that authorizes the development and use of an accessory dwelling unit on
residential property. Section 1 provides that any such ordinance does not apply in a
region in a county or city for which there has been created by interstate compact a
regional planning agency and the regional plan adopted by the regional planning
agency calls for the regulation of housing. Section 1 further limits provisions of the
ordinance, including by prohibiting the ordinance from placing certain conditions
on the approval of the accessory dwelling unit.
Section 11 of this bill provides that: (1) if, before July 1, 2026, the governing
body of a county whose population is 100,000 or more or the governing body of a
city whose population is 60,000 or more has adopted an ordinance that is consistent
with section 1, the governing body is not required to adopt another ordinance
relating to accessory dwelling units pursuant to section 1; and (2) if the governing
body of a county whose population is 100,000 or more or the governing body of a
city whose population is 60,000 or more does not adopt an ordinance that is
consistent with section 1 before July 1, 2026, accessory dwelling units are
authorized on any parcel zoned for residential use without restriction.
Existing law authorizes the governing body of a county or city to divide the
county, city or region into zoning districts of such number, shape and area as are
best suited to carry out certain purposes. Within a zoning district, the governing
body is authorized to regulate and restrict the erection, reconstruction, alteration,
repair or use of buildings, structures or land. (NRS 278.250) Section 4 of this bill
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 2 –
creates an exception to account for the requirement that the governing body of
certain counties and cities adopt an ordinance to allow the addition of an accessory
dwelling unit pursuant to section 1.
Existing law requires that an action or proceeding seeking judicial relief or
review from or with respect to any final action, decision or order of any governing
body of a county or city be commenced within 25 days after the date of filing of
notice of the final action, decision or order with the clerk or secretary of the
governing body. (NRS 278.0235) Section 3 of this bill applies these provisions to
section 1.
Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to apply the definitions of
certain terms relating to planning and zoning to section 1.
Existing law sets forth certain requirements for the amendment of a declaration
of a common-interest community, including that every amendment to the
declaration must, with certain exceptions, be indexed in the grantee’s index in the
name of the common-interest community and the association and in the grantor’s
index in the name of the parties executing the amendment. (NRS 116.2117) Section
5 of this bill eliminates the exception for an amendment for the relocation of
boundaries between adjoining units. (NRS 116.2112)
Section 5 also authorizes an association to amend a declaration to restrict the
leasing of residential units to the extent that the restriction is reasonably designed to
meet certain underwriting requirements.
Existing law sets forth the requirements for terminating a common-interest
community. (NRS 116.2118) Section 6 of this bill amends the voting requirements
for terminating a common-interest community.
Sections 7 and 8 of this bill revise provisions relating to prohibiting or
restricting a unit owner from renting or leasing his or her unit.
Existing law requires a unit’s owner or his or her authorized agent, at the
expense of the unit’s owner, to furnish to a purchaser a resale package containing
certain information. (NRS 116.4109) Section 9 of this bill requires that a resale
package also contain proof of the insurance policies that an association is required
to carry.
Existing law authorizes, under certain circumstances, the Commission for
Common-Interest Communities and Condominium Hotels to impose an
administrative fine of not more than $1,000 for certain violations. (NRS 116.785)
Section 10 of this bill increases the administrative fine to not more than $5,000.
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.

construction of an additional dwelling unit by building permit in
lieu of approval by the planning department of the county or city;
or
(b) Authorize more than two accessory dwelling units on any
residential property.
5. Any ordinance adopted pursuant to this section does not
apply in a region in a county or city in this State for which there
has been created by interstate compact a regional planning agency
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 4 –
and the regional plan adopted by the regional planning agency
calls for the regulation of housing.
6. As used in this section:

space that is built on the same lot as the primary residence on a
residential property, regardless of whether the independent living
space is attached, detached or built within the primary residence.
(b) “Kitchen facilities” includes, without limitation, a sink,
refrigerator and a significant cooking appliance such as a range,
stove or oven.
(c) “Residential property” means a property that is located in
an area of the county or city, as applicable, zoned for single-family
residential use.
Sec. 2. NRS 278.010 is hereby amended to read as follows:
278.010 As used in NRS 278.010 to 278.630, inclusive, and
section 1 of this act, unless the context otherwise requires, the

executed by a declarant under subsection 5 of NRS 116.2109 or
NRS 116.211, or by the association under NRS 116.1107, 116.2106,
subsection 3 of NRS 116.2108, subsection 1 of NRS 116.2112 or

– 7 –
NRS 116.2113, or by certain units’ owners under subsection 2 of
NRS 116.2108, subsection 1 of NRS 116.2112, subsection 2 of NRS
116.2113 or subsection 2 of NRS 116.2118, and except as otherwise
limited by subsections 4, 6, 7 and 8, the declaration, including any
plats, may be amended only by vote or agreement of units’ owners
of units to which at least a majority of the votes in the association
are allocated, unless the declaration specifies a different percentage
for all amendments or for specified subjects of amendment. If the
declaration requires the approval of another person as a condition of
its effectiveness, the amendment is not valid without that approval.
2. No action to challenge the validity of an amendment adopted
by the association pursuant to this section may be brought more than
1 year after the amendment is recorded.
3. Every amendment to the declaration must be recorded in
every county in which any portion of the common-interest
community is located and is effective only upon recordation. An
amendment [, except an amendment pursuant to NRS 116.2112,]
must be indexed in the grantee’s index in the name of the common-
interest community and the association and in the grantor’s index in
the name of the parties executing the amendment.
4. Except to the extent expressly permitted or required by other
provisions of this chapter, no amendment may change the
boundaries of any unit or change the allocated interests of a unit in
the absence of unanimous consent of only those units’ owners
whose units are affected and the consent of a majority of the owners
of the remaining units [.] , including a majority of the votes
allocated to units not owned by the declarant.
5. Amendments to the declaration required by this chapter to
be recorded by the association must be prepared, executed, recorded
and certified on behalf of the association by any officer of the
association designated for that purpose or, in the absence of
designation, by the president of the association.
6. [An] Except as otherwise provided in subsection 9, an
amendment to the declaration which prohibits or materially restricts
the permitted uses of a unit or the number or other qualifications of
persons who may occupy units may not be enforced against a unit’s
owner who was the owner of the unit on the date of the recordation
of the amendment as long as the unit’s owner remains the owner of
that unit.
7. A provision in the declaration creating special declarant’s
rights that have not expired may not be amended without the
consent of the declarant.
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 8 –
8. If any provision of this chapter or of the declaration requires
the consent of a holder of a security interest in a unit, or an insurer
or guarantor of such interest, as a condition to the effectiveness of
an amendment to the declaration, that consent is deemed granted if:
(a) The holder, insurer or guarantor has not requested, in
writing, notice of any proposed amendment; or
(b) Notice of any proposed amendment is required or has been
requested and a written refusal to consent is not received by the
association within 60 days after the association delivers notice of the
proposed amendment to the holder, insurer or guarantor, by certified
mail, return receipt requested, to the address for notice provided by
the holder, insurer or guarantor in a prior written request for notice.
9. An association may amend a declaration to restrict the
leasing of residential units to the extent that the restriction is
reasonably designed to meet underwriting requirements of:
(a) Institutional lenders that regularly make loans secured by
first mortgages on units in common-interest communities or
regularly purchase such mortgages; or
(b) Insurance companies that issue insurance policies to
associations or units in a common-interest community.
Sec. 6. NRS 116.2118 is hereby amended to read as follows:
116.2118 1. Except in the case of a taking of all the units by
eminent domain, in the case of foreclosure against an entire
cooperative of a security interest that has priority over the
declaration, or in the circumstances described in NRS 116.2124, a
common-interest community may be terminated only by agreement
of units’ owners to whom at least 80 percent of the votes in the
association are allocated, [or any larger percentage the declaration
specifies,] including at least 80 percent of the votes allocated to
units that are not owned by the declarant, and with any other
approvals required by the declaration. The declaration may require
a larger percentage of the total votes in the association for
approval, but termination requires approval by at least 80 percent
of the votes allocated to units not owned by the declarant. The
declaration may specify a smaller percentage only if all of the units
are restricted exclusively to nonresidential uses.
2. An agreement to terminate must be evidenced by the
execution of an agreement to terminate, or ratifications thereof, in
the same manner as a deed, by the requisite number of units’
owners. The agreement must specify a date after which the
agreement will be void unless it is recorded before that date. An
agreement to terminate and all ratifications thereof must be recorded
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 9 –
in every county in which a portion of the common-interest
community is situated and is effective only upon recordation.
3. In the case of a condominium or planned community
containing only units having horizontal boundaries described in the
declaration, an agreement to terminate may provide that all of the
common elements and units of the common-interest community
must be sold following termination. If, pursuant to the agreement,
any real estate in the common-interest community is to be sold
following termination, the agreement must set forth the minimum
terms of the sale.
4. In the case of a condominium or planned community
containing any units not having horizontal boundaries described in
the declaration, an agreement to terminate may provide for sale of
the common elements, but it may not require that the units be sold
following termination, unless the declaration as originally recorded
provided otherwise or all the units’ owners consent to the sale.
5. The association, on behalf of the units’ owners, may contract
for the sale of real estate in a common-interest community, but the
contract is not binding on the units’ owners until approved pursuant
to subsections 1 and 2. If any real estate is to be sold following
termination, title to that real estate, upon termination, vests in the
association as trustee for the holders of all interests in the units.
Thereafter, the association has all powers necessary and appropriate
to effect the sale. Until the sale has been concluded and the proceeds
thereof distributed, the association continues in existence with all
powers it had before termination. Proceeds of the sale must be
distributed to units’ owners and lienholders as their interests may
appear, in accordance with NRS 116.21183 and 116.21185. Unless
otherwise specified in the agreement to terminate, as long as the
association holds title to the real estate, each unit’s owner and his or
her successors in interest have an exclusive right to occupancy of
the portion of the real estate that formerly constituted the unit.
During the period of that occupancy, each unit’s owner and his or
her successors in interest remain liable for all assessments and other
obligations imposed on units’ owners by this chapter or the
declaration.
6. In a condominium or planned community, if the real estate
constituting the common-interest community is not to be sold
following termination, title to the common elements and, in a
common-interest community containing only units having
horizontal boundaries described in the declaration, title to all the real
estate in the common-interest community, vests in the units’ owners
upon termination as tenants in common in proportion to their
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 10 –
respective interests as provided in NRS 116.21185, and liens on the
units shift accordingly. While the tenancy in common exists, each
unit’s owner and his or her successors in interest have an exclusive
right to occupancy of the portion of the real estate that formerly
constituted the unit.
7. Following termination of the common-interest community,
the proceeds of a sale of real estate, together with the assets of the
association, are held by the association as trustee for units’ owners
and holders of liens on the units as their interests may appear.
Sec. 7. NRS 116.31065 is hereby amended to read as follows:
116.31065 The rules adopted by an association:
1. Must be reasonably related to the purpose for which they are
adopted.
2. Must be sufficiently explicit in their prohibition, direction or
limitation to inform a person of any action or omission required for
compliance.
3. Must not be adopted to evade any obligation of the
association.
4. [Must] Except as otherwise provided in subsection 1 of
NRS 116.335, must be consistent with the governing documents of
the association and must not arbitrarily restrict conduct or require
the construction of any capital improvement by a unit’s owner that
is not required by the governing documents of the association.
5. Must be uniformly enforced under the same or similar
circumstances against all units’ owners. Any rule that is not so
uniformly enforced may not be enforced against any unit’s owner.
6. May be enforced by the association through the imposition
of a fine only if the association complies with the requirements set
forth in NRS 116.31031.
Sec. 8. NRS 116.335 is hereby amended to read as follows:
116.335 1. [Unless, at the time a unit’s owner purchased his
or her unit,] If the declaration [prohibited the unit’s owner from
renting or leasing his or her unit,] authorizes the association [may
not] to prohibit or restrict the unit’s owner from renting or leasing
his or her unit [.] , or contains a provision establishing a maximum
number or percentage of units in the common-interest community
which may be rented or leased, the association may adopt rules
and regulations to prohibit or restrict the renting or leasing of
residential units to the extent that the restriction is reasonably
related to meet underwriting requirements of:
(a) Institutional lenders that regularly make loans secured by
first mortgages on units in common-interest communities or
regularly purchase such mortgages; or
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 11 –
(b) Insurance companies that issue insurance policies to
associations or units in a common-interest community.
2. [Unless, at the time a unit’s owner purchased his or her unit,
the declaration required the unit’s owner to secure or obtain any
approval from the association in order to rent or lease his or her unit,
an association may not require the unit’s owner to secure or obtain
any approval from the association in order to rent or lease his or her
unit.
3. If a declaration contains a provision establishing a maximum
number or percentage of units in the common-interest community
which may be rented or leased, that provision of the declaration may
not be amended to decrease that maximum number or percentage of
units in the common-interest community which may be rented or
leased.
4. If the governing documents of an association require a unit’s
owner who leases or rents his or her unit, or the tenant of a unit’s
owner, to register with the association or its agent or otherwise
submit to the association or its agent information concerning the
lease or rental agreement or the tenant, the association or its agent:
(a) Must conduct such activities in accordance with the
governing documents;
(b) May not require the unit’s owner or tenant of the unit’s
owner to provide information which the association or its agent does
not require to be provided to the association or its agent by a unit’s
owner who occupies his or her unit, except that the association or its
agent may require the unit’s owner to provide a copy of the lease or
rental agreement; and
(c) May not charge a fee to the unit’s owner for the registration
or submission of information.
5.] The provisions of this section do not prohibit an association
from enforcing any provisions which govern the renting or leasing
of units and which are contained in this chapter or in any other
applicable federal, state or local laws or regulations [.
6.] , including, without limitation, any restriction on the rental
of units as transient lodging pursuant to NRS 244.35351 to
244.35359, inclusive, or 268.09791 to 268.09799, inclusive.
3. Notwithstanding any other provision of law or the
declaration to the contrary:
(a) If a unit’s owner is prohibited from renting or leasing a unit
because the maximum number or percentage of units which may be
rented or leased in the common-interest community have already
been rented or leased, the unit’s owner may seek a waiver of the
prohibition from the executive board based upon a showing of
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 12 –
economic hardship, and the executive board may grant such a
waiver and approve the renting or leasing of the unit.
(b) If the declaration contains a provision establishing a
maximum number or percentage of units in the common-interest
community which may be rented or leased, in determining the
maximum number or percentage of units in the common-interest
community which may be rented or leased, the number of units
owned by the declarant must not be counted or considered.
Sec. 9. NRS 116.4109 is hereby amended to read as follows:
116.4109 1. Except in the case of a sale in which delivery of
a public offering statement is required, or unless exempt under
subsection 2 of NRS 116.4101, a unit’s owner or his or her
authorized agent shall, at the expense of the unit’s owner, furnish to
a purchaser a resale package containing all of the following:

2. The purchaser may, by written notice, cancel the contract of
purchase until midnight of the fifth calendar day following the date
of receipt of the resale package described in subsection 1, and the
contract for purchase must contain a provision to that effect. If the
purchaser elects to cancel a contract pursuant to this subsection,
the purchaser must hand deliver the notice of cancellation to the
unit’s owner or his or her authorized agent, mail the notice of
cancellation by prepaid United States mail to the unit’s owner or his
or her authorized agent or deliver the notice of cancellation by
electronic transmission to the unit’s owner or his or her authorized
agent. Cancellation is without penalty, and all payments made by
the purchaser before cancellation must be refunded promptly. If the
purchaser has accepted a conveyance of the unit, the purchaser is
not entitled to:
(a) Cancel the contract pursuant to this subsection; or
(b) Damages, rescission or other relief based solely on the
ground that the unit’s owner or his or her authorized agent failed to
furnish the resale package, or any portion thereof, as required by this
section.

a unit’s owner or his or her authorized agent, the association shall

(a) The unit’s owner or his or her authorized agent shall include
the documents and certificate in the resale package provided to the
purchaser, and neither the unit’s owner nor his or her authorized
agent is liable to the purchaser for any erroneous information
provided by the association and included in the documents and
certificate.
(b) The association may charge the unit’s owner a reasonable
fee to cover the cost of preparing the certificate furnished pursuant
to subsection 3. Such a fee must be based on the actual cost the
association incurs to fulfill the requirements of this section in
preparing the certificate and must not exceed $185, except that if a
unit’s owner or an authorized agent thereof requests that the
certificate be furnished sooner than 3 business days after the date of
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 14 –
the request, the association may charge a fee, which must not exceed
$100, to expedite the preparation of the certificate. The amount of
the fee may increase, on an annual basis, by a percentage equal to
the percentage of increase in the Consumer Price Index (All Items)
published by the United States Department of Labor for the
preceding calendar year, but must not increase by more than 3
percent each year.
(c) The other documents furnished pursuant to subsection 3
must be provided in electronic format to the unit’s owner. If the

liable for any unpaid assessment or fee greater than the amount set
forth in the documents and certificate prepared by the association. If
the association fails to furnish the documents and certificate within
the 10 calendar days allowed by this section, the purchaser is not
liable for the delinquent assessment. A resale package provided to a
unit’s owner or his or her authorized agent pursuant to this section
remains effective for 90 calendar days.
6. Upon the request of a unit’s owner or his or her authorized
agent, or upon the request of a purchaser to whom the unit’s owner
has provided a resale package pursuant to this section or his or her
authorized agent, the association shall make the entire study of the
reserves of the association which is required by NRS 116.31152
reasonably available for the unit’s owner, purchaser or authorized
agent to inspect, examine, photocopy and audit. The study must be
made available at the business office of the association or some
other suitable location within the county where the common-interest
community is situated or, if it is situated in more than one county,
within one of those counties.
7. A unit’s owner, the authorized agent of the unit’s owner or
the holder of a security interest on the unit may request a statement
of demand from the association. Not later than 10 calendar days
after receipt of a written request from the unit’s owner, the
authorized agent of the unit’s owner or the holder of a security
interest on the unit for a statement of demand, the association shall
furnish a statement of demand to the person who requested the
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 15 –
statement and provide a copy of the statement to any other interested
party. The association may charge a fee of not more than $165 to
prepare and furnish a statement of demand pursuant to this
subsection and an additional fee of not more than $100 to furnish a
statement of demand within 3 business days after receipt of a written
request for a statement of demand. The amount of the fees for
preparing and furnishing a statement of demand and the additional
fee for furnishing a statement of demand within 3 business days may
increase, on an annual basis, by a percentage equal to the percentage
of increase in the Consumer Price Index (All Items) published by
the United States Department of Labor for the preceding calendar
year, but must not increase by more than 3 percent each year. The
statement of demand:
(a) Must set forth the amount of the monthly assessment for
common expenses and any unpaid obligation of any kind, including,
without limitation, management fees, transfer fees, fines, penalties,
interest, collection costs, foreclosure fees and attorney’s fees

(b) Remains effective for the period specified in the statement of
demand, which must not be less than 15 business days after the date
of delivery by the association to the unit’s owner, the authorized
agent of the unit’s owner or the holder of a security interest on the
unit, whichever is applicable.
 As used in this subsection, “interested party” includes the unit’s
owner selling the unit and the prospective purchaser of the unit.
8. In preparing, copying, furnishing or expediting or otherwise
providing any document or other item pursuant to this section, an
association, or entity related to or acting on behalf of an association,
shall not charge a unit’s owner, the authorized agent of a unit’s
owner, a purchaser or, pursuant to subsection 7, the holder of a
security interest on a unit, any fee:
(a) Not authorized in this section; or
(b) In an amount which exceeds any limit set forth in this
section.
9. If the association becomes aware of an error in a statement
of demand furnished pursuant to subsection 7 during the period in
which the statement of demand is effective but before the
consummation of a resale for which a resale package was furnished
pursuant to subsection 1, the association must deliver a replacement
statement of demand to the person who requested the statement of
demand. Unless the person who requested the statement of demand
receives a replacement statement of demand, the person may rely
upon the accuracy of the information set forth in the statement of
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 16 –
demand provided by the association for the resale. Payment of the
amount set forth in the statement of demand constitutes full payment
of the amount due from the selling unit’s owner.
