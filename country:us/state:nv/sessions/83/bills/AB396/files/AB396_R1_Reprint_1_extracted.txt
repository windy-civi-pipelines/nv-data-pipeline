Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Section 1 of this bill requires each governing body of a county whose
2 population is 100,000 or more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties) and each
3 governing body of a city whose population is 60,000 or more (currently the Cities
4 of Las Vegas, Henderson, North Las Vegas, Reno and Sparks) to adopt an
-
*AB396_R1*
– 2 –
5 ordinance that authorizes the owner of a residential property to apply to add an
6 accessory dwelling unit to the residential property. Section 1 provides that any such
7 ordinance does not apply in a region in a county or city for which there has been
8 created by interstate compact a regional planning agency and the regional plan
9 adopted by the regional planning agency calls for the regulation of housing. Section
10 1 further requires the ordinance to authorize, under certain circumstances, an
11 additional accessory dwelling unit to the residential property. Section 1 also sets
12 forth various requirements for the ordinance, including that the ordinance set forth
13 an expedited process for the approval of the application and any appeal of the
14 denial of such an application. Section 1 further limits provisions of the ordinance,
15 including by prohibiting the ordinance from placing certain conditions on the
16 approval of the accessory dwelling unit.
17 Section 11 of this bill provides that: (1) if, before January 1, 2026, the
18 governing body of a county whose population is 100,000 or more or the governing
19 body of a city whose population is 60,000 or more has adopted an ordinance that is
20 consistent with section 1, the governing body is not required to adopt another
21 ordinance relating to accessory dwelling units pursuant to section 1; and (2) if the
22 governing body of a county whose population is 100,000 or more or the governing
23 body of a city whose population is 60,000 or more does not adopt an ordinance that
24 is consistent with section 1 before January 1, 2026, accessory dwelling units are
25 authorized on any parcel zoned for residential use without restriction.
26 Existing law authorizes the governing body of a county or city to divide the
27 county, city or region into zoning districts of such number, shape and area as are
28 best suited to carry out certain purposes. Within a zoning district, the governing
29 body is authorized to regulate and restrict the erection, reconstruction, alteration,
30 repair or use of buildings, structures or land. (NRS 278.250) Section 4 of this bill
31 creates an exception to account for the requirement that the governing body of
32 certain counties and cities adopt an ordinance to allow the addition of an accessory
33 dwelling unit pursuant to section 1.
34 Existing law requires that an action or proceeding seeking judicial relief or
35 review from or with respect to any final action, decision or order of any governing
36 body of a county or city be commenced within 25 days after the date of filing of
37 notice of the final action, decision or order with the clerk or secretary of the
38 governing body. (NRS 278.0235) Section 3 of this bill applies these provisions to
39 section 1.
40 Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to apply the definitions of
41 certain terms relating to planning and zoning to section 1.
42 Existing law sets forth certain requirements for the amendment of a declaration
43 of a common-interest community, including that every amendment to the
44 declaration must, with certain exceptions, be indexed in the grantee’s index in the
45 name of the common-interest community and the association and in the grantor’s
46 index in the name of the parties executing the amendment. (NRS 116.2117) Section
47 5 of this bill eliminates the exception for an amendment for the relocation of
48 boundaries between adjoining units. (NRS 116.2112)
49 Section 5 also authorizes an association to amend a declaration to restrict the
50 leasing of residential units to the extent that the restriction is reasonably designed to
51 meet certain underwriting requirements.
52 Existing law sets forth the requirements for terminating a common-interest
53 community. (NRS 116.2118) Section 6 of this bill amends the voting requirements
54 for terminating a common-interest community.
55 Sections 7 and 8 of this bill revise provisions relating to prohibiting or
56 restricting a unit owner from renting or leasing his or her unit.
57 Existing law requires a unit’s owner or his or her authorized agent, at the
58 expense of the unit’s owner, to furnish to a purchaser a resale package containing
59 certain information. (NRS 116.4109) Section 9 of this bill requires that a resale
-
*AB396_R1*
– 3 –
60 package also contain proof of the insurance policies that an association is required
61 to carry.
62 Existing law authorizes, under certain circumstances, the Commission for
63 Common-Interest Communities and Condominium Hotels to impose an
64 administrative fine of not more than $1,000 for certain violations. (NRS 116.785)
65 Section 10 of this bill increases the administrative fine to not more than $5,000.

45 NRS 116.211, or by the association under NRS 116.1107, 116.2106,
-
*AB396_R1*
– 8 –
1 subsection 3 of NRS 116.2108, subsection 1 of NRS 116.2112 or
2 NRS 116.2113, or by certain units’ owners under subsection 2 of
3 NRS 116.2108, subsection 1 of NRS 116.2112, subsection 2 of NRS
4 116.2113 or subsection 2 of NRS 116.2118, and except as otherwise
5 limited by subsections 4, 6, 7 and 8, the declaration, including any
6 plats, may be amended only by vote or agreement of units’ owners
7 of units to which at least a majority of the votes in the association
8 are allocated, unless the declaration specifies a different percentage
9 for all amendments or for specified subjects of amendment. If the
10 declaration requires the approval of another person as a condition of
11 its effectiveness, the amendment is not valid without that approval.
12 2. No action to challenge the validity of an amendment adopted
13 by the association pursuant to this section may be brought more than
14 1 year after the amendment is recorded.
15 3. Every amendment to the declaration must be recorded in
16 every county in which any portion of the common-interest
17 community is located and is effective only upon recordation. An
18 amendment [, except an amendment pursuant to NRS 116.2112,]
19 must be indexed in the grantee’s index in the name of the common-
20 interest community and the association and in the grantor’s index in
21 the name of the parties executing the amendment.
22 4. Except to the extent expressly permitted or required by other
23 provisions of this chapter, no amendment may change the
24 boundaries of any unit or change the allocated interests of a unit in
25 the absence of unanimous consent of only those units’ owners
26 whose units are affected and the consent of a majority of the owners
27 of the remaining units [.] , including a majority of the votes
28 allocated to units not owned by the declarant.
29 5. Amendments to the declaration required by this chapter to
30 be recorded by the association must be prepared, executed, recorded
31 and certified on behalf of the association by any officer of the
32 association designated for that purpose or, in the absence of
33 designation, by the president of the association.
34 6. [An] Except as otherwise provided in subsection 9, an
35 amendment to the declaration which prohibits or materially restricts
36 the permitted uses of a unit or the number or other qualifications of
37 persons who may occupy units may not be enforced against a unit’s
38 owner who was the owner of the unit on the date of the recordation
39 of the amendment as long as the unit’s owner remains the owner of
40 that unit.
41 7. A provision in the declaration creating special declarant’s
42 rights that have not expired may not be amended without the
43 consent of the declarant.
44 8. If any provision of this chapter or of the declaration requires
45 the consent of a holder of a security interest in a unit, or an insurer
-
*AB396_R1*
– 9 –
1 or guarantor of such interest, as a condition to the effectiveness of
2 an amendment to the declaration, that consent is deemed granted if:
3 (a) The holder, insurer or guarantor has not requested, in
4 writing, notice of any proposed amendment; or
5 (b) Notice of any proposed amendment is required or has been
6 requested and a written refusal to consent is not received by the
7 association within 60 days after the association delivers notice of the
8 proposed amendment to the holder, insurer or guarantor, by certified
9 mail, return receipt requested, to the address for notice provided by
10 the holder, insurer or guarantor in a prior written request for notice.
11 9. An association may amend a declaration to restrict the
12 leasing of residential units to the extent that the restriction is
13 reasonably designed to meet underwriting requirements of:
14 (a) Institutional lenders that regularly make loans secured by
15 first mortgages on units in common-interest communities or
16 regularly purchase such mortgages; or
17 (b) Insurance companies that issue insurance policies to
18 associations or units in a common-interest community.
19 Sec. 6. NRS 116.2118 is hereby amended to read as follows:
20 116.2118 1. Except in the case of a taking of all the units by
21 eminent domain, in the case of foreclosure against an entire
22 cooperative of a security interest that has priority over the
23 declaration, or in the circumstances described in NRS 116.2124, a
24 common-interest community may be terminated only by agreement
25 of units’ owners to whom at least 80 percent of the votes in the
26 association are allocated, [or any larger percentage the declaration
27 specifies,] including at least 80 percent of the votes allocated to
28 units that are not owned by the declarant, and with any other
29 approvals required by the declaration. The declaration may require
30 a larger percentage of the total votes in the association for
31 approval, but termination requires approval by at least 80 percent
32 of the votes allocated to units not owned by the declarant. The
33 declaration may specify a smaller percentage only if all of the units
34 are restricted exclusively to nonresidential uses.
35 2. An agreement to terminate must be evidenced by the
36 execution of an agreement to terminate, or ratifications thereof, in
37 the same manner as a deed, by the requisite number of units’
38 owners. The agreement must specify a date after which the
39 agreement will be void unless it is recorded before that date. An
40 agreement to terminate and all ratifications thereof must be recorded
41 in every county in which a portion of the common-interest
42 community is situated and is effective only upon recordation.
43 3. In the case of a condominium or planned community
44 containing only units having horizontal boundaries described in the
45 declaration, an agreement to terminate may provide that all of the
-
*AB396_R1*
– 10 –
1 common elements and units of the common-interest community
2 must be sold following termination. If, pursuant to the agreement,
3 any real estate in the common-interest community is to be sold
4 following termination, the agreement must set forth the minimum
5 terms of the sale.
6 4. In the case of a condominium or planned community
7 containing any units not having horizontal boundaries described in
8 the declaration, an agreement to terminate may provide for sale of
9 the common elements, but it may not require that the units be sold
10 following termination, unless the declaration as originally recorded
11 provided otherwise or all the units’ owners consent to the sale.
12 5. The association, on behalf of the units’ owners, may contract
13 for the sale of real estate in a common-interest community, but the
14 contract is not binding on the units’ owners until approved pursuant
15 to subsections 1 and 2. If any real estate is to be sold following
16 termination, title to that real estate, upon termination, vests in the
17 association as trustee for the holders of all interests in the units.
18 Thereafter, the association has all powers necessary and appropriate
19 to effect the sale. Until the sale has been concluded and the proceeds
20 thereof distributed, the association continues in existence with all
21 powers it had before termination. Proceeds of the sale must be
22 distributed to units’ owners and lienholders as their interests may
23 appear, in accordance with NRS 116.21183 and 116.21185. Unless
24 otherwise specified in the agreement to terminate, as long as the
25 association holds title to the real estate, each unit’s owner and his or
26 her successors in interest have an exclusive right to occupancy of
27 the portion of the real estate that formerly constituted the unit.
28 During the period of that occupancy, each unit’s owner and his or
29 her successors in interest remain liable for all assessments and other
30 obligations imposed on units’ owners by this chapter or the
31 declaration.
32 6. In a condominium or planned community, if the real estate
33 constituting the common-interest community is not to be sold
34 following termination, title to the common elements and, in a
35 common-interest community containing only units having
36 horizontal boundaries described in the declaration, title to all the real
37 estate in the common-interest community, vests in the units’ owners
38 upon termination as tenants in common in proportion to their
39 respective interests as provided in NRS 116.21185, and liens on the
40 units shift accordingly. While the tenancy in common exists, each
41 unit’s owner and his or her successors in interest have an exclusive
42 right to occupancy of the portion of the real estate that formerly
43 constituted the unit.
44 7. Following termination of the common-interest community,
45 the proceeds of a sale of real estate, together with the assets of the
-
*AB396_R1*
– 11 –
1 association, are held by the association as trustee for units’ owners
2 and holders of liens on the units as their interests may appear.
3 Sec. 7. NRS 116.31065 is hereby amended to read as follows:
4 116.31065 The rules adopted by an association:
5 1. Must be reasonably related to the purpose for which they are
6 adopted.
7 2. Must be sufficiently explicit in their prohibition, direction or
8 limitation to inform a person of any action or omission required for
9 compliance.
10 3. Must not be adopted to evade any obligation of the
11 association.
12 4. [Must] Except as otherwise provided in subsection 1 of
13 NRS 116.335, must be consistent with the governing documents of
14 the association and must not arbitrarily restrict conduct or require
15 the construction of any capital improvement by a unit’s owner that
16 is not required by the governing documents of the association.
17 5. Must be uniformly enforced under the same or similar
18 circumstances against all units’ owners. Any rule that is not so
19 uniformly enforced may not be enforced against any unit’s owner.
20 6. May be enforced by the association through the imposition
21 of a fine only if the association complies with the requirements set
22 forth in NRS 116.31031.
23 Sec. 8. NRS 116.335 is hereby amended to read as follows:
24 116.335 1. [Unless, at the time a unit’s owner purchased his
25 or her unit,] If the declaration [prohibited the unit’s owner from
26 renting or leasing his or her unit,] authorizes the association [may
27 not] to prohibit or restrict the unit’s owner from renting or leasing
28 his or her unit [.] , or contains a provision establishing a maximum
29 number or percentage of units in the common-interest community
30 which may be rented or leased, the association may adopt rules
31 and regulations to prohibit or restrict the renting or leasing of
32 residential units to the extent that the restriction is reasonably
33 related to meet underwriting requirements of:
34 (a) Institutional lenders that regularly make loans secured by
35 first mortgages on units in common-interest communities or
36 regularly purchase such mortgages; or
37 (b) Insurance companies that issue insurance policies to
38 associations or units in a common-interest community.
39 2. [Unless, at the time a unit’s owner purchased his or her unit,
40 the declaration required the unit’s owner to secure or obtain any
41 approval from the association in order to rent or lease his or her unit,
42 an association may not require the unit’s owner to secure or obtain
43 any approval from the association in order to rent or lease his or her
44 unit.
-
*AB396_R1*
– 12 –
1 3. If a declaration contains a provision establishing a maximum
2 number or percentage of units in the common-interest community
3 which may be rented or leased, that provision of the declaration may
4 not be amended to decrease that maximum number or percentage of
5 units in the common-interest community which may be rented or
6 leased.
7 4. If the governing documents of an association require a unit’s
8 owner who leases or rents his or her unit, or the tenant of a unit’s
9 owner, to register with the association or its agent or otherwise
10 submit to the association or its agent information concerning the
11 lease or rental agreement or the tenant, the association or its agent:
12 (a) Must conduct such activities in accordance with the
13 governing documents;
14 (b) May not require the unit’s owner or tenant of the unit’s
15 owner to provide information which the association or its agent does
16 not require to be provided to the association or its agent by a unit’s
17 owner who occupies his or her unit, except that the association or its
18 agent may require the unit’s owner to provide a copy of the lease or
19 rental agreement; and
20 (c) May not charge a fee to the unit’s owner for the registration
21 or submission of information.
22 5.] The provisions of this section do not prohibit an association
23 from enforcing any provisions which govern the renting or leasing
24 of units and which are contained in this chapter or in any other
25 applicable federal, state or local laws or regulations [.
26 6.] , including, without limitation, any restriction on the rental
27 of units as transient lodging pursuant to NRS 244.35351 to
28 244.35359, inclusive, or 268.09791 to 268.09799, inclusive.
29 3. Notwithstanding any other provision of law or the
30 declaration to the contrary:
31 (a) If a unit’s owner is prohibited from renting or leasing a unit
32 because the maximum number or percentage of units which may be
33 rented or leased in the common-interest community have already
34 been rented or leased, the unit’s owner may seek a waiver of the
35 prohibition from the executive board based upon a showing of
36 economic hardship, and the executive board may grant such a
37 waiver and approve the renting or leasing of the unit.
38 (b) If the declaration contains a provision establishing a
39 maximum number or percentage of units in the common-interest
40 community which may be rented or leased, in determining the
41 maximum number or percentage of units in the common-interest
42 community which may be rented or leased, the number of units
43 owned by the declarant must not be counted or considered.

1 Sec. 9. NRS 116.4109 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 116.4109 1. Except in the case of a sale in which delivery of
3 a public offering statement is required, or unless exempt under
4 subsection 2 of NRS 116.4101, a unit’s owner or his or her
5 authorized agent shall, at the expense of the unit’s owner, furnish to
6 a purchaser a resale package containing all of the following:

15 unit’s owner.
16 (c) A copy of the current operating budget of the association and
17 current year-to-date financial statement for the association, which
18 must include a summary of the reserves of the association required
19 by NRS 116.31152 and which must include, without limitation, a
20 summary of the information described in paragraphs (a) to (e),
21 inclusive, of subsection 3 of NRS 116.31152.
22 (d) A statement of any unsatisfied judgments or pending legal

25 unit’s owner has actual knowledge.
26 (e) A statement of any transfer fees, transaction fees or any other
27 fees associated with the resale of a unit.
28 (f) In addition to any other document, a statement describing all

31 or penalties, interest rates on delinquent assessments, additional
32 costs for collecting past due fines and charges for opening or closing
33 any file for each unit.
34 (g) Proof of the insurance policies that an association is
35 required to carry pursuant to NRS 116.3113.
36 2. The purchaser may, by written notice, cancel the contract of
37 purchase until midnight of the fifth calendar day following the date
38 of receipt of the resale package described in subsection 1, and the
39 contract for purchase must contain a provision to that effect. If the
40 purchaser elects to cancel a contract pursuant to this subsection,
41 the purchaser must hand deliver the notice of cancellation to the
42 unit’s owner or his or her authorized agent, mail the notice of
43 cancellation by prepaid United States mail to the unit’s owner or his
44 or her authorized agent or deliver the notice of cancellation by
45 electronic transmission to the unit’s owner or his or her authorized
-
*AB396_R1*
– 14 –
1 agent. Cancellation is without penalty, and all payments made by
2 the purchaser before cancellation must be refunded promptly. If the
3 purchaser has accepted a conveyance of the unit, the purchaser is
4 not entitled to:
5 (a) Cancel the contract pursuant to this subsection; or
6 (b) Damages, rescission or other relief based solely on the
7 ground that the unit’s owner or his or her authorized agent failed to
8 furnish the resale package, or any portion thereof, as required by this
9 section.
10 3. Within 10 calendar days after receipt of a written request by
11 a unit’s owner or his or her authorized agent, the association shall
12 furnish all of the following to the unit’s owner or his or her
13 authorized agent for inclusion in the resale package:
14 (a) Copies of the documents required pursuant to paragraphs (a)
15 and (c) of subsection 1; and
16 (b) A certificate containing the information necessary to enable
17 the unit’s owner to comply with paragraphs (b), (d), (e) , [and] (f)
18 and (g) of subsection 1.
19 4. If the association furnishes the documents and certificate
20 pursuant to subsection 3:
21 (a) The unit’s owner or his or her authorized agent shall include
22 the documents and certificate in the resale package provided to the
23 purchaser, and neither the unit’s owner nor his or her authorized
24 agent is liable to the purchaser for any erroneous information
25 provided by the association and included in the documents and
26 certificate.
27 (b) The association may charge the unit’s owner a reasonable
28 fee to cover the cost of preparing the certificate furnished pursuant
29 to subsection 3. Such a fee must be based on the actual cost the
30 association incurs to fulfill the requirements of this section in
31 preparing the certificate and must not exceed $185, except that if a
32 unit’s owner or an authorized agent thereof requests that the
33 certificate be furnished sooner than 3 business days after the date of
34 the request, the association may charge a fee, which must not exceed
35 $100, to expedite the preparation of the certificate. The amount of
36 the fee may increase, on an annual basis, by a percentage equal to
37 the percentage of increase in the Consumer Price Index (All Items)
38 published by the United States Department of Labor for the
39 preceding calendar year, but must not increase by more than 3
40 percent each year.
41 (c) The other documents furnished pursuant to subsection 3
42 must be provided in electronic format to the unit’s owner. If the
43 association is unable to provide such documents in electronic
44 format, the association may charge the unit’s owner a reasonable
-
*AB396_R1*
– 15 –
1 fee, not to exceed 25 cents per page for the first 10 pages, and 10
2 cents per page thereafter, to cover the cost of copying.
3 (d) Except for the fees allowed pursuant to paragraphs (b) and
4 (c), the association may not charge the unit’s owner any other fees
5 for preparing or furnishing the documents and certificate pursuant to
6 subsection 3.
7 5. Neither a purchaser nor the purchaser’s interest in a unit is
8 liable for any unpaid assessment or fee greater than the amount set
9 forth in the documents and certificate prepared by the association. If
10 the association fails to furnish the documents and certificate within
11 the 10 calendar days allowed by this section, the purchaser is not
12 liable for the delinquent assessment. A resale package provided to a
13 unit’s owner or his or her authorized agent pursuant to this section
14 remains effective for 90 calendar days.
15 6. Upon the request of a unit’s owner or his or her authorized
16 agent, or upon the request of a purchaser to whom the unit’s owner
17 has provided a resale package pursuant to this section or his or her
18 authorized agent, the association shall make the entire study of the
19 reserves of the association which is required by NRS 116.31152
20 reasonably available for the unit’s owner, purchaser or authorized
21 agent to inspect, examine, photocopy and audit. The study must be
22 made available at the business office of the association or some
23 other suitable location within the county where the common-interest
24 community is situated or, if it is situated in more than one county,
25 within one of those counties.
26 7. A unit’s owner, the authorized agent of the unit’s owner or
27 the holder of a security interest on the unit may request a statement
28 of demand from the association. Not later than 10 calendar days
29 after receipt of a written request from the unit’s owner, the
30 authorized agent of the unit’s owner or the holder of a security
31 interest on the unit for a statement of demand, the association shall
32 furnish a statement of demand to the person who requested the
33 statement and provide a copy of the statement to any other interested
34 party. The association may charge a fee of not more than $165 to
35 prepare and furnish a statement of demand pursuant to this
36 subsection and an additional fee of not more than $100 to furnish a
37 statement of demand within 3 business days after receipt of a written
38 request for a statement of demand. The amount of the fees for
39 preparing and furnishing a statement of demand and the additional
40 fee for furnishing a statement of demand within 3 business days may
41 increase, on an annual basis, by a percentage equal to the percentage
42 of increase in the Consumer Price Index (All Items) published by
43 the United States Department of Labor for the preceding calendar
44 year, but must not increase by more than 3 percent each year. The
45 statement of demand:
-
*AB396_R1*
– 16 –
1 (a) Must set forth the amount of the monthly assessment for
2 common expenses and any unpaid obligation of any kind, including,
3 without limitation, management fees, transfer fees, fines, penalties,
4 interest, collection costs, foreclosure fees and attorney’s fees
5 currently due from the selling unit’s owner; and
6 (b) Remains effective for the period specified in the statement of
7 demand, which must not be less than 15 business days after the date
8 of delivery by the association to the unit’s owner, the authorized
9 agent of the unit’s owner or the holder of a security interest on the
10 unit, whichever is applicable.
11  As used in this subsection, “interested party” includes the unit’s
12 owner selling the unit and the prospective purchaser of the unit.
13 8. In preparing, copying, furnishing or expediting or otherwise
14 providing any document or other item pursuant to this section, an
15 association, or entity related to or acting on behalf of an association,
16 shall not charge a unit’s owner, the authorized agent of a unit’s
17 owner, a purchaser or, pursuant to subsection 7, the holder of a
18 security interest on a unit, any fee:
19 (a) Not authorized in this section; or
20 (b) In an amount which exceeds any limit set forth in this
21 section.
22 9. If the association becomes aware of an error in a statement
23 of demand furnished pursuant to subsection 7 during the period in
24 which the statement of demand is effective but before the
25 consummation of a resale for which a resale package was furnished
26 pursuant to subsection 1, the association must deliver a replacement
27 statement of demand to the person who requested the statement of
28 demand. Unless the person who requested the statement of demand
29 receives a replacement statement of demand, the person may rely
30 upon the accuracy of the information set forth in the statement of
31 demand provided by the association for the resale. Payment of the
32 amount set forth in the statement of demand constitutes full payment
33 of the amount due from the selling unit’s owner.
34 Sec. 10. NRS 116.785 is hereby amended to read as follows:
35 116.785 1. If the Commission or the hearing panel, after
36 notice and hearing, finds that the respondent has committed a
37 violation, the Commission or the hearing panel may take any or all

2 officer of an association, the Commission or the hearing panel may
3 order the respondent removed from his or her office or position if

5 that:
6 (a) The respondent has knowingly and willfully committed a
7 violation; and
8 (b) The removal is in the best interest of the association.

13 each violation.
14 4. If the Commission or the hearing panel takes any
15 disciplinary action pursuant to this section, the Commission or the
16 hearing panel may order the respondent to pay the costs of the
17 proceedings incurred by the Division, including, without limitation,
18 the cost of the investigation and reasonable attorney’s fees.
19 5. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, unless

22 association:
23 (a) The association is liable for all fines and costs imposed
24 against the respondent pursuant to this section; and
25 (b) The respondent may not be held personally liable for those

35 is 60,000 or more does not adopt an ordinance that is consistent with
36 the provisions of section 1 of this act before January 1, 2026,

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Section 1 of this bill requires each governing body of a county whose
2 population is 100,000 or more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties) and each
3 governing body of a city whose population is 60,000 or more (currently the Cities
4 of Las Vegas, Henderson, North Las Vegas, Reno and Sparks) to adopt an
-
*AB396_R1*

– 2 –
5 ordinance that authorizes the owner of a residential property to apply to add an
6 accessory dwelling unit to the residential property. Section 1 provides that any such
7 ordinance does not apply in a region in a county or city for which there has been
8 created by interstate compact a regional planning agency and the regional plan
9 adopted by the regional planning agency calls for the regulation of housing. Section
10 1 further requires the ordinance to authorize, under certain circumstances, an
11 additional accessory dwelling unit to the residential property. Section 1 also sets
12 forth various requirements for the ordinance, including that the ordinance set forth
13 an expedited process for the approval of the application and any appeal of the
14 denial of such an application. Section 1 further limits provisions of the ordinance,
15 including by prohibiting the ordinance from placing certain conditions on the
16 approval of the accessory dwelling unit.
17 Section 11 of this bill provides that: (1) if, before January 1, 2026, the
18 governing body of a county whose population is 100,000 or more or the governing
19 body of a city whose population is 60,000 or more has adopted an ordinance that is
20 consistent with section 1, the governing body is not required to adopt another
21 ordinance relating to accessory dwelling units pursuant to section 1; and (2) if the
22 governing body of a county whose population is 100,000 or more or the governing
23 body of a city whose population is 60,000 or more does not adopt an ordinance that
24 is consistent with section 1 before January 1, 2026, accessory dwelling units are
25 authorized on any parcel zoned for residential use without restriction.
26 Existing law authorizes the governing body of a county or city to divide the
27 county, city or region into zoning districts of such number, shape and area as are
28 best suited to carry out certain purposes. Within a zoning district, the governing
29 body is authorized to regulate and restrict the erection, reconstruction, alteration,
30 repair or use of buildings, structures or land. (NRS 278.250) Section 4 of this bill
31 creates an exception to account for the requirement that the governing body of
32 certain counties and cities adopt an ordinance to allow the addition of an accessory
33 dwelling unit pursuant to section 1.
34 Existing law requires that an action or proceeding seeking judicial relief or
35 review from or with respect to any final action, decision or order of any governing
36 body of a county or city be commenced within 25 days after the date of filing of
37 notice of the final action, decision or order with the clerk or secretary of the
38 governing body. (NRS 278.0235) Section 3 of this bill applies these provisions to
39 section 1.
40 Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to apply the definitions of
41 certain terms relating to planning and zoning to section 1.
42 Existing law sets forth certain requirements for the amendment of a declaration
43 of a common-interest community, including that every amendment to the
44 declaration must, with certain exceptions, be indexed in the grantee’s index in the
45 name of the common-interest community and the association and in the grantor’s
46 index in the name of the parties executing the amendment. (NRS 116.2117) Section
47 5 of this bill eliminates the exception for an amendment for the relocation of
48 boundaries between adjoining units. (NRS 116.2112)
49 Section 5 also authorizes an association to amend a declaration to restrict the
50 leasing of residential units to the extent that the restriction is reasonably designed to
51 meet certain underwriting requirements.
52 Existing law sets forth the requirements for terminating a common-interest
53 community. (NRS 116.2118) Section 6 of this bill amends the voting requirements
54 for terminating a common-interest community.
55 Sections 7 and 8 of this bill revise provisions relating to prohibiting or
56 restricting a unit owner from renting or leasing his or her unit.
57 Existing law requires a unit’s owner or his or her authorized agent, at the
58 expense of the unit’s owner, to furnish to a purchaser a resale package containing
59 certain information. (NRS 116.4109) Section 9 of this bill requires that a resale
-
*AB396_R1*

– 3 –
60 package also contain proof of the insurance policies that an association is required
61 to carry.
62 Existing law authorizes, under certain circumstances, the Commission for
63 Common-Interest Communities and Condominium Hotels to impose an
64 administrative fine of not more than $1,000 for certain violations. (NRS 116.785)
65 Section 10 of this bill increases the administrative fine to not more than $5,000.

45 NRS 116.211, or by the association under NRS 116.1107, 116.2106,
-
*AB396_R1*

– 8 –
1 subsection 3 of NRS 116.2108, subsection 1 of NRS 116.2112 or
2 NRS 116.2113, or by certain units’ owners under subsection 2 of
3 NRS 116.2108, subsection 1 of NRS 116.2112, subsection 2 of NRS
4 116.2113 or subsection 2 of NRS 116.2118, and except as otherwise
5 limited by subsections 4, 6, 7 and 8, the declaration, including any
6 plats, may be amended only by vote or agreement of units’ owners
7 of units to which at least a majority of the votes in the association
8 are allocated, unless the declaration specifies a different percentage
9 for all amendments or for specified subjects of amendment. If the
10 declaration requires the approval of another person as a condition of
11 its effectiveness, the amendment is not valid without that approval.
12 2. No action to challenge the validity of an amendment adopted
13 by the association pursuant to this section may be brought more than
14 1 year after the amendment is recorded.
15 3. Every amendment to the declaration must be recorded in
16 every county in which any portion of the common-interest
17 community is located and is effective only upon recordation. An
18 amendment [, except an amendment pursuant to NRS 116.2112,]
19 must be indexed in the grantee’s index in the name of the common-
20 interest community and the association and in the grantor’s index in
21 the name of the parties executing the amendment.
22 4. Except to the extent expressly permitted or required by other
23 provisions of this chapter, no amendment may change the
24 boundaries of any unit or change the allocated interests of a unit in
25 the absence of unanimous consent of only those units’ owners
26 whose units are affected and the consent of a majority of the owners
27 of the remaining units [.] , including a majority of the votes
28 allocated to units not owned by the declarant.
29 5. Amendments to the declaration required by this chapter to
30 be recorded by the association must be prepared, executed, recorded
31 and certified on behalf of the association by any officer of the
32 association designated for that purpose or, in the absence of
33 designation, by the president of the association.
34 6. [An] Except as otherwise provided in subsection 9, an
35 amendment to the declaration which prohibits or materially restricts
36 the permitted uses of a unit or the number or other qualifications of
37 persons who may occupy units may not be enforced against a unit’s
38 owner who was the owner of the unit on the date of the recordation
39 of the amendment as long as the unit’s owner remains the owner of
40 that unit.
41 7. A provision in the declaration creating special declarant’s
42 rights that have not expired may not be amended without the
43 consent of the declarant.
44 8. If any provision of this chapter or of the declaration requires
45 the consent of a holder of a security interest in a unit, or an insurer
-
*AB396_R1*

– 9 –
1 or guarantor of such interest, as a condition to the effectiveness of
2 an amendment to the declaration, that consent is deemed granted if:
3 (a) The holder, insurer or guarantor has not requested, in
4 writing, notice of any proposed amendment; or
5 (b) Notice of any proposed amendment is required or has been
6 requested and a written refusal to consent is not received by the
7 association within 60 days after the association delivers notice of the
8 proposed amendment to the holder, insurer or guarantor, by certified
9 mail, return receipt requested, to the address for notice provided by
10 the holder, insurer or guarantor in a prior written request for notice.
11 9. An association may amend a declaration to restrict the
12 leasing of residential units to the extent that the restriction is
13 reasonably designed to meet underwriting requirements of:
14 (a) Institutional lenders that regularly make loans secured by
15 first mortgages on units in common-interest communities or
16 regularly purchase such mortgages; or
17 (b) Insurance companies that issue insurance policies to
18 associations or units in a common-interest community.
19 Sec. 6. NRS 116.2118 is hereby amended to read as follows:
20 116.2118 1. Except in the case of a taking of all the units by
21 eminent domain, in the case of foreclosure against an entire
22 cooperative of a security interest that has priority over the
23 declaration, or in the circumstances described in NRS 116.2124, a
24 common-interest community may be terminated only by agreement
25 of units’ owners to whom at least 80 percent of the votes in the
26 association are allocated, [or any larger percentage the declaration
27 specifies,] including at least 80 percent of the votes allocated to
28 units that are not owned by the declarant, and with any other
29 approvals required by the declaration. The declaration may require
30 a larger percentage of the total votes in the association for
31 approval, but termination requires approval by at least 80 percent
32 of the votes allocated to units not owned by the declarant. The
33 declaration may specify a smaller percentage only if all of the units
34 are restricted exclusively to nonresidential uses.
35 2. An agreement to terminate must be evidenced by the
36 execution of an agreement to terminate, or ratifications thereof, in
37 the same manner as a deed, by the requisite number of units’
38 owners. The agreement must specify a date after which the
39 agreement will be void unless it is recorded before that date. An
40 agreement to terminate and all ratifications thereof must be recorded
41 in every county in which a portion of the common-interest
42 community is situated and is effective only upon recordation.
43 3. In the case of a condominium or planned community
44 containing only units having horizontal boundaries described in the
45 declaration, an agreement to terminate may provide that all of the
-
*AB396_R1*

– 10 –
1 common elements and units of the common-interest community
2 must be sold following termination. If, pursuant to the agreement,
3 any real estate in the common-interest community is to be sold
4 following termination, the agreement must set forth the minimum
5 terms of the sale.
6 4. In the case of a condominium or planned community
7 containing any units not having horizontal boundaries described in
8 the declaration, an agreement to terminate may provide for sale of
9 the common elements, but it may not require that the units be sold
10 following termination, unless the declaration as originally recorded
11 provided otherwise or all the units’ owners consent to the sale.
12 5. The association, on behalf of the units’ owners, may contract
13 for the sale of real estate in a common-interest community, but the
14 contract is not binding on the units’ owners until approved pursuant
15 to subsections 1 and 2. If any real estate is to be sold following
16 termination, title to that real estate, upon termination, vests in the
17 association as trustee for the holders of all interests in the units.
18 Thereafter, the association has all powers necessary and appropriate
19 to effect the sale. Until the sale has been concluded and the proceeds
20 thereof distributed, the association continues in existence with all
21 powers it had before termination. Proceeds of the sale must be
22 distributed to units’ owners and lienholders as their interests may
23 appear, in accordance with NRS 116.21183 and 116.21185. Unless
24 otherwise specified in the agreement to terminate, as long as the
25 association holds title to the real estate, each unit’s owner and his or
26 her successors in interest have an exclusive right to occupancy of
27 the portion of the real estate that formerly constituted the unit.
28 During the period of that occupancy, each unit’s owner and his or
29 her successors in interest remain liable for all assessments and other
30 obligations imposed on units’ owners by this chapter or the
31 declaration.
32 6. In a condominium or planned community, if the real estate
33 constituting the common-interest community is not to be sold
34 following termination, title to the common elements and, in a
35 common-interest community containing only units having
36 horizontal boundaries described in the declaration, title to all the real
37 estate in the common-interest community, vests in the units’ owners
38 upon termination as tenants in common in proportion to their
39 respective interests as provided in NRS 116.21185, and liens on the
40 units shift accordingly. While the tenancy in common exists, each
41 unit’s owner and his or her successors in interest have an exclusive
42 right to occupancy of the portion of the real estate that formerly
43 constituted the unit.
44 7. Following termination of the common-interest community,
45 the proceeds of a sale of real estate, together with the assets of the
-
*AB396_R1*

– 11 –
1 association, are held by the association as trustee for units’ owners
2 and holders of liens on the units as their interests may appear.
3 Sec. 7. NRS 116.31065 is hereby amended to read as follows:
4 116.31065 The rules adopted by an association:
5 1. Must be reasonably related to the purpose for which they are
6 adopted.
7 2. Must be sufficiently explicit in their prohibition, direction or
8 limitation to inform a person of any action or omission required for
9 compliance.
10 3. Must not be adopted to evade any obligation of the
11 association.
12 4. [Must] Except as otherwise provided in subsection 1 of
13 NRS 116.335, must be consistent with the governing documents of
14 the association and must not arbitrarily restrict conduct or require
15 the construction of any capital improvement by a unit’s owner that
16 is not required by the governing documents of the association.
17 5. Must be uniformly enforced under the same or similar
18 circumstances against all units’ owners. Any rule that is not so
19 uniformly enforced may not be enforced against any unit’s owner.
20 6. May be enforced by the association through the imposition
21 of a fine only if the association complies with the requirements set
22 forth in NRS 116.31031.
23 Sec. 8. NRS 116.335 is hereby amended to read as follows:
24 116.335 1. [Unless, at the time a unit’s owner purchased his
25 or her unit,] If the declaration [prohibited the unit’s owner from
26 renting or leasing his or her unit,] authorizes the association [may
27 not] to prohibit or restrict the unit’s owner from renting or leasing
28 his or her unit [.] , or contains a provision establishing a maximum
29 number or percentage of units in the common-interest community
30 which may be rented or leased, the association may adopt rules
31 and regulations to prohibit or restrict the renting or leasing of
32 residential units to the extent that the restriction is reasonably
33 related to meet underwriting requirements of:
34 (a) Institutional lenders that regularly make loans secured by
35 first mortgages on units in common-interest communities or
36 regularly purchase such mortgages; or
37 (b) Insurance companies that issue insurance policies to
38 associations or units in a common-interest community.
39 2. [Unless, at the time a unit’s owner purchased his or her unit,
40 the declaration required the unit’s owner to secure or obtain any
41 approval from the association in order to rent or lease his or her unit,
42 an association may not require the unit’s owner to secure or obtain
43 any approval from the association in order to rent or lease his or her
44 unit.

*AB396_R1*

– 12 –
1 3. If a declaration contains a provision establishing a maximum
2 number or percentage of units in the common-interest community
3 which may be rented or leased, that provision of the declaration may
4 not be amended to decrease that maximum number or percentage of
5 units in the common-interest community which may be rented or
6 leased.
7 4. If the governing documents of an association require a unit’s
8 owner who leases or rents his or her unit, or the tenant of a unit’s
9 owner, to register with the association or its agent or otherwise
10 submit to the association or its agent information concerning the
11 lease or rental agreement or the tenant, the association or its agent:
12 (a) Must conduct such activities in accordance with the
13 governing documents;
14 (b) May not require the unit’s owner or tenant of the unit’s
15 owner to provide information which the association or its agent does
16 not require to be provided to the association or its agent by a unit’s
17 owner who occupies his or her unit, except that the association or its
18 agent may require the unit’s owner to provide a copy of the lease or
19 rental agreement; and
20 (c) May not charge a fee to the unit’s owner for the registration
21 or submission of information.
22 5.] The provisions of this section do not prohibit an association
23 from enforcing any provisions which govern the renting or leasing
24 of units and which are contained in this chapter or in any other
25 applicable federal, state or local laws or regulations [.
26 6.] , including, without limitation, any restriction on the rental
27 of units as transient lodging pursuant to NRS 244.35351 to
28 244.35359, inclusive, or 268.09791 to 268.09799, inclusive.
29 3. Notwithstanding any other provision of law or the
30 declaration to the contrary:
31 (a) If a unit’s owner is prohibited from renting or leasing a unit
32 because the maximum number or percentage of units which may be
33 rented or leased in the common-interest community have already
34 been rented or leased, the unit’s owner may seek a waiver of the
35 prohibition from the executive board based upon a showing of
36 economic hardship, and the executive board may grant such a
37 waiver and approve the renting or leasing of the unit.
38 (b) If the declaration contains a provision establishing a
39 maximum number or percentage of units in the common-interest
40 community which may be rented or leased, in determining the
41 maximum number or percentage of units in the common-interest
42 community which may be rented or leased, the number of units
43 owned by the declarant must not be counted or considered.

1 Sec. 9. NRS 116.4109 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 116.4109 1. Except in the case of a sale in which delivery of
3 a public offering statement is required, or unless exempt under
4 subsection 2 of NRS 116.4101, a unit’s owner or his or her
5 authorized agent shall, at the expense of the unit’s owner, furnish to
6 a purchaser a resale package containing all of the following:
7 (a) A copy of the declaration, other than any plats, the bylaws,

13 fees, transfer fees, fines, penalties, interest, collection costs,
14 foreclosure fees and attorney’s fees currently due from the selling
15 unit’s owner.
16 (c) A copy of the current operating budget of the association and
17 current year-to-date financial statement for the association, which
18 must include a summary of the reserves of the association required
19 by NRS 116.31152 and which must include, without limitation, a
20 summary of the information described in paragraphs (a) to (e),
21 inclusive, of subsection 3 of NRS 116.31152.
22 (d) A statement of any unsatisfied judgments or pending legal
23 actions against the association and the status of any pending legal
24 actions relating to the common-interest community of which the
25 unit’s owner has actual knowledge.
26 (e) A statement of any transfer fees, transaction fees or any other
27 fees associated with the resale of a unit.
28 (f) In addition to any other document, a statement describing all
29 current and expected fees or charges for each unit, including,
30 without limitation, association fees, fines, assessments, late charges
31 or penalties, interest rates on delinquent assessments, additional
32 costs for collecting past due fines and charges for opening or closing
33 any file for each unit.
34 (g) Proof of the insurance policies that an association is
35 required to carry pursuant to NRS 116.3113.
36 2. The purchaser may, by written notice, cancel the contract of
37 purchase until midnight of the fifth calendar day following the date
38 of receipt of the resale package described in subsection 1, and the
39 contract for purchase must contain a provision to that effect. If the
40 purchaser elects to cancel a contract pursuant to this subsection,
41 the purchaser must hand deliver the notice of cancellation to the
42 unit’s owner or his or her authorized agent, mail the notice of
43 cancellation by prepaid United States mail to the unit’s owner or his
44 or her authorized agent or deliver the notice of cancellation by
45 electronic transmission to the unit’s owner or his or her authorized
-
*AB396_R1*

– 14 –
1 agent. Cancellation is without penalty, and all payments made by
2 the purchaser before cancellation must be refunded promptly. If the
3 purchaser has accepted a conveyance of the unit, the purchaser is
4 not entitled to:
5 (a) Cancel the contract pursuant to this subsection; or
6 (b) Damages, rescission or other relief based solely on the
7 ground that the unit’s owner or his or her authorized agent failed to
8 furnish the resale package, or any portion thereof, as required by this
9 section.
10 3. Within 10 calendar days after receipt of a written request by
11 a unit’s owner or his or her authorized agent, the association shall
12 furnish all of the following to the unit’s owner or his or her
13 authorized agent for inclusion in the resale package:
14 (a) Copies of the documents required pursuant to paragraphs (a)
15 and (c) of subsection 1; and
16 (b) A certificate containing the information necessary to enable
17 the unit’s owner to comply with paragraphs (b), (d), (e) , [and] (f)
18 and (g) of subsection 1.
19 4. If the association furnishes the documents and certificate
20 pursuant to subsection 3:
21 (a) The unit’s owner or his or her authorized agent shall include
22 the documents and certificate in the resale package provided to the
23 purchaser, and neither the unit’s owner nor his or her authorized
24 agent is liable to the purchaser for any erroneous information
25 provided by the association and included in the documents and
26 certificate.
27 (b) The association may charge the unit’s owner a reasonable
28 fee to cover the cost of preparing the certificate furnished pursuant
29 to subsection 3. Such a fee must be based on the actual cost the
30 association incurs to fulfill the requirements of this section in
31 preparing the certificate and must not exceed $185, except that if a
32 unit’s owner or an authorized agent thereof requests that the
33 certificate be furnished sooner than 3 business days after the date of
34 the request, the association may charge a fee, which must not exceed
35 $100, to expedite the preparation of the certificate. The amount of
36 the fee may increase, on an annual basis, by a percentage equal to
37 the percentage of increase in the Consumer Price Index (All Items)
38 published by the United States Department of Labor for the
39 preceding calendar year, but must not increase by more than 3
40 percent each year.
41 (c) The other documents furnished pursuant to subsection 3
42 must be provided in electronic format to the unit’s owner. If the
43 association is unable to provide such documents in electronic
44 format, the association may charge the unit’s owner a reasonable
-
*AB396_R1*

– 15 –
1 fee, not to exceed 25 cents per page for the first 10 pages, and 10
2 cents per page thereafter, to cover the cost of copying.
3 (d) Except for the fees allowed pursuant to paragraphs (b) and
4 (c), the association may not charge the unit’s owner any other fees
5 for preparing or furnishing the documents and certificate pursuant to
6 subsection 3.
7 5. Neither a purchaser nor the purchaser’s interest in a unit is
8 liable for any unpaid assessment or fee greater than the amount set
9 forth in the documents and certificate prepared by the association. If
10 the association fails to furnish the documents and certificate within
11 the 10 calendar days allowed by this section, the purchaser is not
12 liable for the delinquent assessment. A resale package provided to a
13 unit’s owner or his or her authorized agent pursuant to this section
14 remains effective for 90 calendar days.
15 6. Upon the request of a unit’s owner or his or her authorized
16 agent, or upon the request of a purchaser to whom the unit’s owner
17 has provided a resale package pursuant to this section or his or her
18 authorized agent, the association shall make the entire study of the
19 reserves of the association which is required by NRS 116.31152
20 reasonably available for the unit’s owner, purchaser or authorized
21 agent to inspect, examine, photocopy and audit. The study must be
22 made available at the business office of the association or some
23 other suitable location within the county where the common-interest
24 community is situated or, if it is situated in more than one county,
25 within one of those counties.
26 7. A unit’s owner, the authorized agent of the unit’s owner or
27 the holder of a security interest on the unit may request a statement
28 of demand from the association. Not later than 10 calendar days
29 after receipt of a written request from the unit’s owner, the
30 authorized agent of the unit’s owner or the holder of a security
31 interest on the unit for a statement of demand, the association shall
32 furnish a statement of demand to the person who requested the
33 statement and provide a copy of the statement to any other interested
34 party. The association may charge a fee of not more than $165 to
35 prepare and furnish a statement of demand pursuant to this
36 subsection and an additional fee of not more than $100 to furnish a
37 statement of demand within 3 business days after receipt of a written
38 request for a statement of demand. The amount of the fees for
39 preparing and furnishing a statement of demand and the additional
40 fee for furnishing a statement of demand within 3 business days may
41 increase, on an annual basis, by a percentage equal to the percentage
42 of increase in the Consumer Price Index (All Items) published by
43 the United States Department of Labor for the preceding calendar
44 year, but must not increase by more than 3 percent each year. The
45 statement of demand:
-
*AB396_R1*

– 16 –
1 (a) Must set forth the amount of the monthly assessment for
2 common expenses and any unpaid obligation of any kind, including,
3 without limitation, management fees, transfer fees, fines, penalties,
4 interest, collection costs, foreclosure fees and attorney’s fees
5 currently due from the selling unit’s owner; and
6 (b) Remains effective for the period specified in the statement of
7 demand, which must not be less than 15 business days after the date
8 of delivery by the association to the unit’s owner, the authorized
9 agent of the unit’s owner or the holder of a security interest on the
10 unit, whichever is applicable.
11  As used in this subsection, “interested party” includes the unit’s
12 owner selling the unit and the prospective purchaser of the unit.
13 8. In preparing, copying, furnishing or expediting or otherwise
14 providing any document or other item pursuant to this section, an
15 association, or entity related to or acting on behalf of an association,
16 shall not charge a unit’s owner, the authorized agent of a unit’s
17 owner, a purchaser or, pursuant to subsection 7, the holder of a
18 security interest on a unit, any fee:
19 (a) Not authorized in this section; or
20 (b) In an amount which exceeds any limit set forth in this
21 section.
22 9. If the association becomes aware of an error in a statement
23 of demand furnished pursuant to subsection 7 during the period in
24 which the statement of demand is effective but before the
25 consummation of a resale for which a resale package was furnished
26 pursuant to subsection 1, the association must deliver a replacement
27 statement of demand to the person who requested the statement of
28 demand. Unless the person who requested the statement of demand
29 receives a replacement statement of demand, the person may rely
30 upon the accuracy of the information set forth in the statement of
31 demand provided by the association for the resale. Payment of the
32 amount set forth in the statement of demand constitutes full payment
33 of the amount due from the selling unit’s owner.
34 Sec. 10. NRS 116.785 is hereby amended to read as follows:
35 116.785 1. If the Commission or the hearing panel, after
36 notice and hearing, finds that the respondent has committed a
37 violation, the Commission or the hearing panel may take any or all
38 of the following actions:
39 (a) Issue an order directing the respondent to cease and desist
40 from continuing to engage in the unlawful conduct that resulted in

1 2. If the respondent is a member of an executive board or an
2 officer of an association, the Commission or the hearing panel may
3 order the respondent removed from his or her office or position if
4 the Commission or the hearing panel, after notice and hearing, finds
5 that:
6 (a) The respondent has knowingly and willfully committed a
7 violation; and
8 (b) The removal is in the best interest of the association.
9 3. If the respondent violates any order issued by the
10 Commission or the hearing panel pursuant to this section, the
11 Commission or the hearing panel, after notice and hearing, may
12 impose an administrative fine of not more than [$1,000] $5,000 for
13 each violation.
14 4. If the Commission or the hearing panel takes any
15 disciplinary action pursuant to this section, the Commission or the
16 hearing panel may order the respondent to pay the costs of the
17 proceedings incurred by the Division, including, without limitation,
18 the cost of the investigation and reasonable attorney’s fees.
19 5. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, unless
20 the respondent has knowingly and willfully committed a violation, if

22 association:
23 (a) The association is liable for all fines and costs imposed
24 against the respondent pursuant to this section; and
25 (b) The respondent may not be held personally liable for those
26 fines and costs.
27 Sec. 11. 1. If, before January 1, 2026, the governing body of

29 body of a city whose population is 60,000 or more has adopted an
30 ordinance that is consistent with the provisions of section 1 of this
31 act, the governing body is not required to adopt another ordinance
32 relating to accessory dwelling units pursuant to section 1 of this act.
33 2. If the governing body of a county whose population is
34 100,000 or more or the governing body of a city whose population
35 is 60,000 or more does not adopt an ordinance that is consistent with
36 the provisions of section 1 of this act before January 1, 2026,
37 accessory dwelling units are authorized on any parcel zoned for
