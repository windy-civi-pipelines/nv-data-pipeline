AN ACT relating to education; requiring the Department of Education to adopt a
model policy concerning [the notification of a parent or legal guardian
of a pupil who has exhibited signs and behaviors consistent with
substance use; requiring] screening for the behavioral, social and
emotional well-being of pupils; authorizing public and private
schools to [comply with that] adopt the policy; [requiring certain staff
members of a school to file a report of child abuse or neglect under
certain circumstances; requiring the Department to obtain certain data
and that certain documents be provided to the Legislature upon
request;] and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires: (1) each school district to adopt a plan to ensure that public schools
2 are safe and free of controlled substances; and (2) each school district, university school for
3 profoundly gifted pupils and charter school to prescribe rules of behavior required of and
4 prohibited for pupils. (NRS 388A.495, 388C.150, 392.463)
5 Section 2 of this bill requires the Department of Education , in collaboration with
6 experts in education and child mental and behavioral health, to [adopt an evidence-based]
7 develop, implement and disseminate a model policy concerning [the notification of the
8 parent or legal guardian of a pupil who has exhibited signs and behaviors that are consistent
9 with substance use.] screening for the behavioral, social and emotional well-being of
10 pupils. Section 2 requires the policy to be based on a progressive system of support and
11 include: (1) [the completion of a screening questionnaire concerning the mental health and
12 substance use of the pupil;] processes for implementing the policy; (2) [holding at least one
13 meeting to discuss the observed signs and behaviors; and] a variety of tools for identifying
14 behavioral, social and emotional risk factors for mental and behavioral health or
15 substance use issues; (3) [filing certain reports with the school concerning the questionnaire
16 and the meetings.] resources for training the staff of schools; and (4) guidelines for
17 monitoring and evaluating the use and effectiveness of the policy. Sections 2 and 6 of this

Senate Amendment No. 421 to Senate Bill No. 254 Page 4
18 bill [require public and] authorize the board of trustees of a school district, the governing
19 body of a charter school or university school for profoundly gifted pupils or a private
20 [schools] school to [comply with] adopt the policy . [and destroy certain reports concerning
21 signs and behaviors consistent with substance use by a pupil after the occurrence of certain
22 events that eliminate the need to maintain the reports.
23 Existing law requires an employee of or volunteer for a public or private school who, in
24 that capacity, knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a child has been subjected to
25 abuse or neglect to report such abuse or neglect to the agency which provides child welfare
26 services in the county in which the school is located and a law enforcement agency. (NRS
27 392.303) Sections 2 and 6 require a staff member who witnesses signs and behaviors
28 consistent with substance use and participates in a meeting concerning those signs and
29 behaviors, or an administrator who participates in such a meeting, to file a report of child
30 abuse if the staff member or administrator determines that the parent or guardian of the pupil
31 is providing the substance to the pupil.
32 Sections 3 and 7 of this bill require: (1) the Department to obtain data from schools on the
33 implementation and effectiveness of the policy adopted pursuant to section 2 and provide such
34 data to the Legislature upon request; and (2) a school to provide redacted copies of any reports
35 in the possession of the school pursuant to section 2 or 6, as applicable, to the Legislature
36 upon request. Section 4 of this bill makes a conforming change to indicate the proper
37 placement of sections 2 and 3 in the Nevada Revised Statutes. Sections 2, 3, 7 and 8 of this
38 bill provide for the confidentiality of questionnaires completed by pupils, reports concerning
39 signs and behaviors consistent with substance use and the personally identifiable information
40 of pupils and staff. Section 9 of this bill requires the Department, on or before July 1, 2026, to
41 adopt the policy required by section 2 and submit that policy to the Director of the Legislative
42 Counsel Bureau for transmittal to the Legislature and Joint Interim Standing Committee on
43 Education.]

44 Statutes of Nevada 2011 and section 2 of chapter 391, Statutes of Nevada 2013 and
45 unless otherwise declared by law to be confidential, all public books and public
46 records of a governmental entity must be open at all times during office hours to
47 inspection by any person, and may be fully copied or an abstract or memorandum
48 may be prepared from those public books and public records. Any such copies,

Senate Amendment No. 421 to Senate Bill No. 254 Page 9
1 diminish or affect in any other manner the rights of a person in any written book or
2 record which is copyrighted pursuant to federal law.
3 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record which is
4 copyrighted solely because it is copyrighted.
5 3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a public book or
6 record shall not deny a request made pursuant to subsection 1 to inspect or copy or
7 receive a copy of a public book or record on the basis that the requested public
8 book or record contains information that is confidential if the governmental entity
9 can redact, delete, conceal or separate, including, without limitation, electronically,
10 the confidential information from the information included in the public book or
11 record that is not otherwise confidential.
12 4. If requested, a governmental entity shall provide a copy of a public record
13 in an electronic format by means of an electronic medium. Nothing in this
14 subsection requires a governmental entity to provide a copy of a public record in an
15 electronic format or by means of an electronic medium if:
16 (a) The public record:
17 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
18 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
19 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by means of an
20 electronic medium would:
21 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
22 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential and that
23 cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from information that is not
24 otherwise confidential.
25 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who has legal
26 custody or control of a public record:
27 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the medium that
28 is requested because the officer, employee or agent has already prepared or would
29 prefer to provide the copy in a different medium.
30 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon request, prepare
31 the copy of the public record and shall not require the person who has requested the
32 copy to prepare the copy himself or herself.] (Deleted by amendment.)
