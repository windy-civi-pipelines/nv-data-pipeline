AN ACT relating to education; requiring the Department of
Education to adopt a policy concerning the notification of
a parent or legal guardian of a pupil who has exhibited

policy; requiring certain staff members of a school to file
a report of child abuse or neglect under certain
circumstances; requiring the Department to obtain certain
data and that certain documents be provided to the
Legislature upon request; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires: (1) each school district to adopt a plan to ensure that
2 public schools are safe and free of controlled substances; and (2) each school
3 district, university school for profoundly gifted pupils and charter school to
4 prescribe rules of behavior required of and prohibited for pupils. (NRS 388A.495,
5 388C.150, 392.463)
6 Section 2 of this bill requires the Department of Education to adopt an
7 evidence-based policy concerning the notification of the parent or legal guardian of
8 a pupil who has exhibited signs and behaviors that are consistent with substance
9 use. Section 2 requires the policy to include: (1) the completion of a screening
10 questionnaire concerning the mental health and substance use of the pupil; (2)
11 holding at least one meeting to discuss the observed signs and behaviors; and (3)

– 2 –
12 filing certain reports with the school concerning the questionnaire and the meetings.
13 Sections 2 and 6 of this bill require public and private schools to comply with the
14 policy and destroy certain reports concerning signs and behaviors consistent with
15 substance use by a pupil after the occurrence of certain events that eliminate the
16 need to maintain the reports.
17 Existing law requires an employee of or volunteer for a public or private school
18 who, in that capacity, knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a child has
19 been subjected to abuse or neglect to report such abuse or neglect to the agency
20 which provides child welfare services in the county in which the school is located
21 and a law enforcement agency. (NRS 392.303) Sections 2 and 6 require a staff
22 member who witnesses signs and behaviors consistent with substance use and
23 participates in a meeting concerning those signs and behaviors, or an administrator
24 who participates in such a meeting, to file a report of child abuse if the staff
25 member or administrator determines that the parent or guardian of the pupil is
26 providing the substance to the pupil.
27 Sections 3 and 7 of this bill require: (1) the Department to obtain data from
28 schools on the implementation and effectiveness of the policy adopted pursuant to
29 section 2 and provide such data to the Legislature upon request; and (2) a school
30 to provide redacted copies of any reports in the possession of the school pursuant to
31 section 2 or 6, as applicable, to the Legislature upon request. Section 4 of this bill
32 makes a conforming change to indicate the proper placement of sections 2 and 3 in
33 the Nevada Revised Statutes. Sections 2, 3, 7 and 8 of this bill provide for the
34 confidentiality of questionnaires completed by pupils, reports concerning signs and
35 behaviors consistent with substance use and the personally identifiable information
36 of pupils and staff. Section 9 of this bill requires the Department, on or before
37 July 1, 2026, to adopt the policy required by section 2 and submit that policy to the
38 Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau for transmittal to the Legislature and
39 Joint Interim Standing Committee on Education.

39 and that cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from
40 information that is not otherwise confidential.
41 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who
