~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; repealing certain provisions relating
to the requirement that a consultant selected by the State
Board of Education review school districts based upon
certain financial management principles; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires, with certain exceptions and to the extent that money is
2 made available by the Legislature, that each school district undergo a review based on
3 certain financial management principles every 6 years. (NRS 387.607, 387.613,
4 387.622) Existing law sets forth procedures for the selection: (1) by the Legislature,
5 of the school districts to be reviewed in each even-numbered year; and (2) by the
6 State Board of Education, of an independent consultant to perform the review.
7 Existing law requires the State Board to monitor the performance of the consultant
8 with the assistance of an oversight committee. (NRS 387.613, 387.618) Existing law
9 further prescribes certain financial management procedures and certain areas of
10 review and the duties of a consultant. (NRS 387.622, 387.626) Upon completion of
11 the review, existing law requires: (1) the consultant to submit a final report of the
12 review to the board of trustees of the school district, the State Board, the Legislative
13 Auditor and the Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau for transmission to the
14 Legislature; and (2) the board of trustees of a school district to hold a public meeting
15 concerning the final report and vote on whether to adopt the plan for corrective action
16 if such a plan is recommended by the consultant. (NRS 387.631, 387.636) If the plan
17 for corrective action is adopted, the board of trustees is required to prepare a written
18 progress report and a final written report that indicate certain information relating to
19 the implementation of the plan. (NRS 387.639)
20 Section 2 of this bill eliminates the requirement for the performance of these
21 reviews and certain provisions related to these reviews. Section 1 of this bill makes a
22 conforming change to eliminate certain references to repealed sections that make
23 certain reports confidential.
