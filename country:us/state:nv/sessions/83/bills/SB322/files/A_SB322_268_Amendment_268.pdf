Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 The Nevada Constitution requires the Legislature to provide for: (1) the establishment of
2 a State University controlled by a Board of Regents, whose duties are to be prescribed by law;
3 and (2) the election of the members of the Board of Regents of Nevada. (Nev. Const. Art. 11,
4 §§ 4, 7; NRS 396.040) Existing law establishes the Board of Regents of the University of
5 Nevada and imposes upon the Board, and the members of the Board, certain duties. (Chapter
6 396 of NRS)
7 In addition, existing law requires each member elected or appointed to serve on the board
8 of trustees of a school district to complete a certain amount of training for professional
9 development during their term, which must contain instruction on certain topics relating to the
10 administration of public schools. (NRS 386.327)
11 Section 1 of this bill requires each member of the Board of Regents to complete [12
12 hours of training for professional development during the first year of the first term of the
13 member, and] 6 hours of training for professional development [each year thereafter] during
14 [which the member continues to serve] the first and third year of each term that the
15 member serves on the Board of Regents. Section 1 provides that the training may include
16 instruction covering various matters relating to the administration of a public system for
17 higher education, including instruction concerning the duties of the Board of Regents and
18 other persons involved in higher education, laws on ethics, laws on public records and
19 meetings, laws governing employment, financial matters and the fiduciary duties of the
20 members of the Board. Section 1 requires each member of the Board to complete each year [,]
21 that the member is required to complete training, as [a] part of the training requirement, [1
22 hour each of] training relating to: (1) the Open Meeting Law (Chapter 241 of NRS); and (2)
23 the elimination of bias and discrimination in higher education . [and society.]

Senate Amendment No. 268 to Senate Bill No. 322 Page 4
24 Existing law authorizes the Board of Regents to employ a Secretary of the Board and
25 requires the Secretary to perform certain duties. (NRS 396.090, 396.120, 396.853) Section 1
26 requires the Secretary to: (1) assist the members of the Board with completing the training for
27 professional development ; [required each year;] (2) post notice of any failure of a member of
28 the Board to complete this training on an Internet website maintained by the Board; and (3)
29 provide written notice of such failure of a member to the other members of the Board.
30 Existing law entitles each member of the Board of Regents to receive a certain salary for
31 each meeting of the Board that he or she attends. (NRS 396.070) Section 1 provides that each
32 member of the Board is entitled to receive compensation for each 3 hours of training for
33 professional development that the member completes [,] outside of a meeting of the Board,
34 subject to a maximum limit of 18 hours for each calendar year, in an amount that is equal to
35 the salary that the member is entitled to receive for each meeting of the Board that the
36 member attends.
37 [Existing law authorizes the Board of Regents to establish an account for each member of
38 the Board to use to pay for hosting expenditures that are directly related to the duties of the
39 member of the Board, including reasonable expenses for meals, beverages and small gifts.
40 (NRS 396.070) Section 2 of this bill decreases the amount of annual expenditures that a
41 member of the Board may draw from his or her account, if established, from $2,500 to
42 $2,000.]
