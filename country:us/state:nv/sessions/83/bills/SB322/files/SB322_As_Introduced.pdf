AN ACT relating to higher education; requiring each member of the

certain training for professional development; decreasing
the amount for hosting expenditures incurred by a
member of the Board of Regents that may be drawn from
a certain account established for the member; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 The Nevada Constitution requires the Legislature to provide for: (1) the
2 establishment of a State university controlled by a Board of Regents, whose duties
3 are to be prescribed by law; and (2) the election of the members of the Board of
4 Regents of Nevada. (Nev. Const. Art. 11, §§ 4, 7; NRS 396.040) Existing law
5 establishes the Board of Regents of the University of Nevada and imposes upon the
6 Board, and the members of the Board, certain duties. (Chapter 396 of NRS)
7 In addition, existing law requires each member elected or appointed to serve on
8 the board of trustees of a school district to complete a certain amount of training for
9 professional development during their term, which must contain instruction on
10 certain topics relating to the administration of public schools. (NRS 386.327)
11 Section 1 of this bill requires each member of the Board of Regents to
12 complete 12 hours of training for professional development during the first year of
13 the first term of the member, and 6 hours of training for professional development
14 each year thereafter during which the member continues to serve on the Board of
15 Regents. Section 1 provides that the training may include instruction covering
16 various matters relating to the administration of a public system for higher
17 education, including instruction concerning the duties of the Board of Regents and
18 other persons involved in higher education, laws on ethics, laws on public records

19 and meetings, laws governing employment, financial matters and the fiduciary
20 duties of the members of the Board. Section 1 requires each member of the Board
21 to complete each year, as a part of the training requirement, 1 hour each of training
22 relating to: (1) the Open Meeting Law (Chapter 241 of NRS); and (2) the
23 elimination of bias and discrimination in education and society.
24 Existing law authorizes the Board of Regents to employ a Secretary of the
25 Board and requires the Secretary to perform certain duties. (NRS 396.090, 396.120,
26 396.853) Section 1 requires the Secretary to: (1) assist the members of the Board
27 with completing the training for professional development required each year; (2)
28 post notice of any failure of a member of the Board to complete this training on an
29 Internet website maintained by the Board; and (3) provide written notice of such
30 failure of a member to the other members of the Board.
31 Existing law entitles each member of the Board of Regents to receive a certain
32 salary for each meeting of the Board that he or she attends. (NRS 396.070) Section
33 1 provides that each member of the Board is entitled to receive compensation for
34 each 3 hours of training for professional development that the member completes,
35 subject to a maximum limit of 18 hours for each year, in amount that is equal to the
36 salary that the member is entitled to receive for each meeting of the Board that the
37 member attends.
38 Existing law authorizes the Board of Regents to establish an account for each
39 member of the Board to use to pay for hosting expenditures that are directly related
40 to the duties of the member of the Board, including reasonable expenses for meals,
41 beverages and small gifts. (NRS 396.070) Section 2 of this bill decreases the
42 amount of annual expenditures that a member of the Board may draw from his or
43 her account, if established, from $2,500 to $2,000.
