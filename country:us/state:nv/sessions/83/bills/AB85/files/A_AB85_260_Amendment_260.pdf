Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes certain provisions governing the management of wildlife in this
2 State by the Board of Wildlife Commissioners, commonly known as the “Commission,” and
3 the Department of Wildlife. (Chapter 501 of NRS) This bill expands the wildlife managed by
4 the Commission and Department to include designated invertebrates. As a result of the
5 inclusion of designated invertebrates, certain fees and penalties that apply to violations of
6 certain provisions of existing law relating to wildlife will also apply to violations related to
7 designated invertebrates. (See, e.g., NRS 501.385, 502.240, 504.295)
8 Section 2 of this bill defines “designated invertebrate” to mean any [nonpest] species of
9 invertebrate designated as a species of greatest conservation need in the State Wildlife Action
10 Plan [.] , not including pests, as defined in section 2.5 of this bill. Section 3 of this bill
11 defines “State Wildlife Action Plan.” Section 5 of this bill revises the definition of “wildlife”
12 to include designated invertebrates.
13 Section 3.5 of this bill requires the Department, in preparing the State Wildlife
14 Action Plan, to coordinate with the State Department of Agriculture and consider the
15 Nevada Managed Pollinator Protection Plan prepared by the State Department of
16 Agriculture.
17 Section 4 of this bill applies the definitions in sections 2 , 2.5 and 3 to the provisions of
18 existing law that govern wildlife.

Assembly Amendment No. 260 to Assembly Bill No. 85 Page 4
19 Existing law requires: (1) wildlife to be classified into certain categories; and (2) the
20 Commission to place each species of wildlife in a classification by regulation. (NRS 501.110)
21 Section 6 of this bill establishes a classification for designated invertebrates.
22 Existing law provides that if the Commission determines that the existence of a species or
23 subspecies of native fish, wildlife and other fauna is endangered and its survival requires
24 assistance, the Commission must place the animal on the list of fully protected species and the
25 animal may not be captured, removed or destroyed except by means of a special permit issued
26 by the Department. (NRS 503.585) Sections 7 and 8 of this bill provide for the placement of
27 designated invertebrates on the list of fully protected species.
28 Existing law: (1) requires the Commission and Director of the Department to carry out a
29 program for conserving, protecting, restoring and propagating selected species of native fish,
30 wildlife and other vertebrates and their habitats which are threatened with extinction and
31 destruction; and (2) authorizes the Director to cooperate and enter into agreements with other
32 states, counties and legal entities in carrying out the program. (NRS 503.587, 503.589)
33 Sections 9 and 10 of this bill require the Commission and Director to include designated
34 invertebrates in the program.
