2 wildlife in this State by the Board of Wildlife Commissioners, commonly known as
3 the “Commission,” and the Department of Wildlife. (Chapter 501 of NRS) This bill
4 expands the wildlife managed by the Commission and Department to include
5 designated invertebrates. As a result of the inclusion of designated invertebrates,
6 certain fees and penalties that apply to violations of certain provisions of existing
7 law relating to wildlife will also apply to violations related to designated
8 invertebrates. (See, e.g., NRS 501.385, 502.240, 504.295)
9 Section 2 of this bill defines “designated invertebrate” to mean any nonpest
10 species of invertebrate designated as a species of greatest conservation need in the
11 State Wildlife Action Plan. Section 3 of this bill defines “State Wildlife Action
12 Plan.” Section 5 of this bill revises the definition of “wildlife” to include
13 designated invertebrates.
14 Section 4 of this bill applies the definitions in sections 2 and 3 to the
15 provisions of existing law that govern wildlife.
16 Existing law requires: (1) wildlife to be classified into certain categories; and
17 (2) the Commission to place each species of wildlife in a classification by

18 regulation. (NRS 501.110) Section 6 of this bill establishes a classification for
19 designated invertebrates.
20 Existing law provides that if the Commission determines that the existence of a
21 species or subspecies of native fish, wildlife and other fauna is endangered and its
22 survival requires assistance, the Commission must place the animal on the list of
23 fully protected species and the animal may not be captured, removed or destroyed
24 except by means of a special permit issued by the Department. (NRS 503.585)
25 Sections 7 and 8 of this bill provide for the placement of designated invertebrates
26 on the list of fully protected species.
27 Existing law: (1) requires the Commission and Director of the Department to
28 carry out a program for conserving, protecting, restoring and propagating selected
29 species of native fish, wildlife and other vertebrates and their habitats which are
30 threatened with extinction and destruction; and (2) authorizes the Director to
31 cooperate and enter into agreements with other states, counties and legal entities in
32 carrying out the program. (NRS 503.587, 503.589) Sections 9 and 10 of this bill
