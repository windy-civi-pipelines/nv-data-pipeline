FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to taxation; revising provisions governing the
effectuation of additional annual increases in certain taxes
imposed on fuels for motor vehicles in certain larger
counties; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes counties to impose certain taxes on motor vehicle fuels
2 and special fuels used in motor vehicles. (Chapter 373 of NRS) Existing law
3 authorizes the board of county commissioners of a county whose population is
4 700,000 or more (currently only Clark County) to impose, upon approval by a two-
5 thirds majority of the members of the board, additional taxes on motor vehicle fuel
6 and various special fuels used in motor vehicles and to provide for annual increases
7 in those taxes based on a certain measure of increases in the cost of highway
8 and street construction. Existing law provides that, for the period beginning on
9 January 1, 2027, additional annual increases in these taxes may not be effectuated
10 unless a majority of the voters in the county at the general election in November
11 2026 authorize the board of county commissioners to continue to provide for the
12 annual increases. (NRS 373.0663)
13 Instead of requiring the approval of a majority of the voters in the county to
14 continue to provide for the annual increases on and after January 1, 2027, this bill
15 authorizes the continued imposition of additional increases in these taxes if the
16 board of county commissioners, on or before December 31, 2026, adopts an
17 ordinance approved by a two-thirds majority of the board authorizing the
18 effectuation of such annual increases. This bill provides that, if the board of county
19 commissioners does not adopt such an ordinance on or before December 31, 2026,
20 the board is prohibited from imposing any additional annual increases in these
21 taxes. This bill also provides that, for the period beginning on January 1, 2037,
22 additional annual increases in these taxes may not be effectuated unless a majority

23 of the voters in the county at the general election in November 2036 authorize the
24 board of county commissioners to continue to provide for the annual increases.
