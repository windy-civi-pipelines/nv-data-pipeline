SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to the imposition by certain counties of
additional taxes on fuels for motor vehicles. (BDR 32-783)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to taxation; revising provisions governing the effectuation of
additional annual increases in certain taxes imposed on fuels for motor
vehicles in certain larger counties; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes counties to impose certain taxes on motor vehicle fuels and
2 special fuels used in motor vehicles. (Chapter 373 of NRS) Existing law authorizes the board
3 of county commissioners of a county whose population is 700,000 or more (currently only
4 Clark County) to impose, upon approval by a two-thirds majority of the members of the
5 board, additional taxes on motor vehicle fuel and various special fuels used in motor vehicles
6 and to provide for annual increases in those taxes based on a certain measure of increases in
7 the cost of highway and street construction. Existing law provides that, for the period
8 beginning on January 1, 2027, additional annual increases in these taxes may not be
9 effectuated unless a majority of the voters in the county at the general election in November
10 2026 authorize the board of county commissioners to continue to provide for the annual
11 increases. (NRS 373.0663)
12 Instead of requiring the approval of a majority of the voters in the county to continue to
13 provide for the annual increases on and after January 1, 2027, this bill authorizes the
14 continued imposition of additional increases in these taxes if the board of county
15 commissioners, on or before December 31, 2026, adopts an ordinance approved by a two-
16 thirds majority of the board authorizing the effectuation of such annual increases. This bill
17 provides that, if the board of county commissioners does not adopt such an ordinance on or
18 before December 31, 2026, the board is prohibited from imposing any additional annual
19 increases in these taxes. This bill also provides that, for the period beginning on January 1,
20 2037, additional annual increases in these taxes may not be effectuated unless a majority of
21 the voters in the county at the general election in November 2036 authorize the board of
22 county commissioners to continue to provide for the annual increases.
