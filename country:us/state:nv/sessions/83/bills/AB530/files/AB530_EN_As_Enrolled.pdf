Assembly Bill No. 530–Committee
on Growth and Infrastructure
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to taxation; revising provisions governing the
effectuation of additional annual increases in certain taxes
imposed on fuels for motor vehicles in certain larger
counties; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law authorizes counties to impose certain taxes on motor vehicle fuels
and special fuels used in motor vehicles. (Chapter 373 of NRS) Existing law
authorizes the board of county commissioners of a county whose population is
700,000 or more (currently only Clark County) to impose, upon approval by a two-
thirds majority of the members of the board, additional taxes on motor vehicle fuel
and various special fuels used in motor vehicles and to provide for annual increases
in those taxes based on a certain measure of increases in the cost of highway
and street construction. Existing law provides that, for the period beginning on
January 1, 2027, additional annual increases in these taxes may not be effectuated
unless a majority of the voters in the county at the general election in November
2026 authorize the board of county commissioners to continue to provide for the
annual increases. (NRS 373.0663)
Instead of requiring the approval of a majority of the voters in the county to
continue to provide for the annual increases on and after January 1, 2027, this bill
authorizes the continued imposition of additional increases in these taxes if the
board of county commissioners, on or before December 31, 2026, adopts an
ordinance approved by a two-thirds majority of the board authorizing the
effectuation of such annual increases. This bill provides that, if the board of county
commissioners does not adopt such an ordinance on or before December 31, 2026,
the board is prohibited from imposing any additional annual increases in these
taxes. This bill also provides that, for the period beginning on January 1, 2037,
additional annual increases in these taxes may not be effectuated unless a majority
of the voters in the county at the general election in November 2036 authorize the
board of county commissioners to continue to provide for the annual increases.
