EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to charter schools; revising provisions governing
the circumstances in which the sponsor of a charter school
that receives certain performance ratings under the
statewide system of accountability for public schools is
required to terminate the charter contract of the charter
school or restart the charter school under a new charter
contract; temporarily providing that the sponsor of a
charter school that receives certain performance ratings
under the statewide system of accountability for public
schools is not required to terminate the contract of the
charter school or restart the charter school under a new
charter contract if the charter school achieves certain
ratings or increases a rating from the immediately
preceding school year; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires each public school, including, without limitation, a
2 charter school, to be rated pursuant to the statewide system of accountability for
3 public schools. (NRS 385A.600) Existing law also requires the sponsor of a charter
4 school to terminate the charter contract or restart the charter school under a new
5 charter contract if the charter school receives certain ratings indicating
6 underperformance of the charter school in 3 years out of any 5 consecutive years.
7 (NRS 388A.300) Section 1 of this bill: (1) instead provides that the sponsor of a
8 charter school is required to terminate the charter contract or restart the charter
9 school under a new charter contract if the charter school receives certain ratings
10 indicating underperformance of the charter school in 3 consecutive years; and (2)
11 eliminates the prohibition on using the rating of a charter school issued for any
12 school year before the 2015-2016 school year for making such a determination.

16 of accountability for public schools, the charter school receives certain ratings or
17 increases a rating from the immediately preceding school year by a certain
