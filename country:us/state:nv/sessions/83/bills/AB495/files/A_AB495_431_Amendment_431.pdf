EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to charter schools; providing that the sponsor of a charter school
that receives certain performance ratings under the statewide system of
accountability for public schools is not required to terminate the
charter contract of the charter school or restart the charter school under
a new charter contract if [the sponsor determines that] the charter
school [is demonstrating progress towards meeting certain school
achievement targets and performance targets;] achieves certain
ratings or increases a rating from the immediately preceding
school year; requiring the Department of Education to establish a
committee to evaluate and recommend revisions to the statewide
system of accountability for public schools; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires each public school, including, without limitation, a charter school,
2 to be rated pursuant to the statewide system of accountability for public schools. (NRS
3 385A.600) Existing law also requires the sponsor of a charter school to terminate the charter
4 contract or restart the charter school under a new charter contract if the charter school receives
5 certain ratings indicating underperformance of the charter school in 3 years out of any 5
6 consecutive years. (NRS 388A.300) [This] Section 1 of this bill , until October 1, 2026: (1)
7 instead provides that the sponsor of [such] a charter school is [not] required to terminate the
8 charter contract or restart the charter school under a new charter contract if the [sponsor
9 determines that the charter school is demonstrating progress towards meeting at least two of
10 the school achievement targets and performance targets that are established] charter school
11 receives certain ratings indicating underperformance of the charter school in 3
12 consecutive years; and (2) eliminates the prohibition on using the rating of a charter
13 school issued for any school year before the 2015-2016 school year for making such a
14 determination. Section 1 also provides that the sponsor of such a charter school is not
15 required to terminate the charter contract or restart the charter school under a new
16 charter contract if, pursuant to the statewide system of accountability for public schools [.] ,
17 the charter school receives certain ratings or increases a rating from the immediately
18 preceding school year by a certain percentage.
19 Section 2 of this bill: (1) requires the Department of Education to establish a
20 committee to evaluate and recommend revisions to the statewide system of
21 accountability for public schools; (2) sets forth the membership of the committee; and

Assembly Amendment No. 431 to Assembly Bill No. 495 Page 4
22 (3) sets forth the topics for the committee to evaluate. Section 2 additionally: (1) requires
23 the committee to submit a report describing its findings to certain entities; and (2)
24 provides that the committee is dissolved after submitting the report.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 388A.300 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 388A.300 1. Except as otherwise provided in [subsection] subsections 5
3 and 6 , [and 7,] subsection 3 of NRS 385A.720 and subsection 6 of NRS 388A.274,
4 the sponsor of a charter school shall terminate the charter contract of the charter
5 school or restart the charter school under a new charter contract if the charter school
6 receives, in any period of [5] 3 consecutive school years, three annual ratings
7 established as the lowest rating possible indicating underperformance of a public
8 school, as determined by the Department pursuant to the statewide system of
9 accountability for public schools.
10 2. [A charter school’s annual rating pursuant to the statewide system of
11 accountability based upon the performance of the charter school must not be
12 included in the count of annual ratings for the purposes of subsection 1 for any
13 school year before the 2015-2016 school year.
14 3.] If a charter contract is terminated or a charter school is restarted pursuant
15 to subsection 1, the sponsor of the charter school shall submit a written report to the
16 Department and the governing body of the charter school setting forth the reasons
17 for the termination or restart of the charter school not later than 10 days after
18 terminating the charter contract or restarting the charter school.
19 [4.] 3. The provisions of NRS 388A.330 do not apply to the termination of a

25 was restarted before any other eligible pupil is enrolled.
26 [6.] 5. If the sponsor of a charter school determines that not all of the
27 elementary, middle or high schools in or campuses of the charter school meet the
28 criteria described in subsection 1 and that the charter school can remain financially
29 viable if the charter school continues to operate and serve only the elementary,
30 middle or high schools or campuses which do not meet the criteria described in
31 subsection 1, the sponsor may amend the charter contract to eliminate the
32 elementary, middle or high schools or campuses that meet the criteria described in
33 subsection 1 and limit the enrollment in all other elementary, middle or high
34 schools in or campuses of the charter school.
35 [7.] 6. The sponsor of a charter school described in subsection 1 is not
36 required to terminate the charter contract of the charter school or restart the

39 school achievement targets and performance targets established pursuant to the
40 statewide system of accountability for public schools.] the charter school received
41 a rating that is:
