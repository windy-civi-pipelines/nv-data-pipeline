EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to charter schools; providing that the sponsor of a
charter school that receives certain performance ratings
under the statewide system of accountability for public
schools is not required to terminate the charter contract of
the charter school or restart the charter school under a
new charter contract if the charter school achieves certain
ratings or increases a rating from the immediately
preceding school year; requiring the Department of
Education to establish a committee to evaluate and
recommend revisions to the statewide system of
accountability for public schools; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires each public school, including, without limitation, a
2 charter school, to be rated pursuant to the statewide system of accountability for
3 public schools. (NRS 385A.600) Existing law also requires the sponsor of a charter
4 school to terminate the charter contract or restart the charter school under a new
5 charter contract if the charter school receives certain ratings indicating
6 underperformance of the charter school in 3 years out of any 5 consecutive years.
7 (NRS 388A.300) Section 1 of this bill, until October 1, 2026: (1) instead provides
8 that the sponsor of a charter school is required to terminate the charter contract or
9 restart the charter school under a new charter contract if the charter school receives
10 certain ratings indicating underperformance of the charter school in 3 consecutive
11 years; and (2) eliminates the prohibition on using the rating of a charter school
12 issued for any school year before the 2015-2016 school year for making such a
13 determination. Section 1 also provides that the sponsor of such a charter school is
14 not required to terminate the charter contract or restart the charter school under a
15 new charter contract if, pursuant to the statewide system of accountability for
-

16 public schools, the charter school receives certain ratings or increases a rating from
17 the immediately preceding school year by a certain percentage.

19 committee to evaluate and recommend revisions to the statewide system of
20 accountability for public schools; (2) sets forth the membership of the committee;
21 and (3) sets forth the topics for the committee to evaluate. Section 2 additionally:
22 (1) requires the committee to submit a report describing its findings to certain
23 entities; and (2) provides that the committee is dissolved after submitting the report.
