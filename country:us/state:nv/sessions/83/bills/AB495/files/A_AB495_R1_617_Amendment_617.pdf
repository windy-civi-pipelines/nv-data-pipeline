EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to charter schools; [providing that] revising provisions
governing the circumstances in which the sponsor of a charter school
that receives certain performance ratings under the statewide system of
accountability for public schools is [not] required to terminate the
charter contract of the charter school or restart the charter school under
a new charter contract ; temporarily providing that the sponsor of a
charter school that receives certain performance ratings under the
statewide system of accountability for public schools is not
required to terminate the contract of the charter school or restart
the charter school under a new charter contract if the charter school
achieves certain ratings or increases a rating from the immediately
preceding school year; [requiring the Department of Education to
establish a committee to evaluate and recommend revisions to the
statewide system of accountability for public schools;] and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires each public school, including, without limitation, a charter school,
2 to be rated pursuant to the statewide system of accountability for public schools. (NRS
3 385A.600) Existing law also requires the sponsor of a charter school to terminate the charter
4 contract or restart the charter school under a new charter contract if the charter school receives
5 certain ratings indicating underperformance of the charter school in 3 years out of any 5
6 consecutive years. (NRS 388A.300) Section 1 of this bill : [, until October 1, 2026:] (1)
7 instead provides that the sponsor of a charter school is required to terminate the charter
8 contract or restart the charter school under a new charter contract if the charter school receives
9 certain ratings indicating underperformance of the charter school in 3 consecutive years; and
10 (2) eliminates the prohibition on using the rating of a charter school issued for any school year
11 before the 2015-2016 school year for making such a determination. [Section] Sections 1 and
12 1.5 of this bill also [provides] provide that , until October 1, 2027, the sponsor of such a
13 charter school is not required to terminate the charter contract or restart the charter school
14 under a new charter contract if, pursuant to the statewide system of accountability for public
15 schools, the charter school receives certain ratings or increases a rating from the immediately
16 preceding school year by a certain percentage.

18 to evaluate and recommend revisions to the statewide system of accountability for public
19 schools; (2) sets forth the membership of the committee; and (3) sets forth the topics for the
20 committee to evaluate. Section 2 additionally: (1) requires the committee to submit a report
21 describing its findings to certain entities; and (2) provides that the committee is dissolved after
