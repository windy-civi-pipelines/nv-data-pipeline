AN ACT relating to charter schools; providing that the sponsor of a
charter school that receives certain performance ratings
under the statewide system of accountability for public
schools is not required to terminate the charter contract of
the charter school or restart the charter school under a
new charter contract if the sponsor determines that the

certain school achievement targets and performance
targets; and providing other matters properly relating

1 Existing law requires each public school, including, without limitation, a
2 charter school, to be rated pursuant to the statewide system of accountability for
3 public schools. (NRS 385A.600) Existing law also requires the sponsor of a charter
4 school to terminate the charter contract or restart the charter school under a new
5 charter contract if the charter school receives certain ratings indicating
6 underperformance of the charter school in 3 years out of any 5 consecutive years.
7 (NRS 388A.300) This bill provides that the sponsor of such a charter school is not
8 required to terminate the charter contract or restart the charter school under a new
9 charter contract if the sponsor determines that the charter school is demonstrating
10 progress towards meeting at least two of the school achievement targets and
11 performance targets that are established pursuant to the statewide system of
12 accountability for public schools.
