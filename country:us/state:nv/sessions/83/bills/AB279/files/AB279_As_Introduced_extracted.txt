Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law makes it a crime for a person to knowingly sell or possess for the
2 purpose of sale a contraband tobacco product. (NRS 370.405) Existing law also
3 makes it a crime for a person to otherwise import, export, possess or constructively
4 possess a contraband tobacco product. (NRS 370.410) Section 3 of this bill
5 includes as a contraband tobacco product a vapor product that has not been
6 approved by the Federal Government for introduction or delivery for introduction
7 into interstate commerce. Section 3 thereby makes it a crime for a person to: (1)
8 sell or possess for the purpose of sale such a vapor product; and (2) otherwise
9 import, export, possess or constructively possess such a vapor product. Section 1 of
10 this bill requires the Department of Taxation to create and maintain on its Internet
11 website and otherwise make available for public inspection a directory that lists
12 each vapor product that has been approved by the United States Secretary of Health
13 and Human Services for introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate
14 commerce. Section 2 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law governing
15 cigarettes to section 1.
16 Existing law: (1) prohibits a person from selling, distributing or offering to sell
17 cigarettes, cigarette paper or various other products derived from nicotine to any
18 person under the age of 21 years; (2) provides for the imposition of a civil penalty

19 against a person or business that violates that prohibition; and (3) makes it a
20 misdemeanor to knowingly sell or distribute such products to a person under the
21 age of 21 years through the use of a computer network, telephonic network or other
22 electronic network. (NRS 202.24935, 370.321, 370.521) Sections 4 and 6 of this
23 bill additionally prohibit the sale, distribution or offer for sale of cigarettes to any
24 person who was born after December 31, 2004, unless the sale, distribution or offer
25 to sell occurs on the premises of a property where gaming is conducted under a
26 nonrestricted license for gaming. Sections 5 and 7 of this bill make certain
27 revisions to provisions which facilitate compliance with and enforcement of the
28 existing prohibition on the sale, distribution or offer for sale of cigarettes and
29 certain other products to persons under the age of 21 years to apply those
30 provisions to the sale of cigarettes to persons born after December 31, 2004.
31 Existing law authorizes a board of county commissioners to adopt an ordinance
32 to prohibit a child who is under 18 years of age from: (1) purchasing, attempting to
33 purchase, possessing, attempting to possess or using tobacco products; or (2) falsely
34 representing his or her age to purchase, obtain or possess tobacco products. (NRS
35 244.3572) Section 8 of this bill authorizes a board of county commissioners to
36 adopt such an ordinance concerning a person who is under 21 years of age in
37 accordance with existing state law prohibiting the sale of tobacco products to such a
38 person. (NRS 202.24935, 370.521) Section 8 also authorizes a board of county
39 commissioners to adopt such an ordinance prohibiting a person born after
40 December 31, 2004, from: (1) purchasing, attempting to purchase, possessing,
41 attempting to possess or smoking cigarettes, except on the premises of a property
42 where gaming is conducted under a nonrestricted license for gaming; or (2) falsely
43 representing his or her age to purchase, obtain or possess cigarettes.

ASSEMBLY BILL NO. 279–ASSEMBLYMEMBERS
ORENTLICHER; AND GONZÁLEZ
FEBRUARY 24, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Revenue
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to tobacco.
(BDR 32-158)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to tobacco; prohibiting the sale, import, export,
possession or constructive possession of certain vapor
products; prohibiting the sale of cigarettes to persons born
after a certain date except on the premises of certain
gaming establishments; revising provisions authorizing
boards of county commissioners to adopt certain
ordinances related to tobacco products; providing
penalties; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law makes it a crime for a person to knowingly sell or possess for the
2 purpose of sale a contraband tobacco product. (NRS 370.405) Existing law also
3 makes it a crime for a person to otherwise import, export, possess or constructively
4 possess a contraband tobacco product. (NRS 370.410) Section 3 of this bill
5 includes as a contraband tobacco product a vapor product that has not been
6 approved by the Federal Government for introduction or delivery for introduction
7 into interstate commerce. Section 3 thereby makes it a crime for a person to: (1)
8 sell or possess for the purpose of sale such a vapor product; and (2) otherwise
9 import, export, possess or constructively possess such a vapor product. Section 1 of
10 this bill requires the Department of Taxation to create and maintain on its Internet
11 website and otherwise make available for public inspection a directory that lists
12 each vapor product that has been approved by the United States Secretary of Health
13 and Human Services for introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate
14 commerce. Section 2 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law governing
15 cigarettes to section 1.
16 Existing law: (1) prohibits a person from selling, distributing or offering to sell
17 cigarettes, cigarette paper or various other products derived from nicotine to any
18 person under the age of 21 years; (2) provides for the imposition of a civil penalty
-
*AB279*

– 2 –
19 against a person or business that violates that prohibition; and (3) makes it a
20 misdemeanor to knowingly sell or distribute such products to a person under the
21 age of 21 years through the use of a computer network, telephonic network or other
22 electronic network. (NRS 202.24935, 370.321, 370.521) Sections 4 and 6 of this
23 bill additionally prohibit the sale, distribution or offer for sale of cigarettes to any
24 person who was born after December 31, 2004, unless the sale, distribution or offer
25 to sell occurs on the premises of a property where gaming is conducted under a
26 nonrestricted license for gaming. Sections 5 and 7 of this bill make certain
27 revisions to provisions which facilitate compliance with and enforcement of the
28 existing prohibition on the sale, distribution or offer for sale of cigarettes and
29 certain other products to persons under the age of 21 years to apply those
30 provisions to the sale of cigarettes to persons born after December 31, 2004.
31 Existing law authorizes a board of county commissioners to adopt an ordinance
32 to prohibit a child who is under 18 years of age from: (1) purchasing, attempting to
33 purchase, possessing, attempting to possess or using tobacco products; or (2) falsely
34 representing his or her age to purchase, obtain or possess tobacco products. (NRS
35 244.3572) Section 8 of this bill authorizes a board of county commissioners to
36 adopt such an ordinance concerning a person who is under 21 years of age in
37 accordance with existing state law prohibiting the sale of tobacco products to such a
38 person. (NRS 202.24935, 370.521) Section 8 also authorizes a board of county
39 commissioners to adopt such an ordinance prohibiting a person born after
40 December 31, 2004, from: (1) purchasing, attempting to purchase, possessing,
41 attempting to possess or smoking cigarettes, except on the premises of a property
42 where gaming is conducted under a nonrestricted license for gaming; or (2) falsely
43 representing his or her age to purchase, obtain or possess cigarettes.

8 pursuant to 21 U.S.C. § 387j.

12 3. Any determination of the Department not to include in or
