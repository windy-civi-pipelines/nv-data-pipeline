AN ACT relating to wildlife; requiring the Board of Wildlife Commissioners to
adopt regulations providing for the issuance of salvage permits;
providing an exception to certain prohibitions relating to wildlife; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Board of Wildlife Commissioners to establish certain policies and
2 adopt certain regulations to carry out and to enforce certain provisions relating to wildlife. (NRS
3 501.181) Section 1 of this bill: (1) requires the Commission to adopt regulations requiring the
4 Department of Wildlife to issue salvage permits that authorize a person to salvage and collect any
5 wildlife killed as a result of a vehicle collision [;] or any other incidental event; and (2)
6 prohibits the Commission from prescribing a fee for the issuance of a salvage permit. Section 1
7 additionally provides that the Commission may, by regulation, prohibit the Department from
8 issuing salvage permits if any wildlife in this State is confirmed to have tested positive for
9 chronic wasting disease.
10 In addition to regular hunting licenses and trapping licenses, existing law requires a person
11 to have a tag to hunt certain species of game mammals and authorizes the Commission to require
12 tags in certain other circumstances. (NRS 502.130) If tags are required, existing law prohibits a
13 person from possessing any of that species, or parts thereof, without the correct tag. (NRS
14 502.150) Subject to certain exceptions, existing law prohibits any person from having in his or
15 her control any wildlife or any part thereof, during the time when the killing of such wildlife is
16 prohibited. (NRS 503.030) Sections 2 and 3 of this bill provide that a person holding a salvage
17 permit issued by regulation of the Commission adopted pursuant to section 1 is exempted from
18 those prohibitions.

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 501 of NRS is hereby amended by adding thereto a new
2 section to read as follows:
3 1. The Commission shall adopt regulations requiring the Department to
4 issue salvage permits that authorize a person to salvage and collect any wildlife
5 killed as a result of a vehicle collision [.] or any other incidental event. The
6 regulations adopted by the Commission pursuant to this section may prohibit the
7 Department from issuing salvage permits if any wildlife in this State is confirmed
8 to have tested positive for chronic wasting disease.
9 2. The Commission may not prescribe a fee for the issuance of a salvage
10 permit pursuant to the regulations of the Commission adopted pursuant to this
11 section.
12 Sec. 2. NRS 502.150 is hereby amended to read as follows:
13 502.150 1. [Whenever] Except as otherwise provided in the regulations
14 adopted by the Commission pursuant to section 1 of this act, whenever tags are
15 required for any species of wildlife, it is unlawful to have any of that species in
16 possession without the correct tag. Before transporting any species of wildlife, or
17 parts thereof, for which a tag is required, the holder of:
18 (a) A paper tag must attach the tag to the animal; or
19 (b) An electronic tag must validate the tag in accordance with the regulations
20 adopted by the Commission pursuant to NRS 502.160.
21  Possession of any species of wildlife, or parts thereof, for which a tag is required
22 without an attached or validated tag, as applicable, is prima facie evidence that the
23 game is illegally taken and possessed.
24 2. It is unlawful to remove any tag from any wildlife for reuse or to be in
25 possession of excess tags or used tags.
26 3. [Whenever] Except as otherwise provided in the regulations adopted by
27 the Commission [adopted] pursuant to section 1 of this act, whenever tags are
28 required for any species of fur-bearing mammal, possession of a pelt of that species
29 without the tag attached thereto or validated, as applicable, is prima facie evidence
30 that such pelt is illegally taken and possessed.
31 Sec. 3. NRS 503.030 is hereby amended to read as follows:
32 503.030 1. Except as otherwise provided in this section [,] or in the
33 regulations adopted by the Commission pursuant to section 1 of this act, it is
34 unlawful for any person to have in his or her control any wildlife or any part
35 thereof, the killing of which is at any time prohibited, during the time when such
36 killing is prohibited, and the possession of such wildlife shall be prima facie
37 evidence that it was the property of the State at the time it was caught, taken or
38 killed in this State when the killing was unlawful, and that such taking or killing
39 occurred in the closed season.
40 2. Wildlife legally taken may be stored in the home of the owner after the end
41 of the open season for hunting or fishing for it and may be stored in a public
42 warehouse or commercial refrigerator locker under such rules as may be adopted by
43 the Commission, but in no case shall more than the amount designated by law as
44 the legal possession limit be so kept or stored.
45 3. The Commission is authorized to make rules requiring evidence of legal
46 taking in this State, or legal taking under the laws of the state where taken, to be
47 provided in the case of wildlife kept or stored after the appropriate open season
48 ends in the form of tags, certificates or otherwise, if deemed necessary or
49 convenient for the enforcement of this title.
