AN ACT relating to wildlife; requiring the Board of Wildlife
Commissioners to adopt regulations providing for the
issuance of salvage permits; providing an exception to
certain prohibitions relating to wildlife; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Board of Wildlife Commissioners to establish certain
2 policies and adopt certain regulations to carry out and to enforce certain provisions
3 relating to wildlife. (NRS 501.181) Section 1 of this bill: (1) requires the Commission
4 to adopt regulations requiring the Department of Wildlife to issue salvage permits that
5 authorize a person to salvage and collect any wildlife killed as a result of a vehicle
6 collision; and (2) prohibits the Commission from prescribing a fee for the issuance of
7 a salvage permit. Section 1 additionally provides that the Commission may, by
8 regulation, prohibit the Department from issuing salvage permits if any wildlife in this
9 State is confirmed to have tested positive for chronic wasting disease.
10 In addition to regular hunting licenses and trapping licenses, existing law requires
11 a person to have a tag to hunt certain species of game mammals and authorizes the
12 Commission to require tags in certain other circumstances. (NRS 502.130) If tags are
13 required, existing law prohibits a person from possessing any of that species, or parts
14 thereof, without the correct tag. (NRS 502.150) Subject to certain exceptions, existing
15 law prohibits any person from having in his or her control any wildlife or any part
16 thereof, during the time when the killing of such wildlife is prohibited. (NRS 503.030)
17 Sections 2 and 3 of this bill provide that a person holding a salvage permit issued by
18 regulation of the Commission adopted pursuant to section 1 is exempted from those
19 prohibitions.

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 501 of NRS is hereby amended by adding
2 thereto a new section to read as follows:
3 1. The Commission shall adopt regulations requiring the
4 Department to issue salvage permits that authorize a person to
5 salvage and collect any wildlife killed as a result of a vehicle
6 collision. The regulations adopted by the Commission pursuant to
7 this section may prohibit the Department from issuing salvage
8 permits if any wildlife in this State is confirmed to have tested
9 positive for chronic wasting disease.
10 2. The Commission may not prescribe a fee for the issuance
11 of a salvage permit pursuant to the regulations of the Commission
12 adopted pursuant to this section.
13 Sec. 2. NRS 502.150 is hereby amended to read as follows:
14 502.150 1. [Whenever] Except as otherwise provided in the
15 regulations adopted by the Commission pursuant to section 1 of
16 this act, whenever tags are required for any species of wildlife, it is
17 unlawful to have any of that species in possession without the
18 correct tag. Before transporting any species of wildlife, or parts
19 thereof, for which a tag is required, the holder of:
20 (a) A paper tag must attach the tag to the animal; or
21 (b) An electronic tag must validate the tag in accordance with
22 the regulations adopted by the Commission pursuant to
23 NRS 502.160.
24  Possession of any species of wildlife, or parts thereof, for which a
25 tag is required without an attached or validated tag, as applicable, is
26 prima facie evidence that the game is illegally taken and possessed.
27 2. It is unlawful to remove any tag from any wildlife for reuse
28 or to be in possession of excess tags or used tags.
29 3. [Whenever] Except as otherwise provided in the
30 regulations adopted by the Commission adopted pursuant to
31 section 1 of this act, whenever tags are required for any species of
32 fur-bearing mammal, possession of a pelt of that species without the
33 tag attached thereto or validated, as applicable, is prima facie
34 evidence that such pelt is illegally taken and possessed.
35 Sec. 3. NRS 503.030 is hereby amended to read as follows:
36 503.030 1. Except as otherwise provided in this section [,] or
37 in the regulations adopted by the Commission pursuant to section
38 1 of this act, it is unlawful for any person to have in his or her
39 control any wildlife or any part thereof, the killing of which is at any
40 time prohibited, during the time when such killing is prohibited, and
41 the possession of such wildlife shall be prima facie evidence that it
42 was the property of the State at the time it was caught, taken or

2 taking or killing occurred in the closed season.
3 2. Wildlife legally taken may be stored in the home of the
4 owner after the end of the open season for hunting or fishing for it
5 and may be stored in a public warehouse or commercial refrigerator
6 locker under such rules as may be adopted by the Commission, but
7 in no case shall more than the amount designated by law as the legal
8 possession limit be so kept or stored.
9 3. The Commission is authorized to make rules requiring
10 evidence of legal taking in this State, or legal taking under the laws
11 of the state where taken, to be provided in the case of wildlife kept
12 or stored after the appropriate open season ends in the form of tags,
13 certificates or otherwise, if deemed necessary or convenient for the
14 enforcement of this title.
