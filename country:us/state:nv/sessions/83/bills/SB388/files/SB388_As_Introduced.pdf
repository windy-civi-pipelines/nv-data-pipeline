EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; revising provisions relating to cost-
sharing requirements for families receiving assistance
under the Program for Child Care and Development; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing federal law establishes the Child Care and Development Block Grant
2 Act of 1990, a program that provides block grants to states to provide child care
3 services for certain children. (42 U.S.C. §§ 9857 et seq.) To receive such a block
4 grant, a state is required to submit a state plan that meets certain requirements and
5 outlines the services that the state proposes to fund using the grant. (42 U.S.C. §
6 9858c) Existing Nevada law requires the Department of Health and Human
7 Services to administer the Program for Child Care and Development in this State.
8 (NRS 422A.338) Under existing federal law, the state plan for the Program is
9 required to include, among other requirements, a sliding fee scale that provides for
10 cost sharing by the families that receive assistance under the Program. (42 U.S.C. §
11 9858c(c)(5)) This bill: (1) requires that the sliding fee scale provide that no cost
12 sharing is required for a family with an income in one of the four lowest brackets of
13 the sliding fee scale; and (2) provides that such cost sharing must not exceed 5
14 percent of the gross income of the family.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 422A.630 is hereby amended to read as
2 follows:
