19

23 committees must be open to the public.

25 character, alleged misconduct, professional competence, or
26 physical or mental health of a person.
27
28 Rule No. 14. Convening of Senate between Legislative
29 Sessions.
30 1. The Senate may be convened at any time between sessions
31 of the Legislature upon a petition signed by a majority of the
32 members elected to the Senate to consider and take action on any
33 matter that is solely and exclusively within the constitutional or
34 inherent powers of the Senate, including, without limitation, any
35 matter that may be considered and acted on by the Senate
36 pursuant to its plenary and exclusive constitutional powers under
37 Article 4, Section 6 of the Nevada Constitution or pursuant to its
38 inherent powers of institutional self-protection and self-
39 preservation to govern, control and regulate its membership and
40 its internal organization, affairs and management.
41 2. A petition convening the Senate pursuant to this Rule must
42 specify the matter that will be considered or acted on by the
43 Senate, indicate a date for the Senate to convene and be
44 transmitted to the Secretary of the Senate. Upon receipt of one or

-
*SR1*
– 6 –
1 majority of the members elected to the Senate, the Secretary shall
2 notify all members of the Senate that the Senate will be convened
3 pursuant to this Rule and the date on which the Senate will be
4 convened.
5 3. The Senate hereby finds and declares that:
6 (a) The Nevada Constitution invests each House of the
7 Legislature with certain plenary and exclusive constitutional
8 powers which may be exercised only by that House and which
9 cannot be usurped, infringed or impaired by the other House or by
10 any other branch of Nevada’s State Government. (Heller v.
11 Legislature, 120 Nev. 456 (2004); Commission on Ethics v. Hardy,
12 125 Nev. 285 (2009); Mason’s Manual of Legislative Procedure §§
13 2-3 & 560-564 (2010) (Mason’s Manual))
14 (b) Article 4, Section 6 of the Nevada Constitution invests each
15 House with plenary and exclusive constitutional powers to govern,
16 control and regulate its membership and its internal organization,
17 affairs and management, expressly providing that: “Each House
18 shall judge of the qualifications, elections and returns of its own
19 members, choose its own officers (except the President of the
20 Senate), determine the rules of its proceedings and may punish its
21 members for disorderly conduct, and with the concurrence of two
22 thirds of all the members elected, expel a member.”
23 (c) In addition to its plenary and exclusive constitutional
24 powers, each House possesses certain inherent powers of
25 institutional self-protection and self-preservation to govern,
26 control and regulate its membership and its internal organization,
27 affairs and management. (In re Chapman, 166 U.S. 661, 668
28 (1897); Mason’s Manual § 2; Luther S. Cushing, Elements of the
29 Law & Practice of Legislative Assemblies § 533 (1856) (Cushing’s
30 Legislative Assemblies))
31 (d) The inherent powers of each House are considered “so
32 essential to the authority of a legislative assembly, that it cannot
33 well exist without them; and they are consequently entitled to be
34 regarded as belonging to every such assembly as a necessary
35 incident.” (Cushing’s Legislative Assemblies § 533)
36 (e) The inherent powers of each House authorize it to take all
37 necessary and proper institutional actions that are “recognized by
38 the common parliamentary law.” (Cushing’s Legislative
39 Assemblies § 684)
40 (f) Thus, it is well established that each House is “vested with
41 all the powers and privileges which are necessary and incidental to
42 a free and unobstructed exercise of its appropriate functions.
43 These powers and privileges are derived not from the Constitution;
44 on the contrary, they arise from the very creation of a legislative
-
*SR1*
– 7 –
1 body, and are founded upon the principle of self-preservation.”

6 III. DECORUM AND DEBATE
7
8 Rule No. 20. Points of Order.
9 1. If any Senator, in speaking or otherwise, transgresses the
10 rules of the Senate, the President shall, or any Senator may, call
11 him or her to order. If a Senator is so called to order, he or she
12 shall not proceed without leave of the Senate. If such leave is
13 granted, it must be upon the motion, “That he or she be allowed to
14 proceed in order,” and the Senator shall confine himself or herself
15 to the proposal under consideration and avoid personality.
16 2. Every ruling on points of order made by the President is
17 subject to appeal, and a discussion of a question of order may be
18 allowed only upon the appeal of two Senators. In all cases of
19 appeal, the question must be, “Shall the ruling of the Chair stand
20 as the judgment of the Senate?”
21
22 Rule No. 21. Breaches of Decorum.
23 1. In cases of breaches of decorum or propriety, any Senator,
24 officer or other person is liable to such censure or punishment as
25 the Senate may deem proper.
26 2. If any Senator is called to order for offensive or indecorous
27 language or conduct, the person calling the Senator to order shall
28 report the offensive or indecorous language or conduct to the
29 presiding officer. No member may be held to answer for any
30 language used on the floor of the Senate if business has
31 intervened before exception to the language was taken.
32 3. Indecorous conduct or boisterous or unbecoming language
33 is not permitted in the Senate Chamber.
34
35 Rule No. 22. Portable Electronic Communication Devices.
36 1. A person who is within the Senate Chambers shall not
37 engage in a telephone conversation via the use of a portable
38 telephone when the Senate is convened.
39 2. Before entering the Senate Chambers, any person who
40 possesses a portable electronic communication device that emits
41 an audible alert, such as a ringing or beeping sound, to signal an
42 incoming message or call, shall turn the audible alert off. A device
43 that contains a nonaudible alert, such as a silent vibration, may be
44 operated in a nonaudible manner within the Senate Chambers.

8 appointed by the Majority Leader and one who is appointed by the

10 Legislature or employed by the State of Nevada.
11  Not more than four members of the Committee may be
12 members of the same political party.
13 2. The Majority Leader shall appoint the Chair and Vice
14 Chair of the Committee. The Vice Chair shall serve as the acting
15 Chair if the Chair is unable to serve for any reason during the
16 consideration of a specific proposal.
17 3. The Majority Leader shall appoint an alternate member
18 with the qualifications set forth in paragraph (a) of subsection 1
19 and an alternate member with the qualifications set forth in
20 paragraph (c) of subsection 1. The Minority Leader shall appoint
21 an alternate member with the qualifications set forth in paragraph
22 (b) of subsection 1 and an alternate member with the
23 qualifications set forth in paragraph (c) of subsection 1. If a
24 member of the Committee is unable to serve for any reason during
25 the consideration of a specific proposal, the alternate appointed
26 with the qualifications from the same paragraph in subsection 1
27 shall serve as a member of the Committee during the
28 consideration of the specific proposal.
29 4. A member of the Committee is disqualified to serve during
30 the consideration of a specific proposal if:
31 (a) The member is the requester of advice concerning the
32 question of ethics or conflict of interest, or the member is the
33 subject of the complaint concerning the specific question; or
34 (b) A reasonable person in the member’s situation could not
35 exercise independent judgment on the matter in question.
36 5. The members of the Committee shall perform any duty
37 required in the period between the time of their appointment after
38 the general election and the organization of the next succeeding
39 regular session, or until the Majority Leader or the Minority
40 Leader appoint new members to the Committee, whichever occurs
41 first.
42 6. The tenure of the members of the Committee shall extend
43 during the interim between regular sessions of the Legislature.
44 7. The Committee:
-
*SR1*
– 9 –
1 (a) May hear requests brought by Senators for advice on
2 specific questions of potential breaches of ethics and conflicts of
3 interest; and
4 (b) Shall hear complaints brought by Senators and others on
5 specific questions of alleged breaches of ethics and conflicts of
6 interest, including, without limitation, alleged breaches of the
7 Legislative Code of Ethical Standards in the Joint Standing Rules.
8 8. All proceedings held by the Committee to consider the
9 character, alleged misconduct, professional competence or
10 physical or mental health of any person on matters of ethics or
11 conflicts of interest and all materials related to those proceedings
12 are confidential, unless the person who is the subject of the
13 proceedings requests a public hearing or discloses the content of
14 the proceedings or materials.
15 9. An individual may file a complaint which alleges a breach
16 of ethics or a conflict of interest, including, without limitation, an
17 alleged breach of the Legislative Code of Ethical Standards in the
18 Joint Standing Rules. If the alleged breach of ethics or conflict of
19 interest involves the conduct of more than one person, separate
20 complaints must be filed regarding each person. A complaint must
21 be:
22 (a) Made in writing on a form provided by the Legislative
23 Counsel;
24 (b) Signed and verified under penalty of perjury by the
25 individual making the allegation; and
26 (c) Filed with the Legislative Counsel who shall review the
27 complaint and any other relevant information and consult with
28 the Chair of the Committee or, if the Chair is the subject of the
29 complaint, with the Vice Chair, to evaluate whether the Committee
30 has jurisdiction and whether an investigation is warranted in the
31 matter. If it is determined that the Committee:
32 (1) Does not have jurisdiction or that an investigation is not
33 warranted in the matter, the Legislative Counsel shall send written
34 notice of the determination to the individual who filed the
35 complaint.
36 (2) Has jurisdiction and an investigation is warranted in
37 the matter, the Legislative Counsel shall send written notice of the
38 determination and a copy of the complaint to the person who is the
39 subject of the complaint.
40 10. Each Legislator is subject, at all times, to the Legislative
41 Code of Ethical Standards in the Joint Standing Rules and, in
42 addition, must determine whether he or she has a conflict of
43 interest upon any matter in question before the Legislator. In
44 determining whether the Legislator has such a conflict of interest,
45 the Legislator should consider whether the independence of
-
*SR1*
– 10 –
1 judgment of a reasonable person in his or her situation upon the
2 matter in question would be materially affected by the
3 Legislator’s:
4 (a) Acceptance of a gift or loan;
5 (b) Private economic interest; or
6 (c) Commitment to a member of his or her household or
7 immediate family.
8  In interpreting and applying the provisions of this subsection, it
9 must be presumed that the independence of judgment of a
10 reasonable person in the Legislator’s situation would not be
11 materially affected by the Legislator’s private economic interest or
12 the Legislator’s commitment to a member of his or her household
13 or immediate family where the resulting benefit or detriment
14 accruing to the Legislator, or if the Legislator has a commitment
15 to a member of his or her household or immediate family,
16 accruing to those other persons, is not greater than that accruing
17 to any other member of the general business, profession,
18 occupation or group that is affected by the matter.
19 11. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 12, if a
20 Legislator knows he or she has a conflict of interest pursuant to
21 subsection 10, the Legislator shall make a disclosure of the
22 conflict of interest on the record in a meeting of a committee or on
23 the floor of the Senate, as applicable. Such a disclosure must be
24 entered:
25 (a) If the Legislator makes the disclosure in a meeting of a
26 committee, in the minutes for that meeting.
27 (b) If the Legislator makes the disclosure on the floor of the
28 Senate, in the Journal.
29 12. If, on one or more prior occasions during the current
30 session of the Legislature, a Legislator has made a general
31 disclosure of a conflict of interest on the record in a meeting of a
32 committee or on the floor of the Senate, the Legislator is not
33 required to make that general disclosure at length again regarding
34 the same conflict of interest if, when the matter in question arises
35 on subsequent occasions, the Legislator makes a reference on the
36 record to the previous disclosure.
37 13. In determining whether to abstain from voting upon,
38 advocating or opposing a matter concerning which a Legislator
39 has a conflict of interest pursuant to subsection 10, the Legislator
40 should consider whether:
41 (a) The conflict impedes his or her independence of judgment;
42 and
43 (b) His or her interest is greater than the interests of an entire
44 class of persons similarly situated.
-
*SR1*
– 11 –
1 14. The provisions of this Rule do not under any
2 circumstances and regardless of any conflict of interest:
3 (a) Prohibit a Legislator from requesting or introducing a
4 legislative measure; or
5 (b) Require a Legislator to take any particular action before or
6 while requesting or introducing a legislative measure.
7 15. If a Legislator who is a member of a committee declares
8 on the record when a vote is to be taken by the committee that he
9 or she will abstain from voting because of the requirements of this
10 Rule, the necessary quorum to act upon and the number of votes
11 necessary to act upon the matter is reduced as though the
12 Legislator abstaining were not a member of the committee.
13 16. The standards and procedures set forth in this Rule which
14 govern whether and to what extent a Senator has a conflict of
15 interest, should disclose a conflict of interest or should abstain
16 from voting upon, advocating or opposing a matter concerning
17 which the Senator has a conflict of interest pursuant to
18 subsection 10:
19 (a) Are exclusive and are the only standards and procedures
20 that apply to Senators with regard to such matters; and
21 (b) Supersede and preempt all other standards and procedures
22 with regard to such matters,
23  except that this subsection does not exempt any Senators from
24 the Legislative Code of Ethical Standards in the Joint Standing
25 Rules.
26 17. For purposes of this Rule, “immediate family” means a
27 person who is related to the Legislator by blood, adoption or
28 marriage within the first degree of consanguinity or affinity.
29
30 The next rule is 30.
31
32 IV. QUORUM, VOTING, ELECTIONS
33
34 Rule No. 30. Recorded Vote—Three Required to Call For.
35 1. A recorded vote must be taken upon final passage of a bill
36 or joint resolution, and in any other case when called for by three
37 members. Every Senator within the bar of the Senate shall vote
38 “yea” or “nay” or record himself or herself as “not voting,” unless
39 excused by unanimous vote of the Senate. A Senator who records
40 himself or herself as “not voting” must make a full and complete
41 disclosure of a conflict of interest pursuant to Senate Standing
42 Rule No. 23.
43 2. The votes and names of those absent or recorded as “not
44 voting” and the names of Senators demanding the recorded vote
45 must be entered in the Journal.

1 Rule No. 31. President to Decide—Tie Vote.
2 A question is lost by a tie vote, but when the Senate is equally
3 divided on any question except the passage of a bill or joint
4 resolution, the President may give the deciding vote.
5
6 Rule No. 32. Manner of Election—Voting.

42 Senate following passage by the Assembly and before the bill or
43 resolution is enrolled.
44  In such case, if the Senator is the only sponsor of the bill or

3 3. If a Senator makes a request to have his or her name
4 added or removed as a sponsor of a bill or resolution that was
5 introduced in the Senate, the request must be entered in the
6 Journal.
7 4. If a Senator who is the only sponsor of a bill or resolution
8 that was introduced in the Senate removes his or her name from
9 the bill or resolution while the bill or resolution is in the Senate
10 and no other Senator adds his or her name as the sponsor of the
11 bill or resolution at the time of the request for removal, no further
12 action on the bill or resolution is allowed for that legislative
13 session.
14 5. Notwithstanding any provision of the Standing Rules of the
15 Senate or the Joint Standing Rules of the Senate and Assembly, if
16 all Senators who are primary sponsors or cosponsors of a bill or
17 resolution remove their names as sponsors of the bill or resolution
18 while the bill or resolution is in the Senate and no other Senator
19 adds his or her name as a sponsor of the bill or resolution, the

21 primary joint sponsor or sponsors, if any, must be removed from
22 the bill or resolution without an amendment.

25 immediately following such reading the only questions (except as
26 hereinafter stated) which shall be put by the Chair is, “Shall the
27 bill pass, notwithstanding the objections of the Governor?” It shall
28 not be in order, at any time, to vote upon such vetoed bill without
29 the same having first been read; the merits of the bill itself may be
30 debated and the only motions entertained after the Chair has
31 stated the question are a motion for “The previous question,” or a
32 motion for “No further consideration” of the vetoed bill.
33
34 Rule No. 117. Different Subject Not Admitted as Amendment.

24
25 Rule No. 130. Procedure.
26 1. The Senate shall not dismiss a statement of contest for
27 want of form if any ground of contest is alleged with sufficient
28 certainty to inform the defendant of the charges he or she is
29 required to meet. The following grounds are sufficient, but are not
30 exclusive:
31 (a) That the election board or any member thereof was guilty
32 of malfeasance.
33 (b) That a person who has been declared elected to an office
34 was not at the time of election eligible to that office.
35 (c) That illegal votes were cast and counted for the defendant,
36 which, if taken from the defendant, will reduce the number of
37 legal votes below the number necessary to elect him or her.
38 (d) That the election board, in conducting the election or in
39 canvassing the returns, made errors sufficient to change the result
40 of the election as to any person who has been declared elected.
41 (e) That the defendant has given, or offered to give, to any
42 person a bribe for the purpose of procuring his or her election.
43 (f) That there was a possible malfunction of any voting or
44 counting device.
-
*SR1*
– 31 –
1 2. The contest must be submitted so far as may be possible
2 upon depositions or by written or oral arguments as the Senate
3 may order. Any party to a contest may take the deposition of any
4 witness at any time after the statement of contest is filed with the
5 Secretary of State and before the contest is finally decided. At least
6 5 days’ notice must be given to the prospective deponent and to the
7 other party. If oral statements are made at any hearing before the
8 Senate or a committee thereof which purport to establish matters
9 of fact, they must be made under oath. Strict rules of evidence do
10 not apply.
11 3. The contestant has the burden of proving that any
12 irregularities shown were of such nature as to establish the
13 probability that the result of the election was changed thereby.
14 After consideration of all the evidence, the Senate shall declare
15 the defendant elected unless the Senate finds from the evidence
16 that a person other than the defendant received the greatest
17 number of legal votes, in which case the Senate shall declare that
18 person elected.

32 Rule No. 136. Authorized Use of Remote-Technology Systems
33 in Exceptional Circumstances.
34 1. As used in this Rule, “remote-technology system” means
35 any system or other means of communication that is:
36 (a) Approved by the Majority Leader and uses any electronic,
37 digital or other similar technology to enable a member of the
38 Senate from a remote location to attend, participate, vote and take
39 any other action in any proceedings of the Senate or the
40 Committee of the Whole even though the member is not physically
41 present within the Senate Chambers or at a meeting of the
42 Committee of the Whole.
43 (b) Approved by the chair of a committee, other than the
44 Committee of the Whole, and uses any electronic, digital or other
45 similar technology to enable a member of the Senate from a
-
*SR1*
– 32 –
1 remote location to attend, participate, vote and take any other
2 action in any proceedings of the committee even though the
3 member is not physically present at a meeting of the committee.
4 2. Upon request by a member of the Senate:
5 (a) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, the
6 Majority Leader may authorize the member to use a remote-
7 technology system to attend, participate, vote and take any other
8 action in any proceedings of the Senate or the Committee of the
9 Whole if the Majority Leader determines that exceptional
10 circumstances warrant such use by the member. If the Majority
11 Leader grants such authorization:
12 (1) It must be entered in the Journal of the Senate.
13 (2) A member who uses a remote-technology system to
14 attend or participate in a proceeding of the Senate may not vote on
15 any matter on which a vote is taken in that proceeding unless the
16 member is using the remote-technology system to attend or
17 participate in the proceeding from a location in this State.
18 (b) The chair of a committee, other than the Committee of the
19 Whole, with the approval of the Majority Leader, may authorize
20 the member to use a remote-technology system to attend,
21 participate, vote and take any other action in any proceedings of
22 the committee if the chair and the Majority Leader determine that
23 exceptional circumstances warrant such use by the member. If the
24 chair grants such authorization, it must be entered in the records
25 of the committee.
26 3. Except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (2) of
27 paragraph (a) of subsection 2, if a member of the Senate uses a
28 remote-technology system to attend, participate, vote and take any
29 other action in any proceedings pursuant to this Rule, the member
30 shall be deemed to be present and in attendance at the proceedings
31 for all purposes.
32 4. For the purposes of voting in proceedings of:
33 (a) The Committee of the Whole, the Secretary of the Senate or
34 an authorized assistant shall call the roll of each member who is
35 authorized to use a remote-technology system for the proceedings
36 and, in accordance with the procedures of the Senate, cause the
37 member’s vote to be entered into the record for the purposes of the
38 records of the Committee of the Whole.
39 (b) A committee, other than the Committee of the Whole, the
40 committee secretary shall call the roll of each member who is
41 authorized to use a remote-technology system for the proceedings
42 and, in accordance with the procedures of the committee, cause
43 the member’s vote to be entered into the record for the purposes of
44 the records of the committee.

1 5. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 7 of Senate
2 Standing Rule No. 53, this Rule supersedes, takes precedence and
3 controls over any other rule, provision or principle of law to the
4 extent of any conflict with this Rule.
5 6. The Senate hereby finds and declares that:
6 (a) The Nevada Constitution invests each House of the
7 Legislature with certain plenary and exclusive constitutional
8 powers which may be exercised only by that House and which
9 cannot be usurped, infringed or impaired by the other House or by
10 any other branch of Nevada’s State Government. (Heller v.
11 Legislature, 120 Nev. 456 (2004); Commission on Ethics v. Hardy,
12 125 Nev. 285 (2009); Mason’s Manual of Legislative Procedure §§
13 2-3 & 560-564 (2010) (Mason’s Manual))
14 (b) Section 6 of Article 4 of the Nevada Constitution invests
15 each House with plenary and exclusive constitutional powers to
16 determine the rules of its proceedings and to govern, control and
17 regulate its membership and its internal organization, affairs and
18 management, expressly providing that: “Each House shall judge
19 of the qualifications, elections and returns of its own members,
20 choose its own officers (except the President of the Senate),
21 determine the rules of its proceedings and may punish its members
22 for disorderly conduct, and with the concurrence of two thirds of
23 all the members elected, expel a member.”
24 (c) In addition to its plenary and exclusive constitutional
25 powers, each House possesses certain inherent powers of
26 institutional self-protection and self-preservation to govern,
27 control and regulate its membership and its internal organization,
28 affairs and management. (In re Chapman, 166 U.S. 661, 668
29 (1897); Mason’s Manual § 2; Luther S. Cushing, Elements of the
30 Law & Practice of Legislative Assemblies § 533 (1856) (Cushing’s
31 Legislative Assemblies))
32 (d) The inherent powers of each House are considered “so
33 essential to the authority of a legislative assembly, that it cannot
34 well exist without them; and they are consequently entitled to be
35 regarded as belonging to every such assembly as a necessary
36 incident.” (Cushing’s Legislative Assemblies § 533)
37 (e) The inherent powers of each House authorize it to take all
38 necessary and proper institutional actions that are “recognized by
39 the common parliamentary law.” (Cushing’s Legislative
40 Assemblies § 684)
41 (f) Thus, it is well established that each House is “vested with
42 all the powers and privileges which are necessary and incidental to
43 a free and unobstructed exercise of its appropriate functions.
44 These powers and privileges are derived not from the Constitution;
45 on the contrary, they arise from the very creation of a legislative
-
*SR1*
– 34 –
1 body, and are founded upon the principle of self-preservation.”
2 (Ex parte McCarthy, 29 Cal. 395, 403 (1866))
3 (g) Under the Nevada Constitution, there are no constitutional
4 provisions establishing a particular method for determining
5 whether a member of either House is present at legislative
6 proceedings.
7 (h) The United States Supreme Court has held that when there
8 are no constitutional provisions establishing a particular method
9 for determining whether a member of a legislative house is present
10 at legislative proceedings, “it is therefore within the competency of
11 the house to prescribe any method which shall be reasonably
12 certain to ascertain the fact.” (United States v. Ballin, 144 U.S. 1,
13 6 (1892))
14 (i) The United States Supreme Court has also held that when a
15 legislative house adopts a rule establishing a reasonable method
16 for determining whether a member is present at legislative
17 proceedings, that rule must be given great deference by the courts
18 because:
19 Neither do the advantages or disadvantages, the wisdom or
20 folly, of such a rule present any matters for judicial
21 consideration. With the courts the question is only one of
22 power. The constitution empowers each house to determine
23 its rules of proceedings. It may not by its rules ignore
24 constitutional restraints or violate fundamental rights, and
25 there should be a reasonable relation between the mode or
26 method of proceeding established by the rule and the result
27 which is sought to be attained. But within these limitations
28 all matters of method are open to the determination of the
29 house, and it is no impeachment of the rule to say that some
30 other way would be better, more accurate, or even more just.
31 It is no objection to the validity of a rule that a different one
32 has been prescribed and in force for a length of time. The
33 power to make rules is not one which once exercised is
34 exhausted. It is a continuous power, always subject to be
35 exercised by the house, and, within the limitations
36 suggested, absolute and beyond the challenge of any other
37 body or tribunal.
38
39 (United States v. Ballin, 144 U.S. 1, 5 (1892))
40 7. The Senate hereby exercises its constitutional and inherent
41 powers and privileges and adopts this Rule to:
-
*SR1*
– 35 –
1 (a) Govern, control and regulate its membership and its
2 internal organization, affairs and management;
3 (b) Ensure its institutional self-protection and self-
4 preservation; and
5 (c) Establish a reasonable method for determining whether a
6 member of the Senate is present at legislative proceedings during
7 exceptional circumstances.

22 thirds of all the members elected, expel a member.”
23 (c) In addition to its plenary and exclusive constitutional
24 powers, each House possesses certain inherent powers of
25 institutional self-protection and self-preservation to govern,
26 control and regulate its membership and its internal organization,
27 affairs and management. (In re Chapman, 166 U.S. 661, 668
28 (1897); Mason’s Manual § 2; Luther S. Cushing, Elements of the
29 Law & Practice of Legislative Assemblies § 533 (1856) (Cushing’s
30 Legislative Assemblies))
31 (d) The inherent powers of each House are considered “so
32 essential to the authority of a legislative assembly, that it cannot
33 well exist without them; and they are consequently entitled to be
34 regarded as belonging to every such assembly as a necessary
35 incident.” (Cushing’s Legislative Assemblies § 533)
36 (e) The inherent powers of each House authorize it to take all
37 necessary and proper institutional actions that are “recognized by
38 the common parliamentary law.” (Cushing’s Legislative
39 Assemblies § 684)
40 (f) Thus, it is well established that each House is “vested with
41 all the powers and privileges which are necessary and incidental to
42 a free and unobstructed exercise of its appropriate functions.
43 These powers and privileges are derived not from the Constitution;
44 on the contrary, they arise from the very creation of a legislative

1 body, and are founded upon the principle of self-preservation.”

13 granted, it must be upon the motion, “That he or she be allowed to
14 proceed in order,” and the Senator shall confine himself or herself
15 to the proposal under consideration and avoid personality.
16 2. Every ruling on points of order made by the President is
17 subject to appeal, and a discussion of a question of order may be
18 allowed only upon the appeal of two Senators. In all cases of
19 appeal, the question must be, “Shall the ruling of the Chair stand
20 as the judgment of the Senate?”
21
22 Rule No. 21. Breaches of Decorum.
23 1. In cases of breaches of decorum or propriety, any Senator,

27 language or conduct, the person calling the Senator to order shall
28 report the offensive or indecorous language or conduct to the
29 presiding officer. No member may be held to answer for any
30 language used on the floor of the Senate if business has
31 intervened before exception to the language was taken.
32 3. Indecorous conduct or boisterous or unbecoming language
33 is not permitted in the Senate Chamber.
34
35 Rule No. 22. Portable Electronic Communication Devices.
36 1. A person who is within the Senate Chambers shall not
37 engage in a telephone conversation via the use of a portable
38 telephone when the Senate is convened.
39 2. Before entering the Senate Chambers, any person who

41 an audible alert, such as a ringing or beeping sound, to signal an
42 incoming message or call, shall turn the audible alert off. A device
43 that contains a nonaudible alert, such as a silent vibration, may be

23 qualifications set forth in paragraph (c) of subsection 1. If a
24 member of the Committee is unable to serve for any reason during
25 the consideration of a specific proposal, the alternate appointed
26 with the qualifications from the same paragraph in subsection 1
27 shall serve as a member of the Committee during the
28 consideration of the specific proposal.
29 4. A member of the Committee is disqualified to serve during
30 the consideration of a specific proposal if:
31 (a) The member is the requester of advice concerning the
32 question of ethics or conflict of interest, or the member is the
33 subject of the complaint concerning the specific question; or
34 (b) A reasonable person in the member’s situation could not

36 5. The members of the Committee shall perform any duty

1 (a) May hear requests brought by Senators for advice on
2 specific questions of potential breaches of ethics and conflicts of
3 interest; and
4 (b) Shall hear complaints brought by Senators and others on
5 specific questions of alleged breaches of ethics and conflicts of
6 interest, including, without limitation, alleged breaches of the
7 Legislative Code of Ethical Standards in the Joint Standing Rules.
8 8. All proceedings held by the Committee to consider the
9 character, alleged misconduct, professional competence or
10 physical or mental health of any person on matters of ethics or
11 conflicts of interest and all materials related to those proceedings
12 are confidential, unless the person who is the subject of the
13 proceedings requests a public hearing or discloses the content of
14 the proceedings or materials.
15 9. An individual may file a complaint which alleges a breach
16 of ethics or a conflict of interest, including, without limitation, an
17 alleged breach of the Legislative Code of Ethical Standards in the
18 Joint Standing Rules. If the alleged breach of ethics or conflict of
19 interest involves the conduct of more than one person, separate
20 complaints must be filed regarding each person. A complaint must
21 be:
22 (a) Made in writing on a form provided by the Legislative
23 Counsel;
24 (b) Signed and verified under penalty of perjury by the
25 individual making the allegation; and
26 (c) Filed with the Legislative Counsel who shall review the
27 complaint and any other relevant information and consult with
28 the Chair of the Committee or, if the Chair is the subject of the
29 complaint, with the Vice Chair, to evaluate whether the Committee
30 has jurisdiction and whether an investigation is warranted in the
31 matter. If it is determined that the Committee:
32 (1) Does not have jurisdiction or that an investigation is not
33 warranted in the matter, the Legislative Counsel shall send written
34 notice of the determination to the individual who filed the
35 complaint.
36 (2) Has jurisdiction and an investigation is warranted in
37 the matter, the Legislative Counsel shall send written notice of the
38 determination and a copy of the complaint to the person who is the
39 subject of the complaint.
40 10. Each Legislator is subject, at all times, to the Legislative
41 Code of Ethical Standards in the Joint Standing Rules and, in
42 addition, must determine whether he or she has a conflict of
43 interest upon any matter in question before the Legislator. In
44 determining whether the Legislator has such a conflict of interest,
45 the Legislator should consider whether the independence of
-
*SR1*

– 10 –
1 judgment of a reasonable person in his or her situation upon the
2 matter in question would be materially affected by the
3 Legislator’s:
4 (a) Acceptance of a gift or loan;
5 (b) Private economic interest; or
6 (c) Commitment to a member of his or her household or
7 immediate family.
8  In interpreting and applying the provisions of this subsection, it
9 must be presumed that the independence of judgment of a
10 reasonable person in the Legislator’s situation would not be
11 materially affected by the Legislator’s private economic interest or
12 the Legislator’s commitment to a member of his or her household
13 or immediate family where the resulting benefit or detriment
14 accruing to the Legislator, or if the Legislator has a commitment
15 to a member of his or her household or immediate family,
16 accruing to those other persons, is not greater than that accruing
17 to any other member of the general business, profession,
18 occupation or group that is affected by the matter.
19 11. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 12, if a
20 Legislator knows he or she has a conflict of interest pursuant to
21 subsection 10, the Legislator shall make a disclosure of the
22 conflict of interest on the record in a meeting of a committee or on
23 the floor of the Senate, as applicable. Such a disclosure must be
24 entered:
25 (a) If the Legislator makes the disclosure in a meeting of a
26 committee, in the minutes for that meeting.
27 (b) If the Legislator makes the disclosure on the floor of the
28 Senate, in the Journal.
29 12. If, on one or more prior occasions during the current
30 session of the Legislature, a Legislator has made a general
31 disclosure of a conflict of interest on the record in a meeting of a
32 committee or on the floor of the Senate, the Legislator is not
33 required to make that general disclosure at length again regarding
34 the same conflict of interest if, when the matter in question arises
35 on subsequent occasions, the Legislator makes a reference on the
36 record to the previous disclosure.
37 13. In determining whether to abstain from voting upon,
38 advocating or opposing a matter concerning which a Legislator
39 has a conflict of interest pursuant to subsection 10, the Legislator
40 should consider whether:
41 (a) The conflict impedes his or her independence of judgment;
42 and
43 (b) His or her interest is greater than the interests of an entire
44 class of persons similarly situated.
-
*SR1*

– 11 –
1 14. The provisions of this Rule do not under any
2 circumstances and regardless of any conflict of interest:
3 (a) Prohibit a Legislator from requesting or introducing a
4 legislative measure; or
5 (b) Require a Legislator to take any particular action before or
6 while requesting or introducing a legislative measure.
7 15. If a Legislator who is a member of a committee declares
8 on the record when a vote is to be taken by the committee that he
9 or she will abstain from voting because of the requirements of this
10 Rule, the necessary quorum to act upon and the number of votes
11 necessary to act upon the matter is reduced as though the
12 Legislator abstaining were not a member of the committee.
13 16. The standards and procedures set forth in this Rule which
14 govern whether and to what extent a Senator has a conflict of
15 interest, should disclose a conflict of interest or should abstain
16 from voting upon, advocating or opposing a matter concerning
17 which the Senator has a conflict of interest pursuant to
18 subsection 10:
19 (a) Are exclusive and are the only standards and procedures
20 that apply to Senators with regard to such matters; and
21 (b) Supersede and preempt all other standards and procedures
22 with regard to such matters,
23  except that this subsection does not exempt any Senators from
24 the Legislative Code of Ethical Standards in the Joint Standing
25 Rules.
26 17. For purposes of this Rule, “immediate family” means a
27 person who is related to the Legislator by blood, adoption or
28 marriage within the first degree of consanguinity or affinity.

36 or joint resolution, and in any other case when called for by three
37 members. Every Senator within the bar of the Senate shall vote
38 “yea” or “nay” or record himself or herself as “not voting,” unless
39 excused by unanimous vote of the Senate. A Senator who records
40 himself or herself as “not voting” must make a full and complete
41 disclosure of a conflict of interest pursuant to Senate Standing
42 Rule No. 23.
43 2. The votes and names of those absent or recorded as “not

23 D. CONTESTS OF ELECTIONS
24
25 Rule No. 130. Procedure.
26 1. The Senate shall not dismiss a statement of contest for
27 want of form if any ground of contest is alleged with sufficient
28 certainty to inform the defendant of the charges he or she is
29 required to meet. The following grounds are sufficient, but are not
30 exclusive:
31 (a) That the election board or any member thereof was guilty
32 of malfeasance.
33 (b) That a person who has been declared elected to an office
34 was not at the time of election eligible to that office.
35 (c) That illegal votes were cast and counted for the defendant,
36 which, if taken from the defendant, will reduce the number of
37 legal votes below the number necessary to elect him or her.
38 (d) That the election board, in conducting the election or in
39 canvassing the returns, made errors sufficient to change the result
40 of the election as to any person who has been declared elected.
41 (e) That the defendant has given, or offered to give, to any
42 person a bribe for the purpose of procuring his or her election.
43 (f) That there was a possible malfunction of any voting or
44 counting device.

*SR1*

– 31 –
1 2. The contest must be submitted so far as may be possible
2 upon depositions or by written or oral arguments as the Senate
3 may order. Any party to a contest may take the deposition of any
4 witness at any time after the statement of contest is filed with the
5 Secretary of State and before the contest is finally decided. At least
6 5 days’ notice must be given to the prospective deponent and to the
7 other party. If oral statements are made at any hearing before the
8 Senate or a committee thereof which purport to establish matters
9 of fact, they must be made under oath. Strict rules of evidence do
10 not apply.
11 3. The contestant has the burden of proving that any
12 irregularities shown were of such nature as to establish the
13 probability that the result of the election was changed thereby.
14 After consideration of all the evidence, the Senate shall declare
15 the defendant elected unless the Senate finds from the evidence
16 that a person other than the defendant received the greatest
17 number of legal votes, in which case the Senate shall declare that
18 person elected.

32 Rule No. 136. Authorized Use of Remote-Technology Systems
33 in Exceptional Circumstances.
34 1. As used in this Rule, “remote-technology system” means
35 any system or other means of communication that is:
36 (a) Approved by the Majority Leader and uses any electronic,
37 digital or other similar technology to enable a member of the
38 Senate from a remote location to attend, participate, vote and take
39 any other action in any proceedings of the Senate or the
40 Committee of the Whole even though the member is not physically
41 present within the Senate Chambers or at a meeting of the
42 Committee of the Whole.
43 (b) Approved by the chair of a committee, other than the
44 Committee of the Whole, and uses any electronic, digital or other
45 similar technology to enable a member of the Senate from a
-
*SR1*

– 32 –
1 remote location to attend, participate, vote and take any other
2 action in any proceedings of the committee even though the
3 member is not physically present at a meeting of the committee.
4 2. Upon request by a member of the Senate:
5 (a) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, the
6 Majority Leader may authorize the member to use a remote-
7 technology system to attend, participate, vote and take any other
8 action in any proceedings of the Senate or the Committee of the
9 Whole if the Majority Leader determines that exceptional
10 circumstances warrant such use by the member. If the Majority
11 Leader grants such authorization:
12 (1) It must be entered in the Journal of the Senate.
13 (2) A member who uses a remote-technology system to
14 attend or participate in a proceeding of the Senate may not vote on
15 any matter on which a vote is taken in that proceeding unless the
16 member is using the remote-technology system to attend or
17 participate in the proceeding from a location in this State.
18 (b) The chair of a committee, other than the Committee of the
19 Whole, with the approval of the Majority Leader, may authorize
20 the member to use a remote-technology system to attend,
21 participate, vote and take any other action in any proceedings of
22 the committee if the chair and the Majority Leader determine that
23 exceptional circumstances warrant such use by the member. If the
24 chair grants such authorization, it must be entered in the records
25 of the committee.
26 3. Except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (2) of
27 paragraph (a) of subsection 2, if a member of the Senate uses a
28 remote-technology system to attend, participate, vote and take any
29 other action in any proceedings pursuant to this Rule, the member
30 shall be deemed to be present and in attendance at the proceedings
31 for all purposes.
32 4. For the purposes of voting in proceedings of:
33 (a) The Committee of the Whole, the Secretary of the Senate or
34 an authorized assistant shall call the roll of each member who is
35 authorized to use a remote-technology system for the proceedings
36 and, in accordance with the procedures of the Senate, cause the
37 member’s vote to be entered into the record for the purposes of the
38 records of the Committee of the Whole.
39 (b) A committee, other than the Committee of the Whole, the
40 committee secretary shall call the roll of each member who is
41 authorized to use a remote-technology system for the proceedings
42 and, in accordance with the procedures of the committee, cause
43 the member’s vote to be entered into the record for the purposes of
44 the records of the committee.

1 5. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 7 of Senate
2 Standing Rule No. 53, this Rule supersedes, takes precedence and
3 controls over any other rule, provision or principle of law to the
4 extent of any conflict with this Rule.
5 6. The Senate hereby finds and declares that:
6 (a) The Nevada Constitution invests each House of the
7 Legislature with certain plenary and exclusive constitutional
8 powers which may be exercised only by that House and which
9 cannot be usurped, infringed or impaired by the other House or by
10 any other branch of Nevada’s State Government. (Heller v.
11 Legislature, 120 Nev. 456 (2004); Commission on Ethics v. Hardy,
12 125 Nev. 285 (2009); Mason’s Manual of Legislative Procedure §§
13 2-3 & 560-564 (2010) (Mason’s Manual))
14 (b) Section 6 of Article 4 of the Nevada Constitution invests
15 each House with plenary and exclusive constitutional powers to
16 determine the rules of its proceedings and to govern, control and
17 regulate its membership and its internal organization, affairs and
18 management, expressly providing that: “Each House shall judge
19 of the qualifications, elections and returns of its own members,
20 choose its own officers (except the President of the Senate),
21 determine the rules of its proceedings and may punish its members
22 for disorderly conduct, and with the concurrence of two thirds of
23 all the members elected, expel a member.”
24 (c) In addition to its plenary and exclusive constitutional
25 powers, each House possesses certain inherent powers of
26 institutional self-protection and self-preservation to govern,
27 control and regulate its membership and its internal organization,
28 affairs and management. (In re Chapman, 166 U.S. 661, 668
29 (1897); Mason’s Manual § 2; Luther S. Cushing, Elements of the
30 Law & Practice of Legislative Assemblies § 533 (1856) (Cushing’s
31 Legislative Assemblies))
32 (d) The inherent powers of each House are considered “so
33 essential to the authority of a legislative assembly, that it cannot
34 well exist without them; and they are consequently entitled to be
35 regarded as belonging to every such assembly as a necessary
36 incident.” (Cushing’s Legislative Assemblies § 533)
37 (e) The inherent powers of each House authorize it to take all
38 necessary and proper institutional actions that are “recognized by
39 the common parliamentary law.” (Cushing’s Legislative
40 Assemblies § 684)
41 (f) Thus, it is well established that each House is “vested with
42 all the powers and privileges which are necessary and incidental to
43 a free and unobstructed exercise of its appropriate functions.
44 These powers and privileges are derived not from the Constitution;
45 on the contrary, they arise from the very creation of a legislative
-
*SR1*

– 34 –
1 body, and are founded upon the principle of self-preservation.”
2 (Ex parte McCarthy, 29 Cal. 395, 403 (1866))
3 (g) Under the Nevada Constitution, there are no constitutional
4 provisions establishing a particular method for determining
5 whether a member of either House is present at legislative
6 proceedings.
7 (h) The United States Supreme Court has held that when there
8 are no constitutional provisions establishing a particular method
9 for determining whether a member of a legislative house is present
10 at legislative proceedings, “it is therefore within the competency of
11 the house to prescribe any method which shall be reasonably
12 certain to ascertain the fact.” (United States v. Ballin, 144 U.S. 1,
13 6 (1892))
14 (i) The United States Supreme Court has also held that when a
15 legislative house adopts a rule establishing a reasonable method
16 for determining whether a member is present at legislative
17 proceedings, that rule must be given great deference by the courts
18 because:
19 Neither do the advantages or disadvantages, the wisdom or
20 folly, of such a rule present any matters for judicial
21 consideration. With the courts the question is only one of
22 power. The constitution empowers each house to determine
23 its rules of proceedings. It may not by its rules ignore
24 constitutional restraints or violate fundamental rights, and
25 there should be a reasonable relation between the mode or
26 method of proceeding established by the rule and the result
27 which is sought to be attained. But within these limitations
28 all matters of method are open to the determination of the
29 house, and it is no impeachment of the rule to say that some
30 other way would be better, more accurate, or even more just.
31 It is no objection to the validity of a rule that a different one
32 has been prescribed and in force for a length of time. The
33 power to make rules is not one which once exercised is
34 exhausted. It is a continuous power, always subject to be
35 exercised by the house, and, within the limitations
36 suggested, absolute and beyond the challenge of any other
37 body or tribunal.
38
39 (United States v. Ballin, 144 U.S. 1, 5 (1892))
40 7. The Senate hereby exercises its constitutional and inherent
41 powers and privileges and adopts this Rule to:
-
*SR1*

– 35 –
1 (a) Govern, control and regulate its membership and its
2 internal organization, affairs and management;
3 (b) Ensure its institutional self-protection and self-
4 preservation; and
5 (c) Establish a reasonable method for determining whether a
6 member of the Senate is present at legislative proceedings during
7 exceptional circumstances.
8
9 The next rule is 140.

11 IX. LEGISLATIVE INVESTIGATIONS
12
13 Rule No. 140. Compensation of Witnesses.
14 Witnesses summoned to appear before the Senate, or any of its
15 committees, shall be compensated as provided by law for witnesses
16 required to attend in the courts of the State of Nevada.
17
18 And be it further
19 RESOLVED, That this resolution becomes effective upon
20 adoption.
