matter that is solely and exclusively within the constitutional or
inherent powers of the Senate, including, without limitation, any
matter that may be considered and acted on by the Senate
pursuant to its plenary and exclusive constitutional powers under
Article 4, Section 6 of the Nevada Constitution or pursuant to its
inherent powers of institutional self-protection and self-
preservation to govern, control and regulate its membership and
its internal organization, affairs and management.

Section 23:

majority of the members elected to the Senate, the Secretary shall
notify all members of the Senate that the Senate will be convened
pursuant to this Rule and the date on which the Senate will be

Section 24:
3. The Senate hereby finds and declares that:
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 6 –
(a) The Nevada Constitution invests each House of the
Legislature with certain plenary and exclusive constitutional
powers which may be exercised only by that House and which
cannot be usurped, infringed or impaired by the other House or by
any other branch of Nevada’s State Government. (Heller v.
Legislature, 120 Nev. 456 (2004); Commission on Ethics v. Hardy,
125 Nev. 285 (2009); Mason’s Manual of Legislative Procedure §§
2-3 & 560-564 (2010) (Mason’s Manual))
(b) Article 4, Section 6 of the Nevada Constitution invests each
House with plenary and exclusive constitutional powers to govern,
control and regulate its membership and its internal organization,
affairs and management, expressly providing that: “Each House
shall judge of the qualifications, elections and returns of its own
members, choose its own officers (except the President of the
Senate), determine the rules of its proceedings and may punish its
members for disorderly conduct, and with the concurrence of two
thirds of all the members elected, expel a member.”
(c) In addition to its plenary and exclusive constitutional
powers, each House possesses certain inherent powers of
institutional self-protection and self-preservation to govern,
control and regulate its membership and its internal organization,
affairs and management. (In re Chapman, 166 U.S. 661, 668
(1897); Mason’s Manual § 2; Luther S. Cushing, Elements of the
Law & Practice of Legislative Assemblies § 533 (1856) (Cushing’s
Legislative Assemblies))
(d) The inherent powers of each House are considered “so
essential to the authority of a legislative assembly, that it cannot
well exist without them; and they are consequently entitled to be
regarded as belonging to every such assembly as a necessary
incident.” (Cushing’s Legislative Assemblies § 533)
(e) The inherent powers of each House authorize it to take all
necessary and proper institutional actions that are “recognized by
the common parliamentary law.” (Cushing’s Legislative
Assemblies § 684)
(f) Thus, it is well established that each House is “vested with
all the powers and privileges which are necessary and incidental to
a free and unobstructed exercise of its appropriate functions.
These powers and privileges are derived not from the Constitution;
on the contrary, they arise from the very creation of a legislative
body, and are founded upon the principle of self-preservation.”
(Ex parte McCarthy, 29 Cal. 395, 403 (1866))

granted, it must be upon the motion, “That he or she be allowed to
proceed in order,” and the Senator shall confine himself or herself
to the proposal under consideration and avoid personality.

Section 26:
2. Every ruling on points of order made by the President is
subject to appeal, and a discussion of a question of order may be
allowed only upon the appeal of two Senators. In all cases of

as the judgment of the Senate?”

1. In cases of breaches of decorum or propriety, any Senator,
officer or other person is liable to such censure or punishment as

language or conduct, the person calling the Senator to order shall

language used on the floor of the Senate if business has
intervened before exception to the language was taken.

Section 29:
3. Indecorous conduct or boisterous or unbecoming language
is not permitted in the Senate Chamber.

Section 31:
2. Before entering the Senate Chambers, any person who
possesses a portable electronic communication device that emits
an audible alert, such as a ringing or beeping sound, to signal an

with the qualifications from the same paragraph in subsection 1
shall serve as a member of the Committee during the
consideration of the specific proposal.

Section 35:
4. A member of the Committee is disqualified to serve during

exercise independent judgment on the matter in question.

Section 36:

specific questions of potential breaches of ethics and conflicts of

Legislative Code of Ethical Standards in the Joint Standing Rules.

Section 39:
8. All proceedings held by the Committee to consider the
character, alleged misconduct, professional competence or
physical or mental health of any person on matters of ethics or
conflicts of interest and all materials related to those proceedings
are confidential, unless the person who is the subject of the

the proceedings or materials.

Section 40:
9. An individual may file a complaint which alleges a breach
of ethics or a conflict of interest, including, without limitation, an
alleged breach of the Legislative Code of Ethical Standards in the
Joint Standing Rules. If the alleged breach of ethics or conflict of
interest involves the conduct of more than one person, separate
complaints must be filed regarding each person. A complaint must
be:
(a) Made in writing on a form provided by the Legislative
Counsel;
(b) Signed and verified under penalty of perjury by the
individual making the allegation; and
(c) Filed with the Legislative Counsel who shall review the
complaint and any other relevant information and consult with
the Chair of the Committee or, if the Chair is the subject of the
complaint, with the Vice Chair, to evaluate whether the Committee
has jurisdiction and whether an investigation is warranted in the
matter. If it is determined that the Committee:
(1) Does not have jurisdiction or that an investigation is not
warranted in the matter, the Legislative Counsel shall send written
notice of the determination to the individual who filed the
complaint.
(2) Has jurisdiction and an investigation is warranted in
the matter, the Legislative Counsel shall send written notice of the
determination and a copy of the complaint to the person who is the

Section 41:
10. Each Legislator is subject, at all times, to the Legislative
Code of Ethical Standards in the Joint Standing Rules and, in
addition, must determine whether he or she has a conflict of
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 10 –
interest upon any matter in question before the Legislator. In
determining whether the Legislator has such a conflict of interest,
the Legislator should consider whether the independence of
judgment of a reasonable person in his or her situation upon the
matter in question would be materially affected by the
Legislator’s:
(a) Acceptance of a gift or loan;
(b) Private economic interest; or
(c) Commitment to a member of his or her household or
immediate family.
 In interpreting and applying the provisions of this subsection, it
must be presumed that the independence of judgment of a
reasonable person in the Legislator’s situation would not be
materially affected by the Legislator’s private economic interest or
the Legislator’s commitment to a member of his or her household
or immediate family where the resulting benefit or detriment
accruing to the Legislator, or if the Legislator has a commitment
to a member of his or her household or immediate family,
accruing to those other persons, is not greater than that accruing
to any other member of the general business, profession,
occupation or group that is affected by the matter.

Section 42:
11. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 12, if a
Legislator knows he or she has a conflict of interest pursuant to
subsection 10, the Legislator shall make a disclosure of the
conflict of interest on the record in a meeting of a committee or on
the floor of the Senate, as applicable. Such a disclosure must be
entered:
(a) If the Legislator makes the disclosure in a meeting of a
committee, in the minutes for that meeting.
(b) If the Legislator makes the disclosure on the floor of the
Senate, in the Journal.

Section 43:
12. If, on one or more prior occasions during the current
session of the Legislature, a Legislator has made a general
disclosure of a conflict of interest on the record in a meeting of a
committee or on the floor of the Senate, the Legislator is not
required to make that general disclosure at length again regarding
the same conflict of interest if, when the matter in question arises
on subsequent occasions, the Legislator makes a reference on the
record to the previous disclosure.

Section 44:
13. In determining whether to abstain from voting upon,
advocating or opposing a matter concerning which a Legislator
has a conflict of interest pursuant to subsection 10, the Legislator
should consider whether:
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 11 –
(a) The conflict impedes his or her independence of judgment;
and
(b) His or her interest is greater than the interests of an entire
class of persons similarly situated.

Section 45:
14. The provisions of this Rule do not under any
circumstances and regardless of any conflict of interest:
(a) Prohibit a Legislator from requesting or introducing a
legislative measure; or
(b) Require a Legislator to take any particular action before or
while requesting or introducing a legislative measure.

Section 46:
15. If a Legislator who is a member of a committee declares
on the record when a vote is to be taken by the committee that he
or she will abstain from voting because of the requirements of this
Rule, the necessary quorum to act upon and the number of votes
necessary to act upon the matter is reduced as though the
Legislator abstaining were not a member of the committee.

Section 47:
16. The standards and procedures set forth in this Rule which
govern whether and to what extent a Senator has a conflict of
interest, should disclose a conflict of interest or should abstain
from voting upon, advocating or opposing a matter concerning
which the Senator has a conflict of interest pursuant to
subsection 10:
(a) Are exclusive and are the only standards and procedures
that apply to Senators with regard to such matters; and
(b) Supersede and preempt all other standards and procedures
with regard to such matters,
 except that this subsection does not exempt any Senators from
the Legislative Code of Ethical Standards in the Joint Standing
Rules.

Section 48:
17. For purposes of this Rule, “immediate family” means a
person who is related to the Legislator by blood, adoption or
marriage within the first degree of consanguinity or affinity.
The next rule is 30.
IV. QUORUM, VOTING, ELECTIONS
Rule No. 30. Recorded Vote—Three Required to Call For.

Section 49:
1. A recorded vote must be taken upon final passage of a bill
or joint resolution, and in any other case when called for by three
members. Every Senator within the bar of the Senate shall vote
“yea” or “nay” or record himself or herself as “not voting,” unless
excused by unanimous vote of the Senate. A Senator who records
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 12 –
himself or herself as “not voting” must make a full and complete
disclosure of a conflict of interest pursuant to Senate Standing
Rule No. 23.

Section 50:
2. The votes and names of those absent or recorded as “not
voting” and the names of Senators demanding the recorded vote
must be entered in the Journal.

resolution, the President may give the deciding vote.
Rule No. 32. Manner of Election—Voting.

Section 51:
1. In all cases of election by the Senate, the vote must be

(a) Vote except when at his or her seat, unless authorized to
use a remote-technology system to vote pursuant to Senate
Standing Rule No. 136;
(b) Explain his or her vote or discuss the question while the
voting is in progress; or
(c) Change his or her vote after the result is announced.

Section 158:
1. The Senate shall not dismiss a statement of contest for
want of form if any ground of contest is alleged with sufficient
certainty to inform the defendant of the charges he or she is
required to meet. The following grounds are sufficient, but are not
exclusive:
(a) That the election board or any member thereof was guilty
of malfeasance.
(b) That a person who has been declared elected to an office
was not at the time of election eligible to that office.
(c) That illegal votes were cast and counted for the defendant,
which, if taken from the defendant, will reduce the number of
legal votes below the number necessary to elect him or her.
(d) That the election board, in conducting the election or in
canvassing the returns, made errors sufficient to change the result
of the election as to any person who has been declared elected.
(e) That the defendant has given, or offered to give, to any
person a bribe for the purpose of procuring his or her election.
(f) That there was a possible malfunction of any voting or
counting device.

Section 159:
2. The contest must be submitted so far as may be possible
upon depositions or by written or oral arguments as the Senate
-
83rd Session (2025)

may order. Any party to a contest may take the deposition of any
witness at any time after the statement of contest is filed with the
Secretary of State and before the contest is finally decided. At least
5 days’ notice must be given to the prospective deponent and to the
other party. If oral statements are made at any hearing before the
Senate or a committee thereof which purport to establish matters
of fact, they must be made under oath. Strict rules of evidence do
not apply.

Section 160:
3. The contestant has the burden of proving that any
irregularities shown were of such nature as to establish the
probability that the result of the election was changed thereby.
After consideration of all the evidence, the Senate shall declare
the defendant elected unless the Senate finds from the evidence
that a person other than the defendant received the greatest
number of legal votes, in which case the Senate shall declare that
person elected.
E. REMOTE-TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS

Rule No. 133. Reserved.
Rule No. 134. Reserved.
Rule No. 135. Reserved.
Rule No. 136. Authorized Use of Remote-Technology Systems
in Exceptional Circumstances.

Section 161:
1. As used in this Rule, “remote-technology system” means
any system or other means of communication that is:
(a) Approved by the Majority Leader and uses any electronic,
digital or other similar technology to enable a member of the
Senate from a remote location to attend, participate, vote and take
any other action in any proceedings of the Senate or the
Committee of the Whole even though the member is not physically
present within the Senate Chambers or at a meeting of the
Committee of the Whole.
(b) Approved by the chair of a committee, other than the
Committee of the Whole, and uses any electronic, digital or other
similar technology to enable a member of the Senate from a
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 33 –
remote location to attend, participate, vote and take any other
action in any proceedings of the committee even though the
member is not physically present at a meeting of the committee.

Section 162:
2. Upon request by a member of the Senate:
(a) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, the
Majority Leader may authorize the member to use a remote-
technology system to attend, participate, vote and take any other
action in any proceedings of the Senate or the Committee of the
Whole if the Majority Leader determines that exceptional
circumstances warrant such use by the member. If the Majority
Leader grants such authorization:
(1) It must be entered in the Journal of the Senate.
(2) A member who uses a remote-technology system to
attend or participate in a proceeding of the Senate may not vote on
any matter on which a vote is taken in that proceeding unless the
member is using the remote-technology system to attend or
participate in the proceeding from a location in this State.
(b) The chair of a committee, other than the Committee of the
Whole, with the approval of the Majority Leader, may authorize
the member to use a remote-technology system to attend,
participate, vote and take any other action in any proceedings of
the committee if the chair and the Majority Leader determine that
exceptional circumstances warrant such use by the member. If the
chair grants such authorization, it must be entered in the records
of the committee.

Section 163:
3. Except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (2) of
paragraph (a) of subsection 2, if a member of the Senate uses a
remote-technology system to attend, participate, vote and take any
other action in any proceedings pursuant to this Rule, the member
shall be deemed to be present and in attendance at the proceedings
for all purposes.

Section 164:
4. For the purposes of voting in proceedings of:
(a) The Committee of the Whole, the Secretary of the Senate or
an authorized assistant shall call the roll of each member who is
authorized to use a remote-technology system for the proceedings
and, in accordance with the procedures of the Senate, cause the
member’s vote to be entered into the record for the purposes of the
records of the Committee of the Whole.
(b) A committee, other than the Committee of the Whole, the
committee secretary shall call the roll of each member who is
authorized to use a remote-technology system for the proceedings
and, in accordance with the procedures of the committee, cause
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 34 –
the member’s vote to be entered into the record for the purposes of
the records of the committee.

Section 165:
5. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 7 of Senate
Standing Rule No. 53, this Rule supersedes, takes precedence and
controls over any other rule, provision or principle of law to the
extent of any conflict with this Rule.

Section 166:
6. The Senate hereby finds and declares that:
(a) The Nevada Constitution invests each House of the
Legislature with certain plenary and exclusive constitutional
powers which may be exercised only by that House and which
cannot be usurped, infringed or impaired by the other House or by
any other branch of Nevada’s State Government. (Heller v.
Legislature, 120 Nev. 456 (2004); Commission on Ethics v. Hardy,
125 Nev. 285 (2009); Mason’s Manual of Legislative Procedure §§
2-3 & 560-564 (2010) (Mason’s Manual))
(b) Section 6 of Article 4 of the Nevada Constitution invests
each House with plenary and exclusive constitutional powers to
determine the rules of its proceedings and to govern, control and
regulate its membership and its internal organization, affairs and
management, expressly providing that: “Each House shall judge
of the qualifications, elections and returns of its own members,
choose its own officers (except the President of the Senate),
determine the rules of its proceedings and may punish its members
for disorderly conduct, and with the concurrence of two thirds of
all the members elected, expel a member.”
(c) In addition to its plenary and exclusive constitutional
powers, each House possesses certain inherent powers of
institutional self-protection and self-preservation to govern,
control and regulate its membership and its internal organization,
affairs and management. (In re Chapman, 166 U.S. 661, 668
(1897); Mason’s Manual § 2; Luther S. Cushing, Elements of the
Law & Practice of Legislative Assemblies § 533 (1856) (Cushing’s
Legislative Assemblies))
(d) The inherent powers of each House are considered “so
essential to the authority of a legislative assembly, that it cannot
well exist without them; and they are consequently entitled to be
regarded as belonging to every such assembly as a necessary
incident.” (Cushing’s Legislative Assemblies § 533)
(e) The inherent powers of each House authorize it to take all
necessary and proper institutional actions that are “recognized by
the common parliamentary law.” (Cushing’s Legislative
Assemblies § 684)
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 35 –
(f) Thus, it is well established that each House is “vested with
all the powers and privileges which are necessary and incidental to
a free and unobstructed exercise of its appropriate functions.
These powers and privileges are derived not from the Constitution;
on the contrary, they arise from the very creation of a legislative
body, and are founded upon the principle of self-preservation.”
(Ex parte McCarthy, 29 Cal. 395, 403 (1866))
(g) Under the Nevada Constitution, there are no constitutional
provisions establishing a particular method for determining
whether a member of either House is present at legislative
proceedings.
(h) The United States Supreme Court has held that when there
are no constitutional provisions establishing a particular method
for determining whether a member of a legislative house is present
at legislative proceedings, “it is therefore within the competency of
the house to prescribe any method which shall be reasonably
certain to ascertain the fact.” (United States v. Ballin, 144 U.S. 1,
6 (1892))
(i) The United States Supreme Court has also held that when a
legislative house adopts a rule establishing a reasonable method
for determining whether a member is present at legislative
proceedings, that rule must be given great deference by the courts
because:
Neither do the advantages or disadvantages, the wisdom or
folly, of such a rule present any matters for judicial
consideration. With the courts the question is only one of
power. The constitution empowers each house to determine
its rules of proceedings. It may not by its rules ignore
constitutional restraints or violate fundamental rights, and
there should be a reasonable relation between the mode or
method of proceeding established by the rule and the result
which is sought to be attained. But within these limitations
all matters of method are open to the determination of the
house, and it is no impeachment of the rule to say that some
other way would be better, more accurate, or even more just.
It is no objection to the validity of a rule that a different one
has been prescribed and in force for a length of time. The
power to make rules is not one which once exercised is
exhausted. It is a continuous power, always subject to be
exercised by the house, and, within the limitations
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 36 –
suggested, absolute and beyond the challenge of any other
body or tribunal.
(United States v. Ballin, 144 U.S. 1, 5 (1892))

Section 167:
7. The Senate hereby exercises its constitutional and inherent
powers and privileges and adopts this Rule to:
(a) Govern, control and regulate its membership and its
internal organization, affairs and management;
(b) Ensure its institutional self-protection and self-
preservation; and
(c) Establish a reasonable method for determining whether a
member of the Senate is present at legislative proceedings during
exceptional circumstances.
The next rule is 140.
IX. LEGISLATIVE INVESTIGATIONS
Rule No. 140. Compensation of Witnesses.
Witnesses summoned to appear before the Senate, or any of its
committees, shall be compensated as provided by law for witnesses
required to attend in the courts of the State of Nevada.
And be it further
RESOLVED, That this resolution becomes effective upon
adoption.

any disturbance or disorderly conduct within the Senate Chamber,
shall order the Sergeant at Arms to suppress it, and may order the
arrest of any person creating any disturbance within the Senate
Chamber. The President may speak to points of order in
preference to members, rising from the President’s seat for that
purpose, and shall decide questions of order without debate,
subject to an appeal to the Senate by two members, on which
appeal no member may speak more than once without leave of the
Senate. The President shall sign all acts, addresses and joint
resolutions, and all writs, warrants and subpoenas issued by order

– 3 –
Senate and certify as to the passage of bills and resolutions; and in

limitation, matters referred to the committees of the Senate.
6. When preparing publications, signage, nameplates or other

reporting findings to the next session of the Legislature.

A Call of the Senate may be moved by three Senators, and if
carried by a majority of all present, the Secretary shall call the roll
and note the absentees, after which the names of the absentees

-
83rd Session (2025)

– 5 –
Sergeant at Arms directed to take into custody all who may be
absent without leave, and all Senators so taken into custody shall
be presented at the bar of the Senate for such action as to the
Senate may seem proper.
Rule No. 12. Absence—Leave Required.
No Senator shall absent himself or herself from the service of
the Senate without leave, except in case of accident or sickness,
and if any Senator or officer shall so absent himself or herself, the
per diem of the Senator shall not be allowed to him or her.
Rule No. 13. Open Meetings.
1. Except as provided in the Constitution of the State of
Nevada and in subsection 2, all meetings of the Senate and its
committees must be open to the public.
2. A Senate committee meeting may be closed to consider the
character, alleged misconduct, professional competence, or
physical or mental health of a person.
Rule No. 14. Convening of Senate between Legislative
Sessions.
1. The Senate may be convened at any time between sessions
of the Legislature upon a petition signed by a majority of the
members elected to the Senate to consider and take action on any
matter that is solely and exclusively within the constitutional or
inherent powers of the Senate, including, without limitation, any
matter that may be considered and acted on by the Senate
pursuant to its plenary and exclusive constitutional powers under
Article 4, Section 6 of the Nevada Constitution or pursuant to its
inherent powers of institutional self-protection and self-
preservation to govern, control and regulate its membership and
its internal organization, affairs and management.
2. A petition convening the Senate pursuant to this Rule must
specify the matter that will be considered or acted on by the
Senate, indicate a date for the Senate to convene and be
transmitted to the Secretary of the Senate. Upon receipt of one or
more substantially similar petitions signed, in the aggregate, by a
majority of the members elected to the Senate, the Secretary shall
notify all members of the Senate that the Senate will be convened
pursuant to this Rule and the date on which the Senate will be
convened.
3. The Senate hereby finds and declares that:
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 6 –
(a) The Nevada Constitution invests each House of the
Legislature with certain plenary and exclusive constitutional
powers which may be exercised only by that House and which
cannot be usurped, infringed or impaired by the other House or by
any other branch of Nevada’s State Government. (Heller v.
Legislature, 120 Nev. 456 (2004); Commission on Ethics v. Hardy,
125 Nev. 285 (2009); Mason’s Manual of Legislative Procedure §§
2-3 & 560-564 (2010) (Mason’s Manual))
(b) Article 4, Section 6 of the Nevada Constitution invests each
House with plenary and exclusive constitutional powers to govern,
control and regulate its membership and its internal organization,
affairs and management, expressly providing that: “Each House
shall judge of the qualifications, elections and returns of its own
members, choose its own officers (except the President of the
Senate), determine the rules of its proceedings and may punish its
members for disorderly conduct, and with the concurrence of two
thirds of all the members elected, expel a member.”
(c) In addition to its plenary and exclusive constitutional
powers, each House possesses certain inherent powers of
institutional self-protection and self-preservation to govern,
control and regulate its membership and its internal organization,
affairs and management. (In re Chapman, 166 U.S. 661, 668
(1897); Mason’s Manual § 2; Luther S. Cushing, Elements of the
Law & Practice of Legislative Assemblies § 533 (1856) (Cushing’s
Legislative Assemblies))
(d) The inherent powers of each House are considered “so
essential to the authority of a legislative assembly, that it cannot
well exist without them; and they are consequently entitled to be
regarded as belonging to every such assembly as a necessary
incident.” (Cushing’s Legislative Assemblies § 533)
(e) The inherent powers of each House authorize it to take all
necessary and proper institutional actions that are “recognized by
the common parliamentary law.” (Cushing’s Legislative
Assemblies § 684)
(f) Thus, it is well established that each House is “vested with
all the powers and privileges which are necessary and incidental to
a free and unobstructed exercise of its appropriate functions.
These powers and privileges are derived not from the Constitution;
on the contrary, they arise from the very creation of a legislative
body, and are founded upon the principle of self-preservation.”
(Ex parte McCarthy, 29 Cal. 395, 403 (1866))
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 7 –
The next rule is 20.
III. DECORUM AND DEBATE
Rule No. 20. Points of Order.
1. If any Senator, in speaking or otherwise, transgresses the
rules of the Senate, the President shall, or any Senator may, call
him or her to order. If a Senator is so called to order, he or she
shall not proceed without leave of the Senate. If such leave is
granted, it must be upon the motion, “That he or she be allowed to
proceed in order,” and the Senator shall confine himself or herself
to the proposal under consideration and avoid personality.
2. Every ruling on points of order made by the President is
subject to appeal, and a discussion of a question of order may be
allowed only upon the appeal of two Senators. In all cases of
appeal, the question must be, “Shall the ruling of the Chair stand
as the judgment of the Senate?”
Rule No. 21. Breaches of Decorum.
1. In cases of breaches of decorum or propriety, any Senator,
officer or other person is liable to such censure or punishment as
the Senate may deem proper.
2. If any Senator is called to order for offensive or indecorous
language or conduct, the person calling the Senator to order shall
report the offensive or indecorous language or conduct to the
presiding officer. No member may be held to answer for any
language used on the floor of the Senate if business has
intervened before exception to the language was taken.
3. Indecorous conduct or boisterous or unbecoming language
is not permitted in the Senate Chamber.
Rule No. 22. Portable Electronic Communication Devices.
1. A person who is within the Senate Chambers shall not
engage in a telephone conversation via the use of a portable
telephone when the Senate is convened.
2. Before entering the Senate Chambers, any person who
possesses a portable electronic communication device that emits
an audible alert, such as a ringing or beeping sound, to signal an
incoming message or call, shall turn the audible alert off. A device
that contains a nonaudible alert, such as a silent vibration, may be
operated in a nonaudible manner within the Senate Chambers.
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 8 –
Rule No. 23. Committee on Ethics; Legislative Ethics.
1. The Committee on Ethics consists of:
(a) Two members of the Senate appointed by the Majority
Leader from the majority political party;
(b) One member of the Senate appointed by the Minority
Leader from the minority political party; and
(c) Three qualified electors of the State, two of whom are
appointed by the Majority Leader and one who is appointed by the
Minority Leader, and none of whom is a present member of the
Legislature or employed by the State of Nevada.
 Not more than four members of the Committee may be
members of the same political party.
2. The Majority Leader shall appoint the Chair and Vice
Chair of the Committee. The Vice Chair shall serve as the acting
Chair if the Chair is unable to serve for any reason during the
consideration of a specific proposal.
3. The Majority Leader shall appoint an alternate member
with the qualifications set forth in paragraph (a) of subsection 1
and an alternate member with the qualifications set forth in
paragraph (c) of subsection 1. The Minority Leader shall appoint
an alternate member with the qualifications set forth in paragraph
(b) of subsection 1 and an alternate member with the
qualifications set forth in paragraph (c) of subsection 1. If a
member of the Committee is unable to serve for any reason during
the consideration of a specific proposal, the alternate appointed
with the qualifications from the same paragraph in subsection 1
shall serve as a member of the Committee during the
consideration of the specific proposal.
4. A member of the Committee is disqualified to serve during
the consideration of a specific proposal if:
(a) The member is the requester of advice concerning the
question of ethics or conflict of interest, or the member is the
subject of the complaint concerning the specific question; or
(b) A reasonable person in the member’s situation could not
exercise independent judgment on the matter in question.
5. The members of the Committee shall perform any duty
required in the period between the time of their appointment after
the general election and the organization of the next succeeding
regular session, or until the Majority Leader or the Minority
Leader appoint new members to the Committee, whichever occurs
first.
6. The tenure of the members of the Committee shall extend
during the interim between regular sessions of the Legislature.
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 9 –
7. The Committee:
(a) May hear requests brought by Senators for advice on
specific questions of potential breaches of ethics and conflicts of
interest; and
(b) Shall hear complaints brought by Senators and others on
specific questions of alleged breaches of ethics and conflicts of
interest, including, without limitation, alleged breaches of the
Legislative Code of Ethical Standards in the Joint Standing Rules.
8. All proceedings held by the Committee to consider the
character, alleged misconduct, professional competence or
physical or mental health of any person on matters of ethics or
conflicts of interest and all materials related to those proceedings
are confidential, unless the person who is the subject of the
proceedings requests a public hearing or discloses the content of
the proceedings or materials.
9. An individual may file a complaint which alleges a breach
of ethics or a conflict of interest, including, without limitation, an
alleged breach of the Legislative Code of Ethical Standards in the
Joint Standing Rules. If the alleged breach of ethics or conflict of
interest involves the conduct of more than one person, separate
complaints must be filed regarding each person. A complaint must
be:
(a) Made in writing on a form provided by the Legislative
Counsel;
(b) Signed and verified under penalty of perjury by the
individual making the allegation; and
(c) Filed with the Legislative Counsel who shall review the
complaint and any other relevant information and consult with
the Chair of the Committee or, if the Chair is the subject of the
complaint, with the Vice Chair, to evaluate whether the Committee
has jurisdiction and whether an investigation is warranted in the
matter. If it is determined that the Committee:
(1) Does not have jurisdiction or that an investigation is not
warranted in the matter, the Legislative Counsel shall send written
notice of the determination to the individual who filed the
complaint.
(2) Has jurisdiction and an investigation is warranted in
the matter, the Legislative Counsel shall send written notice of the
determination and a copy of the complaint to the person who is the
subject of the complaint.
10. Each Legislator is subject, at all times, to the Legislative
Code of Ethical Standards in the Joint Standing Rules and, in
addition, must determine whether he or she has a conflict of
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 10 –
interest upon any matter in question before the Legislator. In
determining whether the Legislator has such a conflict of interest,
the Legislator should consider whether the independence of
judgment of a reasonable person in his or her situation upon the
matter in question would be materially affected by the
Legislator’s:
(a) Acceptance of a gift or loan;
(b) Private economic interest; or
(c) Commitment to a member of his or her household or
immediate family.
 In interpreting and applying the provisions of this subsection, it
must be presumed that the independence of judgment of a
reasonable person in the Legislator’s situation would not be
materially affected by the Legislator’s private economic interest or
the Legislator’s commitment to a member of his or her household
or immediate family where the resulting benefit or detriment
accruing to the Legislator, or if the Legislator has a commitment
to a member of his or her household or immediate family,
accruing to those other persons, is not greater than that accruing
to any other member of the general business, profession,
occupation or group that is affected by the matter.
11. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 12, if a
Legislator knows he or she has a conflict of interest pursuant to
subsection 10, the Legislator shall make a disclosure of the
conflict of interest on the record in a meeting of a committee or on
the floor of the Senate, as applicable. Such a disclosure must be
entered:
(a) If the Legislator makes the disclosure in a meeting of a
committee, in the minutes for that meeting.
(b) If the Legislator makes the disclosure on the floor of the
Senate, in the Journal.
12. If, on one or more prior occasions during the current
session of the Legislature, a Legislator has made a general
disclosure of a conflict of interest on the record in a meeting of a
committee or on the floor of the Senate, the Legislator is not
required to make that general disclosure at length again regarding
the same conflict of interest if, when the matter in question arises
on subsequent occasions, the Legislator makes a reference on the
record to the previous disclosure.
13. In determining whether to abstain from voting upon,
advocating or opposing a matter concerning which a Legislator
has a conflict of interest pursuant to subsection 10, the Legislator
should consider whether:
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 11 –
(a) The conflict impedes his or her independence of judgment;
and
(b) His or her interest is greater than the interests of an entire
class of persons similarly situated.
14. The provisions of this Rule do not under any
circumstances and regardless of any conflict of interest:
(a) Prohibit a Legislator from requesting or introducing a
legislative measure; or
(b) Require a Legislator to take any particular action before or
while requesting or introducing a legislative measure.
15. If a Legislator who is a member of a committee declares
on the record when a vote is to be taken by the committee that he
or she will abstain from voting because of the requirements of this
Rule, the necessary quorum to act upon and the number of votes
necessary to act upon the matter is reduced as though the
Legislator abstaining were not a member of the committee.
16. The standards and procedures set forth in this Rule which
govern whether and to what extent a Senator has a conflict of
interest, should disclose a conflict of interest or should abstain
from voting upon, advocating or opposing a matter concerning
which the Senator has a conflict of interest pursuant to
subsection 10:
(a) Are exclusive and are the only standards and procedures
that apply to Senators with regard to such matters; and
(b) Supersede and preempt all other standards and procedures
with regard to such matters,
 except that this subsection does not exempt any Senators from
the Legislative Code of Ethical Standards in the Joint Standing
Rules.
17. For purposes of this Rule, “immediate family” means a
person who is related to the Legislator by blood, adoption or
marriage within the first degree of consanguinity or affinity.
The next rule is 30.
IV. QUORUM, VOTING, ELECTIONS
Rule No. 30. Recorded Vote—Three Required to Call For.
1. A recorded vote must be taken upon final passage of a bill
or joint resolution, and in any other case when called for by three
members. Every Senator within the bar of the Senate shall vote
“yea” or “nay” or record himself or herself as “not voting,” unless
excused by unanimous vote of the Senate. A Senator who records
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 12 –
himself or herself as “not voting” must make a full and complete
disclosure of a conflict of interest pursuant to Senate Standing
Rule No. 23.
2. The votes and names of those absent or recorded as “not
voting” and the names of Senators demanding the recorded vote
must be entered in the Journal.
Rule No. 31. President to Decide—Tie Vote.
A question is lost by a tie vote, but when the Senate is equally
divided on any question except the passage of a bill or joint
resolution, the President may give the deciding vote.
Rule No. 32. Manner of Election—Voting.
1. In all cases of election by the Senate, the vote must be
taken viva voce. In other cases, if a vote is to be recorded, it may
be taken by oral roll-call or by electronic recording.
2. When a recorded vote is taken, no Senator may:
(a) Vote except when at his or her seat, unless authorized to
use a remote-technology system to vote pursuant to Senate
Standing Rule No. 136;
(b) Explain his or her vote or discuss the question while the
voting is in progress; or
(c) Change his or her vote after the result is announced.
3. The announcement of the result of any vote must not be
postponed.
The next rule is 40.
V. LEGISLATIVE BODIES
Rule No. 40. Standing and Select Committees.
1. Except as otherwise provided in Senate Standing Rule No.
23, the Majority Leader shall appoint all standing and select
committees and shall determine the majority-minority party
composition of all standing and select committees. Appointments
to committees shall be made by the Majority Leader for the
majority party members and by the Minority Leader for the
minority party members. The Majority Leader shall designate
the Chair and Vice Chair of all standing and select committees.
2. The Majority Leader shall refer prefiled bills and
resolutions to committee, subject to ratification by a majority vote
of the Senate once the Senate is organized and ready for business.
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 13 –
3. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 4, the standing
and select committees of the Senate and their respective
jurisdiction for the reference of bills and resolutions are as
follows:
(a) Commerce and Labor, eight members, with jurisdiction

read without interruption, consecutively, one following the other,
and not upon separate occasions; and no such bill or message
shall be referred to any committee, or otherwise acted upon, save
as provided by rule, custom and law; that is to say, that
immediately following such reading the only questions (except as

D. CONTESTS OF ELECTIONS
Rule No. 130. Procedure.
1. The Senate shall not dismiss a statement of contest for
want of form if any ground of contest is alleged with sufficient
certainty to inform the defendant of the charges he or she is
required to meet. The following grounds are sufficient, but are not
exclusive:
(a) That the election board or any member thereof was guilty
of malfeasance.
(b) That a person who has been declared elected to an office
was not at the time of election eligible to that office.
(c) That illegal votes were cast and counted for the defendant,
which, if taken from the defendant, will reduce the number of
legal votes below the number necessary to elect him or her.
(d) That the election board, in conducting the election or in
canvassing the returns, made errors sufficient to change the result
of the election as to any person who has been declared elected.
(e) That the defendant has given, or offered to give, to any
person a bribe for the purpose of procuring his or her election.
(f) That there was a possible malfunction of any voting or
counting device.
2. The contest must be submitted so far as may be possible
upon depositions or by written or oral arguments as the Senate
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 32 –
may order. Any party to a contest may take the deposition of any
witness at any time after the statement of contest is filed with the
Secretary of State and before the contest is finally decided. At least
5 days’ notice must be given to the prospective deponent and to the
other party. If oral statements are made at any hearing before the
Senate or a committee thereof which purport to establish matters
of fact, they must be made under oath. Strict rules of evidence do
not apply.
3. The contestant has the burden of proving that any
irregularities shown were of such nature as to establish the
probability that the result of the election was changed thereby.
After consideration of all the evidence, the Senate shall declare
the defendant elected unless the Senate finds from the evidence
that a person other than the defendant received the greatest
number of legal votes, in which case the Senate shall declare that
person elected.
E. REMOTE-TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS
Rule No. 131. Reserved.
Rule No. 132. Reserved.
Rule No. 133. Reserved.
Rule No. 134. Reserved.
Rule No. 135. Reserved.
Rule No. 136. Authorized Use of Remote-Technology Systems
in Exceptional Circumstances.
1. As used in this Rule, “remote-technology system” means
any system or other means of communication that is:
(a) Approved by the Majority Leader and uses any electronic,
digital or other similar technology to enable a member of the
Senate from a remote location to attend, participate, vote and take
any other action in any proceedings of the Senate or the
Committee of the Whole even though the member is not physically
present within the Senate Chambers or at a meeting of the
Committee of the Whole.
(b) Approved by the chair of a committee, other than the
Committee of the Whole, and uses any electronic, digital or other
similar technology to enable a member of the Senate from a
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 33 –
remote location to attend, participate, vote and take any other
action in any proceedings of the committee even though the
member is not physically present at a meeting of the committee.
2. Upon request by a member of the Senate:
(a) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, the
Majority Leader may authorize the member to use a remote-
technology system to attend, participate, vote and take any other
action in any proceedings of the Senate or the Committee of the
Whole if the Majority Leader determines that exceptional
circumstances warrant such use by the member. If the Majority
Leader grants such authorization:
(1) It must be entered in the Journal of the Senate.
(2) A member who uses a remote-technology system to
attend or participate in a proceeding of the Senate may not vote on
any matter on which a vote is taken in that proceeding unless the
member is using the remote-technology system to attend or
participate in the proceeding from a location in this State.
(b) The chair of a committee, other than the Committee of the
Whole, with the approval of the Majority Leader, may authorize
the member to use a remote-technology system to attend,
participate, vote and take any other action in any proceedings of
the committee if the chair and the Majority Leader determine that
exceptional circumstances warrant such use by the member. If the
chair grants such authorization, it must be entered in the records
of the committee.
3. Except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (2) of
paragraph (a) of subsection 2, if a member of the Senate uses a
remote-technology system to attend, participate, vote and take any
other action in any proceedings pursuant to this Rule, the member
shall be deemed to be present and in attendance at the proceedings
for all purposes.
4. For the purposes of voting in proceedings of:
(a) The Committee of the Whole, the Secretary of the Senate or
an authorized assistant shall call the roll of each member who is
authorized to use a remote-technology system for the proceedings
and, in accordance with the procedures of the Senate, cause the
member’s vote to be entered into the record for the purposes of the
records of the Committee of the Whole.
(b) A committee, other than the Committee of the Whole, the
committee secretary shall call the roll of each member who is
authorized to use a remote-technology system for the proceedings
and, in accordance with the procedures of the committee, cause
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 34 –
the member’s vote to be entered into the record for the purposes of
the records of the committee.
5. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 7 of Senate
Standing Rule No. 53, this Rule supersedes, takes precedence and
controls over any other rule, provision or principle of law to the
extent of any conflict with this Rule.
6. The Senate hereby finds and declares that:
(a) The Nevada Constitution invests each House of the
Legislature with certain plenary and exclusive constitutional
powers which may be exercised only by that House and which
cannot be usurped, infringed or impaired by the other House or by
any other branch of Nevada’s State Government. (Heller v.
Legislature, 120 Nev. 456 (2004); Commission on Ethics v. Hardy,
125 Nev. 285 (2009); Mason’s Manual of Legislative Procedure §§
2-3 & 560-564 (2010) (Mason’s Manual))
(b) Section 6 of Article 4 of the Nevada Constitution invests
each House with plenary and exclusive constitutional powers to
determine the rules of its proceedings and to govern, control and
regulate its membership and its internal organization, affairs and
management, expressly providing that: “Each House shall judge
of the qualifications, elections and returns of its own members,
choose its own officers (except the President of the Senate),
determine the rules of its proceedings and may punish its members
for disorderly conduct, and with the concurrence of two thirds of
all the members elected, expel a member.”
(c) In addition to its plenary and exclusive constitutional
powers, each House possesses certain inherent powers of
institutional self-protection and self-preservation to govern,
control and regulate its membership and its internal organization,
affairs and management. (In re Chapman, 166 U.S. 661, 668
(1897); Mason’s Manual § 2; Luther S. Cushing, Elements of the
Law & Practice of Legislative Assemblies § 533 (1856) (Cushing’s
Legislative Assemblies))
(d) The inherent powers of each House are considered “so
essential to the authority of a legislative assembly, that it cannot
well exist without them; and they are consequently entitled to be
regarded as belonging to every such assembly as a necessary
incident.” (Cushing’s Legislative Assemblies § 533)
(e) The inherent powers of each House authorize it to take all
necessary and proper institutional actions that are “recognized by
the common parliamentary law.” (Cushing’s Legislative
Assemblies § 684)
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 35 –
(f) Thus, it is well established that each House is “vested with
all the powers and privileges which are necessary and incidental to
a free and unobstructed exercise of its appropriate functions.
These powers and privileges are derived not from the Constitution;
on the contrary, they arise from the very creation of a legislative
body, and are founded upon the principle of self-preservation.”
(Ex parte McCarthy, 29 Cal. 395, 403 (1866))
(g) Under the Nevada Constitution, there are no constitutional
provisions establishing a particular method for determining
whether a member of either House is present at legislative
proceedings.
(h) The United States Supreme Court has held that when there
are no constitutional provisions establishing a particular method
for determining whether a member of a legislative house is present
at legislative proceedings, “it is therefore within the competency of
the house to prescribe any method which shall be reasonably
certain to ascertain the fact.” (United States v. Ballin, 144 U.S. 1,
6 (1892))
(i) The United States Supreme Court has also held that when a
legislative house adopts a rule establishing a reasonable method
for determining whether a member is present at legislative
proceedings, that rule must be given great deference by the courts
because:
Neither do the advantages or disadvantages, the wisdom or
folly, of such a rule present any matters for judicial
consideration. With the courts the question is only one of
power. The constitution empowers each house to determine
its rules of proceedings. It may not by its rules ignore
constitutional restraints or violate fundamental rights, and
there should be a reasonable relation between the mode or
method of proceeding established by the rule and the result
which is sought to be attained. But within these limitations
all matters of method are open to the determination of the
house, and it is no impeachment of the rule to say that some
other way would be better, more accurate, or even more just.
It is no objection to the validity of a rule that a different one
has been prescribed and in force for a length of time. The
power to make rules is not one which once exercised is
exhausted. It is a continuous power, always subject to be
exercised by the house, and, within the limitations
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 36 –
suggested, absolute and beyond the challenge of any other
body or tribunal.
(United States v. Ballin, 144 U.S. 1, 5 (1892))
7. The Senate hereby exercises its constitutional and inherent
powers and privileges and adopts this Rule to:
(a) Govern, control and regulate its membership and its
internal organization, affairs and management;
(b) Ensure its institutional self-protection and self-
preservation; and
(c) Establish a reasonable method for determining whether a
member of the Senate is present at legislative proceedings during
exceptional circumstances.
The next rule is 140.
IX. LEGISLATIVE INVESTIGATIONS
Rule No. 140. Compensation of Witnesses.
Witnesses summoned to appear before the Senate, or any of its
committees, shall be compensated as provided by law for witnesses
required to attend in the courts of the State of Nevada.
And be it further
RESOLVED, That this resolution becomes effective upon
adoption.
