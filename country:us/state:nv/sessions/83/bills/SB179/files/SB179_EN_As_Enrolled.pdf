CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to discrimination; revising provisions relating to
certain investigations conducted by the Nevada Equal Rights
Commission; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law prohibits various practices of discrimination based upon race,
religious creed, color, age, sex, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity or
expression, national origin or ancestry. (See, e.g., NRS 118.100, 613.330, 651.070)
Existing law also authorizes the Nevada Equal Rights Commission to investigate
tensions, practices of discrimination and acts of prejudice against any person or
group based on race, color, creed, sex, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender
identity or expression, national origin or ancestry. (NRS 233.150) This bill requires
the Commission, when conducting an investigation into an alleged unlawful
discriminatory practice in housing, employment or public accommodations, to
consider whether the practice was motivated by antisemitism. This bill also defines
the term “antisemitism” for the purpose of this requirement.

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
Section 1. Chapter 233 of NRS is hereby amended by adding
thereto a new section to read as follows:
1. When conducting an investigation into an alleged
unlawful discriminatory practice in housing, employment or
public accommodations, the Commission shall, for the purpose of
determining whether the alleged unlawful discriminatory practice
was based on the religious creed of a person or group, consider
whether the alleged unlawful discriminatory practice was
motivated by antisemitism.
2. As used in this section, “antisemitism” has the meaning
ascribed to the working definition of antisemitism adopted by the
International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance on May 26, 2016,
and includes, without limitation, the contemporary examples of
antisemitism published by the Alliance as guidance in connection
with that definition on that date.
