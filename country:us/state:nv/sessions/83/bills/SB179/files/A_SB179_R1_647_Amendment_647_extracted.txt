EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to discrimination; revising provisions relating to certain
investigations conducted by the Nevada Equal Rights Commission;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits various practices of discrimination based upon race, religious
2 creed, color, age, sex, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, national
3 origin or ancestry. (See, e.g., NRS 118.100, 613.330, 651.070) Existing law also authorizes
4 the Nevada Equal Rights Commission to investigate tensions, practices of discrimination and
5 acts of prejudice against any person or group based on race, color, creed, sex, age, disability,
6 sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, national origin or ancestry. (NRS 233.150)
7 This bill requires the Commission, when conducting an investigation into an alleged unlawful
8 discriminatory practice in housing, employment or public accommodations, to consider
9 whether the practice was motivated by antisemitism. This bill also defines the term
10 “antisemitism” for the purpose of this requirement.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 233 of NRS is hereby amended by adding thereto a new
2 section to read as follows:
3 1. When conducting an investigation into an alleged unlawful
4 discriminatory practice in housing, employment or public accommodations, the
5 Commission shall, for the purpose of determining whether the alleged unlawful
6 discriminatory practice was based on the religious creed of a person or group,
7 consider whether the alleged unlawful discriminatory practice was motivated by
8 antisemitism.
9 2. As used in this section, “antisemitism” [means a perception of Jewish
10 people which may be expressed as hatred toward Jewish people. The term
11 includes, without limitation, rhetorical and physical manifestations of
12 antisemitism directed toward:
13 (a) A Jewish person or non-Jewish person;

2 (c) The property of a Jewish person or non-Jewish person.] has the meaning
3 ascribed to the working definition of antisemitism adopted by the International
4 Holocaust Remembrance Alliance on May 26, 2016, and includes, without
5 limitation, the contemporary examples of antisemitism published by the Alliance
6 as guidance in connection with that definition on that date.
