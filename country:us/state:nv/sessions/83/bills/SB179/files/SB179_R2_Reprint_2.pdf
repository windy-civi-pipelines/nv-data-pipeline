5 tensions, practices of discrimination and acts of prejudice against any person or
6 group based on race, color, creed, sex, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender
7 identity or expression, national origin or ancestry. (NRS 233.150) This bill requires
8 the Commission, when conducting an investigation into an alleged unlawful
9 discriminatory practice in housing, employment or public accommodations, to

11 the term “antisemitism” for the purpose of this requirement.
