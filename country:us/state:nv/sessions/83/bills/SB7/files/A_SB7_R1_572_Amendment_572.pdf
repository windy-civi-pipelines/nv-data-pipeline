EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to criminal procedure; authorizing a court to waive the
requirement that the Division of Parole and Probation of the
Department of Public Safety make a presentence investigation and
report under certain circumstances; providing that a failure by the
Chief Parole and Probation Officer to submit a presentence
investigation and report before a sentencing hearing is not grounds for
an order of contempt under certain circumstances; revising
requirements relating to the disclosure of a presentence investigation
and report to a defendant; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Division of Parole and Probation of the Department of Public
2 Safety to make a presentence investigation and report to the court on certain defendants. (NRS
3 176.135) Section 1 of this bill authorizes the court to waive this requirement if the defendant
4 and the prosecuting attorney stipulate to waive the requirement and the court approves the
5 stipulation. Section 3 of this bill makes a conforming change to clarify that if the court waives
6 the requirement, the court may grant probation without receiving the presentence investigation
7 and report.
8 Existing law requires the Division to: (1) include a psychosexual evaluation as part of a
9 presentence investigation and report under certain circumstances; and (2) arrange for a
10 psychosexual evaluation of each defendant to whom this requirement applies. (NRS 176.135,
11 176.139) Existing law requires a person who conducts a psychosexual evaluation of a
12 defendant to provide a copy of the written report of the results of the evaluation to the
13 Division. (NRS 176.139) Section 1 provides that if the Division does not receive a copy of the
14 written report of the results of the evaluation at least 3 days before the sentencing hearing, a
15 failure by the Chief Parole and Probation Officer to submit the presentence investigation and
16 report before the sentencing hearing is not grounds for an order of contempt.
17 In general, existing law requires the Division to disclose the factual content of the report
18 of any presentence investigation made by the Division to the prosecuting attorney, the counsel
19 for the defendant, the defendant and the court not later than 14 calendar days before the

Assembly Amendment No. 572 to Senate Bill No. 7 First Reprint Page 4
20 defendant who is the subject of the report will be sentenced. (NRS 176.153) Section 2 of this
21 bill reduces that period to 7 calendar days.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 176.135 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 176.135 1. Except as otherwise provided in this section and NRS 176.151,
3 the Division shall make a presentence investigation and report to the court on each
4 defendant who pleads guilty, guilty but mentally ill or nolo contendere to, or is
5 found guilty or guilty but mentally ill of, a felony [.] unless:
6 (a) The defendant and the prosecuting attorney stipulate to waive the
7 requirement; and
8 (b) The court approves the stipulation.
9 2. If a defendant is convicted of a felony that is a sexual offense, the
10 presentence investigation and report:
11 (a) Must be made before the imposition of sentence or the granting of
12 probation; and
13 (b) If the sexual offense is an offense for which the suspension of sentence or
14 the granting of probation is permitted, must include a psychosexual evaluation of
15 the defendant.
16 3. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 5, if a defendant is convicted of
17 a felony other than a sexual offense, the presentence investigation and report must
18 be made before the imposition of sentence or the granting of probation unless:
19 (a) A sentence is fixed by a jury; or
20 (b) Such an investigation and report on the defendant has been made by the
21 Division within the 5 years immediately preceding the date initially set for
22 sentencing on the most recent offense.
23 4. Upon request of the court, the Division shall make presentence
24 investigations and reports on defendants who plead guilty, guilty but mentally ill or
25 nolo contendere to, or are found guilty or guilty but mentally ill of, gross
26 misdemeanors.
27 5. If a defendant is convicted of a felony other than a sexual offense or of a
28 gross misdemeanor and the conviction is of an offense for which the suspension of
29 sentence or the granting of probation is permitted, the Division shall, before the
30 imposition of sentence or the granting of probation, make a presentence
31 investigation and report to the court that includes a psychosexual evaluation of the
32 defendant if the defendant and the prosecuting attorney submit to the court a joint
33 request for a presentence investigation and report that includes a psychosexual
34 evaluation of the defendant. The provisions of this subsection apply only to a
35 conviction where the original charge in the complaint, information or indictment
36 was for a sexual offense, as defined in NRS 176.133 or 179D.097.
37 6. Each court in which a report of a presentence investigation can be made
38 must ensure that each judge of the court receives training concerning the manner in
39 which to use the information included in a report of a presentence investigation for
40 the purpose of imposing a sentence. Such training must include, without limitation,
41 education concerning behavioral health needs and intellectual or developmental
42 disabilities.
43 7. If the Division does not receive the written report of the results of a
44 psychosexual evaluation required by NRS 176.139 at least 3 days before the

Assembly Amendment No. 572 to Senate Bill No. 7 First Reprint Page 5
1 sentencing hearing, a failure by the Chief Parole and Probation Officer to submit
2 the presentence investigation and report before the sentencing hearing does not
3 constitute an act or omission that may serve as the basis for an order of contempt
4 pursuant to NRS 22.010 or 199.340.
5 Sec. 2. NRS 176.153 is hereby amended to read as follows:
6 176.153 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3, the Division shall
7 disclose to the prosecuting attorney, the counsel for the defendant, the defendant
8 and the court, not later than [14] 7 calendar days before the defendant will be
9 sentenced, the factual content of the report of any presentence investigation made
10 pursuant to NRS 176.135.
11 2. In addition to the disclosure requirements set forth in subsection 1, if the
12 Division includes in the report of any presentence investigation made pursuant to
13 NRS 176.135 any information relating to the defendant being affiliated with or a
14 member of a criminal gang and the Division reasonably believes such information
15 is disputed by the defendant, the Division shall provide with the information
16 disclosed pursuant to subsection 1 copies of all documentation relied upon by the
17 Division as a basis for including such information in the report, including, without
18 limitation, any field interview cards.
19 3. The defendant may waive the minimum period required by subsection 1.
20 4. As used in this section, “criminal gang” has the meaning ascribed to it in
21 NRS 193.168.
22 Sec. 3. NRS 176A.100 is hereby amended to read as follows:
23 176A.100 1. Except as otherwise provided in this section and NRS 176A.110
24 and 176A.120, if a person is found guilty in a district court upon verdict or plea of:
25 (a) Murder of the first or second degree, kidnapping in the first degree, sexual
26 assault, attempted sexual assault of a child who is less than 16 years of age,
27 lewdness with a child pursuant to NRS 201.230, an offense for which the
28 suspension of sentence or the granting of probation is expressly forbidden, or if the
29 person is found to be a habitual criminal pursuant to NRS 207.010, a habitually
30 fraudulent felon pursuant to NRS 207.014 or a habitual felon pursuant to NRS
31 207.012, the court shall not suspend the execution of the sentence imposed or grant
32 probation to the person.
33 (b) A category E felony, except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, the
34 court shall suspend the execution of the sentence imposed and grant probation to
35 the person. The court may, as it deems advisable, decide not to suspend the
36 execution of the sentence imposed and grant probation to the person if, at the time
37 of sentencing, it is established that the person had previously been two times
38 convicted, whether in this State or elsewhere, of a crime that under the laws of the
39 situs of the crime or of this State would amount to a felony. If the person denies the
40 existence of a previous conviction, the court shall determine the issue of the
41 previous conviction after hearing all relevant evidence presented on the issue by the
42 prosecution and the person. At such a hearing, the person may not challenge the
43 validity of a previous conviction. For the purposes of this paragraph, a certified
44 copy of a felony conviction is prima facie evidence of conviction of a prior felony.
45 (c) Another felony, a gross misdemeanor or a misdemeanor, the court may
46 suspend the execution of the sentence imposed and grant probation as the court
47 deems advisable.
48 2. In determining whether to grant probation to a person, the court shall not
49 consider whether the person has the financial ability to participate in a program of
50 probation secured by a surety bond established pursuant to NRS 176A.300 to
51 176A.370, inclusive.
52 3. If the court determines that a person is otherwise eligible for probation but
53 requires more supervision than would normally be provided to a person granted

Assembly Amendment No. 572 to Senate Bill No. 7 First Reprint Page 6
1 probation, the court may, in lieu of sentencing the person to a term of
2 imprisonment, grant probation pursuant to the Program of Enhanced Supervision
3 established pursuant to NRS 176A.440.
4 4. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, and unless the court
5 approves a stipulation waiving the requirement for the Division to make a
6 presentence investigation and report to the court pursuant to subsection 1 of NRS
7 176.135, if a person is convicted of a felony and the Division is required to make a
8 presentence investigation and report to the court pursuant to NRS 176.135, the
9 court shall not grant probation to the person until the court receives the report of the
10 presentence investigation from the Chief Parole and Probation Officer. The Chief
11 Parole and Probation Officer shall submit the report of the presentence
12 investigation to the court not later than 45 days after receiving a request for a
13 presentence investigation from the sentencing court or county clerk. If the report of
14 the presentence investigation is not submitted by the Chief Parole and Probation
15 Officer within 45 days, the court may grant probation without the report.
16 5. If the court determines that a person is otherwise eligible for probation, the
17 court shall, when determining the conditions of that probation, consider the
18 imposition of such conditions as would facilitate timely payments by the person of
19 an obligation, if any, for the support of a child and the payment of any such
20 obligation which is in arrears.
21 Sec. 4. The amendatory provisions of this act apply to any request for a
22 presentence investigation received by the Division of Parole and Probation of the
23 Department of Public Safety from a sentencing court or county clerk in this State
24 on or after July 1, 2025.
25 Sec. 5. This act becomes effective on July 1, 2025.
