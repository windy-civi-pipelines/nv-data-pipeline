EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to criminal procedure; authorizing a court to
waive the requirement that the Division of Parole and
Probation of the Department of Public Safety make a
presentence investigation and report under certain
circumstances; providing that a failure by the Chief Parole
and Probation Officer to submit a presentence
investigation and report before a sentencing hearing is not
grounds for an order of contempt under certain
circumstances; revising requirements relating to the
disclosure of a presentence investigation and report to a
defendant; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Division of Parole and Probation of the Department of
2 Public Safety to make a presentence investigation and report to the court on certain
3 defendants. (NRS 176.135) Section 1 of this bill authorizes the court to waive this
4 requirement if the defendant and the prosecuting attorney stipulate to waive the
5 requirement and the court approves the stipulation. Section 3 of this bill makes a
6 conforming change to clarify that if the court waives the requirement, the court may
7 grant probation without receiving the presentence investigation and report.
8 Existing law requires the Division to: (1) include a psychosexual evaluation as
9 part of a presentence investigation and report under certain circumstances; and (2)
10 arrange for a psychosexual evaluation of each defendant to whom this requirement
11 applies. (NRS 176.135, 176.139) Existing law requires a person who conducts a
12 psychosexual evaluation of a defendant to provide a copy of the written report of
-

– 2 –
13 the results of the evaluation to the Division. (NRS 176.139) Section 1 provides that
14 if the Division does not receive a copy of the written report of the results of the
15 evaluation at least 3 days before the sentencing hearing, a failure by the Chief
16 Parole and Probation Officer to submit the presentence investigation and report
17 before the sentencing hearing is not grounds for an order of contempt.
18 In general, existing law requires the Division to disclose the factual content of
19 the report of any presentence investigation made by the Division to the prosecuting
20 attorney, the counsel for the defendant, the defendant and the court not later than 14
21 calendar days before the defendant who is the subject of the report will be
22 sentenced. (NRS 176.153) Section 2 of this bill reduces that period to 7 calendar
23 days.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 176.135 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 176.135 1. Except as otherwise provided in this section and
3 NRS 176.151, the Division shall make a presentence investigation
4 and report to the court on each defendant who pleads guilty, guilty
5 but mentally ill or nolo contendere to, or is found guilty or guilty but
6 mentally ill of, a felony [.] unless:
7 (a) The defendant and the prosecuting attorney stipulate to
8 waive the requirement; and
9 (b) The court approves the stipulation.
10 2. If a defendant is convicted of a felony that is a sexual
11 offense, the presentence investigation and report:
12 (a) Must be made before the imposition of sentence or the
13 granting of probation; and
14 (b) If the sexual offense is an offense for which the suspension
15 of sentence or the granting of probation is permitted, must include a
16 psychosexual evaluation of the defendant.
17 3. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 5, if a defendant
18 is convicted of a felony other than a sexual offense, the presentence
19 investigation and report must be made before the imposition of
20 sentence or the granting of probation unless:
21 (a) A sentence is fixed by a jury; or
22 (b) Such an investigation and report on the defendant has been
23 made by the Division within the 5 years immediately preceding the
24 date initially set for sentencing on the most recent offense.
25 4. Upon request of the court, the Division shall make
26 presentence investigations and reports on defendants who plead
27 guilty, guilty but mentally ill or nolo contendere to, or are found
28 guilty or guilty but mentally ill of, gross misdemeanors.
29 5. If a defendant is convicted of a felony other than a sexual
30 offense or of a gross misdemeanor and the conviction is of an
31 offense for which the suspension of sentence or the granting of
-
*SB7_R1*

– 3 –
1 probation is permitted, the Division shall, before the imposition of
2 sentence or the granting of probation, make a presentence
3 investigation and report to the court that includes a psychosexual
4 evaluation of the defendant if the defendant and the prosecuting
5 attorney submit to the court a joint request for a presentence
6 investigation and report that includes a psychosexual evaluation of
7 the defendant. The provisions of this subsection apply only to a
8 conviction where the original charge in the complaint, information
9 or indictment was for a sexual offense, as defined in NRS 176.133
10 or 179D.097.
11 6. Each court in which a report of a presentence investigation
12 can be made must ensure that each judge of the court receives
13 training concerning the manner in which to use the information
14 included in a report of a presentence investigation for the purpose of
15 imposing a sentence. Such training must include, without limitation,
16 education concerning behavioral health needs and intellectual or
17 developmental disabilities.
18 7. If the Division does not receive the written report of the
19 results of a psychosexual evaluation required by NRS 176.139 at
20 least 3 days before the sentencing hearing, a failure by the Chief
21 Parole and Probation Officer to submit the presentence
22 investigation and report before the sentencing hearing does not
23 constitute an act or omission that may serve as the basis for an
24 order of contempt pursuant to NRS 22.010 or 199.340.
25 Sec. 2. NRS 176.153 is hereby amended to read as follows:
26 176.153 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3, the
27 Division shall disclose to the prosecuting attorney, the counsel for
28 the defendant, the defendant and the court, not later than [14] 7
29 calendar days before the defendant will be sentenced, the factual
30 content of the report of any presentence investigation made pursuant
31 to NRS 176.135.
32 2. In addition to the disclosure requirements set forth in
33 subsection 1, if the Division includes in the report of any
34 presentence investigation made pursuant to NRS 176.135 any
35 information relating to the defendant being affiliated with or a
36 member of a criminal gang and the Division reasonably believes
37 such information is disputed by the defendant, the Division shall
38 provide with the information disclosed pursuant to subsection 1
39 copies of all documentation relied upon by the Division as a basis
40 for including such information in the report, including, without
41 limitation, any field interview cards.
42 3. The defendant may waive the minimum period required by
43 subsection 1.
44 4. As used in this section, “criminal gang” has the meaning
45 ascribed to it in NRS 193.168.

1 Sec. 3. NRS 176A.100 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 176A.100 1. Except as otherwise provided in this section and
3 NRS 176A.110 and 176A.120, if a person is found guilty in a
4 district court upon verdict or plea of:
5 (a) Murder of the first or second degree, kidnapping in the first
6 degree, sexual assault, attempted sexual assault of a child who is
7 less than 16 years of age, lewdness with a child pursuant to NRS
8 201.230, an offense for which the suspension of sentence or the
9 granting of probation is expressly forbidden, or if the person is
10 found to be a habitual criminal pursuant to NRS 207.010, a
11 habitually fraudulent felon pursuant to NRS 207.014 or a habitual
12 felon pursuant to NRS 207.012, the court shall not suspend the
13 execution of the sentence imposed or grant probation to the person.
14 (b) A category E felony, except as otherwise provided in this
15 paragraph, the court shall suspend the execution of the sentence
16 imposed and grant probation to the person. The court may, as it
17 deems advisable, decide not to suspend the execution of the
18 sentence imposed and grant probation to the person if, at the time of
19 sentencing, it is established that the person had previously been two
20 times convicted, whether in this State or elsewhere, of a crime that
21 under the laws of the situs of the crime or of this State would
22 amount to a felony. If the person denies the existence of a previous
23 conviction, the court shall determine the issue of the previous
24 conviction after hearing all relevant evidence presented on the issue
25 by the prosecution and the person. At such a hearing, the person
26 may not challenge the validity of a previous conviction. For the
27 purposes of this paragraph, a certified copy of a felony conviction is
28 prima facie evidence of conviction of a prior felony.
29 (c) Another felony, a gross misdemeanor or a misdemeanor, the
30 court may suspend the execution of the sentence imposed and grant
31 probation as the court deems advisable.
32 2. In determining whether to grant probation to a person, the
33 court shall not consider whether the person has the financial ability
34 to participate in a program of probation secured by a surety bond
35 established pursuant to NRS 176A.300 to 176A.370, inclusive.
36 3. If the court determines that a person is otherwise eligible for
37 probation but requires more supervision than would normally be
38 provided to a person granted probation, the court may, in lieu of
39 sentencing the person to a term of imprisonment, grant probation
40 pursuant to the Program of Enhanced Supervision established
41 pursuant to NRS 176A.440.
42 4. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, and unless
43 the court approves a stipulation waiving the requirement for the
44 Division to make a presentence investigation and report to the
45 court pursuant to subsection 1 of NRS 176.135, if a person is
-

– 5 –
1 convicted of a felony and the Division is required to make a
2 presentence investigation and report to the court pursuant to NRS
3 176.135, the court shall not grant probation to the person until the
4 court receives the report of the presentence investigation from the
5 Chief Parole and Probation Officer. The Chief Parole and Probation
6 Officer shall submit the report of the presentence investigation to
7 the court not later than 45 days after receiving a request for a
8 presentence investigation from the county clerk. If the report of the
9 presentence investigation is not submitted by the Chief Parole and
10 Probation Officer within 45 days, the court may grant probation
11 without the report.
12 5. If the court determines that a person is otherwise eligible for
13 probation, the court shall, when determining the conditions of that
14 probation, consider the imposition of such conditions as would
15 facilitate timely payments by the person of an obligation, if any, for
16 the support of a child and the payment of any such obligation which
17 is in arrears.
18 Sec. 4. The amendatory provisions of this act apply to any
19 request for a presentence investigation received by the Division of
20 Parole and Probation of the Department of Public Safety from a
21 county clerk in this State on or after July 1, 2025.
22 Sec. 5. This act becomes effective on July 1, 2025.
