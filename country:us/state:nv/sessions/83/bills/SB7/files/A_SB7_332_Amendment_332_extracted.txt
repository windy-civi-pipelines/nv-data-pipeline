Referred to Committee on Judiciary
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to presentence investigations and
reports. (BDR 14-247)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to criminal procedure; [reorganizing certain provisions related]
authorizing a court to waive the requirement that the Division of
Parole and Probation of the Department of Public Safety make a
presentence [investigations] investigation and [reports; revising
requirements relating to a presentence investigation and report that
must include a psychosexual evaluation of the defendant; clarifying
certain requirements governing the submission of a presentence
investigation and report and the disclosure of the factual contents of
any such report;] report under certain circumstances; providing
that a failure by the Chief Parole and Probation Officer to submit
a presentence investigation and report before a sentencing hearing
is not grounds for an order of contempt under certain
circumstances; revising requirements relating to the disclosure of a
presentence investigation and report to a defendant; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Division of Parole and Probation of the Department of Public
2 Safety to make a presentence investigation and report to the court on certain defendants. (NRS
3 176.135) [Under existing law, the Chief Parole and Probation Officer must submit any such
4 report to the court not later than 45 days after receiving a request for a presentence
5 investigation from the county clerk. (NRS 176A.100) Sections] Section 1 [and 3] of this bill
6 [reorganize this requirement.] authorizes the court to waive this requirement if the
7 defendant and the prosecuting attorney stipulate to waive the requirement and the court
8 approves the stipulation. Section 3 of this bill makes a conforming change to clarify that
9 if the court waives the requirement, the court may grant probation without receiving the
10 presentence investigation and report.
11 Existing law requires the Division to: (1) include a psychosexual evaluation as part of a
12 presentence investigation and report under certain circumstances; and (2) arrange for a
Senate Amendment No. 332 to Senate Bill No. 7 Page 4
13 psychosexual evaluation of each defendant to whom this requirement applies. (NRS 176.135,
14 176.139) Existing law requires a person who conducts a psychosexual evaluation of a
15 defendant to provide a copy of the written report of the results of the evaluation to the
16 Division. (NRS 176.139) [If] Section 1 provides that if the Division [has] does not [received]
17 receive a copy of the written report of the results of the evaluation [within 45 days after
18 receiving the request for a presentence investigation from the county clerk, section 1 provides
19 that] at least 3 days before the sentencing hearing, a failure by the Chief Parole and
20 Probation Officer [is not required] to submit the presentence investigation and report [to the
21 court until 3 days after the date on which the Division receives a copy of the written report.]
22 before the sentencing hearing is not grounds for an order of contempt.
23 In general, existing law requires the Division to disclose the factual content of the report
24 of any presentence investigation made by the Division to the prosecuting attorney, the counsel
25 for the defendant, the defendant and the court not later than 14 calendar days before the
26 defendant who is the subject of the report will be sentenced. (NRS 176.153) [Sections 1 and]
27 Section 2 of this bill [clarify] reduces that [this 14-day] period [is separate from, independent
28 of and in addition to the 45-day period within which existing law requires the Chief Parole
29 and Probation Officer to submit the report of any presentence investigation made by the
30 Division to the court.] to 7 calendar days.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 176.135 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 176.135 1. Except as otherwise provided in this section and NRS 176.151,
3 the Division shall make a presentence investigation and report to the court on each
4 defendant who pleads guilty, guilty but mentally ill or nolo contendere to, or is
5 found guilty or guilty but mentally ill of, a felony [.] unless:
6 (a) The defendant and the prosecuting attorney stipulate to waive the
7 requirement; and
8 (b) The court approves the stipulation.
9 2. If a defendant is convicted of a felony that is a sexual offense, the
10 presentence investigation and report:
11 (a) Must be made before the imposition of sentence or the granting of
12 probation; and
13 (b) If the sexual offense is an offense for which the suspension of sentence or
14 the granting of probation is permitted, must include a psychosexual evaluation of
15 the defendant.
16 3. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 5, if a defendant is convicted of
17 a felony other than a sexual offense, the presentence investigation and report must
18 be made before the imposition of sentence or the granting of probation unless:
19 (a) A sentence is fixed by a jury; or
20 (b) Such an investigation and report on the defendant has been made by the
21 Division within the 5 years immediately preceding the date initially set for
22 sentencing on the most recent offense.
23 4. Upon request of the court, the Division shall make presentence
24 investigations and reports on defendants who plead guilty, guilty but mentally ill or
25 nolo contendere to, or are found guilty or guilty but mentally ill of, gross
26 misdemeanors.
27 5. If a defendant is convicted of a felony other than a sexual offense or of a
28 gross misdemeanor and the conviction is of an offense for which the suspension of
29 sentence or the granting of probation is permitted, the Division shall, before the
30 imposition of sentence or the granting of probation, make a presentence
31 investigation and report to the court that includes a psychosexual evaluation of the
Senate Amendment No. 332 to Senate Bill No. 7 Page 5
1 defendant if the defendant and the prosecuting attorney submit to the court a joint
2 request for a presentence investigation and report that includes a psychosexual
3 evaluation of the defendant. The provisions of this subsection apply only to a
4 conviction where the original charge in the complaint, information or indictment
5 was for a sexual offense, as defined in NRS 176.133 or 179D.097.
6 6. Each court in which a report of a presentence investigation can be made
7 must ensure that each judge of the court receives training concerning the manner in
8 which to use the information included in a report of a presentence investigation for
9 the purpose of imposing a sentence. Such training must include, without limitation,
10 education concerning behavioral health needs and intellectual or developmental
11 disabilities.
12 7. [Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the Chief Parole and
13 Probation Officer shall submit a presentence investigation and report required
14 pursuant to this section to the court not later than 45 days after receiving the
15 request for a presentence investigation from the county clerk.] If the Division
16 [has] does not [received a copy of] receive the written report of the results of a
17 psychosexual evaluation required by NRS 176.139 [within] at least 3 days before
18 the [45-day period,] sentencing hearing, a failure by the Chief Parole and
19 Probation Officer [is not required] to submit the presentence investigation and
20 report [until 3 days after the date on which the Division receives a copy of the
21 written report.
22 8. The period specified in subsection 7 is separate from, independent of and
23 in addition to the minimum period specified in NRS 176.153.] before the
24 sentencing hearing does not constitute an act or omission that may serve as the
25 basis for an order of contempt pursuant to NRS 22.010 or 199.340.
26 Sec. 2. NRS 176.153 is hereby amended to read as follows:
27 176.153 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3, the Division shall
28 disclose to the prosecuting attorney, the counsel for the defendant, the defendant
29 and the court, not later than [14] 7 calendar days before the defendant will be
30 sentenced, the factual content of the report of any presentence investigation made
31 pursuant to NRS 176.135.
32 2. In addition to the disclosure requirements set forth in subsection 1, if the
33 Division includes in the report of any presentence investigation made pursuant to
34 NRS 176.135 any information relating to the defendant being affiliated with or a
35 member of a criminal gang and the Division reasonably believes such information
36 is disputed by the defendant, the Division shall provide with the information
37 disclosed pursuant to subsection 1 copies of all documentation relied upon by the
38 Division as a basis for including such information in the report, including, without
39 limitation, any field interview cards.
40 3. The defendant may waive the minimum period required by subsection 1.
41 4. [The minimum period required by subsection 1 is separate from,
42 independent of and in addition to the period specified in subsection 7 of NRS
43 176.135.
44 5.] As used in this section, “criminal gang” has the meaning ascribed to it in
45 NRS 193.168.
46 Sec. 3. NRS 176A.100 is hereby amended to read as follows:
47 176A.100 1. Except as otherwise provided in this section and NRS 176A.110
48 and 176A.120, if a person is found guilty in a district court upon verdict or plea of:
49 (a) Murder of the first or second degree, kidnapping in the first degree, sexual
50 assault, attempted sexual assault of a child who is less than 16 years of age,
51 lewdness with a child pursuant to NRS 201.230, an offense for which the
52 suspension of sentence or the granting of probation is expressly forbidden, or if the
53 person is found to be a habitual criminal pursuant to NRS 207.010, a habitually
Senate Amendment No. 332 to Senate Bill No. 7 Page 6
1 fraudulent felon pursuant to NRS 207.014 or a habitual felon pursuant to NRS
2 207.012, the court shall not suspend the execution of the sentence imposed or grant
3 probation to the person.
4 (b) A category E felony, except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, the
5 court shall suspend the execution of the sentence imposed and grant probation to
6 the person. The court may, as it deems advisable, decide not to suspend the
7 execution of the sentence imposed and grant probation to the person if, at the time
8 of sentencing, it is established that the person had previously been two times
9 convicted, whether in this State or elsewhere, of a crime that under the laws of the
10 situs of the crime or of this State would amount to a felony. If the person denies the
11 existence of a previous conviction, the court shall determine the issue of the
12 previous conviction after hearing all relevant evidence presented on the issue by the
13 prosecution and the person. At such a hearing, the person may not challenge the
14 validity of a previous conviction. For the purposes of this paragraph, a certified
15 copy of a felony conviction is prima facie evidence of conviction of a prior felony.
16 (c) Another felony, a gross misdemeanor or a misdemeanor, the court may
17 suspend the execution of the sentence imposed and grant probation as the court
18 deems advisable.
19 2. In determining whether to grant probation to a person, the court shall not
20 consider whether the person has the financial ability to participate in a program of
21 probation secured by a surety bond established pursuant to NRS 176A.300 to
22 176A.370, inclusive.
23 3. If the court determines that a person is otherwise eligible for probation but
24 requires more supervision than would normally be provided to a person granted
25 probation, the court may, in lieu of sentencing the person to a term of
26 imprisonment, grant probation pursuant to the Program of Enhanced Supervision
27 established pursuant to NRS 176A.440.
28 4. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, and unless the court
29 approves a stipulation waiving the requirement for the Division to make a
30 presentence investigation and report to the court pursuant to subsection 1 of NRS
31 176.135, if a person is convicted of a felony and the Division is required to make a
32 presentence investigation and report to the court pursuant to NRS 176.135, the
33 court shall not grant probation to the person until the court receives the report of the
34 presentence investigation from the Chief Parole and Probation Officer. The Chief
35 Parole and Probation Officer shall submit the report of the presentence
36 investigation to the court not later than 45 days after receiving a request for a
37 presentence investigation from the county clerk. If the report of the presentence
38 investigation is not submitted by the Chief Parole and Probation Officer within 45
39 days, [the period specified in subsection 7 of NRS 176.135,] the court may grant
40 probation without the report.
41 5. If the court determines that a person is otherwise eligible for probation, the
42 court shall, when determining the conditions of that probation, consider the
43 imposition of such conditions as would facilitate timely payments by the person of
44 an obligation, if any, for the support of a child and the payment of any such
45 obligation which is in arrears.
46 Sec. 4. The amendatory provisions of this act apply to any request for a
47 presentence investigation received by the Division of Parole and Probation of the
48 Department of Public Safety from a county clerk in this State on or after July 1,
49 2025.
50 Sec. 5. This act becomes effective on July 1, 2025.

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to criminal procedure; [reorganizing certain provisions related]
authorizing a court to waive the requirement that the Division of
Parole and Probation of the Department of Public Safety make a
presentence [investigations] investigation and [reports; revising
requirements relating to a presentence investigation and report that
must include a psychosexual evaluation of the defendant; clarifying
certain requirements governing the submission of a presentence

a presentence investigation and report before a sentencing hearing
is not grounds for an order of contempt under certain
circumstances; revising requirements relating to the disclosure of a
presentence investigation and report to a defendant; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Division of Parole and Probation of the Department of Public
2 Safety to make a presentence investigation and report to the court on certain defendants. (NRS
3 176.135) [Under existing law, the Chief Parole and Probation Officer must submit any such
4 report to the court not later than 45 days after receiving a request for a presentence
5 investigation from the county clerk. (NRS 176A.100) Sections] Section 1 [and 3] of this bill
6 [reorganize this requirement.] authorizes the court to waive this requirement if the
7 defendant and the prosecuting attorney stipulate to waive the requirement and the court
8 approves the stipulation. Section 3 of this bill makes a conforming change to clarify that
9 if the court waives the requirement, the court may grant probation without receiving the
10 presentence investigation and report.
11 Existing law requires the Division to: (1) include a psychosexual evaluation as part of a
12 presentence investigation and report under certain circumstances; and (2) arrange for a

Senate Amendment No. 332 to Senate Bill No. 7 Page 4
13 psychosexual evaluation of each defendant to whom this requirement applies. (NRS 176.135,
14 176.139) Existing law requires a person who conducts a psychosexual evaluation of a

16 Division. (NRS 176.139) [If] Section 1 provides that if the Division [has] does not [received]
17 receive a copy of the written report of the results of the evaluation [within 45 days after
18 receiving the request for a presentence investigation from the county clerk, section 1 provides
19 that] at least 3 days before the sentencing hearing, a failure by the Chief Parole and
20 Probation Officer [is not required] to submit the presentence investigation and report [to the
21 court until 3 days after the date on which the Division receives a copy of the written report.]
22 before the sentencing hearing is not grounds for an order of contempt.
23 In general, existing law requires the Division to disclose the factual content of the report
24 of any presentence investigation made by the Division to the prosecuting attorney, the counsel
25 for the defendant, the defendant and the court not later than 14 calendar days before the
26 defendant who is the subject of the report will be sentenced. (NRS 176.153) [Sections 1 and]
27 Section 2 of this bill [clarify] reduces that [this 14-day] period [is separate from, independent
28 of and in addition to the 45-day period within which existing law requires the Chief Parole
29 and Probation Officer to submit the report of any presentence investigation made by the
30 Division to the court.] to 7 calendar days.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN

1 fraudulent felon pursuant to NRS 207.014 or a habitual felon pursuant to NRS
2 207.012, the court shall not suspend the execution of the sentence imposed or grant
3 probation to the person.
4 (b) A category E felony, except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, the
5 court shall suspend the execution of the sentence imposed and grant probation to
6 the person. The court may, as it deems advisable, decide not to suspend the
7 execution of the sentence imposed and grant probation to the person if, at the time
8 of sentencing, it is established that the person had previously been two times
9 convicted, whether in this State or elsewhere, of a crime that under the laws of the
10 situs of the crime or of this State would amount to a felony. If the person denies the
11 existence of a previous conviction, the court shall determine the issue of the
12 previous conviction after hearing all relevant evidence presented on the issue by the
13 prosecution and the person. At such a hearing, the person may not challenge the
14 validity of a previous conviction. For the purposes of this paragraph, a certified
15 copy of a felony conviction is prima facie evidence of conviction of a prior felony.
16 (c) Another felony, a gross misdemeanor or a misdemeanor, the court may
17 suspend the execution of the sentence imposed and grant probation as the court
18 deems advisable.
19 2. In determining whether to grant probation to a person, the court shall not
20 consider whether the person has the financial ability to participate in a program of
21 probation secured by a surety bond established pursuant to NRS 176A.300 to
22 176A.370, inclusive.
23 3. If the court determines that a person is otherwise eligible for probation but
24 requires more supervision than would normally be provided to a person granted
25 probation, the court may, in lieu of sentencing the person to a term of
26 imprisonment, grant probation pursuant to the Program of Enhanced Supervision
27 established pursuant to NRS 176A.440.
28 4. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, and unless the court
29 approves a stipulation waiving the requirement for the Division to make a
30 presentence investigation and report to the court pursuant to subsection 1 of NRS
31 176.135, if a person is convicted of a felony and the Division is required to make a
32 presentence investigation and report to the court pursuant to NRS 176.135, the
33 court shall not grant probation to the person until the court receives the report of the
34 presentence investigation from the Chief Parole and Probation Officer. The Chief
35 Parole and Probation Officer shall submit the report of the presentence
36 investigation to the court not later than 45 days after receiving a request for a
37 presentence investigation from the county clerk. If the report of the presentence
38 investigation is not submitted by the Chief Parole and Probation Officer within 45
39 days, [the period specified in subsection 7 of NRS 176.135,] the court may grant
40 probation without the report.
41 5. If the court determines that a person is otherwise eligible for probation, the
42 court shall, when determining the conditions of that probation, consider the
43 imposition of such conditions as would facilitate timely payments by the person of
44 an obligation, if any, for the support of a child and the payment of any such
45 obligation which is in arrears.
46 Sec. 4. The amendatory provisions of this act apply to any request for a
47 presentence investigation received by the Division of Parole and Probation of the
48 Department of Public Safety from a county clerk in this State on or after July 1,
49 2025.
50 Sec. 5. This act becomes effective on July 1, 2025.
