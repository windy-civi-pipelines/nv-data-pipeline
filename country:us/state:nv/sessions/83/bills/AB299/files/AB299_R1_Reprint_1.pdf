EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to crimes; increasing the penalties for a customer
who unlawfully engages in prostitution or solicitation
therefor; requiring a peace officer to make an arrest with
or without a warrant under certain circumstances; revising
requirements for the automatic sealing of records in
certain circumstances; revising provisions relating to
certain civil actions involving prostitution and solicitation
for prostitution; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits a customer from engaging in prostitution or solicitation
2 for prostitution except in a licensed house of prostitution. Existing law provides that
3 a customer who violates such a prohibition: (1) for a first offense that involves an
4 adult, is guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by imprisonment in the county jail for
5 not more than 6 months and by a fine of not less than $400 but not more than
6 $1,000; (2) for a subsequent offense that involves an adult, is guilty of a gross
7 misdemeanor, punishable by imprisonment in the county jail for not more than 364
8 days and by certain minimum fines; and (3) for any offense, is subject to a civil
9 penalty of not less than $200 per offense. Additionally, existing law provides for
10 the automatic sealing of records if a person is discharged and the proceedings
11 against the person are dismissed upon the fulfillment of the terms and conditions
12 of a court-ordered program for the treatment of persons who solicit prostitution.

14 Section 1 of this bill: (1) requires a peace officer to arrest a person if the peace
15 officer has probable cause to believe that the person has violated such a prohibition;
16 (2) increases the minimum fine for a first offense to not less than $800; (3)
17 increases the civil penalty for any offense to $600; and (4) authorizes a person to
18 petition the court 2 years after the person is discharged and the proceedings against
19 the person are dismissed for the sealing of all records relating to the discharge and
20 dismissal.
21 Existing law generally provides that when a person suffers an injury as the
22 proximate result of a wrongful act, the person who caused the injury is liable to the
23 person injured for damages. (NRS 41.130) In general, existing law requires a civil
24 action to recover damages for injuries arising from the wrongful act of another
25 person to be commenced within 2 years after the date on which the wrongful act
26 occurred. (NRS 11.190) Existing law exempts certain civil actions from this
27 requirement, including a civil action to recover damages for sexual exploitation, if
28 the sexual exploitation occurred when the plaintiff was less than 18 years of age.
29 For purposes of this exemption, existing law defines sexual exploitation to include
30 forcing, allowing or encouraging a child to solicit for or engage in prostitution.
31 Therefore, under existing law, a civil action to recover damages for prostitution or
32 solicitation for prostitution may be commenced at any time, if the prostitution or
33 solicitation for prostitution occurred when the plaintiff was less than 18 years of
34 age. (NRS 11.215, 432B.110)
35 Section 1.6 of this bill specifically authorizes a person who has suffered an
36 injury as the proximate result of unlawful prostitution or solicitation for prostitution
37 to bring a civil action to recover damages for injuries arising from the prostitution
38 or solicitation for prostitution against the person convicted of the offense. Section
39 1.4 of this bill exempts a civil action brought pursuant to section 1.2 from the
40 generally applicable 2-year statute of limitations prescribed by existing law.
41 Section 1.2 of this bill provides that a civil action brought pursuant to section 1.6
42 must be commenced within 20 years after the date on which the violation occurred,
43 unless an exception applies. Section 1.4 exempts a civil action to recover damages
44 for injuries arising from unlawful prostitution or solicitation for prostitution from
45 the 20-year statute of limitations prescribed by section 1.2 if the prostitution or
46 solicitation for prostitution occurred when the plaintiff was less than 18 years of
47 age. Consistent with existing law, any such civil action may be commenced at any
48 time. (NRS 11.215, 432B.110)
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 201.354 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 201.354 1. It is unlawful for a customer to engage in
3 prostitution or solicitation therefor, except in a licensed house of
4 prostitution. Whether or not a warrant has been issued, a peace
5 officer shall arrest a person if the peace officer has probable cause
6 to believe that the person to be arrested has violated this section.
7 2. Any person who violates subsection 1 by soliciting for
8 prostitution:
9 (a) A child;
10 (b) A peace officer who is posing as a child; or
-
*AB299_R1*

– 3 –
1 (c) A person who is assisting in an investigation on behalf of a
2 peace officer by posing as a child,
3  is guilty of soliciting a child for prostitution.
4 3. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 5, a person who
5 violates this section:
6 (a) For a first offense, is guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be
7 punished as provided in NRS 193.150, and by a fine of not less than
8 [$400.] $800.
9 (b) For a second offense, is guilty of a gross misdemeanor and
10 shall be punished as provided in NRS 193.140, and by a fine of not
11 less than $800.
12 (c) For a third or subsequent offense, is guilty of a gross
13 misdemeanor and shall be punished as provided in NRS 193.140,
14 and by a fine of not less than $1,300.
15 4. In addition to any other penalty imposed, the court shall
16 order a person who violates subsection 1 to pay a civil penalty of not
17 less than [$200] $600 per offense. The civil penalty must be paid to
18 the district attorney or city attorney of the jurisdiction in which the
19 violation occurred. If the civil penalty imposed pursuant to this
20 subsection:
21 (a) Is not within the person’s present ability to pay, in lieu of
22 paying the penalty, the court may allow the person to perform
23 community service for a reasonable number of hours, the value of
24 which would be commensurate with the civil penalty.
25 (b) Is not entirely within the person’s present ability to pay, in
26 lieu of paying the entire civil penalty, the court may allow the
27 person to perform community service for a reasonable number of
28 hours, the value of which would be commensurate with the amount
29 of the reduction of the civil penalty.
30 5. A person who violates this section by soliciting a child for
31 prostitution:
32 (a) For a first offense, is guilty of a category D felony and shall
33 be punished as provided in NRS 193.130, and by a fine of not more
34 than $5,000.
35 (b) For a second offense, is guilty of a category C felony and
36 shall be punished as provided in NRS 193.130.
37 (c) For a third or subsequent offense, is guilty of a category B
38 felony and shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for
39 a minimum term of not less than 1 year and maximum term of not
40 more than 6 years, and may be further punished by a fine of not
41 more than $15,000. The court shall not grant probation to or suspend
42 the sentence of a person punished pursuant to this paragraph.
43 6. Any civil penalty collected by a district attorney or city
44 attorney pursuant to subsection 4 must be deposited in the county or
45 city treasury, as applicable, to be used for:
-
*AB299_R1*

– 4 –
1 (a) The enforcement of this section; and
2 (b) Programs of treatment for persons who solicit prostitution
3 which are certified by the Division of Public and Behavioral Health
4 of the Department of Health and Human Services.
5  Not less than 50 percent of the money deposited in the county or
6 city treasury, as applicable, pursuant to this subsection must be used
7 for the enforcement of this section.
8 7. If a person who violates subsection 1 is ordered pursuant to
9 NRS 4.373 or 5.055 to participate in a program for the treatment of
10 persons who solicit prostitution, upon fulfillment of the terms and
11 conditions of the program, the court may discharge the person and
12 dismiss the proceedings against the person. If the court discharges
13 the person and dismisses the proceedings against the person, a
14 nonpublic record of the discharge and dismissal must be transmitted
15 to and retained by the Division of Parole and Probation of the
16 Department of Public Safety solely for the use of the courts in
17 determining whether, in later proceedings, the person qualifies
18 under this section for participation in a program of treatment for
19 persons who solicit prostitution. Except as otherwise provided in
20 this subsection, discharge and dismissal under this subsection is
21 without adjudication of guilt and is not a conviction for purposes of
22 employment, civil rights or any statute or regulation or license or
23 questionnaire or for any other public or private purpose, but is a
24 conviction for the purpose of additional penalties imposed for a
25 second or subsequent conviction or the setting of bail. Discharge
26 and dismissal restores the person discharged, in the contemplation
27 of the law, to the status occupied before the proceedings. The person
28 may not be held thereafter under any law to be guilty of perjury or
29 otherwise giving a false statement by reason of failure to recite or
30 acknowledge the proceedings in response to an inquiry made of the
31 person for any purpose. Discharge and dismissal under this
32 subsection may occur only once with respect to any person. A
33 professional licensing board may consider a proceeding under this
34 subsection in determining suitability for a license or liability to
35 discipline for misconduct. Such a board is entitled for those
36 purposes to a truthful answer from the applicant or licensee
37 concerning any such proceeding with respect to the applicant or
38 licensee.
39 8. Except as limited by subsection 9, if a person is discharged
40 and the proceedings against the person are dismissed pursuant to
41 subsection 7, the [court shall, without a hearing,] person may
42 petition the court for the sealing of all records relating to the
43 discharge and dismissal 2 years after the date of the dismissal. The
44 court may order sealed all documents, papers and exhibits in that
45 person’s record, minute book entries and entries on dockets, and
-
*AB299_R1*

– 5 –
1 other documents relating to the case in the custody of such other
2 agencies and officers as are named in the court’s order. The court
3 shall cause a copy of the order to be sent to each agency or officer
4 named in the order. Each such agency or officer shall notify the
5 court in writing of its compliance with the order.
6 9. A professional licensing board is entitled, for the purpose of
7 determining suitability for a license or liability to discipline for
8 misconduct, to inspect and to copy from a record sealed pursuant to
9 this section.
10 Sec. 1.2. Chapter 11 of NRS is hereby amended by adding
11 thereto a new section to read as follows:
12 Except as otherwise provided in NRS 11.215, an action to
13 recover damages pursuant to section 1.6 of this act must be
14 commenced within 20 years after the date on which the
15 prostitution or solicitation for prostitution in violation of NRS
16 201.354 occurred.
17 Sec. 1.4. NRS 11.190 is hereby amended to read as follows:
18 11.190 Except as otherwise provided in NRS 40.4639,
19 125B.050 and 217.007, actions other than those for the recovery of
20 real property, unless further limited by specific statute, may only be
21 commenced as follows:
22 1. Within 6 years:
23 (a) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 62B.420 and 176.275,

37 against a person alleged to have committed a deceptive trade
38 practice in violation of NRS 598.0903 to 598.0999, inclusive, but

5 constituting the waste or trespass.
6 (c) An action for taking, detaining or injuring personal property,
7 including actions for specific recovery thereof, but in all cases

10 at the time of its loss, and which strays or is stolen from the true
11 owner without the owner’s fault, the statute does not begin to run

14 upon inquiry as to the possession thereof by the defendant.

24 financial institution or other lender of the facts constituting the
25 concealment or false statement.
26 (f) An action pursuant to NRS 41.1335, but the cause of action
27 shall be deemed to accrue upon the discovery by the aggrieved party

31 200.975, whichever occurs later.
32 4. Within 2 years:
