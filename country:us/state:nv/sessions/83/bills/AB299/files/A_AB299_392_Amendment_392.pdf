EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to crimes; increasing the penalties for a customer who unlawfully
engages in prostitution or solicitation therefor; requiring a peace officer
to make an arrest with or without a warrant under certain
circumstances; revising requirements for the automatic sealing of
records in certain circumstances; revising provisions relating to
certain civil actions involving prostitution and solicitation for
prostitution; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits a customer from engaging in prostitution or solicitation for
2 prostitution except in a licensed house of prostitution. Existing law provides that a customer
3 who violates such a prohibition: (1) for a first offense that involves an adult, is guilty of a
4 misdemeanor, punishable by imprisonment in the county jail for not more than 6 months and
5 by a fine of not less than $400 but not more than $1,000; (2) for a subsequent offense that
6 involves an adult, is guilty of a gross misdemeanor, punishable by imprisonment in the county
7 jail for not more than 364 days and by certain minimum fines; and (3) for any offense, is
8 subject to a civil penalty of not less than $200 per offense. Additionally, existing law provides
9 for the automatic sealing of records if a person is discharged and the proceedings against the
10 person are dismissed upon the fulfillment of the terms and conditions of a court-ordered
11 program for the treatment of persons who solicit prostitution. (NRS 201.354)
12 [This] Section 1 of this bill: (1) requires a peace officer to arrest a person if the peace
13 officer has probable cause to believe that the person has violated such a prohibition; (2)
14 increases the minimum fine for a first offense to not less than $800; (3) increases the civil
15 penalty for any offense to $600; and (4) authorizes a person to petition the court 2 years after
16 the person is discharged and the proceedings against the person are dismissed for the sealing
17 of all records relating to the discharge and dismissal.
18 Existing law generally provides that when a person suffers an injury as the
19 proximate result of a wrongful act, the person who caused the injury is liable to the
20 person injured for damages. (NRS 41.130) In general, existing law requires a civil action
21 to recover damages for injuries arising from the wrongful act of another person to be

Assembly Amendment No. 392 to Assembly Bill No. 299 Page 4
22 commenced within 2 years after the date on which the wrongful act occurred. (NRS
23 11.190) Existing law exempts certain civil actions from this requirement, including a civil
24 action to recover damages for sexual exploitation, if the sexual exploitation occurred
25 when the plaintiff was less than 18 years of age. For purposes of this exemption, existing
26 law defines sexual exploitation to include forcing, allowing or encouraging a child to
27 solicit for or engage in prostitution. Therefore, under existing law, a civil action to
28 recover damages for prostitution or solicitation for prostitution may be commenced at
29 any time, if the prostitution or solicitation for prostitution occurred when the plaintiff
30 was less than 18 years of age. (NRS 11.215, 432B.110)
31 Section 1.6 of this bill specifically authorizes a person who has suffered an injury as
32 the proximate result of unlawful prostitution or solicitation for prostitution to bring a
33 civil action to recover damages for injuries arising from the prostitution or solicitation
34 for prostitution against the person convicted of the offense. Section 1.4 of this bill
35 exempts a civil action brought pursuant to section 1.2 from the generally applicable 2-
36 year statute of limitations prescribed by existing law. Section 1.2 of this bill provides that
37 a civil action brought pursuant to section 1.6 must be commenced within 20 years after
38 the date on which the violation occurred, unless an exception applies. Section 1.4
39 exempts a civil action to recover damages for injuries arising from unlawful prostitution
40 or solicitation for prostitution from the 20-year statute of limitations prescribed by
41 section 1.2 if the prostitution or solicitation for prostitution occurred when the plaintiff
42 was less than 18 years of age. Consistent with existing law, any such civil action may be
43 commenced at any time. (NRS 11.215, 432B.110)
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 201.354 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 201.354 1. It is unlawful for a customer to engage in prostitution or
3 solicitation therefor, except in a licensed house of prostitution. Whether or not a
4 warrant has been issued, a peace officer shall arrest a person if the peace officer
5 has probable cause to believe that the person to be arrested has violated this
6 section.
7 2. Any person who violates subsection 1 by soliciting for prostitution:
8 (a) A child;
9 (b) A peace officer who is posing as a child; or
10 (c) A person who is assisting in an investigation on behalf of a peace officer by
11 posing as a child,
12  is guilty of soliciting a child for prostitution.
13 3. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 5, a person who violates this
14 section:
15 (a) For a first offense, is guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punished as
16 provided in NRS 193.150, and by a fine of not less than [$400.] $800.
17 (b) For a second offense, is guilty of a gross misdemeanor and shall be
18 punished as provided in NRS 193.140, and by a fine of not less than $800.
19 (c) For a third or subsequent offense, is guilty of a gross misdemeanor and
20 shall be punished as provided in NRS 193.140, and by a fine of not less than
21 $1,300.
22 4. In addition to any other penalty imposed, the court shall order a person who
23 violates subsection 1 to pay a civil penalty of not less than [$200] $600 per offense.
24 The civil penalty must be paid to the district attorney or city attorney of the
25 jurisdiction in which the violation occurred. If the civil penalty imposed pursuant to
26 this subsection:

Assembly Amendment No. 392 to Assembly Bill No. 299 Page 5
1 (a) Is not within the person’s present ability to pay, in lieu of paying the
2 penalty, the court may allow the person to perform community service for a
3 reasonable number of hours, the value of which would be commensurate with the
4 civil penalty.
5 (b) Is not entirely within the person’s present ability to pay, in lieu of paying
6 the entire civil penalty, the court may allow the person to perform community
7 service for a reasonable number of hours, the value of which would be
8 commensurate with the amount of the reduction of the civil penalty.
9 5. A person who violates this section by soliciting a child for prostitution:
10 (a) For a first offense, is guilty of a category D felony and shall be punished as
11 provided in NRS 193.130, and by a fine of not more than $5,000.
12 (b) For a second offense, is guilty of a category C felony and shall be punished
13 as provided in NRS 193.130.
14 (c) For a third or subsequent offense, is guilty of a category B felony and shall
15 be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for a minimum term of not less
16 than 1 year and maximum term of not more than 6 years, and may be further
17 punished by a fine of not more than $15,000. The court shall not grant probation to
18 or suspend the sentence of a person punished pursuant to this paragraph.
19 6. Any civil penalty collected by a district attorney or city attorney pursuant
20 to subsection 4 must be deposited in the county or city treasury, as applicable, to be
21 used for:
22 (a) The enforcement of this section; and
23 (b) Programs of treatment for persons who solicit prostitution which are
24 certified by the Division of Public and Behavioral Health of the Department of
25 Health and Human Services.
26  Not less than 50 percent of the money deposited in the county or city treasury, as
27 applicable, pursuant to this subsection must be used for the enforcement of this
28 section.
29 7. If a person who violates subsection 1 is ordered pursuant to NRS 4.373 or
30 5.055 to participate in a program for the treatment of persons who solicit
31 prostitution, upon fulfillment of the terms and conditions of the program, the court
32 may discharge the person and dismiss the proceedings against the person. If the
33 court discharges the person and dismisses the proceedings against the person, a
34 nonpublic record of the discharge and dismissal must be transmitted to and retained
35 by the Division of Parole and Probation of the Department of Public Safety solely
36 for the use of the courts in determining whether, in later proceedings, the person
37 qualifies under this section for participation in a program of treatment for persons
38 who solicit prostitution. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, discharge
39 and dismissal under this subsection is without adjudication of guilt and is not a
40 conviction for purposes of employment, civil rights or any statute or regulation or
41 license or questionnaire or for any other public or private purpose, but is a
42 conviction for the purpose of additional penalties imposed for a second or
43 subsequent conviction or the setting of bail. Discharge and dismissal restores the
44 person discharged, in the contemplation of the law, to the status occupied before the
45 proceedings. The person may not be held thereafter under any law to be guilty of
46 perjury or otherwise giving a false statement by reason of failure to recite or
47 acknowledge the proceedings in response to an inquiry made of the person for any
48 purpose. Discharge and dismissal under this subsection may occur only once with
49 respect to any person. A professional licensing board may consider a proceeding
50 under this subsection in determining suitability for a license or liability to discipline
51 for misconduct. Such a board is entitled for those purposes to a truthful answer
52 from the applicant or licensee concerning any such proceeding with respect to the
53 applicant or licensee.

Assembly Amendment No. 392 to Assembly Bill No. 299 Page 6
1 8. Except as limited by subsection 9, if a person is discharged and the
2 proceedings against the person are dismissed pursuant to subsection 7, the [court
3 shall, without a hearing,] person may petition the court for the sealing of all
4 records relating to the discharge and dismissal 2 years after the date of the
5 dismissal. The court may order sealed all documents, papers and exhibits in that
6 person’s record, minute book entries and entries on dockets, and other documents
7 relating to the case in the custody of such other agencies and officers as are named
8 in the court’s order. The court shall cause a copy of the order to be sent to each
9 agency or officer named in the order. Each such agency or officer shall notify the
10 court in writing of its compliance with the order.
11 9. A professional licensing board is entitled, for the purpose of determining
12 suitability for a license or liability to discipline for misconduct, to inspect and to
13 copy from a record sealed pursuant to this section.
14 Sec. 1.2. Chapter 11 of NRS is hereby amended by adding thereto a new
15 section to read as follows:
16 Except as otherwise provided in NRS 11.215, an action to recover damages
17 pursuant to section 1.6 of this act must be commenced within 20 years after the
18 date on which the prostitution or solicitation for prostitution in violation of NRS
19 201.354 occurred.
20 Sec. 1.4. NRS 11.190 is hereby amended to read as follows:
21 11.190 Except as otherwise provided in NRS 40.4639, 125B.050 and
22 217.007, actions other than those for the recovery of real property, unless further
23 limited by specific statute, may only be commenced as follows:

49 (c) An action for taking, detaining or injuring personal property, including
50 actions for specific recovery thereof, but in all cases where the subject of the action
51 is a domestic animal usually included in the term “livestock,” which has a recorded
52 mark or brand upon it at the time of its loss, and which strays or is stolen from the
53 true owner without the owner’s fault, the statute does not begin to run against an

Assembly Amendment No. 392 to Assembly Bill No. 299 Page 7
