Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the formation of the Nevada Interscholastic Activities
2 Association to control, supervise and regulate all interscholastic athletic events and
3 other interscholastic events in public schools in this State. (NRS 385B.050) Under
4 existing law, the Association is required to adopt rules and regulations as is
5 necessary to govern such interscholastic activities and events. (NRS 385B.060)
6 Section 2 of this bill requires the Association to adopt regulations that: (1) set forth
7 the process for the Association to designate a sanctioned sport; (2) set forth
8 standards for determining, without limitation, the rules governing such sanctioned
9 sports; and (3) prioritize the designation of club sports as a sanctioned sport.
10 Section 2 additionally requires such regulations to be published on the Internet
11 website maintained by the Association. Section 5 of this bill requires the

12 Association to adopt such regulations not later than October 1, 2025. If such
13 regulations are not adopted on or before October 1, 2025, section 2 transfers the
14 authority to adopt such regulations to the Nevada Association of School
15 Superintendents.
16 Under section 2, such regulations must authorize a person to submit a request
17 for the Association to designate a sanctioned sport and require the Association to
18 approve or deny the request for designation of the sanctioned sport not later than 1
19 year after the Association receives the request. If the Association fails to act on
20 such a request and adopt any necessary regulations within 1 year after the
21 Association receives the request, section 2 transfers the authority to act on such a
22 request and adopt any necessary regulations to the Nevada Association of School
23 Superintendents.
24 Section 5.3 of this bill requires the Nevada Interscholastic Activities
25 Association to adopt: (1) regulations designating lacrosse as a sanctioned sport for
26 boys and as a sanctioned sport for girls beginning with the 2026-2027 school year;
27 and (2) the rules and regulations necessary to allow pupils to participate in lacrosse
28 as a sanctioned sport beginning with the 2026-2027 school year. Under section 2, if
29 the Nevada Interscholastic Activities Association does not adopt such rules and
30 regulations, the authority to adopt such rules and regulations transfers to the
31 Nevada Association of School Superintendents and lacrosse must be conducted as a
32 sanctioned sport under the rules prescribed by the Nevada Association of School
33 Superintendents until such time as the Nevada Interscholastic Activities
34 Association adopts regulations to amend such rules. Finally, section 5.3 requires
35 the Nevada Interscholastic Activities Association to provide to the Joint Interim
36 Standing Committee on Education quarterly reports of the progress of the Nevada
37 Interscholastic Activities Association in implementing lacrosse as a sanctioned
38 sport.
39 Section 5.7 of this bill requires the Joint Interim Standing Committee on
40 Education to conduct an interim study of the Nevada Interscholastic Activities
41 Association during the 2025-2026 interim.
