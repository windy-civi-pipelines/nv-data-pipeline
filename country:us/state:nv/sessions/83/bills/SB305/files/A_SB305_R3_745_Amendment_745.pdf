AN ACT relating to interscholastic activities; requiring the Nevada Interscholastic
Activities Association to adopt regulations that set forth the process for
the Association to designate a sanctioned sport; providing certain
requirements for such regulations; requiring the Association to publish
such regulations on the Internet website maintained by the Association;
providing for the designation of lacrosse as a sanctioned sport;
[requiring] establishing the Subcommittee on Interscholastic
Activities of the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Education ;
requiring the Subcommittee to conduct an interim study of the
Association; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the formation of the Nevada Interscholastic Activities
2 Association to control, supervise and regulate all interscholastic athletic events and other
3 interscholastic events in public schools in this State. (NRS 385B.050) Under existing law, the
4 Association is required to adopt rules and regulations as is necessary to govern such
5 interscholastic activities and events. (NRS 385B.060) Section 2 of this bill requires the
6 Association to adopt regulations that: (1) set forth the process for the Association to designate
7 a sanctioned sport; (2) set forth standards for determining, without limitation, the rules
8 governing such sanctioned sports; and (3) prioritize the designation of club sports as a
9 sanctioned sport. Section 2 additionally requires such regulations to be published on the
10 Internet website maintained by the Association. Section 5 of this bill requires the Association
11 to adopt such regulations not later than October 1, 2025. If such regulations are not adopted on
12 or before October 1, 2025, section 2 transfers the authority to adopt such regulations to the
13 Nevada Association of School Superintendents. Finally, section 2 provides that a school
14 that is a member of the Nevada Interscholastic Activities Association is not required to
15 take certain actions, including, without limitation, establishing an athletic program, for
16 any sport that is sanctioned as a result of such regulations.

Assembly Amendment No. 745 to Senate Bill No. 305 Third Reprint Page 4
17 Under section 2, such regulations must authorize a person to submit a request for the
18 Association to designate a sanctioned sport and require the Association to approve or deny the
19 request for designation of the sanctioned sport not later than 1 year after the Association
20 receives the request. If the Association fails to act on such a request and adopt any necessary
21 regulations within 1 year after the Association receives the request, section 2 transfers the
22 authority to act on such a request and adopt any necessary regulations to the Nevada
23 Association of School Superintendents.
24 Existing law establishes the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Education and
25 prescribes the duties of the Committee. (NRS 218E.320, 218E.330, 218E.615) Section 2.3
26 of this bill: (1) establishes the Subcommittee on Interscholastic Activities of the Joint
27 Interim Standing Committee on Education; and (2) sets forth the membership of the
28 Subcommittee. Section 2.5 of this bill sets forth requirements governing: (1) meetings of
29 the Subcommittee; and (2) compensation and pier diem allowance and travel expenses
30 for members of the Subcommittee. Finally, section 2.7 of this bill authorizes the
31 Subcommittee to, without limitation: (1) review and comment on any action, activity or
32 administrative policy, rule or regulation of the Nevada Interscholastic Activities
33 Association; (2) conduct related investigations and hold hearings; and (3) review
34 interscholastic activities and events and competitions in this State to ensure compliance
35 with certain federal laws.
36 Section 5.3 of this bill requires the Nevada Interscholastic Activities Association to
37 adopt: (1) regulations designating lacrosse as a sanctioned sport for boys and as a sanctioned
38 sport for girls beginning with the 2026-2027 school year; and (2) the rules and regulations
39 necessary to allow pupils to participate in lacrosse as a sanctioned sport beginning with the
40 2026-2027 school year. Under section 2, if the Nevada Interscholastic Activities Association
41 does not adopt such rules and regulations [,] : (1) the authority to adopt such rules and
42 regulations transfers to the Nevada Association of School Superintendents [and] ; (2) lacrosse
43 must be conducted as a sanctioned sport under the rules prescribed by the Nevada Association
44 of School Superintendents until such time as the Nevada Interscholastic Activities Association
45 adopts regulations to amend such rules [.] ; and (3) the Nevada Interscholastic Activities
46 Association is required to transfer a payment in the amount of $25,000 to the Nevada
47 Association of School Superintendents to defray costs associated with adopting such
48 regulations. Finally, section 5.3 requires the Nevada Interscholastic Activities Association to
49 provide to the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Education quarterly reports of the
50 progress of the Nevada Interscholastic Activities Association in implementing lacrosse as a
51 sanctioned sport.
52 Section 5.7 of this bill requires the Subcommittee on Interscholastic Activities of the
53 Joint Interim Standing Committee on Education to conduct an interim study of the Nevada
54 Interscholastic Activities Association during the 2025-2026 interim.
