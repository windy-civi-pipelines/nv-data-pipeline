EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to interscholastic activities; requiring the Nevada
Interscholastic Activities Association to adopt regulations
that set forth the process for the Association to designate a
sanctioned sport; providing certain requirements for such
regulations; requiring the Association to publish such
regulations on the Internet website maintained by the
Association; providing for the designation of lacrosse as a
sanctioned sport; establishing the Subcommittee on
Interscholastic Activities of the Joint Interim Standing
Committee on Education; requiring the Subcommittee to
conduct an interim study of the Association; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the formation of the Nevada Interscholastic Activities
2 Association to control, supervise and regulate all interscholastic athletic events and
3 other interscholastic events in public schools in this State. (NRS 385B.050) Under
4 existing law, the Association is required to adopt rules and regulations as is
5 necessary to govern such interscholastic activities and events. (NRS 385B.060)
6 Section 2 of this bill requires the Association to adopt regulations that: (1) set forth
7 the process for the Association to designate a sanctioned sport; (2) set forth
8 standards for determining, without limitation, the rules governing such sanctioned
9 sports; and (3) prioritize the designation of club sports as a sanctioned sport.

10 Section 2 additionally requires such regulations to be published on the Internet
11 website maintained by the Association. Section 5 of this bill requires the
12 Association to adopt such regulations not later than October 1, 2025. If such
13 regulations are not adopted on or before October 1, 2025, section 2 transfers the
14 authority to adopt such regulations to the Nevada Association of School
15 Superintendents. Finally, section 2 provides that a school that is a member of the
16 Nevada Interscholastic Activities Association is not required to take certain actions,
17 including, without limitation, establishing an athletic program, for any sport that is
18 sanctioned as a result of such regulations.
19 Under section 2, such regulations must authorize a person to submit a request
20 for the Association to designate a sanctioned sport and require the Association to
21 approve or deny the request for designation of the sanctioned sport not later than 1
22 year after the Association receives the request. If the Association fails to act on
23 such a request and adopt any necessary regulations within 1 year after the
24 Association receives the request, section 2 transfers the authority to act on such a
25 request and adopt any necessary regulations to the Nevada Association of School
26 Superintendents.
27 Existing law establishes the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Education
28 and prescribes the duties of the Committee. (NRS 218E.320, 218E.330, 218E.615)
29 Section 2.3 of this bill: (1) establishes the Subcommittee on Interscholastic
30 Activities of the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Education; and (2) sets forth
31 the membership of the Subcommittee. Section 2.5 of this bill sets forth
32 requirements governing: (1) meetings of the Subcommittee; and (2) compensation
33 and pier diem allowance and travel expenses for members of the Subcommittee.
34 Finally, section 2.7 of this bill authorizes the Subcommittee to, without limitation:
35 (1) review and comment on any action, activity or administrative policy, rule or
36 regulation of the Nevada Interscholastic Activities Association; (2) conduct related
37 investigations and hold hearings; and (3) review interscholastic activities and
38 events and competitions in this State to ensure compliance with certain federal
39 laws.
40 Section 5.3 of this bill requires the Nevada Interscholastic Activities
41 Association to adopt: (1) regulations designating lacrosse as a sanctioned sport for
42 boys and as a sanctioned sport for girls beginning with the 2026-2027 school year;
43 and (2) the rules and regulations necessary to allow pupils to participate in lacrosse
44 as a sanctioned sport beginning with the 2026-2027 school year. Under section 2, if
45 the Nevada Interscholastic Activities Association does not adopt such rules and
46 regulations: (1) the authority to adopt such rules and regulations transfers to the
47 Nevada Association of School Superintendents; (2) lacrosse must be conducted as a
48 sanctioned sport under the rules prescribed by the Nevada Association of School
49 Superintendents until such time as the Nevada Interscholastic Activities
50 Association adopts regulations to amend such rules; and (3) the Nevada
51 Interscholastic Activities Association is required to transfer a payment in the
52 amount of $25,000 to the Nevada Association of School Superintendents to defray
53 costs associated with adopting such regulations. Finally, section 5.3 requires the
54 Nevada Interscholastic Activities Association to provide to the Joint Interim
55 Standing Committee on Education quarterly reports of the progress of the Nevada
56 Interscholastic Activities Association in implementing lacrosse as a sanctioned
57 sport.
58 Section 5.7 of this bill requires the Subcommittee on Interscholastic Activities
59 of the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Education to conduct an interim study
60 of the Nevada Interscholastic Activities Association during the 2025-2026 interim.

2 Association to control, supervise and regulate all interscholastic athletic events and
3 other interscholastic events in public schools in this State. (NRS 385B.050) Under
4 existing law, the Association is required to adopt rules and regulations as is

8 standards for determining, without limitation, the rules governing such sanctioned
9 sports; and (3) prioritize the designation of club sports as a sanctioned sport.

10 Section 2 additionally requires such regulations to be published on the Internet
11 website maintained by the Association. Section 5 of this bill requires the
12 Association to adopt such regulations not later than October 1, 2025. If such
13 regulations are not adopted on or before October 1, 2025, section 2 transfers the
14 authority to adopt such regulations to the Nevada Association of School
15 Superintendents. Finally, section 2 provides that a school that is a member of the
16 Nevada Interscholastic Activities Association is not required to take certain actions,
17 including, without limitation, establishing an athletic program, for any sport that is

19 Under section 2, such regulations must authorize a person to submit a request
20 for the Association to designate a sanctioned sport and require the Association to
21 approve or deny the request for designation of the sanctioned sport not later than 1
22 year after the Association receives the request. If the Association fails to act on

24 Association receives the request, section 2 transfers the authority to act on such a
25 request and adopt any necessary regulations to the Nevada Association of School
26 Superintendents.
27 Existing law establishes the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Education
28 and prescribes the duties of the Committee. (NRS 218E.320, 218E.330, 218E.615)
29 Section 2.3 of this bill: (1) establishes the Subcommittee on Interscholastic
30 Activities of the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Education; and (2) sets forth
31 the membership of the Subcommittee. Section 2.5 of this bill sets forth

39 laws.
40 Section 5.3 of this bill requires the Nevada Interscholastic Activities
41 Association to adopt: (1) regulations designating lacrosse as a sanctioned sport for
42 boys and as a sanctioned sport for girls beginning with the 2026-2027 school year;
43 and (2) the rules and regulations necessary to allow pupils to participate in lacrosse

46 regulations: (1) the authority to adopt such rules and regulations transfers to the
47 Nevada Association of School Superintendents; (2) lacrosse must be conducted as a
