Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the formation of the Nevada Interscholastic Activities
2 Association to control, supervise and regulate all interscholastic athletic events and other
3 interscholastic events in public schools in this State. (NRS 385B.050) Under existing law, the
4 Association is required to adopt rules and regulations as is necessary to govern such

7 a sanctioned sport; (2) set forth standards for determining, without limitation, the rules
8 governing such sanctioned sports; and (3) prioritize the designation of club sports as a
9 sanctioned sport. Section 2 additionally requires such regulations to be published on the
10 Internet website maintained by the Association. Section 5 of this bill requires the Association
11 to adopt such regulations not later than October 1, 2025. If such regulations are not adopted
12 on or before October 1, 2025, section 2 transfers the authority to adopt such regulations
13 to the Nevada Association of School Superintendents.
14 Under section 2, such regulations must authorize a person to submit a request for
15 the Association to designate a sanctioned sport and require the Association to approve or
16 deny the request for designation of the sanctioned sport not later than 1 year after the
17 Association receives the request. If the Association fails to act on such a request and
18 adopt any necessary regulations within 1 year after the Association receives the request,

19 section 2 transfers the authority to act on such a request and adopt any necessary
20 regulations to the Nevada Association of School Superintendents.

24 and regulations necessary to allow pupils to participate in lacrosse as a sanctioned sport
25 beginning with the 2026-2027 school year. Under section 2, if the Nevada Interscholastic
26 Activities Association does not adopt such rules and regulations, the authority to adopt
27 such rules and regulations transfers to the Nevada Association of School
28 Superintendents and lacrosse must be conducted as a sanctioned sport under the rules
29 prescribed by the Nevada Association of School Superintendents until such time as the
30 Nevada Interscholastic Activities Association adopts regulations to amend such rules.
31 Finally, section 5.3 requires the Nevada Interscholastic Activities Association to provide

33 of the Nevada Interscholastic Activities Association in implementing lacrosse as a
34 sanctioned sport.
