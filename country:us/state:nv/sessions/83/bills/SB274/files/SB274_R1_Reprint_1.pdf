EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to governmental administration; revising the
manner in which the Chair and Vice Chair of the Sunset
Subcommittee of the Legislative Commission are
selected; revising reporting requirements by certain
licensing boards and other regulatory bodies concerning
the criminal histories of certain applicants; repealing the
requirement that the Sunset Subcommittee review certain
licensing boards and other regulatory bodies regarding
restrictions on the criminal histories of certain applicants;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates the Sunset Subcommittee of the Legislative
2 Commission and requires the Sunset Subcommittee to conduct a review of certain
3 boards and commissions in this State. Under existing law, the Chair and Vice Chair
4 of the Sunset Subcommittee are elected by the voting members of the Sunset
5 Subcommittee. (NRS 232B.210, 232B.220) Section 2 of this bill instead requires
6 that the Chair and Vice Chair of the Sunset Subcommittee be appointed by the
7 Chair of the Legislative Commission.
8 Existing law requires certain professional or occupational licensing boards and
9 other regulatory bodies to submit to the Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau
10 quarterly reports concerning petitions for the review of criminal histories of
11 potential applicants, which would disqualify such applicants from obtaining a
12 license from the professional or occupational licensing board or regulatory body, as
13 applicable. (NRS 622.085, 622.100) Section 3 of this bill removes this requirement.

14 Existing law requires the Sunset Subcommittee to conduct a review of certain
15 professional or occupational licensing boards and other regulatory bodies in this
16 State to determine whether the restrictions on the criminal history of an applicant
17 for an occupational or professional license are appropriate. (NRS 232B.237)
18 Section 4 of this bill repeals this requirement.
