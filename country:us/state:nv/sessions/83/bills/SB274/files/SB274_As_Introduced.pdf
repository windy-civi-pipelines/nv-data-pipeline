Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes provisions relating to appointments made by the
2 Governor to boards, commissions or similar bodies. (NRS 232A.010-232A.030)
3 Section 1 of this bill requires boards, commissions and similar bodies to submit to
4 the Governor a list of persons qualified for membership on such a board,
5 commission or similar body within 60 days after a vacancy occurs.
6 Existing law creates the Sunset Subcommittee of the Legislative Commission
7 and requires the Sunset Subcommittee to conduct a review of certain boards and
8 commissions in this State. Under existing law, the Chair and Vice Chair of the
9 Sunset Subcommittee are elected by the voting members of the Sunset
10 Subcommittee. (NRS 232B.210, 232B.220) Section 2 of this bill instead requires

– 2 –
11 that the Chair and Vice Chair of the Sunset Subcommittee be appointed by the
12 Chair of the Legislative Commission.
13 Existing law requires certain professional or occupational licensing boards and
14 other regulatory bodies to submit to the Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau
15 quarterly reports concerning petitions for the review of criminal histories of
16 potential applicants, which would disqualify such applicants from obtaining a
17 license from the professional or occupational licensing board or regulatory body, as
18 applicable. (NRS 622.085, 622.100) Section 3 of this bill removes this requirement.
19 Existing law requires the Sunset Subcommittee to conduct a review of certain
20 professional or occupational licensing boards and other regulatory bodies in this
21 State to determine whether the restrictions on the criminal history of an applicant
22 for an occupational or professional license are appropriate. (NRS 232B.237)
23 Section 4 of this bill repeals this requirement.
