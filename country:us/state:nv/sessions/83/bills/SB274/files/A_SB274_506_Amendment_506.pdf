EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to governmental administration; [requiring certain public bodies
to submit a list of qualified persons to the Governor to fill vacancies on
a board, commission or similar body within 60 days after the vacancy
occurs;] revising the manner in which the Chair and Vice Chair of the
Sunset Subcommittee of the Legislative Commission are selected;
revising reporting requirements by certain licensing boards and other
regulatory bodies concerning the criminal histories of certain
applicants; repealing the requirement that the Sunset Subcommittee
review certain licensing boards and other regulatory bodies regarding
restrictions on the criminal histories of certain applicants; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 [Existing law establishes provisions relating to appointments made by the Governor to
2 boards, commissions or similar bodies. (NRS 232A.010-232A.030) Section 1 of this bill
3 requires boards, commissions and similar bodies to submit to the Governor a list of persons
4 qualified for membership on such a board, commission or similar body within 60 days after a
5 vacancy occurs.]
6 Existing law creates the Sunset Subcommittee of the Legislative Commission and
7 requires the Sunset Subcommittee to conduct a review of certain boards and commissions in
8 this State. Under existing law, the Chair and Vice Chair of the Sunset Subcommittee are
9 elected by the voting members of the Sunset Subcommittee. (NRS 232B.210, 232B.220)
10 Section 2 of this bill instead requires that the Chair and Vice Chair of the Sunset
11 Subcommittee be appointed by the Chair of the Legislative Commission.
12 Existing law requires certain professional or occupational licensing boards and other
13 regulatory bodies to submit to the Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau quarterly reports
14 concerning petitions for the review of criminal histories of potential applicants, which would
15 disqualify such applicants from obtaining a license from the professional or occupational
16 licensing board or regulatory body, as applicable. (NRS 622.085, 622.100) Section 3 of this
17 bill removes this requirement.

Senate Amendment No. 506 to Senate Bill No. 274 Page 4
18 Existing law requires the Sunset Subcommittee to conduct a review of certain
19 professional or occupational licensing boards and other regulatory bodies in this State to
20 determine whether the restrictions on the criminal history of an applicant for an occupational
21 or professional license are appropriate. (NRS 232B.237) Section 4 of this bill repeals this
22 requirement.
