2 provides for additional licenses, known as tags, to hunt, trap or fish designated
3 species of wildlife. (NRS 502.130) Under existing law, whenever tags are required
4 for any species of wildlife, it is unlawful to possess any of that species without the
5 correct tag. (NRS 502.150) Section 3 of this bill authorizes a person, for non-

7 head, with or without antlers or horns attached, or bones from the carcass of any
8 wildlife species for which a tag is required under certain circumstances.
