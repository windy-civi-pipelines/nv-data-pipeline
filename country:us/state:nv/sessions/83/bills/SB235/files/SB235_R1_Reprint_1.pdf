EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to wildlife; authorizing under certain
circumstances a person to gather shed antlers or a skull,
head or bones of a wildlife species without a tag for non-
commercial purposes; revising the authority of the Board
of Wildlife Commissioners to adopt regulations relating
to shed antlers; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 In addition to regular licenses or permits to hunt, fish or trap, existing law
2 provides for additional licenses, known as tags, to hunt, trap or fish designated
3 species of wildlife. (NRS 502.130) Under existing law, whenever tags are required
4 for any species of wildlife, it is unlawful to possess any of that species without the
5 correct tag. (NRS 502.150) Section 3 of this bill authorizes a person, for non-
6 commercial purposes and without the required tag, to gather shed antlers or a skull
7 or head, with or without antlers or horns attached, or bones from the carcass of any
8 wildlife species for which a tag is required under certain circumstances.
9 Existing law requires the Board of Wildlife Commissioners to adopt regulations
10 for the taking of antlers which have been naturally shed by any big game mammal
11 in this State. (NRS 503.655) Section 4 of this bill instead requires the Commission
12 to adopt regulations for the gathering of shed antlers which must only apply to the
13 gathering of shed antlers for commercial purposes.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN

1 Sec. 3. NRS 502.150 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 502.150 1. [Whenever] Except as otherwise provided in
3 subsection 4, whenever tags are required for any species of wildlife,
4 it is unlawful to have any of that species in possession without the
5 correct tag. Before transporting any species of wildlife, or parts
6 thereof, for which a tag is required, the holder of:
7 (a) A paper tag must attach the tag to the animal; or
8 (b) An electronic tag must validate the tag in accordance with
9 the regulations adopted by the Commission pursuant to
10 NRS 502.160.
11  Possession of any species of wildlife, or parts thereof, for which a
12 tag is required without an attached or validated tag, as applicable, is
13 prima facie evidence that the game is illegally taken and possessed.
14 2. It is unlawful to remove any tag from any wildlife for reuse
15 or to be in possession of excess tags or used tags.
16 3. Whenever tags are required for any species of fur-bearing
17 mammal, possession of a pelt of that species without the tag
18 attached thereto or validated, as applicable, is prima facie evidence
19 that such pelt is illegally taken and possessed.
20 4. A person may, for non-commercial purposes and without
21 obtaining the required tag, gather shed antlers or a skull or head,
22 with or without antlers or horns attached, or bones from the
23 carcass of any species of wildlife for which a tag is required if
24 such a part of the carcass is exposed, dry bone resulting from
25 natural processes, including, without limitation, scavenging,
26 decomposition or weathering.
27 Sec. 4. NRS 503.655 is hereby amended to read as follows:
28 503.655 1. The Commission shall adopt regulations for the
29 [taking] gathering of shed antlers. The regulations adopted by the
30 Commission pursuant to this section must only apply to the
31 gathering of shed antlers for commercial purposes.
32 2. As used in this section, “shed antlers” means antlers which
33 have been naturally shed by any big game mammal in this State.
