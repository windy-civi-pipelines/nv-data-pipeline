provides for additional licenses, known as tags, to hunt, trap or fish designated
species of wildlife. (NRS 502.130) Under existing law, whenever tags are required
for any species of wildlife, it is unlawful to possess any of that species without the
correct tag. (NRS 502.150) Section 3 of this bill authorizes a person, for non-
commercial purposes and without the required tag, to take shed antlers or a skull or
head, with or without antlers or horns attached, or bones from the carcass of any
wildlife species for which a tag is required under certain circumstances.
