EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to wildlife; authorizing under certain circumstances a person to
[gather] take shed antlers or a skull, head or bones of a wildlife species
without a tag for non-commercial purposes; [revising the authority of
the Board of Wildlife Commissioners to adopt regulations relating to
shed antlers;] and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 In addition to regular licenses or permits to hunt, fish or trap, existing law provides for
2 additional licenses, known as tags, to hunt, trap or fish designated species of wildlife. (NRS
3 502.130) Under existing law, whenever tags are required for any species of wildlife, it is
4 unlawful to possess any of that species without the correct tag. (NRS 502.150) Section 3 of
5 this bill authorizes a person, for non-commercial purposes and without the required tag, to
6 [gather] take shed antlers or a skull or head, with or without antlers or horns attached, or
7 bones from the carcass of any wildlife species for which a tag is required under certain
8 circumstances.
9 [Existing law requires the Board of Wildlife Commissioners to adopt regulations for the
10 taking of antlers which have been naturally shed by any big game mammal in this State. (NRS
11 503.655) Section 4 of this bill instead requires the Commission to adopt regulations for the
12 gathering of shed antlers which must only apply to the gathering of shed antlers for
13 commercial purposes.]

4 502.150 1. [Whenever] Except as otherwise provided in subsection 4,

1 (b) An electronic tag must validate the tag in accordance with the regulations
2 adopted by the Commission pursuant to NRS 502.160.
3  Possession of any species of wildlife, or parts thereof, for which a tag is required
4 without an attached or validated tag, as applicable, is prima facie evidence that the
5 game is illegally taken and possessed.
6 2. It is unlawful to remove any tag from any wildlife for reuse or to be in
7 possession of excess tags or used tags.
8 3. Whenever tags are required for any species of fur-bearing mammal,
9 possession of a pelt of that species without the tag attached thereto or validated, as
10 applicable, is prima facie evidence that such pelt is illegally taken and possessed.
11 4. A person may, for non-commercial purposes and without obtaining the
12 required tag, [gather] take shed antlers or a skull or head, with or without antlers
13 or horns attached, or bones from the carcass of any species of wildlife for which
14 a tag is required if such a part of the carcass is exposed, dry bone resulting from
15 natural processes, including, without limitation, scavenging, decomposition or
16 weathering.
17 Sec. 4. [NRS 503.655 is hereby amended to read as follows:
18 503.655 1. The Commission shall adopt regulations for the [taking]
19 gathering of shed antlers. The regulations adopted by the Commission pursuant to
20 this section must only apply to the gathering of shed antlers for commercial
21 purposes.
22 2. As used in this section, “shed antlers” means antlers which have been
23 naturally shed by any big game mammal in this State.] (Deleted by amendment.)
