AN ACT relating to wildlife; [revising provisions governing the establishment of a
program which authorizes a person to transfer his or her tag to hunt a
big game mammal to any person who is under 18 years of age; revising
provisions relating to the exhibition or possession of certain licenses,
permits or related items while engaged in certain activities concerning
wildlife;] authorizing under certain circumstances a person to [take
or] gather shed antlers or a skull , [or] head or bones of a wildlife
species without a tag for non-commercial purposes; revising the
authority of the Board of Wildlife Commissioners to adopt
regulations relating to shed antlers; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 [Existing law authorizes the Board of Wildlife Commissioners to adopt regulations
2 establishing a program that allows a person to transfer his or her tag to hunt a big game
3 mammal to any person who is under 18 years of age. (NRS 502.102) Section 1 of this bill
4 makes the adoption of the regulations mandatory.
5 Under existing law, a person is guilty of a misdemeanor if the person: (1) is required to
6 have a license or permit to engage in activities regulated by the provisions relating to wildlife;
7 and (2) while engaged in any such activity, refuses, upon the demand of an officer authorized
8 to enforce the fish and game laws of this State, to exhibit the license or permit, any wildlife in
9 the person’s possession or any weapon, ammunition, device or apparatus in the person’s
10 possession that may be used for any such activity. (NRS 502.120) Under existing law, this
11 crime is punishable by: (1) a fine of not less than $50 nor more than $500; (2) imprisonment
12 in the county jail for not more than 6 months; or (3) both fine and imprisonment. (NRS
13 501.385) Section 2 of this bill eliminates the criminal penalty for refusing to exhibit any of the
14 items other than the license or permit.
15 Subject to the same criminal penalty, a person is also guilty of a misdemeanor under
16 existing law if the person: (1) is required to have a license or permit to engage in activities
17 regulated by the provisions relating to wildlife; and (2) while engaged in any such activity,
18 fails to have the license or permit in his or her possession. (NRS 502.120) Section 2 clarifies
19 that, for purposes of this crime, the license or permit may be possessed in physical or
20 electronic form.]
21 In addition to regular licenses or permits to hunt, fish or trap, existing law provides for
22 additional licenses, known as tags, to hunt, trap or fish designated species of wildlife. (NRS

Senate Amendment No. 328 to Senate Bill No. 235 Page 4
23 502.130) Under existing law, whenever tags are required for any species of wildlife, it is
24 unlawful to possess any of that species without the correct tag. (NRS 502.150) Section 3 of
25 this bill authorizes a person, for non-commercial purposes and without the required tag, to
26 [take or] gather shed antlers or a skull or head , with or without antlers or horns attached,
27 or bones from the carcass of any wildlife species for which a tag is required [, with or
28 without antlers or horns attached.] under certain circumstances.
29 Existing law requires the Board of Wildlife Commissioners to adopt regulations for
30 the taking of antlers which have been naturally shed by any big game mammal in this
31 State. (NRS 503.655) Section 4 of this bill instead requires the Commission to adopt
32 regulations for the gathering of shed antlers which must only apply to the gathering of
33 shed antlers for commercial purposes.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. [NRS 502.102 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 502.102 The Commission [may] shall adopt regulations establishing a
3 program which authorizes a person to transfer his or her tag to hunt a big game
4 mammal to any person who is under 18 years of age.] (Deleted by amendment.)
5 Sec. 2. [NRS 502.120 is hereby amended to read as follows:
6 502.120 1. Each person required to have a license or permit as provided in
7 this title who, while engaged in any activity regulated by this title, refuses to exhibit
8 the license or permit, [any wildlife which the person may have in his or her
9 possession, or any weapon, ammunition, device or apparatus in his or her
10 possession which may be used for any activity regulated by this title,] upon the
11 demand of any officer authorized to enforce the fish and game laws of this State, is
12 guilty of a misdemeanor.
13 2. Each person required to have a license or permit as provided in this chapter
14 who, while engaged in any activity regulated by this title, fails to have the license
15 or permit in his or her possession in physical or electronic form is guilty of a
16 misdemeanor. A person charged with violating this subsection may not be
17 convicted if the person produces in court in physical or electronic form a license or
18 permit previously issued to the person and valid at the time of his or her arrest.]
19 (Deleted by amendment.)
20 Sec. 3. NRS 502.150 is hereby amended to read as follows:
21 502.150 1. [Whenever] Except as otherwise provided in subsection 4,
22 whenever tags are required for any species of wildlife, it is unlawful to have any of
23 that species in possession without the correct tag. Before transporting any species
24 of wildlife, or parts thereof, for which a tag is required, the holder of:
25 (a) A paper tag must attach the tag to the animal; or
26 (b) An electronic tag must validate the tag in accordance with the regulations
27 adopted by the Commission pursuant to NRS 502.160.
28  Possession of any species of wildlife, or parts thereof, for which a tag is required
29 without an attached or validated tag, as applicable, is prima facie evidence that the
30 game is illegally taken and possessed.
31 2. It is unlawful to remove any tag from any wildlife for reuse or to be in
32 possession of excess tags or used tags.
33 3. Whenever tags are required for any species of fur-bearing mammal,
34 possession of a pelt of that species without the tag attached thereto or validated, as
35 applicable, is prima facie evidence that such pelt is illegally taken and possessed.
36 4. A person may, for non-commercial purposes and without obtaining the
37 required tag, [take or] gather shed antlers or a skull or head , with or without

1 antlers or horns attached, or bones from the carcass of any species of wildlife for
2 which a tag is required [, with or without antlers or horns attached.] if such a
3 part of the carcass is exposed, dry bone resulting from natural processes,
4 including, without limitation, scavenging, decomposition or weathering.
5 Sec. 4. NRS 503.655 is hereby amended to read as follows:
6 503.655 1. The Commission shall adopt regulations for the [taking]
7 gathering of shed antlers. The regulations adopted by the Commission pursuant to
8 this section must only apply to the gathering of shed antlers for commercial
9 purposes.
10 2. As used in this section, “shed antlers” means antlers which have been
11 naturally shed by any big game mammal in this State.
