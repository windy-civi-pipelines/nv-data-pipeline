AN ACT relating to wildlife; revising provisions governing the
establishment of a program which authorizes a person to
transfer his or her tag to hunt a big game mammal to any
person who is under 18 years of age; revising provisions
relating to the exhibition or possession of certain licenses,
permits or related items while engaged in certain activities
concerning wildlife; authorizing a person to take or gather
a skull or head of a wildlife species without a tag for non-

properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the Board of Wildlife Commissioners to adopt
2 regulations establishing a program that allows a person to transfer his or her tag to
3 hunt a big game mammal to any person who is under 18 years of age. (NRS
4 502.102) Section 1 of this bill makes the adoption of the regulations mandatory.
5 Under existing law, a person is guilty of a misdemeanor if the person: (1) is
6 required to have a license or permit to engage in activities regulated by the
7 provisions relating to wildlife; and (2) while engaged in any such activity, refuses,
8 upon the demand of an officer authorized to enforce the fish and game laws of this
9 State, to exhibit the license or permit, any wildlife in the person’s possession or any
10 weapon, ammunition, device or apparatus in the person’s possession that may be
11 used for any such activity. (NRS 502.120) Under existing law, this crime is
12 punishable by: (1) a fine of not less than $50 nor more than $500; (2) imprisonment
13 in the county jail for not more than 6 months; or (3) both fine and imprisonment.
14 (NRS 501.385) Section 2 of this bill eliminates the criminal penalty for refusing to
15 exhibit any of the items other than the license or permit.
16 Subject to the same criminal penalty, a person is also guilty of a misdemeanor
17 under existing law if the person: (1) is required to have a license or permit to
18 engage in activities regulated by the provisions relating to wildlife; and (2) while

19 engaged in any such activity, fails to have the license or permit in his or her
20 possession. (NRS 502.120) Section 2 clarifies that, for purposes of this crime, the
21 license or permit may be possessed in physical or electronic form.
22 In addition to regular licenses or permits to hunt, fish or trap, existing law
23 provides for additional licenses, known as tags, to hunt, trap or fish designated
24 species of wildlife. (NRS 502.130) Under existing law, whenever tags are required
25 for any species of wildlife, it is unlawful to possess any of that species without the
26 correct tag. (NRS 502.150) Section 3 of this bill authorizes a person, for non-
27 commercial purposes and without the required tag, to take or gather a skull or head
28 of any wildlife species for which a tag is required, with or without antlers or horns
29 attached.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 502.102 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 502.102 The Commission [may] shall adopt regulations
3 establishing a program which authorizes a person to transfer his or
4 her tag to hunt a big game mammal to any person who is under 18
5 years of age.
6 Sec. 2. NRS 502.120 is hereby amended to read as follows:
7 502.120 1. Each person required to have a license or permit
8 as provided in this title who, while engaged in any activity regulated
9 by this title, refuses to exhibit the license or permit, [any wildlife
10 which the person may have in his or her possession, or any weapon,
11 ammunition, device or apparatus in his or her possession which may
12 be used for any activity regulated by this title,] upon the demand of
13 any officer authorized to enforce the fish and game laws of this
14 State, is guilty of a misdemeanor.
15 2. Each person required to have a license or permit as provided
16 in this chapter who, while engaged in any activity regulated by this
17 title, fails to have the license or permit in his or her possession in
18 physical or electronic form is guilty of a misdemeanor. A person
19 charged with violating this subsection may not be convicted if the
20 person produces in court in physical or electronic form a license or
21 permit previously issued to the person and valid at the time of his or
22 her arrest.
23 Sec. 3. NRS 502.150 is hereby amended to read as follows:
24 502.150 1. [Whenever] Except as otherwise provided in
25 subsection 4, whenever tags are required for any species of wildlife,
26 it is unlawful to have any of that species in possession without the
27 correct tag. Before transporting any species of wildlife, or parts
28 thereof, for which a tag is required, the holder of:
29 (a) A paper tag must attach the tag to the animal; or

2 the regulations adopted by the Commission pursuant to
3 NRS 502.160.
4  Possession of any species of wildlife, or parts thereof, for which a
5 tag is required without an attached or validated tag, as applicable, is
6 prima facie evidence that the game is illegally taken and possessed.
7 2. It is unlawful to remove any tag from any wildlife for reuse
8 or to be in possession of excess tags or used tags.
9 3. Whenever tags are required for any species of fur-bearing
10 mammal, possession of a pelt of that species without the tag
11 attached thereto or validated, as applicable, is prima facie evidence
12 that such pelt is illegally taken and possessed.
13 4. A person may, for non-commercial purposes and without
14 obtaining the required tag, take or gather a skull or head of any
15 species of wildlife for which a tag is required, with or without
16 antlers or horns attached.
