EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to prisoners; revising provisions relating to certain
proceedings before the State Board of [Parole] Pardons
Commissioners; requiring the State Board of Parole Commissioners
to disseminate records of decisions regarding parole under certain
circumstances; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires: (1) an application to have a fine or forfeiture remitted, a
2 punishment commuted, a pardon granted or civil rights restored to be filed with the
3 State Board of Pardons Commissioners; and (2) a notice of the date, time and location of
4 a meeting to consider such an application, and a copy of the application, to be submitted
5 to certain persons, including the district judge of the county wherein the person was
6 convicted. (NRS 213.020) Section 1 of this bill: (1) removes the requirement for the
7 notice and application to be submitted to the district judge; and (2) provides that the
8 provisions of existing law relating to proceedings before the Board shall not be construed
9 to prohibit a district judge from providing certain testimony.
10 Existing law authorizes the State Board of Pardons Commissioners to adopt a policy
11 to provide an expedited process to restore the civil rights of a person if certain conditions
12 are met, including if there is no objection from the court in which the judgment was
13 rendered. (NRS 213.035) Section 1.3 of this bill removes the condition regarding an
14 objection from the court.
15 Existing law requires the State Board of Parole Commissioners to compile and maintain
16 certain information relating to decisions regarding parole. (NRS 213.10887) [This] Section
17 1.7 of this bill requires the Board to disseminate records of decisions regarding parole to any
18 person who requests such a record of a named prisoner.
