Senate Bill No. 30–Committee on Judiciary
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to prisoners; revising provisions relating to certain
proceedings before the State Board of Pardons
Commissioners; requiring the State Board of Parole
Commissioners to disseminate records of decisions regarding
parole under certain circumstances; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law requires: (1) an application to have a fine or forfeiture remitted, a
punishment commuted, a pardon granted or civil rights restored to be filed with the
State Board of Pardons Commissioners; and (2) a notice of the date, time and
location of a meeting to consider such an application, and a copy of the application,
to be submitted to certain persons, including the district judge of the county
wherein the person was convicted. (NRS 213.020) Section 1 of this bill: (1)
removes the requirement for the notice and application to be submitted to the
district judge; and (2) provides that the provisions of existing law relating to
proceedings before the Board shall not be construed to prohibit a district judge from
providing certain testimony.
Existing law authorizes the State Board of Pardons Commissioners to adopt a
policy to provide an expedited process to restore the civil rights of a person if
certain conditions are met, including if there is no objection from the court in which
the judgment was rendered. (NRS 213.035) Section 1.3 of this bill removes the
condition regarding an objection from the court.
Existing law requires the State Board of Parole Commissioners to compile and
maintain certain information relating to decisions regarding parole. (NRS
213.10887) Section 1.7 of this bill requires the Board to disseminate records of
decisions regarding parole to any person who requests such a record of a named
prisoner.
