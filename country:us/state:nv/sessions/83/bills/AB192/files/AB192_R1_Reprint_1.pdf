AN ACT relating to real property; enacting the Uniform Easement
Relocation Act; enacting the Uniform Mortgage
Modification Act; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Sections 2-32 of this bill enact the Uniform Easement Relocation Act
2 promulgated by the Uniform Law Commission in 2020. Sections 34-50 of this bill
3 enact the Uniform Mortgage Modification Act promulgated by the Uniform Law
4 Commission in 2024.
5 Generally, the Uniform Easement Relocation Act allows the owner of real
6 property burdened by certain types of easements to seek judicial approval to
7 relocate an easement if the relocation does not materially impair the utility of the
8 easement to the easement holder or the physical condition, use or value of the
9 benefitted property. Sections 4-21 define certain terms for the purposes of the Act.
10 Section 22 prohibits relocation under the Act of an easement: (1) where the holder
11 is a publicly regulated or publicly owned utility or a public entity; (2) which has
12 been set aside for certain conservation purposes; (3) which is associated with a
13 public road; (4) which is a negative easement that imposes a duty not to engage in a
14 specified use of the property; (5) if the proposed location encroaches on certain
15 land or interferes with the use or enjoyment or certain other easements; or (6)
16 which is created by a declaration of a common-interest community.
17 Section 24: (1) requires a property owner who wishes to relocate an easement
18 under the Act to file a civil action and serve a summons and complaint on the
19 easement holder and certain other interested persons; and (2) sets forth the required
20 contents of such a complaint. Sections 23 and 25 set forth: (1) the factors a court
21 must consider before approving the relocation of an easement under the Act; and
22 (2) the required contents of a court order approving such a relocation. If the court
23 approves the relocation of an easement, section 27 requires all parties to the civil
24 action to act in good faith to facilitate relocation. Section 26 requires the property
-
*AB192_R1*

– 2 –
25 owner seeking to relocate an easement to bear all reasonable expenses of the
26 relocation.
27 Before proceeding with the relocation of an easement which has been approved
28 by a court, section 25 requires the property owner to record: (1) a certified copy of
29 the court order approving the relocation in the land records of each jurisdiction
30 where the property is located; and (2) if the easement was established by the
31 recording of certain recorded maps, a certificate of amendment to any such map.
32 Section 28 deems such an easement relocated upon recording of the certified court
33 order and any certificate of amendment which is required.
34 If the relocation requires the construction of an improvement as a condition for
35 relocation, section 28 authorizes the easement holder to continue to use the existing
36 easement according to the terms of the court order until the property owner sends
37 certain required notice that the easement holder is able to enter, use and enjoy the
38 easement in the new location. Specifically, once the relocation is substantially
39 complete and the easement holder is able to enter, use and enjoy the easement in
40 the new location, section 28 requires the property owner relocating the easement to:
41 (1) execute an affidavit certifying that the easement has been relocated in
42 accordance with the order; (2) record the affidavit in the land records of each
43 jurisdiction in which the property is located; and (3) send a copy of the recorded
44 affidavit by certified mail to the easement holder and all parties to the civil action.
45 Sections 29 and 30 provide that: (1) the Act does not affect any other method
46 of relocating an easement which is permitted under existing law; and (2) the right
47 of a property owner to relocate an easement under the Act with court approval may
48 not be waived, excluded or restricted by agreement even in circumstances where
49 the instrument which created the easement contains certain restrictions. Section 29
50 also provides that a relocation under the Act does not constitute a new transfer or
51 grant of an interest in property, and thus is not a breach or default of certain
52 existing agreements.
53 Generally, the Uniform Mortgage Modification Act establishes safe harbor
54 provisions for several common categories of modifications which are not
55 prejudicial to junior interest holders and which do not affect the priority of the
56 mortgage. Modifications which are outside the scope of the Act remain governed
57 by existing law applicable to those modifications. Sections 36-46 define certain
58 terms for the purposes of the Act. Sections 47 and 48 establish the types of
59 modifications to which the Act does and does not apply. Section 48 provides that,
60 for a modification to which the Act applies: (1) the mortgage continues to secure
61 the obligation as modified; (2) the priority of the mortgage is not affected by the
62 modification; (3) the mortgage retains its priority even if the modification is not
63 recorded in the land records of a jurisdiction in which the property is located; and
64 (4) the modification is not a novation.
65 Section 48 also establishes the categories of modifications to which the Act
66 applies, which include: (1) an extension of the maturity date of the obligation; (2) a
67 decrease in the interest rate; (3) certain changes in the methods of calculating
68 interest which do not result in an increase as calculated on the date the modification
69 becomes effective; (4) a capitalization of interest or other unpaid monetary
70 obligations; (5) a forgiveness, forbearance or other reduction of a secured debt or
71 other monetary obligation; (6) a modification of a requirement for maintaining
72 certain escrow or reserve accounts; (7) a modification of a requirement for
73 acquiring or maintaining insurance; (8) a modification of an existing condition to
74 advance funds; (9) a modification of a financial covenant; and (10) a modification
75 of the payment amount or schedule resulting from another modification to which
76 the Act applies.
77 Section 47 provides that the Act does not affect existing law governing the
78 required content of a mortgage, statutes of limitation, recording, priority of certain
-
*AB192_R1*

– 3 –
79 liens, certain electronic transactions or the priority of certain future advances.
80 Section 47 also excludes certain modifications from the Act.
81 Sections 31 and 49 require a court to consider the uniformity of law among
82 jurisdictions that enact the Uniform Easement Relocation Act or the Uniform
83 Mortgage Modification Act in applying and construing the provisions of those
84 Acts. Sections 32 and 50 clarify the relation of the Uniform Easement Relocation
85 Act and the Uniform Mortgage Modification Act to the federal Electronic
86 Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act. (15 U.S.C. §§ 7001 et seq.)

1 3. If an order under section 25 of this act does not require an

4 under subsection 4 of section 25 of this act constitutes relocation.

34 creating the easement, another agreement, previous conduct,
35 acquiescence, estoppel or implication.
36 Sec. 31. In applying and construing this uniform act,
37 consideration must be given to the need to promote uniformity of
38 the law with respect to its subject matter among the states that
39 enact it.
40 Sec. 32. This chapter modifies, limits or supersedes the
