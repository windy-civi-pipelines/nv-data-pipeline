AN ACT relating to real property; enacting the Uniform Easement Relocation Act;
enacting the Uniform Mortgage Modification Act; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Sections 2-32 of this bill enact the Uniform Easement Relocation Act promulgated by the
2 Uniform Law Commission in 2020. Sections 34-50 of this bill enact the Uniform Mortgage
3 Modification Act promulgated by the Uniform Law Commission in 2024.
4 Generally, the Uniform Easement Relocation Act allows the owner of real property
5 burdened by certain types of easements to seek judicial approval to relocate an easement if the
6 relocation does not materially impair the utility of the easement to the easement holder or the
7 physical condition, use or value of the benefitted property. Sections 4-21 define certain terms
8 for the purposes of the Act. Section 22 prohibits relocation under the Act of an easement: (1)
9 where the holder is a publicly regulated or publicly owned utility [;] or a public entity; (2)
10 which has been set aside for certain conservation purposes; (3) which is associated with a
11 public road; (4) which is a negative easement that imposes a duty not to engage in a specified
12 use of the property; [or (4)] (5) if the proposed location encroaches on certain land or
13 interferes with the use or enjoyment or certain other easements [.] ; or (6) which is created
14 by a declaration of a common-interest community.
15 Section 24: (1) requires a property owner who wishes to relocate an easement under the
16 Act to file a civil action and serve a summons and complaint on the easement holder and
17 certain other interested persons; and (2) sets forth the required contents of such a complaint.
18 Sections 23 and 25 set forth: (1) the factors a court must consider before approving the
19 relocation of an easement under the Act; and (2) the required contents of a court order
20 approving such a relocation. If the court approves the relocation of an easement, section 27
21 requires all parties to the civil action to act in good faith to facilitate relocation. Section 26
22 requires the property owner seeking to relocate an easement to bear all reasonable expenses of
23 the relocation.
24 Before proceeding with the relocation of an easement which has been approved by a
25 court, section 25 requires the property owner to record : (1) a certified copy of the court order
26 approving the relocation in the land records of each jurisdiction where the property is located
27 [.] ; and (2) if the easement was established by the recording of certain recorded maps, a
28 certificate of amendment to any such map. Section 28 deems such an easement relocated
29 upon recording of the certified court order [.] and any certificate of amendment which is
30 required.
31 If the relocation requires the construction of an improvement as a condition for
32 relocation, section 28 authorizes the easement holder to continue to use the existing easement

Assembly Amendment No. 134 to Assembly Bill No. 192 Page 4
33 according to the terms of the court order until the property owner sends certain required notice
34 that the easement holder is able to enter, use and enjoy the easement in the new location.
35 Specifically, once the relocation is substantially complete and the easement holder is able to
36 enter, use and enjoy the easement in the new location, section 28 requires the property owner
37 relocating the easement to: (1) execute an affidavit certifying that the easement has been
38 relocated [;] in accordance with the order; (2) record the affidavit in the land records of each
39 jurisdiction in which the property is located; and (3) send a copy of the recorded affidavit by
40 certified mail to the easement holder and all parties to the civil action.
41 Sections 29 and 30 provide that: (1) the Act does not affect any other method of
42 relocating an easement which is permitted under existing law; and (2) the right of a property
43 owner to relocate an easement under the Act with court approval may not be waived, excluded
44 or restricted by agreement even in circumstances where the instrument which created the
45 easement contains certain restrictions. Section 29 also provides that a relocation under the Act
46 does not constitute a new transfer or grant of an interest in property, and thus is not a breach
47 or default of certain existing agreements.
48 Generally, the Uniform Mortgage Modification Act establishes safe harbor provisions for
49 several common categories of modifications which are not prejudicial to junior interest
50 holders and which do not affect the priority of the mortgage. Modifications which are outside
51 the scope of the Act remain governed by existing law applicable to those modifications.
52 Sections 36-46 define certain terms for the purposes of the Act. Sections 47 and 48 establish
53 the types of modifications to which the Act does and does not apply. Section 48 provides that,
54 for a modification to which the Act applies: (1) the mortgage continues to secure the
55 obligation as modified; (2) the priority of the mortgage is not affected by the modification; (3)
56 the mortgage retains its priority even if the modification is not recorded in the land records of
57 a jurisdiction in which the property is located; and (4) the modification is not a novation.
58 Section 48 also establishes the categories of modifications to which the Act applies,
59 which include: (1) an extension of the maturity date of the obligation; (2) a decrease in the
60 interest rate; (3) certain changes in the methods of calculating interest which do not result in
61 an increase as calculated on the date the modification becomes effective; (4) a capitalization
62 of interest or other unpaid monetary obligations; (5) a forgiveness, forbearance or other
63 reduction of a secured debt or other monetary obligation; (6) a modification of a requirement
64 for maintaining certain escrow or reserve accounts; (7) a modification of a requirement for
65 acquiring or maintaining insurance; (8) a modification of an existing condition to advance
66 funds; (9) a modification of a financial covenant; and (10) a modification of the payment
67 amount or schedule resulting from another modification to which the Act applies.
68 Section 47 provides that the Act does not affect existing law governing the required
69 content of a mortgage, statutes of limitation, recording, priority of certain liens, certain
70 electronic transactions or the priority of certain future advances. Section 47 also excludes
71 certain modifications from the Act.
72 Sections 31 and 49 require a court to consider the uniformity of law among jurisdictions
73 that enact the Uniform Easement Relocation Act or the Uniform Mortgage Modification Act
74 in applying and construing the provisions of those Acts. Sections 32 and 50 clarify the
75 relation of the Uniform Easement Relocation Act and the Uniform Mortgage Modification Act
76 to the federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act. (15 U.S.C. §§
77 7001 et seq.)
