Section 1:
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to real property; enacting the Uniform Easement
Relocation Act; enacting the Uniform Mortgage Modification
Act; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:

Section 2:
Sections 2-32 of this bill enact the Uniform Easement Relocation Act
promulgated by the Uniform Law Commission in 2020. Sections 34-50 of this bill
enact the Uniform Mortgage Modification Act promulgated by the Uniform Law
Commission in 2024.
Generally, the Uniform Easement Relocation Act allows the owner of real
property burdened by certain types of easements to seek judicial approval to
relocate an easement if the relocation does not materially impair the utility of the
easement to the easement holder or the physical condition, use or value of the
benefitted property. Sections 4-21 define certain terms for the purposes of the Act.

Section 3:
Section 22 prohibits relocation under the Act of an easement: (1) where the holder
is a publicly regulated or publicly owned utility or a public entity; (2) which has
been set aside for certain conservation purposes; (3) which is associated with a
public road; (4) which is a negative easement that imposes a duty not to engage in a
specified use of the property; (5) if the proposed location encroaches on certain
land or interferes with the use or enjoyment or certain other easements; or (6)
which is created by a declaration of a common-interest community.

Section 4:
Section 24: (1) requires a property owner who wishes to relocate an easement
under the Act to file a civil action and serve a summons and complaint on the
easement holder and certain other interested persons; and (2) sets forth the required
contents of such a complaint. Sections 23 and 25 set forth: (1) the factors a court
must consider before approving the relocation of an easement under the Act; and
(2) the required contents of a court order approving such a relocation. If the court
approves the relocation of an easement, section 27 requires all parties to the civil
action to act in good faith to facilitate relocation. Section 26 requires the property
owner seeking to relocate an easement to bear all reasonable expenses of the
relocation.
Before proceeding with the relocation of an easement which has been approved
by a court, section 25 requires the property owner to record: (1) a certified copy of
the court order approving the relocation in the land records of each jurisdiction
where the property is located; and (2) if the easement was established by the
recording of certain recorded maps, a certificate of amendment to any such map.

Section 5:
Section 28 deems such an easement relocated upon recording of the certified court
order and any certificate of amendment which is required.
If the relocation requires the construction of an improvement as a condition for
relocation, section 28 authorizes the easement holder to continue to use the existing
easement according to the terms of the court order until the property owner sends
certain required notice that the easement holder is able to enter, use and enjoy the
easement in the new location. Specifically, once the relocation is substantially
complete and the easement holder is able to enter, use and enjoy the easement in
the new location, section 28 requires the property owner relocating the easement to:
(1) execute an affidavit certifying that the easement has been relocated in
accordance with the order; (2) record the affidavit in the land records of each
jurisdiction in which the property is located; and (3) send a copy of the recorded
affidavit by certified mail to the easement holder and all parties to the civil action.

Section 6:
Sections 29 and 30 provide that: (1) the Act does not affect any other method
of relocating an easement which is permitted under existing law; and (2) the right
of a property owner to relocate an easement under the Act with court approval may
not be waived, excluded or restricted by agreement even in circumstances where
the instrument which created the easement contains certain restrictions. Section 29
also provides that a relocation under the Act does not constitute a new transfer or
grant of an interest in property, and thus is not a breach or default of certain
existing agreements.
Generally, the Uniform Mortgage Modification Act establishes safe harbor
provisions for several common categories of modifications which are not
prejudicial to junior interest holders and which do not affect the priority of the
mortgage. Modifications which are outside the scope of the Act remain governed
by existing law applicable to those modifications. Sections 36-46 define certain
terms for the purposes of the Act. Sections 47 and 48 establish the types of
modifications to which the Act does and does not apply. Section 48 provides that,
for a modification to which the Act applies: (1) the mortgage continues to secure
the obligation as modified; (2) the priority of the mortgage is not affected by the
modification; (3) the mortgage retains its priority even if the modification is not
recorded in the land records of a jurisdiction in which the property is located; and
(4) the modification is not a novation.

Section 7:
Section 48 also establishes the categories of modifications to which the Act
applies, which include: (1) an extension of the maturity date of the obligation; (2) a
decrease in the interest rate; (3) certain changes in the methods of calculating
interest which do not result in an increase as calculated on the date the modification
becomes effective; (4) a capitalization of interest or other unpaid monetary
obligations; (5) a forgiveness, forbearance or other reduction of a secured debt or
other monetary obligation; (6) a modification of a requirement for maintaining
certain escrow or reserve accounts; (7) a modification of a requirement for
acquiring or maintaining insurance; (8) a modification of an existing condition to
advance funds; (9) a modification of a financial covenant; and (10) a modification
of the payment amount or schedule resulting from another modification to which
the Act applies.

Section 8:
Section 47 provides that the Act does not affect existing law governing the
required content of a mortgage, statutes of limitation, recording, priority of certain
liens, certain electronic transactions or the priority of certain future advances.

Section 9:
Section 47 also excludes certain modifications from the Act.

Section 10:
Sections 31 and 49 require a court to consider the uniformity of law among
jurisdictions that enact the Uniform Easement Relocation Act or the Uniform
Mortgage Modification Act in applying and construing the provisions of those
Acts. Sections 32 and 50 clarify the relation of the Uniform Easement Relocation
Act and the Uniform Mortgage Modification Act to the federal Electronic
Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act. (15 U.S.C. §§ 7001 et seq.)

Raw Text:
Assembly Bill No. 192–Assemblymember Backus
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to real property; enacting the Uniform Easement
Relocation Act; enacting the Uniform Mortgage Modification
Act; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Sections 2-32 of this bill enact the Uniform Easement Relocation Act
promulgated by the Uniform Law Commission in 2020. Sections 34-50 of this bill
enact the Uniform Mortgage Modification Act promulgated by the Uniform Law
Commission in 2024.
Generally, the Uniform Easement Relocation Act allows the owner of real
property burdened by certain types of easements to seek judicial approval to
relocate an easement if the relocation does not materially impair the utility of the
easement to the easement holder or the physical condition, use or value of the
benefitted property. Sections 4-21 define certain terms for the purposes of the Act.
Section 22 prohibits relocation under the Act of an easement: (1) where the holder
is a publicly regulated or publicly owned utility or a public entity; (2) which has
been set aside for certain conservation purposes; (3) which is associated with a
public road; (4) which is a negative easement that imposes a duty not to engage in a
specified use of the property; (5) if the proposed location encroaches on certain
land or interferes with the use or enjoyment or certain other easements; or (6)
which is created by a declaration of a common-interest community.
Section 24: (1) requires a property owner who wishes to relocate an easement
under the Act to file a civil action and serve a summons and complaint on the
easement holder and certain other interested persons; and (2) sets forth the required
contents of such a complaint. Sections 23 and 25 set forth: (1) the factors a court
must consider before approving the relocation of an easement under the Act; and
(2) the required contents of a court order approving such a relocation. If the court
approves the relocation of an easement, section 27 requires all parties to the civil
action to act in good faith to facilitate relocation. Section 26 requires the property
owner seeking to relocate an easement to bear all reasonable expenses of the
relocation.
Before proceeding with the relocation of an easement which has been approved
by a court, section 25 requires the property owner to record: (1) a certified copy of
the court order approving the relocation in the land records of each jurisdiction
where the property is located; and (2) if the easement was established by the
recording of certain recorded maps, a certificate of amendment to any such map.
Section 28 deems such an easement relocated upon recording of the certified court
order and any certificate of amendment which is required.
If the relocation requires the construction of an improvement as a condition for
relocation, section 28 authorizes the easement holder to continue to use the existing
easement according to the terms of the court order until the property owner sends
certain required notice that the easement holder is able to enter, use and enjoy the
easement in the new location. Specifically, once the relocation is substantially
complete and the easement holder is able to enter, use and enjoy the easement in
the new location, section 28 requires the property owner relocating the easement to:
(1) execute an affidavit certifying that the easement has been relocated in
accordance with the order; (2) record the affidavit in the land records of each
jurisdiction in which the property is located; and (3) send a copy of the recorded
affidavit by certified mail to the easement holder and all parties to the civil action.
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 2 –
Sections 29 and 30 provide that: (1) the Act does not affect any other method
of relocating an easement which is permitted under existing law; and (2) the right
of a property owner to relocate an easement under the Act with court approval may
not be waived, excluded or restricted by agreement even in circumstances where
the instrument which created the easement contains certain restrictions. Section 29
also provides that a relocation under the Act does not constitute a new transfer or
grant of an interest in property, and thus is not a breach or default of certain
existing agreements.
Generally, the Uniform Mortgage Modification Act establishes safe harbor
provisions for several common categories of modifications which are not
prejudicial to junior interest holders and which do not affect the priority of the
mortgage. Modifications which are outside the scope of the Act remain governed
by existing law applicable to those modifications. Sections 36-46 define certain
terms for the purposes of the Act. Sections 47 and 48 establish the types of
modifications to which the Act does and does not apply. Section 48 provides that,
for a modification to which the Act applies: (1) the mortgage continues to secure
the obligation as modified; (2) the priority of the mortgage is not affected by the
modification; (3) the mortgage retains its priority even if the modification is not
recorded in the land records of a jurisdiction in which the property is located; and
(4) the modification is not a novation.
Section 48 also establishes the categories of modifications to which the Act
applies, which include: (1) an extension of the maturity date of the obligation; (2) a
decrease in the interest rate; (3) certain changes in the methods of calculating
interest which do not result in an increase as calculated on the date the modification
becomes effective; (4) a capitalization of interest or other unpaid monetary
obligations; (5) a forgiveness, forbearance or other reduction of a secured debt or
other monetary obligation; (6) a modification of a requirement for maintaining
certain escrow or reserve accounts; (7) a modification of a requirement for
acquiring or maintaining insurance; (8) a modification of an existing condition to
advance funds; (9) a modification of a financial covenant; and (10) a modification
of the payment amount or schedule resulting from another modification to which
the Act applies.
Section 47 provides that the Act does not affect existing law governing the
required content of a mortgage, statutes of limitation, recording, priority of certain
liens, certain electronic transactions or the priority of certain future advances.
Section 47 also excludes certain modifications from the Act.
Sections 31 and 49 require a court to consider the uniformity of law among
jurisdictions that enact the Uniform Easement Relocation Act or the Uniform
Mortgage Modification Act in applying and construing the provisions of those
Acts. Sections 32 and 50 clarify the relation of the Uniform Easement Relocation
Act and the Uniform Mortgage Modification Act to the federal Electronic
Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act. (15 U.S.C. §§ 7001 et seq.)
