AN ACT relating to public works; revising provisions governing the
circumstances under which a worker is deemed to be

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires that mechanics and workers employed on certain public
2 works be paid, at minimum, the prevailing wage for the type of work that the
3 mechanic or worker performs in the region in which the public work is located.
4 (NRS 338.020) With certain exceptions, existing law deems a worker to be
5 employed on a public work if the worker is: (1) employed at the site of a public
6 work; and (2) necessary in the execution of the contract for the public work. (NRS
7 338.040) Section 1 of this bill provides that a worker who is: (1) employed by
8 delivering or removing construction material or structures to or from the site of a
9 public work; and (2) necessary in the execution of the contract for the public work
10 is also deemed to be employed on the public work for purposes of the payment of
11 prevailing wages. Section 1 further defines “construction material or structures” to
12 mean aggregate, asphalt and concrete.
13 Section 1.3 of this bill makes an appropriation to the Office of the Labor
14 Commissioner in the Department of Business and Industry for personnel, operating,
15 travel and information services costs for compliance and enforcement duties related
16 to the provisions of this bill.
