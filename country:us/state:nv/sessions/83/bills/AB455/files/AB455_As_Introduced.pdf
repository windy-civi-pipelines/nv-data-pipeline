AN ACT relating to taxation; providing that flags and certain related
personal property are exempt from property taxes;

and their surviving spouses by the amount of the assessed
valuation of any flagpole that is a fixture or improvement

properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 The Nevada Constitution requires the Legislature to provide by law for a
2 uniform and equal rate of assessment and taxation of all property, with certain
3 exception. (Nev. Const. Art. 10, § 1(1)) According to the Nevada Supreme Court,
4 because the requirement for a uniform and equal rate of assessment and taxation of
5 property “declares that all property shall be taxed except mines and other property
6 for certain enumerated purposes, the legislature cannot exempt any taxable
7 property, except for” a purpose stated in the Nevada Constitution. (State v. Carson
8 Savings Bank, 17 Nev. 146, 151 (1882)) The Nevada Constitution authorizes the
9 Legislature to exempt from taxation property used for charitable purposes, which
10 includes, without limitation, authorization to exempt from property taxes property
11 in which certain veterans have an interest. (Nev. Const. Art. 10, § 1(8); Hendel v.
12 Weaver, 77 Nev. 16 (1961))
13 Under existing law: (1) a veteran who served on active duty under certain
14 circumstances is entitled to an exemption from property taxes of $2,000 of the
15 assessed valuation of property in which the veteran has an interest, as adjusted each
16 fiscal year using the Consumer Price Index; and (2) a veteran with a permanent
17 service-connected disability, or the surviving spouse of such a veteran, is entitled
18 an exemption from property taxes of an amount of assessed valuation that is based
19 on the percentage of service-connected disability incurred by the veteran.

20 (NRS 361.090, 361.091) Sections 2 and 3 of this bill increase the amount of these
21 exemptions from property taxes by the amount of any assessed valuation
22 attributable to a flagpole that is considered real property because it is a fixture or
23 improvement to any real property in which the person claiming the exemption has
24 an interest.
25 The Nevada Constitution exempts from property taxes “[a]ll household goods
26 and furniture used by a single household and owned by a member of that
27 household.” (Nev. Const. Art. 10, § 3) Under existing law, the household goods that
28 are exempt from property taxes include, without limitation, clothing, personal
29 effects, appliances that are not attached to real property, portable goods and storage
30 sheds. (NRS 361.069) Section 1 of this bill includes as household goods that are
31 exempt from property taxes flags and flagpoles that are considered personal
32 property because they are not attached to real property.
