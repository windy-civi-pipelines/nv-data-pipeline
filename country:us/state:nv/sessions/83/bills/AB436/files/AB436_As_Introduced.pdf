EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to firearms; removing and revising certain
exemptions of The Background Check Act; revising
provisions relating to the forms prescribed for a permit to
carry a concealed firearm and for the renewal of such a
permit; revising provisions relating to courses in firearm
safety that are required to be completed to obtain a permit
to carry a concealed firearm; revising provisions
governing the renewal of a permit to carry a concealed
firearm; authorizing a retired law enforcement officer
who is not a resident of this State to apply to any sheriff
for certification to become a qualified retired law
enforcement officer; prohibiting the Central Repository

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law commonly known and cited as The Background Check Act
2 requires a licensed firearm dealer to conduct a background check on a person who
3 wishes to buy or receive a firearm from an unlicensed person. Existing law also
4 provides certain exemptions from the requirement to conduct a background check
5 when a private person is selling or transferring a firearm. (NRS 202.2544-
6 202.2549) Section 1 of this bill: (1) removes the requirement that a peace officer,
7 security guard entitled to carry a firearm, member of the armed forces or federal
8 official must be acting within the scope of his or her employment and official duties
-

– 2 –
9 for the exemption to be effective; and (2) adds a qualified retired law enforcement
10 officer to the list of persons exempted from the Act.
11 Existing law authorizes a person to apply to the sheriff to obtain a permit to
12 carry a concealed firearm and sets forth various requirements and conditions related
13 to the issuance of such permits. (NRS 202.3657) Section 2 of this bill requires: (1)
14 any application for a permit to carry a concealed firearm to be on a uniform
15 statewide form prescribed by regulation of the Department of Public Safety; and (2)
16 a sheriff to determine that a course in firearm safety meets any uniform statewide
17 standards that are established by the Nevada Sheriffs’ and Chiefs’ Association or, if
18 the Nevada Sheriffs’ and Chiefs’ Association ceases to exist, its legal successor.
19 Existing law provides that a permit to carry a concealed firearm may not be
20 renewed unless the person has demonstrated continued competence with handguns
21 by successfully completing a course prescribed by the sheriff renewing the permit.
22 (NRS 202.3677) Section 3 of this bill prohibits a sheriff from prescribing such a
23 course unless the sheriff determines that the course meets any uniform statewide
24 standards, including, without limitation, the timeframe for completing the course
25 and the length of the course, that are established for renewing a permit by the
26 Nevada Sheriffs’ and Chiefs’ Association or, if the Nevada Sheriffs’ and Chiefs’
27 Association ceases to exist, its legal successor.
28 Existing law authorizes a retired law enforcement officer who is a resident of
29 this State to apply to the sheriff of the county in which he or she resides for
30 certification to become a qualified retired law enforcement officer. (NRS 202.3678)
31 Such certification confirms that the retired law enforcement officer meets the
32 requirements to carry a concealed firearm under Nevada law and federal law. (NRS
33 202.350; 18 U.S.C. § 926C) Section 4 of this bill: (1) requires an application to
34 become a qualified retired law enforcement officer to be on a uniform statewide
35 form prescribed by the Department of Public Safety; and (2) authorizes a retired
36 law enforcement officer who is not a resident of this State to apply to any sheriff
37 for certification to become a qualified retired law enforcement officer.
38 Existing law authorizes an agency of criminal justice to charge a reasonable fee
39 for information relating to records of criminal history provided to any person or
40 governmental entity. (NRS 179A.140) Section 5 of this bill prohibits the Central
41 Repository for Nevada Records of Criminal History from charging a fee for
42 information provided to a licensed firearm dealer if the dealer is required to conduct
43 a background check pursuant to federal law for a peace officer or qualified retired
44 law enforcement officer.
