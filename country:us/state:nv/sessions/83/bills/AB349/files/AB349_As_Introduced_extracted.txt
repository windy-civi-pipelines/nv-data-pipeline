~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; establishing maximum rates that
hospitals, independent centers for emergency medical
care and surgical centers for ambulatory patients may
charge for certain goods and services provided to patients
covered by certain insurance for public employees;
requiring hospitals to publish certain information relating
to pricing; authorizing the imposition of certain
administrative penalties and sanctions; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates the Public Employees’ Benefits Program to provide group
2 life, accident or health insurance to certain public employees, state officers and
3 members of the Legislature in this State. (NRS 287.043) Existing law also
4 prescribes a procedure to determine the amount that a third party which provides
5 health coverage to a person, including the Public Employees’ Benefits Program, is
6 required to pay to an out-of-network hospital, independent center for emergency
7 medical care or other provider of health care for medically necessary emergency
8 services rendered to that person. (NRS 439B.700-439B.760) Section 5 of this bill
9 establishes maximum rates that hospitals, independent centers for emergency
10 medical care and surgical centers for ambulatory patients may charge for goods and
11 services when provided to a patient who is covered by the Program or a local
12 government employer that elects to be subject to those maximum rates. Those
13 maximum rates differ depending on whether the facility is an in-network facility or
14 an out-of-network facility. Section 5 authorizes the Division of Health Care
15 Financing and Policy of the Department of Health and Human Services to increase
16 those maximum rates if: (1) the Division determines that health care facilities in
-
*AB349*
– 2 –
17 this State are experiencing financial hardship due to a decrease in the rates of
18 reimbursement provided under Medicaid; and (2) the Interim Finance Committee
19 approves the increase. Section 11 of this bill authorizes the Interim Finance
20 Committee to consider such an increase during a regular or special session of the
21 Legislature. Section 9 of this bill prescribes the manner in which a local
22 government employer may opt in to the provisions of section 5.
23 Section 19 of this bill requires the Board and each participating local
24 government employer to consider the change in rates as a result of implementing
25 section 5 when assessing the cost of premiums of contributions for the Program.
26 Sections 3 and 4 of this bill define necessary terms, and section 2 of this bill
27 establishes the applicability of those definitions. Section 6 of this bill requires the
28 Division to annually submit to the Legislature a report concerning the impacts of
29 the maximum rates established by section 5.
30 Section 7 of this bill requires the Division to adopt certain regulations to
31 implement sections 2-8 of this bill, including regulations prescribing civil penalties
32 to be imposed against a health care facility that charges the Program or a
33 participating local government employer an amount that exceeds the maximum
34 rates prescribed by section 5. Sections 8 and 14 of this bill provide for the
35 imposition of disciplinary action against a health care facility for such a violation.
36 Section 8 also authorizes: (1) the Division or Attorney General to maintain a suit
37 for an injunction against such a violation; and (2) any person or entity injured by
38 such a violation to maintain a suit for damages and attorney’s fees and costs.
39 Section 10 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law relating to the
40 Program to the provisions of sections 2-8. Sections 13 and 16 of this bill make
41 conforming changes to clarify the application of existing provisions concerning the
42 rates that a health care facility, including a county hospital, may charge for certain
43 services. Sections 17 and 18 of this bill make conforming changes to clarify the
44 applicability of certain provisions of existing law relating to the Program. (NRS
45 687B.409, 689B.065)
46 Existing federal regulations require a hospital to publish: (1) a list of standard
47 charges for all items and services provided by the hospital; and (2) a consumer-
48 friendly list of standard charges for a limited set of shoppable services, which are
49 services provided by a hospital that can be scheduled by a consumer in advance.
50 (45 C.F.R. §§ 180.20, 180.40-180.60) Section 12 of this bill requires each hospital
51 in this State to comply with those federal requirements, and sections 12, 14 and 15
52 authorize the imposition of disciplinary action against a hospital that fails to
53 comply with those requirements.

A.B. 349
ASSEMBLY BILL NO. 349–ASSEMBLYMEMBER ORENTLICHER
MARCH 3, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Health and Human Services
SUMMARY—Makes revisions relating to health care.
(BDR 23-343)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
CONTAINS UNFUNDED MANDATE (§§ 8, 14, 18)
(NOT REQUESTED BY AFFECTED LOCAL GOVERNMENT)
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; establishing maximum rates that
hospitals, independent centers for emergency medical
care and surgical centers for ambulatory patients may
charge for certain goods and services provided to patients
covered by certain insurance for public employees;
requiring hospitals to publish certain information relating
to pricing; authorizing the imposition of certain
administrative penalties and sanctions; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates the Public Employees’ Benefits Program to provide group
2 life, accident or health insurance to certain public employees, state officers and
3 members of the Legislature in this State. (NRS 287.043) Existing law also
4 prescribes a procedure to determine the amount that a third party which provides
5 health coverage to a person, including the Public Employees’ Benefits Program, is
6 required to pay to an out-of-network hospital, independent center for emergency
7 medical care or other provider of health care for medically necessary emergency
8 services rendered to that person. (NRS 439B.700-439B.760) Section 5 of this bill
9 establishes maximum rates that hospitals, independent centers for emergency
10 medical care and surgical centers for ambulatory patients may charge for goods and
11 services when provided to a patient who is covered by the Program or a local
12 government employer that elects to be subject to those maximum rates. Those
13 maximum rates differ depending on whether the facility is an in-network facility or
14 an out-of-network facility. Section 5 authorizes the Division of Health Care
15 Financing and Policy of the Department of Health and Human Services to increase
16 those maximum rates if: (1) the Division determines that health care facilities in
-
*AB349*

– 2 –
17 this State are experiencing financial hardship due to a decrease in the rates of
18 reimbursement provided under Medicaid; and (2) the Interim Finance Committee
19 approves the increase. Section 11 of this bill authorizes the Interim Finance
20 Committee to consider such an increase during a regular or special session of the
21 Legislature. Section 9 of this bill prescribes the manner in which a local
22 government employer may opt in to the provisions of section 5.
23 Section 19 of this bill requires the Board and each participating local
24 government employer to consider the change in rates as a result of implementing
25 section 5 when assessing the cost of premiums of contributions for the Program.
26 Sections 3 and 4 of this bill define necessary terms, and section 2 of this bill
27 establishes the applicability of those definitions. Section 6 of this bill requires the
28 Division to annually submit to the Legislature a report concerning the impacts of
29 the maximum rates established by section 5.
30 Section 7 of this bill requires the Division to adopt certain regulations to
31 implement sections 2-8 of this bill, including regulations prescribing civil penalties
32 to be imposed against a health care facility that charges the Program or a
33 participating local government employer an amount that exceeds the maximum
34 rates prescribed by section 5. Sections 8 and 14 of this bill provide for the
35 imposition of disciplinary action against a health care facility for such a violation.
36 Section 8 also authorizes: (1) the Division or Attorney General to maintain a suit
37 for an injunction against such a violation; and (2) any person or entity injured by
38 such a violation to maintain a suit for damages and attorney’s fees and costs.
39 Section 10 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law relating to the
40 Program to the provisions of sections 2-8. Sections 13 and 16 of this bill make
41 conforming changes to clarify the application of existing provisions concerning the
42 rates that a health care facility, including a county hospital, may charge for certain
43 services. Sections 17 and 18 of this bill make conforming changes to clarify the
44 applicability of certain provisions of existing law relating to the Program. (NRS
45 687B.409, 689B.065)
46 Existing federal regulations require a hospital to publish: (1) a list of standard
47 charges for all items and services provided by the hospital; and (2) a consumer-
48 friendly list of standard charges for a limited set of shoppable services, which are
49 services provided by a hospital that can be scheduled by a consumer in advance.
50 (45 C.F.R. §§ 180.20, 180.40-180.60) Section 12 of this bill requires each hospital
51 in this State to comply with those federal requirements, and sections 12, 14 and 15
52 authorize the imposition of disciplinary action against a hospital that fails to
53 comply with those requirements.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 287 of NRS is hereby amended by adding
2 thereto the provisions set forth as sections 2 to 8, inclusive, of this

28 (a) The billed charge for the service;

33 reimbursement provided by Medicare for the same or similar
34 services on the date on which the service is provided.
35 3. The Division, with the approval of the Interim Finance
36 Committee, may increase the maximum rates of reimbursement
37 prescribed by subsections 1 and 2 if the Division determines that
38 health care facilities in this State are experiencing financial
39 hardship due to a decrease in the rates of reimbursement provided
40 under Medicaid.
41 4. Nothing in this section prohibits the Board or an opt-in
42 local government from reimbursing a health care facility through
43 a payment model other than fee-for-service as long as:
