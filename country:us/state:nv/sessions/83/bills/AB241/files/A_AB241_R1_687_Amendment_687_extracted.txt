EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to housing; requiring the governing body of each county and city
to adopt an ordinance to authorize by-right a multifamily housing
development or mixed-use development that includes a residential use
on property zoned for commercial use; declaring void certain county or
city ordinances; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Section 1 of this bill requires each governing body of a county or city to adopt an
2 ordinance that authorizes by-right a multifamily housing development or mixed-use
3 development that includes a residential use on property zoned for commercial use. Section 1
4 also authorizes such an ordinance to establish certain standards and requirements to
5 qualify for such a by-right development. Section 1 further provides that any such
6 ordinance does not apply to any property: (1) that is zoned for or in relation to an
7 airport; or (2) within the region defined in the Tahoe Regional Planning Compact. (NRS
8 277.200) Section 1 further provides that property zoned for commercial use does not include
9 property zoned for industrial use. Section 5 of this bill declares void any ordinance, regulation
10 or rule of a county or city which conflicts with the provisions of this bill.
11 Existing law authorizes the governing body of a county or city to divide the county, city
12 or region into zoning districts of such number, shape and area as are best suited to carry out
13 certain purposes. Within a zoning district, the governing body may regulate and restrict the
14 erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair or use of buildings, structures or land.
15 (NRS 278.250) Section 4 of this bill creates an exception to account for the requirement that
16 the governing body of a county or city adopt an ordinance to authorize by-right a multifamily
17 housing development or mixed-use development that includes a residential use on property
18 zoned for commercial use pursuant to section 1.
19 Existing law requires that an action or proceeding seeking judicial relief or review from
20 or with respect to any final action, decision or order of any governing body of a county or city
21 be commenced within 25 days after the date of filing of notice of the final action, decision or
22 order with the clerk or secretary of the governing body. (NRS 278.0235) Section 3 of this bill
23 applies these provisions to section 1.
24 Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to apply the definitions of certain terms
25 relating to planning and zoning to section 1.
