Assembly Bill No. 241–Assemblymember Jauregui
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to housing; requiring the governing body of each
county and city to adopt an ordinance to authorize by-right a
multifamily housing development or mixed-use development
that includes a residential use on property zoned for
commercial use; declaring void certain county or city
ordinances; authorizing the State Land Registrar to transfer,
under certain circumstances, certain real property owned by
the State of Nevada to certain entities without consideration;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Section 1 of this bill requires each governing body of a county or city to adopt
an ordinance that authorizes by-right a multifamily housing development or mixed-
use development that includes a residential use on property zoned for commercial
use. Section 1 also authorizes such an ordinance to establish certain standards and
requirements to qualify for such a by-right development. Section 1 further provides
that any such ordinance does not apply to any property: (1) that is zoned for or in
relation to an airport; or (2) within the region defined in the Tahoe Regional
Planning Compact. (NRS 277.200) Section 1 further provides that property zoned
for commercial use does not include property zoned for industrial use. Section 5 of
this bill declares void any ordinance, regulation or rule of a county or city which
conflicts with the provisions of this bill.
Existing law authorizes the governing body of a county or city to divide the
county, city or region into zoning districts of such number, shape and area as are
best suited to carry out certain purposes. Within a zoning district, the governing
body may regulate and restrict the erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration,
repair or use of buildings, structures or land. (NRS 278.250) Section 4 of this bill
creates an exception to account for the requirement that the governing body of a
county or city adopt an ordinance to authorize by-right a multifamily housing
development or mixed-use development that includes a residential use on property
zoned for commercial use pursuant to section 1.
Existing law requires that an action or proceeding seeking judicial relief or
review from or with respect to any final action, decision or order of any governing
body of a county or city be commenced within 25 days after the date of filing of
notice of the final action, decision or order with the clerk or secretary of the
governing body. (NRS 278.0235) Section 3 of this bill applies these provisions to
section 1.
Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to apply the definitions of
certain terms relating to planning and zoning to section 1.
Existing law requires the State Land Registrar to execute on behalf of the State
of Nevada any lease, deed or other document by which any land or interest therein
owned by the State is conveyed. (NRS 321.003) Section 5.3 of this bill authorizes
the State Land Registrar to transfer title to certain real property owned by the State,
with certain restrictions, to Catholic Charities of Northern Nevada and the Reno-
Sparks Gospel Mission. Section 5.3 provides that such a transfer is conditioned
upon the Reno Redevelopment Agency entering into certain agreements with
Catholic Charities of Northern Nevada or the Reno-Sparks Gospel Mission. Section
5.3 further provides that such agreements must require the Reno Redevelopment

Agency to: (1) survey and generate a legal description for the portions of real
property that the State Land Registrar is authorized to transfer to each entity; and
(2) pay the costs relating to the transfer of the real properties. Section 5.5 of this
bill requires the deed for the real properties to include certain restrictions and
provide for the reversion of the title to the real properties under certain
circumstances.
