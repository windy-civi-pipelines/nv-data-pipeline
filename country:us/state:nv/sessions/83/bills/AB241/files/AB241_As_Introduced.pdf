AN ACT relating to housing; requiring the governing body of each

person to apply for a permit to construct a multifamily

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Section 1 of this bill requires each governing body of a county or city to adopt
2 an ordinance that authorizes a person to apply for a permit to construct a
3 multifamily housing development or mixed-use development on property zoned for
4 commercial use. Section 1 further requires such an ordinance to set forth an
5 expedited process for the approval of the application and any appeal of the denial of
6 such an application. Section 5 of this bill declares void any ordinance, regulation or
7 rule of a county or city which conflicts with the provisions of this bill.
8 Existing law authorizes the governing body of a county or city to divide the
9 county, city or region into zoning districts of such number, shape and area as are
10 best suited to carry out certain purposes. Within a zoning district, the governing
11 body may regulate and restrict the erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration,
12 repair or use of buildings, structures or land. (NRS 278.250) Section 4 of this bill
13 creates an exception to account for the requirement that the governing body of a
14 county or city adopt an ordinance to authorize a person to apply for a permit to
15 construct a multifamily housing development or mixed-use development on
16 property zoned for commercial use pursuant to section 1.
17 Existing law requires that an action or proceeding seeking judicial relief or
18 review from or with respect to any final action, decision or order of any governing
19 body of a county or city be commenced within 25 days after the date of filing of
20 notice of the final action, decision or order with the clerk or secretary of the

24 certain terms relating to planning and zoning to section 1.
