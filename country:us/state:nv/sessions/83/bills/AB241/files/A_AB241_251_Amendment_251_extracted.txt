development that includes a residential use on property zoned for
commercial use; declaring void certain county or city ordinances; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Section 1 of this bill requires each governing body of a county or city to adopt an
2 ordinance that authorizes [a person to apply for a permit to construct] by-right a multifamily
3 housing development or mixed-use development that includes a residential use on property
4 zoned for commercial use. Section 1 further [requires such an ordinance to set forth an
5 expedited process for the approval of the application and any appeal of the denial of such an
6 application.] provides that property zoned for commercial use does not include property
7 zoned for industrial use. Section 5 of this bill declares void any ordinance, regulation or rule
8 of a county or city which conflicts with the provisions of this bill.
9 Existing law authorizes the governing body of a county or city to divide the county, city
10 or region into zoning districts of such number, shape and area as are best suited to carry out
11 certain purposes. Within a zoning district, the governing body may regulate and restrict the
12 erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair or use of buildings, structures or land.
13 (NRS 278.250) Section 4 of this bill creates an exception to account for the requirement that
14 the governing body of a county or city adopt an ordinance to authorize [a person to apply for a
15 permit to construct] by-right a multifamily housing development or mixed-use development
16 that includes a residential use on property zoned for commercial use pursuant to section 1.
17 Existing law requires that an action or proceeding seeking judicial relief or review from
18 or with respect to any final action, decision or order of any governing body of a county or city
19 be commenced within 25 days after the date of filing of notice of the final action, decision or
20 order with the clerk or secretary of the governing body. (NRS 278.0235) Section 3 of this bill
21 applies these provisions to section 1.
22 Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to apply the definitions of certain terms
23 relating to planning and zoning to section 1.
