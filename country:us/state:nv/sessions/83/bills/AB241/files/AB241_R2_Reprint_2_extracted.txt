EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to housing; requiring the governing body of each
county and city to adopt an ordinance to authorize by-
right a multifamily housing development or mixed-use
development that includes a residential use on property
zoned for commercial use; declaring void certain county
or city ordinances; authorizing the State Land Registrar to
transfer, under certain circumstances, certain real property
owned by the State of Nevada to certain entities without
consideration; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Section 1 of this bill requires each governing body of a county or city to adopt
2 an ordinance that authorizes by-right a multifamily housing development or mixed-
3 use development that includes a residential use on property zoned for commercial
4 use. Section 1 also authorizes such an ordinance to establish certain standards and
5 requirements to qualify for such a by-right development. Section 1 further provides
6 that any such ordinance does not apply to any property: (1) that is zoned for or in
7 relation to an airport; or (2) within the region defined in the Tahoe Regional
8 Planning Compact. (NRS 277.200) Section 1 further provides that property zoned
9 for commercial use does not include property zoned for industrial use. Section 5 of
10 this bill declares void any ordinance, regulation or rule of a county or city which
11 conflicts with the provisions of this bill.
12 Existing law authorizes the governing body of a county or city to divide the
13 county, city or region into zoning districts of such number, shape and area as are
14 best suited to carry out certain purposes. Within a zoning district, the governing
15 body may regulate and restrict the erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration,
16 repair or use of buildings, structures or land. (NRS 278.250) Section 4 of this bill
-
*AB241_R2*
– 2 –
17 creates an exception to account for the requirement that the governing body of a
18 county or city adopt an ordinance to authorize by-right a multifamily housing
19 development or mixed-use development that includes a residential use on property
20 zoned for commercial use pursuant to section 1.
21 Existing law requires that an action or proceeding seeking judicial relief or
22 review from or with respect to any final action, decision or order of any governing
23 body of a county or city be commenced within 25 days after the date of filing of
24 notice of the final action, decision or order with the clerk or secretary of the
25 governing body. (NRS 278.0235) Section 3 of this bill applies these provisions to
26 section 1.
27 Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to apply the definitions of
28 certain terms relating to planning and zoning to section 1.
29 Existing law requires the State Land Registrar to execute on behalf of the State
30 of Nevada any lease, deed or other document by which any land or interest therein
31 owned by the State is conveyed. (NRS 321.003) Section 5.3 of this bill authorizes
32 the State Land Registrar to transfer title to certain real property owned by the State,
33 with certain restrictions, to Catholic Charities of Northern Nevada and the Reno-
34 Sparks Gospel Mission. Section 5.3 provides that such a transfer is conditioned
35 upon the Reno Redevelopment Agency entering into certain agreements with
36 Catholic Charities of Northern Nevada or the Reno-Sparks Gospel Mission. Section
37 5.3 further provides that such agreements must require the Reno Redevelopment
38 Agency to: (1) survey and generate a legal description for the portions of real
39 property that the State Land Registrar is authorized to transfer to each entity; and
40 (2) pay the costs relating to the transfer of the real properties. Section 5.5 of this
41 bill requires the deed for the real properties to include certain restrictions and
42 provide for the reversion of the title to the real properties under certain
43 circumstances.
