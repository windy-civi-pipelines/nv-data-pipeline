EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to housing; requiring the governing body of each county and city
to adopt an ordinance to authorize by-right a multifamily housing
development or mixed-use development that includes a residential use
on property zoned for commercial use; declaring void certain county or
city ordinances; authorizing the State Land Registrar to transfer,
under certain circumstances, certain real property owned by the
State of Nevada to certain entities without consideration; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Section 1 of this bill requires each governing body of a county or city to adopt an
2 ordinance that authorizes by-right a multifamily housing development or mixed-use
3 development that includes a residential use on property zoned for commercial use. Section 1
4 further provides that property zoned for commercial use does not include property zoned for
5 industrial use. Section 5 of this bill declares void any ordinance, regulation or rule of a county
6 or city which conflicts with the provisions of this bill.
7 Existing law authorizes the governing body of a county or city to divide the county, city
8 or region into zoning districts of such number, shape and area as are best suited to carry out
9 certain purposes. Within a zoning district, the governing body may regulate and restrict the
10 erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair or use of buildings, structures or land.
11 (NRS 278.250) Section 4 of this bill creates an exception to account for the requirement that
12 the governing body of a county or city adopt an ordinance to authorize by-right a multifamily
13 housing development or mixed-use development that includes a residential use on property
14 zoned for commercial use pursuant to section 1.
15 Existing law requires that an action or proceeding seeking judicial relief or review from
16 or with respect to any final action, decision or order of any governing body of a county or city
17 be commenced within 25 days after the date of filing of notice of the final action, decision or
18 order with the clerk or secretary of the governing body. (NRS 278.0235) Section 3 of this bill
19 applies these provisions to section 1.
20 Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to apply the definitions of certain terms
21 relating to planning and zoning to section 1.
22 Existing law requires the State Land Registrar to execute on behalf of the State of
23 Nevada any lease, deed or other document by which any land or interest therein owned
Senate Amendment No. 688 to Assembly Bill No. 241 First Reprint Page 4
24 by the State is conveyed. (NRS 321.003) Section 5.3 of this bill authorizes the State Land
25 Registrar to transfer title to certain real property owned by the State, with certain
26 restrictions, to Catholic Charities of Northern Nevada and the Reno-Sparks Gospel
27 Mission. Section 5.3 provides that such a transfer is conditioned upon the Reno
28 Redevelopment Agency entering into certain agreements with Catholic Charities of
29 Northern Nevada or the Reno-Sparks Gospel Mission. Section 5.3 further provides that
30 such agreements must require the Reno Redevelopment Agency to: (1) survey and
31 generate a legal description for the portions of real property that the State Land
32 Registrar is authorized to transfer to each entity; and (2) pay the costs relating to the
33 transfer of the real properties. Section 5.5 of this bill requires the deed for the real
34 properties to include certain restrictions and provide for the reversion of the title to the
35 real properties under certain circumstances.

AN ACT relating to housing; requiring the governing body of each county and city
to adopt an ordinance to authorize by-right a multifamily housing
development or mixed-use development that includes a residential use
on property zoned for commercial use; declaring void certain county or
city ordinances; authorizing the State Land Registrar to transfer,
under certain circumstances, certain real property owned by the
State of Nevada to certain entities without consideration; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Section 1 of this bill requires each governing body of a county or city to adopt an
2 ordinance that authorizes by-right a multifamily housing development or mixed-use
3 development that includes a residential use on property zoned for commercial use. Section 1
4 further provides that property zoned for commercial use does not include property zoned for
5 industrial use. Section 5 of this bill declares void any ordinance, regulation or rule of a county
6 or city which conflicts with the provisions of this bill.
7 Existing law authorizes the governing body of a county or city to divide the county, city
8 or region into zoning districts of such number, shape and area as are best suited to carry out
9 certain purposes. Within a zoning district, the governing body may regulate and restrict the
10 erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair or use of buildings, structures or land.
11 (NRS 278.250) Section 4 of this bill creates an exception to account for the requirement that
12 the governing body of a county or city adopt an ordinance to authorize by-right a multifamily
13 housing development or mixed-use development that includes a residential use on property
14 zoned for commercial use pursuant to section 1.
15 Existing law requires that an action or proceeding seeking judicial relief or review from

19 applies these provisions to section 1.
20 Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to apply the definitions of certain terms
21 relating to planning and zoning to section 1.
22 Existing law requires the State Land Registrar to execute on behalf of the State of
23 Nevada any lease, deed or other document by which any land or interest therein owned

Senate Amendment No. 688 to Assembly Bill No. 241 First Reprint Page 4
24 by the State is conveyed. (NRS 321.003) Section 5.3 of this bill authorizes the State Land
25 Registrar to transfer title to certain real property owned by the State, with certain
26 restrictions, to Catholic Charities of Northern Nevada and the Reno-Sparks Gospel
27 Mission. Section 5.3 provides that such a transfer is conditioned upon the Reno
28 Redevelopment Agency entering into certain agreements with Catholic Charities of
29 Northern Nevada or the Reno-Sparks Gospel Mission. Section 5.3 further provides that
30 such agreements must require the Reno Redevelopment Agency to: (1) survey and
31 generate a legal description for the portions of real property that the State Land
32 Registrar is authorized to transfer to each entity; and (2) pay the costs relating to the

34 properties to include certain restrictions and provide for the reversion of the title to the
35 real properties under certain circumstances.
