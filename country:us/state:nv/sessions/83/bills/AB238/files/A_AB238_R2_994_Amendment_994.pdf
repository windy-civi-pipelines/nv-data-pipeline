development and support of the film and creative media industry
in this State; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 [Existing law establishes a program for the issuance of transferable tax credits by the
2 Office of Economic Development to the production company of a motion picture or other
3 qualified production, based upon qualified direct production expenditures made for the
4 purchase of personal property or services from a Nevada business. (NRS 360.758-360.7598)
5 This bill revises provisions governing these transferable tax credits and enacts the Nevada
6 Studio Infrastructure Jobs and Workforce Training Act to authorize film infrastructure
7 transferable tax credits for qualified productions produced at the site of the Summerlin
8 Production Studios Project.
9 Sections 1-16 of this bill enact the Nevada Studio Jobs and Workforce Training Act,
10 which provides film infrastructure transferable tax credits for production companies located
11 within the Summerlin Production Studios Project, as defined in section 8. Section 9 requires
12 the Office of Economic Development to enter into a development agreement with the lead
13 participant of the Project to establish: (1) certain criteria that the Project is required to satisfy
14 in exchange for production companies located at the Project to be eligible for film
15 infrastructure transferable tax credits; and (2) certain requirements for new capital investment
16 in this State and the generation of direct production expenditures in this State, which the
17 Project must meet, with certain exceptions, to avoid penalties specified in section 9. Section
18 10: (1) authorizes production companies located at the Project to apply, on or after June 1,
19 2026, to the Office for film infrastructure transferable tax credits for qualified productions
20 produced, in whole or in part, at the Project; and (2) authorizes such credits to be used against
21 the modified business tax, insurance premium tax or gaming license fee, or any combination
22 of these taxes and fees. Section 11 establishes the qualified production expenditures which are
23 the basis for calculating the amount of film infrastructure transferable tax credits, including,
24 without limitation: (1) purchases and rentals of property or services from a Nevada business;
25 (2) wages and fringe benefits paid to employees who are Nevada residents or other personnel
26 who perform services in this State on the qualified production; (3) certain compensation paid
27 to producers in their capacity as producers; and (4) amounts paid to personal service
28 corporations for the services of certain persons on the qualified production. Section 12 of this
29 bill provides that the base amount of film infrastructure transferable tax credits is 30 percent
30 of the amount of qualified direct production expenditures calculated under section 11, with
31 certain reductions if the production company does not satisfy certain criteria for employing
32 Nevada residents as below-the-line personnel or employing or offering training or work
33 opportunities to members of traditionally underrepresented groups. Section 13: (1) limits the
34 total amount of film infrastructure transferable tax credits issued pursuant to sections 1-16 to
35 $95,000,000 for each fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2028; and (2) prohibits the
36 approval of an application for film infrastructure transferable tax credits if the application is
37 submitted in a fiscal year that begins on or after July 1, 2043. Section 14 requires a production
38 company to: (1) commence principal photography within a certain period of time after the
39 Office approves an application for a certificate of eligibility for film infrastructure transferable
40 tax credits; (2) complete the qualified production within 18 months after the date of
41 commencement of principal photography, except that the Office may extend this period for
42 not more than 6 months; and (3) submit certain required information within the required
43 period. Section 15 requires a production company to repay film infrastructure transferable tax
44 credits under certain circumstances. Section 15.7 requires the lead participant in the Project to
45 submit certain reports to the Governor, the Legislature and the Office, and requires the Office
46 to post such reports on its Internet website. Section 16 requires certain reports to be made to
47 the Legislature concerning film infrastructure transferable tax credits.
48 Sections 17-25 of this bill make various changes to the existing law governing the
49 noninfrastructure transferable tax credits for motion picture and other qualified productions.
50 (NRS 360.758-360.7598) Section 17 changes references to “extras” in a qualification
51 production to “background actors.” Section 18: (1) provides that digital media productions are
52 qualified productions for the purposes of eligibility for film infrastructure transferable tax
53 credits and noninfrastructure transferable tax credits; and (2) clarifies that media productions
54 solely produced for social media are not eligible for such transferable tax credits. Section 19
55 revises the criteria to be eligible for noninfrastructure transferable tax credits to be the same as

Senate Amendment No. 994 to Assembly Bill No. 238 Second Reprint Page 5
56 the criteria for film infrastructure transferable tax credits by: (1) removing the requirement
57 that a certain percentage of direct production expenditures be incurred in this State and,
58 instead, requiring that at least 50 percent of the total principal photography days take place in
59 this State or a certain amount of qualified direct production expenditures be incurred in this
60 State; and (2) requiring a production company to have a workforce plan that establishes
61 certain goals and provide to the Office a final assessment of whether the production company
62 met or made a good faith effort to meet those goals. Section 20 revises the expenditures and
63 costs that may serve as a basis for noninfrastructure transferable tax credits. Section 21: (1)
64 increases the base amount of transferable tax credits from 15 percent of the qualified direct
65 production expenditures to 30 percent of the qualified direct production expenditures, for an
66 application submitted in each fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2028, and ending before
67 July 1, 2043; and (2) provides for certain reductions to that base amount during that period.
68 Section 22 makes certain provisions of existing law relating to the calculation of
69 noninfrastructure transferable tax credits inapplicable for period beginning on July 1, 2028,
70 and ending on June 30, 2043. Section 23 temporarily increases from $10,000,000 to
71 $25,000,000 the total amount of noninfrastructure transferable tax credits for motion picture
72 and other qualified productions that may be issued under the existing program for each fiscal
73 year beginning on or after July 1, 2028, until June 30, 2043. Sections 24 and 25 make
74 conforming changes so that noninfrastructure transferable tax credits are administered and
75 reported in the same manner as film infrastructure transferable tax credits.
76 Section 15.3 requires the Clark County Board of County Commissioners to create a
77 production studio entertainment district for the purpose of enhancing early childhood
78 education opportunities, including prekindergarten, for children in the Clark County School
79 District. Under section 15.3, the boundaries of the district are required to be entirely within the
80 unincorporated areas of Clark County and include only parcels of land that are located within
81 the boundaries of the Summerlin Production Studios Project other than parcels on which a
82 business holding a gaming license is located. Section 15.3 requires certain taxes on transient
83 lodging, certain property taxes and certain sales and use taxes imposed in the district to be
84 pledged and distributed to the Clark County School District and used by the Clark County
85 School District solely for the purposes of prekindergarten programs in the Clark County
86 School District. Finally, section 15.3 requires the Clark County School District to submit
87 annual reports to the Office concerning the use of money distributed to Clark County School
88 District under section 15.3.
89 Sections 26-33 of this bill establish a program to provide grants to certain organizations
90 that provide education and vocational training for workforce development for the production
91 of motion pictures and other qualified productions. Section 31 establishes the Account for
92 Nevada Film, Media and Related Technology Education and Vocational Training for the
93 purpose of allocating money to certain entities and organizations that provide education and
94 vocational training for such workforce development. Sections 10 and 19 require a production
95 company that is issued transferable tax credits for a qualified production to pay to the Office
96 an amount of money equal to 1 percent of the amount of transferable tax credits issued to the
97 qualified production, and requires the Office to deposit that money with the State Treasurer
98 for credit to the Account. Section 32 creates and provides for the composition of the Board for
99 Nevada Film, Media and Related Technology Education and Vocational Training within the
100 Office of Economic Development. Section 33: (1) requires the Board to establish the
101 procedure for a person or entity to apply for a grant of money from the Account, the criteria to
102 be used to determine whether to approve an application for a grant from the Account to an
103 applicant and the requirements for reports by recipients of such grants concerning the use of
104 the grants; (2) prohibits the making of a grant from the Account unless the Board approves the
105 application for the grant; and (3) requires a recipient of a grant from the Account to adopt and
106 implement a community benefits program that satisfies certain requirements.] This bill
107 requires the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Commerce and Labor to conduct an
108 interim study during the 2025-2026 interim on the development and support of a
109 sustainable film and creative media industry in this State and requires the Committee to
110 submit a report of its findings and recommendations to the 2027 Legislative Session.
