to certain entities and organizations that provide
education and vocational training to develop a workforce
for the production of qualified productions in this State;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes a program for the issuance of transferable tax credits
2 by the Office of Economic Development to the production company of a motion
3 picture or other qualified production, based upon qualified direct production
4 expenditures made for the purchase of personal property or services from a Nevada
5 business. (NRS 360.758-360.7598) This bill revises provisions governing these
6 transferable tax credits and enacts the Nevada Studio Infrastructure Jobs and
7 Workforce Training Act to authorize film infrastructure transferable tax credits for
8 qualified productions produced at the site of the Summerlin Production Studios
9 Project.
10 Sections 1-16 of this bill enact the Nevada Studio Jobs and Workforce Training
11 Act, which provides film infrastructure transferable tax credits for production
12 companies located within the Summerlin Production Studios Project, as defined in
13 section 8. Section 9 requires the Office of Economic Development to enter into a
14 development agreement with the lead participant of the Project to establish: (1)
15 certain criteria that the Project is required to satisfy in exchange for production
16 companies located at the Project to be eligible for film infrastructure transferable
17 tax credits; and (2) certain requirements for new capital investment in this State and
18 the generation of qualified direct production expenditures in this State, which the
19 Project must meet, with certain exceptions, to avoid penalties specified in section 9.
20 Section 10 of this bill: (1) authorizes production companies located at the Project to
21 apply, on or after June 1, 2026, to the Office for film infrastructure transferable tax
22 credits for qualified productions produced, in whole or in part, at the Project; and
23 (2) authorizes such credits to be used against the modified business tax, insurance
24 premium tax or gaming license fee, or any combination of these taxes and fees.
25 Section 11 establishes the qualified production expenditures which are the basis for
26 calculating the amount of film infrastructure transferable tax credits, including,
27 without limitation: (1) purchases and rentals of property or services from a Nevada
28 business; (2) wages and fringe benefits paid to employees who are Nevada
29 residents or other personnel who perform services in this State on the qualified
30 production; (3) certain compensation paid to producers in their capacity as
31 producers; and (4) amounts paid to personal service corporations for the services of
32 certain persons on the qualified production. Section 12 of this bill provides that the
33 base amount of film infrastructure transferable tax credits is 30 percent of the
34 amount of qualified direct production expenditures calculated under section 11,
35 with certain reductions if the production company does not satisfy certain criteria
36 for employing Nevada residents as below-the-line personnel or employing or
37 offering training or work opportunities to members of traditionally
38 underrepresented groups. Section 13: (1) limits the total amount of film
39 infrastructure transferable tax credits issued pursuant to sections 1-16 to
40 $95,000,000 for each fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2028; and (2)
41 prohibits the approval of an application for film infrastructure transferable tax
42 credits if the application is submitted in a fiscal year that begins on or after July 1,
43 2043. Section 14 requires a production company to: (1) commence principal
44 photography within a certain period of time after the Office approves an application
45 for a certificate of eligibility for film infrastructure transferable tax credits; (2)
46 complete the qualified production within 18 months after the date of
47 commencement of principal photography, except that the Office may extend this
48 period for not more than 6 months; and (3) submit certain required information
-
*AB238_R1*

– 3 –
49 within the required period. Section 15 requires a production company to repay film
50 infrastructure transferable tax credits under certain circumstances. Section 15.7 of
51 this bill requires the lead participant in the Project to submit certain reports to the
52 Governor, the Legislature and the Office, and requires the Office to post such
53 reports on its Internet website. Section 16 requires certain reports to be made to the
54 Legislature concerning film infrastructure transferable tax credits.
55 Sections 17-25 of this bill make various changes to the existing law governing
56 the noninfrastructure transferable tax credits for motion picture and other qualified
57 productions. (NRS 360.758-360.7598) Section 17 changes references to “extras” in
58 a qualification production to “background actors.” Section 18: (1) provides that
59 digital media productions are qualified productions for the purposes of eligibility
60 for film infrastructure transferable tax credits and noninfrastructure transferable tax
61 credits; and (2) clarifies that media productions solely produced for social media
62 are not eligible for such transferable tax credits. Section 19 revises the criteria to be
63 eligible for noninfrastructure transferable tax credits to be the same as the criteria
64 for film infrastructure transferable tax credits by: (1) removing the requirement that
65 a certain percentage of direct production expenditures be incurred in this State and,
66 instead, requiring that at least 50 percent of the total principal photography days
67 take place in this State or a certain amount of qualified direct production
68 expenditures be incurred in this State; and (2) requiring a production company to
69 have a workforce plan that establishes certain goals and provide to the Office a
70 final assessment of whether the production company met or made a good faith
71 effort to meet those goals. Section 20 revises the expenditures and costs that may
72 serve as a basis for noninfrastructure transferable tax credits. Section 21: (1)
73 increases the base amount of transferable tax credits from 15 percent of the
74 qualified direct production expenditures to 30 percent of the qualified direct
75 production expenditures, for an application submitted in each fiscal year beginning
76 on or after July 1, 2028, and ending before July 1, 2043; and (2) provides for
77 certain reductions to that base amount during that period. Section 22 makes certain
78 provisions of existing law relating to the calculation of noninfrastructure
79 transferable tax credits inapplicable for period beginning on July 1, 2028, and
80 ending on June 30, 2043. Section 23 temporarily increases from $10,000,000 to
81 $25,000,000 the total amount of noninfrastructure transferable tax credits for
82 motion picture and other qualified productions that may be issued under the
83 existing program for each fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2028, until
84 June 30, 2043. Sections 24 and 25 make conforming changes so that
85 noninfrastructure transferable tax credits are administered and reported in the same
86 manner as film infrastructure transferable tax credits.
87 Section 15.3 of this bill requires the Clark County Board of County
88 Commissioners to create a production studio entertainment district for the purpose
89 of enhancing early childhood education opportunities, including prekindergarten,
90 for children in the Clark County School District. Under section 15.3, the
91 boundaries of the district are required to be entirely within the unincorporated areas
92 of Clark County and include only parcels of land that are located within the
93 boundaries of the Summerlin Production Studios Project other than parcels on
94 which a business holding a gaming license is located. Section 15.3 requires certain
95 taxes on transient lodging, certain property taxes and certain sales and use taxes
96 imposed in the district to be pledged and distributed to the Clark County School
97 District and used by the Clark County School District solely for the purposes of
98 prekindergarten programs in the Clark County School District. Finally, section 15.3
99 requires the Clark County School District to submit annual reports to the Office
100 concerning the use of money distributed to Clark County School District under
101 section 15.3.
102 Sections 26-33 of this bill establish a program to provide grants to certain
103 organizations that provide education and vocational training for workforce

104 development for the production of motion pictures and other qualified productions.
105 Section 31 establishes the Account for Nevada Film, Media and Related
106 Technology Education and Vocational Training for the purpose of allocating
107 money to certain entities and organizations that provide education and vocational
108 training for such workforce development. Sections 10 and 19 require a production
109 company that is issued transferable tax credits for a qualified production to pay to
110 the Office an amount of money equal to 1 percent of the amount of transferable tax
111 credits issued to the qualified production, and requires the Office to deposit that
112 money with the State Treasurer for credit to the Account. Section 32 creates and
113 provides for the composition of the Board for Nevada Film, Media and Related
114 Technology Education and Vocational Training within the Office of Economic
115 Development. Section 33: (1) requires the Board to establish the procedure for a
116 person or entity to apply for a grant of money from the Account, the criteria to be
117 used to determine whether to approve an application for a grant from the Account
118 to an applicant and the requirements for reports by recipients of such grants
119 concerning the use of the grants; (2) prohibits the making of a grant from the
120 Account unless the Board approves the application for the grant; and (3) requires a
121 recipient of a grant from the Account to adopt and implement a community benefits
122 program that satisfies certain requirements.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Sections 1 to 16, inclusive, of this act may be cited
2 as the Nevada Studio Infrastructure Jobs and Workforce Training
3 Act.
4 Sec. 2. 1. The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
5 (a) The Las Vegas Metropolitan Area is the largest metropolitan
6 area in this State and has a site available to be developed to create
7 large-scale facilities for the location of companies that produce
8 motion pictures, television programs and other qualified productions
9 in this State. The establishment of such a studio campus will create
10 jobs in Nevada’s creative industries and diversify the economy of
11 this State.
12 (b) The Las Vegas Metropolitan Area possesses unique
13 geographic, economic and resource advantages that make it
14 especially suitable for a project of this magnitude. Because of these
15 unique local conditions, it is necessary to enact a law of local and
16 special application to promote and secure the benefits of a large-
17 scale film and media production development in Southern Nevada
18 for the benefit of the entire State.
19 (c) Because of these special characteristics and circumstances in
20 Southern Nevada, a general law cannot be made applicable to
21 achieve the purposes of this Act and a law of local and special
22 application is necessary to promote and secure the advantages of the
23 local and special characteristics and circumstances within the Las
24 Vegas Metropolitan Area.
-
*AB238_R1*

1 2. The Legislature further finds and declares that the content
2 production industry has presented an ambitious and visionary plan
3 for all of Southern Nevada, which leverages the region’s unique
4 geographic assets, economic capabilities and infrastructural
5 advantages. The industry’s vision will promote the generation of
6 thousands of high-quality, high-paying jobs, billions of dollars in
7 incremental capital investments and billions more in new economic
8 output and ongoing spending. This plan transcends the development
9 of a mere studio complex, proposing instead a dynamic production
10 campus that is intended to serve as the nucleus for a robust,
11 sustainable industrial cluster. The Legislature recognizes that
12 realizing this vision depends fundamentally upon a collaborative
13 public-private partnership, wherein the State’s commitment,
14 provided through transferable tax credits, creates leverage that
15 significantly multiplies the benefits accruing to this State. In
16 entering this partnership, the Legislature affirms its clear and
17 unwavering expectation that if the industry benefits from the State’s
18 contribution of transferable tax credits, the industry’s promises will
19 be fulfilled, the outcomes articulated by the industry will be met or
20 exceeded, and the anticipated economic, fiscal and social benefits
21 driven by the industry will be fully realized.
22 3. The Legislature further finds and declares that the enactment
23 of this Act will achieve a bona fide public social and economic
24 purpose. The public investment made through the film infrastructure
25 transferable tax credits is intended to yield substantial benefits in
26 employment, workforce development and economic growth, and the
27 overall economic benefits expected to accrue from incremental
28 investment and the ongoing operations of the project will exceed
29 any adverse effect on public revenues from those tax incentives.
30 This Act, therefore, serves the public interest by fostering significant
31 new private investment, creating enduring jobs and educational
32 opportunities, and positioning Nevada as a leader in the content
33 creation industry while ensuring that the long-term gains to the
34 economy more than outweigh the State’s investment in the project.
35 Sec. 2.5. It is the intent of the Legislature, in enacting this Act,
36 to:
37 1. Promote the diversification of the economy of this State by
38 cultivating a thriving hub for content creation and production in
39 Nevada, which will establish Nevada as a nationally recognized
40 center for film, television and digital media production, thereby
41 broadening Nevada’s economic base beyond its traditional
42 industries and enhancing the State’s prominence in the creative
43 economy.
44 2. Provide an anchor for a new creative sector in Southern
45 Nevada through partnerships with global film and media companies

1 to develop and operate facilities for the production of film,
2 television and digital media productions and the involvement of
3 studio partners as anchor tenants to bring world-class expertise,
4 innovative technologies and global market access that will
5 accelerate the growth of a robust content creation industry in
6 Southern Nevada.
7 3. Support and promote workforce development in this State by
8 establishing and supporting education and vocational training
9 programs to prepare Nevada’s workforce for high-wage careers in
10 film, television and digital media production, equip Nevada’s
11 residents with in-demand skills and create pathways into the
12 industry, thereby generating thousands of new jobs for Nevadans
13 and building a skilled talent pool that sustains the State’s creative
14 sector for the long term.
15 Sec. 3. As used in sections 1 to 16, inclusive, of this act,
16 unless the context otherwise requires, the words and terms defined
17 in NRS 360.7581 to 360.7586, inclusive, as amended by sections 17

7 participant.
8 2. As the Executive Director of the Office deems necessary or

17 capital investment, not later than 2 years after the end of the period
18 for which the requirement for capital investment was not met, in an
19 amount necessary to satisfy the requirement for capital investment
20 that was not met. If the deficiency is not cured within that cure
21 period, the Office must impose a penalty on the Project, and record
22 a lien on undeveloped land within the Project, to secure payment of
23 such penalty, except that the amount of the penalty and lien must not
24 exceed 100 percent of the appraised value of the remaining
25 undeveloped land within the Project. A lien may not be recorded on
26 any completed portion of the Project and has priority over all other
27 liens other than liens for taxes and any lien securing a construction
28 loan. Any penalty, and the lien securing the payment of such
29 penalty, must be discharged as follows:
30 (a) If the requirement for capital investment which was not met
31 is satisfied not later than 1 year after the expiration of the cure
32 period, 90 percent of the amount of the penalty, and the lien
33 securing the payment of the penalty, must be discharged.
34 (b) If the requirement for capital investment which was not met
35 is satisfied more than 1 year, but not later than 2 years, after the
36 expiration of the cure period, 70 percent of the amount of the
37 penalty, and the lien securing the payment of the penalty, must be
38 discharged.
39 (c) If the requirement for capital investment which was not met
40 is satisfied more than 2 years, but not later than 3 years, after the
41 expiration of the cure period, 50 percent of the amount of the
42 penalty, and the lien securing the payment of the penalty, must be
43 discharged.
44 (d) If the requirement for capital investment which was not met
45 is satisfied more than 3 years, but not later than 4 years, after the
