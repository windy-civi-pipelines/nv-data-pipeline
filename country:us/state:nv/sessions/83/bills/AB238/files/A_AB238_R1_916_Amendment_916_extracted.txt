If this amendment is adopted, the Legislative Counsel᾿s Digest will be changed
as follows:
1 Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
2 Existing law establishes a program for the issuance of transferable tax credits by the
3 Office of Economic Development to the production company of a motion picture or other
4 qualified production, based upon qualified direct production expenditures made for the
5 purchase of personal property or services from a Nevada business. (NRS 360.758-360.7598)
6 This bill revises provisions governing these transferable tax credits and enacts the Nevada
7 Studio Infrastructure Jobs and Workforce Training Act to authorize film infrastructure
8 transferable tax credits for qualified productions produced at the site of the Summerlin
9 Production Studios Project.
10 Sections 1-16 of this bill enact the Nevada Studio Jobs and Workforce Training Act,
11 which provides film infrastructure transferable tax credits for production companies located
12 within the Summerlin Production Studios Project, as defined in section 8. Section 9 requires
13 the Office of Economic Development to enter into a development agreement with the lead
14 participant of the Project to establish: (1) certain criteria that the Project is required to satisfy
15 in exchange for production companies located at the Project to be eligible for film
16 infrastructure transferable tax credits; and (2) certain requirements for new capital investment
17 in this State and the generation of [qualified] direct production expenditures in this State,
18 which the Project must meet, with certain exceptions, to avoid penalties specified in section 9.
19 Section 10 : [of this bill:] (1) authorizes production companies located at the Project to apply,
20 on or after June 1, 2026, to the Office for film infrastructure transferable tax credits for
21 qualified productions produced, in whole or in part, at the Project; and (2) authorizes such
22 credits to be used against the modified business tax, insurance premium tax or gaming license
23 fee, or any combination of these taxes and fees. Section 11 establishes the qualified
24 production expenditures which are the basis for calculating the amount of film infrastructure
25 transferable tax credits, including, without limitation: (1) purchases and rentals of property or
26 services from a Nevada business; (2) wages and fringe benefits paid to employees who are
27 Nevada residents or other personnel who perform services in this State on the qualified
28 production; (3) certain compensation paid to producers in their capacity as producers; and (4)
29 amounts paid to personal service corporations for the services of certain persons on the
30 qualified production. Section 12 of this bill provides that the base amount of film
31 infrastructure transferable tax credits is 30 percent of the amount of qualified direct
32 production expenditures calculated under section 11, with certain reductions if the production
33 company does not satisfy certain criteria for employing Nevada residents as below-the-line
34 personnel or employing or offering training or work opportunities to members of traditionally
35 underrepresented groups. Section 13: (1) limits the total amount of film infrastructure
36 transferable tax credits issued pursuant to sections 1-16 to $95,000,000 for each fiscal year
37 beginning on or after July 1, 2028; and (2) prohibits the approval of an application for film
38 infrastructure transferable tax credits if the application is submitted in a fiscal year that begins
39 on or after July 1, 2043. Section 14 requires a production company to: (1) commence
40 principal photography within a certain period of time after the Office approves an application
41 for a certificate of eligibility for film infrastructure transferable tax credits; (2) complete the
42 qualified production within 18 months after the date of commencement of principal
43 photography, except that the Office may extend this period for not more than 6 months; and
44 (3) submit certain required information within the required period. Section 15 requires a
45 production company to repay film infrastructure transferable tax credits under certain
46 circumstances. Section 15.7 [of this bill] requires the lead participant in the Project to submit
47 certain reports to the Governor, the Legislature and the Office, and requires the Office to post
48 such reports on its Internet website. Section 16 requires certain reports to be made to the
49 Legislature concerning film infrastructure transferable tax credits.
Assembly Amendment No. 916 to Assembly Bill No. 238 First Reprint Page 4
50 Sections 17-25 of this bill make various changes to the existing law governing the
51 noninfrastructure transferable tax credits for motion picture and other qualified productions.
52 (NRS 360.758-360.7598) Section 17 changes references to “extras” in a qualification
53 production to “background actors.” Section 18: (1) provides that digital media productions are
54 qualified productions for the purposes of eligibility for film infrastructure transferable tax
55 credits and noninfrastructure transferable tax credits; and (2) clarifies that media productions
56 solely produced for social media are not eligible for such transferable tax credits. Section 19
57 revises the criteria to be eligible for noninfrastructure transferable tax credits to be the same as
58 the criteria for film infrastructure transferable tax credits by: (1) removing the requirement
59 that a certain percentage of direct production expenditures be incurred in this State and,
60 instead, requiring that at least 50 percent of the total principal photography days take place in
61 this State or a certain amount of qualified direct production expenditures be incurred in this
62 State; and (2) requiring a production company to have a workforce plan that establishes
63 certain goals and provide to the Office a final assessment of whether the production company
64 met or made a good faith effort to meet those goals. Section 20 revises the expenditures and
65 costs that may serve as a basis for noninfrastructure transferable tax credits. Section 21: (1)
66 increases the base amount of transferable tax credits from 15 percent of the qualified direct
67 production expenditures to 30 percent of the qualified direct production expenditures, for an
68 application submitted in each fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2028, and ending before
69 July 1, 2043; and (2) provides for certain reductions to that base amount during that period.
70 Section 22 makes certain provisions of existing law relating to the calculation of
71 noninfrastructure transferable tax credits inapplicable for period beginning on July 1, 2028,
72 and ending on June 30, 2043. Section 23 temporarily increases from $10,000,000 to
73 $25,000,000 the total amount of noninfrastructure transferable tax credits for motion picture
74 and other qualified productions that may be issued under the existing program for each fiscal
75 year beginning on or after July 1, 2028, until June 30, 2043. Sections 24 and 25 make
76 conforming changes so that noninfrastructure transferable tax credits are administered and
77 reported in the same manner as film infrastructure transferable tax credits.
78 Section 15.3 [of this bill] requires the Clark County Board of County Commissioners to
79 create a production studio entertainment district for the purpose of enhancing early childhood
80 education opportunities, including prekindergarten, for children in the Clark County School
81 District. Under section 15.3, the boundaries of the district are required to be entirely within
82 the unincorporated areas of Clark County and include only parcels of land that are located
83 within the boundaries of the Summerlin Production Studios Project other than parcels on
84 which a business holding a gaming license is located. Section 15.3 requires certain taxes on
85 transient lodging, certain property taxes and certain sales and use taxes imposed in the district
86 to be pledged and distributed to the Clark County School District and used by the Clark
87 County School District solely for the purposes of prekindergarten programs in the Clark
88 County School District. Finally, section 15.3 requires the Clark County School District to
89 submit annual reports to the Office concerning the use of money distributed to Clark County
90 School District under section 15.3.
91 Sections 26-33 of this bill establish a program to provide grants to certain organizations
92 that provide education and vocational training for workforce development for the production
93 of motion pictures and other qualified productions. Section 31 establishes the Account for
94 Nevada Film, Media and Related Technology Education and Vocational Training for the
95 purpose of allocating money to certain entities and organizations that provide education and
96 vocational training for such workforce development. Sections 10 and 19 require a production
97 company that is issued transferable tax credits for a qualified production to pay to the Office
98 an amount of money equal to 1 percent of the amount of transferable tax credits issued to the
99 qualified production, and requires the Office to deposit that money with the State Treasurer
100 for credit to the Account. Section 32 creates and provides for the composition of the Board for
101 Nevada Film, Media and Related Technology Education and Vocational Training within the
102 Office of Economic Development. Section 33: (1) requires the Board to establish the
Assembly Amendment No. 916 to Assembly Bill No. 238 First Reprint Page 5
103 procedure for a person or entity to apply for a grant of money from the Account, the criteria to
104 be used to determine whether to approve an application for a grant from the Account to an
105 applicant and the requirements for reports by recipients of such grants concerning the use of
106 the grants; (2) prohibits the making of a grant from the Account unless the Board approves the
107 application for the grant; and (3) requires a recipient of a grant from the Account to adopt and
108 implement a community benefits program that satisfies certain requirements.

Assembly Amendment No. 916 to Assembly Bill No. 238 First Reprint Page 3
If this amendment is adopted, the Legislative Counsel᾿s Digest will be changed
as follows:
1 Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
2 Existing law establishes a program for the issuance of transferable tax credits by the
3 Office of Economic Development to the production company of a motion picture or other
4 qualified production, based upon qualified direct production expenditures made for the
5 purchase of personal property or services from a Nevada business. (NRS 360.758-360.7598)
6 This bill revises provisions governing these transferable tax credits and enacts the Nevada
7 Studio Infrastructure Jobs and Workforce Training Act to authorize film infrastructure
8 transferable tax credits for qualified productions produced at the site of the Summerlin
9 Production Studios Project.
10 Sections 1-16 of this bill enact the Nevada Studio Jobs and Workforce Training Act,
11 which provides film infrastructure transferable tax credits for production companies located
12 within the Summerlin Production Studios Project, as defined in section 8. Section 9 requires
13 the Office of Economic Development to enter into a development agreement with the lead
14 participant of the Project to establish: (1) certain criteria that the Project is required to satisfy
15 in exchange for production companies located at the Project to be eligible for film
16 infrastructure transferable tax credits; and (2) certain requirements for new capital investment
17 in this State and the generation of [qualified] direct production expenditures in this State,
18 which the Project must meet, with certain exceptions, to avoid penalties specified in section 9.
19 Section 10 : [of this bill:] (1) authorizes production companies located at the Project to apply,
20 on or after June 1, 2026, to the Office for film infrastructure transferable tax credits for
21 qualified productions produced, in whole or in part, at the Project; and (2) authorizes such
22 credits to be used against the modified business tax, insurance premium tax or gaming license
23 fee, or any combination of these taxes and fees. Section 11 establishes the qualified
24 production expenditures which are the basis for calculating the amount of film infrastructure
25 transferable tax credits, including, without limitation: (1) purchases and rentals of property or
26 services from a Nevada business; (2) wages and fringe benefits paid to employees who are
27 Nevada residents or other personnel who perform services in this State on the qualified
28 production; (3) certain compensation paid to producers in their capacity as producers; and (4)
29 amounts paid to personal service corporations for the services of certain persons on the
30 qualified production. Section 12 of this bill provides that the base amount of film
31 infrastructure transferable tax credits is 30 percent of the amount of qualified direct
32 production expenditures calculated under section 11, with certain reductions if the production
33 company does not satisfy certain criteria for employing Nevada residents as below-the-line
34 personnel or employing or offering training or work opportunities to members of traditionally
35 underrepresented groups. Section 13: (1) limits the total amount of film infrastructure
36 transferable tax credits issued pursuant to sections 1-16 to $95,000,000 for each fiscal year
37 beginning on or after July 1, 2028; and (2) prohibits the approval of an application for film

40 principal photography within a certain period of time after the Office approves an application
41 for a certificate of eligibility for film infrastructure transferable tax credits; (2) complete the

50 Sections 17-25 of this bill make various changes to the existing law governing the
51 noninfrastructure transferable tax credits for motion picture and other qualified productions.
52 (NRS 360.758-360.7598) Section 17 changes references to “extras” in a qualification
53 production to “background actors.” Section 18: (1) provides that digital media productions are
54 qualified productions for the purposes of eligibility for film infrastructure transferable tax
55 credits and noninfrastructure transferable tax credits; and (2) clarifies that media productions
56 solely produced for social media are not eligible for such transferable tax credits. Section 19
57 revises the criteria to be eligible for noninfrastructure transferable tax credits to be the same as
58 the criteria for film infrastructure transferable tax credits by: (1) removing the requirement
59 that a certain percentage of direct production expenditures be incurred in this State and,
60 instead, requiring that at least 50 percent of the total principal photography days take place in
61 this State or a certain amount of qualified direct production expenditures be incurred in this
62 State; and (2) requiring a production company to have a workforce plan that establishes
63 certain goals and provide to the Office a final assessment of whether the production company
64 met or made a good faith effort to meet those goals. Section 20 revises the expenditures and
65 costs that may serve as a basis for noninfrastructure transferable tax credits. Section 21: (1)
66 increases the base amount of transferable tax credits from 15 percent of the qualified direct
67 production expenditures to 30 percent of the qualified direct production expenditures, for an
68 application submitted in each fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2028, and ending before
69 July 1, 2043; and (2) provides for certain reductions to that base amount during that period.
70 Section 22 makes certain provisions of existing law relating to the calculation of
71 noninfrastructure transferable tax credits inapplicable for period beginning on July 1, 2028,
72 and ending on June 30, 2043. Section 23 temporarily increases from $10,000,000 to
73 $25,000,000 the total amount of noninfrastructure transferable tax credits for motion picture
74 and other qualified productions that may be issued under the existing program for each fiscal
75 year beginning on or after July 1, 2028, until June 30, 2043. Sections 24 and 25 make
76 conforming changes so that noninfrastructure transferable tax credits are administered and
77 reported in the same manner as film infrastructure transferable tax credits.
78 Section 15.3 [of this bill] requires the Clark County Board of County Commissioners to
79 create a production studio entertainment district for the purpose of enhancing early childhood
80 education opportunities, including prekindergarten, for children in the Clark County School
81 District. Under section 15.3, the boundaries of the district are required to be entirely within
82 the unincorporated areas of Clark County and include only parcels of land that are located
83 within the boundaries of the Summerlin Production Studios Project other than parcels on
84 which a business holding a gaming license is located. Section 15.3 requires certain taxes on
85 transient lodging, certain property taxes and certain sales and use taxes imposed in the district
86 to be pledged and distributed to the Clark County School District and used by the Clark
87 County School District solely for the purposes of prekindergarten programs in the Clark
88 County School District. Finally, section 15.3 requires the Clark County School District to
89 submit annual reports to the Office concerning the use of money distributed to Clark County
90 School District under section 15.3.
91 Sections 26-33 of this bill establish a program to provide grants to certain organizations
92 that provide education and vocational training for workforce development for the production
93 of motion pictures and other qualified productions. Section 31 establishes the Account for
94 Nevada Film, Media and Related Technology Education and Vocational Training for the
95 purpose of allocating money to certain entities and organizations that provide education and
96 vocational training for such workforce development. Sections 10 and 19 require a production
97 company that is issued transferable tax credits for a qualified production to pay to the Office
98 an amount of money equal to 1 percent of the amount of transferable tax credits issued to the
99 qualified production, and requires the Office to deposit that money with the State Treasurer
100 for credit to the Account. Section 32 creates and provides for the composition of the Board for
101 Nevada Film, Media and Related Technology Education and Vocational Training within the
102 Office of Economic Development. Section 33: (1) requires the Board to establish the

Assembly Amendment No. 916 to Assembly Bill No. 238 First Reprint Page 5
103 procedure for a person or entity to apply for a grant of money from the Account, the criteria to
104 be used to determine whether to approve an application for a grant from the Account to an
105 applicant and the requirements for reports by recipients of such grants concerning the use of
106 the grants; (2) prohibits the making of a grant from the Account unless the Board approves the
107 application for the grant; and (3) requires a recipient of a grant from the Account to adopt and
108 implement a community benefits program that satisfies certain requirements.
