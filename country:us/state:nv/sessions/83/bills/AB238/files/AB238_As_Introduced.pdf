Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes a program for the issuance of transferable tax credits
2 by the Office of Economic Development to the production company of a motion
3 picture or other qualified production, based upon qualified direct production
4 expenditures made for the purchase of personal property or services from a Nevada
5 business. (NRS 360.758-360.7598) This bill revises provisions governing these
6 transferable tax credits and enacts the Nevada Studio Infrastructure Jobs and
7 Workforce Training Act to authorize film infrastructure transferable tax credits for
8 qualified productions produced at the site of the Summerlin Production Studios
9 Project.
10 Sections 1-16 of this bill enact the Nevada Studio Jobs and Workforce Training
11 Act, which provides film infrastructure transferable tax credits for production
12 companies located within the Summerlin Production Studios Project, as defined in
13 section 8. Section 9 requires the Office of Economic Development to enter into a
14 development agreement with the lead participant of the Project to establish certain
15 criteria that the Project is required to satisfy in exchange for production companies
16 located at the Project to be eligible for film infrastructure transferable tax credits.
17 Section 10 of this bill: (1) authorizes production companies located at the Project to
18 apply, on or after October 1, 2025, to the Office for film infrastructure transferable
19 tax credits for qualified productions produced, in whole or in part, at the Project;
20 and (2) authorizes such credits to be used against the modified business tax,
21 insurance premium tax or gaming license fee, or any combination of these taxes
22 and fees. Section 11 establish the qualified production expenditures which are the
23 basis for calculating the amount of film infrastructure transferable tax credits,
24 including, without limitation, purchases and rental of property or services from a
25 Nevada business, wages and fringe benefits paid to employees who are Nevada
26 residents for services on the qualified production, certain fees paid to producers and
27 amounts paid to personal service corporations for the services of certain persons on
28 the qualified production. Section 12 of this bill provides that the base amount of
29 film infrastructure transferable tax credits is 30 percent of the amount of qualified
30 direct production expenditures calculated under section 11, with certain reductions
31 if the production company does not satisfy certain criteria for employing Nevada
32 residents as below-the-line personnel or employing or offering training or work
33 opportunities to members of traditionally underrepresented groups. Section 13: (1)
34 limits the total amount of film infrastructure transferable tax credits issued pursuant
35 to sections 1-16 to $80,000,000 for each fiscal year beginning on or after July 1,
36 2028; and (2) prohibits the approval of an application for film infrastructure
37 transferable tax credits if the application is submitted in a fiscal year that begins
38 more than 15 years after the Project satisfies the capital investment requirements set
39 forth in the development agreement entered into pursuant to section 9. Section 14
40 requires a production company to commence principal photography within a certain
41 period of time after the Office issues a decision on the application for a certificate
42 of eligibility for film infrastructure transferable tax credits, complete the qualified
43 production within 18 months after the date of commencement of principal
44 photography and submit certain required information within the required period.
45 Section 15 requires a production company to repay film infrastructure transferable
46 tax credits under certain circumstances. Section 16 requires certain reports to be
47 made to the Legislature concerning film infrastructure transferable tax credits.
48 Sections 17-25 of this bill make various changes to the existing law governing
49 the noninfrastructure transferable tax credits for motion picture and other qualified
50 productions. (NRS 360.758-360.7598) Section 17 changes references to “extras” in
51 a qualification production to “background actors.” Section 18: (1) provides that
52 digital media productions are qualified productions for the purposes of eligibility
53 for film infrastructure transferable tax credits and noninfrastructure transferable tax
54 credits; and (2) clarifies that media productions solely produced for social media
-

55 are not eligible for such transferable tax credits. Section 19 revises the criteria to be
56 eligible for noninfrastructure transferable tax credits to be the same as the criteria
57 for film infrastructure transferable tax credits by: (1) requiring at least 50 percent of
58 the total principal photography days to take place in this State rather than requiring
59 a certain percentage of direct production expenditures to be incurred in this State;
60 and (2) requiring a production company to have a workforce plan that establishes
61 certain goals and provide to the Office a final assessment of whether the production
62 company met or made a good faith effort to meet those goals. Section 20 revises
63 the expenditures and costs that may serve as a basis for noninfrastructure
64 transferable tax credits. Section 21: (1) increases the base amount of transferable
65 tax credits from 15 percent of the qualified direct production expenditures to 30
66 percent of the qualified direct production expenditures, for an application submitted
67 in each fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2028, and ending before July 1,
68 2043; and (2) provides for certain reductions to that base amount during that period.
69 Section 22 makes certain provisions of existing law relating to the calculation of
70 noninfrastructure transferable tax credits inapplicable for period beginning on
71 July 1, 2028, and ending on June 30, 2043. Section 23 temporarily increases from
72 $10,000,000 to $15,000,000 the total amount of noninfrastructure transferable tax
73 credits for motion picture and other qualified productions that may be issued under
74 the existing program for each fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2028, until
75 June 30, 2043. Sections 24 and 25 make conforming changes so that
76 noninfrastructure transferable tax credits are administered and reported in the same
77 manner as film infrastructure transferable tax credits.
78 Sections 26-33 of this bill establish a program to provide grants to certain
79 organizations that provide education and vocational training for workforce
80 development for the production of motion pictures and other qualified productions.
81 Section 31 establishes the Account for Nevada Film, Media and Related
82 Technology Education and Vocational Training for the purpose of allocating
83 money to certain entities and organizations that provide education and vocational
84 training for such workforce development. Sections 10 and 19 require a production
85 company that is issued transferable tax credits for a qualified production to pay to
86 the Office an amount of money equal to 1 percent of the amount of transferable tax
87 credits issued to the qualified production, and requires the Office to deposit that
88 money with the State Treasurer for credit to the Account. Section 32 creates and
89 provides for the composition of the Board for Nevada Film, Media and Related
90 Technology Education and Vocational Training within the Office of Economic
91 Development. Section 33: (1) requires the Board to establish the procedure for a
92 person or entity to apply for a grant of money from the Account, the criteria to be
93 used to determine whether to approve an application for a grant from the Account
94 to an applicant and the requirements for reports by recipients of such grants
95 concerning the use of the grants; (2) prohibits the making of a grant from the
96 Account unless the Board approves the application for the grant; and (3) requires a
97 recipient of a grant from the Account to adopt and implement a community benefits
98 program that satisfies certain requirements.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Sections 1 to 16, inclusive, of this act may be cited

-
*AB238*

– 4 –
1 (a) The Las Vegas Metropolitan Area is the largest metropolitan
2 area in this State and has a site available to be developed to create
3 large-scale facilities for the location of companies that produce
4 motion pictures and other qualified productions in this State, which
5 will create jobs in that industry in this State and diversify the
6 economy of this State.
7 (b) Because the Las Vegas Metropolitan Area is appropriate and
8 suitable for the development of a large-scale project to develop
9 large-scale facilities for the location of companies that produce
10 motion pictures and other qualified productions and has all the
11 special attributes, conditions and resources that are essential to
12 support such facilities, it is necessary to enact a law of local and
13 special application to promote, develop and secure the advantages of
14 the local and special characteristics and circumstances within the
15 Las Vegas Metropolitan Area, which are found nowhere else in this
16 State, and to benefit the residents of the entire State.
17 (c) Therefore, given that a law of local and special application is
18 necessary to promote, develop and secure the advantages of the
19 local and special characteristics and circumstances within the Las
20 Vegas area, which are found nowhere else within this State, and
21 given that such a law is necessary to benefit the residents of that
22 local and special area, a general law cannot be made applicable to
23 the purposes, objects, powers, rights, privileges, immunities,
24 liabilities, duties and disabilities set forth in this Act.
25 2. The Legislature further finds and declares that, as a result of
26 the construction of large-scale facilities for the production of motion
27 pictures and other qualified productions in this State and the direct,
28 indirect and induced economic benefits of such productions in this
29 State, the enactment of this Act will achieve a bona fide social or
30 economic purpose and the economic benefits of the issuance of the
31 transferable tax credits to encourage the location of large-scale
32 facilities for the production of motion pictures and other qualified
33 productions in this State are expected to exceed any adverse effect
34 of the transferable tax credits on the revenue raised for the provision
35 of services to the public by the State or a local government.
