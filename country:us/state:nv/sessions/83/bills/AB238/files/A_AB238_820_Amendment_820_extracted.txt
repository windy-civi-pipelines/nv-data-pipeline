Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes a program for the issuance of transferable tax credits by the
2 Office of Economic Development to the production company of a motion picture or other
Assembly Amendment No. 820 to Assembly Bill No. 238 Page 4
3 qualified production, based upon qualified direct production expenditures made for the
4 purchase of personal property or services from a Nevada business. (NRS 360.758-360.7598)
5 This bill revises provisions governing these transferable tax credits and enacts the Nevada
6 Studio Infrastructure Jobs and Workforce Training Act to authorize film infrastructure
7 transferable tax credits for qualified productions produced at the site of the Summerlin
8 Production Studios Project.
9 Sections 1-16 of this bill enact the Nevada Studio Jobs and Workforce Training Act,
10 which provides film infrastructure transferable tax credits for production companies located
11 within the Summerlin Production Studios Project, as defined in section 8. Section 9 requires
12 the Office of Economic Development to enter into a development agreement with the lead
13 participant of the Project to establish : (1) certain criteria that the Project is required to satisfy
14 in exchange for production companies located at the Project to be eligible for film
15 infrastructure transferable tax credits [.] ; and (2) certain requirements for new capital
16 investment in this State and the generation of qualified direct production expenditures
17 in this State, which the Project must meet, with certain exceptions, to avoid penalties
18 specified in section 9. Section 10 of this bill: (1) authorizes production companies located at
19 the Project to apply, on or after [October 1, 2025,] June 1, 2026, to the Office for film
20 infrastructure transferable tax credits for qualified productions produced, in whole or in part,
21 at the Project; and (2) authorizes such credits to be used against the modified business tax,
22 insurance premium tax or gaming license fee, or any combination of these taxes and fees.
23 Section 11 establishes the qualified production expenditures which are the basis for
24 calculating the amount of film infrastructure transferable tax credits, including, without
25 limitation [,] : (1) purchases and [rental] rentals of property or services from a Nevada
26 business [,] ; (2) wages and fringe benefits paid to employees who are Nevada residents [for]
27 or other personnel who perform services in this State on the qualified production [,] ; (3)
28 certain [fees] compensation paid to producers in their capacity as producers; and (4)
29 amounts paid to personal service corporations for the services of certain persons on the
30 qualified production. Section 12 of this bill provides that the base amount of film
31 infrastructure transferable tax credits is 30 percent of the amount of qualified direct
32 production expenditures calculated under section 11, with certain reductions if the production
33 company does not satisfy certain criteria for employing Nevada residents as below-the-line
34 personnel or employing or offering training or work opportunities to members of traditionally
35 underrepresented groups. Section 13: (1) limits the total amount of film infrastructure
36 transferable tax credits issued pursuant to sections 1-16 to [$80,000,000] $95,000,000 for
37 each fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2028; and (2) prohibits the approval of an
38 application for film infrastructure transferable tax credits if the application is submitted in a
39 fiscal year that begins [more than 15 years after the Project satisfies the capital investment
40 requirements set forth in the development agreement entered into pursuant to section 9.] on or
41 after July 1, 2043. Section 14 requires a production company to : (1) commence principal
42 photography within a certain period of time after the Office [issues a decision on the]
43 approves an application for a certificate of eligibility for film infrastructure transferable tax
44 credits [,] ; (2) complete the qualified production within 18 months after the date of
45 commencement of principal photography , except that the Office may extend this period
46 for not more than 6 months; and (3) submit certain required information within the required
47 period. Section 15 requires a production company to repay film infrastructure transferable tax
48 credits under certain circumstances. Section 15.7 of this bill requires the lead participant in
49 the Project to submit certain reports to the Governor, the Legislature and the Office,
50 and requires the Office to post such reports on its Internet website. Section 16 requires
51 certain reports to be made to the Legislature concerning film infrastructure transferable tax
52 credits.
53 Sections 17-25 of this bill make various changes to the existing law governing the
54 noninfrastructure transferable tax credits for motion picture and other qualified productions.
55 (NRS 360.758-360.7598) Section 17 changes references to “extras” in a qualification
56 production to “background actors.” Section 18: (1) provides that digital media productions are
57 qualified productions for the purposes of eligibility for film infrastructure transferable tax
58 credits and noninfrastructure transferable tax credits; and (2) clarifies that media productions
59 solely produced for social media are not eligible for such transferable tax credits. Section 19
60 revises the criteria to be eligible for noninfrastructure transferable tax credits to be the same as
61 the criteria for film infrastructure transferable tax credits by: (1) removing the requirement
Assembly Amendment No. 820 to Assembly Bill No. 238 Page 5
62 that a certain percentage of direct production expenditures be incurred in this State and,
63 instead, requiring that at least 50 percent of the total principal photography days [to] take
64 place in this State [rather than requiring a certain percentage of direct production expenditures
65 to be incurred in this State;] or a certain amount of qualified direct production
66 expenditures be incurred in this State; and (2) requiring a production company to have a
67 workforce plan that establishes certain goals and provide to the Office a final assessment of
68 whether the production company met or made a good faith effort to meet those goals. Section
69 20 revises the expenditures and costs that may serve as a basis for noninfrastructure
70 transferable tax credits. Section 21: (1) increases the base amount of transferable tax credits
71 from 15 percent of the qualified direct production expenditures to 30 percent of the qualified
72 direct production expenditures, for an application submitted in each fiscal year beginning on
73 or after July 1, 2028, and ending before July 1, 2043; and (2) provides for certain reductions to
74 that base amount during that period. Section 22 makes certain provisions of existing law
75 relating to the calculation of noninfrastructure transferable tax credits inapplicable for period
76 beginning on July 1, 2028, and ending on June 30, 2043. Section 23 temporarily increases
77 from $10,000,000 to $25,000,000 the total amount of noninfrastructure transferable tax credits
78 for motion picture and other qualified productions that may be issued under the existing
79 program for each fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2028, until June 30, 2043. Sections
80 24 and 25 make conforming changes so that noninfrastructure transferable tax credits are
81 administered and reported in the same manner as film infrastructure transferable tax credits.
82 Section 15.3 of this bill requires the Clark County Board of County Commissioners
83 to create a production studio entertainment district for the purpose of enhancing early
84 childhood education opportunities, including prekindergarten, for children in the Clark
85 County School District. Under section 15.3, the boundaries of the district are required to
86 be entirely within the unincorporated areas of Clark County and include only parcels of
87 land that are located within the boundaries of the Summerlin Production Studios
88 Project other than parcels on which a business holding a gaming license is located.
89 Section 15.3 requires certain taxes on transient lodging, certain property taxes and
90 certain sales and use taxes imposed in the district to be pledged and distributed to the
91 Clark County School District and used by the Clark County School District solely for
92 the purposes of prekindergarten programs in the Clark County School District. Finally,
93 section 15.3 requires the Clark County School District to submit annual reports to the
94 Office concerning the use of money distributed to Clark County School District under
95 section 15.3.
96 Sections 26-33 of this bill establish a program to provide grants to certain organizations
97 that provide education and vocational training for workforce development for the production
98 of motion pictures and other qualified productions. Section 31 establishes the Account for
99 Nevada Film, Media and Related Technology Education and Vocational Training for the
100 purpose of allocating money to certain entities and organizations that provide education and
101 vocational training for such workforce development. Sections 10 and 19 require a production
102 company that is issued transferable tax credits for a qualified production to pay to the Office
103 an amount of money equal to 1 percent of the amount of transferable tax credits issued to the
104 qualified production, and requires the Office to deposit that money with the State Treasurer
105 for credit to the Account. Section 32 creates and provides for the composition of the Board for
106 Nevada Film, Media and Related Technology Education and Vocational Training within the
107 Office of Economic Development. Section 33: (1) requires the Board to establish the
108 procedure for a person or entity to apply for a grant of money from the Account, the criteria to
109 be used to determine whether to approve an application for a grant from the Account to an
110 applicant and the requirements for reports by recipients of such grants concerning the use of
111 the grants; (2) prohibits the making of a grant from the Account unless the Board approves the
112 application for the grant; and (3) requires a recipient of a grant from the Account to adopt and
113 implement a community benefits program that satisfies certain requirements.
Assembly Amendment No. 820 to Assembly Bill No. 238 Page 6
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Sections 1 to 16, inclusive, of this act may be cited as the Nevada
2 Studio Infrastructure Jobs and Workforce Training Act.
3 Sec. 2. 1. The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
4 (a) The Las Vegas Metropolitan Area is the largest metropolitan area in this
5 State and has a site available to be developed to create large-scale facilities for the
6 location of companies that produce motion pictures , television programs and
7 other qualified productions in this State . [, which] The establishment of such a
8 studio campus will create jobs in [that industry in this State] Nevada’s creative
9 industries and diversify the economy of this State.
10 (b) [Because the] The Las Vegas Metropolitan Area [is appropriate and
11 suitable for the development of a large-scale project to develop large-scale facilities
12 for the location of companies that produce motion pictures and other qualified
13 productions and has all the special attributes, conditions and resources that are
14 essential to support such facilities,] possesses unique geographic, economic and
15 resource advantages that make it especially suitable for a project of this
16 magnitude. Because of these unique local conditions, it is necessary to enact a
17 law of local and special application to promote [, develop] and secure the
18 [advantages of the local and special characteristics and circumstances within the
19 Las Vegas Metropolitan Area, which are found nowhere else in this State, and to]
20 benefits of a large-scale film and media production development in Southern
21 Nevada for the benefit [the residents] of the entire State.
22 (c) [Therefore, given that] Because of these special characteristics and
23 circumstances in Southern Nevada, a general law cannot be made applicable to
24 achieve the purposes of this Act and a law of local and special application is
25 necessary to promote [, develop] and secure the advantages of the local and special
26 characteristics and circumstances within the Las Vegas [area, which are found
27 nowhere else within this State, and given that such a law is necessary to benefit the
28 residents of that local and special area, a general law cannot be made applicable to
29 the purposes, objects, powers, rights, privileges, immunities, liabilities, duties and
30 disabilities set forth in this Act.] Metropolitan Area.
31 2. The Legislature further finds and declares that the content production
32 industry has presented an ambitious and visionary plan for all of Southern
33 Nevada, which leverages the region’s unique geographic assets, economic
34 capabilities and infrastructural advantages. The industry’s vision will promote
35 the generation of thousands of high-quality, high-paying jobs, billions of
36 dollars in incremental capital investments and billions more in new economic
37 output and ongoing spending. This plan transcends the development of a mere
38 studio complex, proposing instead a dynamic production campus that is
39 intended to serve as the nucleus for a robust, sustainable industrial cluster.
40 The Legislature recognizes that realizing this vision depends fundamentally
41 upon a collaborative public-private partnership, wherein the State’s
42 commitment, provided through transferable tax credits, creates leverage that
43 significantly multiplies the benefits accruing to this State. In entering this
44 partnership, the Legislature affirms its clear and unwavering expectation that
45 if the industry benefits from the State’s contribution of transferable tax
46 credits, the industry’s promises will be fulfilled, the outcomes articulated by
47 the industry will be met or exceeded, and the anticipated economic, fiscal and
48 social benefits driven by the industry will be fully realized.
Assembly Amendment No. 820 to Assembly Bill No. 238 Page 7
1 3. The Legislature further finds and declares that [, as a result of the
2 construction of large-scale facilities for the production of motion pictures and other
3 qualified productions in this State and the direct, indirect and induced economic
4 benefits of such productions in this State,] the enactment of this Act will achieve a
5 bona fide public social [or] and economic purpose . [and the economic benefits of
6 the issuance of the transferable tax credits to encourage the location of large-scale
7 facilities for the production of motion pictures and other qualified productions in
8 this State are expected to exceed any adverse effect of the transferable tax credits
9 on the revenue raised for the provision of services to the public by the State or a
10 local government.] The public investment made through the film infrastructure
11 transferable tax credits is intended to yield substantial benefits in employment,
12 workforce development and economic growth, and the overall economic
13 benefits expected to accrue from incremental investment and the ongoing
14 operations of the project will exceed any adverse effect on public revenues
15 from those tax incentives. This Act, therefore, serves the public interest by
16 fostering significant new private investment, creating enduring jobs and
17 educational opportunities, and positioning Nevada as a leader in the content
18 creation industry while ensuring that the long-term gains to the economy more
19 than outweigh the State’s investment in the project.
20 Sec. 2.5. It is the intent of the Legislature, in enacting this Act, to:
21 1. Promote the diversification of the economy of this State by cultivating
22 a thriving hub for content creation and production in Nevada, which will
23 establish Nevada as a nationally recognized center for film, television and
24 digital media production, thereby broadening Nevada’s economic base beyond
25 its traditional industries and enhancing the State’s prominence in the creative
26 economy.
27 2. Provide an anchor for a new creative sector in Southern Nevada
28 through partnerships with global film and media companies to develop and
29 operate facilities for the production of film, television and digital media
30 productions and the involvement of studio partners as anchor tenants to bring
31 world-class expertise, innovative technologies and global market access that
32 will accelerate the growth of a robust content creation industry in Southern
33 Nevada.
34 3. Support and promote workforce development in this State by
35 establishing and supporting education and vocational training programs to
36 prepare Nevada’s workforce for high-wage careers in film, television and
37 digital media production, equip Nevada’s residents with in-demand skills and
38 create pathways into the industry, thereby generating thousands of new jobs
39 for Nevadans and building a skilled talent pool that sustains the State’s
40 creative sector for the long term.
41 Sec. 3. As used in sections 1 to 16, inclusive, of this act, unless the context
42 otherwise requires, the words and terms defined in NRS 360.7581 to 360.7586,

16 payment of the penalty, must be discharged.
17 (e) If the requirement for capital investment which was not met is satisfied
18 more than 4 years, but not later than 5 years, after the expiration of the cure

33 expenditures generated through the production of qualified productions, in
34 whole or in part, at the site of the Project, by $150,000,000; and
35 (c) Multiplying the percentage calculated pursuant to paragraph (b) by
36 the amount calculated pursuant to paragraph (a).
37  Any penalty paid pursuant to this subsection must be applied to reduce the
38 amount of any penalty imposed pursuant to subsection 5.

27 subsection 3, 4 or 5 if, upon written request of the lead participant, the Office
28 determines that the failure to meet a requirement for which a penalty may be
29 imposed was caused by extraordinary circumstances beyond the control of the

27 or other personnel who perform services in this State on the qualified production [,] ; (3)
28 certain [fees] compensation paid to producers in their capacity as producers; and (4)
29 amounts paid to personal service corporations for the services of certain persons on the
30 qualified production. Section 12 of this bill provides that the base amount of film
31 infrastructure transferable tax credits is 30 percent of the amount of qualified direct
32 production expenditures calculated under section 11, with certain reductions if the production
33 company does not satisfy certain criteria for employing Nevada residents as below-the-line
34 personnel or employing or offering training or work opportunities to members of traditionally
35 underrepresented groups. Section 13: (1) limits the total amount of film infrastructure
36 transferable tax credits issued pursuant to sections 1-16 to [$80,000,000] $95,000,000 for
37 each fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2028; and (2) prohibits the approval of an
38 application for film infrastructure transferable tax credits if the application is submitted in a

40 requirements set forth in the development agreement entered into pursuant to section 9.] on or
41 after July 1, 2043. Section 14 requires a production company to : (1) commence principal
42 photography within a certain period of time after the Office [issues a decision on the]
43 approves an application for a certificate of eligibility for film infrastructure transferable tax
44 credits [,] ; (2) complete the qualified production within 18 months after the date of
45 commencement of principal photography , except that the Office may extend this period
46 for not more than 6 months; and (3) submit certain required information within the required
47 period. Section 15 requires a production company to repay film infrastructure transferable tax
48 credits under certain circumstances. Section 15.7 of this bill requires the lead participant in
49 the Project to submit certain reports to the Governor, the Legislature and the Office,
50 and requires the Office to post such reports on its Internet website. Section 16 requires
51 certain reports to be made to the Legislature concerning film infrastructure transferable tax
52 credits.
53 Sections 17-25 of this bill make various changes to the existing law governing the
54 noninfrastructure transferable tax credits for motion picture and other qualified productions.
55 (NRS 360.758-360.7598) Section 17 changes references to “extras” in a qualification
56 production to “background actors.” Section 18: (1) provides that digital media productions are
57 qualified productions for the purposes of eligibility for film infrastructure transferable tax
58 credits and noninfrastructure transferable tax credits; and (2) clarifies that media productions
59 solely produced for social media are not eligible for such transferable tax credits. Section 19
60 revises the criteria to be eligible for noninfrastructure transferable tax credits to be the same as
61 the criteria for film infrastructure transferable tax credits by: (1) removing the requirement

Assembly Amendment No. 820 to Assembly Bill No. 238 Page 5
62 that a certain percentage of direct production expenditures be incurred in this State and,
63 instead, requiring that at least 50 percent of the total principal photography days [to] take
64 place in this State [rather than requiring a certain percentage of direct production expenditures
65 to be incurred in this State;] or a certain amount of qualified direct production
66 expenditures be incurred in this State; and (2) requiring a production company to have a
67 workforce plan that establishes certain goals and provide to the Office a final assessment of
68 whether the production company met or made a good faith effort to meet those goals. Section
69 20 revises the expenditures and costs that may serve as a basis for noninfrastructure
70 transferable tax credits. Section 21: (1) increases the base amount of transferable tax credits
71 from 15 percent of the qualified direct production expenditures to 30 percent of the qualified
72 direct production expenditures, for an application submitted in each fiscal year beginning on
73 or after July 1, 2028, and ending before July 1, 2043; and (2) provides for certain reductions to
74 that base amount during that period. Section 22 makes certain provisions of existing law
75 relating to the calculation of noninfrastructure transferable tax credits inapplicable for period
76 beginning on July 1, 2028, and ending on June 30, 2043. Section 23 temporarily increases
77 from $10,000,000 to $25,000,000 the total amount of noninfrastructure transferable tax credits
78 for motion picture and other qualified productions that may be issued under the existing
79 program for each fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2028, until June 30, 2043. Sections
80 24 and 25 make conforming changes so that noninfrastructure transferable tax credits are
81 administered and reported in the same manner as film infrastructure transferable tax credits.
82 Section 15.3 of this bill requires the Clark County Board of County Commissioners
83 to create a production studio entertainment district for the purpose of enhancing early
84 childhood education opportunities, including prekindergarten, for children in the Clark
85 County School District. Under section 15.3, the boundaries of the district are required to
86 be entirely within the unincorporated areas of Clark County and include only parcels of
87 land that are located within the boundaries of the Summerlin Production Studios
88 Project other than parcels on which a business holding a gaming license is located.
89 Section 15.3 requires certain taxes on transient lodging, certain property taxes and
90 certain sales and use taxes imposed in the district to be pledged and distributed to the
91 Clark County School District and used by the Clark County School District solely for
92 the purposes of prekindergarten programs in the Clark County School District. Finally,
93 section 15.3 requires the Clark County School District to submit annual reports to the
94 Office concerning the use of money distributed to Clark County School District under
95 section 15.3.
96 Sections 26-33 of this bill establish a program to provide grants to certain organizations
97 that provide education and vocational training for workforce development for the production
98 of motion pictures and other qualified productions. Section 31 establishes the Account for
99 Nevada Film, Media and Related Technology Education and Vocational Training for the
100 purpose of allocating money to certain entities and organizations that provide education and
101 vocational training for such workforce development. Sections 10 and 19 require a production
102 company that is issued transferable tax credits for a qualified production to pay to the Office
103 an amount of money equal to 1 percent of the amount of transferable tax credits issued to the
104 qualified production, and requires the Office to deposit that money with the State Treasurer
105 for credit to the Account. Section 32 creates and provides for the composition of the Board for
106 Nevada Film, Media and Related Technology Education and Vocational Training within the
107 Office of Economic Development. Section 33: (1) requires the Board to establish the
108 procedure for a person or entity to apply for a grant of money from the Account, the criteria to
109 be used to determine whether to approve an application for a grant from the Account to an
110 applicant and the requirements for reports by recipients of such grants concerning the use of
111 the grants; (2) prohibits the making of a grant from the Account unless the Board approves the
112 application for the grant; and (3) requires a recipient of a grant from the Account to adopt and
113 implement a community benefits program that satisfies certain requirements.

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Sections 1 to 16, inclusive, of this act may be cited as the Nevada
2 Studio Infrastructure Jobs and Workforce Training Act.
3 Sec. 2. 1. The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
4 (a) The Las Vegas Metropolitan Area is the largest metropolitan area in this
5 State and has a site available to be developed to create large-scale facilities for the
6 location of companies that produce motion pictures , television programs and
7 other qualified productions in this State . [, which] The establishment of such a
8 studio campus will create jobs in [that industry in this State] Nevada’s creative
9 industries and diversify the economy of this State.
10 (b) [Because the] The Las Vegas Metropolitan Area [is appropriate and
11 suitable for the development of a large-scale project to develop large-scale facilities
12 for the location of companies that produce motion pictures and other qualified
13 productions and has all the special attributes, conditions and resources that are
14 essential to support such facilities,] possesses unique geographic, economic and
15 resource advantages that make it especially suitable for a project of this
16 magnitude. Because of these unique local conditions, it is necessary to enact a
17 law of local and special application to promote [, develop] and secure the
18 [advantages of the local and special characteristics and circumstances within the
19 Las Vegas Metropolitan Area, which are found nowhere else in this State, and to]
20 benefits of a large-scale film and media production development in Southern
21 Nevada for the benefit [the residents] of the entire State.
22 (c) [Therefore, given that] Because of these special characteristics and
23 circumstances in Southern Nevada, a general law cannot be made applicable to
24 achieve the purposes of this Act and a law of local and special application is
25 necessary to promote [, develop] and secure the advantages of the local and special
26 characteristics and circumstances within the Las Vegas [area, which are found
27 nowhere else within this State, and given that such a law is necessary to benefit the
28 residents of that local and special area, a general law cannot be made applicable to
29 the purposes, objects, powers, rights, privileges, immunities, liabilities, duties and
30 disabilities set forth in this Act.] Metropolitan Area.
31 2. The Legislature further finds and declares that the content production
32 industry has presented an ambitious and visionary plan for all of Southern
33 Nevada, which leverages the region’s unique geographic assets, economic
34 capabilities and infrastructural advantages. The industry’s vision will promote
35 the generation of thousands of high-quality, high-paying jobs, billions of
36 dollars in incremental capital investments and billions more in new economic
37 output and ongoing spending. This plan transcends the development of a mere
38 studio complex, proposing instead a dynamic production campus that is
39 intended to serve as the nucleus for a robust, sustainable industrial cluster.
40 The Legislature recognizes that realizing this vision depends fundamentally
41 upon a collaborative public-private partnership, wherein the State’s
42 commitment, provided through transferable tax credits, creates leverage that
43 significantly multiplies the benefits accruing to this State. In entering this
44 partnership, the Legislature affirms its clear and unwavering expectation that
45 if the industry benefits from the State’s contribution of transferable tax
46 credits, the industry’s promises will be fulfilled, the outcomes articulated by
47 the industry will be met or exceeded, and the anticipated economic, fiscal and
48 social benefits driven by the industry will be fully realized.

Assembly Amendment No. 820 to Assembly Bill No. 238 Page 7
1 3. The Legislature further finds and declares that [, as a result of the
2 construction of large-scale facilities for the production of motion pictures and other
3 qualified productions in this State and the direct, indirect and induced economic
4 benefits of such productions in this State,] the enactment of this Act will achieve a
5 bona fide public social [or] and economic purpose . [and the economic benefits of
6 the issuance of the transferable tax credits to encourage the location of large-scale
7 facilities for the production of motion pictures and other qualified productions in
8 this State are expected to exceed any adverse effect of the transferable tax credits
9 on the revenue raised for the provision of services to the public by the State or a
10 local government.] The public investment made through the film infrastructure
11 transferable tax credits is intended to yield substantial benefits in employment,
12 workforce development and economic growth, and the overall economic
13 benefits expected to accrue from incremental investment and the ongoing
14 operations of the project will exceed any adverse effect on public revenues
15 from those tax incentives. This Act, therefore, serves the public interest by
16 fostering significant new private investment, creating enduring jobs and
17 educational opportunities, and positioning Nevada as a leader in the content
18 creation industry while ensuring that the long-term gains to the economy more
19 than outweigh the State’s investment in the project.
20 Sec. 2.5. It is the intent of the Legislature, in enacting this Act, to:
21 1. Promote the diversification of the economy of this State by cultivating
22 a thriving hub for content creation and production in Nevada, which will
23 establish Nevada as a nationally recognized center for film, television and
24 digital media production, thereby broadening Nevada’s economic base beyond
25 its traditional industries and enhancing the State’s prominence in the creative
26 economy.
27 2. Provide an anchor for a new creative sector in Southern Nevada
28 through partnerships with global film and media companies to develop and
29 operate facilities for the production of film, television and digital media
30 productions and the involvement of studio partners as anchor tenants to bring
31 world-class expertise, innovative technologies and global market access that
32 will accelerate the growth of a robust content creation industry in Southern
33 Nevada.
34 3. Support and promote workforce development in this State by
35 establishing and supporting education and vocational training programs to
36 prepare Nevada’s workforce for high-wage careers in film, television and
37 digital media production, equip Nevada’s residents with in-demand skills and
38 create pathways into the industry, thereby generating thousands of new jobs
39 for Nevadans and building a skilled talent pool that sustains the State’s
40 creative sector for the long term.

42 otherwise requires, the words and terms defined in NRS 360.7581 to 360.7586,
