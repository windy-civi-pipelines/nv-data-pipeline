occupancy.] real property. (BDR 15-729)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to [crimes;] real property; making it unlawful to procure or offer
a false or forged written rental agreement for purposes of committing
the crime of housebreaking or unlawful occupancy; expanding the
crime of unlawful occupancy under certain circumstances;
defining the terms “squatter” and “tenant” for certain purposes
relating to summary proceedings for obtaining possession of real
property, a dwelling or dwelling unit, a recreational vehicle or a
mobile home; reducing the period for seeking reentry of a dwelling
and the return of personal property contained therein under
certain circumstances; providing penalties; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law makes it a crime to engage in housebreaking or unlawful occupancy.
2 (NRS 205.0813, 205.0817) Under existing law, a person commits the crime of housebreaking
3 if the person forcibly enters an uninhabited or vacant dwelling with the intent to take up
4 residence or provide residency to another and knows or has reason to believe that such
5 residency is without the permission of the owner of the dwelling or an authorized
6 representative of the owner. (NRS 205.0813) Under existing law, a person commits the crime
7 of unlawful occupancy if the person takes up residence in an uninhabited or vacant dwelling
8 and knows or has reason to believe that such residency is without permission of the owner of
9 the dwelling or an authorized representative of the owner. (NRS 205.0817) [This] Sections 1
10 and 2 of this bill [makes] make it unlawful to intentionally procure or offer a false or forged
11 written rental agreement for purposes of committing the crime of housebreaking or unlawful
12 occupancy. Section 2 also expands the crime of unlawful occupancy to make it unlawful
13 to take up residence in a dwelling, regardless of whether it is uninhabited or vacant, if a
14 person knows or has reason to believe that such residency is without permission of the
15 owner of the dwelling or an authorized representative of the owner.
16 Existing law sets forth a procedure by which: (1) an owner of a dwelling that is the
17 object of a housebreaking or unlawful occupancy may immediately retake possession
18 and change the locks on the dwelling; and (2) an unlawful or unauthorized occupant
19 who has been locked out of such a dwelling may seek reentry. (NRS 40.412, 40.416)
20 Section 2.3 of this bill defines the terms “squatter” and “tenant” for certain purposes
21 relating to summary proceedings for obtaining possession of real property, a dwelling or
Senate Amendment No. 338 to Senate Bill No. 202 Page 4
22 dwelling unit, a recreational vehicle or a mobile home and provides that a squatter is not
23 a tenant for such purposes. Section 2.5 of this bill reduces the period for which: (1) an
24 unlawful or unauthorized occupant who has been locked out of a dwelling has the right
25 to contest the matter by filing a verified complaint for reentry; and (2) the owner of the
26 dwelling is required to store the personal property of the unlawful or unauthorized
27 occupant before disposing of it. Section 2.7 of this bill clarifies the process by which an
28 unlawful or unauthorized occupant who has been locked out may seek the return of the
29 personal property of the occupant.

occupancy.] real property. (BDR 15-729)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to [crimes;] real property; making it unlawful to procure or offer
a false or forged written rental agreement for purposes of committing
the crime of housebreaking or unlawful occupancy; expanding the
crime of unlawful occupancy under certain circumstances;
defining the terms “squatter” and “tenant” for certain purposes
relating to summary proceedings for obtaining possession of real
property, a dwelling or dwelling unit, a recreational vehicle or a
mobile home; reducing the period for seeking reentry of a dwelling
and the return of personal property contained therein under
certain circumstances; providing penalties; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law makes it a crime to engage in housebreaking or unlawful occupancy.
2 (NRS 205.0813, 205.0817) Under existing law, a person commits the crime of housebreaking
3 if the person forcibly enters an uninhabited or vacant dwelling with the intent to take up
4 residence or provide residency to another and knows or has reason to believe that such
5 residency is without the permission of the owner of the dwelling or an authorized
6 representative of the owner. (NRS 205.0813) Under existing law, a person commits the crime
7 of unlawful occupancy if the person takes up residence in an uninhabited or vacant dwelling
8 and knows or has reason to believe that such residency is without permission of the owner of
9 the dwelling or an authorized representative of the owner. (NRS 205.0817) [This] Sections 1
10 and 2 of this bill [makes] make it unlawful to intentionally procure or offer a false or forged
11 written rental agreement for purposes of committing the crime of housebreaking or unlawful
12 occupancy. Section 2 also expands the crime of unlawful occupancy to make it unlawful
13 to take up residence in a dwelling, regardless of whether it is uninhabited or vacant, if a
14 person knows or has reason to believe that such residency is without permission of the
15 owner of the dwelling or an authorized representative of the owner.
16 Existing law sets forth a procedure by which: (1) an owner of a dwelling that is the
17 object of a housebreaking or unlawful occupancy may immediately retake possession
18 and change the locks on the dwelling; and (2) an unlawful or unauthorized occupant
19 who has been locked out of such a dwelling may seek reentry. (NRS 40.412, 40.416)
20 Section 2.3 of this bill defines the terms “squatter” and “tenant” for certain purposes
21 relating to summary proceedings for obtaining possession of real property, a dwelling or

Senate Amendment No. 338 to Senate Bill No. 202 Page 4
22 dwelling unit, a recreational vehicle or a mobile home and provides that a squatter is not
23 a tenant for such purposes. Section 2.5 of this bill reduces the period for which: (1) an
24 unlawful or unauthorized occupant who has been locked out of a dwelling has the right
25 to contest the matter by filing a verified complaint for reentry; and (2) the owner of the
26 dwelling is required to store the personal property of the unlawful or unauthorized
27 occupant before disposing of it. Section 2.7 of this bill clarifies the process by which an
28 unlawful or unauthorized occupant who has been locked out may seek the return of the
29 personal property of the occupant.

1 Sec. 2.7. NRS 40.416 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 40.416 1. If the owner of a dwelling or an authorized representative of the

8 (a) The facts of the lockout by the owner of the dwelling or the authorized
9 representative of the owner; and

11 3. The court shall, after notice to both parties, hold a trial on the occupant’s
12 verified complaint for reentry not later than 10 judicial days after the date on which
13 the occupant files the verified complaint for reentry.
14 4. If the court finds that an unjustified lockout has occurred, the court must
15 issue a writ of restitution, restoring possession of the dwelling and any personal
16 property to the occupant.
17 5. A party may appeal from the court’s judgment at the trial on the verified
18 complaint for reentry in the same manner as a party may appeal a judgment in an
19 action for forcible detainer.
20 6. If the owner of the dwelling or the person on whom a writ of restitution is
21 served fails to immediately comply with the writ or later disobeys the writ, the
22 failure is grounds for contempt of court against the owner or the person on whom
23 the writ was served, under chapter 22 of NRS.
24 7. This section does not affect:
25 (a) The right of any party to pursue a separate cause of action under this
