5 in part, by the Federal Government, the repealed provisions, as they existed on the

8 whole or in part: (1) a person who previously had the right to bring a civil action in
9 a district court of the United States is authorized to bring such an action in a court
10 of competent jurisdiction of this State; and (2) any federal funding for special
11 education is to be used for identifying and evaluating pupils with disabilities and
12 providing services to such pupils. Section 1 additionally authorizes the Department
13 of Education to adopt regulations to carry out the provisions of section 1 and
14 provides that the provisions of this bill are not to be construed as to affect any
15 requirements concerning pupils with disabilities set forth under existing state law.
