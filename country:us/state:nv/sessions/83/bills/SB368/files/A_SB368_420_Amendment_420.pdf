Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 The federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act governs how states and public
2 agencies provide early intervention, special education and related services to pupils with
3 disabilities. (20 U.S.C. §§ 1400 et seq.) Section 1 of this bill provides in skeleton form that, if
4 the Act [is] or any regulations adopted pursuant thereto are repealed , in whole or in part,
5 by the Federal Government, the [provisions of the Act,] repealed provisions, as they existed
6 on [July 1, 2025,] the effective date of this bill, continue to apply in this State. Section 1
7 additionally provides that, if the Act [is] or any regulations adopted pursuant thereto is
8 repealed, in whole or in part: (1) a person who previously had the right to bring a civil action
9 in a district court of the United States is authorized to bring such an action in a court of
10 competent jurisdiction of this State [.] ; and (2) any federal funding for special education is
11 to be used for identifying and evaluating pupils with disabilities and providing services
12 to such pupils. Section 1 additionally authorizes the Department of Education to adopt
13 regulations to carry out the provisions of section 1 and provides that the provisions of
14 this bill are not to be construed as to affect any requirements concerning pupils with
15 disabilities set forth under existing state law. Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming
16 change to indicate the proper placement of section 1 in the Nevada Revised Statutes.
