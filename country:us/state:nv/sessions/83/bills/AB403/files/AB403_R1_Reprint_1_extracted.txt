EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to taxes on retail sales; providing for the
submission to the voters of the question of whether the
Sales and Use Tax Act of 1955 should be amended to
exempt from the taxes the amount of any allowance
against the selling price given by a retailer for the value of
a used portable electronic taken in trade on the purchase
of another portable electronic under certain
circumstances; providing for the same exemption from
certain analogous taxes if the voters approve this
amendment to the Sales and Use Tax Act of 1955; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 The nonadministrative provisions of the Sales and Use Tax Act of 1955 (part of
2 chapter 372 of NRS) were approved by the voters by a referendum and therefore
3 may not be amended, annulled, repealed, set aside, suspended or in any way made
4 inoperative except by the direct vote of the people. (Nev. Const. Art. 19, § 1)
5 Sections 2-9 of this bill require the submission of a question to the voters at the
6 2026 General Election of whether the Sales and Use Tax Act of 1955 should be
7 amended to provide an exemption for the amount of any allowance against the
8 selling price given by a retailer for the value of a used portable electronic taken in
9 trade on the purchase of another portable electronic, if the amount of the allowance
10 is known and provided in full to the customer at the time of purchase and stated on
11 the sales receipt and the trade-in and purchase occur as part of a single,
12 contemporaneous transaction. Sections 10-13 of this bill amend the Local School
13 Support Tax Law (chapter 374 of NRS) to provide an identical exemption. These
-
*AB403_R1*
– 2 –
14 tax exemptions become effective on January 1, 2027, and expire by limitation on
15 December 31, 2050, only if the voters approve the amendment to the Sales and Use
16 Tax Act of 1955 at the General Election in 2026.
17 Any amendment to the Local School Support Tax Law also applies to other
18 sales and use taxes imposed under existing law. (NRS 354.705, 374A.020,
19 376A.060, 377.040, 377A.030, 377B.110, 543.600 and various special and local
20 acts) Therefore, if the voters approve the exemption proposed by this bill, from
21 January 1, 2027, through December 31, 2050, the exemption will apply to all sales
22 and use taxes currently contemplated under existing law.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. The Legislature hereby finds that each exemption
2 provided by this act from any excise tax on the sale, storage, use or
3 consumption of tangible personal property sold at retail:
4 1. Will achieve a bona fide social or economic purpose and that
5 the benefits of the exemption are expected to exceed any adverse
6 effect of the exemption on the provision of services to the public by
7 the State or a local government that would otherwise receive
8 revenue from the tax from which the exemption would be granted;
9 and
10 2. Will not impair adversely the ability of the State or a local
11 government to pay, when due, all interest and principal on any
12 outstanding bonds or any other obligations for which revenue from
13 the tax from which the exemption would be granted was pledged.
14 Sec. 2. At the General Election on November 3, 2026, a
15 proposal must be submitted to the registered voters of this State to
16 amend the Sales and Use Tax Act, which was enacted by the 47th

18 the Governor in 1955, and subsequently approved by the people of
19 this State at the General Election held on November 6, 1956.
20 Sec. 3. At the time and in the manner provided by law, the
21 Secretary of State shall transmit the proposed act to the several
22 county clerks, and the county clerks shall cause it to be published
23 and posted as provided by law.

providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 The nonadministrative provisions of the Sales and Use Tax Act of 1955 (part of
2 chapter 372 of NRS) were approved by the voters by a referendum and therefore
3 may not be amended, annulled, repealed, set aside, suspended or in any way made
4 inoperative except by the direct vote of the people. (Nev. Const. Art. 19, § 1)
5 Sections 2-9 of this bill require the submission of a question to the voters at the
6 2026 General Election of whether the Sales and Use Tax Act of 1955 should be
7 amended to provide an exemption for the amount of any allowance against the
8 selling price given by a retailer for the value of a used portable electronic taken in
9 trade on the purchase of another portable electronic, if the amount of the allowance
10 is known and provided in full to the customer at the time of purchase and stated on
11 the sales receipt and the trade-in and purchase occur as part of a single,
12 contemporaneous transaction. Sections 10-13 of this bill amend the Local School
13 Support Tax Law (chapter 374 of NRS) to provide an identical exemption. These
-
*AB403_R1*

– 2 –
14 tax exemptions become effective on January 1, 2027, and expire by limitation on
15 December 31, 2050, only if the voters approve the amendment to the Sales and Use
16 Tax Act of 1955 at the General Election in 2026.
17 Any amendment to the Local School Support Tax Law also applies to other
18 sales and use taxes imposed under existing law. (NRS 354.705, 374A.020,
19 376A.060, 377.040, 377A.030, 377B.110, 543.600 and various special and local
20 acts) Therefore, if the voters approve the exemption proposed by this bill, from
21 January 1, 2027, through December 31, 2050, the exemption will apply to all sales
22 and use taxes currently contemplated under existing law.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. The Legislature hereby finds that each exemption
2 provided by this act from any excise tax on the sale, storage, use or
3 consumption of tangible personal property sold at retail:

5 the benefits of the exemption are expected to exceed any adverse
6 effect of the exemption on the provision of services to the public by
7 the State or a local government that would otherwise receive
8 revenue from the tax from which the exemption would be granted;
9 and
10 2. Will not impair adversely the ability of the State or a local
11 government to pay, when due, all interest and principal on any
12 outstanding bonds or any other obligations for which revenue from
13 the tax from which the exemption would be granted was pledged.

19 this State at the General Election held on November 6, 1956.
20 Sec. 3. At the time and in the manner provided by law, the
21 Secretary of State shall transmit the proposed act to the several
22 county clerks, and the county clerks shall cause it to be published
23 and posted as provided by law.
