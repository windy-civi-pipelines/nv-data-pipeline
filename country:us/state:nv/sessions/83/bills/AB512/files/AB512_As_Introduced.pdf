AN ACT relating to insurance; including certain insurance that
provides for certain payments for certain legal services
and certain expenses in the definition of “casualty
insurance”; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the regulation of insurance and insurers in this State
2 by the Commissioner of Insurance. (Title 57 of NRS) Existing law establishes
3 various kinds of insurance and prohibits the Commissioner from authorizing an
4 insurer to transact in this State any kind of insurance other than the kinds of
5 insurance established under existing law. (NRS 680A.080, 681A.010-681A.080)
6 Among the various kinds of insurance established under existing law is casualty
7 insurance, which existing law defines to include vehicle insurance, liability
8 insurance, workers’ compensation and employer’s liability insurance and various
9 other particular types of casualty insurance. (NRS 681A.020) This bill expands the
10 definition of casualty insurance to include legal expenses insurance, which, under
11 this bill, means insurance against any liability to pay or reimburse the costs of any
12 specific legal services or specific legal expenses, other than the cost of any fee paid
13 to an attorney for the overhead and administrative costs of the attorney. As such,
14 under this bill, legal expenses insurance is included among the various types of
15 insurance that a casualty insurer may be authorized to transact and subject to any
16 applicable provision of existing law governing casualty insurance.
