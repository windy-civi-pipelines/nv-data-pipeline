EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to insurance; establishing the policies of insurance to which
certain requirements relating to coverage for legal defense costs
are applicable; including certain insurance that provides for certain
payments for certain legal services and certain expenses in the
definition of “casualty insurance”; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits an insurer from issuing or renewing a policy of liability
2 insurance that contains a provision that: (1) reduces the limit of liability stated in the
3 policy by the costs of defense, legal costs and fees and other expenses for claims; or (2)
4 otherwise limits the availability of coverage for the costs of defense, legal costs and fees
5 and other expenses for claims. (NRS 679A.210) Existing regulations provide that these
6 prohibitions apply to a policy of casualty insurance that: (1) provides insurance against
7 legal liability arising from the ownership or operation of a motor vehicle; (2) provides
8 insurance against legal liability arising from the ownership of housing occupied by the
9 owner of the housing; (3) is a policy of commercial general liability insurance; (4) is a
10 policy of commercial automobile insurance; or (5) provides insurance covering the
11 professional liability of certain providers of health care. Existing regulations also exempt
12 from the applicability of the prohibitions: (1) a risk retention group; (2) captive
13 insurance that does not cover third-party liability; and (3) a nonadmitted insurer.
14 (Sections 2 and 3 of Adopted Reg. of Comm’r of Insurance, LCB File No. R029-23)
15 Section 1 of this bill codifies those provisions of existing regulations into statute.
16 Existing law provides for the regulation of insurance and insurers in this State by the
17 Commissioner of Insurance. (Title 57 of NRS) Existing law establishes various kinds of
18 insurance and prohibits the Commissioner from authorizing an insurer to transact in this State
19 any kind of insurance other than the kinds of insurance established under existing law. (NRS
20 680A.080, 681A.010-681A.080) Among the various kinds of insurance established under
21 existing law is casualty insurance, which existing law defines to include vehicle insurance,
22 liability insurance, workers’ compensation and employer’s liability insurance and various
23 other particular types of casualty insurance. (NRS 681A.020) [This] Section 2 of this bill
24 expands the definition of casualty insurance to include legal expenses insurance, which, under
25 [this bill,] section 2, means insurance against any liability [to pay or reimburse] of a person
26 or entity for the costs of any specific legal services or specific legal expenses [, other than the
27 cost of any fee paid to an attorney for the overhead and administrative costs of the attorney.]

Assembly Amendment No. 192 to Assembly Bill No. 512 Page 4
28 and which pays or reimburses the person for the costs of the services or expenses.
29 Section 2 excludes certain arrangements for prepaid legal services from the definition of
30 legal expenses insurance. As such, under [this bill,] section 2, legal expenses insurance is
31 included among the various types of insurance that a casualty insurer may be authorized to
32 transact and subject to any applicable provision of existing law governing casualty insurance.
