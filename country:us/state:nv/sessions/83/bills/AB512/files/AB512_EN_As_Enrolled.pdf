Assembly Bill No. 512–Committee
on Commerce and Labor
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to insurance; establishing the policies of insurance
to which certain requirements relating to coverage for legal
defense costs are applicable; including certain insurance that
provides for certain payments for certain legal services and
certain expenses in the definition of “casualty insurance”; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law prohibits an insurer from issuing or renewing a policy of liability
insurance that contains a provision that: (1) reduces the limit of liability stated in
the policy by the costs of defense, legal costs and fees and other expenses for
claims; or (2) otherwise limits the availability of coverage for the costs of defense,
legal costs and fees and other expenses for claims. (NRS 679A.210) Existing
regulations provide that these prohibitions apply to a policy of casualty insurance
that: (1) provides insurance against legal liability arising from the ownership or
operation of a motor vehicle; (2) provides insurance against legal liability arising
from the ownership of housing occupied by the owner of the housing; (3) is a
policy of commercial general liability insurance; (4) is a policy of commercial
automobile insurance; or (5) provides insurance covering the professional liability
of certain providers of health care. Existing regulations also exempt from the
applicability of the prohibitions: (1) a risk retention group; (2) captive insurance
that does not cover third-party liability; and (3) a nonadmitted insurer. (Sections 2
and 3 of Adopted Reg. of Comm’r of Insurance, LCB File No. R029-23) Section 1
of this bill codifies those provisions of existing regulations into statute.
Existing law provides for the regulation of insurance and insurers in this State
by the Commissioner of Insurance. (Title 57 of NRS) Existing law establishes
various kinds of insurance and prohibits the Commissioner from authorizing an
insurer to transact in this State any kind of insurance other than the kinds of
insurance established under existing law. (NRS 680A.080, 681A.010-681A.080)
Among the various kinds of insurance established under existing law is casualty
insurance, which existing law defines to include vehicle insurance, liability
insurance, workers’ compensation and employer’s liability insurance and various
other particular types of casualty insurance. (NRS 681A.020) Section 2 of this bill
expands the definition of casualty insurance to include legal expenses insurance,
which, under section 2, means insurance against any liability of a person or entity
for the costs of any specific legal services or specific legal expenses and which
pays or reimburses the person for the costs of the services or expenses. Section 2
excludes certain arrangements for prepaid legal services from the definition of legal
expenses insurance. As such, under section 2, legal expenses insurance is included
among the various types of insurance that a casualty insurer may be authorized to
transact and subject to any applicable provision of existing law governing casualty
insurance.
