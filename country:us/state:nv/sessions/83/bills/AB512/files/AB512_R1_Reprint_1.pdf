EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to insurance; establishing the policies of insurance
to which certain requirements relating to coverage for
legal defense costs are applicable; including certain
insurance that provides for certain payments for certain
legal services and certain expenses in the definition of
“casualty insurance”; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits an insurer from issuing or renewing a policy of liability
2 insurance that contains a provision that: (1) reduces the limit of liability stated in
3 the policy by the costs of defense, legal costs and fees and other expenses for
4 claims; or (2) otherwise limits the availability of coverage for the costs of defense,
5 legal costs and fees and other expenses for claims. (NRS 679A.210) Existing
6 regulations provide that these prohibitions apply to a policy of casualty insurance
7 that: (1) provides insurance against legal liability arising from the ownership or
8 operation of a motor vehicle; (2) provides insurance against legal liability arising
9 from the ownership of housing occupied by the owner of the housing; (3) is a
10 policy of commercial general liability insurance; (4) is a policy of commercial
11 automobile insurance; or (5) provides insurance covering the professional liability
12 of certain providers of health care. Existing regulations also exempt from the
13 applicability of the prohibitions: (1) a risk retention group; (2) captive insurance
14 that does not cover third-party liability; and (3) a nonadmitted insurer. (Sections 2
15 and 3 of Adopted Reg. of Comm’r of Insurance, LCB File No. R029-23) Section 1
16 of this bill codifies those provisions of existing regulations into statute.
17 Existing law provides for the regulation of insurance and insurers in this State
18 by the Commissioner of Insurance. (Title 57 of NRS) Existing law establishes
19 various kinds of insurance and prohibits the Commissioner from authorizing an
20 insurer to transact in this State any kind of insurance other than the kinds of
-

21 insurance established under existing law. (NRS 680A.080, 681A.010-681A.080)
22 Among the various kinds of insurance established under existing law is casualty
23 insurance, which existing law defines to include vehicle insurance, liability
24 insurance, workers’ compensation and employer’s liability insurance and various
25 other particular types of casualty insurance. (NRS 681A.020) Section 2 of this bill
26 expands the definition of casualty insurance to include legal expenses insurance,
27 which, under section 2, means insurance against any liability of a person or entity
28 for the costs of any specific legal services or specific legal expenses and which
29 pays or reimburses the person for the costs of the services or expenses. Section 2
30 excludes certain arrangements for prepaid legal services from the definition of legal
31 expenses insurance. As such, under section 2, legal expenses insurance is included
32 among the various types of insurance that a casualty insurer may be authorized to
33 transact and subject to any applicable provision of existing law governing casualty
34 insurance.
