EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to educational personnel; authorizing a member or
veteran of the Armed Forces of the United States who has
received certification as an instructor in the Junior
Reserve Officers’ Training Corps program to obtain a
license to teach in the same manner as a person who has
completed the alternative route to licensure program of
this State; providing that a person licensed in such a
manner may only receive an endorsement to teach pupils
enrolled in the Junior Reserve Officers’ Training Corps
program; requiring school districts to consider
certification as an instructor in the Junior Reserve
Officers’ Training Corps program to satisfy qualifications
for certain positions of employment applied for by a
member or veteran of the Armed Forces of the United
States; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Commission on Professional Standards in Education
2 to adopt regulations relating to the qualifications to obtain a license to teach in this
3 State. (NRS 391.019) Existing law requires the regulations adopted by the
4 Commission to: (1) include the qualifications for licensing teachers and
5 administrators pursuant to an alternative route to licensure; and (2) provide for the
6 issuance of a regular license to a person who completes the education and training
7 required under the alternative route to licensure and who satisfies all other
8 requirements for licensure. (NRS 391.019) Section 1 of this bill authorizes a
9 member or veteran of the Armed Forces of the United States who has received
-
*SB175_R1*
– 2 –
10 certification as an instructor in the Junior Reserve Officers’ Training Corps
11 program, including, without limitation, a temporary, provisional or advanced
12 certification, to obtain a license in this State as if the member or veteran has
13 completed the alternative route to licensure program in this State. Section 1
14 additionally provides that a person licensed in such a manner may only receive an
15 endorsement to teach pupils enrolled in the Junior Reserve Officers’ Training Corps
16 program.
17 Existing law requires an applicant for a license as a teacher or administrator to
18 submit with his or her application proof that the applicant has satisfactorily
19 completed a course of study and training approved by the Commission. Existing
20 law exempts a person who received education and training pursuant to an
21 alternative route to licensure from this requirement. (NRS 391.037) Section 2 of
22 this bill also exempts a person who applies for a license as a member or veteran of
23 the Armed Forces of the United States who has received certification, including,
24 without limitation, a temporary, provisional or advanced certification, as an
25 instructor in the Junior Reserve Officers’ Training Corps program from this
26 requirement.
27 Existing law requires school districts to consider the Joint Services Transcript
28 or a similar document of a veteran as credit towards such training, experience or
29 licensure required for certain skilled positions of employment in that school district.
30 (NRS 391.115) Section 3 of this bill applies these provisions to a person who is a
31 member of the Armed Forces of the United States in addition to veterans. Section 3
32 also adds certification as an instructor in the Junior Reserve Officers’ Training
33 Corps program, as described in section 1, as a specific certification on a Joint
34 Services Transcript or a similar document for which credit must be provided by a
35 school district.

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to educational personnel; authorizing a member or
veteran of the Armed Forces of the United States who has
received certification as an instructor in the Junior
Reserve Officers’ Training Corps program to obtain a
license to teach in the same manner as a person who has
completed the alternative route to licensure program of
this State; providing that a person licensed in such a
manner may only receive an endorsement to teach pupils
enrolled in the Junior Reserve Officers’ Training Corps
program; requiring school districts to consider
certification as an instructor in the Junior Reserve
Officers’ Training Corps program to satisfy qualifications
for certain positions of employment applied for by a
member or veteran of the Armed Forces of the United
States; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Commission on Professional Standards in Education
2 to adopt regulations relating to the qualifications to obtain a license to teach in this
3 State. (NRS 391.019) Existing law requires the regulations adopted by the
4 Commission to: (1) include the qualifications for licensing teachers and
5 administrators pursuant to an alternative route to licensure; and (2) provide for the
6 issuance of a regular license to a person who completes the education and training

16 program.
17 Existing law requires an applicant for a license as a teacher or administrator to

20 law exempts a person who received education and training pursuant to an
21 alternative route to licensure from this requirement. (NRS 391.037) Section 2 of
22 this bill also exempts a person who applies for a license as a member or veteran of
23 the Armed Forces of the United States who has received certification, including,
24 without limitation, a temporary, provisional or advanced certification, as an
25 instructor in the Junior Reserve Officers’ Training Corps program from this
26 requirement.

28 or a similar document of a veteran as credit towards such training, experience or

31 member of the Armed Forces of the United States in addition to veterans. Section 3
32 also adds certification as an instructor in the Junior Reserve Officers’ Training
33 Corps program, as described in section 1, as a specific certification on a Joint
34 Services Transcript or a similar document for which credit must be provided by a
35 school district.
