AN ACT relating to educational personnel; [authorizing] requiring the
Commission on Professional Standards in Education to adopt
regulations authorizing a member or veteran of the Armed Forces of
the United States who has received certain types of certification as an
instructor in the Junior Reserve Officers’ Training Corps program to
[obtain a license to teach in the same manner as a person who has
completed the alternative route to licensure program of this State;
providing that a person licensed in such a manner may only] receive an
endorsement to teach pupils enrolled in the Junior Reserve Officers’
Training Corps program; requiring school districts to consider
certification as an instructor in the Junior Reserve Officers’ Training
Corps program to satisfy qualifications for certain positions of
employment applied for by a member or veteran of the Armed Forces
of the United States; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Commission on Professional Standards in Education to adopt
2 regulations relating to the qualifications to obtain : (1) a license to teach in this State [.] ; and
3 (2) an endorsement to teach in a field of specialization. (NRS 391.019) [Existing law
4 requires the regulations adopted by the Commission to: (1) include the qualifications for
5 licensing teachers and administrators pursuant to an alternative route to licensure; and (2)
6 provide for the issuance of a regular license to a person who completes the education and
7 training required under the alternative route to licensure and who satisfies all other
8 requirements for licensure. (NRS 391.019) Section 1 of this bill authorizes a member or
9 veteran of the Armed Forces of the United States who has received certification as an
10 instructor in the Junior Reserve Officers’ Training Corps program, including, without
11 limitation, a temporary, provisional or advanced certification, to obtain a license in this State
12 as if the member or veteran has completed the alternative route to licensure program in this
13 State. Section 1 additionally provides that a person licensed in such a manner may only
14 receive an endorsement to teach pupils enrolled in the Junior Reserve Officers’ Training
15 Corps program.

Senate Amendment No. 717 to Senate Bill No. 175 First Reprint Page 4
16 Existing law requires an applicant for a license as a teacher or administrator to submit
17 with his or her application proof that the applicant has satisfactorily completed a course of
18 study and training approved by the Commission. Existing law exempts a person who received
19 education and training pursuant to an alternative route to licensure from this requirement.
20 (NRS 391.037)] Section [2] 2.5 of this bill [also exempts a person who applies for a license
21 as] requires the Commission to adopt regulations authorizing a member or veteran of the
22 Armed Forces of the United States who has received certification, including, without
23 limitation, a temporary, provisional or advanced certification, as an instructor in the Junior
24 Reserve Officers’ Training Corps program [from this requirement.] to receive an
25 endorsement to teach pupils enrolled in the Junior Reserve Officers’ Training Corps
26 program.
27 Existing law requires school districts to consider the Joint Services Transcript or a similar
28 document of a veteran as credit towards such training, experience or licensure required for
29 certain skilled positions of employment in that school district. (NRS 391.115) Section 3 of
30 this bill applies these provisions to a person who is a member of the Armed Forces of the
31 United States in addition to veterans. Section 3 also adds certification as an instructor in the
32 Junior Reserve Officers’ Training Corps program [, as described in section 1,] as a specific
33 certification on a Joint Services Transcript or a similar document for which credit must be
34 provided by a school district.
