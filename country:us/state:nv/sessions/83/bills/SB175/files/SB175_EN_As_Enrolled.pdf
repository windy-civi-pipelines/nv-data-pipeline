Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law requires the Commission on Professional Standards in Education
to adopt regulations relating to the qualifications to obtain: (1) a license to teach in
this State; and (2) an endorsement to teach in a field of specialization. (NRS
391.019) Section 2.5 of this bill requires the Commission to adopt regulations
authorizing a member or veteran of the Armed Forces of the United States who has
received certification, including, without limitation, a temporary, provisional or
advanced certification, as an instructor in the Junior Reserve Officers’ Training
Corps program to receive an endorsement to teach pupils enrolled in the Junior
Reserve Officers’ Training Corps program.
Existing law requires school districts to consider the Joint Services Transcript
or a similar document of a veteran as credit towards such training, experience or
licensure required for certain skilled positions of employment in that school district.
(NRS 391.115) Section 3 of this bill applies these provisions to a person who is a
member of the Armed Forces of the United States in addition to veterans. Section 3
also adds certification as an instructor in the Junior Reserve Officers’ Training
Corps program as a specific certification on a Joint Services Transcript or a similar
document for which credit must be provided by a school district.
