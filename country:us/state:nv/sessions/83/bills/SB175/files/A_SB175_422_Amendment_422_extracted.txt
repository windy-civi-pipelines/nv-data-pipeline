EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to educational personnel; authorizing a member or veteran of the
Armed Forces of the United States who has received certification as an
instructor in the Junior Reserve Officers’ Training Corps program to
obtain a license to teach in the same manner as a person who has
completed the alternative route to licensure program of this State;
providing that a person licensed in such a manner may only
receive an endorsement to teach pupils enrolled in the Junior
Reserve Officers’ Training Corps program; requiring school
districts to consider certification as an instructor in the Junior Reserve
Officers’ Training Corps program to satisfy qualifications for certain
positions of employment applied for by a member or veteran of the
Armed Forces of the United States; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Commission on Professional Standards in Education to adopt
2 regulations relating to the qualifications to obtain a license to teach in this State. (NRS
3 391.019) Existing law requires the regulations adopted by the Commission to: (1) include the
4 qualifications for licensing teachers and administrators pursuant to an alternative route to
5 licensure; and (2) provide for the issuance of a regular license to a person who completes the
6 education and training required under the alternative route to licensure and who satisfies all
7 other requirements for licensure. (NRS 391.019) Section 1 of this bill authorizes a member or
8 veteran of the Armed Forces of the United States who has received certification as an
9 instructor in the Junior Reserve Officers’ Training Corps program, including, without
10 limitation, a temporary, provisional or advanced certification, to obtain a license in this State
11 as if the member or veteran has completed the alternative route to licensure program in this
12 State. Section 1 additionally provides that a person licensed in such a manner may only
13 receive an endorsement to teach pupils enrolled in the Junior Reserve Officers’ Training
14 Corps program.
15 Existing law requires an applicant for a license as a teacher or administrator to submit
16 with his or her application proof that the applicant has satisfactorily completed a course of
17 study and training approved by the Commission. Existing law exempts a person who received
Senate Amendment No. 422 to Senate Bill No. 175 Page 4
18 education and training pursuant to an alternative route to licensure from this requirement.
19 (NRS 391.037) Section 2 of this bill also exempts a person who applies for a license as a
20 member or veteran of the Armed Forces of the United States who has received certification,
21 including, without limitation, a temporary, provisional or advanced certification, as an
22 instructor in the Junior Reserve Officers’ Training Corps program from this requirement.
23 Existing law requires school districts to consider the Joint Services Transcript or a similar
24 document of a veteran as credit towards such training, experience or licensure required for
25 certain skilled positions of employment in that school district. (NRS 391.115) Section 3 of
26 this bill applies these provisions to a person who is a member of the Armed Forces of the
27 United States in addition to veterans. Section 3 also adds certification as an instructor in the
28 Junior Reserve Officers’ Training Corps program, as described in section 1, as a specific
29 certification on a Joint Services Transcript or a similar document for which credit must be
30 provided by a school district.

providing that a person licensed in such a manner may only
