AN ACT relating to educational personnel; authorizing a member or

3 State. (NRS 391.019) Existing law requires the regulations adopted by the
4 Commission to: (1) include the qualifications for licensing teachers and
5 administrators pursuant to an alternative route to licensure; and (2) provide for the
6 issuance of a regular license to a person who completes the education and training
7 required under the alternative route to licensure and who satisfies all other
8 requirements for licensure. (NRS 391.019) Section 1 of this bill authorizes a
9 member or veteran of the Armed Forces of the United States who has received
10 certification as an instructor in the Junior Reserve Officers’ Training Corps
11 program, including, without limitation, a temporary, provisional or advanced
12 certification, to obtain a license in this State as if the member or veteran has
13 completed the alternative route to licensure program in this State.

14 Existing law requires an applicant for a license as a teacher or administrator to
15 submit with his or her application proof that the applicant has satisfactorily
16 completed a course of study and training approved by the Commission. Existing
17 law exempts a person who received education and training pursuant to an
18 alternative route to licensure from this requirement. (NRS 391.037) Section 2 of
19 this bill also exempts a person who applies for a license as a member or veteran of
20 the Armed Forces of the United States who has received certification, including,
21 without limitation, a temporary, provisional or advanced certification, as an
22 instructor in the Junior Reserve Officers’ Training Corps program from this
23 requirement.
24 Existing law requires school districts to consider the Joint Services Transcript
25 or a similar document of a veteran as credit towards such training, experience or
26 licensure required for certain skilled positions of employment in that school district.
27 (NRS 391.115) Section 3 of this bill applies these provisions to a person who is a
28 member of the Armed Forces of the United States in addition to veterans. Section 3
29 also adds certification as an instructor in the Junior Reserve Officers’ Training
30 Corps program, as described in section 1, as a specific certification on a Joint
31 Services Transcript or a similar document for which credit must be provided by a
32 school district.
