AN ACT relating to motor vehicles; revising provisions governing
the requirements for the issuance by the Department of
Motor Vehicles of a special license plate or special or

providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits a person from parking a vehicle in a parking space
2 designated for persons who are handicapped unless the person is eligible to do so
3 and the vehicle displays a special license plate or special or temporary parking
4 placard or parking sticker inscribed with the international symbol of access. (NRS
5 484B.467) Existing law authorizes the Department of Motor Vehicles to issue such
6 a special license plate or special or temporary parking placard or parking sticker to
7 an applicant upon submission of an application that includes a statement from a
8 licensed physician, physician assistant or advanced practice registered nurse
9 certifying that the applicant is a person with a disability. (NRS 482.384) Sections
10 1-4 of this bill additionally authorize an occupational therapist or physical therapist
11 to certify that the applicant is a person with a disability for purposes of an
12 application for a special license plate or special or temporary parking placard or
13 parking sticker. Section 4 authorizes the statement or certificate certifying that an
14 applicant is a person with a disability to be completed by an agent or employee of a
15 licensed physician, physician assistant, advanced practice registered nurse,
16 occupational therapist or physical therapist at the direction and under the
17 supervision of such a medical practitioner.
