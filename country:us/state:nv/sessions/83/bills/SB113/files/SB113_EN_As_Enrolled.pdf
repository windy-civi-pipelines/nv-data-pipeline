Senate Bill No. 113–Senator Steinbeck
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to motor vehicles; revising provisions governing
the requirements for the issuance by the Department of Motor
Vehicles of a special license plate or special or temporary
parking placard or parking sticker; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law prohibits a person from parking a vehicle in a parking space
designated for persons who are handicapped unless the person is eligible to do so
and the vehicle displays a special license plate or special or temporary parking
placard or parking sticker inscribed with the international symbol of access. (NRS
484B.467) Existing law authorizes the Department of Motor Vehicles to issue such
a special license plate or special or temporary parking placard or parking sticker to
an applicant upon submission of an application that includes a statement from a
licensed physician, physician assistant or advanced practice registered nurse
certifying that the applicant is a person with a disability. (NRS 482.384) Sections
1-4 of this bill additionally authorize an occupational therapist or physical therapist
to certify that the applicant is a person with a disability for purposes of an
application for a special license plate or special or temporary parking placard or
parking sticker. Section 4 authorizes the statement or certificate certifying that an
applicant is a person with a disability to be completed by an agent or employee of a
licensed physician, physician assistant, advanced practice registered nurse,
occupational therapist or physical therapist at the direction and under the
supervision of such a medical practitioner.
