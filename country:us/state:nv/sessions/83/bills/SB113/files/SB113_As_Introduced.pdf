Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits a person from parking a vehicle in a parking space
2 designated for persons who are handicapped unless the person is eligible to do so
3 and the vehicle displays a special license plate or special or temporary parking
4 placard or parking sticker inscribed with the international symbol of access. (NRS
5 484B.467) Existing law authorizes the Department of Motor Vehicles to issue such
6 a special license plate or special or temporary parking placard or parking sticker to
7 an applicant upon submission of an application that includes a statement from a
8 licensed physician, physician assistant or advanced practice registered nurse
9 certifying that the applicant is a person with a disability. (NRS 482.384) Sections
10 1-4 of this bill additionally authorize an occupational therapist or physical therapist
11 to certify that the applicant is a person with a disability for purposes of an
12 application for a special license plate or special or temporary parking placard or
13 parking sticker.
