EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to motor vehicles; revising provisions governing the requirements
for the issuance by the Department of Motor Vehicles of a special
license plate or special or temporary parking placard or parking sticker;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits a person from parking a vehicle in a parking space designated for
2 persons who are handicapped unless the person is eligible to do so and the vehicle displays a
3 special license plate or special or temporary parking placard or parking sticker inscribed with
4 the international symbol of access. (NRS 484B.467) Existing law authorizes the Department
5 of Motor Vehicles to issue such a special license plate or special or temporary parking placard
6 or parking sticker to an applicant upon submission of an application that includes a statement
7 from a licensed physician, physician assistant or advanced practice registered nurse certifying
8 that the applicant is a person with a disability. (NRS 482.384) Sections 1-4 of this bill
9 additionally authorize an occupational therapist or physical therapist to certify that the
10 applicant is a person with a disability for purposes of an application for a special license plate
11 or special or temporary parking placard or parking sticker. Section 4 authorizes the
12 statement or certificate certifying that an applicant is a person with a disability to be
13 completed by an agent or employee of a licensed physician, physician assistant, advanced
14 practice registered nurse, occupational therapist or physical therapist at the direction
15 and under the supervision of such a medical practitioner.
