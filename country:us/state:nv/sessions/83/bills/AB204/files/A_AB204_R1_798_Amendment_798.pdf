AN ACT relating to medical debt; prohibiting collection agencies and certain
entities that provide health care from reporting medical debt to a
consumer reporting agency in certain circumstances; prohibiting
certain actions by certain entities that provide health care and
collection agencies to collect a medical debt; providing requirements
for engaging in extraordinary collection actions to collect a medical
debt; [authorizing the Commissioner of Financial Institutions to
institute legal proceedings against violators;] and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides requirements governing the collection of medical debt by a
2 collection agency, including a requirement to provide certain notice to a medical debtor before
3 taking action to collect and prohibiting certain actions to collect a medical debt. (NRS
4 649.366, 649.368) Section 13 of this bill prohibits a health care entity, which includes a
5 medical facility, provider of health care or provider of emergency medical services, or a
6 collection agency from reporting a medical debt to a consumer reporting agency unless the
7 health care entity or collection agency issued an offer to the consumer to enter into a payment
8 plan to satisfy the medical debt. Section 13: (1) establishes a procedure for the issuance of
9 such an offer; (2) prohibits a health care entity or collection agency from reporting medical
10 debt to a consumer reporting agency if the consumer enters into a payment plan and complies
11 with the terms and conditions of the plan; (3) provides that any portion of the medical debt
12 that is reported to a consumer reporting agency in violation of section 13 shall be void; [and]
13 (4) requires [the Commissioner of Financial Institutions to adopt regulations to carry out the
14 provisions of section 13.] a health care entity or collection agency that enters into a
15 payment plan with a consumer to provide to the consumer a written copy of the payment
16 plan; and (5) prescribes requirements for a payment plan. Except in certain
17 circumstances, section 13.7 of this bill prohibits a health care entity or collection agency
18 from placing a payment plan into default, accelerating a payment plan or otherwise
19 cancelling a payment plan unless certain requirements are met.
20 Section 13.3 of this bill: (1) requires a health care entity or collection agency that
21 receives a payment to furnish to the consumer a receipt for the payment; and (2)
22 prescribes requirements for such receipts.
23 Sections 14 and 19 of this bill prohibit a health care entity or collection agency from
24 engaging in certain actions, or threatening to engage in certain actions, to collect a medical
25 debt, including: (1) causing the arrest of a consumer; (2) obtaining a lien or foreclosing on real

Assembly Amendment No. 798 to Assembly Bill No. 204 First Reprint Page 4
26 property of a consumer that includes the consumer’s primary residence; (3) garnishing [the
27 wages of a consumer or] any refund of federal income taxes due to a consumer; or (4)
28 garnishing, attaching or seizing the bank account of a consumer.
29 Section 15 of this bill prohibits a health care entity or collection agency from engaging in
30 extraordinary collection actions until at least 180 days after the first bill for a medical debt is
31 sent to a consumer and requires a notice that includes certain information to be sent to the
32 consumer at least 30 days before any extraordinary collection action is taken. Section 6 of this
33 bill defines the term “extraordinary collection action” to mean: (1) selling a medical debt to a
34 collection agency; (2) deferring, denying or requiring payment before providing medically
35 necessary care; or (3) any action that requires a legal or judicial process except for placing a
36 lien on third party settlements. Section 15 prohibits a health care entity or collection agency
37 from engaging in extraordinary collection actions during a state of emergency, declaration of
38 disaster or public health emergency or other health event with respect to the geographic area
39 in which a consumer resides.
40 Section 16 of this bill provides additional requirements for the collection of medical debts
41 incurred for medical services, products or devices provided by a [medical facility,] health
42 care entity, including: (1) a prohibition on engaging in extraordinary collection actions unless
43 such actions are described in the billing and collection policy of the [medical facility;] health
44 care entity; (2) a requirement to reverse any extraordinary collection actions if it is
45 determined that the consumer is eligible for financial assistance that eliminates or would have
46 eliminated the debt; and (3) requiring a consumer to be refunded within 60 days if, after the
47 application of any financial assistance, a consumer had paid an amount in excess of the
48 amount of the medical debt.
49 Section 17 of this bill provides that the protections provided by sections 13-16 cannot be
50 waived.
51 [Section 18 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner of Financial Institutions to institute
52 legal proceedings against a person who has willfully violated, is violating or is about to violate
53 the provisions of sections 2-18 of this bill. Section 18 authorizes a district court to grant
54 certain remedies in such a proceeding.]
55 Sections 3-12 define terms related to the collection of medical debts and section 2 makes
56 those terms applicable to sections 13-18.
