AN ACT relating to medical debt; prohibiting collection agencies
and certain entities that provide health care from reporting
medical debt to a consumer reporting agency in certain
circumstances; prohibiting certain actions by certain
entities that provide health care and collection agencies to
collect a medical debt; providing requirements for
engaging in extraordinary collection actions to collect a
medical debt; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides requirements governing the collection of medical debt by
2 a collection agency, including a requirement to provide certain notice to a medical
3 debtor before taking action to collect and prohibiting certain actions to collect a
4 medical debt. (NRS 649.366, 649.368) Section 13 of this bill prohibits a health care
5 entity, which includes a medical facility, provider of health care or provider of
6 emergency medical services, or a collection agency from reporting a medical debt
7 to a consumer reporting agency unless the health care entity or collection agency
8 issued an offer to the consumer to enter into a payment plan to satisfy the medical
9 debt. Section 13: (1) establishes a procedure for the issuance of such an offer; (2)
10 prohibits a health care entity or collection agency from reporting medical debt to a
11 consumer reporting agency if the consumer enters into a payment plan and
12 complies with the terms and conditions of the plan; (3) provides that any portion of
13 the medical debt that is reported to a consumer reporting agency in violation of
14 section 13 shall be void; (4) requires a health care entity or collection agency that
15 enters into a payment plan with a consumer to provide to the consumer a written
16 copy of the payment plan; and (5) prescribes requirements for a payment plan.
17 Except in certain circumstances, section 13.7 of this bill prohibits a health care
18 entity or collection agency from placing a payment plan into default, accelerating a

19 payment plan or otherwise cancelling a payment plan unless certain requirements
20 are met.
21 Section 13.3 of this bill: (1) requires a health care entity or collection agency
22 that receives a payment to furnish to the consumer a receipt for the payment; and
23 (2) prescribes requirements for such receipts.
24 Sections 14 and 19 of this bill prohibit a health care entity or collection agency
25 from engaging in certain actions, or threatening to engage in certain actions, to
26 collect a medical debt, including: (1) causing the arrest of a consumer; (2) obtaining
27 a lien or foreclosing on real property of a consumer that includes the consumer’s
28 primary residence; (3) garnishing any refund of federal income taxes due to a
29 consumer; or (4) garnishing, attaching or seizing the bank account of a consumer.
30 Section 15 of this bill prohibits a health care entity or collection agency from
31 engaging in extraordinary collection actions until at least 180 days after the first bill
32 for a medical debt is sent to a consumer and requires a notice that includes certain
33 information to be sent to the consumer at least 30 days before any extraordinary
34 collection action is taken. Section 6 of this bill defines the term “extraordinary
35 collection action” to mean: (1) selling a medical debt to a collection agency; (2)
36 deferring, denying or requiring payment before providing medically necessary care;
37 or (3) any action that requires a legal or judicial process except for placing a lien on
38 third party settlements. Section 15 prohibits a health care entity or collection
39 agency from engaging in extraordinary collection actions during a state of
40 emergency, declaration of disaster or public health emergency or other health event
41 with respect to the geographic area in which a consumer resides.
42 Section 16 of this bill provides additional requirements for the collection of
43 medical debts incurred for medical services, products or devices provided by a
44 health care entity, including: (1) a prohibition on engaging in extraordinary
45 collection actions unless such actions are described in the billing and collection
46 policy of the health care entity; (2) a requirement to reverse any extraordinary
47 collection actions if it is determined that the consumer is eligible for financial
48 assistance that eliminates or would have eliminated the debt; and (3) requiring a
49 consumer to be refunded within 60 days if, after the application of any financial
50 assistance, a consumer had paid an amount in excess of the amount of the medical
51 debt.
52 Section 17 of this bill provides that the protections provided by sections 13-16
53 cannot be waived.
54 Sections 3-12 define terms related to the collection of medical debts and
55 section 2 makes those terms applicable to sections 13-18.
