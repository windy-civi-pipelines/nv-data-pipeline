AN ACT relating to medical debt; prohibiting collection agencies

medical debt to a consumer reporting agency in certain
circumstances; prohibiting certain actions by certain
entities that provide health care and collection agencies to
collect a medical debt; providing requirements for
engaging in extraordinary collection actions to collect a
medical debt; authorizing the Commissioner of Financial

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides requirements governing the collection of medical debt by
2 a collection agency, including a requirement to provide certain notice to a medical
3 debtor before taking action to collect and prohibiting certain actions to collect a
4 medical debt. (NRS 649.366, 649.368) Section 13 of this bill prohibits a health care
5 entity, which includes a medical facility, provider of health care or provider of
6 emergency medical services, or a collection agency from reporting a medical debt
7 to a consumer reporting agency unless the health care entity or collection agency
8 issued an offer to the consumer to enter into a payment plan to satisfy the medical
9 debt. Section 13: (1) establishes a procedure for the issuance of such an offer; (2)
10 prohibits a health care entity or collection agency from reporting medical debt to a
11 consumer reporting agency if the consumer enters into a payment plan and
12 complies with the terms and conditions of the plan; (3) provides that any portion of
13 the medical debt that is reported to a consumer reporting agency in violation of
14 section 13 shall be void; and (4) requires the Commissioner of Financial
15 Institutions to adopt regulations to carry out the provisions of section 13. Sections
16 14 and 19 of this bill prohibit a health care entity or collection agency from
17 engaging in certain actions, or threatening to engage in certain actions, to collect a
18 medical debt, including: (1) causing the arrest of a consumer; (2) obtaining a lien or
-

19 foreclosing on real property of a consumer that includes the consumer’s primary
20 residence; (3) garnishing the wages of a consumer or any refund of federal income
21 taxes due to a consumer; or (4) garnishing, attaching or seizing the bank account of
22 a consumer.
23 Section 15 of this bill prohibits a health care entity or collection agency from
24 engaging in extraordinary collection actions until at least 180 days after the first bill
25 for a medical debt is sent to a consumer and requires a notice that includes certain
26 information to be sent to the consumer at least 30 days before any extraordinary
27 collection action is taken. Section 6 of this bill defines the term “extraordinary
28 collection action” to mean: (1) selling a medical debt to a collection agency; (2)
29 deferring, denying or requiring payment before providing medically necessary care;
30 or (3) any action that requires a legal or judicial process except for placing a lien on
31 third party settlements. Section 15 prohibits a health care entity or collection
32 agency from engaging in extraordinary collection actions during a state of
33 emergency, declaration of disaster or public health emergency or other health event
34 with respect to the geographic area in which a consumer resides.
35 Section 16 of this bill provides additional requirements for the collection of
36 medical debts incurred for medical services, products or devices provided by a
37 medical facility, including: (1) a prohibition on engaging in extraordinary collection
38 actions unless such actions are described in the billing and collection policy of the
39 medical facility; (2) a requirement to reverse any extraordinary collection actions if
40 it is determined that the consumer is eligible for financial assistance that eliminates
41 or would have eliminated the debt; and (3) requiring a consumer to be refunded
42 within 60 days if, after the application of any financial assistance, a consumer had
43 paid an amount in excess of the amount of the medical debt.
44 Section 17 of this bill provides that the protections provided by sections 13-16
45 cannot be waived.
46 Section 18 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner of Financial Institutions to
47 institute legal proceedings against a person who has willfully violated, is violating
48 or is about to violate the provisions of sections 2-18 of this bill. Section 18
49 authorizes a district court to grant certain remedies in such a proceeding.
50 Sections 3-12 define terms related to the collection of medical debts and
51 section 2 makes those terms applicable to sections 13-18.
