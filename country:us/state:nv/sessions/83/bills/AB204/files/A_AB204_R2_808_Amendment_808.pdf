AN ACT relating to medical debt; [prohibiting collection agencies and certain
entities that provide health care from reporting medical debt to a
consumer reporting agency in certain circumstances;] prohibiting
certain actions by certain entities that provide health care and
collection agencies to collect a medical debt; providing requirements
for engaging in extraordinary collection actions to collect a medical
debt; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides requirements governing the collection of medical debt by a
2 collection agency, including a requirement to provide certain notice to a medical debtor before
3 taking action to collect and prohibiting certain actions to collect a medical debt. (NRS
4 649.366, 649.368) [Section 13 of this bill prohibits a health care entity, which includes a
5 medical facility, provider of health care or provider of emergency medical services, or a
6 collection agency from reporting a medical debt to a consumer reporting agency unless the
7 health care entity or collection agency issued an offer to the consumer to enter into a payment
8 plan to satisfy the medical debt. Section 13: (1) establishes a procedure for the issuance of
9 such an offer; (2) prohibits a health care entity or collection agency from reporting medical
10 debt to a consumer reporting agency if the consumer enters into a payment plan and complies
11 with the terms and conditions of the plan; (3) provides that any portion of the medical debt
12 that is reported to a consumer reporting agency in violation of section 13 shall be void; (4)
13 requires a health care entity or collection agency that enters into a payment plan with a
14 consumer to provide to the consumer a written copy of the payment plan; and (5) prescribes
15 requirements for a payment plan. Except in certain circumstances, section 13.7 of this bill
16 prohibits a health care entity or collection agency from placing a payment plan into default,
17 accelerating a payment plan or otherwise cancelling a payment plan unless certain
18 requirements are met.
19 Section 13.3 of this bill: (1) requires a health care entity or collection agency that receives
20 a payment to furnish to the consumer a receipt for the payment; and (2) prescribes
21 requirements for such receipts.]
22 Sections 14 and 19 of this bill prohibit a health care entity or collection agency from
23 engaging in certain actions, or threatening to engage in certain actions, to collect a medical
24 debt, including: (1) causing the arrest of a consumer; (2) obtaining a lien or foreclosing on real
25 property of a consumer that includes the consumer’s primary residence; (3) garnishing any
26 refund of federal income taxes due to a consumer; or (4) garnishing, attaching or seizing the
27 bank account of a consumer.

Assembly Amendment No. 808 to Assembly Bill No. 204 Second Reprint Page 4
28 Section 15 of this bill prohibits a health care entity or collection agency from engaging in
29 extraordinary collection actions until at least 180 days after the first bill for a medical debt is
30 sent to a consumer and requires a notice that includes certain information to be sent to the
31 consumer at least 30 days before any extraordinary collection action is taken. Section 6 of this
32 bill defines the term “extraordinary collection action” to mean: (1) selling a medical debt to a
33 collection agency; (2) [deferring, denying or requiring payment before providing medically
34 necessary care; or (3)] any action that requires a legal or judicial process except for placing a
35 lien on third party settlements [.] ; (3) reporting, furnishing or threatening to report or
36 furnish any information regarding a medical debt to a consumer reporting agency; or
37 (4) garnishing or threatening to garnish the wages of a consumer. Section 15 prohibits a
38 health care entity or collection agency from engaging in extraordinary collection actions
39 [during] when there is a state of emergency, declaration of disaster or public health
40 emergency or other health event [with respect to the geographic area] in the county in which
41 a consumer resides [.] and tolls any statute of limitations applicable to a claim to recover
42 on a medical debt during the same period.
43 Section 16 of this bill provides additional requirements for the collection of medical debts
44 incurred for medical services, medical products or medical devices provided by a health care
45 entity, including: (1) a prohibition on engaging in extraordinary collection actions unless such
46 actions are described in the billing and collection policy of the health care entity; (2) a
47 requirement to reverse any extraordinary collection actions if it is determined that the
48 consumer is eligible for financial assistance that eliminates or would have eliminated the debt;
49 and (3) requiring a consumer to be refunded within 60 days if, after the application of any
50 financial assistance, a consumer had paid an amount in excess of the amount of the medical
51 debt.
52 Section 17 of this bill provides that the protections provided by sections 13-16 cannot be
53 waived.
54 Sections [3-12] 2.5-12 of this bill define terms related to the collection of medical debts
55 and section 2 of this bill makes those terms applicable to sections [13-18.] 2-18.
