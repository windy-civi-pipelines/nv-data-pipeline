Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides requirements governing the collection of medical debt by
2 a collection agency, including a requirement to provide certain notice to a medical
3 debtor before taking action to collect and prohibiting certain actions to collect a
4 medical debt. (NRS 649.366, 649.368) Section 13 of this bill prohibits a health care
5 entity, which includes a medical facility, provider of health care or provider of
6 emergency medical services, or a collection agency from reporting a medical debt
7 to a consumer reporting agency and renders any portion of a medical debt that is so
8 reported void. Section 13 requires a health care entity to include in any contract
9 entered into with a collection agency for the purchase or collection of a medical
10 debt provisions prohibiting the reporting of medical debt to a consumer reporting
11 agency, voiding any portion of a medical debt that is reported to a consumer
12 reporting agency and prohibiting certain collection actions that are prohibited by
13 section 14 of this bill. Sections 14 and 19 of this bill prohibit a health care entity or
14 collection agency from engaging in certain actions, or threatening to engage in

15 certain actions, to collect a medical debt, including: (1) causing the arrest of a
16 consumer; (2) obtaining a lien or foreclosing on real property of a consumer that
17 includes the consumer’s primary residence; (3) garnishing the wages of a consumer

19 attaching or seizing the bank account of a consumer.
20 Section 15 of this bill prohibits a health care entity or collection agency from
21 engaging in extraordinary collection actions until at least 180 days after the first bill
22 for a medical debt is sent to a consumer and requires a notice that includes certain
23 information to be sent to the consumer at least 30 days before any extraordinary
24 collection action is taken. Section 6 of this bill defines the term “extraordinary
25 collection action” to mean: (1) selling a medical debt to a collection agency; (2)
26 deferring, denying or requiring payment before providing medically necessary care;
27 or (3) any action that requires a legal or judicial process. Section 15 prohibits a
28 health care entity or collection agency from engaging in extraordinary collection
29 actions during a state of emergency, declaration of disaster or public health
30 emergency or other health event with respect to the geographic area in which a
31 consumer resides.
32 Section 16 of this bill provides additional requirements for the collection of
33 medical debts incurred for health care services, products or devices provided by a
34 medical facility, including: (1) a prohibition on engaging in extraordinary collection
35 actions unless such actions are described in the billing and collection policy of the
36 medical facility; (2) a requirement to reverse any extraordinary collection actions if
37 it is determined that the consumer is eligible for financial assistance that eliminates
38 or would have eliminated the debt; and (3) requiring a consumer to be refunded
39 within 60 days if, after the application of any financial assistance, a consumer had
40 paid an amount in excess of the amount of the medical debt.
41 Section 17 of this bill provides that the protections provided by sections 13-16
42 cannot be waived.
43 Section 18 of this bill authorizes the Attorney General to institute legal
44 proceedings against a person who has violated, is violating or is about to violate the
45 provisions of sections 2-18 of this bill. Section 18 authorizes a district court to
46 grant certain remedies in such a proceeding.
47 Sections 3-12 define terms related to the collection of medical debts and
48 section 2 makes those terms applicable to sections 13-18.
