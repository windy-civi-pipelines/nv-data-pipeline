AN ACT relating to medical debt; prohibiting certain actions by certain entities that
provide health care and collection agencies to collect a medical debt;
providing requirements for engaging in extraordinary collection actions
to collect a medical debt; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides requirements governing the collection of medical debt by a
2 collection agency, including a requirement to provide certain notice to a medical debtor before
3 taking action to collect and prohibiting certain actions to collect a medical debt. (NRS
4 649.366, 649.368)
5 Sections 14 and 19 of this bill prohibit a health care entity or collection agency from
6 engaging in certain actions, or threatening to engage in certain actions, to collect a medical
7 debt, including: (1) causing the arrest of a consumer; (2) obtaining a lien or foreclosing on real
8 property of a consumer that includes the consumer’s primary residence; (3) garnishing any
9 refund of federal income taxes due to a consumer; or (4) garnishing, attaching or seizing the
10 bank account of a consumer.
11 Section 15 of this bill prohibits a health care entity or collection agency from engaging in
12 extraordinary collection actions until at least 180 days after the first bill for a medical debt is
13 sent to a consumer and requires a notice that includes certain information to be sent to the
14 consumer at least 30 days before any extraordinary collection action is taken. Section 6 of this
15 bill defines the term “extraordinary collection action” to mean: (1) selling a medical debt to a
16 collection agency; (2) any action that requires a legal or judicial process except for placing a
17 lien on third party settlements; (3) reporting, furnishing or threatening to report or furnish any
18 information regarding a medical debt to a consumer reporting agency; or (4) garnishing or
19 threatening to garnish the wages of a consumer. Section 15 prohibits a health care entity or
20 collection agency from engaging in extraordinary collection actions when there is a state of
21 emergency, declaration of disaster or public health emergency or other health event in the
22 county in this State in which a consumer resides and tolls any statute of limitations applicable
23 to a claim to recover on a medical debt during the same period. If the state of emergency,
24 declaration of disaster or public health emergency has been declared pursuant to federal
25 law, section 15 limits the duration of the prohibition on extraordinary collection actions
26 to 6 months after the effective date of the declaration of emergency or disaster.
27 Section 16 of this bill provides additional requirements for the collection of medical debts
28 incurred for medical services, medical products or medical devices provided by a health care
29 entity, including: (1) a prohibition on engaging in extraordinary collection actions unless such
30 actions are described in the billing and collection policy of the health care entity; (2) a

Senate Amendment No. 951 to Assembly Bill No. 204 Third Reprint Page 4
31 requirement to reverse any extraordinary collection actions if it is determined that the
32 consumer is eligible for financial assistance that eliminates or would have eliminated the debt;
33 and (3) requiring a consumer to be refunded within 60 days if, after the application of any
34 financial assistance, a consumer had paid an amount in excess of the amount of the medical
35 debt.
36 Section 17 of this bill provides that the protections provided by sections 13-16 cannot be
37 waived.
38 Sections 2.5-12 of this bill define terms related to the collection of medical debts and
39 section 2 of this bill makes those terms applicable to sections 2-18.
