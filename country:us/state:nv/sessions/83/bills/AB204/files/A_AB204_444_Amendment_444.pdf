AN ACT relating to medical debt; prohibiting collection agencies and certain
entities that provide health care from reporting medical debt to a
consumer reporting agency [; requiring a contract for the purchase or
collection of medical debt between certain entities that provide health
care and a collection agency to include certain provisions;] in certain
circumstances; prohibiting certain actions by certain entities that
provide health care and collection agencies to collect a medical debt;
providing requirements for engaging in extraordinary collection actions
to collect a medical debt; authorizing the [Attorney General]
Commissioner of Financial Institutions to institute legal proceedings
against violators; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides requirements governing the collection of medical debt by a
2 collection agency, including a requirement to provide certain notice to a medical debtor before
3 taking action to collect and prohibiting certain actions to collect a medical debt. (NRS
4 649.366, 649.368) Section 13 of this bill prohibits a health care entity, which includes a
5 medical facility, provider of health care or provider of emergency medical services, or a
6 collection agency from reporting a medical debt to a consumer reporting agency [and renders
7 any portion of a medical debt that is so reported void. Section 13 requires a health care entity
8 to include in any contract entered into with a collection agency for the purchase or collection
9 of a medical debt provisions prohibiting the reporting of medical debt to a consumer reporting
10 agency, voiding any portion of a medical debt that is reported to a consumer reporting agency
11 and prohibiting certain collection actions that are prohibited by section 14 of this bill.] unless
12 the health care entity or collection agency issued an offer to the consumer to enter into a
13 payment plan to satisfy the medical debt. Section 13: (1) establishes a procedure for the
14 issuance of such an offer; (2) prohibits a health care entity or collection agency from
15 reporting medical debt to a consumer reporting agency if the consumer enters into a
16 payment plan and complies with the terms and conditions of the plan; (3) provides that
17 any portion of the medical debt that is reported to a consumer reporting agency in
18 violation of section 13 shall be void; and (4) requires the Commissioner of Financial
19 Institutions to adopt regulations to carry out the provisions of section 13. Sections 14 and
20 19 of this bill prohibit a health care entity or collection agency from engaging in certain
21 actions, or threatening to engage in certain actions, to collect a medical debt, including: (1)
22 causing the arrest of a consumer; (2) obtaining a lien or foreclosing on real property of a

Assembly Amendment No. 444 to Assembly Bill No. 204 Page 4
23 consumer that includes the consumer’s primary residence; (3) garnishing the wages of a
24 consumer or any refund of federal income taxes due to a consumer; or (4) garnishing,
25 attaching or seizing the bank account of a consumer.
26 Section 15 of this bill prohibits a health care entity or collection agency from engaging in
27 extraordinary collection actions until at least 180 days after the first bill for a medical debt is
28 sent to a consumer and requires a notice that includes certain information to be sent to the
29 consumer at least 30 days before any extraordinary collection action is taken. Section 6 of this
30 bill defines the term “extraordinary collection action” to mean: (1) selling a medical debt to a
31 collection agency; (2) deferring, denying or requiring payment before providing medically
32 necessary care; or (3) any action that requires a legal or judicial process [.] except for placing
33 a lien on third party settlements. Section 15 prohibits a health care entity or collection
34 agency from engaging in extraordinary collection actions during a state of emergency,
35 declaration of disaster or public health emergency or other health event with respect to the
36 geographic area in which a consumer resides.
37 Section 16 of this bill provides additional requirements for the collection of medical debts
38 incurred for [health care] medical services, products or devices provided by a medical facility,
39 including: (1) a prohibition on engaging in extraordinary collection actions unless such actions
40 are described in the billing and collection policy of the medical facility; (2) a requirement to
41 reverse any extraordinary collection actions if it is determined that the consumer is eligible for
42 financial assistance that eliminates or would have eliminated the debt; and (3) requiring a
43 consumer to be refunded within 60 days if, after the application of any financial assistance, a
44 consumer had paid an amount in excess of the amount of the medical debt.
45 Section 17 of this bill provides that the protections provided by sections 13-16 cannot be
46 waived.
47 Section 18 of this bill authorizes the [Attorney General] Commissioner of Financial
48 Institutions to institute legal proceedings against a person who has willfully violated, is
49 violating or is about to violate the provisions of sections 2-18 of this bill. Section 18
50 authorizes a district court to grant certain remedies in such a proceeding.
51 Sections 3-12 define terms related to the collection of medical debts and section 2 makes
52 those terms applicable to sections 13-18.
