3 debtor before taking action to collect and prohibiting certain actions to collect a
4 medical debt. (NRS 649.366, 649.368)
5 Sections 14 and 19 of this bill prohibit a health care entity or collection agency
6 from engaging in certain actions, or threatening to engage in certain actions, to
7 collect a medical debt, including: (1) causing the arrest of a consumer; (2) obtaining
8 a lien or foreclosing on real property of a consumer that includes the consumer’s

11 Section 15 of this bill prohibits a health care entity or collection agency from

13 for a medical debt is sent to a consumer and requires a notice that includes certain
14 information to be sent to the consumer at least 30 days before any extraordinary
15 collection action is taken. Section 6 of this bill defines the term “extraordinary

17 action that requires a legal or judicial process except for placing a lien on third
18 party settlements; (3) reporting, furnishing or threatening to report or furnish any
19 information regarding a medical debt to a consumer reporting agency; or (4)
20 garnishing or threatening to garnish the wages of a consumer. Section 15 prohibits
21 a health care entity or collection agency from engaging in extraordinary collection
22 actions when there is a state of emergency, declaration of disaster or public health
23 emergency or other health event in the county in this State in which a consumer

26 disaster or public health emergency has been declared pursuant to federal law,
27 section 15 limits the duration of the prohibition on extraordinary collection actions
28 to 6 months after the effective date of the declaration of emergency or disaster.
29 Section 16 of this bill provides additional requirements for the collection of
30 medical debts incurred for medical services, medical products or medical devices
31 provided by a health care entity, including: (1) a prohibition on engaging in
32 extraordinary collection actions unless such actions are described in the billing and
33 collection policy of the health care entity; (2) a requirement to reverse any
34 extraordinary collection actions if it is determined that the consumer is eligible for
35 financial assistance that eliminates or would have eliminated the debt; and (3)
36 requiring a consumer to be refunded within 60 days if, after the application of any
37 financial assistance, a consumer had paid an amount in excess of the amount of the
38 medical debt.
39 Section 17 of this bill provides that the protections provided by sections 13-16
40 cannot be waived.
41 Sections 2.5-12 of this bill define terms related to the collection of medical
42 debts and section 2 of this bill makes those terms applicable to sections 2-18.
