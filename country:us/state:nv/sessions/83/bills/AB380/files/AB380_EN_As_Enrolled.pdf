CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to behavioral health; revising requirements
governing mobile crisis teams that may be established to
provide community-based intervention services to certain
persons experiencing a behavioral health crisis; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing federal law establishes the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline
program, including the establishment of a national suicide prevention and mental
health crisis hotline that may be accessed by dialing the digits 9-8-8. (42 U.S.C. §
290bb-36c) Existing law requires the Division of Public and Behavioral Health of
the Department of Health and Human Services to encourage the establishment of
and, to the extent that money is available, establish mobile crisis teams to provide
community-based intervention for persons who are considering suicide or otherwise
in a behavioral health crisis and who access the 9-8-8 hotline. Existing law requires
such a mobile crisis team to: (1) be based in the jurisdiction that the team serves
and consist of persons professionally qualified in the field of behavioral health and
providers of peer recovery support services; (2) be established by a provider of
emergency medical services and consist of persons professionally qualified in the
field of behavioral health and providers of peer recovery support services; or (3) be
established by a law enforcement agency and include law enforcement agents,
persons professionally qualified in the field of psychiatric mental health and
providers of peer recovery support services. (NRS 433.704)
This bill removes requirements concerning the location of a mobile crisis team
and who may establish a mobile crisis team. This bill also revises the composition
of a mobile crisis team to require that any mobile crisis team established by or with
the support of the Division consist of: (1) one or more persons who are
professionally qualified in the field of behavioral health; and (2) one or more law
enforcement officers, providers of emergency medical services or persons with
appropriate expertise in the field of behavioral health, such as a community health
worker, a provider of case management services, a provider of peer recovery
support services or a similar paraprofessional.
