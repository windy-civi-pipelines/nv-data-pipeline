Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Department of Health and Human Services, or
2 divisions thereof, to conduct various programs for the improvement of public health
3 and health care in this State. (NRS 433.702-433.744, 439.4921-439.525, 439.529-
4 439.5297, 439.600-439.690, 439A.111-439A.185, 439A.200-439A.290, 442.710-
5 442.745, 457.230-457.280, 458.025, 458A.090, 458A.100, 458A.110) This bill
6 establishes the Statewide Health Care Access and Recruitment Grant Program,
-
*SB434_R2*
– 2 –
7 which is a competitive grant program managed by the Department of Health and
8 Human Services to support projects to address critical shortages of providers of
9 health care or clinical services or expertise in this State. Sections 3-7 of this bill
10 define certain terms, and section 2 of this bill establishes the applicability of those
11 definitions. Section 8 of this bill establishes the Statewide Health Care Access and
12 Recruitment Program Account to hold money to fund the Program. Section 8
13 authorizes the Director of the Department, with the approval of the Interim Finance
14 Committee, to transfer money from the Account to another account for the purpose
15 of obtaining additional federal financial participation under Medicaid. Section 19
16 of this bill authorizes the Interim Finance Committee to issue such approval during
17 a legislative session.
18 Existing law: (1) creates the Account to Stabilize the Operation of State
19 Government, also known as the Rainy Day Fund, in the State General Fund; and (2)
20 prescribes a procedure for the transfer of money from that Account to the State
21 General Fund during certain periods of low revenue or fiscal emergency. Existing
22 law requires certain transfers of money to be made from the State General Fund to
23 the Rainy Day Fund, including, without limitation, an annual transfer of 1 percent
24 of the anticipated revenue for the State during the current fiscal year into the Rainy
25 Day Fund. (NRS 353.288) Beginning on July 1, 2027, section 8 requires the State
26 Controller to annually transfer 0.5 percent of the anticipated revenue for the State
27 during the current fiscal year into the Statewide Health Care Access and
28 Recruitment Program Account. However, section 8 prohibits such a transfer if the
29 balance of the Account increases to an amount greater than $60,000,000 and
30 prohibits subsequent transfers until the balance in that Account drops below
31 $30,000,000. Section 20 of this bill reduces the amount that the State Controller is
32 required to transfer to the Rainy Day Fund in fiscal years when the State Controller
33 transfers money to the Statewide Health Care Access and Recruitment Program
34 Account to 0.5 percent of the anticipated revenue for the State during the next fiscal
35 year. Section 8 prohibits a transfer into the Statewide Health Care Access and
36 Recruitment Program Account if the balance of the Rainy Day Fund is less than $1
37 billion, and section 20 requires the money that would otherwise be transferred into
38 the Account under those circumstances to instead be transferred into the Rainy Day
39 Fund.
40 To the extent that money is available from rebates received by this State for
41 prescription drugs, section 8 authorizes the Director, not later than June 30 of each
42 fiscal year, to request the approval of the Interim Finance Committee for a transfer
43 of not more than $25,000,000 of that money to the Statewide Health Care Access
44 and Recruitment Program Account for that fiscal year.
45 Section 9 of this bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services to
46 conduct a biennial assessment of the health care needs of this State, which must
47 identify health care professions and specialties and types of clinical services and
48 expertise and geographic areas experiencing critical shortages of providers of
49 health care or clinical services or expertise. Section 21.5 of this bill requires the
50 Department to utilize existing assessments in lieu of conducting the first scheduled
51 assessment on or before July 1, 2026. Section 10 authorizes certain entities
52 involved in the provision of health care, governmental entities and certain nonprofit
53 organizations to apply for a grant of money from the Account to support a project
54 to address those critical shortages. Section 10 imposes certain additional
55 requirements for a project to be eligible to receive such funding, including a
56 requirement that the applicant has secured matching financial or in-kind
57 contributions valued at an amount at least equal to the amount of the grant being
58 sought. Section 11 of this bill prescribes the required contents of an application for
59 such a grant. Sections 12 and 13 of the bill prescribe the process for the
60 Department to review applications and, with the approval of the Interim Finance
-
*SB434_R2*
– 3 –
61 Committee, award grants. Section 19 authorizes the Interim Finance Committee to
62 issue such approval during a legislative session.
63 After a grant is awarded, section 14 of this bill requires the Department to enter
64 into a funding agreement with the grantee that outlines the terms and conditions of
65 the grant and the responsibilities of the grantee. Section 15 of this bill requires a
66 grantee to notify and submit a revised plan to the Department if: (1) the grantee
67 significantly modifies a funded project; (2) the amount of money available for a
68 funded project changes; (3) a funded project becomes inactive for at least 12
69 months; or (4) a funded project is terminated. Section 15 authorizes the Department
70 to take certain actions in response to such notice. Section 16 of this bill authorizes
71 the Department and the Office of Finance to provide certain oversight of a funded
72 project. Section 17 of this bill authorizes the Department to suspend or terminate a
73 grant or take certain other actions if it determines that the grantee has failed to
74 comply with a funding agreement. Section 17 also requires the Department to
75 suspend or terminate a grant if it determines that the grantee has violated applicable
76 law, misused funds or submitted fraudulent information to the Department. Upon
77 the completion of a funded project and again 10 years after the completion of a
78 funded project, section 18 of this bill requires the grantee to submit a report to the
79 Department concerning the project.

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Department of Health and Human Services, or
2 divisions thereof, to conduct various programs for the improvement of public health
3 and health care in this State. (NRS 433.702-433.744, 439.4921-439.525, 439.529-
4 439.5297, 439.600-439.690, 439A.111-439A.185, 439A.200-439A.290, 442.710-
5 442.745, 457.230-457.280, 458.025, 458A.090, 458A.100, 458A.110) This bill
6 establishes the Statewide Health Care Access and Recruitment Grant Program,
-
*SB434_R2*

– 2 –
7 which is a competitive grant program managed by the Department of Health and
8 Human Services to support projects to address critical shortages of providers of
9 health care or clinical services or expertise in this State. Sections 3-7 of this bill
10 define certain terms, and section 2 of this bill establishes the applicability of those
11 definitions. Section 8 of this bill establishes the Statewide Health Care Access and
12 Recruitment Program Account to hold money to fund the Program. Section 8
13 authorizes the Director of the Department, with the approval of the Interim Finance
14 Committee, to transfer money from the Account to another account for the purpose
15 of obtaining additional federal financial participation under Medicaid. Section 19
16 of this bill authorizes the Interim Finance Committee to issue such approval during
17 a legislative session.
18 Existing law: (1) creates the Account to Stabilize the Operation of State
19 Government, also known as the Rainy Day Fund, in the State General Fund; and (2)
20 prescribes a procedure for the transfer of money from that Account to the State
21 General Fund during certain periods of low revenue or fiscal emergency. Existing
22 law requires certain transfers of money to be made from the State General Fund to
23 the Rainy Day Fund, including, without limitation, an annual transfer of 1 percent
24 of the anticipated revenue for the State during the current fiscal year into the Rainy
25 Day Fund. (NRS 353.288) Beginning on July 1, 2027, section 8 requires the State
26 Controller to annually transfer 0.5 percent of the anticipated revenue for the State
27 during the current fiscal year into the Statewide Health Care Access and
28 Recruitment Program Account. However, section 8 prohibits such a transfer if the
29 balance of the Account increases to an amount greater than $60,000,000 and
30 prohibits subsequent transfers until the balance in that Account drops below
31 $30,000,000. Section 20 of this bill reduces the amount that the State Controller is
32 required to transfer to the Rainy Day Fund in fiscal years when the State Controller
33 transfers money to the Statewide Health Care Access and Recruitment Program
34 Account to 0.5 percent of the anticipated revenue for the State during the next fiscal
35 year. Section 8 prohibits a transfer into the Statewide Health Care Access and
36 Recruitment Program Account if the balance of the Rainy Day Fund is less than $1
37 billion, and section 20 requires the money that would otherwise be transferred into
38 the Account under those circumstances to instead be transferred into the Rainy Day
39 Fund.
40 To the extent that money is available from rebates received by this State for
41 prescription drugs, section 8 authorizes the Director, not later than June 30 of each
42 fiscal year, to request the approval of the Interim Finance Committee for a transfer
43 of not more than $25,000,000 of that money to the Statewide Health Care Access
44 and Recruitment Program Account for that fiscal year.
45 Section 9 of this bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services to
46 conduct a biennial assessment of the health care needs of this State, which must
47 identify health care professions and specialties and types of clinical services and
48 expertise and geographic areas experiencing critical shortages of providers of
49 health care or clinical services or expertise. Section 21.5 of this bill requires the
50 Department to utilize existing assessments in lieu of conducting the first scheduled
51 assessment on or before July 1, 2026. Section 10 authorizes certain entities
52 involved in the provision of health care, governmental entities and certain nonprofit
53 organizations to apply for a grant of money from the Account to support a project
54 to address those critical shortages. Section 10 imposes certain additional
55 requirements for a project to be eligible to receive such funding, including a
56 requirement that the applicant has secured matching financial or in-kind
57 contributions valued at an amount at least equal to the amount of the grant being
58 sought. Section 11 of this bill prescribes the required contents of an application for
59 such a grant. Sections 12 and 13 of the bill prescribe the process for the
60 Department to review applications and, with the approval of the Interim Finance
-
*SB434_R2*

– 3 –
61 Committee, award grants. Section 19 authorizes the Interim Finance Committee to
62 issue such approval during a legislative session.
63 After a grant is awarded, section 14 of this bill requires the Department to enter
64 into a funding agreement with the grantee that outlines the terms and conditions of
65 the grant and the responsibilities of the grantee. Section 15 of this bill requires a
66 grantee to notify and submit a revised plan to the Department if: (1) the grantee
67 significantly modifies a funded project; (2) the amount of money available for a
68 funded project changes; (3) a funded project becomes inactive for at least 12
69 months; or (4) a funded project is terminated. Section 15 authorizes the Department
70 to take certain actions in response to such notice. Section 16 of this bill authorizes
71 the Department and the Office of Finance to provide certain oversight of a funded
72 project. Section 17 of this bill authorizes the Department to suspend or terminate a
73 grant or take certain other actions if it determines that the grantee has failed to
74 comply with a funding agreement. Section 17 also requires the Department to
75 suspend or terminate a grant if it determines that the grantee has violated applicable
76 law, misused funds or submitted fraudulent information to the Department. Upon
77 the completion of a funded project and again 10 years after the completion of a
78 funded project, section 18 of this bill requires the grantee to submit a report to the
79 Department concerning the project.
