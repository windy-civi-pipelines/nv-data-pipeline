Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Department of Health and Human Services, or
2 divisions thereof, to conduct various programs for the improvement of public health
3 and health care in this State. (NRS 433.702-433.744, 439.4921-439.525, 439.529-
4 439.5297, 439.600-439.690, 439A.111-439A.185, 439A.200-439A.290, 442.710-
5 442.745, 457.230-457.280, 458.025, 458A.090, 458A.100, 458A.110) This bill
6 establishes the Statewide Health Care Access and Recruitment Grant Program,
-
*SB434*
– 2 –
7 which is a competitive grant program managed by the Department of Health and
8 Human Services to support projects to address critical shortages of providers of
9 health care in this State. Sections 3-7 of this bill define certain terms, and section 2
10 of this bill establishes the applicability of those definitions. Section 8 of this bill
11 establishes the Statewide Health Care Access and Recruitment Program Account to
12 hold money to fund the Program. Section 21 of this bill appropriates money into
13 the Account for the purposes of the Program. Section 8 authorizes the Director of
14 the Department, with the approval of the Interim Finance Committee, to transfer
15 money from the Account to another account for the purpose of obtaining additional
16 federal financial participation under Medicaid. Section 19 of this bill authorizes the
17 Interim Finance Committee to issue such approval during a legislative session.
18 Existing law: (1) creates the Account to Stabilize the Operation of State
19 Government, also known as the Rainy Day Fund, in the State General Fund; and (2)
20 prescribes a procedure for the transfer of money from that Account to the State
21 General Fund during certain periods of low revenue or fiscal emergency. Existing
22 law requires certain transfers of money to be made from the State General Fund to
23 the Rainy Day Fund, including, without limitation, an annual transfer of 1 percent
24 of the anticipated revenue for the State during the current fiscal year into the Rainy
25 Day Fund. (NRS 353.288) Beginning on July 1, 2027, section 8 requires the State
26 Controller to annually transfer 0.5 percent of the anticipated revenue for the State
27 during the current fiscal year into the Statewide Health Care Access and
28 Recruitment Program Account. However, section 8 prohibits such a transfer if the
29 balance of the Account increases to an amount greater than $60,000,000 and
30 prohibits subsequent transfers until the balance in that Account drops below
31 $30,000,000. Section 20 of this bill reduces the amount that the State Controller is
32 required to transfer to the Rainy Day Fund in fiscal years when the State Controller
33 transfers money to the Statewide Health Care Access and Recruitment Program
34 Account to 0.5 percent of the anticipated revenue for the State during the next fiscal
35 year.
36 Section 9 of this bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services to
37 conduct a biennial assessment of the health care needs of this State, which must
38 identify health care professions and specialties and geographic areas experiencing
39 critical shortages of providers of health care. Section 10 authorizes certain entities
40 involved in the provision of health care, governmental entities and certain nonprofit
41 organizations to apply for a grant of money from the Account to support a project
42 to address those critical shortages. Section 10 imposes certain additional
43 requirements for a project to be eligible to receive such funding, including a
44 requirement that the applicant has secured matching financial or in-kind
45 contributions valued at an amount at least equal to the amount of the grant being
46 sought. Section 11 of this bill prescribes the required contents of an application for
47 such a grant. Sections 12 and 13 of the bill prescribe the process for the
48 Department to review applications and, with the approval of the Interim Finance
49 Committee, award grants. Section 19 authorizes the Interim Finance Committee to
50 issue such approval during a legislative session.
51 After a grant is awarded, section 14 of this bill requires the Department to
52 enter into a funding agreement with the grantee that outlines the terms and
53 conditions of the grant and the responsibilities of the grantee. Section 15 of this bill
54 requires a grantee to notify and submit a revised plan to the Department if: (1) the
55 grantee significantly modifies a funded project; (2) the amount of money available
56 for a funded project changes; (3) a funded project becomes inactive for at least 12
57 months; or (4) a funded project is terminated. Section 15 authorizes the Department
58 to take certain actions in response to such notice. Section 16 of this bill authorizes
59 the Department and the Office of Finance to provide certain oversight of a funded
60 project. Section 17 of this bill authorizes the Department to suspend or terminate a
61 grant or take certain other actions if it determines that the grantee has failed to
-
*SB434*
– 3 –
62 comply with a funding agreement. Section 17 also requires the Department to
63 suspend or terminate a grant if it determines that the grantee has violated applicable
64 law, misused funds or submitted fraudulent information to the Department. Upon
65 the completion of a funded project and again 10 years after the completion of a
66 funded project, section 18 of this bill requires the grantee to submit a report to the
67 Department concerning the project.

~

AN ACT relating to health care; creating the Statewide Health Care
Access and Recruitment Program Account; providing for
certain transfers of money into and out of the Account;
requiring a biennial assessment of the health care needs of
this State; establishing the Statewide Health Care Access
and Recruitment Grant Program to award grants of money
to fund certain projects to address shortages of providers
of health care identified by the assessment; requiring a
grantee to enter into a funding agreement with the
Department of Health and Human Services; providing for
certain oversight of projects funded through the Program;
authorizing the Department to take certain actions in
response to certain changes to a funded project or if a
grantee fails to comply with a funding agreement or
applicable law; reducing the amount of certain transfers
into the Account to Stabilize the Operation of State
Government; making an appropriation; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Department of Health and Human Services, or
2 divisions thereof, to conduct various programs for the improvement of public health
3 and health care in this State. (NRS 433.702-433.744, 439.4921-439.525, 439.529-
4 439.5297, 439.600-439.690, 439A.111-439A.185, 439A.200-439A.290, 442.710-
5 442.745, 457.230-457.280, 458.025, 458A.090, 458A.100, 458A.110) This bill
6 establishes the Statewide Health Care Access and Recruitment Grant Program,
-
*SB434*

– 2 –
7 which is a competitive grant program managed by the Department of Health and
8 Human Services to support projects to address critical shortages of providers of
9 health care in this State. Sections 3-7 of this bill define certain terms, and section 2
10 of this bill establishes the applicability of those definitions. Section 8 of this bill
11 establishes the Statewide Health Care Access and Recruitment Program Account to
12 hold money to fund the Program. Section 21 of this bill appropriates money into
13 the Account for the purposes of the Program. Section 8 authorizes the Director of
14 the Department, with the approval of the Interim Finance Committee, to transfer
15 money from the Account to another account for the purpose of obtaining additional
16 federal financial participation under Medicaid. Section 19 of this bill authorizes the
17 Interim Finance Committee to issue such approval during a legislative session.
18 Existing law: (1) creates the Account to Stabilize the Operation of State
19 Government, also known as the Rainy Day Fund, in the State General Fund; and (2)
20 prescribes a procedure for the transfer of money from that Account to the State
21 General Fund during certain periods of low revenue or fiscal emergency. Existing
22 law requires certain transfers of money to be made from the State General Fund to
23 the Rainy Day Fund, including, without limitation, an annual transfer of 1 percent
24 of the anticipated revenue for the State during the current fiscal year into the Rainy
25 Day Fund. (NRS 353.288) Beginning on July 1, 2027, section 8 requires the State
26 Controller to annually transfer 0.5 percent of the anticipated revenue for the State
27 during the current fiscal year into the Statewide Health Care Access and
28 Recruitment Program Account. However, section 8 prohibits such a transfer if the
29 balance of the Account increases to an amount greater than $60,000,000 and
30 prohibits subsequent transfers until the balance in that Account drops below
31 $30,000,000. Section 20 of this bill reduces the amount that the State Controller is
32 required to transfer to the Rainy Day Fund in fiscal years when the State Controller
33 transfers money to the Statewide Health Care Access and Recruitment Program
34 Account to 0.5 percent of the anticipated revenue for the State during the next fiscal
35 year.
36 Section 9 of this bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services to
37 conduct a biennial assessment of the health care needs of this State, which must
38 identify health care professions and specialties and geographic areas experiencing
39 critical shortages of providers of health care. Section 10 authorizes certain entities
40 involved in the provision of health care, governmental entities and certain nonprofit
