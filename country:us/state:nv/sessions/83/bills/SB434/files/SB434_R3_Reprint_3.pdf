11 establishes the Statewide Health Care Access and Recruitment Program Account to
12 hold money to fund the Program. Section 8 authorizes the Director of the
13 Department, with the approval of the Interim Finance Committee, to transfer money
14 from the Account to another account for the purpose of obtaining additional federal
15 financial participation under Medicaid. Section 19 of this bill authorizes the Interim
16 Finance Committee to issue such approval during a legislative session.
17 Section 9 of this bill requires the Department to conduct a biennial assessment
18 of the health care needs of this State, which must identify health care professions
19 and specialties and types of clinical services and expertise and geographic areas
20 experiencing critical shortages of providers of health care or clinical services or

25 grant of money from the Account to support a project to address those critical
26 shortages. Section 10 imposes certain additional requirements for a project to be
27 eligible to receive such funding, including a requirement that the applicant has
28 secured matching financial or in-kind contributions valued at an amount at least
29 equal to the amount of the grant being sought. Section 11 of this bill prescribes the
30 required contents of an application for such a grant. Sections 12 and 13 of the bill
31 prescribe the process for the Department to review applications and, with the
32 approval of the Interim Finance Committee, award grants. Section 19 authorizes
33 the Interim Finance Committee to issue such approval during a legislative session.
34 After a grant is awarded, section 14 of this bill requires the Department to enter
35 into a funding agreement with the grantee that outlines the terms and conditions of
36 the grant and the responsibilities of the grantee. Section 15 of this bill requires a
37 grantee to notify and submit a revised plan to the Department if: (1) the grantee
38 significantly modifies a funded project; (2) the amount of money available for a
39 funded project changes; (3) a funded project becomes inactive for at least 12
40 months; or (4) a funded project is terminated. Section 15 authorizes the Department
41 to take certain actions in response to such notice. Section 16 of this bill authorizes
42 the Department and the Office of Finance to provide certain oversight of a funded
43 project. Section 17 of this bill authorizes the Department to suspend or terminate a
44 grant or take certain other actions if it determines that the grantee has failed to
45 comply with a funding agreement. Section 17 also requires the Department to
46 suspend or terminate a grant if it determines that the grantee has violated applicable
47 law, misused funds or submitted fraudulent information to the Department. Upon
48 the completion of a funded project and again 10 years after the completion of a
49 funded project, section 18 of this bill requires the grantee to submit a report to the
50 Department concerning the project.
