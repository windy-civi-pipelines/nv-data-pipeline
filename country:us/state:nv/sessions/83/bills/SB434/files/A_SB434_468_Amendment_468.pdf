Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Department of Health and Human Services, or divisions thereof,
2 to conduct various programs for the improvement of public health and health care in this
3 State. (NRS 433.702-433.744, 439.4921-439.525, 439.529-439.5297, 439.600-439.690,
4 439A.111-439A.185, 439A.200-439A.290, 442.710-442.745, 457.230-457.280, 458.025,
5 458A.090, 458A.100, 458A.110) This bill establishes the Statewide Health Care Access and
6 Recruitment Grant Program, which is a competitive grant program managed by the
7 Department of Health and Human Services to support projects to address critical shortages of
8 providers of health care or clinical services or expertise in this State. Sections 3-7 of this bill
9 define certain terms, and section 2 of this bill establishes the applicability of those definitions.
10 Section 8 of this bill establishes the Statewide Health Care Access and Recruitment Program
11 Account to hold money to fund the Program. Section 21 of this bill appropriates money into
12 the Account for the purposes of the Program. Section 8 authorizes the Director of the
13 Department, with the approval of the Interim Finance Committee, to transfer money from the
14 Account to another account for the purpose of obtaining additional federal financial

Senate Amendment No. 468 to Senate Bill No. 434 Page 4
15 participation under Medicaid. Section 19 of this bill authorizes the Interim Finance
16 Committee to issue such approval during a legislative session.
17 Existing law: (1) creates the Account to Stabilize the Operation of State Government, also
18 known as the Rainy Day Fund, in the State General Fund; and (2) prescribes a procedure for
19 the transfer of money from that Account to the State General Fund during certain periods of
20 low revenue or fiscal emergency. Existing law requires certain transfers of money to be made
21 from the State General Fund to the Rainy Day Fund, including, without limitation, an annual
22 transfer of 1 percent of the anticipated revenue for the State during the current fiscal year into
23 the Rainy Day Fund. (NRS 353.288) Beginning on July 1, 2027, section 8 requires the State
24 Controller to annually transfer 0.5 percent of the anticipated revenue for the State during the
25 current fiscal year into the Statewide Health Care Access and Recruitment Program Account.
26 However, section 8 prohibits such a transfer if the balance of the Account increases to an
27 amount greater than $60,000,000 and prohibits subsequent transfers until the balance in that
28 Account drops below $30,000,000. Section 20 of this bill reduces the amount that the State
29 Controller is required to transfer to the Rainy Day Fund in fiscal years when the State
30 Controller transfers money to the Statewide Health Care Access and Recruitment Program
31 Account to 0.5 percent of the anticipated revenue for the State during the next fiscal year.
32 Section 8 prohibits a transfer into the Statewide Health Care Access and Recruitment
33 Program Account if the balance of the Rainy Day Fund is less than $1 billion, and
34 section 20 requires the money that would otherwise be transferred into the Account
35 under those circumstances to instead be transferred into the Rainy Day Fund.
36 Section 9 of this bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services to conduct a
37 biennial assessment of the health care needs of this State, which must identify health care
38 professions and specialties and types of clinical services and expertise and geographic areas
39 experiencing critical shortages of providers of health care [.] or clinical services or expertise.
40 Section 21.5 of this bill requires the Department to utilize existing assessments in lieu of
41 conducting the first scheduled assessment on or before July 1, 2026. Section 10 authorizes
42 certain entities involved in the provision of health care, governmental entities and certain
43 nonprofit organizations to apply for a grant of money from the Account to support a project to
44 address those critical shortages. Section 10 imposes certain additional requirements for a
45 project to be eligible to receive such funding, including a requirement that the applicant has
46 secured matching financial or in-kind contributions valued at an amount at least equal to the
47 amount of the grant being sought. Section 11 of this bill prescribes the required contents of an
48 application for such a grant. Sections 12 and 13 of the bill prescribe the process for the
49 Department to review applications and, with the approval of the Interim Finance Committee,
50 award grants. Section 19 authorizes the Interim Finance Committee to issue such approval
51 during a legislative session.
52 After a grant is awarded, section 14 of this bill requires the Department to enter into
53 a funding agreement with the grantee that outlines the terms and conditions of the grant and
54 the responsibilities of the grantee. Section 15 of this bill requires a grantee to notify and
55 submit a revised plan to the Department if: (1) the grantee significantly modifies a funded
56 project; (2) the amount of money available for a funded project changes; (3) a funded project
57 becomes inactive for at least 12 months; or (4) a funded project is terminated. Section 15
58 authorizes the Department to take certain actions in response to such notice. Section 16 of this
59 bill authorizes the Department and the Office of Finance to provide certain oversight of a
60 funded project. Section 17 of this bill authorizes the Department to suspend or terminate a
61 grant or take certain other actions if it determines that the grantee has failed to comply with a
62 funding agreement. Section 17 also requires the Department to suspend or terminate a grant if
63 it determines that the grantee has violated applicable law, misused funds or submitted
64 fraudulent information to the Department. Upon the completion of a funded project and again
65 10 years after the completion of a funded project, section 18 of this bill requires the grantee to
66 submit a report to the Department concerning the project.

1 transfer money to the Statewide Health Care Access and Recruitment Program
2 Account created pursuant to section 8 of this act; or
3 (2) One percent of the total anticipated revenue for the fiscal year in
4 which the transfer will be made, as projected by the Economic Forum for that

40 subsection 5 and shall, if it finds that a transfer should be made, recommend the
41 amount of the transfer to the Interim Finance Committee for its independent
42 evaluation and action. The Interim Finance Committee is not bound to follow the
43 recommendation of the State Board of Examiners.
44 7. If the Interim Finance Committee finds that a transfer recommended by the
45 State Board of Examiners should and may lawfully be made, the Committee shall
46 by resolution establish the amount and direct the State Controller to transfer that
47 amount to the State General Fund. The State Controller shall thereupon make the
48 transfer.
49 8. In addition to the manner of allocation authorized pursuant to subsections
50 5, 6 and 7, the money in the Account to Stabilize the Operation of the State
51 Government may be allocated directly by the Legislature to be used for any other
