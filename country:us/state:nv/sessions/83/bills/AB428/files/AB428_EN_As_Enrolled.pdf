CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to insurance; requiring certain health plans to
include coverage for certain procedures or services for the
preservation of fertility of insureds who have been diagnosed
with breast or ovarian cancer; providing certain exceptions
for insurers affiliated with religious organizations;
authorizing certain expenditures; making an appropriation;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law requires public and private policies of insurance to include certain
coverage. (NRS 287.010, 287.04335, 422.2717-422.272428, 689A.04033-
689A.0465, 689B.030-689B.0379, 689C.1652-689C.169, 689C.425, 695A.184-
695A.1875, 695A.255-695A.265, 695B.1901-695B.1949, 695C.050, 695C.1691-
695C.176, 695G.162-695G.177) Existing law also requires employers to provide
certain benefits to employees, including the coverage required of health insurers, if
the employer provides health benefits for its employees. (NRS 608.1555) Sections
1, 3-9, 11 and 13-15 of this bill require public and private health plans, including
Medicaid and insurance for state and local government employees, to provide
coverage for certain procedures or services that are medically necessary to preserve
fertility for an insured who has been diagnosed with breast or ovarian cancer if: (1)
the cancer may directly or indirectly cause infertility; or (2) the insured is expected
to receive medical treatment for the cancer and the treatment could directly or
indirectly cause infertility. An insurer that is affiliated with a religious organization
is not required to provide the coverage required by sections 1, 3-8 and 11 if the
insurer: (1) objects to providing the coverage on religious grounds; and (2) provides
a written notice to insureds or prospective insureds disclosing that the insurer
refuses to provide such coverage. Section 15.5 of this bill makes an appropriation
to the Division of Health Care Financing and Policy of the Department of Health
and Human Services and authorizes certain expenditures for the costs associated
with providing such coverage under Medicaid pursuant to sections 9 and 15.
Section 2 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner of Insurance to require a
policy of individual health insurance issued by a domestic insurer to a person
residing in another state to contain the coverage required by section 1 in certain
circumstances. Section 12 of this bill makes a conforming change to require the
Director of the Department to administer the provisions of section 15 in the same
manner as other provisions relating to Medicaid.
Section 10 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner to suspend or revoke the
certificate of a health maintenance organization that fails to provide the coverage
required by section 8. The Commissioner is also authorized to take such action
against other health insurers who fail to provide the coverage required by sections
1, 3-8 and 11. (NRS 680A.200)
