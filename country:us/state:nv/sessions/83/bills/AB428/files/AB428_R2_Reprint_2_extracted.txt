EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to insurance; requiring certain health plans to
include coverage for certain procedures or services for the
preservation of fertility of insureds who have been
diagnosed with breast or ovarian cancer; providing certain
exceptions for insurers affiliated with religious
organizations; authorizing certain expenditures; making
an appropriation; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires public and private policies of insurance to include certain
2 coverage. (NRS 287.010, 287.04335, 422.2717-422.272428, 689A.04033-
3 689A.0465, 689B.030-689B.0379, 689C.1652-689C.169, 689C.425, 695A.184-
4 695A.1875, 695A.255-695A.265, 695B.1901-695B.1949, 695C.050, 695C.1691-
5 695C.176, 695G.162-695G.177) Existing law also requires employers to provide
6 certain benefits to employees, including the coverage required of health insurers, if
7 the employer provides health benefits for its employees. (NRS 608.1555) Sections
8 1, 3-9, 11 and 13-15 of this bill require public and private health plans, including
9 Medicaid and insurance for state and local government employees, to provide
10 coverage for certain procedures or services that are medically necessary to preserve
11 fertility for an insured who has been diagnosed with breast or ovarian cancer if: (1)
12 the cancer may directly or indirectly cause infertility; or (2) the insured is expected
13 to receive medical treatment for the cancer and the treatment could directly or
-

14 indirectly cause infertility. An insurer that is affiliated with a religious organization
15 is not required to provide the coverage required by sections 1, 3-8 and 11 if the
16 insurer: (1) objects to providing the coverage on religious grounds; and (2) provides
17 a written notice to insureds or prospective insureds disclosing that the insurer
18 refuses to provide such coverage. Section 15.5 of this bill makes an appropriation
19 to the Division of Health Care Financing and Policy of the Department of Health
20 and Human Services and authorizes certain expenditures for the costs associated
21 with providing such coverage under Medicaid pursuant to sections 9 and 15.
22 Section 2 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner of Insurance to require a
23 policy of individual health insurance issued by a domestic insurer to a person
24 residing in another state to contain the coverage required by section 1 in certain
25 circumstances. Section 12 of this bill makes a conforming change to require the
26 Director of the Department to administer the provisions of section 15 in the same
27 manner as other provisions relating to Medicaid.
28 Section 10 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner to suspend or revoke the
29 certificate of a health maintenance organization that fails to provide the coverage
30 required by section 8. The Commissioner is also authorized to take such action
31 against other health insurers who fail to provide the coverage required by sections
32 1, 3-8 and 11. (NRS 680A.200)

14 organization is suspended, the health maintenance organization shall
15 not, during the period of that suspension, enroll any additional
16 groups or new individual contracts, unless those groups or persons
17 were contracted for before the date of suspension.
18 4. If the certificate of authority of a health maintenance
19 organization is revoked, the organization shall proceed, immediately
20 following the effective date of the order of revocation, to wind up its
21 affairs and shall conduct no further business except as may be
22 essential to the orderly conclusion of the affairs of the organization.
23 It shall engage in no further advertising or solicitation of any kind.
24 The Commissioner may, by written order, permit such further

29 Sec. 11. Chapter 695G of NRS is hereby amended by adding
30 thereto a new section to read as follows:
31 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 4, a managed
32 care organization that issues a health care plan shall include in
33 the plan coverage for any procedure or service for the preservation
34 of fertility consistent with established medical practice or any
35 guidelines published by the American Society for Reproductive
36 Medicine or the American Society of Clinical Oncology, or their
37 successor organizations, that is medically necessary to preserve
38 fertility because the insured has been diagnosed with breast or
39 ovarian cancer and:
40 (a) The cancer may, in the judgment of a provider of health
41 care, directly or indirectly cause infertility; or
42 (b) The insured is expected to receive medical treatment for the
43 cancer and such treatment may directly or indirectly cause

*AB428_R2*

2 directly or indirectly cause infertility if the treatment has a
3 potential side effect of impaired fertility, as established by the
4 American Society of Clinical Oncology or the American Society
5 for Reproductive Medicine, or their successor organizations.
6 3. A managed care organization shall ensure that the benefits
7 required by subsection 1 are made available to an insured through
8 a provider of health care who participates in the network plan of
9 the managed care organization.
10 4. A managed care organization that is affiliated with a
11 religious organization is not required to provide the coverage
12 required by subsection 1 if the managed care organization objects
13 on religious grounds. Such a managed care organization shall,
14 before the issuance of a health care plan that is subject to the
15 requirements of subsection 1 and before the renewal of such a
16 plan, provide to the insured or prospective insured, as applicable,
17 written notice of the coverage that the managed care organization
18 refuses to provide pursuant to this subsection.
19 5. A health care plan that is subject to the provisions of this
20 chapter and is delivered, issued for delivery or renewed on or after
21 January 1, 2026, has the legal effect of including the coverage
22 required by subsection 1, and any provision of the plan or the
23 renewal that conflicts with the provisions of this section is void.
24 6. As used in this section:
25 (a) “Network plan” means a health care plan offered by a
26 managed care organization under which the financing and
27 delivery of medical care, including items and services paid for as

30 organization. The term does not include an arrangement for the
31 financing of premiums.
32 (b) “Provider of health care” has the meaning ascribed to it in
33 NRS 629.031.

FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
CONTAINS UNFUNDED MANDATE (§ 13)
(NOT REQUESTED BY AFFECTED LOCAL GOVERNMENT)
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to insurance; requiring certain health plans to
include coverage for certain procedures or services for the
preservation of fertility of insureds who have been
diagnosed with breast or ovarian cancer; providing certain
exceptions for insurers affiliated with religious
organizations; authorizing certain expenditures; making
an appropriation; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires public and private policies of insurance to include certain
2 coverage. (NRS 287.010, 287.04335, 422.2717-422.272428, 689A.04033-
3 689A.0465, 689B.030-689B.0379, 689C.1652-689C.169, 689C.425, 695A.184-
4 695A.1875, 695A.255-695A.265, 695B.1901-695B.1949, 695C.050, 695C.1691-
5 695C.176, 695G.162-695G.177) Existing law also requires employers to provide
6 certain benefits to employees, including the coverage required of health insurers, if
7 the employer provides health benefits for its employees. (NRS 608.1555) Sections
8 1, 3-9, 11 and 13-15 of this bill require public and private health plans, including
9 Medicaid and insurance for state and local government employees, to provide
10 coverage for certain procedures or services that are medically necessary to preserve
11 fertility for an insured who has been diagnosed with breast or ovarian cancer if: (1)
12 the cancer may directly or indirectly cause infertility; or (2) the insured is expected
13 to receive medical treatment for the cancer and the treatment could directly or
-
*AB428_R2*

– 2 –
14 indirectly cause infertility. An insurer that is affiliated with a religious organization
15 is not required to provide the coverage required by sections 1, 3-8 and 11 if the
16 insurer: (1) objects to providing the coverage on religious grounds; and (2) provides
17 a written notice to insureds or prospective insureds disclosing that the insurer
18 refuses to provide such coverage. Section 15.5 of this bill makes an appropriation
19 to the Division of Health Care Financing and Policy of the Department of Health
20 and Human Services and authorizes certain expenditures for the costs associated
21 with providing such coverage under Medicaid pursuant to sections 9 and 15.
22 Section 2 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner of Insurance to require a
23 policy of individual health insurance issued by a domestic insurer to a person
24 residing in another state to contain the coverage required by section 1 in certain
25 circumstances. Section 12 of this bill makes a conforming change to require the
26 Director of the Department to administer the provisions of section 15 in the same
27 manner as other provisions relating to Medicaid.
28 Section 10 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner to suspend or revoke the
29 certificate of a health maintenance organization that fails to provide the coverage
30 required by section 8. The Commissioner is also authorized to take such action
31 against other health insurers who fail to provide the coverage required by sections
32 1, 3-8 and 11. (NRS 680A.200)
