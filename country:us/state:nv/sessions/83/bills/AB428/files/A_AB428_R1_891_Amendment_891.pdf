AN ACT relating to insurance; requiring certain health plans to include coverage
for certain procedures or services for the preservation of fertility of
insureds who have been diagnosed with breast or ovarian cancer;
providing certain exceptions for insurers affiliated with religious
organizations; authorizing certain expenditures; making an
appropriation; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires public and private policies of insurance to include certain coverage.
2 (NRS 287.010, 287.04335, 422.2717-422.272428, 689A.04033-689A.0465, 689B.030-
3 689B.0379, 689C.1652-689C.169, 689C.425, 695A.184-695A.1875, 695A.255-695A.265,
4 695B.1901-695B.1949, 695C.050, 695C.1691-695C.176, 695G.162-695G.177) Existing law
5 also requires employers to provide certain benefits to employees, including the coverage
6 required of health insurers, if the employer provides health benefits for its employees. (NRS
7 608.1555) Sections 1, 3-9, 11 and 13-15 of this bill require public and private health plans,
8 including Medicaid and insurance for state and local government employees, to provide
9 coverage for certain procedures or services that are medically necessary to preserve fertility
10 for an insured who has been diagnosed with breast or ovarian cancer if: (1) the cancer may
11 directly or indirectly cause infertility; or (2) the insured is expected to receive medical
12 treatment for the cancer and the treatment could directly or indirectly cause infertility. An
13 insurer that is affiliated with a religious organization is not required to provide the coverage
14 required by sections 1, 3-8 and 11 if the insurer: (1) objects to providing the coverage on
15 religious grounds; and (2) provides a written notice to insureds or prospective insureds
16 disclosing that the insurer refuses to provide such coverage. Section 15.5 of this bill makes
17 an appropriation to the Division of Health Care Financing and Policy of the Department
18 of Health and Human Services and authorizes certain expenditures for the costs
19 associated with providing such coverage under Medicaid pursuant to sections 9 and 15.

Assembly Amendment No. 891 to Assembly Bill No. 428 First Reprint Page 4
20 Section 2 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner of Insurance to require a policy of
21 individual health insurance issued by a domestic insurer to a person residing in another state
22 to contain the coverage required by section 1 in certain circumstances. Section 12 of this bill
23 makes a conforming change to require the Director of the Department [of Health and Human
24 Services] to administer the provisions of section 15 in the same manner as other provisions
25 relating to Medicaid.
26 Section 10 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner to suspend or revoke the certificate of
27 a health maintenance organization that fails to provide the coverage required by section 8.
28 The Commissioner is also authorized to take such action against other health insurers who fail
29 to provide the coverage required by sections 1, 3-8 and 11. (NRS 680A.200)

28 suspended, the health maintenance organization shall not, during the period of that
29 suspension, enroll any additional groups or new individual contracts, unless those
30 groups or persons were contracted for before the date of suspension.
31 4. If the certificate of authority of a health maintenance organization is
32 revoked, the organization shall proceed, immediately following the effective date of
33 the order of revocation, to wind up its affairs and shall conduct no further business
34 except as may be essential to the orderly conclusion of the affairs of the
35 organization. It shall engage in no further advertising or solicitation of any kind.
36 The Commissioner may, by written order, permit such further operation of the
37 organization as the Commissioner may find to be in the best interest of enrollees to
38 the end that enrollees are afforded the greatest practical opportunity to obtain
39 continuing coverage for health care.
40 Sec. 11. Chapter 695G of NRS is hereby amended by adding thereto a new
41 section to read as follows:
42 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 4, a managed care
43 organization that issues a health care plan shall include in the plan coverage for
44 any procedure or service for the preservation of fertility consistent with
45 established medical practice or any guidelines published by the American Society
46 for Reproductive Medicine or the American Society of Clinical Oncology, or their
47 successor organizations, that is medically necessary to preserve fertility because
48 the insured has been diagnosed with breast or ovarian cancer and:
49 (a) The cancer may, in the judgment of a provider of health care, directly or
50 indirectly cause infertility; or
51 (b) The insured is expected to receive medical treatment for the cancer and
52 such treatment may directly or indirectly cause infertility.

Assembly Amendment No. 891 to Assembly Bill No. 428 First Reprint Page 11
1 2. For the purposes of subsection 1, a medical treatment may directly or
2 indirectly cause infertility if the treatment has a potential side effect of impaired
3 fertility, as established by the American Society of Clinical Oncology or the
4 American Society for Reproductive Medicine, or their successor organizations.
5 3. A managed care organization shall ensure that the benefits required by
6 subsection 1 are made available to an insured through a provider of health care
7 who participates in the network plan of the managed care organization.
8 4. A managed care organization that is affiliated with a religious
9 organization is not required to provide the coverage required by subsection 1 if
10 the managed care organization objects on religious grounds. Such a managed
11 care organization shall, before the issuance of a health care plan that is subject
12 to the requirements of subsection 1 and before the renewal of such a plan,
13 provide to the insured or prospective insured, as applicable, written notice of the
14 coverage that the managed care organization refuses to provide pursuant to this
15 subsection.
16 5. A health care plan that is subject to the provisions of this chapter and is
17 delivered, issued for delivery or renewed on or after January 1, 2026, has the
18 legal effect of including the coverage required by subsection 1, and any provision
19 of the plan or the renewal that conflicts with the provisions of this section is void.
20 6. As used in this section:
21 (a) “Network plan” means a health care plan offered by a managed care
22 organization under which the financing and delivery of medical care, including
23 items and services paid for as medical care, are provided, in whole or in part,
24 through a defined set of providers under contract with the managed care
25 organization. The term does not include an arrangement for the financing of
26 premiums.
27 (b) “Provider of health care” has the meaning ascribed to it in NRS 629.031.
