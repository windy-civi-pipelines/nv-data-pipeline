relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires public and private policies of insurance to include certain
2 coverage. (NRS 287.010, 287.04335, 422.2717-422.272428, 689A.04033-
3 689A.0465, 689B.030-689B.0379, 689C.1652-689C.169, 689C.425, 695A.184-
4 695A.1875, 695A.255-695A.265, 695B.1901-695B.1949, 695C.050, 695C.1691-
5 695C.176, 695G.162-695G.177) Existing law also requires employers to provide
6 certain benefits to employees, including the coverage required of health insurers, if
7 the employer provides health benefits for its employees. (NRS 608.1555) Sections
8 1, 3-9, 11 and 13-15 of this bill require public and private health plans, including
9 Medicaid and insurance for state and local government employees, to provide
10 coverage for certain procedures or services that are medically necessary to preserve
11 fertility for an insured who has been diagnosed with breast or ovarian cancer if: (1)
12 the cancer may directly or indirectly cause infertility; or (2) the insured is expected
13 to receive medical treatment for the cancer and the treatment could directly or
14 indirectly cause infertility. An insurer that is affiliated with a religious organization

15 is not required to provide the coverage required by sections 1, 3-8 and 11 if the
16 insurer: (1) objects to providing the coverage on religious grounds; and (2) provides
17 a written notice to insureds or prospective insureds disclosing that the insurer
18 refuses to provide such coverage.
19 Section 2 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner of Insurance to require a
20 policy of individual health insurance issued by a domestic insurer to a person
21 residing in another state to contain the coverage required by section 1 in certain
22 circumstances. Section 12 of this bill makes a conforming change to require the
23 Director of the Department of Health and Human Services to administer the
24 provisions of section 15 in the same manner as other provisions relating to
25 Medicaid.
26 Section 10 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner to suspend or revoke the
27 certificate of a health maintenance organization that fails to provide the coverage
28 required by section 8. The Commissioner is also authorized to take such action
29 against other health insurers who fail to provide the coverage required by sections
30 1, 3-8 and 11. (NRS 680A.200)

16 (k) The health maintenance organization has otherwise failed to
17 comply substantially with the provisions of this chapter.
18 2. A certificate of authority must be suspended or revoked only
19 after compliance with the requirements of NRS 695C.340.
20 3. If the certificate of authority of a health maintenance
21 organization is suspended, the health maintenance organization shall
22 not, during the period of that suspension, enroll any additional
23 groups or new individual contracts, unless those groups or persons
24 were contracted for before the date of suspension.
25 4. If the certificate of authority of a health maintenance
26 organization is revoked, the organization shall proceed, immediately
27 following the effective date of the order of revocation, to wind up its
28 affairs and shall conduct no further business except as may be
29 essential to the orderly conclusion of the affairs of the organization.
30 It shall engage in no further advertising or solicitation of any kind.
31 The Commissioner may, by written order, permit such further
32 operation of the organization as the Commissioner may find to be in
33 the best interest of enrollees to the end that enrollees are afforded
34 the greatest practical opportunity to obtain continuing coverage for
35 health care.
36 Sec. 11. Chapter 695G of NRS is hereby amended by adding
37 thereto a new section to read as follows:
38 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 4, a managed
39 care organization that issues a health care plan shall include in
40 the plan coverage for any procedure or service for the preservation
41 of fertility consistent with established medical practice or any
42 guidelines published by the American Society for Reproductive
43 Medicine or the American Society of Clinical Oncology, or their
44 successor organizations, that is medically necessary to preserve
-
*AB428*
– 12 –
1 fertility because the insured has been diagnosed with breast or
2 ovarian cancer and:
3 (a) The cancer may, in the judgment of a provider of health
4 care, directly or indirectly cause infertility; or
5 (b) The insured is expected to receive medical treatment for the
6 cancer and such treatment may directly or indirectly cause
7 infertility.
8 2. For the purposes of subsection 1, a medical treatment may
9 directly or indirectly cause infertility if the treatment has a
10 potential side effect of impaired fertility, as established by the
11 American Society of Clinical Oncology or the American Society
12 for Reproductive Medicine, or their successor organizations.
13 3. A managed care organization shall ensure that the benefits
14 required by subsection 1 are made available to an insured through
15 a provider of health care who participates in the network plan of
16 the managed care organization.
17 4. A managed care organization that is affiliated with a
18 religious organization is not required to provide the coverage
19 required by subsection 1 if the managed care organization objects
20 on religious grounds. Such a managed care organization shall,
21 before the issuance of a health care plan that is subject to the
22 requirements of subsection 1 and before the renewal of such a
23 plan, provide to the insured or prospective insured, as applicable,
24 written notice of the coverage that the managed care organization
25 refuses to provide pursuant to this subsection.
26 5. A health care plan that is subject to the provisions of this
27 chapter and is delivered, issued for delivery or renewed on or after
28 January 1, 2026, has the legal effect of including the coverage
29 required by subsection 1, and any provision of the plan or the
30 renewal that conflicts with the provisions of this section is void.
31 6. As used in this section:
32 (a) “Network plan” means a health care plan offered by a
33 managed care organization under which the financing and
34 delivery of medical care, including items and services paid for as
35 medical care, are provided, in whole or in part, through a defined
36 set of providers under contract with the managed care
37 organization. The term does not include an arrangement for the
38 financing of premiums.
39 (b) “Provider of health care” has the meaning ascribed to it in
40 NRS 629.031.
41 Sec. 12. NRS 232.320 is hereby amended to read as follows:

relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires public and private policies of insurance to include certain
2 coverage. (NRS 287.010, 287.04335, 422.2717-422.272428, 689A.04033-
3 689A.0465, 689B.030-689B.0379, 689C.1652-689C.169, 689C.425, 695A.184-
4 695A.1875, 695A.255-695A.265, 695B.1901-695B.1949, 695C.050, 695C.1691-
5 695C.176, 695G.162-695G.177) Existing law also requires employers to provide
6 certain benefits to employees, including the coverage required of health insurers, if
7 the employer provides health benefits for its employees. (NRS 608.1555) Sections
8 1, 3-9, 11 and 13-15 of this bill require public and private health plans, including
9 Medicaid and insurance for state and local government employees, to provide
10 coverage for certain procedures or services that are medically necessary to preserve
11 fertility for an insured who has been diagnosed with breast or ovarian cancer if: (1)
12 the cancer may directly or indirectly cause infertility; or (2) the insured is expected
13 to receive medical treatment for the cancer and the treatment could directly or
14 indirectly cause infertility. An insurer that is affiliated with a religious organization

15 is not required to provide the coverage required by sections 1, 3-8 and 11 if the
16 insurer: (1) objects to providing the coverage on religious grounds; and (2) provides
17 a written notice to insureds or prospective insureds disclosing that the insurer
18 refuses to provide such coverage.
19 Section 2 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner of Insurance to require a
20 policy of individual health insurance issued by a domestic insurer to a person
21 residing in another state to contain the coverage required by section 1 in certain
22 circumstances. Section 12 of this bill makes a conforming change to require the
23 Director of the Department of Health and Human Services to administer the
24 provisions of section 15 in the same manner as other provisions relating to
25 Medicaid.
26 Section 10 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner to suspend or revoke the
27 certificate of a health maintenance organization that fails to provide the coverage
28 required by section 8. The Commissioner is also authorized to take such action
29 against other health insurers who fail to provide the coverage required by sections
30 1, 3-8 and 11. (NRS 680A.200)

– 12 –

2 ovarian cancer and:
3 (a) The cancer may, in the judgment of a provider of health
4 care, directly or indirectly cause infertility; or
5 (b) The insured is expected to receive medical treatment for the
6 cancer and such treatment may directly or indirectly cause
7 infertility.
8 2. For the purposes of subsection 1, a medical treatment may
9 directly or indirectly cause infertility if the treatment has a

11 American Society of Clinical Oncology or the American Society
12 for Reproductive Medicine, or their successor organizations.
13 3. A managed care organization shall ensure that the benefits
14 required by subsection 1 are made available to an insured through
15 a provider of health care who participates in the network plan of
16 the managed care organization.
17 4. A managed care organization that is affiliated with a
18 religious organization is not required to provide the coverage
19 required by subsection 1 if the managed care organization objects
20 on religious grounds. Such a managed care organization shall,

22 requirements of subsection 1 and before the renewal of such a
23 plan, provide to the insured or prospective insured, as applicable,
24 written notice of the coverage that the managed care organization
25 refuses to provide pursuant to this subsection.
26 5. A health care plan that is subject to the provisions of this
27 chapter and is delivered, issued for delivery or renewed on or after
28 January 1, 2026, has the legal effect of including the coverage
29 required by subsection 1, and any provision of the plan or the
30 renewal that conflicts with the provisions of this section is void.
31 6. As used in this section:
32 (a) “Network plan” means a health care plan offered by a
33 managed care organization under which the financing and
34 delivery of medical care, including items and services paid for as
35 medical care, are provided, in whole or in part, through a defined
36 set of providers under contract with the managed care
37 organization. The term does not include an arrangement for the
38 financing of premiums.
39 (b) “Provider of health care” has the meaning ascribed to it in
40 NRS 629.031.
41 Sec. 12. NRS 232.320 is hereby amended to read as follows:
