include coverage for certain procedures or services for the
preservation of fertility of insureds who have been
diagnosed with breast or ovarian cancer; providing certain
exceptions for insurers affiliated with religious

relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires public and private policies of insurance to include certain
2 coverage. (NRS 287.010, 287.04335, 422.2717-422.272428, 689A.04033-
3 689A.0465, 689B.030-689B.0379, 689C.1652-689C.169, 689C.425, 695A.184-
4 695A.1875, 695A.255-695A.265, 695B.1901-695B.1949, 695C.050, 695C.1691-
5 695C.176, 695G.162-695G.177) Existing law also requires employers to provide
6 certain benefits to employees, including the coverage required of health insurers, if
7 the employer provides health benefits for its employees. (NRS 608.1555) Sections
8 1, 3-9, 11 and 13-15 of this bill require public and private health plans, including
9 Medicaid and insurance for state and local government employees, to provide
10 coverage for certain procedures or services that are medically necessary to preserve
11 fertility for an insured who has been diagnosed with breast or ovarian cancer if: (1)
12 the cancer may directly or indirectly cause infertility; or (2) the insured is expected
13 to receive medical treatment for the cancer and the treatment could directly or
14 indirectly cause infertility. An insurer that is affiliated with a religious organization

15 is not required to provide the coverage required by sections 1, 3-8 and 11 if the
16 insurer: (1) objects to providing the coverage on religious grounds; and (2) provides
17 a written notice to insureds or prospective insureds disclosing that the insurer
18 refuses to provide such coverage.
19 Section 2 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner of Insurance to require a
20 policy of individual health insurance issued by a domestic insurer to a person
21 residing in another state to contain the coverage required by section 1 in certain
22 circumstances. Section 12 of this bill makes a conforming change to require the
23 Director of the Department of Health and Human Services to administer the
24 provisions of section 15 in the same manner as other provisions relating to
25 Medicaid.
26 Section 10 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner to suspend or revoke the
27 certificate of a health maintenance organization that fails to provide the coverage
28 required by section 8. The Commissioner is also authorized to take such action
29 against other health insurers who fail to provide the coverage required by sections
30 1, 3-8 and 11. (NRS 680A.200)

18 The Commissioner may, by written order, permit such further
19 operation of the organization as the Commissioner may find to be in

21 the greatest practical opportunity to obtain continuing coverage for
22 health care.
23 Sec. 11. Chapter 695G of NRS is hereby amended by adding
24 thereto a new section to read as follows:
25 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 4, a managed
26 care organization that issues a health care plan shall include in
27 the plan coverage for any procedure or service for the preservation
28 of fertility consistent with established medical practice or any
29 guidelines published by the American Society for Reproductive
30 Medicine or the American Society of Clinical Oncology, or their
31 successor organizations, that is medically necessary to preserve
32 fertility because the insured has been diagnosed with breast or
33 ovarian cancer and:
34 (a) The cancer may, in the judgment of a provider of health
35 care, directly or indirectly cause infertility; or
36 (b) The insured is expected to receive medical treatment for the
37 cancer and such treatment may directly or indirectly cause
38 infertility.
39 2. For the purposes of subsection 1, a medical treatment may

41 potential side effect of impaired fertility, as established by the
42 American Society of Clinical Oncology or the American Society
43 for Reproductive Medicine, or their successor organizations.
44 3. A managed care organization shall ensure that the benefits
45 required by subsection 1 are made available to an insured through

1 a provider of health care who participates in the network plan of
2 the managed care organization.
3 4. A managed care organization that is affiliated with a
4 religious organization is not required to provide the coverage
5 required by subsection 1 if the managed care organization objects
6 on religious grounds. Such a managed care organization shall,
7 before the issuance of a health care plan that is subject to the
8 requirements of subsection 1 and before the renewal of such a
9 plan, provide to the insured or prospective insured, as applicable,
10 written notice of the coverage that the managed care organization
11 refuses to provide pursuant to this subsection.
12 5. A health care plan that is subject to the provisions of this
13 chapter and is delivered, issued for delivery or renewed on or after
14 January 1, 2026, has the legal effect of including the coverage
15 required by subsection 1, and any provision of the plan or the
16 renewal that conflicts with the provisions of this section is void.
17 6. As used in this section:
18 (a) “Network plan” means a health care plan offered by a
19 managed care organization under which the financing and
20 delivery of medical care, including items and services paid for as
21 medical care, are provided, in whole or in part, through a defined
22 set of providers under contract with the managed care
23 organization. The term does not include an arrangement for the
24 financing of premiums.
25 (b) “Provider of health care” has the meaning ascribed to it in
26 NRS 629.031.
27 Sec. 12. NRS 232.320 is hereby amended to read as follows:
