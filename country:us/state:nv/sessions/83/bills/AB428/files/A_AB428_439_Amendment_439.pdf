EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to insurance; requiring certain health plans to include coverage
for certain procedures or services for the preservation of fertility of
insureds who have been diagnosed with breast or ovarian cancer;
providing certain exceptions for insurers affiliated with religious
organizations; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires public and private policies of insurance to include certain coverage.
2 (NRS 287.010, 287.04335, 422.2717-422.272428, 689A.04033-689A.0465, 689B.030-
3 689B.0379, 689C.1652-689C.169, 689C.425, 695A.184-695A.1875, 695A.255-695A.265,
4 695B.1901-695B.1949, 695C.050, 695C.1691-695C.176, 695G.162-695G.177) Existing law
5 also requires employers to provide certain benefits to employees, including the coverage
6 required of health insurers, if the employer provides health benefits for its employees. (NRS
7 608.1555) Sections 1, 3-9, 11 and 13-15 of this bill require public and private health plans,
8 including Medicaid and insurance for state and local government employees, to provide
9 coverage for certain procedures or services that are medically necessary to preserve fertility
10 for an insured who has been diagnosed with breast or ovarian cancer if: (1) the cancer may
11 directly or indirectly cause infertility; or (2) the insured is expected to receive medical
12 treatment for the cancer and the treatment could directly or indirectly cause infertility. An
13 insurer that is affiliated with a religious organization is not required to provide the coverage
14 required by sections 1, 3-8 and 11 if the insurer: (1) objects to providing the coverage on
15 religious grounds; and (2) provides a written notice to insureds or prospective insureds
16 disclosing that the insurer refuses to provide such coverage.
17 Section 2 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner of Insurance to require a policy of
18 individual health insurance issued by a domestic insurer to a person residing in another state
19 to contain the coverage required by section 1 in certain circumstances. Section 12 of this bill
20 makes a conforming change to require the Director of the Department of Health and Human
21 Services to administer the provisions of section 15 in the same manner as other provisions
22 relating to Medicaid.

Assembly Amendment No. 439 to Assembly Bill No. 428 Page 4
23 Section 10 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner to suspend or revoke the certificate of
24 a health maintenance organization that fails to provide the coverage required by section 8.
25 The Commissioner is also authorized to take such action against other health insurers who fail
26 to provide the coverage required by sections 1, 3-8 and 11. (NRS 680A.200)

35 compliance with the requirements of NRS 695C.340.
36 3. If the certificate of authority of a health maintenance organization is
37 suspended, the health maintenance organization shall not, during the period of that
38 suspension, enroll any additional groups or new individual contracts, unless those
39 groups or persons were contracted for before the date of suspension.
40 4. If the certificate of authority of a health maintenance organization is
41 revoked, the organization shall proceed, immediately following the effective date of
42 the order of revocation, to wind up its affairs and shall conduct no further business
43 except as may be essential to the orderly conclusion of the affairs of the
44 organization. It shall engage in no further advertising or solicitation of any kind.
45 The Commissioner may, by written order, permit such further operation of the
46 organization as the Commissioner may find to be in the best interest of enrollees to
47 the end that enrollees are afforded the greatest practical opportunity to obtain
48 continuing coverage for health care.
49 Sec. 11. Chapter 695G of NRS is hereby amended by adding thereto a new
50 section to read as follows:
51 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 4, a managed care
52 organization that issues a health care plan shall include in the plan coverage for
53 any procedure or service for the preservation of fertility consistent with

Assembly Amendment No. 439 to Assembly Bill No. 428 Page 11
1 established medical practice or any guidelines published by the American Society
2 for Reproductive Medicine or the American Society of Clinical Oncology, or their
3 successor organizations, that is medically necessary to preserve fertility because
4 the insured has been diagnosed with breast or ovarian cancer and:
5 (a) The cancer may, in the judgment of a provider of health care, directly or
6 indirectly cause infertility; or
7 (b) The insured is expected to receive medical treatment for the cancer and
8 such treatment may directly or indirectly cause infertility.
9 2. For the purposes of subsection 1, a medical treatment may directly or
10 indirectly cause infertility if the treatment has a potential side effect of impaired
11 fertility, as established by the American Society of Clinical Oncology or the
12 American Society for Reproductive Medicine, or their successor organizations.
13 3. A managed care organization shall ensure that the benefits required by
14 subsection 1 are made available to an insured through a provider of health care
15 who participates in the network plan of the managed care organization.
16 4. A managed care organization that is affiliated with a religious
17 organization is not required to provide the coverage required by subsection 1 if
18 the managed care organization objects on religious grounds. Such a managed
19 care organization shall, before the issuance of a health care plan that is subject
20 to the requirements of subsection 1 and before the renewal of such a plan,
21 provide to the insured or prospective insured, as applicable, written notice of the
22 coverage that the managed care organization refuses to provide pursuant to this
23 subsection.
24 5. A health care plan that is subject to the provisions of this chapter and is
25 delivered, issued for delivery or renewed on or after January 1, 2026, has the
26 legal effect of including the coverage required by subsection 1, and any provision
27 of the plan or the renewal that conflicts with the provisions of this section is void.
28 6. As used in this section:
29 (a) “Network plan” means a health care plan offered by a managed care
30 organization under which the financing and delivery of medical care, including
31 items and services paid for as medical care, are provided, in whole or in part,
32 through a defined set of providers under contract with the managed care
33 organization. The term does not include an arrangement for the financing of
34 premiums.
35 (b) “Provider of health care” has the meaning ascribed to it in NRS 629.031.
36 Sec. 12. NRS 232.320 is hereby amended to read as follows:
37 232.320 1. The Director:

36 Sec. 13. NRS 287.010 is hereby amended to read as follows:
37 287.010 1. The governing body of any county, school district, municipal
38 corporation, political subdivision, public corporation or other local governmental
39 agency of the State of Nevada may:
40 (a) Adopt and carry into effect a system of group life, accident or health
41 insurance, or any combination thereof, for the benefit of its officers and employees,
42 and the dependents of officers and employees who elect to accept the insurance and
43 who, where necessary, have authorized the governing body to make deductions
44 from their compensation for the payment of premiums on the insurance.
45 (b) Purchase group policies of life, accident or health insurance, or any
46 combination thereof, for the benefit of such officers and employees, and the
47 dependents of such officers and employees, as have authorized the purchase, from

50 and employees the premiums upon insurance and pay the deductions upon the
51 premiums.

4 must be maintained as an internal service fund as defined by NRS 354.543. The
5 money must be deposited in a state or national bank or credit union authorized to
6 transact business in the State of Nevada. Any independent administrator of a fund
7 created under this section is subject to the licensing requirements of chapter 683A
8 of NRS, and must be a resident of this State. Any contract with an independent
9 administrator must be approved by the Commissioner of Insurance as to the

27 (b) The recipient is expected to receive medical treatment for the cancer and
