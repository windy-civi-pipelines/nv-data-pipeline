EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to insurance; requiring certain policies of health
insurance to include coverage for certain alternatives to
opioids; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires public and private policies of insurance regulated under
2 Nevada law and employers who provide such insurance for their employees to
3 include coverage for drugs to: (1) support safe withdrawal from substance use
4 disorder; and (2) provide medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder.
5 (NRS 287.010, 287.04335, 422.4025, 608.1555, 689A.0459, 689B.0319,
6 689C.1665, 695A.1874, 695B.19197, 695C.050, 695C.1699, 695G.1719) Sections
7 2, 4-10 and 12-15 of this bill require certain public and private policies of health
8 insurance to cover drugs that are alternatives to opioids for purposes for which
9 opioids are commonly used. Sections 1, 2, 4-10, 12-14 and 16 of this bill: (1)
10 prohibit certain insurers from imposing certain other conditions on covered opioid
11 alternatives that are not imposed on opioids; and (2) require such an insurer to
12 exempt an insured from medical management techniques that would otherwise
13 apply to an alternative to an opioid if the provider of health care prescribing or
14 administering the alternative confirms that the alternative is an appropriate
15 treatment for the patient. Section 3 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner of
16 Insurance to require certain policies of health insurance issued by a domestic
17 insurer to a person who resides in another state to include the coverage required by
18 section 2. Section 11 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner to suspend or revoke
19 the certification of a health maintenance organization that fails to comply with the
20 requirements of section 9. The Commissioner would also be authorized to take
21 such actions against other health insurers who fail to comply with the requirements
22 of sections 2, 4-10 and 12. (NRS 680A.200)

13 determination of:
14 (a) Whether a class of therapeutic prescription drugs is included
15 on the list of preferred prescription drugs and is excluded from any
16 restrictions that are imposed by the Medicaid program on drugs that
17 are on the list of preferred prescription drugs;
18 (b) Which therapeutically equivalent prescription drugs will be
19 reviewed for inclusion on the list of preferred prescription drugs and

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to insurance; requiring certain policies of health
insurance to include coverage for certain alternatives to
opioids; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires public and private policies of insurance regulated under
2 Nevada law and employers who provide such insurance for their employees to
3 include coverage for drugs to: (1) support safe withdrawal from substance use
4 disorder; and (2) provide medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder.
5 (NRS 287.010, 287.04335, 422.4025, 608.1555, 689A.0459, 689B.0319,
6 689C.1665, 695A.1874, 695B.19197, 695C.050, 695C.1699, 695G.1719) Sections
7 2, 4-10 and 12-15 of this bill require certain public and private policies of health
8 insurance to cover drugs that are alternatives to opioids for purposes for which
9 opioids are commonly used. Sections 1, 2, 4-10, 12-14 and 16 of this bill: (1)
10 prohibit certain insurers from imposing certain other conditions on covered opioid
11 alternatives that are not imposed on opioids; and (2) require such an insurer to
12 exempt an insured from medical management techniques that would otherwise
13 apply to an alternative to an opioid if the provider of health care prescribing or
14 administering the alternative confirms that the alternative is an appropriate
15 treatment for the patient. Section 3 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner of
16 Insurance to require certain policies of health insurance issued by a domestic
17 insurer to a person who resides in another state to include the coverage required by
18 section 2. Section 11 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner to suspend or revoke
19 the certification of a health maintenance organization that fails to comply with the
20 requirements of section 9. The Commissioner would also be authorized to take
21 such actions against other health insurers who fail to comply with the requirements
22 of sections 2, 4-10 and 12. (NRS 680A.200)
