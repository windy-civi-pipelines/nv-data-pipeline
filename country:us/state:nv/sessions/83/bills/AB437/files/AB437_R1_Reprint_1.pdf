11 Any regulation adopted pursuant to this subsection must, if the

23 income or any commission of a producer of insurance.
24 4. If the Commissioner determines at any time that the
25 Association is or may become unable to meet the financial
26 obligations of the Association, the Commissioner shall direct the

28 amount which is sufficient to restore the ability of the Association
29 to meet its obligations.
30 5. The Association may abate or defer, in whole or in part, a
31 fee assessed to an Association member if, in the opinion of the
32 Board, payment of the fee would endanger the solvency of the
33 Association member. The Association may assess the amount of
34 any fee or part of a fee which is abated or deferred pursuant to
35 this subsection against other Association members.
