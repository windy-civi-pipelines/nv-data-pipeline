Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law requires, under certain circumstances, a person to provide certain
information to vote in person, which may include depending on the circumstances,
the voter’s signature, proof of residency and identify, answering questions covering
the voter’s personal data or providing additional personal data. (NRS 293.2725,

Section 2:
293.277, 293.285, 293.303, 293.3081, 293.3082, 293.3085, 293.3585, 293.541,
293C.270, 293C.275, 293C.292, 293C.3035, 293C.3585) Section 1.4 of this bill
requires that, in order to vote in person in any election, a registered voter verify his
-

or her identity by presenting certain forms of photo identification. If a registered
voter does not have a form of photo identification, section 1.4 authorizes the
registered voter to cast a provisional ballot. Sections 5.28-5.32 of this bill require
such a voter to provide photo identification not later than 5 p.m. on the Friday
following election day in order for such a provisional ballot to be counted.

Section 3:
Sections 5.14-5.24 and 9.12-9.2 of this bill make conforming changes to the
requirement that voters present photo identification to vote in person, including
eliminating existing requirements for the signatures of voters to be verified for in
person voting.

Section 4:
Sections 5.26 and 9.22 of this bill apply the requirement for voters to show
photo identification to voting at polling places established as vote centers.

Section 5:
Sections 5.34, 5.36, 9.24 and 9.26 of this bill apply the requirement for voters
to show photo identification to the period for early voting.

Section 6:
Section 1.6 of this bill requires the Department of Motor Vehicles to issue an
identification card at no charge to certain registered voters who are experiencing a
financial hardship.

Section 7:
Section 1.8 of this bill requires the Secretary of State to issue a digital
identification card at no charge to a registered voter. Section 9.5 provides that the
Secretary of State is not required to issue such digital identification cards until
January 1, 2028.
Existing law: (1) requires a general election to be held on the first Tuesday after
the first Monday of November in each even-numbered year; and (2) provides that
the period for early voting by personal appearance begins the third Saturday
preceding a general election and extends through the Friday before election day.
(NRS 293.12755, 293.3568) Existing law further requires each county clerk to
establish: (1) a certain number of polling places where a person can vote during the
period for early voting by personal appearance and on the day of the general
election; and (2) a ballot drop box at every polling place in the county, including a
polling place for early voting. (NRS 293.269921, 293.2731, 293.3564) Section 1.84
of this bill: (1) requires each county clerk in certain counties to, for the period
beginning on the day after the last day for early voting by personal appearance and
ending on the day before the day of the general election, establish a certain number
of locations where a voter may return his or her mail ballot in a mail ballot drop
box; and (2) requires such locations to be open for at least 7 hours each day, but not
more than 12 hours each day, during that period. Specifically, in a county whose
population is 700,000 or more (currently only Clark County), a county is required
to establish 10 such locations, and in a county whose population is 100,000 or more
but less than 700,000 (currently only Washoe County), a county clerk is required to
establish 5 such locations. Section 1.84 further authorizes a county clerk in a
county whose population is less than 100,000 (currently all counties other than
Clark and Washoe Counties) to establish any number of such locations and
prescribe the hours for such locations to be open. Each location that is established
by a county clerk pursuant to section 1.84 must be at a polling place that is used for
early voting by personal appearance or a polling place for voting in person on the
day of the election.

Section 8:
Section 4.6 of this bill provides that a mail ballot dropped in a mail ballot drop
box pursuant to section 1.84 counts as a vote in the general election. Section 4.8 of
this bill makes a conforming change to make certain provisions relating to mail
ballots generally applicable to section 1.84.
Existing law requires a ballot drop box to meet certain requirements, including
a requirement for the ballot drop box to be made available for use during the hours
when the office of the county or city clerk or the polling place is open for business
or voting, as applicable. (NRS 293.269921, 293C.26321) Sections 4.6 and 8.7 of
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 3 –
this bill require a ballot drop box to be: (1) monitored at all times during such a
period; and (2) secured during any period of time in which the ballot drop box is
not available for use. Sections 4.6 and 8.7 additionally require the Secretary of
State to adopt regulations to establish requirements for monitoring and securing
ballot drop boxes.
Existing law authorizes, at the request of a voter whose mail ballot has been
prepared by or on behalf of the voter, a person authorized by the voter to return the
mail ballot on behalf of the voter by mail or personal delivery to the county clerk,
or any ballot drop box established in the county by the county clerk. (NRS

Section 9:
293.269923) Section 4.7 of this bill additionally authorizes a person, under such
circumstances, to return a mail ballot on behalf of a voter by returning the mail
ballot to a mail ballot drop box established pursuant to section 1.84.

Section 10:
Section 2 of this bill requires the Secretary of State to establish and maintain a
voter services portal on the Internet website of the Office of the Secretary of State,
which must allow any registered voter in the State to: (1) review his or her voter
registration information; (2) print any form necessary to update his or her voter
registration information; (3) view his or her sample ballot; and (4) obtain the
location of any polling place where the registered voter may vote or deliver a mail
ballot to a ballot drop box. Section 2 further requires the county clerk to include on
any communication to a registered voter a two-dimensional barcode, commonly
known as a QR code, or another machine-readable code used for storing the
Internet address for the voter services portal created by the Secretary of State.
Existing law requires, with certain exceptions, the county or city clerk to send
to each active registered voter certain information relating to voting by mail,
including a mail ballot, a return envelope and instructions. (NRS 293.269913,
293C.26312) Sections 4 and 8 of this bill require the return envelope for a mail
ballot to include: (1) a space for the voter to write certain identifying information;
and (2) a QR code or other machine-readable code that directs a voter to the voter
services portal on the Internet website of the Office of the Secretary of State.

Section 11:
Sections 4 and 8 also require the instructions include: (1) an explanation that the
voter must write on the return envelope an identifying number; and (2) the QR code
or other machine-readable code that directs a voter to the voter services portal.
Existing law requires the Secretary of State to prescribe the form of all
envelopes in which mail ballots are sent to voters and return envelopes. (NRS

Section 12:
293.269913, 293C.26312) Sections 4 and 8 require that the design of all envelopes
used by the county or city clerk to send mail ballots to registered voters and return
envelopes must be submitted to and approved by the Secretary of State prior to use
in any election.
Existing law requires: (1) the Secretary of State to establish and maintain a
centralized, top-down database that collects and stores information relating to the
preregistration of persons and the registration of electors from all the counties in
this State; and (2) each county clerk to use the database to collect and maintain all
records of preregistration and registration to vote. Under existing law, the Secretary
of State is required to: (1) use the voter registration information collected in the
database to create the official statewide voter registration list, which serves as the
single method for storing and managing the official list of registered voters in this
State; and (2) enter into a cooperative agreement with the Department of Motor
Vehicles to match information in the database of the statewide voter registration list
with information in the appropriate database of the Department to verify the
accuracy of the information in an application to register to vote. (NRS 293.675)

Section 13:
Section 3 of this bill requires the Department of Motor Vehicles, on a regular
basis, to submit electronically to the Secretary of State certain information relating
to each person who has a driver’s license or identification card issued by the
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 4 –
Department. Section 3 further requires the Secretary of State to: (1) match such
information to registered voters; (2) electronically enter into the centralized, top-
down database such information for each registered voter as soon as practicable
after matching the information to registered voters; (3) identify any person who is a
registered voter and does not possess a driver’s license or identification card; and
(4) indicate in the database whether each registered voter possesses a driver’s
license or identification card issued by the Department. Section 7 of this bill
requires the information submitted to the Secretary of State by the Department to be
included on the statewide voter registration list.
Existing law provides that certain information relating to a registered voter is
confidential and not a public record. (NRS 293.558) Section 6 of this bill provides
that the information submitted to the Secretary of State by the Department pursuant
to section 3 is also confidential and not a public record.
Existing law requires a voter who votes by mail to affix his or her signature in
the space provided on the return envelope of a mail ballot and the county clerk or
city clerk to check the signature to verify the identity of the voter. (NRS

Section 14:
293.269917, 293.269927, 293C.26316, 293C.26327) Sections 4.5 and 8.5 of this
bill require that a voter who votes by mail ballot to also write on the return
envelope: (1) the last four digits of his voter’s driver’s license issued by the
Department of Motor Vehicles; (2) if the voter does not possess a driver’s license
issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles, the last four digits of the voter’s
social security number; or (3) if the voter does not possess a driver’s license issued
by the Department of Motor Vehicles or a social security number, the voter
identification number of the voter.
Existing law provides that if the county clerk or city clerk determines when
checking the signature used for the mail ballot that the voter failed to affix his or
her signature or failed to affix it in the manner required by law or that there is a
reasonable question of fact as to whether the signature used for the mail ballot
matches the signature of the voter, the clerk is required to contact the voter and
advise the voter of the procedures to provide a signature or a confirmation, as
applicable. For the mail ballot to be counted, the voter must provide a signature or a
confirmation, as applicable, not later than 5 p.m. on the sixth day following the
election. (NRS 293.269927, 293C.26327) Sections 5 and 9 of this bill make
various changes to the curing process for mail ballots. First, sections 5 and 9
provide that the clerk is required to check the return envelope to determine whether
the voter included on the return envelope his or her signature and the identifying
number that is required pursuant to section 4.5 or 8.5, as applicable. If the return
envelope does not include a signature and identifying number, the clerk is required
to contact the voter. If the return envelope includes a signature and identifying
number, the clerk is required to check the voter’s signature. If the signature
is verified, the voter is entitled to cast the mail ballot and the identifying number is
not required to be verified. If the voter’s signature cannot be verified, the clerk is
required to check the identifying number included on the return envelope. If the
clerk verifies the identifying number, the voter is entitled to cast the mail ballot. If
the clerk is able to verify neither the signature nor the identifying number, the clerk
is required to contact the voter. Further, sections 5 and 9 require that: (1) with
certain exception, the county clerk and city clerk ensure that employees are
available by telephone until at least 7 p.m. on evenings and weekends during the
curing period; and (2) any voicemail message or hold message used by the office of
the clerk provides instructions on how a voter may provide a signature, an
identifying number or a confirmation. Finally, sections 5 and 9 authorize a voter to
confirm his or her signature or identifying number on the return envelope by
electronic mail or text message.

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law requires, under certain circumstances, a person to provide certain
information to vote in person, which may include depending on the circumstances,
the voter’s signature, proof of residency and identify, answering questions covering
the voter’s personal data or providing additional personal data. (NRS 293.2725,
293.277, 293.285, 293.303, 293.3081, 293.3082, 293.3085, 293.3585, 293.541,
293C.270, 293C.275, 293C.292, 293C.3035, 293C.3585) Section 1.4 of this bill
requires that, in order to vote in person in any election, a registered voter verify his
-

or her identity by presenting certain forms of photo identification. If a registered
voter does not have a form of photo identification, section 1.4 authorizes the
registered voter to cast a provisional ballot. Sections 5.28-5.32 of this bill require
such a voter to provide photo identification not later than 5 p.m. on the Friday
following election day in order for such a provisional ballot to be counted.
Sections 5.14-5.24 and 9.12-9.2 of this bill make conforming changes to the
requirement that voters present photo identification to vote in person, including
eliminating existing requirements for the signatures of voters to be verified for in
person voting.
Sections 5.26 and 9.22 of this bill apply the requirement for voters to show
photo identification to voting at polling places established as vote centers.
Sections 5.34, 5.36, 9.24 and 9.26 of this bill apply the requirement for voters
to show photo identification to the period for early voting.
Section 1.6 of this bill requires the Department of Motor Vehicles to issue an
identification card at no charge to certain registered voters who are experiencing a
financial hardship.
Section 1.8 of this bill requires the Secretary of State to issue a digital
identification card at no charge to a registered voter. Section 9.5 provides that the
Secretary of State is not required to issue such digital identification cards until
January 1, 2028.
Existing law: (1) requires a general election to be held on the first Tuesday after
the first Monday of November in each even-numbered year; and (2) provides that
the period for early voting by personal appearance begins the third Saturday
preceding a general election and extends through the Friday before election day.
(NRS 293.12755, 293.3568) Existing law further requires each county clerk to
establish: (1) a certain number of polling places where a person can vote during the
period for early voting by personal appearance and on the day of the general
election; and (2) a ballot drop box at every polling place in the county, including a
polling place for early voting. (NRS 293.269921, 293.2731, 293.3564) Section 1.84
of this bill: (1) requires each county clerk in certain counties to, for the period
beginning on the day after the last day for early voting by personal appearance and
ending on the day before the day of the general election, establish a certain number
of locations where a voter may return his or her mail ballot in a mail ballot drop
box; and (2) requires such locations to be open for at least 7 hours each day, but not
more than 12 hours each day, during that period. Specifically, in a county whose
population is 700,000 or more (currently only Clark County), a county is required
to establish 10 such locations, and in a county whose population is 100,000 or more
but less than 700,000 (currently only Washoe County), a county clerk is required to
establish 5 such locations. Section 1.84 further authorizes a county clerk in a
county whose population is less than 100,000 (currently all counties other than
Clark and Washoe Counties) to establish any number of such locations and
prescribe the hours for such locations to be open. Each location that is established
by a county clerk pursuant to section 1.84 must be at a polling place that is used for
early voting by personal appearance or a polling place for voting in person on the
day of the election.
Section 4.6 of this bill provides that a mail ballot dropped in a mail ballot drop
box pursuant to section 1.84 counts as a vote in the general election. Section 4.8 of
this bill makes a conforming change to make certain provisions relating to mail
ballots generally applicable to section 1.84.
Existing law requires a ballot drop box to meet certain requirements, including
a requirement for the ballot drop box to be made available for use during the hours
when the office of the county or city clerk or the polling place is open for business
or voting, as applicable. (NRS 293.269921, 293C.26321) Sections 4.6 and 8.7 of
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 3 –
this bill require a ballot drop box to be: (1) monitored at all times during such a
period; and (2) secured during any period of time in which the ballot drop box is
not available for use. Sections 4.6 and 8.7 additionally require the Secretary of
State to adopt regulations to establish requirements for monitoring and securing
ballot drop boxes.
Existing law authorizes, at the request of a voter whose mail ballot has been
prepared by or on behalf of the voter, a person authorized by the voter to return the
mail ballot on behalf of the voter by mail or personal delivery to the county clerk,
or any ballot drop box established in the county by the county clerk. (NRS
293.269923) Section 4.7 of this bill additionally authorizes a person, under such
circumstances, to return a mail ballot on behalf of a voter by returning the mail
ballot to a mail ballot drop box established pursuant to section 1.84.
Section 2 of this bill requires the Secretary of State to establish and maintain a
voter services portal on the Internet website of the Office of the Secretary of State,
which must allow any registered voter in the State to: (1) review his or her voter
registration information; (2) print any form necessary to update his or her voter
registration information; (3) view his or her sample ballot; and (4) obtain the
location of any polling place where the registered voter may vote or deliver a mail
ballot to a ballot drop box. Section 2 further requires the county clerk to include on
any communication to a registered voter a two-dimensional barcode, commonly
known as a QR code, or another machine-readable code used for storing the
Internet address for the voter services portal created by the Secretary of State.
Existing law requires, with certain exceptions, the county or city clerk to send
to each active registered voter certain information relating to voting by mail,
including a mail ballot, a return envelope and instructions. (NRS 293.269913,
293C.26312) Sections 4 and 8 of this bill require the return envelope for a mail
ballot to include: (1) a space for the voter to write certain identifying information;
and (2) a QR code or other machine-readable code that directs a voter to the voter
services portal on the Internet website of the Office of the Secretary of State.
Sections 4 and 8 also require the instructions include: (1) an explanation that the
voter must write on the return envelope an identifying number; and (2) the QR code
or other machine-readable code that directs a voter to the voter services portal.
Existing law requires the Secretary of State to prescribe the form of all
envelopes in which mail ballots are sent to voters and return envelopes. (NRS
293.269913, 293C.26312) Sections 4 and 8 require that the design of all envelopes
used by the county or city clerk to send mail ballots to registered voters and return
envelopes must be submitted to and approved by the Secretary of State prior to use
in any election.
Existing law requires: (1) the Secretary of State to establish and maintain a
centralized, top-down database that collects and stores information relating to the
preregistration of persons and the registration of electors from all the counties in
this State; and (2) each county clerk to use the database to collect and maintain all
records of preregistration and registration to vote. Under existing law, the Secretary
of State is required to: (1) use the voter registration information collected in the
database to create the official statewide voter registration list, which serves as the
single method for storing and managing the official list of registered voters in this
State; and (2) enter into a cooperative agreement with the Department of Motor
Vehicles to match information in the database of the statewide voter registration list
with information in the appropriate database of the Department to verify the
accuracy of the information in an application to register to vote. (NRS 293.675)
Section 3 of this bill requires the Department of Motor Vehicles, on a regular
basis, to submit electronically to the Secretary of State certain information relating
to each person who has a driver’s license or identification card issued by the
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 4 –
Department. Section 3 further requires the Secretary of State to: (1) match such
information to registered voters; (2) electronically enter into the centralized, top-
down database such information for each registered voter as soon as practicable
after matching the information to registered voters; (3) identify any person who is a
registered voter and does not possess a driver’s license or identification card; and
(4) indicate in the database whether each registered voter possesses a driver’s
license or identification card issued by the Department. Section 7 of this bill
requires the information submitted to the Secretary of State by the Department to be
included on the statewide voter registration list.
Existing law provides that certain information relating to a registered voter is
confidential and not a public record. (NRS 293.558) Section 6 of this bill provides
that the information submitted to the Secretary of State by the Department pursuant
to section 3 is also confidential and not a public record.
Existing law requires a voter who votes by mail to affix his or her signature in
the space provided on the return envelope of a mail ballot and the county clerk or
city clerk to check the signature to verify the identity of the voter. (NRS
293.269917, 293.269927, 293C.26316, 293C.26327) Sections 4.5 and 8.5 of this
bill require that a voter who votes by mail ballot to also write on the return
envelope: (1) the last four digits of his voter’s driver’s license issued by the
Department of Motor Vehicles; (2) if the voter does not possess a driver’s license
issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles, the last four digits of the voter’s
social security number; or (3) if the voter does not possess a driver’s license issued
by the Department of Motor Vehicles or a social security number, the voter
identification number of the voter.
Existing law provides that if the county clerk or city clerk determines when
checking the signature used for the mail ballot that the voter failed to affix his or
her signature or failed to affix it in the manner required by law or that there is a
reasonable question of fact as to whether the signature used for the mail ballot
matches the signature of the voter, the clerk is required to contact the voter and
advise the voter of the procedures to provide a signature or a confirmation, as
applicable. For the mail ballot to be counted, the voter must provide a signature or a
confirmation, as applicable, not later than 5 p.m. on the sixth day following the
election. (NRS 293.269927, 293C.26327) Sections 5 and 9 of this bill make
various changes to the curing process for mail ballots. First, sections 5 and 9
provide that the clerk is required to check the return envelope to determine whether
the voter included on the return envelope his or her signature and the identifying
number that is required pursuant to section 4.5 or 8.5, as applicable. If the return
envelope does not include a signature and identifying number, the clerk is required
to contact the voter. If the return envelope includes a signature and identifying
number, the clerk is required to check the voter’s signature. If the signature
is verified, the voter is entitled to cast the mail ballot and the identifying number is
not required to be verified. If the voter’s signature cannot be verified, the clerk is
required to check the identifying number included on the return envelope. If the
clerk verifies the identifying number, the voter is entitled to cast the mail ballot. If
the clerk is able to verify neither the signature nor the identifying number, the clerk
is required to contact the voter. Further, sections 5 and 9 require that: (1) with
certain exception, the county clerk and city clerk ensure that employees are
available by telephone until at least 7 p.m. on evenings and weekends during the
curing period; and (2) any voicemail message or hold message used by the office of
the clerk provides instructions on how a voter may provide a signature, an
identifying number or a confirmation. Finally, sections 5 and 9 authorize a voter to
confirm his or her signature or identifying number on the return envelope by
electronic mail or text message.
