AN ACT relating to elections; requiring each county clerk to establish and maintain
a voter services portal on the Internet website of the office of the
county clerk; requiring the county clerk to include certain
information relating to the voter services portal on any
communication to a registered voter; requiring the Department of
Motor Vehicles to submit electronically to each county clerk certain

to include certain information received from the Department in the
centralized, top-down database that is established by the Secretary of
State for purposes of creating the statewide voter registration list;
requiring certain information to be included on the return envelope for
a mail ballot; revising provisions relating to signature curing for mail
ballots; providing that certain information on the statewide voter
registration list relating to a voter is confidential and not a public
record; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Section 2 of this bill requires each county clerk to establish and maintain a voter services
2 portal on the Internet website of the office of the county clerk, which must allow any
3 registered voter in the county to: (1) review his or her voter registration information; (2) print
4 any form necessary to update his or her voter registration information; (3) view his or her
5 sample ballot; and (4) obtain the location of any polling place where the registered voter may
6 vote or deliver a mail ballot to a ballot drop box. Section 2 further : (1) authorizes a county
7 clerk to request the assistance of the Secretary of State to establish and maintain the voter
8 services portal [.] ; and (2) requires the county clerk to include on any communication to
9 a registered voter a two-dimensional barcode, commonly known as a QR code, or
10 another machine-readable code used for storing the Internet address for the voter
11 services portal created by the county clerk pursuant to section 2.
12 Existing law requires, with certain exceptions, the county or city clerk to send to each
13 active registered voter certain information relating to voting by mail, including a mail ballot
Assembly Amendment No. 386 to Assembly Bill No. 499 Page 4
14 and a return envelope. (NRS 293.269913, 293C.26312) Sections 4 and 8 of this bill require
15 the return envelope for a mail ballot to include: (1) a space for the voter to voluntarily write
16 certain identifying information; and (2) a QR code or other machine-readable code that directs
17 a voter to the voter services portal on the Internet website of the office of the county clerk.
18 Existing law requires: (1) the Secretary of State to establish and maintain a centralized,
19 top-down database that collects and stores information relating to the preregistration of
20 persons and the registration of electors from all the counties in this State; and (2) each county
21 clerk to use the database to collect and maintain all records of preregistration and registration
22 to vote. Under existing law, the Secretary of State is required to: (1) use the voter registration
23 information collected in the database to create the official statewide voter registration list,
24 which serves as the single method for storing and managing the official list of registered
25 voters in this State; and (2) enter into a cooperative agreement with the Department of Motor
26 Vehicles to match information in the database of the statewide voter registration list with
27 information in the appropriate database of the Department to verify the accuracy of the
28 information in an application to register to vote. (NRS 293.675)
29 Section 3 of this bill requires the Department of Motor Vehicles, on a regular basis, to
30 submit electronically to each county clerk certain information relating to each person who has
31 a driver’s license or identification card issued by the Department. Section 3 further requires
32 the county clerk to: (1) match such information to registered voters in the county; (2)
33 electronically enter into the centralized, top-down database such information for each
34 registered voter in the county as soon as practicable after matching the information to
35 registered voters in the county; (3) identify any person who is a registered voter in the county
36 and does not have a driver’s license or identification card; and (4) indicate in the database
37 whether each registered voter in the county has a driver’s license or identification card issued
38 by the Department. Section 7 of this bill requires the information submitted to the county
39 clerk by the Department to be included on the statewide voter registration list.
40 Existing law provides that certain information relating to a registered voter is confidential
41 and not a public record. (NRS 293.558) Section 6 of this bill provides that the information
42 submitted to the county clerk by the Department pursuant to section 3 is also confidential and
43 not a public record.
44 Existing law requires a voter who votes by mail to affix his or her signature in the space
45 provided on the return envelope of a mail ballot and the county clerk or city clerk to check the
46 signature to verify the identity of the voter. (NRS 293.269917, 293.269927, 293C.26316,
47 293C.26327) Existing law provides that if the county clerk or city clerk determines when
48 checking the signature used for the mail ballot that the voter failed to affix his or her signature
49 or failed to affix it in the manner required by law or that there is a reasonable question of fact
50 as to whether the signature used for the mail ballot matches the signature of the voter, the
51 clerk is required to contact the voter and advise the voter of the procedures to provide a
52 signature or a confirmation, as applicable. For the mail ballot to be counted, the voter must
53 provide a signature or a confirmation, as applicable, not later than 5 p.m. on the sixth day
54 following the election. (NRS 293.269927, 293C.26327) Sections 5 and 9 of this bill make
55 various changes to the signature curing process. First, sections 5 and 9 provide that if the
56 voter included on the return envelope the last four digits of the voter’s driver’s license, the last
57 four digits of the voter’s social security number or the voter’s voter identification number and
58 such information is confirmed by the clerk to be accurate, the voter is entitled to cast the ballot
59 and the signature is not required to be verified. If the voter did not include such information
60 on the return envelope or the information provided on the return envelope is not accurate, the
61 clerk or an employee in the office of the clerk is required to check the signature. Second,
62 sections 5 and 9 require that: (1) the county clerk and city clerk ensure that employees are
63 available by telephone until at least 7 p.m. on evenings and weekends during the signature
64 curing period; and (2) any voicemail message or hold message used by the office of the clerk
65 provides instructions on how a voter may provide a signature or a signature confirmation.
66 Finally, sections 5 and 9 authorize a voter to confirm his or her signature on the return
67 envelope by electronic mail or text message.

1 Sec. 5. NRS 293.269927 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 293.269927 1. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 293D.200, when a
3 mail ballot is returned by or on behalf of a voter to the county clerk, and a record of
4 its return is made in the mail ballot record for the election, the clerk or an employee
5 in the office of the clerk shall check the return envelope to determine whether the
6 voter included on the return envelope the last four digits of the voter’s driver’s
7 license, the last four digits of the voter’s social security number or the voter’s
8 voter identification number. If the return envelope includes any such information
9 and such information is confirmed by the clerk to be accurate, the voter is
10 entitled to cast the mail ballot and the signature is not required to be checked. If
11 the voter did not include such information on the return envelope or the
12 information provided on the return envelope is not accurate, the clerk or an
13 employee in the office of the clerk must check the signature used for the mail
14 ballot by electronic means pursuant to subsection 2 or manually pursuant to
15 subsection 3.
16 2. To check the signature used for a mail ballot by electronic means:
17 (a) The electronic device must take a digital image of the signature used for the

19 or her application to register to vote or application to preregister to vote available in
20 the records of the county clerk.
21 (b) If the electronic device does not match the signature of the voter, the
22 signature shall be reviewed manually pursuant to the provisions of subsection 3.
23 3. To check the signature used for a mail ballot manually, the county clerk
24 shall use the following procedure:
25 (a) The clerk or employee shall check the signature used for the mail ballot
26 against all signatures of the voter available in the records of the clerk.
27 (b) If at least two employees in the office of the clerk believe there is a
28 reasonable question of fact as to whether the signature used for the mail ballot
29 matches the signature of the voter, the clerk shall contact the voter and ask the voter
30 to confirm whether the signature used for the mail ballot belongs to the voter.
31 4. For purposes of subsection 3:
32 (a) There is a reasonable question of fact as to whether the signature used for
33 the mail ballot matches the signature of the voter if the signature used for the mail
34 ballot differs in multiple, significant and obvious respects from the signatures of the
35 voter available in the records of the clerk.
36 (b) There is not a reasonable question of fact as to whether the signature used
37 for the mail ballot matches the signature of the voter if:
38 (1) The signature used for the mail ballot is a variation of the signature of
39 the voter caused by the substitution of initials for the first or middle name, the
40 substitution of a different type of punctuation in the first, middle or last name, the
41 use of a common nickname or the use of one last name for a person who has two
42 last names and it does not otherwise differ in multiple, significant and obvious
43 respects from the signatures of the voter available in the records of the clerk; or
44 (2) There are only slight dissimilarities between the signature used for the
45 mail ballot and the signatures of the voter available in the records of the clerk.
46 5. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 6, if the clerk determines that
47 the voter is entitled to cast the mail ballot, the clerk shall deposit the mail ballot in
48 the proper ballot box or place the mail ballot, unopened, in a container that must be
49 securely locked or under the control of the clerk at all times. The clerk shall deliver
50 the mail ballots to the mail ballot central counting board to be processed and
51 prepared for counting.
52 6. If the clerk determines when checking the signature used for the mail ballot
53 that the voter failed to affix his or her signature or failed to affix it in the manner
Assembly Amendment No. 386 to Assembly Bill No. 499 Page 8
1 required by law for the mail ballot or that there is a reasonable question of fact as to
2 whether the signature used for the mail ballot matches the signature of the voter,
3 but the voter is otherwise entitled to cast the mail ballot, the clerk shall contact the
4 voter and advise the voter of the procedures to provide a signature or a confirmation
5 that the signature used for the mail ballot belongs to the voter, as applicable. For the
6 mail ballot to be counted, the voter must provide a signature or a confirmation, as
7 applicable, not later than 5 p.m. on the sixth day following the election. During the
8 period in which signatures may be cured, the clerk shall ensure that employees in
9 the office of the clerk are available by telephone until at least 7 p.m. on evenings
10 and weekends. Any voicemail message or hold message used by the office of the
11 clerk must provide instructions on how a voter may provide a signature or a
12 confirmation.
13 7. The clerk shall prescribe procedures for a voter who failed to affix his or
14 her signature or failed to affix it in the manner required by law for the mail ballot,
15 or for whom there is a reasonable question of fact as to whether the signature used
16 for the mail ballot matches the signature of the voter, in order to:
17 (a) Contact the voter;
18 (b) Allow the voter to provide a signature or a confirmation that the signature
19 used for the mail ballot belongs to the voter, as applicable; and
20 (c) After a signature or a confirmation is provided, as applicable, ensure the
21 mail ballot is delivered to the mail ballot central counting board.
22 8. If there is a reasonable question of fact as to whether the signature used for
23 the mail ballot matches the signature of the voter, the voter must be identified by:
24 (a) Answering questions from the county clerk covering the personal data
25 which is reported on the application to register to vote;
26 (b) Providing the county clerk, orally or in writing, including, without
27 limitation, in writing by electronic mail or text message, with other personal data
28 which verifies the identity of the voter; or
29 (c) Providing the county clerk with proof of identification as described in NRS
30 293.277 other than the voter registration card issued to the voter.
31 9. The procedures established pursuant to subsection 7 for contacting a voter
32 must require the clerk to contact the voter, as soon as possible after receipt of the
33 mail ballot, by:
34 (a) Mail;
35 (b) Telephone, if a telephone number for the voter is available in the records of
36 the clerk; and
37 (c) Electronic means, which [may] must include, without limitation [,
38 electronic] :
39 (1) Electronic mail, if the voter has provided the clerk with [sufficient
40 information to contact the voter by such means.] an electronic mail address; or
41 (2) Text message, if the voter has provided the clerk with a cellular
42 telephone number.
43 Sec. 6. NRS 293.558 is hereby amended to read as follows:

46 maintain the statewide voter registration list. The Secretary of State must compare
47 the records of the State Registrar of Vital Statistics to those in the statewide voter
48 registration list at least once per month.
49 9. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 481.063 or any provision of law

8 which is requested and which the Secretary of State deems necessary for the chief
9 officer of elections of that state to maintain a voter registration list, if the Secretary
10 of State is satisfied that the information provided pursuant to this paragraph will be
11 used only for the maintenance of that voter registration list.

23 (III) The voter identification number of the voter; and
24 (2) A two-dimensional barcode, commonly known as a QR code, or
25 another machine-readable code used for storing the Internet address for the voter
26 services portal created by the county clerk pursuant to section 2 of this act;
27 (c) An envelope or sleeve into which the mail ballot is inserted to ensure its
28 secrecy; and
29 (d) Instructions [.] that include, without limitation:
30 (1) An explanation that the voter may voluntarily write on the return
31 envelope the information described in paragraph (b); and
32 (2) A two-dimensional barcode, commonly known as a QR code, or
33 another machine-readable code used for storing the Internet address for the voter
34 services portal on the Internet website of the county clerk.
35 2. In sending a mail ballot to an active registered voter, the city clerk shall use
36 an envelope that may not be forwarded to an address of the voter that is different
37 from the address to which the mail ballot is mailed.
38 3. The return envelope must include postage prepaid by first-class mail if the
39 active registered voter is within the boundaries of the United States, its territories or
40 possessions or on a military base.
41 4. Before sending a mail ballot to an active registered voter, the city clerk
42 shall record:
43 (a) The date the mail ballot is issued;
44 (b) The name of the voter to whom the mail ballot is issued, his or her precinct
45 or district and his or her political affiliation, if any, unless all the offices on the mail
46 ballot are nonpartisan offices;
47 (c) The number of the mail ballot; and
48 (d) Any remarks the city clerk finds appropriate.

Assembly Amendment No. 386 to Assembly Bill No. 499 Page 12
1 (b) A method for distinguishing the return envelopes of each city which must
2 be prominently displayed on the outside of the return envelope.
3 Sec. 9. NRS 293C.26327 is hereby amended to read as follows:
4 293C.26327 1. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 293D.200, when a
5 mail ballot is returned by or on behalf of a voter to the city clerk, and a record of its
6 return is made in the mail ballot record for the election, the clerk or an employee in
7 the office of the clerk shall check the return envelope to determine whether the
8 voter included on the return envelope the last four digits of the voter’s driver’s
9 license, the last four digits of the voter’s social security number or the voter’s
10 voter identification number. If the return envelope includes any such information
11 and such information is confirmed by the clerk to be accurate, the voter is
12 entitled to cast the mail ballot and the signature is not required to be checked. If
13 the voter did not include such information on the return envelope or the
14 information provided on the return envelope is not accurate, the clerk or an
15 employee in the office of the clerk must check the signature used for the mail
16 ballot by electronic means pursuant to subsection 2 or manually pursuant to
17 subsection 3.
18 2. To check the signature used for a mail ballot by electronic means:
19 (a) The electronic device must take a digital image of the signature used for the
20 mail ballot and electronically compare the digital image with the signatures of the
21 voter from his or her application to register to vote or application to preregister to
22 vote available in the records of the city clerk.
23 (b) If the electronic device does not match the signature of the voter, the
24 signature shall be reviewed manually pursuant to the provisions of subsection 3.
25 3. To check the signature used for a mail ballot manually, the city clerk shall
26 use the following procedure:
27 (a) The clerk or employee shall check the signature used for the mail ballot
28 against all signatures of the voter available in the records of the clerk.
29 (b) If at least two employees in the office of the clerk believe there is a
30 reasonable question of fact as to whether the signature used for the mail ballot
31 matches the signature of the voter, the clerk shall contact the voter and ask the voter
32 to confirm whether the signature used for the mail ballot belongs to the voter.
33 4. For purposes of subsection 3:
34 (a) There is a reasonable question of fact as to whether the signature used for
35 the mail ballot matches the signature of the voter if the signature used for the mail
36 ballot differs in multiple, significant and obvious respects from the signatures of the
37 voter available in the records of the clerk.
38 (b) There is not a reasonable question of fact as to whether the signature used
39 for the mail ballot matches the signature of the voter if:
40 (1) The signature used for the mail ballot is a variation of the signature of
41 the voter caused by the substitution of initials for the first or middle name, the
42 substitution of a different type of punctuation in the first, middle or last name, the
43 use of a common nickname or the use of one last name for a person who has two
44 last names and it does not otherwise differ in multiple, significant and obvious
45 respects from the signatures of the voter available in the records of the clerk; or
46 (2) There are only slight dissimilarities between the signature used for the
47 mail ballot and the signatures of the voter available in the records of the clerk.
48 5. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 6, if the clerk determines that
49 the voter is entitled to cast the mail ballot, the clerk shall deposit the mail ballot in
50 the proper ballot box or place the mail ballot, unopened, in a container that must be
51 securely locked or under the control of the clerk at all times. The clerk shall deliver
52 the mail ballots to the mail ballot central counting board to be processed and
53 prepared for counting.
Assembly Amendment No. 386 to Assembly Bill No. 499 Page 13
1 6. If the clerk determines when checking the signature used for the mail ballot
2 that the voter failed to affix his or her signature or failed to affix it in the manner
3 required by law for the mail ballot or that there is a reasonable question of fact as to
4 whether the signature used for the mail ballot matches the signature of the voter,
5 but the voter is otherwise entitled to cast the mail ballot, the clerk shall contact the
6 voter and advise the voter of the procedures to provide a signature or a confirmation
7 that the signature used for the mail ballot belongs to the voter, as applicable. For the
8 mail ballot to be counted, the voter must provide a signature or a confirmation, as
9 applicable, not later than 5 p.m. on the sixth day following the election. During the
10 period in which signatures may be cured, the clerk shall ensure that employees in
11 the office of the clerk are available by telephone until at least 7 p.m. on evenings
12 and weekends. Any voicemail message or hold message used by the office of the
13 clerk must provide instructions on how a voter may provide a signature or a
14 confirmation.
15 7. The clerk shall prescribe procedures for a voter who failed to affix his or
16 her signature or failed to affix it in the manner required by law for the mail ballot,
17 or for whom there is a reasonable question of fact as to whether the signature used
18 for the mail ballot matches the signature of the voter, in order to:
19 (a) Contact the voter;
20 (b) Allow the voter to provide a signature or a confirmation that the signature
21 used for the mail ballot belongs to the voter, as applicable; and
22 (c) After a signature or a confirmation is provided, as applicable, ensure the
23 mail ballot is delivered to the mail ballot central counting board.
24 8. If there is a reasonable question of fact as to whether the signature used for
25 the mail ballot matches the signature of the voter, the voter must be identified by:
26 (a) Answering questions from the city clerk covering the personal data which is
27 reported on the application to register to vote;
28 (b) Providing the city clerk, orally or in writing, including, without limitation,
29 in writing by electronic mail or text message, with other personal data which
30 verifies the identity of the voter; or
31 (c) Providing the city clerk with proof of identification as described in NRS
32 293C.270 other than the voter registration card issued to the voter.
33 9. The procedures established pursuant to subsection 7 for contacting a voter
34 must require the clerk to contact the voter, as soon as possible after receipt of the
35 mail ballot, by:
36 (a) Mail;
37 (b) Telephone, if a telephone number for the voter is available in the records of
38 the clerk; and
39 (c) Electronic means, which [may] must include, without limitation [,
40 electronic] :
41 (1) Electronic mail, if the voter has provided the clerk with [sufficient
42 information to contact the voter by such means.] an electronic mail address; and
43 (2) Text message, if the voter has provided the clerk with a cellular
44 telephone number.
45 Sec. 10. The provisions of NRS 354.599 do not apply to any additional
46 expenses of a local government that are related to the provisions of this act.
47 Sec. 11. 1. This section and section 10 of this act become effective upon
48 passage and approval.
49 2. Sections 1 to 9, inclusive, of this act become effective:

51 performing any other preparatory administrative tasks that are necessary to carry
52 out the provisions of this act; and
53 (b) On October 1, 2025, for all other purposes.

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to elections; requiring each county clerk to establish and maintain
a voter services portal on the Internet website of the office of the
county clerk; requiring the county clerk to include certain
information relating to the voter services portal on any
communication to a registered voter; requiring the Department of
Motor Vehicles to submit electronically to each county clerk certain
information relating to each person who has a driver’s license or
identification card issued by the Department; requiring the county clerk
to include certain information received from the Department in the
centralized, top-down database that is established by the Secretary of
State for purposes of creating the statewide voter registration list;
requiring certain information to be included on the return envelope for
a mail ballot; revising provisions relating to signature curing for mail
ballots; providing that certain information on the statewide voter
registration list relating to a voter is confidential and not a public
record; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Section 2 of this bill requires each county clerk to establish and maintain a voter services
2 portal on the Internet website of the office of the county clerk, which must allow any
3 registered voter in the county to: (1) review his or her voter registration information; (2) print
4 any form necessary to update his or her voter registration information; (3) view his or her
5 sample ballot; and (4) obtain the location of any polling place where the registered voter may
6 vote or deliver a mail ballot to a ballot drop box. Section 2 further : (1) authorizes a county
7 clerk to request the assistance of the Secretary of State to establish and maintain the voter
8 services portal [.] ; and (2) requires the county clerk to include on any communication to
9 a registered voter a two-dimensional barcode, commonly known as a QR code, or
10 another machine-readable code used for storing the Internet address for the voter
11 services portal created by the county clerk pursuant to section 2.
12 Existing law requires, with certain exceptions, the county or city clerk to send to each
13 active registered voter certain information relating to voting by mail, including a mail ballot

Assembly Amendment No. 386 to Assembly Bill No. 499 Page 4
14 and a return envelope. (NRS 293.269913, 293C.26312) Sections 4 and 8 of this bill require
15 the return envelope for a mail ballot to include: (1) a space for the voter to voluntarily write
16 certain identifying information; and (2) a QR code or other machine-readable code that directs
17 a voter to the voter services portal on the Internet website of the office of the county clerk.
18 Existing law requires: (1) the Secretary of State to establish and maintain a centralized,
19 top-down database that collects and stores information relating to the preregistration of
20 persons and the registration of electors from all the counties in this State; and (2) each county
21 clerk to use the database to collect and maintain all records of preregistration and registration
22 to vote. Under existing law, the Secretary of State is required to: (1) use the voter registration
23 information collected in the database to create the official statewide voter registration list,
24 which serves as the single method for storing and managing the official list of registered
25 voters in this State; and (2) enter into a cooperative agreement with the Department of Motor
26 Vehicles to match information in the database of the statewide voter registration list with
27 information in the appropriate database of the Department to verify the accuracy of the
28 information in an application to register to vote. (NRS 293.675)
29 Section 3 of this bill requires the Department of Motor Vehicles, on a regular basis, to
30 submit electronically to each county clerk certain information relating to each person who has
31 a driver’s license or identification card issued by the Department. Section 3 further requires
32 the county clerk to: (1) match such information to registered voters in the county; (2)
33 electronically enter into the centralized, top-down database such information for each
34 registered voter in the county as soon as practicable after matching the information to
35 registered voters in the county; (3) identify any person who is a registered voter in the county
36 and does not have a driver’s license or identification card; and (4) indicate in the database
37 whether each registered voter in the county has a driver’s license or identification card issued
38 by the Department. Section 7 of this bill requires the information submitted to the county
39 clerk by the Department to be included on the statewide voter registration list.
40 Existing law provides that certain information relating to a registered voter is confidential
41 and not a public record. (NRS 293.558) Section 6 of this bill provides that the information
42 submitted to the county clerk by the Department pursuant to section 3 is also confidential and
43 not a public record.
44 Existing law requires a voter who votes by mail to affix his or her signature in the space
45 provided on the return envelope of a mail ballot and the county clerk or city clerk to check the
46 signature to verify the identity of the voter. (NRS 293.269917, 293.269927, 293C.26316,
47 293C.26327) Existing law provides that if the county clerk or city clerk determines when
48 checking the signature used for the mail ballot that the voter failed to affix his or her signature
49 or failed to affix it in the manner required by law or that there is a reasonable question of fact
50 as to whether the signature used for the mail ballot matches the signature of the voter, the
51 clerk is required to contact the voter and advise the voter of the procedures to provide a
52 signature or a confirmation, as applicable. For the mail ballot to be counted, the voter must
53 provide a signature or a confirmation, as applicable, not later than 5 p.m. on the sixth day
54 following the election. (NRS 293.269927, 293C.26327) Sections 5 and 9 of this bill make
55 various changes to the signature curing process. First, sections 5 and 9 provide that if the
56 voter included on the return envelope the last four digits of the voter’s driver’s license, the last
57 four digits of the voter’s social security number or the voter’s voter identification number and
58 such information is confirmed by the clerk to be accurate, the voter is entitled to cast the ballot
59 and the signature is not required to be verified. If the voter did not include such information
60 on the return envelope or the information provided on the return envelope is not accurate, the
61 clerk or an employee in the office of the clerk is required to check the signature. Second,
62 sections 5 and 9 require that: (1) the county clerk and city clerk ensure that employees are
63 available by telephone until at least 7 p.m. on evenings and weekends during the signature
64 curing period; and (2) any voicemail message or hold message used by the office of the clerk
65 provides instructions on how a voter may provide a signature or a signature confirmation.
66 Finally, sections 5 and 9 authorize a voter to confirm his or her signature on the return
67 envelope by electronic mail or text message.

1 required by law for the mail ballot or that there is a reasonable question of fact as to
2 whether the signature used for the mail ballot matches the signature of the voter,
3 but the voter is otherwise entitled to cast the mail ballot, the clerk shall contact the
4 voter and advise the voter of the procedures to provide a signature or a confirmation
