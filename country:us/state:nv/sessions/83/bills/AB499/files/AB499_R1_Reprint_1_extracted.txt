Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Section 2 of this bill requires each county clerk to establish and maintain a
2 voter services portal on the Internet website of the office of the county clerk, which
3 must allow any registered voter in the county to: (1) review his or her voter
-
*AB499_R1*
– 2 –
4 registration information; (2) print any form necessary to update his or her voter
5 registration information; (3) view his or her sample ballot; and (4) obtain the
6 location of any polling place where the registered voter may vote or deliver a mail
7 ballot to a ballot drop box. Section 2 further: (1) authorizes a county clerk to
8 request the assistance of the Secretary of State to establish and maintain the voter
9 services portal; and (2) requires the county clerk to include on any communication
10 to a registered voter a two-dimensional barcode, commonly known as a QR code,
11 or another machine-readable code used for storing the Internet address for the voter
12 services portal created by the county clerk pursuant to section 2.
13 Existing law requires, with certain exceptions, the county or city clerk to send
14 to each active registered voter certain information relating to voting by mail,
15 including a mail ballot and a return envelope. (NRS 293.269913, 293C.26312)
16 Sections 4 and 8 of this bill require the return envelope for a mail ballot to include:
17 (1) a space for the voter to voluntarily write certain identifying information; and (2)
18 a QR code or other machine-readable code that directs a voter to the voter services
19 portal on the Internet website of the office of the county clerk.
20 Existing law requires: (1) the Secretary of State to establish and maintain a
21 centralized, top-down database that collects and stores information relating to the
22 preregistration of persons and the registration of electors from all the counties in
23 this State; and (2) each county clerk to use the database to collect and maintain all
24 records of preregistration and registration to vote. Under existing law, the Secretary
25 of State is required to: (1) use the voter registration information collected in the
26 database to create the official statewide voter registration list, which serves as the
27 single method for storing and managing the official list of registered voters in this
28 State; and (2) enter into a cooperative agreement with the Department of Motor
29 Vehicles to match information in the database of the statewide voter registration list
30 with information in the appropriate database of the Department to verify the
31 accuracy of the information in an application to register to vote. (NRS 293.675)
32 Section 3 of this bill requires the Department of Motor Vehicles, on a regular
33 basis, to submit electronically to each county clerk certain information relating to
34 each person who has a driver’s license or identification card issued by the
35 Department. Section 3 further requires the county clerk to: (1) match such
36 information to registered voters in the county; (2) electronically enter into the
37 centralized, top-down database such information for each registered voter in the
38 county as soon as practicable after matching the information to registered voters in
39 the county; (3) identify any person who is a registered voter in the county and does
40 not have a driver’s license or identification card; and (4) indicate in the database
41 whether each registered voter in the county has a driver’s license or identification
42 card issued by the Department. Section 7 of this bill requires the information
43 submitted to the county clerk by the Department to be included on the statewide
44 voter registration list.
45 Existing law provides that certain information relating to a registered voter is
46 confidential and not a public record. (NRS 293.558) Section 6 of this bill provides
47 that the information submitted to the county clerk by the Department pursuant to
48 section 3 is also confidential and not a public record.
49 Existing law requires a voter who votes by mail to affix his or her signature in
50 the space provided on the return envelope of a mail ballot and the county clerk or
51 city clerk to check the signature to verify the identity of the voter. (NRS
52 293.269917, 293.269927, 293C.26316, 293C.26327) Existing law provides that if
53 the county clerk or city clerk determines when checking the signature used for the
54 mail ballot that the voter failed to affix his or her signature or failed to affix it in the
55 manner required by law or that there is a reasonable question of fact as to whether
56 the signature used for the mail ballot matches the signature of the voter, the clerk is
57 required to contact the voter and advise the voter of the procedures to provide a
58 signature or a confirmation, as applicable. For the mail ballot to be counted, the
-
*AB499_R1*
– 3 –
59 voter must provide a signature or a confirmation, as applicable, not later than 5 p.m.
60 on the sixth day following the election. (NRS 293.269927, 293C.26327) Sections 5
61 and 9 of this bill make various changes to the signature curing process. First,
62 sections 5 and 9 provide that if the voter included on the return envelope the last
63 four digits of the voter’s driver’s license, the last four digits of the voter’s social
64 security number or the voter’s voter identification number and such information is
65 confirmed by the clerk to be accurate, the voter is entitled to cast the ballot and the
66 signature is not required to be verified. If the voter did not include such information
67 on the return envelope or the information provided on the return envelope is not
68 accurate, the clerk or an employee in the office of the clerk is required to check the
69 signature. Second, sections 5 and 9 require that: (1) the county clerk and city clerk
70 ensure that employees are available by telephone until at least 7 p.m. on evenings
71 and weekends during the signature curing period; and (2) any voicemail message or
72 hold message used by the office of the clerk provides instructions on how a voter
73 may provide a signature or a signature confirmation. Finally, sections 5 and 9
74 authorize a voter to confirm his or her signature on the return envelope by
75 electronic mail or text message.

13 entitled to cast the mail ballot and the signature is not required to
14 be checked. If the voter did not include such information on the

31 county clerk shall use the following procedure:
32 (a) The clerk or employee shall check the signature used for the
33 mail ballot against all signatures of the voter available in the records
34 of the clerk.
35 (b) If at least two employees in the office of the clerk believe
36 there is a reasonable question of fact as to whether the signature
37 used for the mail ballot matches the signature of the voter, the clerk
38 shall contact the voter and ask the voter to confirm whether the
39 signature used for the mail ballot belongs to the voter.
40 4. For purposes of subsection 3:
41 (a) There is a reasonable question of fact as to whether the

11 records of the clerk; or
12 (2) There are only slight dissimilarities between the signature
13 used for the mail ballot and the signatures of the voter available in
14 the records of the clerk.
15 5. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 6, if the clerk
16 determines that the voter is entitled to cast the mail ballot, the clerk
17 shall deposit the mail ballot in the proper ballot box or place the
18 mail ballot, unopened, in a container that must be securely locked or
19 under the control of the clerk at all times. The clerk shall deliver the
20 mail ballots to the mail ballot central counting board to be processed
21 and prepared for counting.
22 6. If the clerk determines when checking the signature used for
23 the mail ballot that the voter failed to affix his or her signature or
24 failed to affix it in the manner required by law for the mail ballot or
25 that there is a reasonable question of fact as to whether the signature
26 used for the mail ballot matches the signature of the voter, but the
27 voter is otherwise entitled to cast the mail ballot, the clerk shall

22 the statewide voter registration list. The Secretary of State must
23 compare the records of the State Registrar of Vital Statistics to those
24 in the statewide voter registration list at least once per month.
25 9. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 481.063 or any
26 provision of law providing for the confidentiality of information, the

38 deems necessary for the chief officer of elections of that state to
39 maintain a voter registration list, if the Secretary of State is satisfied
40 that the information provided pursuant to this paragraph will be used
41 only for the maintenance of that voter registration list.

12 (2) A two-dimensional barcode, commonly known as a QR
13 code, or another machine-readable code used for storing the
14 Internet address for the voter services portal created by the county
15 clerk pursuant to section 2 of this act;
16 (c) An envelope or sleeve into which the mail ballot is inserted
17 to ensure its secrecy; and
18 (d) Instructions [.] that include, without limitation:
19 (1) An explanation that the voter may voluntarily write on
20 the return envelope the information described in paragraph (b);
21 and
22 (2) A two-dimensional barcode, commonly known as a QR
23 code, or another machine-readable code used for storing the
24 Internet address for the voter services portal on the Internet
25 website of the county clerk.

28 of the voter that is different from the address to which the mail
29 ballot is mailed.
30 3. The return envelope must include postage prepaid by first-
31 class mail if the active registered voter is within the boundaries of

1 (b) A method for distinguishing the return envelopes of each
2 city which must be prominently displayed on the outside of the

4 Sec. 9. NRS 293C.26327 is hereby amended to read as
5 follows:
6 293C.26327 1. Except as otherwise provided in NRS
7 293D.200, when a mail ballot is returned by or on behalf of a voter
8 to the city clerk, and a record of its return is made in the mail ballot
9 record for the election, the clerk or an employee in the office of the
10 clerk shall check the return envelope to determine whether the
11 voter included on the return envelope the last four digits of
12 the voter’s driver’s license, the last four digits of the voter’s social
13 security number or the voter’s voter identification number. If the
14 return envelope includes any such information and such
15 information is confirmed by the clerk to be accurate, the voter is
16 entitled to cast the mail ballot and the signature is not required to
17 be checked. If the voter did not include such information on the
18 return envelope or the information provided on the return
19 envelope is not accurate, the clerk or an employee in the office of
20 the clerk must check the signature used for the mail ballot by
21 electronic means pursuant to subsection 2 or manually pursuant to
22 subsection 3.
23 2. To check the signature used for a mail ballot by electronic
24 means:
25 (a) The electronic device must take a digital image of the
26 signature used for the mail ballot and electronically compare the
27 digital image with the signatures of the voter from his or her
28 application to register to vote or application to preregister to vote
29 available in the records of the city clerk.
30 (b) If the electronic device does not match the signature of the
31 voter, the signature shall be reviewed manually pursuant to the
32 provisions of subsection 3.
33 3. To check the signature used for a mail ballot manually, the
34 city clerk shall use the following procedure:
35 (a) The clerk or employee shall check the signature used for the
36 mail ballot against all signatures of the voter available in the records
37 of the clerk.
38 (b) If at least two employees in the office of the clerk believe
39 there is a reasonable question of fact as to whether the signature
40 used for the mail ballot matches the signature of the voter, the clerk
41 shall contact the voter and ask the voter to confirm whether the
42 signature used for the mail ballot belongs to the voter.
43 4. For purposes of subsection 3:
44 (a) There is a reasonable question of fact as to whether the
45 signature used for the mail ballot matches the signature of the voter
-
*AB499_R1*
– 14 –
1 if the signature used for the mail ballot differs in multiple,
2 significant and obvious respects from the signatures of the voter
3 available in the records of the clerk.
4 (b) There is not a reasonable question of fact as to whether the
5 signature used for the mail ballot matches the signature of the voter
6 if:
7 (1) The signature used for the mail ballot is a variation of the
8 signature of the voter caused by the substitution of initials for the
9 first or middle name, the substitution of a different type of
10 punctuation in the first, middle or last name, the use of a common
11 nickname or the use of one last name for a person who has two last
12 names and it does not otherwise differ in multiple, significant and
13 obvious respects from the signatures of the voter available in the
14 records of the clerk; or
15 (2) There are only slight dissimilarities between the signature
16 used for the mail ballot and the signatures of the voter available in
17 the records of the clerk.
18 5. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 6, if the clerk
19 determines that the voter is entitled to cast the mail ballot, the clerk
20 shall deposit the mail ballot in the proper ballot box or place the
21 mail ballot, unopened, in a container that must be securely locked or
22 under the control of the clerk at all times. The clerk shall deliver the
23 mail ballots to the mail ballot central counting board to be processed
24 and prepared for counting.
25 6. If the clerk determines when checking the signature used for
26 the mail ballot that the voter failed to affix his or her signature or
27 failed to affix it in the manner required by law for the mail ballot or
28 that there is a reasonable question of fact as to whether the signature
29 used for the mail ballot matches the signature of the voter, but the
30 voter is otherwise entitled to cast the mail ballot, the clerk shall
31 contact the voter and advise the voter of the procedures to provide a
32 signature or a confirmation that the signature used for the mail ballot
33 belongs to the voter, as applicable. For the mail ballot to be counted,
34 the voter must provide a signature or a confirmation, as applicable,
35 not later than 5 p.m. on the sixth day following the election. During
36 the period in which signatures may be cured, the clerk shall
37 ensure that employees in the office of the clerk are available by
38 telephone until at least 7 p.m. on evenings and weekends. Any
39 voicemail message or hold message used by the office of the clerk
40 must provide instructions on how a voter may provide a signature
41 or a confirmation.
42 7. The clerk shall prescribe procedures for a voter who failed to
43 affix his or her signature or failed to affix it in the manner required
44 by law for the mail ballot, or for whom there is a reasonable
-
*AB499_R1*
– 15 –
1 question of fact as to whether the signature used for the mail ballot
2 matches the signature of the voter, in order to:
3 (a) Contact the voter;
4 (b) Allow the voter to provide a signature or a confirmation that
5 the signature used for the mail ballot belongs to the voter, as
6 applicable; and
7 (c) After a signature or a confirmation is provided, as applicable,
8 ensure the mail ballot is delivered to the mail ballot central counting
9 board.
10 8. If there is a reasonable question of fact as to whether the
11 signature used for the mail ballot matches the signature of the voter,
12 the voter must be identified by:
13 (a) Answering questions from the city clerk covering the
14 personal data which is reported on the application to register to vote;
15 (b) Providing the city clerk, orally or in writing, including,
16 without limitation, in writing by electronic mail or text message,
17 with other personal data which verifies the identity of the voter; or
18 (c) Providing the city clerk with proof of identification as
19 described in NRS 293C.270 other than the voter registration card
20 issued to the voter.
21 9. The procedures established pursuant to subsection 7 for
22 contacting a voter must require the clerk to contact the voter, as
23 soon as possible after receipt of the mail ballot, by:
24 (a) Mail;
25 (b) Telephone, if a telephone number for the voter is available in
26 the records of the clerk; and
27 (c) Electronic means, which [may] must include, without
28 limitation [, electronic] :
29 (1) Electronic mail, if the voter has provided the clerk with
30 [sufficient information to contact the voter by such means.] an
31 electronic mail address; and
32 (2) Text message, if the voter has provided the clerk with a
33 cellular telephone number.
34 Sec. 10. The provisions of NRS 354.599 do not apply to any
35 additional expenses of a local government that are related to the
36 provisions of this act.
37 Sec. 11. 1. This section and section 10 of this act become
38 effective upon passage and approval.
39 2. Sections 1 to 9, inclusive, of this act become effective:
40 (a) Upon passage and approval for the purpose of adopting any
41 regulations and performing any other preparatory administrative
42 tasks that are necessary to carry out the provisions of this act; and

~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to elections; requiring each county clerk to
establish and maintain a voter services portal on the
Internet website of the office of the county clerk;
requiring the county clerk to include certain information
relating to the voter services portal on any communication
to a registered voter; requiring the Department of Motor
Vehicles to submit electronically to each county clerk
certain information relating to each person who has a
driver’s license or identification card issued by the
Department; requiring the county clerk to include certain
information received from the Department in the
centralized, top-down database that is established by the
Secretary of State for purposes of creating the statewide
voter registration list; requiring certain information to be
included on the return envelope for a mail ballot; revising
provisions relating to signature curing for mail ballots;
providing that certain information on the statewide voter
registration list relating to a voter is confidential and not a
public record; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Section 2 of this bill requires each county clerk to establish and maintain a
2 voter services portal on the Internet website of the office of the county clerk, which
3 must allow any registered voter in the county to: (1) review his or her voter
-
*AB499_R1*

– 2 –
4 registration information; (2) print any form necessary to update his or her voter
5 registration information; (3) view his or her sample ballot; and (4) obtain the
6 location of any polling place where the registered voter may vote or deliver a mail
7 ballot to a ballot drop box. Section 2 further: (1) authorizes a county clerk to
8 request the assistance of the Secretary of State to establish and maintain the voter
9 services portal; and (2) requires the county clerk to include on any communication
10 to a registered voter a two-dimensional barcode, commonly known as a QR code,
11 or another machine-readable code used for storing the Internet address for the voter
12 services portal created by the county clerk pursuant to section 2.
13 Existing law requires, with certain exceptions, the county or city clerk to send
14 to each active registered voter certain information relating to voting by mail,
15 including a mail ballot and a return envelope. (NRS 293.269913, 293C.26312)
16 Sections 4 and 8 of this bill require the return envelope for a mail ballot to include:
17 (1) a space for the voter to voluntarily write certain identifying information; and (2)
18 a QR code or other machine-readable code that directs a voter to the voter services
19 portal on the Internet website of the office of the county clerk.
20 Existing law requires: (1) the Secretary of State to establish and maintain a
21 centralized, top-down database that collects and stores information relating to the
22 preregistration of persons and the registration of electors from all the counties in
23 this State; and (2) each county clerk to use the database to collect and maintain all
24 records of preregistration and registration to vote. Under existing law, the Secretary
25 of State is required to: (1) use the voter registration information collected in the
26 database to create the official statewide voter registration list, which serves as the
27 single method for storing and managing the official list of registered voters in this
28 State; and (2) enter into a cooperative agreement with the Department of Motor
29 Vehicles to match information in the database of the statewide voter registration list
30 with information in the appropriate database of the Department to verify the
31 accuracy of the information in an application to register to vote. (NRS 293.675)
32 Section 3 of this bill requires the Department of Motor Vehicles, on a regular
33 basis, to submit electronically to each county clerk certain information relating to
34 each person who has a driver’s license or identification card issued by the
35 Department. Section 3 further requires the county clerk to: (1) match such
36 information to registered voters in the county; (2) electronically enter into the
37 centralized, top-down database such information for each registered voter in the
38 county as soon as practicable after matching the information to registered voters in
39 the county; (3) identify any person who is a registered voter in the county and does
40 not have a driver’s license or identification card; and (4) indicate in the database
41 whether each registered voter in the county has a driver’s license or identification
42 card issued by the Department. Section 7 of this bill requires the information
43 submitted to the county clerk by the Department to be included on the statewide
44 voter registration list.
45 Existing law provides that certain information relating to a registered voter is
46 confidential and not a public record. (NRS 293.558) Section 6 of this bill provides
47 that the information submitted to the county clerk by the Department pursuant to
48 section 3 is also confidential and not a public record.
49 Existing law requires a voter who votes by mail to affix his or her signature in
50 the space provided on the return envelope of a mail ballot and the county clerk or
51 city clerk to check the signature to verify the identity of the voter. (NRS
52 293.269917, 293.269927, 293C.26316, 293C.26327) Existing law provides that if
53 the county clerk or city clerk determines when checking the signature used for the
54 mail ballot that the voter failed to affix his or her signature or failed to affix it in the
55 manner required by law or that there is a reasonable question of fact as to whether
56 the signature used for the mail ballot matches the signature of the voter, the clerk is
57 required to contact the voter and advise the voter of the procedures to provide a
58 signature or a confirmation, as applicable. For the mail ballot to be counted, the
-
*AB499_R1*

– 3 –
59 voter must provide a signature or a confirmation, as applicable, not later than 5 p.m.
60 on the sixth day following the election. (NRS 293.269927, 293C.26327) Sections 5
61 and 9 of this bill make various changes to the signature curing process. First,
62 sections 5 and 9 provide that if the voter included on the return envelope the last
63 four digits of the voter’s driver’s license, the last four digits of the voter’s social
64 security number or the voter’s voter identification number and such information is
65 confirmed by the clerk to be accurate, the voter is entitled to cast the ballot and the
66 signature is not required to be verified. If the voter did not include such information
67 on the return envelope or the information provided on the return envelope is not
68 accurate, the clerk or an employee in the office of the clerk is required to check the
69 signature. Second, sections 5 and 9 require that: (1) the county clerk and city clerk
70 ensure that employees are available by telephone until at least 7 p.m. on evenings
71 and weekends during the signature curing period; and (2) any voicemail message or
72 hold message used by the office of the clerk provides instructions on how a voter
73 may provide a signature or a signature confirmation. Finally, sections 5 and 9
74 authorize a voter to confirm his or her signature on the return envelope by
75 electronic mail or text message.
