Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires, under certain circumstances, a person to provide certain
2 information to vote in person, which may include depending on the circumstances,
3 the voter’s signature, proof of residency and identify, answering questions covering
4 the voter’s personal data or providing additional personal data. (NRS 293.2725,
5 293.277, 293.285, 293.303, 293.3081, 293.3082, 293.3085, 293.3585, 293.541,
6 293C.270, 293C.275, 293C.292, 293C.3035, 293C.3585) Section 1.4 of this bill
7 requires that, in order to vote in person in any election, a registered voter verify his
8 or her identity by presenting certain forms of photo identification. If a registered
9 voter does not have a form of photo identification, section 1.4 authorizes the
10 registered voter to cast a provisional ballot. Sections 5.28-5.32 of this bill require
11 such a voter to provide photo identification not later than 5 p.m. on the Friday
12 following election day in order for such a provisional ballot to be counted.
13 Sections 5.14-5.24 and 9.12-9.2 of this bill make conforming changes to the
14 requirement that voters present photo identification to vote in person, including
15 eliminating existing requirements for the signatures of voters to be verified for in
16 person voting.
17 Sections 5.26 and 9.22 of this bill apply the requirement for voters to show
18 photo identification to voting at polling places established as vote centers.
19 Sections 5.34, 5.36, 9.24 and 9.26 of this bill apply the requirement for voters
20 to show photo identification to the period for early voting.
21 Section 1.6 of this bill requires the Department of Motor Vehicles to issue an
22 identification card at no charge to certain registered voters who are experiencing a
23 financial hardship.
24 Section 1.8 of this bill requires the Secretary of State to issue a digital
25 identification card at no charge to a registered voter. Section 9.5 provides that the
26 Secretary of State is not required to issue such digital identification cards until
27 January 1, 2028.
28 Existing law: (1) requires a general election to be held on the first Tuesday after
29 the first Monday of November in each even-numbered year; and (2) provides that
30 the period for early voting by personal appearance begins the third Saturday
31 preceding a general election and extends through the Friday before election day.
32 (NRS 293.12755, 293.3568) Existing law further requires each county clerk to
33 establish: (1) a certain number of polling places where a person can vote during the
34 period for early voting by personal appearance and on the day of the general
35 election; and (2) a ballot drop box at every polling place in the county, including a
36 polling place for early voting. (NRS 293.269921, 293.2731, 293.3564) Section 1.84
37 of this bill: (1) requires each county clerk in certain counties to, for the period
38 beginning on the day after the last day for early voting by personal appearance and
-
*AB499_R2*
– 3 –
39 ending on the day before the day of the general election, establish a certain number
40 of locations where a voter may return his or her mail ballot in a mail ballot drop
41 box; and (2) requires such locations to be open for at least 7 hours each day, but not
42 more than 12 hours each day, during that period. Specifically, in a county whose
43 population is 700,000 or more (currently only Clark County), a county is required
44 to establish 10 such locations, and in a county whose population is 100,000 or more
45 but less than 700,000 (currently only Washoe County), a county clerk is required to
46 establish 5 such locations. Section 1.84 further authorizes a county clerk in a
47 county whose population is less than 100,000 (currently all counties other than
48 Clark and Washoe Counties) to establish any number of such locations and
49 prescribe the hours for such locations to be open. Each location that is established
50 by a county clerk pursuant to section 1.84 must be at a polling place that is used for
51 early voting by personal appearance or a polling place for voting in person on the
52 day of the election.
53 Section 4.6 of this bill provides that a mail ballot dropped in a mail ballot drop
54 box pursuant to section 1.84 counts as a vote in the general election. Section 4.8 of
55 this bill makes a conforming change to make certain provisions relating to mail
56 ballots generally applicable to section 1.84.
57 Existing law requires a ballot drop box to meet certain requirements, including
58 a requirement for the ballot drop box to be made available for use during the hours
59 when the office of the county or city clerk or the polling place is open for business
60 or voting, as applicable. (NRS 293.269921, 293C.26321) Sections 4.6 and 8.7 of
61 this bill require a ballot drop box to be: (1) monitored at all times during such a
62 period; and (2) secured during any period of time in which the ballot drop box is
63 not available for use. Sections 4.6 and 8.7 additionally require the Secretary of
64 State to adopt regulations to establish requirements for monitoring and securing
65 ballot drop boxes.
66 Existing law authorizes, at the request of a voter whose mail ballot has been
67 prepared by or on behalf of the voter, a person authorized by the voter to return the
68 mail ballot on behalf of the voter by mail or personal delivery to the county clerk,
69 or any ballot drop box established in the county by the county clerk. (NRS
70 293.269923) Section 4.7 of this bill additionally authorizes a person, under such
71 circumstances, to return a mail ballot on behalf of a voter by returning the mail
72 ballot to a mail ballot drop box established pursuant to section 1.84.
73 Section 2 of this bill requires the Secretary of State to establish and maintain a
74 voter services portal on the Internet website of the Office of the Secretary of State,
75 which must allow any registered voter in the State to: (1) review his or her voter
76 registration information; (2) print any form necessary to update his or her voter
77 registration information; (3) view his or her sample ballot; and (4) obtain the
78 location of any polling place where the registered voter may vote or deliver a mail
79 ballot to a ballot drop box. Section 2 further requires the county clerk to include on
80 any communication to a registered voter a two-dimensional barcode, commonly
81 known as a QR code, or another machine-readable code used for storing the
82 Internet address for the voter services portal created by the Secretary of State.
83 Existing law requires, with certain exceptions, the county or city clerk to send
84 to each active registered voter certain information relating to voting by mail,
85 including a mail ballot, a return envelope and instructions. (NRS 293.269913,
86 293C.26312) Sections 4 and 8 of this bill require the return envelope for a mail
87 ballot to include: (1) a space for the voter to write certain identifying information;
88 and (2) a QR code or other machine-readable code that directs a voter to the voter
89 services portal on the Internet website of the Office of the Secretary of State.
90 Sections 4 and 8 also require the instructions include: (1) an explanation that the
91 voter must write on the return envelope an identifying number; and (2) the QR code
92 or other machine-readable code that directs a voter to the voter services portal.

93 Existing law requires the Secretary of State to prescribe the form of all
94 envelopes in which mail ballots are sent to voters and return envelopes. (NRS
95 293.269913, 293C.26312) Sections 4 and 8 require that the design of all envelopes
96 used by the county or city clerk to send mail ballots to registered voters and return
97 envelopes must be submitted to and approved by the Secretary of State prior to use
98 in any election.
99 Existing law requires: (1) the Secretary of State to establish and maintain a
100 centralized, top-down database that collects and stores information relating to the
101 preregistration of persons and the registration of electors from all the counties in
102 this State; and (2) each county clerk to use the database to collect and maintain all
103 records of preregistration and registration to vote. Under existing law, the Secretary
104 of State is required to: (1) use the voter registration information collected in the
105 database to create the official statewide voter registration list, which serves as the
106 single method for storing and managing the official list of registered voters in this
107 State; and (2) enter into a cooperative agreement with the Department of Motor
108 Vehicles to match information in the database of the statewide voter registration list
109 with information in the appropriate database of the Department to verify the
110 accuracy of the information in an application to register to vote. (NRS 293.675)
111 Section 3 of this bill requires the Department of Motor Vehicles, on a regular
112 basis, to submit electronically to the Secretary of State certain information relating
113 to each person who has a driver’s license or identification card issued by the
114 Department. Section 3 further requires the Secretary of State to: (1) match such
115 information to registered voters; (2) electronically enter into the centralized, top-
116 down database such information for each registered voter as soon as practicable
117 after matching the information to registered voters; (3) identify any person who is a
118 registered voter and does not possess a driver’s license or identification card; and
119 (4) indicate in the database whether each registered voter possesses a driver’s
120 license or identification card issued by the Department. Section 7 of this bill
121 requires the information submitted to the Secretary of State by the Department to be
122 included on the statewide voter registration list.
123 Existing law provides that certain information relating to a registered voter is
124 confidential and not a public record. (NRS 293.558) Section 6 of this bill provides
125 that the information submitted to the Secretary of State by the Department pursuant
126 to section 3 is also confidential and not a public record.
127 Existing law requires a voter who votes by mail to affix his or her signature in
128 the space provided on the return envelope of a mail ballot and the county clerk or
129 city clerk to check the signature to verify the identity of the voter. (NRS
130 293.269917, 293.269927, 293C.26316, 293C.26327) Sections 4.5 and 8.5 of this
131 bill require that a voter who votes by mail ballot to also write on the return
132 envelope: (1) the last four digits of his voter’s driver’s license issued by the
133 Department of Motor Vehicles; (2) if the voter does not possess a driver’s license

135 social security number; or (3) if the voter does not possess a driver’s license issued
136 by the Department of Motor Vehicles or a social security number, the voter

138 Existing law provides that if the county clerk or city clerk determines when
139 checking the signature used for the mail ballot that the voter failed to affix his or
140 her signature or failed to affix it in the manner required by law or that there is a
141 reasonable question of fact as to whether the signature used for the mail ballot
142 matches the signature of the voter, the clerk is required to contact the voter and
143 advise the voter of the procedures to provide a signature or a confirmation, as
144 applicable. For the mail ballot to be counted, the voter must provide a signature or a
145 confirmation, as applicable, not later than 5 p.m. on the sixth day following the

148 provide that the clerk is required to check the return envelope to determine whether
149 the voter included on the return envelope his or her signature and the identifying
150 number that is required pursuant to section 4.5 or 8.5, as applicable. If the return
151 envelope does not include a signature and identifying number, the clerk is required
152 to contact the voter. If the return envelope includes a signature and identifying
153 number, the clerk is required to check the voter’s signature. If the signature is
154 verified, the voter is entitled to cast the mail ballot and the identifying number is

168 election in which a mechanical voting system is used.

23 for the mail ballot , or [that there is a reasonable question of fact as

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires, under certain circumstances, a person to provide certain
2 information to vote in person, which may include depending on the circumstances,
3 the voter’s signature, proof of residency and identify, answering questions covering
4 the voter’s personal data or providing additional personal data. (NRS 293.2725,
5 293.277, 293.285, 293.303, 293.3081, 293.3082, 293.3085, 293.3585, 293.541,
6 293C.270, 293C.275, 293C.292, 293C.3035, 293C.3585) Section 1.4 of this bill
7 requires that, in order to vote in person in any election, a registered voter verify his
8 or her identity by presenting certain forms of photo identification. If a registered
9 voter does not have a form of photo identification, section 1.4 authorizes the
10 registered voter to cast a provisional ballot. Sections 5.28-5.32 of this bill require
11 such a voter to provide photo identification not later than 5 p.m. on the Friday
12 following election day in order for such a provisional ballot to be counted.
13 Sections 5.14-5.24 and 9.12-9.2 of this bill make conforming changes to the
14 requirement that voters present photo identification to vote in person, including
15 eliminating existing requirements for the signatures of voters to be verified for in
16 person voting.
17 Sections 5.26 and 9.22 of this bill apply the requirement for voters to show
18 photo identification to voting at polling places established as vote centers.
19 Sections 5.34, 5.36, 9.24 and 9.26 of this bill apply the requirement for voters
20 to show photo identification to the period for early voting.
21 Section 1.6 of this bill requires the Department of Motor Vehicles to issue an
22 identification card at no charge to certain registered voters who are experiencing a
23 financial hardship.
24 Section 1.8 of this bill requires the Secretary of State to issue a digital
25 identification card at no charge to a registered voter. Section 9.5 provides that the
26 Secretary of State is not required to issue such digital identification cards until
27 January 1, 2028.
28 Existing law: (1) requires a general election to be held on the first Tuesday after
29 the first Monday of November in each even-numbered year; and (2) provides that
30 the period for early voting by personal appearance begins the third Saturday
31 preceding a general election and extends through the Friday before election day.
32 (NRS 293.12755, 293.3568) Existing law further requires each county clerk to
33 establish: (1) a certain number of polling places where a person can vote during the
34 period for early voting by personal appearance and on the day of the general
35 election; and (2) a ballot drop box at every polling place in the county, including a
36 polling place for early voting. (NRS 293.269921, 293.2731, 293.3564) Section 1.84
37 of this bill: (1) requires each county clerk in certain counties to, for the period
38 beginning on the day after the last day for early voting by personal appearance and
-
*AB499_R2*

– 3 –
39 ending on the day before the day of the general election, establish a certain number
40 of locations where a voter may return his or her mail ballot in a mail ballot drop
41 box; and (2) requires such locations to be open for at least 7 hours each day, but not
42 more than 12 hours each day, during that period. Specifically, in a county whose
43 population is 700,000 or more (currently only Clark County), a county is required
44 to establish 10 such locations, and in a county whose population is 100,000 or more
45 but less than 700,000 (currently only Washoe County), a county clerk is required to
46 establish 5 such locations. Section 1.84 further authorizes a county clerk in a
47 county whose population is less than 100,000 (currently all counties other than
48 Clark and Washoe Counties) to establish any number of such locations and
49 prescribe the hours for such locations to be open. Each location that is established
50 by a county clerk pursuant to section 1.84 must be at a polling place that is used for
51 early voting by personal appearance or a polling place for voting in person on the
52 day of the election.
53 Section 4.6 of this bill provides that a mail ballot dropped in a mail ballot drop
54 box pursuant to section 1.84 counts as a vote in the general election. Section 4.8 of
55 this bill makes a conforming change to make certain provisions relating to mail
56 ballots generally applicable to section 1.84.
57 Existing law requires a ballot drop box to meet certain requirements, including
58 a requirement for the ballot drop box to be made available for use during the hours
59 when the office of the county or city clerk or the polling place is open for business
60 or voting, as applicable. (NRS 293.269921, 293C.26321) Sections 4.6 and 8.7 of
61 this bill require a ballot drop box to be: (1) monitored at all times during such a
62 period; and (2) secured during any period of time in which the ballot drop box is
63 not available for use. Sections 4.6 and 8.7 additionally require the Secretary of
64 State to adopt regulations to establish requirements for monitoring and securing
65 ballot drop boxes.
66 Existing law authorizes, at the request of a voter whose mail ballot has been
67 prepared by or on behalf of the voter, a person authorized by the voter to return the
68 mail ballot on behalf of the voter by mail or personal delivery to the county clerk,
69 or any ballot drop box established in the county by the county clerk. (NRS
70 293.269923) Section 4.7 of this bill additionally authorizes a person, under such
71 circumstances, to return a mail ballot on behalf of a voter by returning the mail
72 ballot to a mail ballot drop box established pursuant to section 1.84.
73 Section 2 of this bill requires the Secretary of State to establish and maintain a
74 voter services portal on the Internet website of the Office of the Secretary of State,
75 which must allow any registered voter in the State to: (1) review his or her voter
76 registration information; (2) print any form necessary to update his or her voter
77 registration information; (3) view his or her sample ballot; and (4) obtain the
78 location of any polling place where the registered voter may vote or deliver a mail
79 ballot to a ballot drop box. Section 2 further requires the county clerk to include on
80 any communication to a registered voter a two-dimensional barcode, commonly
81 known as a QR code, or another machine-readable code used for storing the
82 Internet address for the voter services portal created by the Secretary of State.
83 Existing law requires, with certain exceptions, the county or city clerk to send
84 to each active registered voter certain information relating to voting by mail,
85 including a mail ballot, a return envelope and instructions. (NRS 293.269913,
86 293C.26312) Sections 4 and 8 of this bill require the return envelope for a mail
87 ballot to include: (1) a space for the voter to write certain identifying information;
88 and (2) a QR code or other machine-readable code that directs a voter to the voter
89 services portal on the Internet website of the Office of the Secretary of State.
90 Sections 4 and 8 also require the instructions include: (1) an explanation that the
91 voter must write on the return envelope an identifying number; and (2) the QR code
92 or other machine-readable code that directs a voter to the voter services portal.

93 Existing law requires the Secretary of State to prescribe the form of all
94 envelopes in which mail ballots are sent to voters and return envelopes. (NRS
95 293.269913, 293C.26312) Sections 4 and 8 require that the design of all envelopes
96 used by the county or city clerk to send mail ballots to registered voters and return
97 envelopes must be submitted to and approved by the Secretary of State prior to use
98 in any election.
99 Existing law requires: (1) the Secretary of State to establish and maintain a
100 centralized, top-down database that collects and stores information relating to the
101 preregistration of persons and the registration of electors from all the counties in
102 this State; and (2) each county clerk to use the database to collect and maintain all
103 records of preregistration and registration to vote. Under existing law, the Secretary
104 of State is required to: (1) use the voter registration information collected in the
105 database to create the official statewide voter registration list, which serves as the
106 single method for storing and managing the official list of registered voters in this
107 State; and (2) enter into a cooperative agreement with the Department of Motor
108 Vehicles to match information in the database of the statewide voter registration list
109 with information in the appropriate database of the Department to verify the
110 accuracy of the information in an application to register to vote. (NRS 293.675)
111 Section 3 of this bill requires the Department of Motor Vehicles, on a regular
112 basis, to submit electronically to the Secretary of State certain information relating
113 to each person who has a driver’s license or identification card issued by the
114 Department. Section 3 further requires the Secretary of State to: (1) match such
115 information to registered voters; (2) electronically enter into the centralized, top-
116 down database such information for each registered voter as soon as practicable
117 after matching the information to registered voters; (3) identify any person who is a
118 registered voter and does not possess a driver’s license or identification card; and
119 (4) indicate in the database whether each registered voter possesses a driver’s
120 license or identification card issued by the Department. Section 7 of this bill
121 requires the information submitted to the Secretary of State by the Department to be
122 included on the statewide voter registration list.
123 Existing law provides that certain information relating to a registered voter is
124 confidential and not a public record. (NRS 293.558) Section 6 of this bill provides
125 that the information submitted to the Secretary of State by the Department pursuant
126 to section 3 is also confidential and not a public record.
127 Existing law requires a voter who votes by mail to affix his or her signature in
128 the space provided on the return envelope of a mail ballot and the county clerk or
129 city clerk to check the signature to verify the identity of the voter. (NRS

6 names and it does not otherwise differ in multiple, significant and

10 used for the mail ballot and the signatures of the voter available in

16 under the control of the clerk at all times. The clerk shall deliver the
17 mail ballots to the mail ballot central counting board to be processed
18 and prepared for counting.
19 6. If the clerk determines when checking the [signature used]
20 return envelope for the mail ballot that the voter failed to affix his
21 or her signature [or] and identifying number, failed to affix [it] the
22 signature and identifying number in the manner required by law
23 for the mail ballot , or [that there is a reasonable question of fact as
24 to whether the signature used for the mail ballot matches the
25 signature of the voter,] the clerk is not able to verify the signature
26 or identifying number but the voter is otherwise entitled to cast the
27 mail ballot, the clerk shall contact the voter and advise the voter of
28 the procedures to provide a signature or an identifying number, or a
29 confirmation that the signature or identifying number used for the
