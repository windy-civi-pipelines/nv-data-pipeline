-

– 2 –
7 ballot to a ballot drop box. Section 2 further authorizes a county clerk to request the
8 assistance of the Secretary of State to establish and maintain the voter services
9 portal.
10 Existing law requires, with certain exceptions, the county or city clerk to send
11 to each active registered voter certain information relating to voting by mail,
12 including a mail ballot and a return envelope. (NRS 293.269913, 293C.26312)
13 Sections 4 and 8 of this bill require the return envelope for a mail ballot to include:
14 (1) a space for the voter to voluntarily write certain identifying information; and (2)
15 a QR code or other machine-readable code that directs a voter to the voter services
16 portal on the Internet website of the office of the county clerk.
17 Existing law requires: (1) the Secretary of State to establish and maintain a
18 centralized, top-down database that collects and stores information relating to the
19 preregistration of persons and the registration of electors from all the counties in
20 this State; and (2) each county clerk to use the database to collect and maintain all
21 records of preregistration and registration to vote. Under existing law, the Secretary
22 of State is required to: (1) use the voter registration information collected in the
23 database to create the official statewide voter registration list, which serves as the
24 single method for storing and managing the official list of registered voters in this
25 State; and (2) enter into a cooperative agreement with the Department of Motor
26 Vehicles to match information in the database of the statewide voter registration list
27 with information in the appropriate database of the Department to verify the
28 accuracy of the information in an application to register to vote. (NRS 293.675)
29 Section 3 of this bill requires the Department of Motor Vehicles, on a regular
30 basis, to submit electronically to each county clerk certain information relating to
31 each person who has a driver’s license or identification card issued by the
32 Department. Section 3 further requires the county clerk to: (1) match such
33 information to registered voters in the county; (2) electronically enter into the
34 centralized, top-down database such information for each registered voter in the
35 county as soon as practicable after matching the information to registered voters in
36 the county; (3) identify any person who is a registered voter in the county and does
37 not have a driver’s license or identification card; and (4) indicate in the database
38 whether each registered voter in the county has a driver’s license or identification
39 card issued by the Department. Section 7 of this bill requires the information
40 submitted to the county clerk by the Department to be included on the statewide
41 voter registration list.
42 Existing law provides that certain information relating to a registered voter is
43 confidential and not a public record. (NRS 293.558) Section 6 of this bill provides
44 that the information submitted to the county clerk by the Department pursuant to
45 section 3 is also confidential and not a public record.
46 Existing law requires a voter who votes by mail to affix his or her signature in
47 the space provided on the return envelope of a mail ballot and the county clerk or
48 city clerk to check the signature to verify the identity of the voter. (NRS
49 293.269917, 293.269927, 293C.26316, 293C.26327) Existing law provides that if
50 the county clerk or city clerk determines when checking the signature used for the
51 mail ballot that the voter failed to affix his or her signature or failed to affix it in the
52 manner required by law or that there is a reasonable question of fact as to whether
53 the signature used for the mail ballot matches the signature of the voter, the clerk is
54 required to contact the voter and advise the voter of the procedures to provide a
55 signature or a confirmation, as applicable. For the mail ballot to be counted, the
56 voter must provide a signature or a confirmation, as applicable, not later than 5 p.m.
57 on the sixth day following the election. (NRS 293.269927, 293C.26327) Sections 5
58 and 9 of this bill make various changes to the signature curing process. First,
59 sections 5 and 9 provide that if the voter included on the return envelope the last
60 four digits of the voter’s driver’s license, the last four digits of the voter’s social
61 security number or the voter’s voter identification number and such information is
-

62 confirmed by the clerk to be accurate, the voter is entitled to cast the ballot and the
63 signature is not required to be verified. If the voter did not include such information
64 on the return envelope or the information provided on the return envelope is not
65 accurate, the clerk or an employee in the office of the clerk is required to check the
66 signature. Second, sections 5 and 9 require that: (1) the county clerk and city clerk
67 ensure that employees are available by telephone on evenings and weekends during
68 the signature curing period; and (2) any voicemail message or hold message used
69 by the office of the clerk provides instructions on how a voter may provide a
70 signature or a signature confirmation. Finally, sections 5 and 9 authorize a voter to
71 confirm his or her signature on the return envelope by electronic mail or text
72 message.

10 (c) An envelope or sleeve into which the mail ballot is inserted
11 to ensure its secrecy; and
12 (d) Instructions [.] that include, without limitation:

15 and
16 (2) A two-dimensional barcode, commonly known as a QR

18 Internet address for the voter services portal on the Internet
19 website of the county clerk.
20 2. In sending a mail ballot to an active registered voter, the city
21 clerk shall use an envelope that may not be forwarded to an address
22 of the voter that is different from the address to which the mail
23 ballot is mailed.
24 3. The return envelope must include postage prepaid by first-
25 class mail if the active registered voter is within the boundaries of
26 the United States, its territories or possessions or on a military base.
27 4. Before sending a mail ballot to an active registered voter, the
28 city clerk shall record:
29 (a) The date the mail ballot is issued;
30 (b) The name of the voter to whom the mail ballot is issued, his
31 or her precinct or district and his or her political affiliation, if any,
32 unless all the offices on the mail ballot are nonpartisan offices;
33 (c) The number of the mail ballot; and
34 (d) Any remarks the city clerk finds appropriate.

44 293C.26327 1. Except as otherwise provided in NRS
45 293D.200, when a mail ballot is returned by or on behalf of a voter
-
*AB499*

– 13 –
1 to the city clerk, and a record of its return is made in the mail ballot
2 record for the election, the clerk or an employee in the office of the
3 clerk shall check the return envelope to determine whether the
4 voter included on the return envelope the last four digits of
5 the voter’s driver’s license, the last four digits of the voter’s social
6 security number or the voter’s voter identification number. If the
7 return envelope includes any such information and such
8 information is confirmed by the clerk to be accurate, the voter is
9 entitled to cast the mail ballot and the signature is not required to
10 be checked. If the voter did not include such information on the
11 return envelope or the information provided on the return
12 envelope is not accurate, the clerk or an employee in the office of
13 the clerk must check the signature used for the mail ballot by
14 electronic means pursuant to subsection 2 or manually pursuant to
15 subsection 3.
16 2. To check the signature used for a mail ballot by electronic
17 means:
18 (a) The electronic device must take a digital image of the
19 signature used for the mail ballot and electronically compare the
20 digital image with the signatures of the voter from his or her
21 application to register to vote or application to preregister to vote
22 available in the records of the city clerk.
23 (b) If the electronic device does not match the signature of the
24 voter, the signature shall be reviewed manually pursuant to the
25 provisions of subsection 3.
26 3. To check the signature used for a mail ballot manually, the
27 city clerk shall use the following procedure:
28 (a) The clerk or employee shall check the signature used for the
29 mail ballot against all signatures of the voter available in the records
30 of the clerk.
31 (b) If at least two employees in the office of the clerk believe
32 there is a reasonable question of fact as to whether the signature
33 used for the mail ballot matches the signature of the voter, the clerk
34 shall contact the voter and ask the voter to confirm whether the
35 signature used for the mail ballot belongs to the voter.
36 4. For purposes of subsection 3:
37 (a) There is a reasonable question of fact as to whether the
38 signature used for the mail ballot matches the signature of the voter
39 if the signature used for the mail ballot differs in multiple,
40 significant and obvious respects from the signatures of the voter
41 available in the records of the clerk.
42 (b) There is not a reasonable question of fact as to whether the
43 signature used for the mail ballot matches the signature of the voter
44 if:
-
*AB499*

– 14 –
1 (1) The signature used for the mail ballot is a variation of the
2 signature of the voter caused by the substitution of initials for the
3 first or middle name, the substitution of a different type of
4 punctuation in the first, middle or last name, the use of a common
5 nickname or the use of one last name for a person who has two last
6 names and it does not otherwise differ in multiple, significant and
7 obvious respects from the signatures of the voter available in the
8 records of the clerk; or
9 (2) There are only slight dissimilarities between the signature
10 used for the mail ballot and the signatures of the voter available in
11 the records of the clerk.
12 5. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 6, if the clerk
13 determines that the voter is entitled to cast the mail ballot, the clerk
14 shall deposit the mail ballot in the proper ballot box or place the
15 mail ballot, unopened, in a container that must be securely locked or
16 under the control of the clerk at all times. The clerk shall deliver the
17 mail ballots to the mail ballot central counting board to be processed
18 and prepared for counting.
19 6. If the clerk determines when checking the signature used for
20 the mail ballot that the voter failed to affix his or her signature or
21 failed to affix it in the manner required by law for the mail ballot or
22 that there is a reasonable question of fact as to whether the signature
23 used for the mail ballot matches the signature of the voter, but the
24 voter is otherwise entitled to cast the mail ballot, the clerk shall
25 contact the voter and advise the voter of the procedures to provide a
26 signature or a confirmation that the signature used for the mail ballot
27 belongs to the voter, as applicable. For the mail ballot to be counted,
28 the voter must provide a signature or a confirmation, as applicable,
29 not later than 5 p.m. on the sixth day following the election. During
30 the period in which signatures may be cured, the clerk shall
31 ensure that employees in the office of the clerk are available by
32 telephone on evenings and weekends. Any voicemail message or
33 hold message used by the office of the clerk must provide
34 instructions on how a voter may provide a signature or a
35 confirmation.
36 7. The clerk shall prescribe procedures for a voter who failed to
37 affix his or her signature or failed to affix it in the manner required
38 by law for the mail ballot, or for whom there is a reasonable
39 question of fact as to whether the signature used for the mail ballot
40 matches the signature of the voter, in order to:
41 (a) Contact the voter;
42 (b) Allow the voter to provide a signature or a confirmation that
43 the signature used for the mail ballot belongs to the voter, as
44 applicable; and
-
*AB499*

– 15 –
1 (c) After a signature or a confirmation is provided, as applicable,
2 ensure the mail ballot is delivered to the mail ballot central counting
3 board.
4 8. If there is a reasonable question of fact as to whether the
5 signature used for the mail ballot matches the signature of the voter,
6 the voter must be identified by:
7 (a) Answering questions from the city clerk covering the
8 personal data which is reported on the application to register to vote;
9 (b) Providing the city clerk, orally or in writing, including,
10 without limitation, in writing by electronic mail or text message,
11 with other personal data which verifies the identity of the voter; or
12 (c) Providing the city clerk with proof of identification as
13 described in NRS 293C.270 other than the voter registration card
14 issued to the voter.
15 9. The procedures established pursuant to subsection 7 for
16 contacting a voter must require the clerk to contact the voter, as
17 soon as possible after receipt of the mail ballot, by:
18 (a) Mail;
19 (b) Telephone, if a telephone number for the voter is available in
20 the records of the clerk; and
21 (c) Electronic means, which [may] must include, without
22 limitation [, electronic] :
23 (1) Electronic mail, if the voter has provided the clerk with
24 [sufficient information to contact the voter by such means.] an
25 electronic mail address; and
26 (2) Text message, if the voter has provided the clerk with a
27 cellular telephone number.
28 Sec. 10. The provisions of NRS 354.599 do not apply to any
29 additional expenses of a local government that are related to the
30 provisions of this act.
31 Sec. 11. 1. This section and section 10 of this act become
32 effective upon passage and approval.
33 2. Sections 1 to 9, inclusive, of this act become effective:
34 (a) Upon passage and approval for the purpose of adopting any
35 regulations and performing any other preparatory administrative
