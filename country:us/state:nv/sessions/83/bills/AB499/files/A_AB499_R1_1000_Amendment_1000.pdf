Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires, under certain circumstances, a person to provide certain
2 information to vote in person, which may include depending on the circumstances, the
3 voter’s signature, proof of residency and identify, answering questions covering the
4 voter’s personal data or providing additional personal data. (NRS 293.2725, 293.277,
5 293.285, 293.303, 293.3081, 293.3082, 293.3085, 293.3585, 293.541, 293C.270, 293C.275,
6 293C.292, 293C.3035, 293C.3585) Section 1.4 of this bill requires that, in order to vote in
7 person in any election, a registered voter verify his or her identity by presenting certain
8 forms of photo identification. If a registered voter does not have a form of photo
9 identification, section 1.4 authorizes the registered voter to cast a provisional ballot.
10 Sections 5.28-5.32 of this bill require such a voter to provide photo identification not
11 later than 5 p.m. on the Friday following election day in order for such a provisional
12 ballot to be counted.
13 Sections 5.14-5.24 and 9.12-9.2 of this bill make conforming changes to the
14 requirement that voters present photo identification to vote in person, including
15 eliminating existing requirements for the signatures of voters to be verified for in person
16 voting.
17 Sections 5.26 and 9.22 of this bill apply the requirement for voters to show photo
18 identification to voting at polling places established as vote centers.
19 Sections 5.34, 5.36, 9.24 and 9.26 of this bill apply the requirement for voters to show
20 photo identification to the period for early voting.
21 Section 1.6 of this bill requires the Department of Motor Vehicles to issue an
22 identification card at no charge to certain registered voters who are experiencing a
23 financial hardship.
24 Section 1.8 of this bill requires the Secretary of State to issue a digital identification
25 card at no charge to a registered voter. Section 9.5 provides that the Secretary of State is
26 not required to issue such digital identification cards until January 1, 2028.
27 Existing law: (1) requires a general election to be held on the first Tuesday after the
28 first Monday of November in each even-numbered year; and (2) provides that the period
29 for early voting by personal appearance begins the third Saturday preceding a general
30 election and extends through the Friday before election day. (NRS 293.12755, 293.3568)
31 Existing law further requires each county clerk to establish: (1) a certain number of
32 polling places where a person can vote during the period for early voting by personal
33 appearance and on the day of the general election; and (2) a ballot drop box at every
34 polling place in the county, including a polling place for early voting. (NRS 293.269921,
35 293.2731, 293.3564) Section 1.84 of this bill: (1) requires each county clerk in certain
36 counties to, for the period beginning on the day after the last day for early voting by
37 personal appearance and ending on the day before the day of the general election,
38 establish a certain number of locations where a voter may return his or her mail ballot
39 in a mail ballot drop box; and (2) requires such locations to be open for at least 7 hours
40 each day, but not more than 12 hours each day, during that period. Specifically, in a
41 county whose population is 700,000 or more (currently only Clark County), a county is
42 required to establish 10 such locations, and in a county whose population is 100,000 or
43 more but less than 700,000 (currently only Washoe County), a county clerk is required
44 to establish 5 such locations. Section 1.84 further authorizes a county clerk in a county
45 whose population is less than 100,000 (currently all counties other than Clark and
46 Washoe Counties) to establish any number of such locations and prescribe the hours for
47 such locations to be open. Each location that is established by a county clerk pursuant to
48 section 1.84 must be at a polling place that is used for early voting by personal
49 appearance or a polling place for voting in person on the day of the election.
50 Section 4.6 of this bill provides that a mail ballot dropped in a mail ballot drop box
51 pursuant to section 1.84 counts as a vote in the general election. Section 4.8 of this bill
52 makes a conforming change to make certain provisions relating to mail ballots generally
53 applicable to section 1.84.

54 Existing law requires a ballot drop box to meet certain requirements, including a
55 requirement for the ballot drop box to be made available for use during the hours when
56 the office of the county or city clerk or the polling place is open for business or voting, as

60 4.6 and 8.7 additionally require the Secretary of State to adopt regulations to establish
61 requirements for monitoring and securing ballot drop boxes.
62 Existing law authorizes, at the request of a voter whose mail ballot has been
63 prepared by or on behalf of the voter, a person authorized by the voter to return the
64 mail ballot on behalf of the voter by mail or personal delivery to the county clerk, or any
65 ballot drop box established in the county by the county clerk. (NRS 293.269923) Section
66 4.7 of this bill additionally authorizes a person, under such circumstances, to return a
67 mail ballot on behalf of a voter by returning the mail ballot to a mail ballot drop box
68 established pursuant to section 1.84.
69 Section 2 of this bill requires [each county clerk] the Secretary of State to establish and

75 ballot drop box. Section 2 further [: (1) authorizes a county clerk to request the assistance of
76 the Secretary of State to establish and maintain the voter services portal; and (2)] requires the
77 county clerk to include on any communication to a registered voter a two-dimensional
78 barcode, commonly known as a QR code, or another machine-readable code used for storing
79 the Internet address for the voter services portal created by the [county clerk pursuant to
80 section 2.] Secretary of State.
81 Existing law requires, with certain exceptions, the county or city clerk to send to each
82 active registered voter certain information relating to voting by mail, including a mail ballot ,
83 [and] a return envelope [.] and instructions. (NRS 293.269913, 293C.26312) Sections 4 and
84 8 of this bill require the return envelope for a mail ballot to include: (1) a space for the voter to
85 [voluntarily] write certain identifying information; and (2) a QR code or other machine-
86 readable code that directs a voter to the voter services portal on the Internet website of the

96 Existing law requires: (1) the Secretary of State to establish and maintain a centralized,
97 top-down database that collects and stores information relating to the preregistration of
98 persons and the registration of electors from all the counties in this State; and (2) each county

100 to vote. Under existing law, the Secretary of State is required to: (1) use the voter registration
101 information collected in the database to create the official statewide voter registration list,
102 which serves as the single method for storing and managing the official list of registered
103 voters in this State; and (2) enter into a cooperative agreement with the Department of Motor
104 Vehicles to match information in the database of the statewide voter registration list with

118 Secretary of State by the Department to be included on the statewide voter registration list.
119 Existing law provides that certain information relating to a registered voter is confidential
120 and not a public record. (NRS 293.558) Section 6 of this bill provides that the information
121 submitted to the [county clerk] Secretary of State by the Department pursuant to section 3 is
122 also confidential and not a public record.
123 Existing law requires a voter who votes by mail to affix his or her signature in the space
124 provided on the return envelope of a mail ballot and the county clerk or city clerk to check the
125 signature to verify the identity of the voter. (NRS 293.269917, 293.269927, 293C.26316,
