8 copyrighted pursuant to federal law.
9 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record
10 which is copyrighted solely because it is copyrighted.

12 public book or record shall not deny a request made pursuant to

14 record on the basis that the requested public book or record contains

26 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
27 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
28 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by

31 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential
32 and that cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from
33 information that is not otherwise confidential.
34 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who
35 has legal custody or control of a public record:
36 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the

38 already prepared or would prefer to provide the copy in a different
39 medium.
40 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon
41 request, prepare the copy of the public record and shall not require
42 the person who has requested the copy to prepare the copy himself
43 or herself.
