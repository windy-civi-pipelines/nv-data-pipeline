EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; requiring [the development and administration of a
program for the postnatal visitation by registered nurses of certain
persons who have recently given birth;] Medicaid to provide
coverage for home visitation services for persons who are pregnant
or have recently given birth; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 [Existing federal law makes available to states grants to establish maternal, infant and
2 early childhood home visiting programs. (42 U.S.C. § 711)] Existing law requires the
3 [Division of Public and Behavioral Health of the] Department of Health and Human Services
4 to administer [a maternal and child health program.] the Medicaid program, which includes
5 coverage for certain services related to postpartum care. (NRS [442.130)] 422.271775)
6 [Section 1 of this bill requires that program to include a program for the postnatal visitation by
7 registered nurses of residents of this State who have recently given birth. Section 1 requires
8 the Department to apply for federal grants and other money to carry out the postnatal
9 visitation program. Section 2 of this bill authorizes the State Board of Health to adopt
10 regulations to carry out the postnatal visitation program.] Section 2.3 of this bill requires the
11 Department to include under Medicaid coverage for optional home visitation services
12 provided to recipients of Medicaid who are pregnant or have given birth within the
13 immediately preceding 24 months. Section 2.3 also requires the Department to notify
14 recipients of Medicaid who are eligible to receive such services. Section 2.7 of this bill
15 makes a conforming change to require the Director of the Department to administer
16 section 2.3 in the same manner as other provisions of law governing Medicaid.
