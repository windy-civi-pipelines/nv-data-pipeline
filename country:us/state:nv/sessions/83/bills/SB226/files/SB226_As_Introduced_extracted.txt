Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes various legislative interim committees that are created
2 or authorized to conduct studies or investigations or perform other legislative
3 business during the interim between legislative sessions, and existing law provides
4 for the appointment or designation of chairs and vice chairs of such interim
5 committees. (Chapter 218E of NRS, NRS 232B.210-232B.250) Existing law also
6 contains provisions that apply exclusively to such interim committees without
7 applying to any session committees. (NRS 218E.105-218E.140)

8 Under existing common-law principles of parliamentary law, the chair of a
9 committee serves as the presiding officer of the committee and may take, direct or
10 require any necessary and reasonable actions to carry out the committee’s
11 management, government, budget, meetings and proceedings, subject to the laws
12 and rules governing the committee. In addition, if a vacancy occurs in the position
13 of chair, or if the chair is prohibited or disqualified from participating or acting on a
14 particular matter for any reason or is absent, disabled or otherwise unavailable or
15 unable to carry out the position for any reason, the vice chair of the committee
16 serves as the acting chair, with all the powers, privileges and immunities of the
17 position of chair, until the vacancy is filled or the chair is eligible, available or able
18 to carry out the position again, as applicable. (Mason’s Manual of Legislative
19 Procedure §§ 575-579, 608-611 (2020); Luther S. Cushing, Elements of the Law &
20 Practice of Legislative Assemblies §§ 287, 308, 313, 314, 1910 (1856); Hicks v.
21 Long Branch Comm’n, 55 A. 250, 250-51 (N.J. 1903)) To assist interim committees
22 in conducting their legislative business consistently with existing common-law
23 principles of parliamentary law, sections 2-4 of this bill codify those existing
24 common-law principles into the statutory provisions that apply to interim
25 committees. (Welfare Div. v. Maynard, 84 Nev. 525, 529 (1968) (“A statutory
26 enactment can be simply a legislative pronouncement of already existing law.”);
27 State Gaming Comm’n v. Southwest Sec., 108 Nev. 379, 383-84 (1992))
28 Existing law: (1) establishes Joint Interim Standing Committees of the
29 Legislature that are authorized to evaluate and review issues within the jurisdiction
30 of the corresponding standing committees from the preceding regular session of the
31 Legislature, exercise certain investigative powers and, under certain circumstances,
32 conduct studies directed by the Legislature or the Legislative Commission; (2)
33 provides for the appointment of regular members and alternate members to each
34 Joint Interim Standing Committee; and (3) requires the Legislative Commission to
35 select a Chair and a Vice Chair for each Joint Interim Standing Committee. (NRS
36 218E.320, 218E.330)
37 Section 5 of this bill requires the appointing authorities to appoint the
38 committee members for each Joint Interim Standing Committee, along with the
39 Chairs and Vice Chairs, not later than August 31 following the adjournment of each
40 regular session. Section 5 also clarifies the length of the terms that the committee
41 members and the Chairs and Vice Chairs serve while qualified.
42 Section 6 of this bill requires the Joint Interim Standing Committees to begin
43 holding their meetings on September 1 after the adjournment of each regular
44 session, instead of November 1 under existing law. Section 6 provides that if a
45 regular member cannot attend a meeting of the Committee, an alternate member
46 must be of the same political party as the regular member, and section 6 clarifies
47 that, when acting in place of a regular member, an alternate member has all the
48 powers, privileges and immunities of a regular member.
49 Existing law requires that any recommended legislation proposed by a Joint
50 Interim Standing Committee must be approved by a majority of the members of the
51 Senate and a majority of the members of the Assembly serving on the Committee.
52 (NRS 218E.325) Section 6 changes the approval required to a vote in favor of such
53 legislation by at least five members of the eight-member Committee, regardless of
54 their House.
55 Existing law requires the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Legislative
56 Operations and Elections to evaluate and review issues relating to governmental
57 purchasing. (NRS 218E.330) Section 7 of this bill transfers such duties to the Joint
58 Interim Standing Committee on Government Affairs. Section 36 of this bill makes
59 a conforming change to require that the biennial report on recommendations for
60 legislation relating to governmental purchasing in existing law be submitted to the
61 Joint Interim Standing Committee on Government Affairs. (NRS 332.215)
-
*SB226*
– 3 –
62 Existing law creates the Subcommittee on Public Lands of the Joint Interim
63 Standing Committee on Natural Resources and prescribes the Subcommittee’s
64 powers and duties. (NRS 218E.500-218E.525, NRS 321.7355) Sections 8-10, 35
65 and 43 of this bill eliminate the Subcommittee and transfer its powers and duties to
66 the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Natural Resources and Public Lands,
67 which is renamed as such by section 5. Sections 1 and 40 of this bill make
68 conforming changes as a result of the renaming of this Committee. Section 9
69 requires the renamed Joint Interim Standing Committee on Natural Resources and
70 Public Lands to hold at least three meetings during each legislative interim where
71 the primary physical location of the meeting is located in a different county for
72 each such meeting other than Clark County, Washoe County or Carson City.
73 However, section 9 does not prohibit the use of authorized remote-technology
74 systems for each such meeting, including when necessary to connect the primary
75 physical location of the meeting to additional physical locations for the meeting in
76 Clark County, Washoe County or Carson City.
77 Existing law creates: (1) the Legislative Committee for the Review and
78 Oversight of the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency and the Marlette Lake Water
79 System; and (2) the Legislative Committee on Senior Citizens, Veterans and Adults
80 With Special Needs. (NRS 218E.550-218E.570, 218E.745-218E.760) Sections 11
81 and 12 of this bill revise the membership, organization and operations of these
82 Committees.
83 Existing law creates the Sunset Subcommittee of the Legislative Commission.
84 (NRS 232B.210-232B.250) Sections 26-32 and 43 of this bill: (1) make the Sunset
85 Subcommittee a stand-alone interim committee instead of a subcommittee of the
86 Legislative Commission and rename it as the Sunset Committee of the Legislature;
87 and (2) revise the membership, organization and operations of the Sunset
88 Committee.
89 Existing law authorizes Joint Interim Standing Committees and other interim
90 committees to request the drafting of a certain number of legislative measures for
91 each regular session. (NRS 218D.160) Section 1 revises the number of such
92 requests that the renamed Sunset Committee of the Legislature is authorized to
93 make.
94 Section 43 eliminates the requirement in existing law that the Joint Interim
95 Standing Committee on Health and Human Services review certain regulations that
96 are proposed or adopted by certain licensing boards and that are related to health
97 care. (NRS 439B.225) Sections 33 and 34 of this bill make conforming changes as
98 a result of the elimination of this requirement.
99 Existing law requires a teacher who wishes to serve on the Nevada State
100 Teacher and Education Support Professional Recruitment and Retention Advisory
101 Task Force to submit an application to the Joint Interim Standing Committee on
102 Education on or before January 15 of an even-numbered year. (NRS 391.494)
103 Section 38 of this bill moves the due date of the application to December 1 of an
104 odd-numbered year.
105 Existing law requires various reports, documents and other information to be
106 compiled by state or local governmental agencies or other entities and then reported
107 to certain legislative committees or staff. (NRS 193.309, 209.192, 209.461,
108 209.4818, 388.887, 449.242) Sections 22-25 and 37-39 of this bill revise those
109 reporting requirements.
110 Under existing law, the Nevada Lobbying Disclosure and Regulation Act
111 (Lobbying Act) prohibits, with certain exceptions, Legislators, legislative officers
112 and legislative staff members from knowingly or willfully soliciting or accepting
113 any gift from a lobbyist, whether or not the Legislature is in a regular or special
114 session. (NRS 218H.060, 218H.090, 218H.930) Under existing exceptions to the
115 gift prohibitions, if Legislators or members of their households receive anything of
116 value from a lobbyist to undertake or attend any educational or informational
-
*SB226*
– 4 –
117 meetings, events or trips, such meetings, events or trips are excluded from the term
118 “gift” under the Lobbying Act, but the Legislators are required to report the
119 educational or informational meetings, events or trips on their financial disclosure
120 statements under the Nevada Financial Disclosure Act (Financial Disclosure Act).
121 (NRS 218H.045, 218H.060, 281.5583, 281.571)
122 Sections 13-20 of this bill create exceptions for legislative committee
123 investigative meetings, events or trips. Section 15 defines a “legislative committee
124 investigative meeting, event or trip” to include any meetings, events or trips that the
125 chair of a legislative committee authorizes as official meetings, events or trips of
126 the committee in order for the members of the committee and legislative staff
127 members to investigate or otherwise receive any education or information on
128 matters that are pertinent to the committee’s legislative business or possible future
129 legislative action. Based on the exceptions in sections 17 and 19, such legislative
130 committee investigative meetings, events or trips are not required to be reported on
131 financial disclosure statements under the Financial Disclosure Act. (NRS 281.5583,
132 281.5585)
133 Sections 17 and 19 also make the existing exceptions for educational or
134 informational meetings, events or trips applicable to: (1) legislative officers, such as
135 the Secretary of the Senate and the Chief Clerk of the Assembly; and (2) legislative
136 staff members but only if such staff members have the approval of their chief
137 administrative supervisors to undertake or attend the educational or informational
138 meetings, events or trips. Because the Financial Disclosure Act applies to
139 legislative officers, such as the Secretary of the Senate and the Chief Clerk of the
140 Assembly, and to certain senior staff members of the Legislative Counsel Bureau,
141 such as the Director and the chiefs of the divisions, they are required to report the
142 educational or informational meetings, events or trips on financial disclosure
143 statements. By contrast, if rank-and-file legislative staff members have the approval
144 of their chief administrative supervisors to undertake or attend any educational or
145 informational meetings, events or trips, they are not required to report the
146 educational or informational meetings, events or trips on financial disclosure
147 statements, unless they qualify as a public officer or candidate or a member of a
148 public officer’s or candidate’s household for the purposes of the Financial
149 Disclosure Act. (NRS 281.005, 281.558, 281.5583, 281.5587)

– 11 –
1 1. Policies and issues relating to public lands and state
2 sovereignty as impaired by federal ownership of land are matters of
3 continuing concern to this State.
4 2. This concern necessarily includes an awareness that all
5 federal statutes, policies and regulations which affect the
6 management of public lands are likely to have extensive effects
7 within the State and must not be ignored or automatically dismissed
8 as beyond the reach of the state’s policymakers.
9 3. Experience with federal regulations relating to public lands
10 has demonstrated that the State of Nevada and its citizens are
11 subjected to regulations which sometimes are unreasonable,
12 arbitrary, beyond the intent of the Congress or the scope of the
13 authority of the agency adopting them and that as a result these
14 regulations should be subjected to legislative review and comment,
15 and judicially tested where appropriate, to protect the rights and
16 interests of the State and its citizens.
17 4. Other western states where public lands comprise a large
18 proportion of the total area have shown an interest in matters
19 relating to public lands and those states, along with Nevada, have
20 been actively participating in cooperative efforts to acquire, evaluate
21 and share information and promote greater understanding of the
22 issues. Since Nevada can both contribute to and benefit from such
23 interstate activities, it is appropriate that [a subcommittee on matters
24 relating to public lands] the Joint Interim Standing Committee on
25 Natural Resources and Public Lands be assigned primary
26 responsibility for participating in them.
27 Sec. 9. NRS 218E.520 is hereby amended to read as follows:
28 218E.520 1. [The Subcommittee] During each legislative
29 interim, the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Natural
30 Resources and Public Lands shall hold at least three meetings
31 where the primary physical location for the meeting is:
32 (a) Located in a different county for each such meeting; and
33 (b) Not located in Clark County, Washoe County or Carson
34 City for each such meeting,
35  except that this subsection does not prohibit any additional
36 physical locations for such a meeting from being located in Clark
37 County, Washoe County or Carson City and connected to the
38 primary physical location for the meeting through the use of any
39 authorized remote-technology system or otherwise prohibit the use
40 of any authorized remote-technology system for such a meeting.
41 As used in this subsection, “authorized remote-technology system”
42 has the meaning ascribed to it in NRS 218A.806.
43 2. In addition to any other powers or duties, the Committee
44 may:
-

24 reserved to the State pursuant to the Constitution of the United
25 States;
26 (g) Enter into a contract for consulting services for land
27 planning and any other related activities, including, but not limited
28 to:

S.B. 226
SENATE BILL NO. 226–COMMITTEE ON
LEGISLATIVE OPERATIONS AND ELECTIONS
(ON BEHALF OF THE JOINT INTERIM STANDING COMMITTEE
ON LEGISLATIVE OPERATIONS AND ELECTIONS)
FEBRUARY 19, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Legislative Operations and Elections
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to legislative affairs.
(BDR 17-365)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to legislative affairs; making various changes
relating to legislative interim committees and presiding
officers of those committees; revising the deadline to
submit an application to the Joint Interim Standing
Committee on Education to serve on the Nevada State
Teacher and Education Support Professional Recruitment
and Retention Advisory Task Force; eliminating the
requirement that the Joint Interim Standing Committee on
Health and Human Services review certain regulations;
making the Sunset Subcommittee of the Legislative
Commission a stand-alone interim committee; revising
provisions relating to legislative committee members and
staff regulated by the Nevada Lobbying Disclosure and
Regulation Act and Nevada Financial Disclosure Act;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes various legislative interim committees that are created
2 or authorized to conduct studies or investigations or perform other legislative
3 business during the interim between legislative sessions, and existing law provides
4 for the appointment or designation of chairs and vice chairs of such interim
5 committees. (Chapter 218E of NRS, NRS 232B.210-232B.250) Existing law also
6 contains provisions that apply exclusively to such interim committees without
7 applying to any session committees. (NRS 218E.105-218E.140)
-
*SB226*

8 Under existing common-law principles of parliamentary law, the chair of a
9 committee serves as the presiding officer of the committee and may take, direct or
10 require any necessary and reasonable actions to carry out the committee’s
11 management, government, budget, meetings and proceedings, subject to the laws
12 and rules governing the committee. In addition, if a vacancy occurs in the position
13 of chair, or if the chair is prohibited or disqualified from participating or acting on a
14 particular matter for any reason or is absent, disabled or otherwise unavailable or
15 unable to carry out the position for any reason, the vice chair of the committee
16 serves as the acting chair, with all the powers, privileges and immunities of the
17 position of chair, until the vacancy is filled or the chair is eligible, available or able
18 to carry out the position again, as applicable. (Mason’s Manual of Legislative
19 Procedure §§ 575-579, 608-611 (2020); Luther S. Cushing, Elements of the Law &
20 Practice of Legislative Assemblies §§ 287, 308, 313, 314, 1910 (1856); Hicks v.
21 Long Branch Comm’n, 55 A. 250, 250-51 (N.J. 1903)) To assist interim committees
22 in conducting their legislative business consistently with existing common-law
23 principles of parliamentary law, sections 2-4 of this bill codify those existing
24 common-law principles into the statutory provisions that apply to interim
25 committees. (Welfare Div. v. Maynard, 84 Nev. 525, 529 (1968) (“A statutory
26 enactment can be simply a legislative pronouncement of already existing law.”);
27 State Gaming Comm’n v. Southwest Sec., 108 Nev. 379, 383-84 (1992))
28 Existing law: (1) establishes Joint Interim Standing Committees of the
29 Legislature that are authorized to evaluate and review issues within the jurisdiction
30 of the corresponding standing committees from the preceding regular session of the
31 Legislature, exercise certain investigative powers and, under certain circumstances,
32 conduct studies directed by the Legislature or the Legislative Commission; (2)
33 provides for the appointment of regular members and alternate members to each
34 Joint Interim Standing Committee; and (3) requires the Legislative Commission to
35 select a Chair and a Vice Chair for each Joint Interim Standing Committee. (NRS
36 218E.320, 218E.330)
37 Section 5 of this bill requires the appointing authorities to appoint the
38 committee members for each Joint Interim Standing Committee, along with the
39 Chairs and Vice Chairs, not later than August 31 following the adjournment of each
40 regular session. Section 5 also clarifies the length of the terms that the committee
41 members and the Chairs and Vice Chairs serve while qualified.
42 Section 6 of this bill requires the Joint Interim Standing Committees to begin
43 holding their meetings on September 1 after the adjournment of each regular
44 session, instead of November 1 under existing law. Section 6 provides that if a
45 regular member cannot attend a meeting of the Committee, an alternate member
46 must be of the same political party as the regular member, and section 6 clarifies
47 that, when acting in place of a regular member, an alternate member has all the
48 powers, privileges and immunities of a regular member.
49 Existing law requires that any recommended legislation proposed by a Joint
50 Interim Standing Committee must be approved by a majority of the members of the
51 Senate and a majority of the members of the Assembly serving on the Committee.
52 (NRS 218E.325) Section 6 changes the approval required to a vote in favor of such
53 legislation by at least five members of the eight-member Committee, regardless of
54 their House.
55 Existing law requires the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Legislative
56 Operations and Elections to evaluate and review issues relating to governmental
57 purchasing. (NRS 218E.330) Section 7 of this bill transfers such duties to the Joint
58 Interim Standing Committee on Government Affairs. Section 36 of this bill makes
59 a conforming change to require that the biennial report on recommendations for
60 legislation relating to governmental purchasing in existing law be submitted to the
61 Joint Interim Standing Committee on Government Affairs. (NRS 332.215)
-
*SB226*

62 Existing law creates the Subcommittee on Public Lands of the Joint Interim
63 Standing Committee on Natural Resources and prescribes the Subcommittee’s
64 powers and duties. (NRS 218E.500-218E.525, NRS 321.7355) Sections 8-10, 35
65 and 43 of this bill eliminate the Subcommittee and transfer its powers and duties to
66 the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Natural Resources and Public Lands,
67 which is renamed as such by section 5. Sections 1 and 40 of this bill make
68 conforming changes as a result of the renaming of this Committee. Section 9
69 requires the renamed Joint Interim Standing Committee on Natural Resources and
70 Public Lands to hold at least three meetings during each legislative interim where
71 the primary physical location of the meeting is located in a different county for
72 each such meeting other than Clark County, Washoe County or Carson City.
73 However, section 9 does not prohibit the use of authorized remote-technology
74 systems for each such meeting, including when necessary to connect the primary
75 physical location of the meeting to additional physical locations for the meeting in
76 Clark County, Washoe County or Carson City.
77 Existing law creates: (1) the Legislative Committee for the Review and
78 Oversight of the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency and the Marlette Lake Water
79 System; and (2) the Legislative Committee on Senior Citizens, Veterans and Adults
80 With Special Needs. (NRS 218E.550-218E.570, 218E.745-218E.760) Sections 11
81 and 12 of this bill revise the membership, organization and operations of these
82 Committees.
83 Existing law creates the Sunset Subcommittee of the Legislative Commission.
84 (NRS 232B.210-232B.250) Sections 26-32 and 43 of this bill: (1) make the Sunset
85 Subcommittee a stand-alone interim committee instead of a subcommittee of the
86 Legislative Commission and rename it as the Sunset Committee of the Legislature;
87 and (2) revise the membership, organization and operations of the Sunset
88 Committee.
89 Existing law authorizes Joint Interim Standing Committees and other interim
90 committees to request the drafting of a certain number of legislative measures for
91 each regular session. (NRS 218D.160) Section 1 revises the number of such
92 requests that the renamed Sunset Committee of the Legislature is authorized to
93 make.
94 Section 43 eliminates the requirement in existing law that the Joint Interim
95 Standing Committee on Health and Human Services review certain regulations that
96 are proposed or adopted by certain licensing boards and that are related to health
97 care. (NRS 439B.225) Sections 33 and 34 of this bill make conforming changes as
98 a result of the elimination of this requirement.
99 Existing law requires a teacher who wishes to serve on the Nevada State
100 Teacher and Education Support Professional Recruitment and Retention Advisory
101 Task Force to submit an application to the Joint Interim Standing Committee on
102 Education on or before January 15 of an even-numbered year. (NRS 391.494)
103 Section 38 of this bill moves the due date of the application to December 1 of an
104 odd-numbered year.
105 Existing law requires various reports, documents and other information to be
106 compiled by state or local governmental agencies or other entities and then reported
107 to certain legislative committees or staff. (NRS 193.309, 209.192, 209.461,
108 209.4818, 388.887, 449.242) Sections 22-25 and 37-39 of this bill revise those
109 reporting requirements.
110 Under existing law, the Nevada Lobbying Disclosure and Regulation Act
111 (Lobbying Act) prohibits, with certain exceptions, Legislators, legislative officers
112 and legislative staff members from knowingly or willfully soliciting or accepting
113 any gift from a lobbyist, whether or not the Legislature is in a regular or special
114 session. (NRS 218H.060, 218H.090, 218H.930) Under existing exceptions to the
115 gift prohibitions, if Legislators or members of their households receive anything of
116 value from a lobbyist to undertake or attend any educational or informational
-
*SB226*

– 4 –
117 meetings, events or trips, such meetings, events or trips are excluded from the term
118 “gift” under the Lobbying Act, but the Legislators are required to report the
119 educational or informational meetings, events or trips on their financial disclosure
120 statements under the Nevada Financial Disclosure Act (Financial Disclosure Act).
121 (NRS 218H.045, 218H.060, 281.5583, 281.571)
122 Sections 13-20 of this bill create exceptions for legislative committee
123 investigative meetings, events or trips. Section 15 defines a “legislative committee
124 investigative meeting, event or trip” to include any meetings, events or trips that the
125 chair of a legislative committee authorizes as official meetings, events or trips of
126 the committee in order for the members of the committee and legislative staff
127 members to investigate or otherwise receive any education or information on
128 matters that are pertinent to the committee’s legislative business or possible future
129 legislative action. Based on the exceptions in sections 17 and 19, such legislative
130 committee investigative meetings, events or trips are not required to be reported on
131 financial disclosure statements under the Financial Disclosure Act. (NRS 281.5583,
132 281.5585)
133 Sections 17 and 19 also make the existing exceptions for educational or
134 informational meetings, events or trips applicable to: (1) legislative officers, such as
135 the Secretary of the Senate and the Chief Clerk of the Assembly; and (2) legislative
136 staff members but only if such staff members have the approval of their chief
137 administrative supervisors to undertake or attend the educational or informational
138 meetings, events or trips. Because the Financial Disclosure Act applies to
139 legislative officers, such as the Secretary of the Senate and the Chief Clerk of the
140 Assembly, and to certain senior staff members of the Legislative Counsel Bureau,
141 such as the Director and the chiefs of the divisions, they are required to report the
142 educational or informational meetings, events or trips on financial disclosure
143 statements. By contrast, if rank-and-file legislative staff members have the approval
144 of their chief administrative supervisors to undertake or attend any educational or
145 informational meetings, events or trips, they are not required to report the
146 educational or informational meetings, events or trips on financial disclosure
147 statements, unless they qualify as a public officer or candidate or a member of a
148 public officer’s or candidate’s household for the purposes of the Financial
149 Disclosure Act. (NRS 281.005, 281.558, 281.5583, 281.5587)

44 218E.500 The Legislature finds and declares that:
-
*SB226*

– 11 –
1 1. Policies and issues relating to public lands and state
2 sovereignty as impaired by federal ownership of land are matters of
3 continuing concern to this State.
4 2. This concern necessarily includes an awareness that all
5 federal statutes, policies and regulations which affect the
6 management of public lands are likely to have extensive effects
7 within the State and must not be ignored or automatically dismissed
8 as beyond the reach of the state’s policymakers.
9 3. Experience with federal regulations relating to public lands
10 has demonstrated that the State of Nevada and its citizens are
11 subjected to regulations which sometimes are unreasonable,
12 arbitrary, beyond the intent of the Congress or the scope of the
13 authority of the agency adopting them and that as a result these
14 regulations should be subjected to legislative review and comment,
15 and judicially tested where appropriate, to protect the rights and
16 interests of the State and its citizens.
17 4. Other western states where public lands comprise a large
18 proportion of the total area have shown an interest in matters
19 relating to public lands and those states, along with Nevada, have
20 been actively participating in cooperative efforts to acquire, evaluate
21 and share information and promote greater understanding of the
22 issues. Since Nevada can both contribute to and benefit from such
23 interstate activities, it is appropriate that [a subcommittee on matters
24 relating to public lands] the Joint Interim Standing Committee on
25 Natural Resources and Public Lands be assigned primary
26 responsibility for participating in them.
27 Sec. 9. NRS 218E.520 is hereby amended to read as follows:
28 218E.520 1. [The Subcommittee] During each legislative
29 interim, the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Natural
30 Resources and Public Lands shall hold at least three meetings
31 where the primary physical location for the meeting is:
32 (a) Located in a different county for each such meeting; and
33 (b) Not located in Clark County, Washoe County or Carson
34 City for each such meeting,
35  except that this subsection does not prohibit any additional
36 physical locations for such a meeting from being located in Clark
37 County, Washoe County or Carson City and connected to the
38 primary physical location for the meeting through the use of any
39 authorized remote-technology system or otherwise prohibit the use
40 of any authorized remote-technology system for such a meeting.
41 As used in this subsection, “authorized remote-technology system”
42 has the meaning ascribed to it in NRS 218A.806.
43 2. In addition to any other powers or duties, the Committee
44 may:
-
*SB226*

– 12 –
1 (a) Review and comment on any administrative policy, rule or
2 regulation of the:
3 (1) Secretary of the Interior which pertains to policy
4 concerning or management of public lands under the control of the
5 Federal Government; and
6 (2) Secretary of Agriculture which pertains to policy
7 concerning or management of national forests;
8 (b) Conduct investigations and hold hearings in connection with
9 its review, including, but not limited to, investigating the effect on
10 the State, its citizens, political subdivisions, businesses and
11 industries of those policies, rules, regulations and related laws, and
12 exercise any of the investigative powers set forth in NRS 218E.105
13 to 218E.140, inclusive;
14 (c) Consult with and advise the State Land Use Planning
15 Agency on matters concerning federal land use, policies and
16 activities in this State;
17 (d) Direct the Legislative Counsel Bureau to assist in its
18 research, investigations, review and comment;
19 (e) Recommend to the Legislature as a result of its review any
20 appropriate state legislation or corrective federal legislation;
21 (f) Advise the Attorney General if it believes that any federal
22 policy, rule or regulation which it has reviewed encroaches on the
23 sovereignty respecting land or water or their use which has been
24 reserved to the State pursuant to the Constitution of the United
25 States;
26 (g) Enter into a contract for consulting services for land
27 planning and any other related activities, including, but not limited
28 to:
29 (1) Advising the [Subcommittee] Committee and the State
30 Land Use Planning Agency concerning the revision of the plans
31 pursuant to NRS 321.7355;
32 (2) Assisting local governments in the identification of lands
33 administered by the Federal Government in this State which are
34 needed for residential or economic development or any other
35 purpose; and
36 (3) Assisting local governments in the acquisition of federal
37 lands in this State;
38 (h) Apply for any available grants and accept any gifts, grants or
39 donations to assist the [Subcommittee] Committee in carrying out
40 its duties; and
41 (i) Review and comment on any other matter relating to the
42 preservation, conservation, use, management or disposal of public
43 lands deemed appropriate by the Chair of the [Subcommittee]
44 Committee or by a majority of the members of the [Subcommittee.]
