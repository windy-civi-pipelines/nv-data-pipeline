Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes various legislative interim committees that are created or
2 authorized to conduct studies or investigations or perform other legislative business during the
3 interim between legislative sessions, and existing law provides for the appointment or
4 designation of chairs and vice chairs of such interim committees. (Chapter 218E of NRS, NRS
5 232B.210-232B.250) Existing law also contains provisions that apply exclusively to such
6 interim committees without applying to any session committees. (NRS 218E.105-218E.140)
7 Under existing common-law principles of parliamentary law, the chair of a committee
8 serves as the presiding officer of the committee and may take, direct or require any necessary
9 and reasonable actions to carry out the committee’s management, government, budget,
10 meetings and proceedings, subject to the laws and rules governing the committee. In addition,
Assembly Amendment No. 927 to Senate Bill No. 226 First Reprint Page 4
11 if a vacancy occurs in the position of chair, or if the chair is prohibited or disqualified from
12 participating or acting on a particular matter for any reason or is absent, disabled or otherwise
13 unavailable or unable to carry out the position for any reason, the vice chair of the committee
14 serves as the acting chair, with all the powers, privileges and immunities of the position of
15 chair, until the vacancy is filled or the chair is eligible, available or able to carry out the
16 position again, as applicable. (Mason’s Manual of Legislative Procedure §§ 575-579, 608-611
17 (2020); Luther S. Cushing, Elements of the Law & Practice of Legislative Assemblies §§ 287,
18 308, 313, 314, 1910 (1856); Hicks v. Long Branch Comm’n, 55 A. 250, 250-51 (N.J. 1903))
19 To assist interim committees in conducting their legislative business consistently with existing
20 common-law principles of parliamentary law, sections 2-4 of this bill codify those existing
21 common-law principles into the statutory provisions that apply to interim committees.
22 (Welfare Div. v. Maynard, 84 Nev. 525, 529 (1968) (“A statutory enactment can be simply a
23 legislative pronouncement of already existing law.”); State Gaming Comm’n v. Southwest
24 Sec., 108 Nev. 379, 383-84 (1992))
25 Existing law: (1) establishes Joint Interim Standing Committees of the Legislature that
26 are authorized to evaluate and review issues within the jurisdiction of the corresponding
27 standing committees from the preceding regular session of the Legislature, exercise certain
28 investigative powers and, under certain circumstances, conduct studies directed by the
29 Legislature or the Legislative Commission; (2) provides for the appointment of regular
30 members and alternate members to each Joint Interim Standing Committee; and (3) requires
31 the Legislative Commission to select a Chair and a Vice Chair for each Joint Interim Standing
32 Committee. (NRS 218E.320, 218E.330)
33 Section 5 of this bill requires the appointing authorities to appoint the committee
34 members for each Joint Interim Standing Committee, along with the Chairs and Vice Chairs,
35 not later than October 31 following the adjournment of each regular session. Section 5 also
36 clarifies the length of the terms that the committee members and the Chairs and Vice Chairs
37 serve while qualified.
38 Section 6 of this bill provides that if a regular member cannot attend a meeting of the
39 Committee, an alternate member must be of the same political party as the regular member,
40 and section 6 clarifies that, when acting in place of a regular member, an alternate member
41 has all the powers, privileges and immunities of a regular member.
42 Existing law requires the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Legislative Operations
43 and Elections to evaluate and review issues relating to governmental purchasing. (NRS
44 218E.330) Section 7 of this bill transfers such duties to the Joint Interim Standing Committee
45 on Government Affairs. Section 36 of this bill makes a conforming change to require that the
46 biennial report on recommendations for legislation relating to governmental purchasing in
47 existing law be submitted to the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Government Affairs.
48 (NRS 332.215)
49 Existing law creates the Subcommittee on Public Lands of the Joint Interim Standing
50 Committee on Natural Resources and prescribes the Subcommittee’s powers and duties. (NRS
51 218E.500-218E.525, NRS 321.7355) Sections 8-10 and 35 of this bill: (1) make the
52 Subcommittee a stand-alone interim committee instead of a subcommittee of the Joint Interim
53 Standing Committee on Natural Resources and rename it as the Committee on Public Lands;
54 and (2) revise the membership, organization and operations of the Committee on Public
55 Lands. Section 1 of this bill authorizes the Committee on Public Lands to request 4 legislative
56 measures and eliminates the authority of the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Natural
57 Resources to request 4 additional legislative measures based on the recommendations for
58 legislation submitted by the former Subcommittee on Public Lands. Section 9 requires the
59 Committee on Public Lands to hold at least three meetings during each legislative interim
60 where the primary physical location of the meeting is located in a different county for each
61 such meeting other than Clark County, Washoe County or Carson City. However, section 9
62 does not prohibit the use of authorized remote-technology systems for each such meeting,
63 including when necessary to connect the primary physical location of the meeting to
64 additional physical locations for the meeting in Clark County, Washoe County or Carson City.
65 Existing law creates: (1) the Legislative Committee for the Review and Oversight of the
66 Tahoe Regional Planning Agency and the Marlette Lake Water System; and (2) the
67 Legislative Committee on Senior Citizens, Veterans and Adults With Special Needs. (NRS
68 218E.550-218E.570, 218E.745-218E.760) Sections 11 and 12 of this bill revise the
69 membership, organization and operations of these Committees.
Assembly Amendment No. 927 to Senate Bill No. 226 First Reprint Page 5
70 Existing law creates the Sunset Subcommittee of the Legislative Commission. (NRS
71 232B.210-232B.250) Sections 26-32 and 43 of this bill: (1) make the Sunset Subcommittee a
72 stand-alone interim committee instead of a subcommittee of the Legislative Commission and
73 rename it as the Sunset Committee of the Legislature; and (2) revise the membership,
74 organization and operations of the Sunset Committee.
75 Existing law authorizes Joint Interim Standing Committees and other interim committees
76 to request the drafting of a certain number of legislative measures for each regular session.
77 (NRS 218D.160) Section 1 revises the number of such requests that the renamed Sunset
78 Committee of the Legislature is authorized to make.
79 Section 43 eliminates the requirement in existing law that the Joint Interim Standing
80 Committee on Health and Human Services review certain regulations that are proposed or
81 adopted by certain licensing boards and that are related to health care. (NRS 439B.225)
82 Sections 33 and 34 of this bill make conforming changes as a result of the elimination of this
83 requirement.
84 Existing law requires a teacher who wishes to serve on the Nevada State Teacher and
85 Education Support Professional Recruitment and Retention Advisory Task Force to submit an
86 application to the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Education on or before January 15 of
87 an even-numbered year. (NRS 391.494) Section 38 of this bill moves the due date of the
88 application to December 1 of an odd-numbered year.
89 Existing law requires various reports, documents and other information to be compiled by
90 state or local governmental agencies or other entities and then reported to certain legislative
91 committees or staff. (NRS 193.309, 209.192, 209.461, 209.4818, 388.887, 449.242) Sections
92 22-25 and 37-39 of this bill revise those reporting requirements.
93 Under existing law, the Nevada Lobbying Disclosure and Regulation Act (Lobbying Act)
94 prohibits, with certain exceptions, Legislators, legislative officers and legislative staff
95 members from knowingly or willfully soliciting or accepting any gift from a lobbyist, whether
96 or not the Legislature is in a regular or special session. (NRS 218H.060, 218H.090, 218H.930)
97 Under existing exceptions to the gift prohibitions, if Legislators or members of their
98 households receive anything of value from a lobbyist to undertake or attend any educational or
99 informational meetings, events or trips, such meetings, events or trips are excluded from the
100 term “gift” under the Lobbying Act, but the Legislators are required to report the educational
101 or informational meetings, events or trips on their financial disclosure statements under the
102 Nevada Financial Disclosure Act (Financial Disclosure Act). (NRS 218H.045, 218H.060,
103 281.5583, 281.571)
104 Sections 13-20 of this bill create exceptions for legislative committee investigative
105 meetings, events or trips. Section 15 defines a “legislative committee investigative meeting,
106 event or trip” to include any meetings, events or trips that the chair of a legislative committee
107 authorizes as official meetings, events or trips of the committee in order for the members of
108 the committee and legislative staff members to investigate or otherwise receive any education
109 or information on matters that are pertinent to the committee’s legislative business or possible
110 future legislative action. Based on the exceptions in sections 17 and 19, such legislative
111 committee investigative meetings, events or trips are not required to be reported on financial
112 disclosure statements under the Financial Disclosure Act. (NRS 281.5583, 281.5585)
113 Sections 17 and 19 also make the existing exceptions for educational or informational
114 meetings, events or trips applicable to: (1) legislative officers, such as the Secretary of the
115 Senate and the Chief Clerk of the Assembly; and (2) legislative staff members but only if such
116 staff members have the approval of their chief administrative supervisors to undertake or
117 attend the educational or informational meetings, events or trips. Because the Financial
118 Disclosure Act applies to legislative officers, such as the Secretary of the Senate and the Chief
119 Clerk of the Assembly, and to certain senior staff members of the Legislative Counsel Bureau,
120 such as the Director and the chiefs of the divisions, they are required to report the educational
121 or informational meetings, events or trips on financial disclosure statements. By contrast, if
122 rank-and-file legislative staff members have the approval of their chief administrative
123 supervisors to undertake or attend any educational or informational meetings, events or trips,
124 they are not required to report the educational or informational meetings, events or trips on
125 financial disclosure statements, unless they qualify as a public officer or candidate or a
126 member of a public officer’s or candidate’s household for the purposes of the Financial
127 Disclosure Act. (NRS 281.005, 281.558, 281.5583, 281.5587)
Assembly Amendment No. 927 to Senate Bill No. 226 First Reprint Page 6
128 Existing law creates the Mining Oversight and Accountability Commission and
129 requires the Commission to provide oversight of compliance with Nevada law relating to
130 the activities of each state agency, board, bureau, commission, department or division
131 with respect to the taxation, operation, safety and environmental regulation of mines and
132 mining in this State. (NRS 514A.040, 514A.060) Section 40.5 of this bill provides that if
133 the Commission fails to review certain regulations relating to mines or mining within 90
134 days after adoption, the regulations will become effective if approved in accordance with
135 the applicable provisions of the Nevada Administrative Procedure Act.

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes various legislative interim committees that are created or
2 authorized to conduct studies or investigations or perform other legislative business during the
3 interim between legislative sessions, and existing law provides for the appointment or
4 designation of chairs and vice chairs of such interim committees. (Chapter 218E of NRS, NRS
5 232B.210-232B.250) Existing law also contains provisions that apply exclusively to such
6 interim committees without applying to any session committees. (NRS 218E.105-218E.140)
7 Under existing common-law principles of parliamentary law, the chair of a committee
8 serves as the presiding officer of the committee and may take, direct or require any necessary
9 and reasonable actions to carry out the committee’s management, government, budget,
10 meetings and proceedings, subject to the laws and rules governing the committee. In addition,

Assembly Amendment No. 927 to Senate Bill No. 226 First Reprint Page 4
11 if a vacancy occurs in the position of chair, or if the chair is prohibited or disqualified from
12 participating or acting on a particular matter for any reason or is absent, disabled or otherwise
13 unavailable or unable to carry out the position for any reason, the vice chair of the committee
14 serves as the acting chair, with all the powers, privileges and immunities of the position of
15 chair, until the vacancy is filled or the chair is eligible, available or able to carry out the
16 position again, as applicable. (Mason’s Manual of Legislative Procedure §§ 575-579, 608-611
17 (2020); Luther S. Cushing, Elements of the Law & Practice of Legislative Assemblies §§ 287,
18 308, 313, 314, 1910 (1856); Hicks v. Long Branch Comm’n, 55 A. 250, 250-51 (N.J. 1903))
19 To assist interim committees in conducting their legislative business consistently with existing
20 common-law principles of parliamentary law, sections 2-4 of this bill codify those existing
21 common-law principles into the statutory provisions that apply to interim committees.
22 (Welfare Div. v. Maynard, 84 Nev. 525, 529 (1968) (“A statutory enactment can be simply a
23 legislative pronouncement of already existing law.”); State Gaming Comm’n v. Southwest
24 Sec., 108 Nev. 379, 383-84 (1992))
25 Existing law: (1) establishes Joint Interim Standing Committees of the Legislature that
26 are authorized to evaluate and review issues within the jurisdiction of the corresponding
27 standing committees from the preceding regular session of the Legislature, exercise certain
28 investigative powers and, under certain circumstances, conduct studies directed by the
29 Legislature or the Legislative Commission; (2) provides for the appointment of regular
30 members and alternate members to each Joint Interim Standing Committee; and (3) requires
31 the Legislative Commission to select a Chair and a Vice Chair for each Joint Interim Standing
32 Committee. (NRS 218E.320, 218E.330)
33 Section 5 of this bill requires the appointing authorities to appoint the committee
34 members for each Joint Interim Standing Committee, along with the Chairs and Vice Chairs,
35 not later than October 31 following the adjournment of each regular session. Section 5 also
36 clarifies the length of the terms that the committee members and the Chairs and Vice Chairs
37 serve while qualified.
38 Section 6 of this bill provides that if a regular member cannot attend a meeting of the
39 Committee, an alternate member must be of the same political party as the regular member,
40 and section 6 clarifies that, when acting in place of a regular member, an alternate member
41 has all the powers, privileges and immunities of a regular member.
42 Existing law requires the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Legislative Operations
43 and Elections to evaluate and review issues relating to governmental purchasing. (NRS
44 218E.330) Section 7 of this bill transfers such duties to the Joint Interim Standing Committee
45 on Government Affairs. Section 36 of this bill makes a conforming change to require that the
46 biennial report on recommendations for legislation relating to governmental purchasing in
47 existing law be submitted to the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Government Affairs.
48 (NRS 332.215)
49 Existing law creates the Subcommittee on Public Lands of the Joint Interim Standing
50 Committee on Natural Resources and prescribes the Subcommittee’s powers and duties. (NRS
51 218E.500-218E.525, NRS 321.7355) Sections 8-10 and 35 of this bill: (1) make the
52 Subcommittee a stand-alone interim committee instead of a subcommittee of the Joint Interim
53 Standing Committee on Natural Resources and rename it as the Committee on Public Lands;
54 and (2) revise the membership, organization and operations of the Committee on Public
55 Lands. Section 1 of this bill authorizes the Committee on Public Lands to request 4 legislative
56 measures and eliminates the authority of the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Natural
57 Resources to request 4 additional legislative measures based on the recommendations for
58 legislation submitted by the former Subcommittee on Public Lands. Section 9 requires the
59 Committee on Public Lands to hold at least three meetings during each legislative interim
60 where the primary physical location of the meeting is located in a different county for each
61 such meeting other than Clark County, Washoe County or Carson City. However, section 9
62 does not prohibit the use of authorized remote-technology systems for each such meeting,
63 including when necessary to connect the primary physical location of the meeting to
64 additional physical locations for the meeting in Clark County, Washoe County or Carson City.
65 Existing law creates: (1) the Legislative Committee for the Review and Oversight of the
66 Tahoe Regional Planning Agency and the Marlette Lake Water System; and (2) the
67 Legislative Committee on Senior Citizens, Veterans and Adults With Special Needs. (NRS
68 218E.550-218E.570, 218E.745-218E.760) Sections 11 and 12 of this bill revise the
69 membership, organization and operations of these Committees.

Assembly Amendment No. 927 to Senate Bill No. 226 First Reprint Page 5
70 Existing law creates the Sunset Subcommittee of the Legislative Commission. (NRS
71 232B.210-232B.250) Sections 26-32 and 43 of this bill: (1) make the Sunset Subcommittee a
72 stand-alone interim committee instead of a subcommittee of the Legislative Commission and
73 rename it as the Sunset Committee of the Legislature; and (2) revise the membership,
74 organization and operations of the Sunset Committee.
75 Existing law authorizes Joint Interim Standing Committees and other interim committees
76 to request the drafting of a certain number of legislative measures for each regular session.
77 (NRS 218D.160) Section 1 revises the number of such requests that the renamed Sunset
78 Committee of the Legislature is authorized to make.
79 Section 43 eliminates the requirement in existing law that the Joint Interim Standing
80 Committee on Health and Human Services review certain regulations that are proposed or
81 adopted by certain licensing boards and that are related to health care. (NRS 439B.225)
82 Sections 33 and 34 of this bill make conforming changes as a result of the elimination of this
83 requirement.
84 Existing law requires a teacher who wishes to serve on the Nevada State Teacher and
85 Education Support Professional Recruitment and Retention Advisory Task Force to submit an
86 application to the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Education on or before January 15 of
87 an even-numbered year. (NRS 391.494) Section 38 of this bill moves the due date of the
88 application to December 1 of an odd-numbered year.
89 Existing law requires various reports, documents and other information to be compiled by
90 state or local governmental agencies or other entities and then reported to certain legislative
91 committees or staff. (NRS 193.309, 209.192, 209.461, 209.4818, 388.887, 449.242) Sections
92 22-25 and 37-39 of this bill revise those reporting requirements.
93 Under existing law, the Nevada Lobbying Disclosure and Regulation Act (Lobbying Act)
94 prohibits, with certain exceptions, Legislators, legislative officers and legislative staff
95 members from knowingly or willfully soliciting or accepting any gift from a lobbyist, whether
96 or not the Legislature is in a regular or special session. (NRS 218H.060, 218H.090, 218H.930)
97 Under existing exceptions to the gift prohibitions, if Legislators or members of their
98 households receive anything of value from a lobbyist to undertake or attend any educational or
99 informational meetings, events or trips, such meetings, events or trips are excluded from the
100 term “gift” under the Lobbying Act, but the Legislators are required to report the educational
101 or informational meetings, events or trips on their financial disclosure statements under the
102 Nevada Financial Disclosure Act (Financial Disclosure Act). (NRS 218H.045, 218H.060,
103 281.5583, 281.571)
104 Sections 13-20 of this bill create exceptions for legislative committee investigative
105 meetings, events or trips. Section 15 defines a “legislative committee investigative meeting,
106 event or trip” to include any meetings, events or trips that the chair of a legislative committee
107 authorizes as official meetings, events or trips of the committee in order for the members of
108 the committee and legislative staff members to investigate or otherwise receive any education
109 or information on matters that are pertinent to the committee’s legislative business or possible
110 future legislative action. Based on the exceptions in sections 17 and 19, such legislative
111 committee investigative meetings, events or trips are not required to be reported on financial
112 disclosure statements under the Financial Disclosure Act. (NRS 281.5583, 281.5585)
113 Sections 17 and 19 also make the existing exceptions for educational or informational
114 meetings, events or trips applicable to: (1) legislative officers, such as the Secretary of the
115 Senate and the Chief Clerk of the Assembly; and (2) legislative staff members but only if such
116 staff members have the approval of their chief administrative supervisors to undertake or
117 attend the educational or informational meetings, events or trips. Because the Financial
118 Disclosure Act applies to legislative officers, such as the Secretary of the Senate and the Chief
119 Clerk of the Assembly, and to certain senior staff members of the Legislative Counsel Bureau,
120 such as the Director and the chiefs of the divisions, they are required to report the educational
121 or informational meetings, events or trips on financial disclosure statements. By contrast, if
122 rank-and-file legislative staff members have the approval of their chief administrative
123 supervisors to undertake or attend any educational or informational meetings, events or trips,
124 they are not required to report the educational or informational meetings, events or trips on
125 financial disclosure statements, unless they qualify as a public officer or candidate or a
126 member of a public officer’s or candidate’s household for the purposes of the Financial
127 Disclosure Act. (NRS 281.005, 281.558, 281.5583, 281.5587)

Assembly Amendment No. 927 to Senate Bill No. 226 First Reprint Page 6
128 Existing law creates the Mining Oversight and Accountability Commission and
129 requires the Commission to provide oversight of compliance with Nevada law relating to
130 the activities of each state agency, board, bureau, commission, department or division
131 with respect to the taxation, operation, safety and environmental regulation of mines and
132 mining in this State. (NRS 514A.040, 514A.060) Section 40.5 of this bill provides that if
133 the Commission fails to review certain regulations relating to mines or mining within 90
134 days after adoption, the regulations will become effective if approved in accordance with
135 the applicable provisions of the Nevada Administrative Procedure Act.

43 218E.500 The Legislature finds and declares that:
44 1. Policies and issues relating to public lands and state sovereignty as
45 impaired by federal ownership of land are matters of continuing concern to this
46 State.
47 2. This concern necessarily includes an awareness that all federal statutes,
48 policies and regulations which affect the management of public lands are likely to
49 have extensive effects within the State and must not be ignored or automatically
50 dismissed as beyond the reach of the state’s policymakers.
51 3. Experience with federal regulations relating to public lands has
52 demonstrated that the State of Nevada and its citizens are subjected to regulations
53 which sometimes are unreasonable, arbitrary, beyond the intent of the Congress or
