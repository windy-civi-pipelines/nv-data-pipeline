Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes various legislative interim committees that are created or
2 authorized to conduct studies or investigations or perform other legislative business during the
3 interim between legislative sessions, and existing law provides for the appointment or
4 designation of chairs and vice chairs of such interim committees. (Chapter 218E of NRS, NRS
5 232B.210-232B.250) Existing law also contains provisions that apply exclusively to such
6 interim committees without applying to any session committees. (NRS 218E.105-218E.140)
7 Under existing common-law principles of parliamentary law, the chair of a committee
8 serves as the presiding officer of the committee and may take, direct or require any necessary
9 and reasonable actions to carry out the committee’s management, government, budget,
10 meetings and proceedings, subject to the laws and rules governing the committee. In addition,
11 if a vacancy occurs in the position of chair, or if the chair is prohibited or disqualified from
12 participating or acting on a particular matter for any reason or is absent, disabled or otherwise

Senate Amendment No. 769 to Senate Bill No. 226 Page 4
13 unavailable or unable to carry out the position for any reason, the vice chair of the committee
14 serves as the acting chair, with all the powers, privileges and immunities of the position of
15 chair, until the vacancy is filled or the chair is eligible, available or able to carry out the
16 position again, as applicable. (Mason’s Manual of Legislative Procedure §§ 575-579, 608-611
17 (2020); Luther S. Cushing, Elements of the Law & Practice of Legislative Assemblies §§ 287,
18 308, 313, 314, 1910 (1856); Hicks v. Long Branch Comm’n, 55 A. 250, 250-51 (N.J. 1903))
19 To assist interim committees in conducting their legislative business consistently with existing
20 common-law principles of parliamentary law, sections 2-4 of this bill codify those existing
21 common-law principles into the statutory provisions that apply to interim committees.
22 (Welfare Div. v. Maynard, 84 Nev. 525, 529 (1968) (“A statutory enactment can be simply a
23 legislative pronouncement of already existing law.”); State Gaming Comm’n v. Southwest
24 Sec., 108 Nev. 379, 383-84 (1992))
25 Existing law: (1) establishes Joint Interim Standing Committees of the Legislature that
26 are authorized to evaluate and review issues within the jurisdiction of the corresponding
27 standing committees from the preceding regular session of the Legislature, exercise certain
28 investigative powers and, under certain circumstances, conduct studies directed by the
29 Legislature or the Legislative Commission; (2) provides for the appointment of regular
30 members and alternate members to each Joint Interim Standing Committee; and (3) requires
31 the Legislative Commission to select a Chair and a Vice Chair for each Joint Interim Standing
32 Committee. (NRS 218E.320, 218E.330)
33 Section 5 of this bill requires the appointing authorities to appoint the committee
34 members for each Joint Interim Standing Committee, along with the Chairs and Vice Chairs,
35 not later than [August] October 31 following the adjournment of each regular session.
36 Section 5 also clarifies the length of the terms that the committee members and the Chairs and
37 Vice Chairs serve while qualified.
38 Section 6 of this bill [requires the Joint Interim Standing Committees to begin holding
39 their meetings on September 1 after the adjournment of each regular session, instead of
40 November 1 under existing law. Section 6] provides that if a regular member cannot attend a
41 meeting of the Committee, an alternate member must be of the same political party as the
42 regular member, and section 6 clarifies that, when acting in place of a regular member, an
43 alternate member has all the powers, privileges and immunities of a regular member.
44 [Existing law requires that any recommended legislation proposed by a Joint Interim
45 Standing Committee must be approved by a majority of the members of the Senate and a
46 majority of the members of the Assembly serving on the Committee. (NRS 218E.325) Section
47 6 changes the approval required to a vote in favor of such legislation by at least five members
48 of the eight-member Committee, regardless of their House.]
49 Existing law requires the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Legislative Operations
50 and Elections to evaluate and review issues relating to governmental purchasing. (NRS
51 218E.330) Section 7 of this bill transfers such duties to the Joint Interim Standing Committee
52 on Government Affairs. Section 36 of this bill makes a conforming change to require that the
53 biennial report on recommendations for legislation relating to governmental purchasing in
54 existing law be submitted to the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Government Affairs.
55 (NRS 332.215)
56 Existing law creates the Subcommittee on Public Lands of the Joint Interim Standing
57 Committee on Natural Resources and prescribes the Subcommittee’s powers and duties. (NRS
58 218E.500-218E.525, NRS 321.7355) Sections 8-10 [,] and 35 [and 43] of this bill [eliminate]
59 : (1) make the Subcommittee a stand-alone interim committee instead of a subcommittee
60 of the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Natural Resources and rename it as the
61 Committee on Public Lands; and [transfer its powers and duties to] (2) revise the
62 membership, organization and operations of the [Joint Interim Standing] Committee on
63 [Natural Resources and] Public Lands . [, which is renamed as such by section 5. Sections]
64 Section 1 [and 40] of this bill [make conforming changes as a result of] authorizes the
65 [renaming of this] Committee [.] on Public Lands to request 4 legislative measures and
66 eliminates the authority of the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Natural Resources
67 to request 4 additional legislative measures based on the recommendations for legislation
68 submitted by the former Subcommittee on Public Lands. Section 9 requires the [renamed
69 Joint Interim Standing] Committee on [Natural Resources and] Public Lands to hold at least
70 three meetings during each legislative interim where the primary physical location of the
71 meeting is located in a different county for each such meeting other than Clark County,

Senate Amendment No. 769 to Senate Bill No. 226 Page 5
72 Washoe County or Carson City. However, section 9 does not prohibit the use of authorized
73 remote-technology systems for each such meeting, including when necessary to connect the
74 primary physical location of the meeting to additional physical locations for the meeting in
75 Clark County, Washoe County or Carson City.
76 Existing law creates: (1) the Legislative Committee for the Review and Oversight of the
77 Tahoe Regional Planning Agency and the Marlette Lake Water System; and (2) the
78 Legislative Committee on Senior Citizens, Veterans and Adults With Special Needs. (NRS
79 218E.550-218E.570, 218E.745-218E.760) Sections 11 and 12 of this bill revise the
80 membership, organization and operations of these Committees.
81 Existing law creates the Sunset Subcommittee of the Legislative Commission. (NRS
82 232B.210-232B.250) Sections 26-32 and 43 of this bill: (1) make the Sunset Subcommittee a
83 stand-alone interim committee instead of a subcommittee of the Legislative Commission and
84 rename it as the Sunset Committee of the Legislature; and (2) revise the membership,
85 organization and operations of the Sunset Committee.
86 Existing law authorizes Joint Interim Standing Committees and other interim committees
87 to request the drafting of a certain number of legislative measures for each regular session.
88 (NRS 218D.160) Section 1 revises the number of such requests that the renamed Sunset
89 Committee of the Legislature is authorized to make.
90 Section 43 eliminates the requirement in existing law that the Joint Interim Standing
91 Committee on Health and Human Services review certain regulations that are proposed or
92 adopted by certain licensing boards and that are related to health care. (NRS 439B.225)
93 Sections 33 and 34 of this bill make conforming changes as a result of the elimination of this
94 requirement.
95 Existing law requires a teacher who wishes to serve on the Nevada State Teacher and
96 Education Support Professional Recruitment and Retention Advisory Task Force to submit an
97 application to the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Education on or before January 15 of
98 an even-numbered year. (NRS 391.494) Section 38 of this bill moves the due date of the
99 application to December 1 of an odd-numbered year.
100 Existing law requires various reports, documents and other information to be compiled by
101 state or local governmental agencies or other entities and then reported to certain legislative
102 committees or staff. (NRS 193.309, 209.192, 209.461, 209.4818, 388.887, 449.242) Sections
103 22-25 and 37-39 of this bill revise those reporting requirements.
104 Under existing law, the Nevada Lobbying Disclosure and Regulation Act (Lobbying Act)
105 prohibits, with certain exceptions, Legislators, legislative officers and legislative staff
106 members from knowingly or willfully soliciting or accepting any gift from a lobbyist, whether
107 or not the Legislature is in a regular or special session. (NRS 218H.060, 218H.090, 218H.930)
108 Under existing exceptions to the gift prohibitions, if Legislators or members of their
109 households receive anything of value from a lobbyist to undertake or attend any educational or
110 informational meetings, events or trips, such meetings, events or trips are excluded from the
111 term “gift” under the Lobbying Act, but the Legislators are required to report the educational
112 or informational meetings, events or trips on their financial disclosure statements under the
113 Nevada Financial Disclosure Act (Financial Disclosure Act). (NRS 218H.045, 218H.060,
114 281.5583, 281.571)
115 Sections 13-20 of this bill create exceptions for legislative committee investigative
116 meetings, events or trips. Section 15 defines a “legislative committee investigative meeting,
117 event or trip” to include any meetings, events or trips that the chair of a legislative committee
118 authorizes as official meetings, events or trips of the committee in order for the members of
119 the committee and legislative staff members to investigate or otherwise receive any education
120 or information on matters that are pertinent to the committee’s legislative business or possible
121 future legislative action. Based on the exceptions in sections 17 and 19, such legislative
122 committee investigative meetings, events or trips are not required to be reported on financial
123 disclosure statements under the Financial Disclosure Act. (NRS 281.5583, 281.5585)
124 Sections 17 and 19 also make the existing exceptions for educational or informational
125 meetings, events or trips applicable to: (1) legislative officers, such as the Secretary of the
126 Senate and the Chief Clerk of the Assembly; and (2) legislative staff members but only if such
127 staff members have the approval of their chief administrative supervisors to undertake or
128 attend the educational or informational meetings, events or trips. Because the Financial
129 Disclosure Act applies to legislative officers, such as the Secretary of the Senate and the Chief
130 Clerk of the Assembly, and to certain senior staff members of the Legislative Counsel Bureau,

Senate Amendment No. 769 to Senate Bill No. 226 Page 6
131 such as the Director and the chiefs of the divisions, they are required to report the educational
132 or informational meetings, events or trips on financial disclosure statements. By contrast, if
133 rank-and-file legislative staff members have the approval of their chief administrative
134 supervisors to undertake or attend any educational or informational meetings, events or trips,
135 they are not required to report the educational or informational meetings, events or trips on
136 financial disclosure statements, unless they qualify as a public officer or candidate or a
137 member of a public officer’s or candidate’s household for the purposes of the Financial
138 Disclosure Act. (NRS 281.005, 281.558, 281.5583, 281.5587)

47 impaired by federal ownership of land are matters of continuing concern to this
48 State.

1 3. Experience with federal regulations relating to public lands has
2 demonstrated that the State of Nevada and its citizens are subjected to regulations
3 which sometimes are unreasonable, arbitrary, beyond the intent of the Congress or
4 the scope of the authority of the agency adopting them and that as a result these
5 regulations should be subjected to legislative review and comment, and judicially
6 tested where appropriate, to protect the rights and interests of the State and its
7 citizens.
8 4. Other western states where public lands comprise a large proportion of the
9 total area have shown an interest in matters relating to public lands and those states,
10 along with Nevada, have been actively participating in cooperative efforts to
11 acquire, evaluate and share information and promote greater understanding of the
