Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes various legislative interim committees that are created
2 or authorized to conduct studies or investigations or perform other legislative
3 business during the interim between legislative sessions, and existing law provides
-
*SB226_R1*
– 2 –
4 for the appointment or designation of chairs and vice chairs of such interim
5 committees. (Chapter 218E of NRS, NRS 232B.210-232B.250) Existing law also
6 contains provisions that apply exclusively to such interim committees without
7 applying to any session committees. (NRS 218E.105-218E.140)
8 Under existing common-law principles of parliamentary law, the chair of a
9 committee serves as the presiding officer of the committee and may take, direct or
10 require any necessary and reasonable actions to carry out the committee’s
11 management, government, budget, meetings and proceedings, subject to the laws
12 and rules governing the committee. In addition, if a vacancy occurs in the position
13 of chair, or if the chair is prohibited or disqualified from participating or acting on a
14 particular matter for any reason or is absent, disabled or otherwise unavailable or
15 unable to carry out the position for any reason, the vice chair of the committee
16 serves as the acting chair, with all the powers, privileges and immunities of the
17 position of chair, until the vacancy is filled or the chair is eligible, available or able
18 to carry out the position again, as applicable. (Mason’s Manual of Legislative
19 Procedure §§ 575-579, 608-611 (2020); Luther S. Cushing, Elements of the Law &
20 Practice of Legislative Assemblies §§ 287, 308, 313, 314, 1910 (1856); Hicks v.
21 Long Branch Comm’n, 55 A. 250, 250-51 (N.J. 1903)) To assist interim committees
22 in conducting their legislative business consistently with existing common-law
23 principles of parliamentary law, sections 2-4 of this bill codify those existing
24 common-law principles into the statutory provisions that apply to interim
25 committees. (Welfare Div. v. Maynard, 84 Nev. 525, 529 (1968) (“A statutory
26 enactment can be simply a legislative pronouncement of already existing law.”);
27 State Gaming Comm’n v. Southwest Sec., 108 Nev. 379, 383-84 (1992))
28 Existing law: (1) establishes Joint Interim Standing Committees of the
29 Legislature that are authorized to evaluate and review issues within the jurisdiction
30 of the corresponding standing committees from the preceding regular session of the
31 Legislature, exercise certain investigative powers and, under certain circumstances,
32 conduct studies directed by the Legislature or the Legislative Commission; (2)
33 provides for the appointment of regular members and alternate members to each
34 Joint Interim Standing Committee; and (3) requires the Legislative Commission to
35 select a Chair and a Vice Chair for each Joint Interim Standing Committee. (NRS
36 218E.320, 218E.330)
37 Section 5 of this bill requires the appointing authorities to appoint the
38 committee members for each Joint Interim Standing Committee, along with the
39 Chairs and Vice Chairs, not later than October 31 following the adjournment of
40 each regular session. Section 5 also clarifies the length of the terms that the
41 committee members and the Chairs and Vice Chairs serve while qualified.
42 Section 6 of this bill provides that if a regular member cannot attend a meeting
43 of the Committee, an alternate member must be of the same political party as the
44 regular member, and section 6 clarifies that, when acting in place of a regular
45 member, an alternate member has all the powers, privileges and immunities of a
46 regular member.
47 Existing law requires the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Legislative
48 Operations and Elections to evaluate and review issues relating to governmental
49 purchasing. (NRS 218E.330) Section 7 of this bill transfers such duties to the Joint
50 Interim Standing Committee on Government Affairs. Section 36 of this bill makes
51 a conforming change to require that the biennial report on recommendations for
52 legislation relating to governmental purchasing in existing law be submitted to the
53 Joint Interim Standing Committee on Government Affairs. (NRS 332.215)
54 Existing law creates the Subcommittee on Public Lands of the Joint Interim
55 Standing Committee on Natural Resources and prescribes the Subcommittee’s
56 powers and duties. (NRS 218E.500-218E.525, NRS 321.7355) Sections 8-10 and
57 35 of this bill: (1) make the Subcommittee a stand-alone interim committee instead
58 of a subcommittee of the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Natural Resources
-
*SB226_R1*
– 3 –
59 and rename it as the Committee on Public Lands; and (2) revise the membership,
60 organization and operations of the Committee on Public Lands. Section 1 of this
61 bill authorizes the Committee on Public Lands to request 4 legislative measures and
62 eliminates the authority of the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Natural
63 Resources to request 4 additional legislative measures based on the
64 recommendations for legislation submitted by the former Subcommittee on Public
65 Lands. Section 9 requires the Committee on Public Lands to hold at least three
66 meetings during each legislative interim where the primary physical location of the
67 meeting is located in a different county for each such meeting other than Clark
68 County, Washoe County or Carson City. However, section 9 does not prohibit the
69 use of authorized remote-technology systems for each such meeting, including
70 when necessary to connect the primary physical location of the meeting to
71 additional physical locations for the meeting in Clark County, Washoe County or
72 Carson City.
73 Existing law creates: (1) the Legislative Committee for the Review and
74 Oversight of the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency and the Marlette Lake Water
75 System; and (2) the Legislative Committee on Senior Citizens, Veterans and Adults
76 With Special Needs. (NRS 218E.550-218E.570, 218E.745-218E.760) Sections 11
77 and 12 of this bill revise the membership, organization and operations of these
78 Committees.
79 Existing law creates the Sunset Subcommittee of the Legislative Commission.
80 (NRS 232B.210-232B.250) Sections 26-32 and 43 of this bill: (1) make the Sunset
81 Subcommittee a stand-alone interim committee instead of a subcommittee of the
82 Legislative Commission and rename it as the Sunset Committee of the Legislature;
83 and (2) revise the membership, organization and operations of the Sunset
84 Committee.
85 Existing law authorizes Joint Interim Standing Committees and other interim
86 committees to request the drafting of a certain number of legislative measures for
87 each regular session. (NRS 218D.160) Section 1 revises the number of such
88 requests that the renamed Sunset Committee of the Legislature is authorized to
89 make.
90 Section 43 eliminates the requirement in existing law that the Joint Interim
91 Standing Committee on Health and Human Services review certain regulations that
92 are proposed or adopted by certain licensing boards and that are related to health
93 care. (NRS 439B.225) Sections 33 and 34 of this bill make conforming changes as
94 a result of the elimination of this requirement.
95 Existing law requires a teacher who wishes to serve on the Nevada State
96 Teacher and Education Support Professional Recruitment and Retention Advisory
97 Task Force to submit an application to the Joint Interim Standing Committee on
98 Education on or before January 15 of an even-numbered year. (NRS 391.494)
99 Section 38 of this bill moves the due date of the application to December 1 of an
100 odd-numbered year.
101 Existing law requires various reports, documents and other information to be
102 compiled by state or local governmental agencies or other entities and then reported
103 to certain legislative committees or staff. (NRS 193.309, 209.192, 209.461,
104 209.4818, 388.887, 449.242) Sections 22-25 and 37-39 of this bill revise those
105 reporting requirements.
106 Under existing law, the Nevada Lobbying Disclosure and Regulation Act
107 (Lobbying Act) prohibits, with certain exceptions, Legislators, legislative officers
108 and legislative staff members from knowingly or willfully soliciting or accepting
109 any gift from a lobbyist, whether or not the Legislature is in a regular or special
110 session. (NRS 218H.060, 218H.090, 218H.930) Under existing exceptions to the
111 gift prohibitions, if Legislators or members of their households receive anything of
112 value from a lobbyist to undertake or attend any educational or informational
113 meetings, events or trips, such meetings, events or trips are excluded from the term
-
*SB226_R1*
– 4 –
114 “gift” under the Lobbying Act, but the Legislators are required to report the
115 educational or informational meetings, events or trips on their financial disclosure
116 statements under the Nevada Financial Disclosure Act (Financial Disclosure Act).
117 (NRS 218H.045, 218H.060, 281.5583, 281.571)
118 Sections 13-20 of this bill create exceptions for legislative committee
119 investigative meetings, events or trips. Section 15 defines a “legislative committee
120 investigative meeting, event or trip” to include any meetings, events or trips that the
121 chair of a legislative committee authorizes as official meetings, events or trips of
122 the committee in order for the members of the committee and legislative staff
123 members to investigate or otherwise receive any education or information on
124 matters that are pertinent to the committee’s legislative business or possible future
125 legislative action. Based on the exceptions in sections 17 and 19, such legislative
126 committee investigative meetings, events or trips are not required to be reported on
127 financial disclosure statements under the Financial Disclosure Act. (NRS 281.5583,
128 281.5585)
129 Sections 17 and 19 also make the existing exceptions for educational or
130 informational meetings, events or trips applicable to: (1) legislative officers, such as
131 the Secretary of the Senate and the Chief Clerk of the Assembly; and (2) legislative
132 staff members but only if such staff members have the approval of their chief
133 administrative supervisors to undertake or attend the educational or informational
134 meetings, events or trips. Because the Financial Disclosure Act applies to
135 legislative officers, such as the Secretary of the Senate and the Chief Clerk of the
136 Assembly, and to certain senior staff members of the Legislative Counsel Bureau,
137 such as the Director and the chiefs of the divisions, they are required to report the
138 educational or informational meetings, events or trips on financial disclosure
139 statements. By contrast, if rank-and-file legislative staff members have the approval
140 of their chief administrative supervisors to undertake or attend any educational or
141 informational meetings, events or trips, they are not required to report the
142 educational or informational meetings, events or trips on financial disclosure
143 statements, unless they qualify as a public officer or candidate or a member of a
144 public officer’s or candidate’s household for the purposes of the Financial
145 Disclosure Act. (NRS 281.005, 281.558, 281.5583, 281.5587)

1 1. Policies and issues relating to public lands and state
2 sovereignty as impaired by federal ownership of land are matters of
3 continuing concern to this State.
4 2. This concern necessarily includes an awareness that all
5 federal statutes, policies and regulations which affect the
6 management of public lands are likely to have extensive effects
7 within the State and must not be ignored or automatically dismissed
8 as beyond the reach of the state’s policymakers.
9 3. Experience with federal regulations relating to public lands
10 has demonstrated that the State of Nevada and its citizens are
11 subjected to regulations which sometimes are unreasonable,
12 arbitrary, beyond the intent of the Congress or the scope of the
13 authority of the agency adopting them and that as a result these
14 regulations should be subjected to legislative review and comment,
15 and judicially tested where appropriate, to protect the rights and
16 interests of the State and its citizens.
17 4. Other western states where public lands comprise a large
18 proportion of the total area have shown an interest in matters
19 relating to public lands and those states, along with Nevada, have
20 been actively participating in cooperative efforts to acquire, evaluate
21 and share information and promote greater understanding of the

1 Existing law establishes various legislative interim committees that are created
2 or authorized to conduct studies or investigations or perform other legislative
3 business during the interim between legislative sessions, and existing law provides
-
*SB226_R1*

– 2 –
4 for the appointment or designation of chairs and vice chairs of such interim
5 committees. (Chapter 218E of NRS, NRS 232B.210-232B.250) Existing law also
6 contains provisions that apply exclusively to such interim committees without
7 applying to any session committees. (NRS 218E.105-218E.140)
8 Under existing common-law principles of parliamentary law, the chair of a
9 committee serves as the presiding officer of the committee and may take, direct or
10 require any necessary and reasonable actions to carry out the committee’s
11 management, government, budget, meetings and proceedings, subject to the laws
12 and rules governing the committee. In addition, if a vacancy occurs in the position
13 of chair, or if the chair is prohibited or disqualified from participating or acting on a
14 particular matter for any reason or is absent, disabled or otherwise unavailable or
15 unable to carry out the position for any reason, the vice chair of the committee
16 serves as the acting chair, with all the powers, privileges and immunities of the
17 position of chair, until the vacancy is filled or the chair is eligible, available or able
18 to carry out the position again, as applicable. (Mason’s Manual of Legislative
19 Procedure §§ 575-579, 608-611 (2020); Luther S. Cushing, Elements of the Law &
20 Practice of Legislative Assemblies §§ 287, 308, 313, 314, 1910 (1856); Hicks v.
21 Long Branch Comm’n, 55 A. 250, 250-51 (N.J. 1903)) To assist interim committees
22 in conducting their legislative business consistently with existing common-law
23 principles of parliamentary law, sections 2-4 of this bill codify those existing
24 common-law principles into the statutory provisions that apply to interim
25 committees. (Welfare Div. v. Maynard, 84 Nev. 525, 529 (1968) (“A statutory
26 enactment can be simply a legislative pronouncement of already existing law.”);
27 State Gaming Comm’n v. Southwest Sec., 108 Nev. 379, 383-84 (1992))
28 Existing law: (1) establishes Joint Interim Standing Committees of the
29 Legislature that are authorized to evaluate and review issues within the jurisdiction
30 of the corresponding standing committees from the preceding regular session of the
31 Legislature, exercise certain investigative powers and, under certain circumstances,
32 conduct studies directed by the Legislature or the Legislative Commission; (2)
33 provides for the appointment of regular members and alternate members to each
34 Joint Interim Standing Committee; and (3) requires the Legislative Commission to
35 select a Chair and a Vice Chair for each Joint Interim Standing Committee. (NRS
36 218E.320, 218E.330)
37 Section 5 of this bill requires the appointing authorities to appoint the
38 committee members for each Joint Interim Standing Committee, along with the
39 Chairs and Vice Chairs, not later than October 31 following the adjournment of
40 each regular session. Section 5 also clarifies the length of the terms that the
41 committee members and the Chairs and Vice Chairs serve while qualified.
42 Section 6 of this bill provides that if a regular member cannot attend a meeting
43 of the Committee, an alternate member must be of the same political party as the
44 regular member, and section 6 clarifies that, when acting in place of a regular
45 member, an alternate member has all the powers, privileges and immunities of a
46 regular member.
47 Existing law requires the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Legislative
48 Operations and Elections to evaluate and review issues relating to governmental
49 purchasing. (NRS 218E.330) Section 7 of this bill transfers such duties to the Joint
50 Interim Standing Committee on Government Affairs. Section 36 of this bill makes
51 a conforming change to require that the biennial report on recommendations for
52 legislation relating to governmental purchasing in existing law be submitted to the
53 Joint Interim Standing Committee on Government Affairs. (NRS 332.215)
54 Existing law creates the Subcommittee on Public Lands of the Joint Interim
55 Standing Committee on Natural Resources and prescribes the Subcommittee’s
56 powers and duties. (NRS 218E.500-218E.525, NRS 321.7355) Sections 8-10 and
57 35 of this bill: (1) make the Subcommittee a stand-alone interim committee instead
58 of a subcommittee of the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Natural Resources
-
*SB226_R1*

– 3 –
59 and rename it as the Committee on Public Lands; and (2) revise the membership,
60 organization and operations of the Committee on Public Lands. Section 1 of this
61 bill authorizes the Committee on Public Lands to request 4 legislative measures and
62 eliminates the authority of the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Natural
63 Resources to request 4 additional legislative measures based on the
64 recommendations for legislation submitted by the former Subcommittee on Public
65 Lands. Section 9 requires the Committee on Public Lands to hold at least three
66 meetings during each legislative interim where the primary physical location of the
67 meeting is located in a different county for each such meeting other than Clark
68 County, Washoe County or Carson City. However, section 9 does not prohibit the
69 use of authorized remote-technology systems for each such meeting, including
70 when necessary to connect the primary physical location of the meeting to
71 additional physical locations for the meeting in Clark County, Washoe County or
72 Carson City.
73 Existing law creates: (1) the Legislative Committee for the Review and
74 Oversight of the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency and the Marlette Lake Water
75 System; and (2) the Legislative Committee on Senior Citizens, Veterans and Adults
76 With Special Needs. (NRS 218E.550-218E.570, 218E.745-218E.760) Sections 11
77 and 12 of this bill revise the membership, organization and operations of these
78 Committees.
79 Existing law creates the Sunset Subcommittee of the Legislative Commission.
80 (NRS 232B.210-232B.250) Sections 26-32 and 43 of this bill: (1) make the Sunset
81 Subcommittee a stand-alone interim committee instead of a subcommittee of the
82 Legislative Commission and rename it as the Sunset Committee of the Legislature;
83 and (2) revise the membership, organization and operations of the Sunset
84 Committee.
85 Existing law authorizes Joint Interim Standing Committees and other interim
86 committees to request the drafting of a certain number of legislative measures for
87 each regular session. (NRS 218D.160) Section 1 revises the number of such
88 requests that the renamed Sunset Committee of the Legislature is authorized to
89 make.
90 Section 43 eliminates the requirement in existing law that the Joint Interim
91 Standing Committee on Health and Human Services review certain regulations that
92 are proposed or adopted by certain licensing boards and that are related to health
93 care. (NRS 439B.225) Sections 33 and 34 of this bill make conforming changes as
94 a result of the elimination of this requirement.
95 Existing law requires a teacher who wishes to serve on the Nevada State
96 Teacher and Education Support Professional Recruitment and Retention Advisory
97 Task Force to submit an application to the Joint Interim Standing Committee on
98 Education on or before January 15 of an even-numbered year. (NRS 391.494)
99 Section 38 of this bill moves the due date of the application to December 1 of an
100 odd-numbered year.
101 Existing law requires various reports, documents and other information to be
102 compiled by state or local governmental agencies or other entities and then reported
103 to certain legislative committees or staff. (NRS 193.309, 209.192, 209.461,
104 209.4818, 388.887, 449.242) Sections 22-25 and 37-39 of this bill revise those
105 reporting requirements.
106 Under existing law, the Nevada Lobbying Disclosure and Regulation Act
107 (Lobbying Act) prohibits, with certain exceptions, Legislators, legislative officers
108 and legislative staff members from knowingly or willfully soliciting or accepting
109 any gift from a lobbyist, whether or not the Legislature is in a regular or special
110 session. (NRS 218H.060, 218H.090, 218H.930) Under existing exceptions to the
111 gift prohibitions, if Legislators or members of their households receive anything of
112 value from a lobbyist to undertake or attend any educational or informational
113 meetings, events or trips, such meetings, events or trips are excluded from the term
-
*SB226_R1*

– 4 –
114 “gift” under the Lobbying Act, but the Legislators are required to report the
115 educational or informational meetings, events or trips on their financial disclosure
116 statements under the Nevada Financial Disclosure Act (Financial Disclosure Act).
117 (NRS 218H.045, 218H.060, 281.5583, 281.571)
118 Sections 13-20 of this bill create exceptions for legislative committee
119 investigative meetings, events or trips. Section 15 defines a “legislative committee
120 investigative meeting, event or trip” to include any meetings, events or trips that the
121 chair of a legislative committee authorizes as official meetings, events or trips of
122 the committee in order for the members of the committee and legislative staff
123 members to investigate or otherwise receive any education or information on
124 matters that are pertinent to the committee’s legislative business or possible future
125 legislative action. Based on the exceptions in sections 17 and 19, such legislative
126 committee investigative meetings, events or trips are not required to be reported on
127 financial disclosure statements under the Financial Disclosure Act. (NRS 281.5583,
128 281.5585)
129 Sections 17 and 19 also make the existing exceptions for educational or
130 informational meetings, events or trips applicable to: (1) legislative officers, such as
131 the Secretary of the Senate and the Chief Clerk of the Assembly; and (2) legislative
132 staff members but only if such staff members have the approval of their chief
133 administrative supervisors to undertake or attend the educational or informational
134 meetings, events or trips. Because the Financial Disclosure Act applies to
135 legislative officers, such as the Secretary of the Senate and the Chief Clerk of the
136 Assembly, and to certain senior staff members of the Legislative Counsel Bureau,
137 such as the Director and the chiefs of the divisions, they are required to report the
138 educational or informational meetings, events or trips on financial disclosure
139 statements. By contrast, if rank-and-file legislative staff members have the approval
140 of their chief administrative supervisors to undertake or attend any educational or
141 informational meetings, events or trips, they are not required to report the
142 educational or informational meetings, events or trips on financial disclosure
143 statements, unless they qualify as a public officer or candidate or a member of a
144 public officer’s or candidate’s household for the purposes of the Financial
145 Disclosure Act. (NRS 281.005, 281.558, 281.5583, 281.5587)

44 218E.500 The Legislature finds and declares that:
-
*SB226_R1*

– 11 –
1 1. Policies and issues relating to public lands and state
2 sovereignty as impaired by federal ownership of land are matters of
3 continuing concern to this State.
4 2. This concern necessarily includes an awareness that all
5 federal statutes, policies and regulations which affect the
6 management of public lands are likely to have extensive effects
7 within the State and must not be ignored or automatically dismissed
8 as beyond the reach of the state’s policymakers.
9 3. Experience with federal regulations relating to public lands
10 has demonstrated that the State of Nevada and its citizens are
