Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law establishes various legislative interim committees that are created
or authorized to conduct studies or investigations or perform other legislative
business during the interim between legislative sessions, and existing law provides
for the appointment or designation of chairs and vice chairs of such interim
committees. (Chapter 218E of NRS, NRS 232B.210-232B.250) Existing law also
contains provisions that apply exclusively to such interim committees without
applying to any session committees. (NRS 218E.105-218E.140)
Under existing common-law principles of parliamentary law, the chair of a
committee serves as the presiding officer of the committee and may take, direct or
require any necessary and reasonable actions to carry out the committee’s
management, government, budget, meetings and proceedings, subject to the laws
and rules governing the committee. In addition, if a vacancy occurs in the position
of chair, or if the chair is prohibited or disqualified from participating or acting on a
particular matter for any reason or is absent, disabled or otherwise unavailable or
unable to carry out the position for any reason, the vice chair of the committee
serves as the acting chair, with all the powers, privileges and immunities of the
position of chair, until the vacancy is filled or the chair is eligible, available or able
to carry out the position again, as applicable. (Mason’s Manual of Legislative
Procedure §§ 575-579, 608-611 (2020); Luther S. Cushing, Elements of the Law &
Practice of Legislative Assemblies §§ 287, 308, 313, 314, 1910 (1856); Hicks v.
Long Branch Comm’n, 55 A. 250, 250-51 (N.J. 1903)) To assist interim committees
in conducting their legislative business consistently with existing common-law
principles of parliamentary law, sections 2-4 of this bill codify those existing
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 2 –
common-law principles into the statutory provisions that apply to interim
committees. (Welfare Div. v. Maynard, 84 Nev. 525, 529 (1968) (“A statutory
enactment can be simply a legislative pronouncement of already existing law.”);
State Gaming Comm’n v. Southwest Sec., 108 Nev. 379, 383-84 (1992))
Existing law: (1) establishes Joint Interim Standing Committees of the
Legislature that are authorized to evaluate and review issues within the jurisdiction
of the corresponding standing committees from the preceding regular session of the
Legislature, exercise certain investigative powers and, under certain circumstances,
conduct studies directed by the Legislature or the Legislative Commission; (2)
provides for the appointment of regular members and alternate members to each
Joint Interim Standing Committee; and (3) requires the Legislative Commission to
select a Chair and a Vice Chair for each Joint Interim Standing Committee. (NRS
218E.320, 218E.330)
Section 5 of this bill requires the appointing authorities to appoint the
committee members for each Joint Interim Standing Committee, along with the
Chairs and Vice Chairs, not later than October 31 following the adjournment of
each regular session. Section 5 also clarifies the length of the terms that the
committee members and the Chairs and Vice Chairs serve while qualified.
Section 6 of this bill provides that if a regular member cannot attend a meeting
of the Committee, an alternate member must be of the same political party as the
regular member, and section 6 clarifies that, when acting in place of a regular
member, an alternate member has all the powers, privileges and immunities of a
regular member.
Existing law requires the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Legislative
Operations and Elections to evaluate and review issues relating to governmental
purchasing. (NRS 218E.330) Section 7 of this bill transfers such duties to the Joint
Interim Standing Committee on Government Affairs. Section 36 of this bill makes
a conforming change to require that the biennial report on recommendations for
legislation relating to governmental purchasing in existing law be submitted to the
Joint Interim Standing Committee on Government Affairs. (NRS 332.215)
Existing law creates the Subcommittee on Public Lands of the Joint Interim
Standing Committee on Natural Resources and prescribes the Subcommittee’s
powers and duties. (NRS 218E.500-218E.525, NRS 321.7355) Sections 8-10 and
35 of this bill: (1) make the Subcommittee a stand-alone interim committee instead
of a subcommittee of the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Natural Resources
and rename it as the Committee on Public Lands; and (2) revise the membership,
organization and operations of the Committee on Public Lands. Section 1 of this
bill authorizes the Committee on Public Lands to request 4 legislative measures and
eliminates the authority of the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Natural
Resources to request 4 additional legislative measures based on the
recommendations for legislation submitted by the former Subcommittee on Public
Lands. Section 9 requires the Committee on Public Lands to hold at least three
meetings during each legislative interim where the primary physical location of the
meeting is located in a different county for each such meeting other than Clark
County, Washoe County or Carson City. However, section 9 does not prohibit the
use of authorized remote-technology systems for each such meeting, including
when necessary to connect the primary physical location of the meeting to
additional physical locations for the meeting in Clark County, Washoe County or
Carson City.
Existing law creates: (1) the Legislative Committee for the Review and
Oversight of the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency and the Marlette Lake Water
System; and (2) the Legislative Committee on Senior Citizens, Veterans and Adults
With Special Needs. (NRS 218E.550-218E.570, 218E.745-218E.760) Sections 11
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 3 –
and 12 of this bill revise the membership, organization and operations of these
Committees.
Existing law creates the Sunset Subcommittee of the Legislative Commission.
(NRS 232B.210-232B.250) Sections 26-32 and 43 of this bill: (1) make the Sunset
Subcommittee a stand-alone interim committee instead of a subcommittee of the
Legislative Commission and rename it as the Sunset Committee of the Legislature;
and (2) revise the membership, organization and operations of the Sunset
Committee.
Existing law authorizes Joint Interim Standing Committees and other interim
committees to request the drafting of a certain number of legislative measures for
each regular session. (NRS 218D.160) Section 1 revises the number of such
requests that the renamed Sunset Committee of the Legislature is authorized to
make.
Section 43 eliminates the requirement in existing law that the Joint Interim
Standing Committee on Health and Human Services review certain regulations that
are proposed or adopted by certain licensing boards and that are related to health
care. (NRS 439B.225) Sections 33 and 34 of this bill make conforming changes as
a result of the elimination of this requirement.
Existing law requires a teacher who wishes to serve on the Nevada State
Teacher and Education Support Professional Recruitment and Retention Advisory
Task Force to submit an application to the Joint Interim Standing Committee on
Education on or before January 15 of an even-numbered year. (NRS 391.494)
Section 38 of this bill moves the due date of the application to December 1 of an
odd-numbered year.
Existing law requires various reports, documents and other information to be
compiled by state or local governmental agencies or other entities and then reported
to certain legislative committees or staff. (NRS 193.309, 209.192, 209.461,
209.4818, 388.887, 449.242) Sections 22-25 and 37-39 of this bill revise those
reporting requirements.
Under existing law, the Nevada Lobbying Disclosure and Regulation Act
(Lobbying Act) prohibits, with certain exceptions, Legislators, legislative officers
and legislative staff members from knowingly or willfully soliciting or accepting
any gift from a lobbyist, whether or not the Legislature is in a regular or special
session. (NRS 218H.060, 218H.090, 218H.930) Under existing exceptions to the
gift prohibitions, if Legislators or members of their households receive anything of
value from a lobbyist to undertake or attend any educational or informational
meetings, events or trips, such meetings, events or trips are excluded from the term
“gift” under the Lobbying Act, but the Legislators are required to report the
educational or informational meetings, events or trips on their financial disclosure
statements under the Nevada Financial Disclosure Act (Financial Disclosure Act).
(NRS 218H.045, 218H.060, 281.5583, 281.571)
Sections 13-20 of this bill create exceptions for legislative committee
investigative meetings, events or trips. Section 15 defines a “legislative committee
investigative meeting, event or trip” to include any meetings, events or trips that the
chair of a legislative committee authorizes as official meetings, events or trips of
the committee in order for the members of the committee and legislative staff
members to investigate or otherwise receive any education or information on
matters that are pertinent to the committee’s legislative business or possible future
legislative action. Based on the exceptions in sections 17 and 19, such legislative
committee investigative meetings, events or trips are not required to be reported on
financial disclosure statements under the Financial Disclosure Act. (NRS 281.5583,
281.5585)
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 4 –
Sections 17 and 19 also make the existing exceptions for educational or
informational meetings, events or trips applicable to: (1) legislative officers, such as
the Secretary of the Senate and the Chief Clerk of the Assembly; and (2) legislative
staff members but only if such staff members have the approval of their chief
administrative supervisors to undertake or attend the educational or informational
meetings, events or trips. Because the Financial Disclosure Act applies to
legislative officers, such as the Secretary of the Senate and the Chief Clerk of the
Assembly, and to certain senior staff members of the Legislative Counsel Bureau,
such as the Director and the chiefs of the divisions, they are required to report the
educational or informational meetings, events or trips on financial disclosure
statements. By contrast, if rank-and-file legislative staff members have the approval
of their chief administrative supervisors to undertake or attend any educational or
informational meetings, events or trips, they are not required to report the
educational or informational meetings, events or trips on financial disclosure
statements, unless they qualify as a public officer or candidate or a member of a
public officer’s or candidate’s household for the purposes of the Financial
Disclosure Act. (NRS 281.005, 281.558, 281.5583, 281.5587)
Existing law creates the Mining Oversight and Accountability Commission and
requires the Commission to provide oversight of compliance with Nevada law
relating to the activities of each state agency, board, bureau, commission,
department or division with respect to the taxation, operation, safety and
environmental regulation of mines and mining in this State. (NRS 514A.040,
514A.060) Section 40.5 of this bill provides that if the Commission fails to review
certain regulations relating to mines or mining within 90 days after adoption, the
regulations will become effective if approved in accordance with the applicable
provisions of the Nevada Administrative Procedure Act.

Sec. 8. NRS 218E.500 is hereby amended to read as follows:
218E.500 The Legislature finds and declares that:
1. Policies and issues relating to public lands and state
sovereignty as impaired by federal ownership of land are matters of
continuing concern to this State.
2. This concern necessarily includes an awareness that all
federal statutes, policies and regulations which affect the
management of public lands are likely to have extensive effects
within the State and must not be ignored or automatically dismissed
as beyond the reach of the state’s policymakers.
3. Experience with federal regulations relating to public lands
has demonstrated that the State of Nevada and its citizens are
subjected to regulations which sometimes are unreasonable,
arbitrary, beyond the intent of the Congress or the scope of the
authority of the agency adopting them and that as a result these
regulations should be subjected to legislative review and comment,
and judicially tested where appropriate, to protect the rights and
interests of the State and its citizens.
4. Other western states where public lands comprise a large
proportion of the total area have shown an interest in matters
relating to public lands and those states, along with Nevada, have
been actively participating in cooperative efforts to acquire, evaluate
and share information and promote greater understanding of the
issues. Since Nevada can both contribute to and benefit from such
interstate activities, it is appropriate that [a subcommittee on matters
relating to public lands] the Committee on Public Lands be
assigned primary responsibility for participating in them.
Sec. 8.3. NRS 218E.505 is hereby amended to read as follows:
218E.505 As used in NRS 218E.500 to 218E.525, inclusive,
unless the context otherwise requires, [“Subcommittee”]
“Committee” means the [Subcommittee] Committee on Public
Lands . [of the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Natural
Resources.]

Committee on Natural Resources,] consisting of eight members

3. The [Chair of the Joint Interim Standing Committee on

of Chair or Vice Chair, the vacancy must be filled in the same
manner as the original appointment for the remainder of the
unexpired term.]
4. [Any] Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, a
member of the Committee holds his or her membership on the
