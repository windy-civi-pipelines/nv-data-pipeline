AN ACT relating to health care; prohibiting certain health insurers

discriminatory actions; and providing other matters

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing federal law prohibits certain health care entities from discriminating
2 on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, age or disability. (45 C.F.R. §§
3 92.101, 92.206, 92.208, 92.209) Existing law prohibits certain public and private
4 policies of health insurance from discriminating against any person with respect to
5 participation or coverage under the policy on the basis of actual or perceived gender
6 identity or expression. (NRS 287.010, 287.04335, 422.2701, 608.1555, 689A.033,
7 689B.0675, 689C.1975, 689C.425, 695A.198, 695B.3167, 695C.050, 695C.204,
8 695G.415) Sections 1-8 of this bill additionally prohibit certain public and private
9 policies of health insurance, including Medicaid, from discriminating against any
10 person on the basis of actual or perceived race, color, national origin, sex, age,
11 sexual orientation or disability. Section 9 of this bill similarly prohibits a provider
12 of health care from discriminating against a person on the basis of those same
13 characteristics, as well as gender identity or expression. Section 9 also authorizes a
14 board, agency or other entity in this State that licenses, certifies or regulates
15 providers of health care to: (1) adopt regulations prescribing the specific types of
