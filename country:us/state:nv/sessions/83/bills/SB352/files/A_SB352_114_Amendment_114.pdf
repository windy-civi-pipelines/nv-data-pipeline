AN ACT relating to health care; prohibiting certain health insurers and providers of
health care from engaging in certain discriminatory actions; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing federal law prohibits certain health care entities from discriminating on the basis
2 of race, color, national origin, sex, age or disability. (45 C.F.R. §§ 92.101, 92.206, 92.208,
3 92.209) Existing law prohibits certain public and private policies of health insurance from
4 discriminating against any person with respect to participation or coverage under the policy on
5 the basis of actual or perceived gender identity or expression. (NRS 287.010, 287.04335,
6 422.2701, 608.1555, 689A.033, 689B.0675, 689C.1975, 689C.425, 695A.198, 695B.3167,
7 695C.050, 695C.204, 695G.415) Sections 1-8 of this bill additionally prohibit public and
8 private policies of health insurance, including Medicaid, from discriminating against any
9 person on the basis of actual or perceived race, color, national origin, sex, age or disability.
10 Section 9 of this bill similarly prohibits a provider of health care from discriminating against a
11 person on the basis of those same characteristics, as well as gender identity or expression.
12 Section 9 also authorizes a board, agency or other entity in this State that licenses, certifies or
13 regulates providers of health care to: (1) adopt regulations prescribing the specific types of
14 discrimination prohibited; and (2) discipline a provider of health care who violates section 9.
