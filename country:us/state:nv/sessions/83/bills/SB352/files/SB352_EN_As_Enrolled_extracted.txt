CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to health care; prohibiting certain health insurers
and providers of health care from engaging in certain
discriminatory actions; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing federal law prohibits certain health care entities from discriminating
on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, age or disability. (45 C.F.R. §§
92.101, 92.206, 92.208, 92.209) Existing law prohibits certain public and private
policies of health insurance from discriminating against any person with respect to
participation or coverage under the policy on the basis of actual or perceived gender
identity or expression. (NRS 287.010, 287.04335, 422.2701, 608.1555, 689A.033,
689B.0675, 689C.1975, 689C.425, 695A.198, 695B.3167, 695C.050, 695C.204,
695G.415) Sections 1-8 of this bill additionally prohibit certain public and private
policies of health insurance, including Medicaid, from discriminating against any
person on the basis of actual or perceived race, color, national origin, sex, age,
sexual orientation or disability. Section 9 of this bill similarly prohibits a provider
of health care from discriminating against a person on the basis of those same
characteristics, as well as gender identity or expression. Section 9 also authorizes a
board, agency or other entity in this State that licenses, certifies or regulates
providers of health care to: (1) adopt regulations prescribing the specific types of
discrimination prohibited; and (2) discipline a provider of health care who violates
section 9.
