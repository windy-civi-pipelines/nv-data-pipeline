Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing federal law prohibits certain health care entities from discriminating
2 on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, age or disability. (45 C.F.R. §§
3 92.101, 92.206, 92.208, 92.209) Existing law prohibits certain public and private
4 policies of health insurance from discriminating against any person with respect to
5 participation or coverage under the policy on basis of actual or perceived gender
6 identity or expression. (NRS 287.010, 287.04335, 422.2701, 608.1555, 689A.033,
7 689B.0675, 689C.1975, 689C.425, 695A.198, 695B.3167, 695C.050, 695C.204,
8 695G.415) Sections 1-8 of this bill additionally prohibit public and private policies
9 of health insurance, including Medicaid, from discriminating against any person on
10 the basis of actual or perceived race, color, national origin, sex, age or disability.
11 Section 9 of this bill similarly prohibits a provider of health care from
12 discriminating against a person on the basis of those same characteristics, as well as
13 gender identity or expression. Section 9 also authorizes a board, agency or other
14 entity in this State that licenses, certifies or regulates providers of health care to:
