AN ACT relating to health care; prohibiting certain health insurers
and providers of health care from engaging in certain
discriminatory actions; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing federal law prohibits certain health care entities from discriminating
2 on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, age or disability. (45 C.F.R. §§
3 92.101, 92.206, 92.208, 92.209) Existing law prohibits certain public and private
4 policies of health insurance from discriminating against any person with respect to
5 participation or coverage under the policy on the basis of actual or perceived gender
6 identity or expression. (NRS 287.010, 287.04335, 422.2701, 608.1555, 689A.033,
7 689B.0675, 689C.1975, 689C.425, 695A.198, 695B.3167, 695C.050, 695C.204,
8 695G.415) Sections 1-8 of this bill additionally prohibit public and private policies
9 of health insurance, including Medicaid, from discriminating against any person on
10 the basis of actual or perceived race, color, national origin, sex, age, sexual
11 orientation or disability. Section 9 of this bill similarly prohibits a provider of
12 health care from discriminating against a person on the basis of those same
13 characteristics, as well as gender identity or expression. Section 9 also authorizes a
14 board, agency or other entity in this State that licenses, certifies or regulates
15 providers of health care to: (1) adopt regulations prescribing the specific types of
-

AN ACT relating to health care; prohibiting certain health insurers
and providers of health care from engaging in certain
discriminatory actions; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing federal law prohibits certain health care entities from discriminating
2 on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, age or disability. (45 C.F.R. §§
3 92.101, 92.206, 92.208, 92.209) Existing law prohibits certain public and private
4 policies of health insurance from discriminating against any person with respect to
5 participation or coverage under the policy on the basis of actual or perceived gender
6 identity or expression. (NRS 287.010, 287.04335, 422.2701, 608.1555, 689A.033,
7 689B.0675, 689C.1975, 689C.425, 695A.198, 695B.3167, 695C.050, 695C.204,
8 695G.415) Sections 1-8 of this bill additionally prohibit public and private policies
9 of health insurance, including Medicaid, from discriminating against any person on
10 the basis of actual or perceived race, color, national origin, sex, age, sexual
11 orientation or disability. Section 9 of this bill similarly prohibits a provider of
12 health care from discriminating against a person on the basis of those same
13 characteristics, as well as gender identity or expression. Section 9 also authorizes a
14 board, agency or other entity in this State that licenses, certifies or regulates
15 providers of health care to: (1) adopt regulations prescribing the specific types of
