EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; transferring the authority to
establish and administer a program of all-inclusive care
for the elderly from the Aging and Disability Services
Division of the Department of Health and Human
Services to the Department; requiring the Department to
establish such a program; requiring the Community
Advocate within the Division to provide certain services
relating to the program; making an appropriation; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing federal law authorizes a state to establish a program, commonly
2 known as a program of all-inclusive care for the elderly or PACE program, to
3 provide services to certain recipients of Medicare and Medicaid who are 55 years of
4 age or older. (42 U.S.C. §§ 1395eee, 1396u-4) Existing state law authorizes the
5 Aging and Disability Services Division of the Department of Health and Human
6 Services to establish and administer a PACE program. (NRS 427A.255, 427A.260)
7 Sections 2 and 8 of this bill eliminate the authority of the Division to establish
8 a PACE program, and sections 2-4 of this bill remove references in existing law to
9 such a PACE program. Instead, section 1 of this bill requires the Department
10 through any of its divisions to establish and administer a PACE program. Section 6
11 of this bill makes a conforming change to require the Director of the Department to
12 administer the provisions of section 1 in the same manner as the provisions of
13 existing law governing Medicaid and certain other programs administered by the
14 Department.
15 Existing law: (1) creates the Office of the Community Advocate within the
16 Division; and (2) requires the Community Advocate to assist in coordinating
17 resources and services available to aging persons within their respective
18 communities, including any PACE program established by the Division.

*SB207_R2*

– 2 –
19 (NRS 427A.300, 427A.310) Section 4 replaces the reference to the PACE program
20 established by the Division with a reference to the PACE program established by
21 the Department pursuant to section 1, thereby requiring the Community Advocate
22 to provide assistance related to that PACE program. Sections 5 and 7 of this bill
23 make conforming changes so that the PACE program created by section 1 is treated
24 similarly to any PACE program that would have been created under the authority
25 eliminated by section 8 for purposes relating to: (1) the division of the community
26 income, assets and obligations of a married couple into separate income for the
27 purpose of qualifying for such a program; and (2) activities of a home care
28 program, which is a program, including a PACE program, established by a state
29 agency or a local government which provides in the home personal care services,
30 personal assistance or temporary respite services to elderly persons or persons with
31 disabilities. Section 7.5 of this bill appropriates money to and authorizes
32 expenditures by the Division of Health Care Financing and Policy of the
33 Department to pay the costs of establishing and administering the PACE program.

11 123.259 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2, a
12 court of competent jurisdiction may, upon a proper petition filed by
13 a spouse or the guardian of a spouse, enter a decree dividing the
14 income and resources of a married couple pursuant to this section if
15 one spouse is an institutionalized spouse and the other spouse is a
16 community spouse.
17 2. The court shall not enter such a decree if the division is
18 contrary to a premarital agreement between the spouses which is
19 enforceable pursuant to chapter 123A of NRS.
20 3. Unless modified pursuant to subsection 4 or 5, the court may
21 divide the income and resources:

33 for that finding, the court may enter an order for support against the
34 institutionalized spouse for the support of the community spouse in

36 necessary.
37 5. If either spouse establishes that a transfer of resources to the
38 community spouse pursuant to paragraph (b) of subsection 3, in
39 relation to the amount of income generated by such a transfer, is
40 inadequate to raise the income of the community spouse to the
41 amount allowed under paragraph (b) of subsection 3 or an order for
42 support issued pursuant to subsection 4, the court may substitute an
43 amount of resources adequate to provide income to fund the amount
44 so allowed or to fund the order for support.

15 spouses. Such an agreement is effective only if one spouse is an
16 institutionalized spouse and the other spouse is a community spouse
