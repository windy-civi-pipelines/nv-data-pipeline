EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; transferring the authority to
establish and administer a program of all-inclusive care
for the elderly from the Aging and Disability Services
Division of the Department of Health and Human
Services to the Department; requiring the Department to
establish such a program; requiring the Community
Advocate to provide certain services relating to the
program; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing federal law authorizes a state to establish a program, commonly
2 known as a program of all-inclusive care for the elderly or PACE program, to
3 provide services to certain recipients of Medicare and Medicaid who are 55 years of
4 age or older. (42 U.S.C. §§ 1395eee and 1396u-4) Existing state law authorizes the
5 Aging and Disability Services Division of the Department of Health and Human
6 Services to establish and administer a PACE program. (NRS 427A.255, 427A.260)
7 Sections 2 and 8 of this bill eliminate the authority of the Division to establish
8 a PACE program, and sections 2-4 of this bill remove references, in existing law to
9 such a PACE program. Instead, section 1 of this bill requires the Department
10 through any of its Divisions to establish and administer a PACE program that
11 utilizes federally-qualified health centers to provide services to persons enrolled in
12 the PACE program. Section 6 of this bill makes a conforming change to require the
13 Director of the Department to administer the provisions of section 1 in the same
14 manner as the provisions of existing law governing Medicaid and certain other
15 programs administered by the Department.
16 Existing law: (1) creates the Office of the Community Advocate within the
17 Division; and (2) requires the Community Advocate to assist in coordinating
18 resources and services available to aging persons within their respective
-
*SB207*

– 2 –
19 communities, including any PACE program established by the Division. (NRS
20 427A.300, 427A.310) Section 4 replaces the reference to the PACE program
21 established by the Division with a reference to the PACE program established by
22 the Department pursuant to section 1, thereby requiring the Community Advocate
23 to provide assistance related to that PACE program. Sections 5 and 7 of this bill
24 make conforming changes so that the PACE program created by section 1 is treated
25 similarly to any PACE program that would have been created under the authority
26 eliminated by section 8 for purposes relating to: (1) the division of the community
27 income, assets and obligations of a married couple into separate income for the
28 purpose of qualifying for such a program; and (2) activities of a home care
29 program, which is a program, including a PACE program, established by a state
30 agency or a local government which provides in the home personal care services,
31 personal assistance or temporary respite services to elderly persons or persons with
32 disabilities.

13 123.259 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2, a
14 court of competent jurisdiction may, upon a proper petition filed by
15 a spouse or the guardian of a spouse, enter a decree dividing the
16 income and resources of a married couple pursuant to this section if
17 one spouse is an institutionalized spouse and the other spouse is a
18 community spouse.
19 2. The court shall not enter such a decree if the division is
20 contrary to a premarital agreement between the spouses which is
21 enforceable pursuant to chapter 123A of NRS.
22 3. Unless modified pursuant to subsection 4 or 5, the court may
23 divide the income and resources:
24 (a) Equally between the spouses; or
25 (b) By protecting income for the community spouse through
26 application of the maximum federal minimum monthly maintenance
27 needs allowance set forth in 42 U.S.C. § 1396r-5(d)(3)(C) and by
28 permitting a transfer of resources to the community spouse an
29 amount which does not exceed the amount set forth in 42 U.S.C. §
30 1396r-5(f)(2)(A)(ii).
31 4. If either spouse establishes that the community spouse needs
32 income greater than that otherwise provided under paragraph (b) of

34 significant financial duress and setting forth in writing the reasons
35 for that finding, the court may enter an order for support against the
36 institutionalized spouse for the support of the community spouse in
37 an amount adequate to provide such additional income as is
38 necessary.
39 5. If either spouse establishes that a transfer of resources to the
40 community spouse pursuant to paragraph (b) of subsection 3, in
41 relation to the amount of income generated by such a transfer, is
42 inadequate to raise the income of the community spouse to the
43 amount allowed under paragraph (b) of subsection 3 or an order for
44 support issued pursuant to subsection 4, the court may substitute an
-
*SB207*

– 5 –

2 so allowed or to fund the order for support.
3 6. A copy of a petition for relief under subsection 4 or 5 and
4 any court order issued pursuant to such a petition must be served on
5 the Administrator of the Division of Welfare and Supportive
6 Services of the Department of Health and Human Services when
7 any application for medical assistance is made by or on behalf of an
8 institutionalized spouse. The Administrator may intervene no later
9 than 45 days after receipt by the Division of Welfare and Supportive
10 Services of the Department of Health and Human Services of an
11 application for medical assistance and a copy of the petition and any
12 order entered pursuant to subsection 4 or 5, and may move to
13 modify the order.
14 7. A person may enter into a written agreement with his or her
15 spouse dividing their community income, assets and obligations into
16 equal shares of separate income, assets and obligations of the
17 spouses. Such an agreement is effective only if one spouse is an
18 institutionalized spouse and the other spouse is a community spouse
19 or a division of the income or resources would allow one spouse to
20 qualify for services under NRS 427A.250 to 427A.280, inclusive [.]
21 , or section 1 of this act.
22 8. An agreement entered into or decree entered pursuant to this
23 section may not be binding on the Division of Welfare and
24 Supportive Services of the Department of Health and Human
25 Services in making determinations under the State Plan for
26 Medicaid.
27 9. As used in this section, “community spouse” and
28 “institutionalized spouse” have the meanings respectively ascribed
29 to them in 42 U.S.C. § 1396r-5(h).
