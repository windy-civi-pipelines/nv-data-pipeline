Senate Bill No. 207–Senators Taylor,
Doñate, Neal; Daly and Stone
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to health care; transferring the authority to
establish and administer a program of all-inclusive care for
the elderly from the Aging and Disability Services Division
of the Department of Health and Human Services to the
Department; requiring the Department to establish such a
program; requiring the Community Advocate within the
Division to provide certain services relating to the program;
making an appropriation; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing federal law authorizes a state to establish a program, commonly
known as a program of all-inclusive care for the elderly or PACE program, to
provide services to certain recipients of Medicare and Medicaid who are 55 years of
age or older. (42 U.S.C. §§ 1395eee, 1396u-4) Existing state law authorizes the
Aging and Disability Services Division of the Department of Health and Human
Services to establish and administer a PACE program. (NRS 427A.255, 427A.260)
Sections 2 and 8 of this bill eliminate the authority of the Division to establish
a PACE program, and sections 2-4 of this bill remove references in existing law to
such a PACE program. Instead, section 1 of this bill requires the Department
through any of its divisions to establish and administer a PACE program. Section 6
of this bill makes a conforming change to require the Director of the Department to
administer the provisions of section 1 in the same manner as the provisions of
existing law governing Medicaid and certain other programs administered by the
Department.
Existing law: (1) creates the Office of the Community Advocate within the
Division; and (2) requires the Community Advocate to assist in coordinating
resources and services available to aging persons within their respective
communities, including any PACE program established by the Division. (NRS
427A.300, 427A.310) Section 4 replaces the reference to the PACE program
established by the Division with a reference to the PACE program established by
the Department pursuant to section 1, thereby requiring the Community Advocate
to provide assistance related to that PACE program. Sections 5 and 7 of this bill
make conforming changes so that the PACE program created by section 1 is treated
similarly to any PACE program that would have been created under the authority
eliminated by section 8 for purposes relating to: (1) the division of the community
income, assets and obligations of a married couple into separate income for the
purpose of qualifying for such a program; and (2) activities of a home care
program, which is a program, including a PACE program, established by a state
agency or a local government which provides in the home personal care services,
personal assistance or temporary respite services to elderly persons or persons with
disabilities. Section 7.5 of this bill appropriates money to and authorizes
expenditures by the Division of Health Care Financing and Policy of the
Department to pay the costs of establishing and administering the PACE program.

Sec. 5. NRS 123.259 is hereby amended to read as follows:
123.259 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2, a
court of competent jurisdiction may, upon a proper petition filed by
a spouse or the guardian of a spouse, enter a decree dividing the
income and resources of a married couple pursuant to this section if
one spouse is an institutionalized spouse and the other spouse is a
community spouse.
2. The court shall not enter such a decree if the division is
contrary to a premarital agreement between the spouses which is
enforceable pursuant to chapter 123A of NRS.
3. Unless modified pursuant to subsection 4 or 5, the court may
divide the income and resources:
(a) Equally between the spouses; or
(b) By protecting income for the community spouse through
application of the maximum federal minimum monthly maintenance
needs allowance set forth in 42 U.S.C. § 1396r-5(d)(3)(C) and by
permitting a transfer of resources to the community spouse an
amount which does not exceed the amount set forth in 42 U.S.C. §
1396r-5(f)(2)(A)(ii).
4. If either spouse establishes that the community spouse needs
income greater than that otherwise provided under paragraph (b) of
subsection 3, upon finding exceptional circumstances resulting in
significant financial duress and setting forth in writing the reasons
for that finding, the court may enter an order for support against the
institutionalized spouse for the support of the community spouse in
an amount adequate to provide such additional income as is
necessary.
5. If either spouse establishes that a transfer of resources to the
community spouse pursuant to paragraph (b) of subsection 3, in
relation to the amount of income generated by such a transfer, is
inadequate to raise the income of the community spouse to the
amount allowed under paragraph (b) of subsection 3 or an order for
support issued pursuant to subsection 4, the court may substitute an
amount of resources adequate to provide income to fund the amount
so allowed or to fund the order for support.

modify the order.
7. A person may enter into a written agreement with his or her
spouse dividing their community income, assets and obligations into
equal shares of separate income, assets and obligations of the
spouses. Such an agreement is effective only if one spouse is an
institutionalized spouse and the other spouse is a community spouse
or a division of the income or resources would allow one spouse to
qualify for services under NRS 427A.250 to 427A.280, inclusive [.]
, or section 1 of this act.
8. An agreement entered into or decree entered pursuant to this
section may not be binding on the Division of Welfare and
