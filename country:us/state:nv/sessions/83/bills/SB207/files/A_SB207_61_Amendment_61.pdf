EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; transferring the authority to establish and
administer a program of all-inclusive care for the elderly from the
Aging and Disability Services Division of the Department of Health
and Human Services to the Department; requiring the Department to
establish such a program; requiring the Community Advocate within
the Division to provide certain services relating to the program; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing federal law authorizes a state to establish a program, commonly known as a
2 program of all-inclusive care for the elderly or PACE program, to provide services to certain
3 recipients of Medicare and Medicaid who are 55 years of age or older. (42 U.S.C. §§ 1395eee,
4 1396u-4) Existing state law authorizes the Aging and Disability Services Division of the
5 Department of Health and Human Services to establish and administer a PACE program.
6 (NRS 427A.255, 427A.260)
7 Sections 2 and 8 of this bill eliminate the authority of the Division to establish a PACE
8 program, and sections 2-4 of this bill remove references in existing law to such a PACE
9 program. Instead, section 1 of this bill requires the Department through any of its divisions to
10 establish and administer a PACE program . [that utilizes federally-qualified health centers to
11 provide services to persons enrolled in the PACE program.] Section 6 of this bill makes a
12 conforming change to require the Director of the Department to administer the provisions of
13 section 1 in the same manner as the provisions of existing law governing Medicaid and
14 certain other programs administered by the Department.
15 Existing law: (1) creates the Office of the Community Advocate within the Division; and
16 (2) requires the Community Advocate to assist in coordinating resources and services
17 available to aging persons within their respective communities, including any PACE program
18 established by the Division. (NRS 427A.300, 427A.310) Section 4 replaces the reference to
19 the PACE program established by the Division with a reference to the PACE program
20 established by the Department pursuant to section 1, thereby requiring the Community
21 Advocate to provide assistance related to that PACE program. Sections 5 and 7 of this bill
22 make conforming changes so that the PACE program created by section 1 is treated similarly
23 to any PACE program that would have been created under the authority eliminated by section
24 8 for purposes relating to: (1) the division of the community income, assets and obligations of
25 a married couple into separate income for the purpose of qualifying for such a program; and

Senate Amendment No. 61 to Senate Bill No. 207 Page 4
26 (2) activities of a home care program, which is a program, including a PACE program,
27 established by a state agency or a local government which provides in the home personal care
28 services, personal assistance or temporary respite services to elderly persons or persons with
29 disabilities.

30 Sec. 5. NRS 123.259 is hereby amended to read as follows:
31 123.259 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2, a court of
32 competent jurisdiction may, upon a proper petition filed by a spouse or the guardian
33 of a spouse, enter a decree dividing the income and resources of a married couple
34 pursuant to this section if one spouse is an institutionalized spouse and the other
35 spouse is a community spouse.
36 2. The court shall not enter such a decree if the division is contrary to a
37 premarital agreement between the spouses which is enforceable pursuant to chapter
38 123A of NRS.
39 3. Unless modified pursuant to subsection 4 or 5, the court may divide the

51 support against the institutionalized spouse for the support of the community
52 spouse in an amount adequate to provide such additional income as is necessary.

Senate Amendment No. 61 to Senate Bill No. 207 Page 6
1 5. If either spouse establishes that a transfer of resources to the community
2 spouse pursuant to paragraph (b) of subsection 3, in relation to the amount of
3 income generated by such a transfer, is inadequate to raise the income of the
4 community spouse to the amount allowed under paragraph (b) of subsection 3 or an
5 order for support issued pursuant to subsection 4, the court may substitute an
6 amount of resources adequate to provide income to fund the amount so allowed or
7 to fund the order for support.
8 6. A copy of a petition for relief under subsection 4 or 5 and any court order
9 issued pursuant to such a petition must be served on the Administrator of the

12 behalf of an institutionalized spouse. The Administrator may intervene no later than
13 45 days after receipt by the Division of Welfare and Supportive Services of the
14 Department of Health and Human Services of an application for medical assistance
15 and a copy of the petition and any order entered pursuant to subsection 4 or 5, and
16 may move to modify the order.
17 7. A person may enter into a written agreement with his or her spouse
18 dividing their community income, assets and obligations into equal shares of
19 separate income, assets and obligations of the spouses. Such an agreement is
20 effective only if one spouse is an institutionalized spouse and the other spouse is a
21 community spouse or a division of the income or resources would allow one spouse
22 to qualify for services under NRS 427A.250 to 427A.280, inclusive [.] , or section
23 1 of this act.
24 8. An agreement entered into or decree entered pursuant to this section may
25 not be binding on the Division of Welfare and Supportive Services of the
26 Department of Health and Human Services in making determinations under the
27 State Plan for Medicaid.
28 9. As used in this section, “community spouse” and “institutionalized spouse”
29 have the meanings respectively ascribed to them in 42 U.S.C. § 1396r-5(h).
