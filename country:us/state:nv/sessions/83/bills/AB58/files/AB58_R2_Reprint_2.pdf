Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law defines certain terms for the purposes of provisions relating to
2 gaming. (NRS 463.013-463.01967) Section 4 of this bill adds a person who sells
3 and provides management, or consultation or instruction in the management, of
4 risks associated with wagering pools for a race or sporting event or any other event
5 for which a wager may be accepted to the definition of the term “information
6 service.”
7 Existing law defines a “restricted license” as a state gaming license to operate
8 not more than 15 slot machines at an establishment in which the operation of slot
9 machines is incidental to the primary business of the establishment. Existing law
10 also provides that, in a county whose population is 100,000 or more (currently
11 Clark and Washoe Counties), a restricted license may only be granted at certain
12 establishments if the establishment contains: (1) a minimum of 2,500 square feet of
-
*AB58_R2*

– 2 –
13 space available for patrons; (2) a permanent, physical bar; and (3) a restaurant
14 which meets certain requirements. (NRS 463.0189, 463.161) Section 5.5 of this bill
15 clarifies that the minimum of 2,500 square feet of space available for patrons must
16 be indoor space.
17 Existing law: (1) prohibits, in general, a gaming licensee from offering a game
18 or gambling game for play if the game or gambling game has not received a
19 recommendation from the Nevada Gaming Control Board or an approval from the
20 Nevada Gaming Commission; and (2) requires the Commission to adopt
21 regulations governing the approval of games or gambling games. (NRS 463.164)
22 Section 6 of this bill instead prohibits a gaming licensee from offering a game or
23 gambling game for play if the game or gambling game has not been
24 administratively approved by the Chair of the Board in accordance with regulations
25 adopted by the Commission governing such administrative approval. Section 2 of
26 this bill makes a conforming change to refer to such regulations and administrative
27 approval of a game or gambling game.
28 Existing law prohibits the Commission from approving a license for an
29 establishment to operate interactive gaming unless certain conditions are met. (NRS
30 463.750) Section 8 of this bill makes a technical correction to refer to a race book
31 and sports pool for purposes of such licensure.
32 Existing law authorizes the Commission to provide by regulation for the
33 licensing of service providers, who generally: (1) perform certain services on behalf
34 of another licensed person who conducts nonrestricted gaming operations or an
35 establishment licensed to operate interactive gaming; or (2) provide services or
36 devices which patrons of licensed establishments use to obtain cash or wagering
37 instruments. (NRS 463.01395, 463.0157, 463.160, 463.677) Section 11 of this bill
38 repeals the term “cash access and wagering instrument service provider.” Sections
39 3, 5 and 7 of this bill make conforming changes to remove provisions of existing
40 law relating to cash access and wagering instrument service providers. Section 7
41 also removes system-based and system-supported games from the list of certain
42 games that may be exposed by licensed gaming establishments.
43 Existing law requires the Commission to adopt regulations relating to global
44 risk management, which is defined as the operation, by a person who has been
45 issued a license to operate a race book or sports pool, of certain risk management
46 services between and among various jurisdictions through communications
47 technology for the purposes of the management, or consultation or instruction in the
48 management, of wagering pools and the transmission of information relating to
49 wagering pools or other similar information. (NRS 463.810, 463.820) Section 11
50 repeals the provisions of existing law governing global risk management, and
51 section 4 adds certain activities previously included in the definition of “global risk
52 management” to the definition of “information service.” Sections 9 and 10 of this
53 bill make conforming changes to remove references to global risk management in
54 existing law.
