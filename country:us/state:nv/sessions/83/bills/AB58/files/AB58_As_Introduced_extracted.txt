Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law defines certain terms for the purposes of provisions relating to
2 gaming. (NRS 463.013-463.01967) Section 1 of this bill removes dice, playing
3 cards and devices for weighing or counting money from the definition of the term
4 “associated equipment.” Section 4 of this bill adds a person who sells and provides
5 management, or consultation or instruction in the management, of risks associated
6 with wagering pools for a race or sporting event or any other event for which a
7 wager may be accepted to the definition of the term “information service.”
8 Existing law: (1) prohibits, in general, a gaming licensee from offering a game
9 or gambling game for play if the game or gambling game has not received a
10 recommendation from the Nevada Gaming Control Board or an approval from the
11 Nevada Gaming Commission; and (2) requires the Commission to adopt
12 regulations governing the approval of games or gambling games. (NRS 463.164)
13 Section 6 of this bill instead prohibits a gaming licensee from offering a game or

14 gambling game for play if the game or gambling game has not been
15 administratively approved by the Chair of the Board in accordance with regulations
16 adopted by the Commission governing such administrative approval. Section 2 of
17 this bill makes a conforming change to refer to such regulations and administrative
18 approval of a game or gambling game.
19 Existing law prohibits the Commission from approving a license for an
20 establishment to operate interactive gaming unless certain conditions are met. (NRS
21 463.750) Section 8 of this bill makes a technical correction to refer to a race book
22 and sports pool for purposes of such licensure.
23 Existing law authorizes the Commission to provide by regulation for the
24 licensing of service providers, who generally: (1) perform certain services on behalf
25 of another licensed person who conducts nonrestricted gaming operations or an
26 establishment licensed to operate interactive gaming; or (2) provide services or
27 devices which patrons of licensed establishments use to obtain cash or wagering
28 instruments. (NRS 463.01395, 463.0157, 463.160, 463.677) Section 11 of this bill
29 repeals the term “cash access and wagering instrument service provider.” Sections
30 3, 5 and 7 of this bill make conforming changes to remove provisions of existing
31 law relating to cash access and wagering instrument service providers. Section 7
32 also removes system-based and system-supported games from the list of certain
33 games that may be exposed by licensed gaming establishments.
34 Existing law requires the Commission to adopt regulations relating to global
35 risk management, which is defined as the operation, by a person who has been
36 issued a license to operate a race book or sports pool, of certain risk management
37 services between and among various jurisdictions through communications
38 technology for the purposes of the management, or consultation or instruction in the
39 management, of wagering pools and the transmission of information relating to
40 wagering pools or other similar information. (NRS 463.810, 463.820) Section 11
41 repeals the provisions of existing law governing global risk management, and
42 section 4 adds certain activities previously included in the definition of “global risk
43 management” to the definition of “information service.” Sections 9 and 10 of this
44 bill make conforming changes to remove references to global risk management in
45 existing law.

(ON BEHALF OF THE NEVADA GAMING CONTROL BOARD)
PREFILED NOVEMBER 20, 2024

(BDR 41-297)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to gaming; revising the definitions of certain
terms related to gaming; providing for the administrative
approval of games or gambling games by the Chair of the
Nevada Gaming Control Board; revising the types of
games that may be exposed by gaming establishments;
making a technical correction to refer to a race book and
sports pool for the purposes of licensing an establishment
to operate interactive gaming; removing and repealing
provisions governing cash access and wagering
instrument service providers; removing and repealing
provisions governing global risk management; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law defines certain terms for the purposes of provisions relating to
2 gaming. (NRS 463.013-463.01967) Section 1 of this bill removes dice, playing
3 cards and devices for weighing or counting money from the definition of the term
4 “associated equipment.” Section 4 of this bill adds a person who sells and provides
5 management, or consultation or instruction in the management, of risks associated
6 with wagering pools for a race or sporting event or any other event for which a
7 wager may be accepted to the definition of the term “information service.”
8 Existing law: (1) prohibits, in general, a gaming licensee from offering a game
9 or gambling game for play if the game or gambling game has not received a
10 recommendation from the Nevada Gaming Control Board or an approval from the
11 Nevada Gaming Commission; and (2) requires the Commission to adopt
12 regulations governing the approval of games or gambling games. (NRS 463.164)
13 Section 6 of this bill instead prohibits a gaming licensee from offering a game or
-
*AB58*

– 2 –
14 gambling game for play if the game or gambling game has not been
15 administratively approved by the Chair of the Board in accordance with regulations
16 adopted by the Commission governing such administrative approval. Section 2 of
17 this bill makes a conforming change to refer to such regulations and administrative
18 approval of a game or gambling game.
19 Existing law prohibits the Commission from approving a license for an
20 establishment to operate interactive gaming unless certain conditions are met. (NRS
21 463.750) Section 8 of this bill makes a technical correction to refer to a race book
22 and sports pool for purposes of such licensure.
23 Existing law authorizes the Commission to provide by regulation for the
24 licensing of service providers, who generally: (1) perform certain services on behalf
25 of another licensed person who conducts nonrestricted gaming operations or an
26 establishment licensed to operate interactive gaming; or (2) provide services or
27 devices which patrons of licensed establishments use to obtain cash or wagering
28 instruments. (NRS 463.01395, 463.0157, 463.160, 463.677) Section 11 of this bill
29 repeals the term “cash access and wagering instrument service provider.” Sections
30 3, 5 and 7 of this bill make conforming changes to remove provisions of existing
31 law relating to cash access and wagering instrument service providers. Section 7
32 also removes system-based and system-supported games from the list of certain
33 games that may be exposed by licensed gaming establishments.
34 Existing law requires the Commission to adopt regulations relating to global
35 risk management, which is defined as the operation, by a person who has been
36 issued a license to operate a race book or sports pool, of certain risk management
37 services between and among various jurisdictions through communications
38 technology for the purposes of the management, or consultation or instruction in the
39 management, of wagering pools and the transmission of information relating to
40 wagering pools or other similar information. (NRS 463.810, 463.820) Section 11
41 repeals the provisions of existing law governing global risk management, and
42 section 4 adds certain activities previously included in the definition of “global risk
43 management” to the definition of “information service.” Sections 9 and 10 of this
44 bill make conforming changes to remove references to global risk management in
45 existing law.
