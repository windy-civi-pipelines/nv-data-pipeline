Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law defines certain terms for the purposes of provisions relating to
gaming. (NRS 463.013-463.01967) Section 4 of this bill adds a person who sells
and provides management, or consultation or instruction in the management, of
risks associated with wagering pools for a race or sporting event or any other event
for which a wager may be accepted to the definition of the term “information
service.”
Existing law defines a “restricted license” as a state gaming license to operate
not more than 15 slot machines at an establishment in which the operation of slot
machines is incidental to the primary business of the establishment. Existing law
also provides that, in a county whose population is 100,000 or more (currently
Clark and Washoe Counties), a restricted license may only be granted at certain
establishments if the establishment contains: (1) a minimum of 2,500 square feet of
space available for patrons; (2) a permanent, physical bar; and (3) a restaurant
which meets certain requirements. (NRS 463.0189, 463.161) Section 5.5 of this bill
clarifies that the minimum of 2,500 square feet of space available for patrons must
be indoor space.
Existing law: (1) prohibits, in general, a gaming licensee from offering a game
or gambling game for play if the game or gambling game has not received a
recommendation from the Nevada Gaming Control Board or an approval from the
Nevada Gaming Commission; and (2) requires the Commission to adopt
regulations governing the approval of games or gambling games. (NRS 463.164)

Section 2:
Section 6 of this bill instead prohibits a gaming licensee from offering a game or
gambling game for play if the game or gambling game has not been
administratively approved by the Chair of the Board in accordance with regulations
adopted by the Commission governing such administrative approval. Section 2 of
this bill makes a conforming change to refer to such regulations and administrative
approval of a game or gambling game.
Existing law prohibits the Commission from approving a license for an
establishment to operate interactive gaming unless certain conditions are met. (NRS

Section 3:
463.750) Section 8 of this bill makes a technical correction to refer to a race book
and sports pool for purposes of such licensure.
Existing law authorizes the Commission to provide by regulation for the
licensing of service providers, who generally: (1) perform certain services on behalf
-

– 2 –
of another licensed person who conducts nonrestricted gaming operations or an
establishment licensed to operate interactive gaming; or (2) provide services or
devices which patrons of licensed establishments use to obtain cash or wagering
instruments. (NRS 463.01395, 463.0157, 463.160, 463.677) Section 11 of this bill
repeals the term “cash access and wagering instrument service provider.” Sections
3, 5 and 7 of this bill make conforming changes to remove provisions of existing
law relating to cash access and wagering instrument service providers. Section 7
also removes system-based and system-supported games from the list of certain
games that may be exposed by licensed gaming establishments.
Existing law requires the Commission to adopt regulations relating to global
risk management, which is defined as the operation, by a person who has been
issued a license to operate a race book or sports pool, of certain risk management
services between and among various jurisdictions through communications
technology for the purposes of the management, or consultation or instruction in the
management, of wagering pools and the transmission of information relating to
wagering pools or other similar information. (NRS 463.810, 463.820) Section 11
repeals the provisions of existing law governing global risk management, and

Section 4:
section 4 adds certain activities previously included in the definition of “global risk
management” to the definition of “information service.” Sections 9 and 10 of this
bill make conforming changes to remove references to global risk management in
existing law.

Raw Text:
Assembly Bill No. 58–Committee on Judiciary
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to gaming; revising the definitions of certain
terms related to gaming; revising certain provisions
governing restricted licenses to operate gaming; providing for
the administrative approval of games or gambling games by
the Chair of the Nevada Gaming Control Board; revising the
types of games that may be exposed by gaming
establishments; making a technical correction to refer to a
race book and sports pool for the purposes of licensing an
establishment to operate interactive gaming; removing and
repealing provisions governing cash access and wagering
instrument service providers; removing and repealing
provisions governing global risk management; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law defines certain terms for the purposes of provisions relating to
gaming. (NRS 463.013-463.01967) Section 4 of this bill adds a person who sells
and provides management, or consultation or instruction in the management, of
risks associated with wagering pools for a race or sporting event or any other event
for which a wager may be accepted to the definition of the term “information
service.”
Existing law defines a “restricted license” as a state gaming license to operate
not more than 15 slot machines at an establishment in which the operation of slot
machines is incidental to the primary business of the establishment. Existing law
also provides that, in a county whose population is 100,000 or more (currently
Clark and Washoe Counties), a restricted license may only be granted at certain
establishments if the establishment contains: (1) a minimum of 2,500 square feet of
space available for patrons; (2) a permanent, physical bar; and (3) a restaurant
which meets certain requirements. (NRS 463.0189, 463.161) Section 5.5 of this bill
clarifies that the minimum of 2,500 square feet of space available for patrons must
be indoor space.
Existing law: (1) prohibits, in general, a gaming licensee from offering a game
or gambling game for play if the game or gambling game has not received a
recommendation from the Nevada Gaming Control Board or an approval from the
Nevada Gaming Commission; and (2) requires the Commission to adopt
regulations governing the approval of games or gambling games. (NRS 463.164)
Section 6 of this bill instead prohibits a gaming licensee from offering a game or
gambling game for play if the game or gambling game has not been
administratively approved by the Chair of the Board in accordance with regulations
adopted by the Commission governing such administrative approval. Section 2 of
this bill makes a conforming change to refer to such regulations and administrative
approval of a game or gambling game.
Existing law prohibits the Commission from approving a license for an
establishment to operate interactive gaming unless certain conditions are met. (NRS
463.750) Section 8 of this bill makes a technical correction to refer to a race book
and sports pool for purposes of such licensure.
Existing law authorizes the Commission to provide by regulation for the
licensing of service providers, who generally: (1) perform certain services on behalf
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 2 –
of another licensed person who conducts nonrestricted gaming operations or an
establishment licensed to operate interactive gaming; or (2) provide services or
devices which patrons of licensed establishments use to obtain cash or wagering
instruments. (NRS 463.01395, 463.0157, 463.160, 463.677) Section 11 of this bill
repeals the term “cash access and wagering instrument service provider.” Sections
3, 5 and 7 of this bill make conforming changes to remove provisions of existing
law relating to cash access and wagering instrument service providers. Section 7
also removes system-based and system-supported games from the list of certain
games that may be exposed by licensed gaming establishments.
Existing law requires the Commission to adopt regulations relating to global
risk management, which is defined as the operation, by a person who has been
issued a license to operate a race book or sports pool, of certain risk management
services between and among various jurisdictions through communications
technology for the purposes of the management, or consultation or instruction in the
management, of wagering pools and the transmission of information relating to
wagering pools or other similar information. (NRS 463.810, 463.820) Section 11
repeals the provisions of existing law governing global risk management, and
section 4 adds certain activities previously included in the definition of “global risk
management” to the definition of “information service.” Sections 9 and 10 of this
bill make conforming changes to remove references to global risk management in
existing law.
