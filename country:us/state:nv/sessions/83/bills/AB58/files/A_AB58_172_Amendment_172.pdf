Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law defines certain terms for the purposes of provisions relating to gaming.
2 (NRS 463.013-463.01967) [Section 1 of this bill removes dice, playing cards and devices for
3 weighing or counting money from the definition of the term “associated equipment.”] Section
4 4 of this bill adds a person who sells and provides management, or consultation or instruction
5 in the management, of risks associated with wagering pools for a race or sporting event or any
6 other event for which a wager may be accepted to the definition of the term “information
7 service.”
8 Existing law: (1) prohibits, in general, a gaming licensee from offering a game or
9 gambling game for play if the game or gambling game has not received a recommendation
10 from the Nevada Gaming Control Board or an approval from the Nevada Gaming
11 Commission; and (2) requires the Commission to adopt regulations governing the approval of
12 games or gambling games. (NRS 463.164) Section 6 of this bill instead prohibits a gaming
13 licensee from offering a game or gambling game for play if the game or gambling game has
14 not been administratively approved by the Chair of the Board in accordance with regulations
15 adopted by the Commission governing such administrative approval. Section 2 of this bill
16 makes a conforming change to refer to such regulations and administrative approval of a game
17 or gambling game.
18 Existing law prohibits the Commission from approving a license for an establishment to
19 operate interactive gaming unless certain conditions are met. (NRS 463.750) Section 8 of this
20 bill makes a technical correction to refer to a race book and sports pool for purposes of such
21 licensure.

Assembly Amendment No. 172 to Assembly Bill No. 58 Page 4
22 Existing law authorizes the Commission to provide by regulation for the licensing of
23 service providers, who generally: (1) perform certain services on behalf of another licensed
24 person who conducts nonrestricted gaming operations or an establishment licensed to operate
25 interactive gaming; or (2) provide services or devices which patrons of licensed
26 establishments use to obtain cash or wagering instruments. (NRS 463.01395, 463.0157,
27 463.160, 463.677) Section 11 of this bill repeals the term “cash access and wagering
28 instrument service provider.” Sections 3, 5 and 7 of this bill make conforming changes to
29 remove provisions of existing law relating to cash access and wagering instrument service
30 providers. Section 7 also removes system-based and system-supported games from the list of
31 certain games that may be exposed by licensed gaming establishments.
32 Existing law requires the Commission to adopt regulations relating to global risk
33 management, which is defined as the operation, by a person who has been issued a license to
34 operate a race book or sports pool, of certain risk management services between and among
35 various jurisdictions through communications technology for the purposes of the
36 management, or consultation or instruction in the management, of wagering pools and the
37 transmission of information relating to wagering pools or other similar information. (NRS
38 463.810, 463.820) Section 11 repeals the provisions of existing law governing global risk
39 management, and section 4 adds certain activities previously included in the definition of
40 “global risk management” to the definition of “information service.” Sections 9 and 10 of this
41 bill make conforming changes to remove references to global risk management in existing
42 law.
