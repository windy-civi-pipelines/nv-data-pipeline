operate gaming; providing for the administrative approval of games
or gambling games by the Chair of the Nevada Gaming Control Board;

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law defines certain terms for the purposes of provisions relating to gaming.
2 (NRS 463.013-463.01967) Section 4 of this bill adds a person who sells and provides
3 management, or consultation or instruction in the management, of risks associated with
4 wagering pools for a race or sporting event or any other event for which a wager may be
5 accepted to the definition of the term “information service.”
6 Existing law defines a “restricted license” as a state gaming license to operate not
7 more than 15 slot machines at an establishment in which the operation of slot machines
8 is incidental to the primary business of the establishment. Existing law also provides
9 that, in a county whose population is 100,000 or more (currently Clark and Washoe
10 Counties), a restricted license may only be granted at certain establishments if the
11 establishment contains: (1) a minimum of 2,500 square feet of space available for
12 patrons; (2) a permanent, physical bar; and (3) a restaurant which meets certain
13 requirements. (NRS 463.0189, 463.161) Section 5.5 of this bill clarifies that the minimum
14 of 2,500 square feet of space available for patrons must be indoor space.
15 Existing law: (1) prohibits, in general, a gaming licensee from offering a game or
16 gambling game for play if the game or gambling game has not received a recommendation
17 from the Nevada Gaming Control Board or an approval from the Nevada Gaming
18 Commission; and (2) requires the Commission to adopt regulations governing the approval of
19 games or gambling games. (NRS 463.164) Section 6 of this bill instead prohibits a gaming
20 licensee from offering a game or gambling game for play if the game or gambling game has
Senate Amendment No. 902 to Assembly Bill No. 58 First Reprint Page 4
21 not been administratively approved by the Chair of the Board in accordance with regulations
22 adopted by the Commission governing such administrative approval. Section 2 of this bill
23 makes a conforming change to refer to such regulations and administrative approval of a game
24 or gambling game.
25 Existing law prohibits the Commission from approving a license for an establishment to
26 operate interactive gaming unless certain conditions are met. (NRS 463.750) Section 8 of this
27 bill makes a technical correction to refer to a race book and sports pool for purposes of such
28 licensure.
29 Existing law authorizes the Commission to provide by regulation for the licensing of
30 service providers, who generally: (1) perform certain services on behalf of another licensed
31 person who conducts nonrestricted gaming operations or an establishment licensed to operate
32 interactive gaming; or (2) provide services or devices which patrons of licensed
33 establishments use to obtain cash or wagering instruments. (NRS 463.01395, 463.0157,
34 463.160, 463.677) Section 11 of this bill repeals the term “cash access and wagering
35 instrument service provider.” Sections 3, 5 and 7 of this bill make conforming changes to
36 remove provisions of existing law relating to cash access and wagering instrument service
37 providers. Section 7 also removes system-based and system-supported games from the list of
38 certain games that may be exposed by licensed gaming establishments.
39 Existing law requires the Commission to adopt regulations relating to global risk
40 management, which is defined as the operation, by a person who has been issued a license to
41 operate a race book or sports pool, of certain risk management services between and among
42 various jurisdictions through communications technology for the purposes of the
43 management, or consultation or instruction in the management, of wagering pools and the
44 transmission of information relating to wagering pools or other similar information. (NRS
45 463.810, 463.820) Section 11 repeals the provisions of existing law governing global risk
46 management, and section 4 adds certain activities previously included in the definition of
47 “global risk management” to the definition of “information service.” Sections 9 and 10 of this
48 bill make conforming changes to remove references to global risk management in existing
49 law.

(ON BEHALF OF THE NEVADA GAMING CONTROL BOARD)
PREFILED NOVEMBER 20, 2024
_______________
Referred to Committee on Judiciary
SUMMARY—Revises various provisions relating to gaming. (BDR 41-297)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to gaming; revising the definitions of certain terms related to
gaming; revising certain provisions governing restricted licenses to
operate gaming; providing for the administrative approval of games
or gambling games by the Chair of the Nevada Gaming Control Board;
revising the types of games that may be exposed by gaming
establishments; making a technical correction to refer to a race book
and sports pool for the purposes of licensing an establishment to
operate interactive gaming; removing and repealing provisions
governing cash access and wagering instrument service providers;
removing and repealing provisions governing global risk management;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law defines certain terms for the purposes of provisions relating to gaming.
2 (NRS 463.013-463.01967) Section 4 of this bill adds a person who sells and provides
3 management, or consultation or instruction in the management, of risks associated with
4 wagering pools for a race or sporting event or any other event for which a wager may be
5 accepted to the definition of the term “information service.”
6 Existing law defines a “restricted license” as a state gaming license to operate not
7 more than 15 slot machines at an establishment in which the operation of slot machines
8 is incidental to the primary business of the establishment. Existing law also provides
9 that, in a county whose population is 100,000 or more (currently Clark and Washoe
10 Counties), a restricted license may only be granted at certain establishments if the
11 establishment contains: (1) a minimum of 2,500 square feet of space available for
12 patrons; (2) a permanent, physical bar; and (3) a restaurant which meets certain
13 requirements. (NRS 463.0189, 463.161) Section 5.5 of this bill clarifies that the minimum
14 of 2,500 square feet of space available for patrons must be indoor space.
15 Existing law: (1) prohibits, in general, a gaming licensee from offering a game or
16 gambling game for play if the game or gambling game has not received a recommendation
17 from the Nevada Gaming Control Board or an approval from the Nevada Gaming
18 Commission; and (2) requires the Commission to adopt regulations governing the approval of
19 games or gambling games. (NRS 463.164) Section 6 of this bill instead prohibits a gaming
20 licensee from offering a game or gambling game for play if the game or gambling game has

Senate Amendment No. 902 to Assembly Bill No. 58 First Reprint Page 4
21 not been administratively approved by the Chair of the Board in accordance with regulations
22 adopted by the Commission governing such administrative approval. Section 2 of this bill
23 makes a conforming change to refer to such regulations and administrative approval of a game
24 or gambling game.
25 Existing law prohibits the Commission from approving a license for an establishment to
26 operate interactive gaming unless certain conditions are met. (NRS 463.750) Section 8 of this
27 bill makes a technical correction to refer to a race book and sports pool for purposes of such
28 licensure.
29 Existing law authorizes the Commission to provide by regulation for the licensing of
30 service providers, who generally: (1) perform certain services on behalf of another licensed
31 person who conducts nonrestricted gaming operations or an establishment licensed to operate
32 interactive gaming; or (2) provide services or devices which patrons of licensed
33 establishments use to obtain cash or wagering instruments. (NRS 463.01395, 463.0157,
34 463.160, 463.677) Section 11 of this bill repeals the term “cash access and wagering
35 instrument service provider.” Sections 3, 5 and 7 of this bill make conforming changes to
36 remove provisions of existing law relating to cash access and wagering instrument service
37 providers. Section 7 also removes system-based and system-supported games from the list of
38 certain games that may be exposed by licensed gaming establishments.
39 Existing law requires the Commission to adopt regulations relating to global risk
40 management, which is defined as the operation, by a person who has been issued a license to
41 operate a race book or sports pool, of certain risk management services between and among
42 various jurisdictions through communications technology for the purposes of the
43 management, or consultation or instruction in the management, of wagering pools and the
44 transmission of information relating to wagering pools or other similar information. (NRS
45 463.810, 463.820) Section 11 repeals the provisions of existing law governing global risk
46 management, and section 4 adds certain activities previously included in the definition of
47 “global risk management” to the definition of “information service.” Sections 9 and 10 of this
48 bill make conforming changes to remove references to global risk management in existing
49 law.
