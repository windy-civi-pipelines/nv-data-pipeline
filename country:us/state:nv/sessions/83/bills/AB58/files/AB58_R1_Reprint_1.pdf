Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law defines certain terms for the purposes of provisions relating to

8 or gambling game for play if the game or gambling game has not received a
9 recommendation from the Nevada Gaming Control Board or an approval from the
10 Nevada Gaming Commission; and (2) requires the Commission to adopt
11 regulations governing the approval of games or gambling games. (NRS 463.164)

15 adopted by the Commission governing such administrative approval. Section 2 of
16 this bill makes a conforming change to refer to such regulations and administrative
17 approval of a game or gambling game.
18 Existing law prohibits the Commission from approving a license for an
19 establishment to operate interactive gaming unless certain conditions are met. (NRS
20 463.750) Section 8 of this bill makes a technical correction to refer to a race book
21 and sports pool for purposes of such licensure.
22 Existing law authorizes the Commission to provide by regulation for the
23 licensing of service providers, who generally: (1) perform certain services on behalf
24 of another licensed person who conducts nonrestricted gaming operations or an
25 establishment licensed to operate interactive gaming; or (2) provide services or
26 devices which patrons of licensed establishments use to obtain cash or wagering
27 instruments. (NRS 463.01395, 463.0157, 463.160, 463.677) Section 11 of this bill
28 repeals the term “cash access and wagering instrument service provider.” Sections
29 3, 5 and 7 of this bill make conforming changes to remove provisions of existing
30 law relating to cash access and wagering instrument service providers. Section 7
31 also removes system-based and system-supported games from the list of certain
32 games that may be exposed by licensed gaming establishments.
33 Existing law requires the Commission to adopt regulations relating to global
34 risk management, which is defined as the operation, by a person who has been
35 issued a license to operate a race book or sports pool, of certain risk management
36 services between and among various jurisdictions through communications
37 technology for the purposes of the management, or consultation or instruction in the
38 management, of wagering pools and the transmission of information relating to
39 wagering pools or other similar information. (NRS 463.810, 463.820) Section 11
40 repeals the provisions of existing law governing global risk management, and
41 section 4 adds certain activities previously included in the definition of “global risk
42 management” to the definition of “information service.” Sections 9 and 10 of this
43 bill make conforming changes to remove references to global risk management in
44 existing law.
