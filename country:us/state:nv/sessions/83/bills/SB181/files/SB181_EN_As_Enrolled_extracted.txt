4. In computing the registration fee, the Department or its

against the registration fee due on the vehicle to which registration
is transferred.

portion of such a credit expires on the date the registration of the

Raw Text:
Senate Bill No. 181–Senator Cruz-Crawford
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to special license plates; providing for the
issuance of special license plates indicating support for
Nevada State University; exempting the special license plates
from certain provisions otherwise applicable to special
license plates; imposing a fee for the issuance and renewal of
such license plates; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law authorizes the issuance of various special license plates. (NRS
482.3672-482.37947) Section 1 of this bill requires the Department of Motor
Vehicles, in cooperation with Nevada State University, to design, prepare and issue
special license plates indicating support for Nevada State University. Section 1
requires a person wishing to obtain the special license plates to pay to the
Department: (1) a fee for initial issuance of $35 and a fee for renewal of $10; (2) all
applicable registration and license fees and governmental services taxes; and (3) an
additional fee for initial issuance of $25 and an additional fee for renewal of $20, to
be deposited with the State Treasurer who must, on a quarterly basis, distribute the
fees evenly to Nevada State University to support athletics programs and the
Nevada State University Foundation to operate a program to provide certain
necessary items to students, faculty and staff of the University. Section 1 authorizes
a person wishing to obtain the special license plates to request that the plates be
combined with personalized prestige plates if the person pays the additional fees for
the personalized prestige plates. Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change
to apply provisions relating to the issuance and renewal of a special license plate
for certain trailers to include the Nevada State University special license plate.
Section 5 of this bill prohibits the Department from issuing the Nevada State
University special license plate for a full trailer or semitrailer.
Under existing law, certain special license plates: (1) must be approved by the
Department; (2) are subject to a limitation on the number of separate designs of
special license plates which the Department may issue at any one time; and (3) may

Sec. 10. NRS 482.399 is hereby amended to read as follows:
482.399 1. Upon the transfer of the ownership of or interest
in any vehicle by any holder of a valid registration, or upon
destruction of the vehicle, the registration expires.
2. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 482.2155 and
subsection 3 of NRS 482.483, the holder of the original registration
may transfer the registration to another vehicle to be registered by

3. In computing the governmental services tax, the
Department, its agent or the registered dealer shall credit the portion
of the tax paid on the first vehicle attributable to the remainder of
the current registration period or calendar year on a pro rata monthly
basis against the tax due on the second vehicle or on any other
vehicle of which the person is the registered owner. If any person
transfers ownership or interest in two or more vehicles, the
Department or the registered dealer shall credit the portion of the tax
paid on all of the vehicles attributable to the remainder of the
current registration period or calendar year on a pro rata monthly
basis against the tax due on the vehicle to which the registration is
transferred or on any other vehicle of which the person is the
registered owner. The certificates of registration and unused license
plates of the vehicles from which a person transfers ownership or
interest must be submitted before credit is given against the tax due
on the vehicle to which the registration is transferred or on any other
vehicle of which the person is the registered owner.
4. In computing the registration fee, the Department or its
agent or the registered dealer shall credit the portion of the
registration fee paid on each vehicle attributable to the remainder of
the current calendar year or registration period on a pro rata basis
against the registration fee due on the vehicle to which registration
is transferred.
5. If the amount owed on the registration fee or governmental
services tax on the vehicle to which registration is transferred is less
than the credit on the total registration fee or governmental services
tax paid on all vehicles from which a person transfers ownership or
interest, the person may apply the unused portion of the credit to the
registration of any other vehicle owned by the person. Any unused
portion of such a credit expires on the date the registration of the
vehicle from which the person transferred the registration was due
to expire.
6. If the license plate or plates are not appropriate for the
second vehicle, the plate or plates must be surrendered to the
Department or registered dealer and an appropriate plate or plates
must be issued by the Department. The Department shall not reissue

governmental services tax paid on the vehicle attributable to the
remainder of the current calendar year or registration period on a pro
rata basis; or
(b) If the person does not qualify for a refund in accordance with
the provisions of subsection 9, issue to the person a credit in the
amount of the portion of the registration fee and governmental
services tax paid on the vehicle attributable to the remainder of the
current calendar year or registration period on a pro rata basis. Such
a credit may be applied by the person to the registration of any other
vehicle owned by the person. Any unused portion of the credit
expires on the date the registration of the vehicle from which the
person obtained a refund was due to expire.
9. The Department shall issue a refund pursuant to subsection 8
only if the request for a refund is made at the time the registration is
cancelled and the license plates are surrendered, the person
requesting the refund is a resident of Nevada, the amount eligible
for refund exceeds $100, and evidence satisfactory to the
Department is submitted that reasonably proves the existence of
extenuating circumstances. For the purposes of this subsection, the

license and has sold or otherwise disposed of his or her vehicle.
