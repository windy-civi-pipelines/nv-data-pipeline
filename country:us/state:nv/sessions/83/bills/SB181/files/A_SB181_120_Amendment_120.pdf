EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to [higher education;] special license plates; providing for the
issuance of special license plates indicating support for Nevada State
University; exempting the special license plates from certain
provisions otherwise applicable to special license plates; imposing a
fee for the issuance and renewal of such license plates; [making an
appropriation to the Nevada System of Higher Education to cover fees
for certain teachers to enroll in courses at institutions within the
system; making an appropriation to the Nevada System of Higher
Education to maintain the current level of fees for concurrent
enrollment courses for high school students;] and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the issuance of various special license plates. (NRS 482.3672-
2 482.37947) Section 1 of this bill requires the Department of Motor Vehicles, in cooperation
3 with Nevada State University, to design, prepare and issue special license plates indicating
4 support for Nevada State University. Section 1 requires a person wishing to obtain the special
5 license plates to pay to the Department: (1) a fee for initial issuance of $35 and a fee for
6 renewal of $10; (2) all applicable registration and license fees and governmental services
7 taxes; and (3) an additional fee for initial issuance of $25 and an additional fee for renewal of
8 $20, to be deposited with the State Treasurer who must, on a quarterly basis, distribute the
9 fees evenly to Nevada State University to support athletics programs and the Nevada State
10 University Foundation to operate a program to provide certain necessary items to students,
11 faculty and staff of the University. Section 1 authorizes a person wishing to obtain the special
12 license plates to request that the plates be combined with personalized prestige plates if the
13 person pays the additional fees for the personalized prestige plates. Section 2 of this bill
14 makes a conforming change to apply provisions relating to the issuance and renewal of a
15 special license plate for certain trailers to include the Nevada State University special license
16 plate. Section 5 of this bill prohibits the Department from issuing the Nevada State University
17 special license plate for a full trailer or semitrailer.
18 Under existing law, certain special license plates: (1) must be approved by the
19 Department; (2) are subject to a limitation on the number of separate designs of special license
20 plates which the Department may issue at any one time; and (3) may not be designed,

Senate Amendment No. 120 to Senate Bill No. 181 Page 4
21 prepared or issued by the Department unless a certain number of applications for the plates are
22 received. (NRS 482.367002, 482.367008, 482.36705) Sections 6-8 of this bill exempt from
23 such requirements the special license plates indicating support for Nevada State University.
24 Section 9 of this bill excludes the Nevada State University special license plates from the
25 definition of “special license plate” for purposes of existing provisions governing
26 investigations relating to finances of charitable organizations that receive additional fees from
27 special license plates. (NRS 482.38272-482.38279)
28 Section 3 of this bill prohibits a new vehicle dealer who is authorized to issue certificates
29 of registration from accepting an application for the registration of a motor vehicle if the
30 applicant wishes to obtain the Nevada State University special license plates.
31 Section 4 of this bill authorizes the Director of the Department to order the preparation of
32 sample license plates that are of the same design and size as the Nevada State University
33 special license plates.
34 Section 10 of this bill makes a conforming change to authorize the holder of the original
35 registration of any vehicle to transfer the registration and use of the Nevada State University
36 special license plates to another vehicle under certain circumstances.
37 Section 11 of this bill establishes a fee of $10 for the replacement of a Nevada State
38 University special license plate.
39 [Section 12 of this bill makes an appropriation to the Nevada System of Higher Education
40 to cover registration fees, laboratory fees and other mandatory fees for licensed teachers of
41 dual credit courses at public high schools in this State to enroll in certain courses at
42 institutions within the system.
43 Section 13 of this bill makes an appropriation to the Nevada System of Higher Education
44 to offset the cost of maintaining the current fee for concurrent enrollment courses for high
45 school students.]
