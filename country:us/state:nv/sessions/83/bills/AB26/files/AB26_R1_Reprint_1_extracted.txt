3 obstructions of waterways in the State of Nevada. (NRS 532.110, 532.120, chapter
4 535 of NRS) Section 1 of this bill exempts the State Engineer and any assistant of
5 the State Engineer from liability for damages caused by certain failures of a dam or
6 reservoir that may occur as a result of an inspection, emergency response or
7 enforcement of an order or regulation by the State Engineer or his or her assistant.

8 Under existing law, any person proposing to construct a dam in this State must
9 obtain a permit from the State Engineer to appropriate, store and use the water
10 impounded or diverted by the proposed dam before beginning construction and,
11 upon obtaining or possessing such a permit, must submit, in triplicate, to the State
12 Engineer for approval plans and specifications for certain dams. Existing law
13 further: (1) authorizes the State Engineer to inspect the construction of a dam at any
14 time for compliance with the approved plans and specifications; (2) prohibits the
15 construction and use of any dam, under certain circumstances, before the approval
16 of plans and specifications by the State Engineer; and (3) makes it a misdemeanor
17 to construct or use a dam without first obtaining such approval. (NRS 535.010)
18 Section 2 of this bill makes these provisions applicable to the reconstruction or
19 alteration of a dam. Section 2 also removes the requirement that any person
20 proposing to construct a dam in this State obtain a permit to appropriate, store and
21 use water impounded or diverted by the proposed dam before beginning
22 construction of the dam and instead requires any person proposing to construct,
23 reconstruct or alter a dam to obtain approval from the State Engineer before
24 beginning construction, reconstruction or alteration of the dam. Section 2 further:
25 (1) requires a person to submit plans and specifications to the State Engineer for
26 approval if the dam is classified by the State Engineer as a high hazard or
27 significant hazard dam; and (2) removes the requirement that such plans and
28 specifications be submitted in triplicate.
29 Under existing law, the State Engineer is authorized to impose certain
30 administrative fines for, or may seek injunctive relief upon, the violation of any
31 permit issued by the State Engineer relating to the construction, reconstruction or
32 alteration of a dam. (NRS 535.200, 535.210) Sections 8 and 9 of this bill authorize
33 the imposition of certain administrative fines or the seeking of injunctive relief
34 upon the violation of any approval issued by the State Engineer in conformity with
35 the removal of the requirement to obtain a permit made in section 2.
36 Under existing law, the State Engineer is required to file with the Board of
37 Wildlife Commissioners a copy of applications for approval of plans and
38 specifications for a new dam or for the alteration and enlargement of any dam in a
39 stream. (NRS 535.020) Section 3 of this bill instead requires the State Engineer to
40 notify the Department of Wildlife when an application for decommissioning a dam
41 is filed or a request for approval of plans and specifications of a new dam or for the
42 alteration and enlargement of any dam in a stream is submitted and to make the
43 application or plans and specifications available to the Department.
44 Under existing law, works constructed by the United States Bureau of
45 Reclamation or the United States Army Corps of Engineers are exempt from certain
46 requirements relating to dams, including requirements for the approval of plans and
47 specifications and inspections and safety and repair requirements. (NRS 535.010,
48 535.030) Sections 2 and 4 of this bill exempt any works under the jurisdiction of
49 the United States Bureau of Reclamation or the United States Army Corps of
50 Engineers from such requirements.
51 Under existing law, the State Engineer or any assistant or authorized agent of
52 the State Engineer is authorized to enter any land, at a reasonable hour, where a
53 dam or obstruction is situated to investigate and carry out the duties of the State
54 Engineer. (NRS 535.035) Section 5 of this bill further authorizes the State Engineer
55 or any assistant or authorized agent of the State Engineer to enter the land of any
56 parcel adjacent to where a dam or other obstruction is located as is necessary to
57 access the dam or other obstruction.
58 Under existing law, the State Engineer is authorized to order the removal of any
59 dam, diversion works or obstruction that has not been legally established by certain
60 means. If such a dam, diversion works or obstruction is ordered removed by the
61 State Engineer and is not removed after the service of a 30-day notice upon the
62 owner or person controlling the dam, diversion works or obstruction, or an appeal
-
*AB26_R1*
– 3 –
63 of the removal order has not been filed, the State Engineer may remove the dam,
64 diversion works or obstruction. (NRS 535.050) Section 6 of this bill authorizes the
65 State Engineer to remove a dam, diversion works or obstruction not legally
66 established after providing a written, not served, copy of the 30-day notice to the
67 owner of the dam, diversion works or obstruction.
68 Under existing law, the State Engineer is authorized to remove a beaver on
69 privately owned land if it is determined the beaver is interfering with the flow of
70 water to the detriment of water users and after service of a written notice on the
71 owner of the private land. (NRS 535.060) Section 7 of this bill requires that the
72 written notice be provided to the landowner and need not be served.

– 8 –
1 temporary restraining order issued ex parte or, after notice and
2 hearing, a preliminary or permanent injunction.

7 performance bond or other security to ensure compliance with the
8 court order within the period prescribed.
9 5. Any proceeding conducted or injunction or order issued

OF THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF
CONSERVATION AND NATURAL RESOURCES)

Referred to Committee on Natural Resources
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to dams. (BDR 48-261)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to water; exempting the State Engineer from
liability for certain damages resulting from the
performance of certain duties; revising provisions relating
to the construction, reconstruction or alteration of a dam;
exempting certain works under the jurisdiction of the
United States Bureau of Reclamation or the United States
Army Corps of Engineers from certain requirements
relating to dams; requiring that certain applications
relating to dams be made available to the Department of
Wildlife; authorizing the State Engineer to enter certain
parcels of land to access a dam or other obstruction;
revising provisions relating to the removal of any dam,
diversion works or obstruction; revising provisions
relating to the removal of certain animals interfering with
the flow of water; providing a penalty; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, the State Engineer is authorized to regulate the
2 construction, reconstruction, alteration and operation of dams and other
3 obstructions of waterways in the State of Nevada. (NRS 532.110, 532.120, chapter
4 535 of NRS) Section 1 of this bill exempts the State Engineer and any assistant of
5 the State Engineer from liability for damages caused by certain failures of a dam or
6 reservoir that may occur as a result of an inspection, emergency response or
7 enforcement of an order or regulation by the State Engineer or his or her assistant.

8 Under existing law, any person proposing to construct a dam in this State must
9 obtain a permit from the State Engineer to appropriate, store and use the water
10 impounded or diverted by the proposed dam before beginning construction and,
11 upon obtaining or possessing such a permit, must submit, in triplicate, to the State
12 Engineer for approval plans and specifications for certain dams. Existing law
13 further: (1) authorizes the State Engineer to inspect the construction of a dam at any
14 time for compliance with the approved plans and specifications; (2) prohibits the
15 construction and use of any dam, under certain circumstances, before the approval
16 of plans and specifications by the State Engineer; and (3) makes it a misdemeanor
17 to construct or use a dam without first obtaining such approval. (NRS 535.010)
18 Section 2 of this bill makes these provisions applicable to the reconstruction or
19 alteration of a dam. Section 2 also removes the requirement that any person
20 proposing to construct a dam in this State obtain a permit to appropriate, store and
21 use water impounded or diverted by the proposed dam before beginning
22 construction of the dam and instead requires any person proposing to construct,
23 reconstruct or alter a dam to obtain approval from the State Engineer before
24 beginning construction, reconstruction or alteration of the dam. Section 2 further:
25 (1) requires a person to submit plans and specifications to the State Engineer for
26 approval if the dam is classified by the State Engineer as a high hazard or
27 significant hazard dam; and (2) removes the requirement that such plans and
28 specifications be submitted in triplicate.
29 Under existing law, the State Engineer is authorized to impose certain
30 administrative fines for, or may seek injunctive relief upon, the violation of any
31 permit issued by the State Engineer relating to the construction, reconstruction or
32 alteration of a dam. (NRS 535.200, 535.210) Sections 8 and 9 of this bill authorize
33 the imposition of certain administrative fines or the seeking of injunctive relief
34 upon the violation of any approval issued by the State Engineer in conformity with
35 the removal of the requirement to obtain a permit made in section 2.
36 Under existing law, the State Engineer is required to file with the Board of
37 Wildlife Commissioners a copy of applications for approval of plans and
38 specifications for a new dam or for the alteration and enlargement of any dam in a
39 stream. (NRS 535.020) Section 3 of this bill instead requires the State Engineer to
40 notify the Department of Wildlife when an application for decommissioning a dam
