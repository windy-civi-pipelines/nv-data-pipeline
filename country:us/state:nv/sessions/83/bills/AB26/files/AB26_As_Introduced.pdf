2 construction, reconstruction, alteration and operation of dams and other
3 obstructions of waterways in the State of Nevada. (NRS 532.110, 532.120, chapter

– 2 –
7 response or enforcement of an order or regulation by the State Engineer or his or
8 her assistant or authorized agent.
9 Under existing law, any person proposing to construct a dam in this State must
10 obtain a permit from the State Engineer to appropriate, store and use the water
11 impounded or diverted by the proposed dam before beginning construction and,
12 upon obtaining or possessing such a permit, must submit, in triplicate, to the State
13 Engineer for approval plans and specifications for certain dams. Existing law
14 further: (1) authorizes the State Engineer to inspect the construction of a dam at any
15 time for compliance with the approved plans and specifications; (2) prohibits the
16 construction and use of any dam, under certain circumstances, before the approval
17 of plans and specifications by the State Engineer; and (3) makes it a misdemeanor
18 to construct or use a dam without first obtaining such approval. (NRS 535.010)
19 Section 2 of this bill makes these provisions applicable to the reconstruction or
20 alteration of a dam. Section 2 also removes the requirement that any person
21 proposing to construct a dam in this State obtain a permit to appropriate, store and
22 use water impounded or diverted by the proposed dam before beginning
23 construction of the dam and instead requires any person proposing to construct,
24 reconstruct or alter a dam to obtain approval from the State Engineer before
25 beginning construction, reconstruction or alteration of the dam. Section 2 further:
26 (1) requires a person to submit plans and specifications to the State Engineer for
27 approval if the dam is classified by the State Engineer as a high hazard or
28 significant hazard dam; and (2) removes the requirement that such plans and
29 specifications be submitted in triplicate.
30 Under existing law, the State Engineer is authorized to impose certain
31 administrative fines for, or may seek injunctive relief upon, the violation of any
32 permit issued by the State Engineer relating to the construction, reconstruction or
33 alteration of a dam. (NRS 535.200, 535.210) Sections 8 and 9 of this bill authorize
34 the imposition of certain administrative fines or the seeking of injunctive relief
35 upon the violation of any approval issued by the State Engineer in conformity with
36 the removal of the requirement to obtain a permit made in section 2.
37 Under existing law, the State Engineer is required to file with the Board of
38 Wildlife Commissioners a copy of applications for approval of plans and
39 specifications for a new dam or for the alteration and enlargement of any dam in a
40 stream. (NRS 535.020) Section 3 of this bill instead requires the State Engineer to
41 notify the Department of Wildlife when an application for decommissioning a dam
42 is filed or a request for approval of plans and specifications of a new dam or for the
43 alteration and enlargement of any dam in a stream is submitted and to make the
44 application or plans and specifications available to the Department.
45 Under existing law, works constructed by the United States Bureau of
46 Reclamation or the United States Army Corps of Engineers are exempt from certain
47 requirements relating to dams, including requirements for the approval of plans and
48 specifications and inspections and safety and repair requirements. (NRS 535.010,
49 535.030) Sections 2 and 4 of this bill exempt any works under the jurisdiction of
50 the United States Bureau of Reclamation or the United States Army Corps of
51 Engineers from such requirements.
52 Under existing law, the State Engineer or any assistant or authorized agent of
53 the State Engineer is authorized to enter any land, at a reasonable hour, where a
54 dam or obstruction is situated to investigate and carry out the duties of the State
55 Engineer. (NRS 535.035) Section 5 of this bill further authorizes the State Engineer
56 or any assistant or authorized agent of the State Engineer to enter the land of any
57 parcel adjacent to where a dam or other obstruction is located as is necessary to
58 access the dam or other obstruction.
59 Under existing law, the State Engineer is authorized to order the removal of any
60 dam, diversion works or obstruction that has not been legally established by certain
61 means. If such a dam, diversion works or obstruction is ordered removed by the
-

62 State Engineer and is not removed after the service of a 30-day notice upon the
63 owner or person controlling the dam, diversion works or obstruction, or an appeal
64 of the removal order has not been filed, the State Engineer may remove the dam,
65 diversion works or obstruction. (NRS 535.050) Section 6 of this bill authorizes the
66 State Engineer to remove a dam, diversion works or obstruction not legally
67 established after providing a written, not served, copy of the 30-day notice on the
68 owner of the dam, diversion works or obstruction.
69 Under existing law, the State Engineer is authorized to remove a beaver on
70 privately owned land if it is determined the beaver is interfering with the flow of
71 water to the detriment of water users and after service of a written notice on the
72 owner of the private land. (NRS 535.060) Section 7 of this bill requires that the
73 written notice be provided to the land owner and need not be served.
