FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to water; exempting the State Engineer from liability for certain
damages resulting from the performance of certain duties; revising
provisions relating to the construction, reconstruction or alteration of a
dam; exempting certain works under the jurisdiction of the United
States Bureau of Reclamation or the United States Army Corps of
Engineers from certain requirements relating to dams; requiring that
certain applications relating to dams be made available to the
Department of Wildlife; authorizing the State Engineer to enter certain
parcels of land to access a dam or other obstruction; revising
provisions relating to the removal of any dam, diversion works or
obstruction; revising provisions relating to the removal of certain
animals interfering with the flow of water; providing a penalty; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, the State Engineer is authorized to regulate the construction,
2 reconstruction, alteration and operation of dams and other obstructions of waterways in the
3 State of Nevada. (NRS 532.110, 532.120, chapter 535 of NRS) Section 1 of this bill exempts
4 the State Engineer and any assistant [or authorized agent] of the State Engineer from liability
5 for damages caused by certain failures of a dam or reservoir that may occur as a result of an
6 inspection, emergency response or enforcement of an order or regulation by the State
7 Engineer or his or her assistant . [or authorized agent.]
8 Under existing law, any person proposing to construct a dam in this State must obtain a
9 permit from the State Engineer to appropriate, store and use the water impounded or diverted
10 by the proposed dam before beginning construction and, upon obtaining or possessing such a
11 permit, must submit, in triplicate, to the State Engineer for approval plans and specifications
12 for certain dams. Existing law further: (1) authorizes the State Engineer to inspect the
13 construction of a dam at any time for compliance with the approved plans and specifications;
14 (2) prohibits the construction and use of any dam, under certain circumstances, before the
15 approval of plans and specifications by the State Engineer; and (3) makes it a misdemeanor to
Assembly Amendment No. 52 to Assembly Bill No. 26 Page 4
16 construct or use a dam without first obtaining such approval. (NRS 535.010) Section 2 of this
17 bill makes these provisions applicable to the reconstruction or alteration of a dam. Section 2
18 also removes the requirement that any person proposing to construct a dam in this State obtain
19 a permit to appropriate, store and use water impounded or diverted by the proposed dam
20 before beginning construction of the dam and instead requires any person proposing to
21 construct, reconstruct or alter a dam to obtain approval from the State Engineer before
22 beginning construction, reconstruction or alteration of the dam. Section 2 further: (1) requires
23 a person to submit plans and specifications to the State Engineer for approval if the dam is
24 classified by the State Engineer as a high hazard or significant hazard dam; and (2) removes
25 the requirement that such plans and specifications be submitted in triplicate.
26 Under existing law, the State Engineer is authorized to impose certain administrative
27 fines for, or may seek injunctive relief upon, the violation of any permit issued by the State
28 Engineer relating to the construction, reconstruction or alteration of a dam. (NRS 535.200,
29 535.210) Sections 8 and 9 of this bill authorize the imposition of certain administrative fines
30 or the seeking of injunctive relief upon the violation of any approval issued by the State
31 Engineer in conformity with the removal of the requirement to obtain a permit made in
32 section 2.
33 Under existing law, the State Engineer is required to file with the Board of Wildlife
34 Commissioners a copy of applications for approval of plans and specifications for a new dam
35 or for the alteration and enlargement of any dam in a stream. (NRS 535.020) Section 3 of this
36 bill instead requires the State Engineer to notify the Department of Wildlife when an
37 application for decommissioning a dam is filed or a request for approval of plans and
38 specifications of a new dam or for the alteration and enlargement of any dam in a stream is
39 submitted and to make the application or plans and specifications available to the Department.
40 Under existing law, works constructed by the United States Bureau of Reclamation or the
41 United States Army Corps of Engineers are exempt from certain requirements relating to
42 dams, including requirements for the approval of plans and specifications and inspections and
43 safety and repair requirements. (NRS 535.010, 535.030) Sections 2 and 4 of this bill exempt
44 any works under the jurisdiction of the United States Bureau of Reclamation or the United
45 States Army Corps of Engineers from such requirements.
46 Under existing law, the State Engineer or any assistant or authorized agent of the State
47 Engineer is authorized to enter any land, at a reasonable hour, where a dam or obstruction is
48 situated to investigate and carry out the duties of the State Engineer. (NRS 535.035) Section 5
49 of this bill further authorizes the State Engineer or any assistant or authorized agent of the
50 State Engineer to enter the land of any parcel adjacent to where a dam or other obstruction is
51 located as is necessary to access the dam or other obstruction.
52 Under existing law, the State Engineer is authorized to order the removal of any dam,
53 diversion works or obstruction that has not been legally established by certain means. If such a
54 dam, diversion works or obstruction is ordered removed by the State Engineer and is not
55 removed after the service of a 30-day notice upon the owner or person controlling the dam,
56 diversion works or obstruction, or an appeal of the removal order has not been filed, the State
57 Engineer may remove the dam, diversion works or obstruction. (NRS 535.050) Section 6 of
58 this bill authorizes the State Engineer to remove a dam, diversion works or obstruction not
59 legally established after providing a written, not served, copy of the 30-day notice to the
60 owner of the dam, diversion works or obstruction.
61 Under existing law, the State Engineer is authorized to remove a beaver on privately
62 owned land if it is determined the beaver is interfering with the flow of water to the detriment
63 of water users and after service of a written notice on the owner of the private land. (NRS
64 535.060) Section 7 of this bill requires that the written notice be provided to the landowner
65 and need not be served.

25 injunction that the facts may warrant, including a temporary restraining order issued
26 ex parte or, after notice and hearing, a preliminary or permanent injunction.

28 is not a ground for denying a request for a temporary restraining order or
29 injunction.

31 security to ensure compliance with the court order within the period prescribed.
32 5. Any proceeding conducted or injunction or order issued pursuant to this

SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to dams. (BDR 48-261)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to water; exempting the State Engineer from liability for certain
damages resulting from the performance of certain duties; revising
provisions relating to the construction, reconstruction or alteration of a
dam; exempting certain works under the jurisdiction of the United
States Bureau of Reclamation or the United States Army Corps of
Engineers from certain requirements relating to dams; requiring that
certain applications relating to dams be made available to the
Department of Wildlife; authorizing the State Engineer to enter certain
parcels of land to access a dam or other obstruction; revising
provisions relating to the removal of any dam, diversion works or
obstruction; revising provisions relating to the removal of certain
animals interfering with the flow of water; providing a penalty; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, the State Engineer is authorized to regulate the construction,
2 reconstruction, alteration and operation of dams and other obstructions of waterways in the
3 State of Nevada. (NRS 532.110, 532.120, chapter 535 of NRS) Section 1 of this bill exempts
4 the State Engineer and any assistant [or authorized agent] of the State Engineer from liability
5 for damages caused by certain failures of a dam or reservoir that may occur as a result of an
6 inspection, emergency response or enforcement of an order or regulation by the State
7 Engineer or his or her assistant . [or authorized agent.]
8 Under existing law, any person proposing to construct a dam in this State must obtain a
9 permit from the State Engineer to appropriate, store and use the water impounded or diverted
10 by the proposed dam before beginning construction and, upon obtaining or possessing such a
11 permit, must submit, in triplicate, to the State Engineer for approval plans and specifications
12 for certain dams. Existing law further: (1) authorizes the State Engineer to inspect the
13 construction of a dam at any time for compliance with the approved plans and specifications;
14 (2) prohibits the construction and use of any dam, under certain circumstances, before the
15 approval of plans and specifications by the State Engineer; and (3) makes it a misdemeanor to

Assembly Amendment No. 52 to Assembly Bill No. 26 Page 4
16 construct or use a dam without first obtaining such approval. (NRS 535.010) Section 2 of this
17 bill makes these provisions applicable to the reconstruction or alteration of a dam. Section 2
18 also removes the requirement that any person proposing to construct a dam in this State obtain
19 a permit to appropriate, store and use water impounded or diverted by the proposed dam
20 before beginning construction of the dam and instead requires any person proposing to
21 construct, reconstruct or alter a dam to obtain approval from the State Engineer before
22 beginning construction, reconstruction or alteration of the dam. Section 2 further: (1) requires
23 a person to submit plans and specifications to the State Engineer for approval if the dam is
24 classified by the State Engineer as a high hazard or significant hazard dam; and (2) removes
25 the requirement that such plans and specifications be submitted in triplicate.
