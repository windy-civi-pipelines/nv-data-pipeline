Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Under existing law, the State Engineer is authorized to regulate the
construction, reconstruction, alteration and operation of dams and other
obstructions of waterways in the State of Nevada. (NRS 532.110, 532.120, chapter
535 of NRS) Section 1 of this bill exempts the State Engineer and any assistant of
the State Engineer from liability for damages caused by certain failures of a dam or
reservoir that may occur as a result of an inspection, emergency response or
enforcement of an order or regulation by the State Engineer or his or her assistant.
Under existing law, any person proposing to construct a dam in this State must
obtain a permit from the State Engineer to appropriate, store and use the water
impounded or diverted by the proposed dam before beginning construction and,
upon obtaining or possessing such a permit, must submit, in triplicate, to the State
Engineer for approval plans and specifications for certain dams. Existing law
further: (1) authorizes the State Engineer to inspect the construction of a dam at any
time for compliance with the approved plans and specifications; (2) prohibits the
construction and use of any dam, under certain circumstances, before the approval
of plans and specifications by the State Engineer; and (3) makes it a misdemeanor
to construct or use a dam without first obtaining such approval. (NRS 535.010)
Section 2 of this bill makes these provisions applicable to the reconstruction or
alteration of a dam. Section 2 also removes the requirement that any person
proposing to construct a dam in this State obtain a permit to appropriate, store and
use water impounded or diverted by the proposed dam before beginning
construction of the dam and instead requires any person proposing to construct,
reconstruct or alter a dam to obtain approval from the State Engineer before
beginning construction, reconstruction or alteration of the dam. Section 2 further:
(1) requires a person to submit plans and specifications to the State Engineer for
approval if the dam is classified by the State Engineer as a high hazard or
significant hazard dam; and (2) removes the requirement that such plans and
specifications be submitted in triplicate.
Under existing law, the State Engineer is authorized to impose certain
administrative fines for, or may seek injunctive relief upon, the violation of any
-

– 2 –
permit issued by the State Engineer relating to the construction, reconstruction or
alteration of a dam. (NRS 535.200, 535.210) Sections 8 and 9 of this bill authorize
the imposition of certain administrative fines or the seeking of injunctive relief
upon the violation of any approval issued by the State Engineer in conformity with
the removal of the requirement to obtain a permit made in section 2.
Under existing law, the State Engineer is required to file with the Board of
Wildlife Commissioners a copy of applications for approval of plans and
specifications for a new dam or for the alteration and enlargement of any dam in a
stream. (NRS 535.020) Section 3 of this bill instead requires the State Engineer to
notify the Department of Wildlife when an application for decommissioning a dam
is filed or a request for approval of plans and specifications of a new dam or for the
alteration and enlargement of any dam in a stream is submitted and to make the
application or plans and specifications available to the Department.
Under existing law, works constructed by the United States Bureau of
Reclamation or the United States Army Corps of Engineers are exempt from certain
requirements relating to dams, including requirements for the approval of plans and
specifications and inspections and safety and repair requirements. (NRS 535.010,
535.030) Sections 2 and 4 of this bill exempt any works under the jurisdiction of
the United States Bureau of Reclamation or the United States Army Corps of
Engineers from such requirements.
Under existing law, the State Engineer or any assistant or authorized agent of
the State Engineer is authorized to enter any land, at a reasonable hour, where a
dam or obstruction is situated to investigate and carry out the duties of the State
Engineer. (NRS 535.035) Section 5 of this bill further authorizes the State Engineer
or any assistant or authorized agent of the State Engineer to enter the land of any
parcel adjacent to where a dam or other obstruction is located as is necessary to
access the dam or other obstruction.
Under existing law, the State Engineer is authorized to order the removal of any
dam, diversion works or obstruction that has not been legally established by certain
means. If such a dam, diversion works or obstruction is ordered removed by the
State Engineer and is not removed after the service of a 30-day notice upon the
owner or person controlling the dam, diversion works or obstruction, or an appeal
of the removal order has not been filed, the State Engineer may remove the dam,
diversion works or obstruction. (NRS 535.050) Section 6 of this bill authorizes the
State Engineer to remove a dam, diversion works or obstruction not legally
established after providing a written, not served, copy of the 30-day notice to the
owner of the dam, diversion works or obstruction.
Under existing law, the State Engineer is authorized to remove a beaver on
privately owned land if it is determined the beaver is interfering with the flow of
water to the detriment of water users and after service of a written notice on the
owner of the private land. (NRS 535.060) Section 7 of this bill requires that the
written notice be provided to the landowner and need not be served.
