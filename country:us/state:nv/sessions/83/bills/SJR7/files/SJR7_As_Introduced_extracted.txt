SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION—Urging the Federal Government
to recognize the unsuitability of Yucca Mountain as the
site for a repository to store and dispose of spent nuclear
fuel and high-level radioactive waste.
1 WHEREAS, Since 1954, when the Atomic Energy Act was
2 passed by Congress, the Federal Government has been responsible
3 for the disposal of radioactive waste, yet few environmental
4 challenges have proven more daunting than the problems posed by
5 the disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste;
6 and
7 WHEREAS, In July 2002, despite seemingly inadequate standards
8 set by the Environmental Protection Agency and on the
9 recommendation of the Secretary of Energy, President Bush signed
10 legislation designating Yucca Mountain as a suitable site for the
11 nation’s only repository for spent nuclear fuel and high-level
12 radioactive waste without regard to the constant and vigorous
13 objections of the political leaders and residents of the State of
14 Nevada, and ignoring the underlying geologic isolation
15 requirements set by Congress; and
16 WHEREAS, The recommendation of Yucca Mountain was not
17 only premature but also flawed, especially given the Department of
18 Energy’s failure to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the
19 socioeconomic, environmental and public health and safety impacts,
-
*SJR7*
– 2 –
1 both within Nevada and within communities along national shipping
2 routes; and
3 WHEREAS, Not only is the proposed repository in one of the
4 most geologically active areas in the nation, but according to the
5 Agency for Nuclear Projects, it is “the only repository under
6 consideration in the world that is located above the water table, not
7 below it”; and
8 WHEREAS, Even if the risks related to geologic disposal are
9 ignored, the designation of Yucca Mountain is of particular concern
10 because of its location within an area rife with seismic and
11 hydrothermal activity and because of its proximity to numerous
12 fractures and earthquake faults, which could lead to underground
13 contamination; and
14 WHEREAS, As more problems are revealed, the Department of
15 Energy has gravitated from the concept of geologic isolation and
16 now is relying almost exclusively on “engineered barriers” to keep
17 radiological materials from migrating out of a repository and into
18 the environment, essentially ignoring the foundational
19 recommendation of the National Academy of Sciences that
20 manmade materials not be used to compensate for faulty geology or
21 hydrology; and
22 WHEREAS, The Department of Energy contends it is better to
23 have all nuclear waste at a single location rather than scattered
24 around the country, yet this contention is flawed because Yucca
25 Mountain will have limited capacity, contradicting the “one safe
26 site” idea; and
27 WHEREAS, The Department of Energy has stated that most of
28 the nation’s spent nuclear fuel is safely and securely stored at more
29 than 70 reactor sites across the country and that, for the foreseeable
30 future, the spent fuel can safely stay at the reactor sites until a
31 permanent disposal solution is determined by the federal
32 government; and
33 WHEREAS, The waste that would be shipped to Yucca Mountain
34 is located at more than 70 sites across 35 states and, if transported,
35 will impact at least 44 states and 703 counties; and
36 WHEREAS, A 2002 report from the Agency for Nuclear Projects
37 found that Nevada’s economy stands to lose upwards of $5.5 billion
38 annually as a result of the stigmatizing effects of the repository and
39 the transportation of nuclear waste through the State; and
40 WHEREAS, As early as 1986, the Department of Energy
41 acknowledged the potential for impacts to a tourism-dependent
42 economy, an issue of great concern in Nevada, stating “the potential
43 for adverse public perception of a repository and its associated
44 waste transportation could adversely affect the tourism industry”;
45 and

*SJR7*
– 3 –
1 WHEREAS, Nevada’s tourism industry generated nearly $91
2 billion in statewide economic activity and supported more than
3 386,000 jobs in 2022, which means any impacts that reduce the
4 number of visitors, especially to Las Vegas, would have major
5 economic consequences for this State; and
6 WHEREAS, The Las Vegas Valley is one of the fastest growing
7 areas in the nation, which further raises concerns because Yucca
8 Mountain is located just 90 miles northwest of the Valley; and
9 WHEREAS, In April 2011, Congress ended federal funding for
10 the Yucca Mountain site, pausing licensing activities for the
11 proposed repository indefinitely into the future; and
12 WHEREAS, As recently as April 2024, leaders at a hearing of the
13 House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Energy, Climate
14 and Grid Security pitched restarting the conversation on resuming
15 work towards opening the Yucca Mountain repository; and
16 WHEREAS, The Federal Government is not prepared to deal
17 with, or even fully aware of, the effects of the Yucca Mountain
18 project on society and this country; now, therefore, be it
19 RESOLVED BY THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF
20 NEVADA, JOINTLY, That the numerous hurdles, potential health and
21 safety issues, widespread economic impacts and logistical and
22 transportation challenges are cause for reconsidering Yucca
23 Mountain as the proposed site for a nuclear waste repository; and be
24 it further
25 RESOLVED, That Nevada has already borne more than its fair
26 share of this nation’s radioactive waste burdens, including, hosting
27 hundreds of nuclear weapons tests during the Cold War and hosting
28 the world’s largest low-level and mixed radioactive waste disposal
29 facility at the Nevada Test Site, which is also controlled by the
30 Department of Energy; and be it further
31 RESOLVED, That the issue of how to dispose of nuclear waste,
32 the deadliest substance known to mankind, is of great importance,
33 requiring decisions to be based on “sound science,” as was promised
34 Nevada and the nation in 2000, before it is put on the roads,
35 railways and waterways of this country; and be it further
36 RESOLVED, That with the abundance of safe, economical dry
37 storage facilities at existing reactor sites, there is no current spent
38 fuel emergency and nuclear power plants face no risk of shutdown,
39 the members of the 83rd Session of the Nevada Legislature hereby
40 urge President Trump and Congress and all involved agencies to
41 recognize the unsuitability of Yucca Mountain as the site for a
42 repository to store and dispose of spent nuclear fuel and high-level
43 radioactive waste; and be it further
