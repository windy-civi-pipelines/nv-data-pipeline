EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to water; revising the duration of time in which agricultural water
rights may be temporarily converted for certain purposes; providing
an exception to provisions relating to the forfeiture and
abandonment of a water right; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, a person or entity may apply to temporarily convert agricultural water
2 rights for wildlife purposes or to improve the quality or flow of water for a duration not to
3 exceed 3 years and a temporary conversion may be extended in increments not to exceed 3
4 years in duration each. (NRS 533.0243) [This] Section 1 of this bill instead provides that a
5 temporary conversion of agricultural water rights may not exceed [10] 5 years in duration and
6 may be extended in increments that may not exceed 5 years in duration each. Section 1: (1)
7 authorizes the State Engineer to deny an application to temporarily convert an
8 agricultural water right or limit the duration of a temporary conversion or an extension
9 of a temporary conversion; and (2) prohibits the State Engineer from approving an
10 application for a temporary conversion under certain circumstances. Section 1 further
11 provides that upon the expiration of a temporary conversion, the agricultural water
12 right must revert to the previous beneficial use.
13 Existing law requires, under certain circumstances, the State Engineer to notify the
14 owner of a water right that the owner has 1 year after the date of the notice to: (1) use
15 the water right beneficially and provide proof of such use to the State Engineer; or (2)
16 apply to the State Engineer for an extension of time to work a forfeiture of the water
17 right. If, after 1 year of the date of the notice, the owner fails to act, the State Engineer is
18 required to declare the right forfeited. Existing law also provides that a right to use
19 underground water may be lost by abandonment under certain circumstances. (NRS
20 534.090) Section 2 of this bill provides that these provisions relating to forfeiture and
21 abandonment do not apply to water rights which are subject to certain federal or state
22 programs.

6 accordance with the provisions of this section.
7 2. If a person or entity proposes to temporarily convert agricultural water

9 to this section, such temporary conversion:
10 (a) Must not be carried out unless the person or entity first applies for and
11 receives from the State Engineer any necessary permits or approvals required
12 pursuant to:
13 (1) The provisions of this chapter; and
14 (2) Any applicable decisions, orders, procedures and regulations of the

20 entity seeking the extension first applies for and receives from the State Engineer
21 any necessary permits or approvals, as described in paragraph (a).
22 3. The State Engineer:
23 (a) May deny an application to temporarily convert an agricultural water
24 right received pursuant to subsection 2 or limit the temporary conversion or
25 extension of the temporary conversion to any duration of less than 5 years if the
26 State Engineer determines that the temporary conversion or duration of the
27 temporary conversion would not meet the purposes set forth in subsection 1 or
28 would not otherwise be in the public interest; and
29 (b) Shall not approve an application to temporarily convert an agricultural
30 water right if the water right is a groundwater right and the owner has received
31 notice from the State Engineer pursuant to subsection 2 of NRS 534.090
32 indicating 4 or more consecutive years of nonuse.
33 4. If the State Engineer authorizes the temporary conversion of an
34 agricultural water right pursuant to this section, the temporarily converted water
35 right:
36 (a) Must not be considered a beneficial use for the purpose of perfecting the
37 water right or proving that beneficial use of the water right has resumed;
38 (b) Must not be claimed or considered a consumptive use for the purposes of
39 NRS 533.3703;
40 (c) Remains subject to the provisions of NRS 534.037 and any groundwater
41 management plan or modification thereto; and
42 (d) Remains subject to any order of the State Engineer requiring that
43 withdrawals be restricted to conform to priority rights.
44 5. Upon the expiration of the temporary conversion and any extension
45 granted pursuant to subsection 2, an agricultural water right that is temporarily
46 converted must revert to the existing beneficial use of the agricultural water right
47 before the water right was temporarily converted.
48 Sec. 2. NRS 534.090 is hereby amended to read as follows:

Assembly Amendment No. 49 to Assembly Bill No. 9 Page 5
1 534.090 1. Except as otherwise provided in this section, failure for 5
2 successive years after April 15, 1967, on the part of the holder of any right, whether
3 it is an adjudicated right, an unadjudicated right or a right for which a certificate has
4 been issued pursuant to NRS 533.425, and further whether the right is initiated after
5 or before March 25, 1939, to use beneficially all or any part of the underground
6 water for the purpose for which the right is acquired or claimed, works a forfeiture
7 of both undetermined rights and determined rights to the use of that water to the
8 extent of the nonuse.
9 2. If the records of the State Engineer or any other documents obtained by or
10 provided to the State Engineer indicate 4 or more consecutive years of nonuse of all
11 or any part of a water right which is governed by this chapter:
12 (a) The State Engineer shall notify the owner of the water right, as determined
13 in the records of the Office of the State Engineer, by registered or certified mail of
14 the nonuse and that the owner has 1 year after the date of the notice of nonuse in
15 which to use the water right beneficially and to provide proof of such use to the
16 State Engineer or apply for relief pursuant to subsection 3 to avoid forfeiting the
17 water right.
18 (b) If, after 1 year after the date of the notice of nonuse pursuant to paragraph
19 (a), proof of resumption of beneficial use is not filed in the Office of the State
20 Engineer, the State Engineer shall, unless the State Engineer has granted a request
21 to extend the time necessary to work a forfeiture of the water right, send a final
22 notice to the owner of the water right, as determined in the records of the Office of
23 the State Engineer, by registered or certified mail, that the water right is held for
24 forfeiture. If the owner of the water right, within 30 days after the date of such final
25 notice, fails to file the required proof of resumption of beneficial use or an
26 application for an extension of time to prevent forfeiture, the State Engineer shall
27 declare the right, or the portion of the right not returned to beneficial use, forfeited.
28 The State Engineer shall send notice of the declaration of forfeiture, by registered
29 or certified mail, to the owner of record, as determined in the records of the Office
30 of the State Engineer, of the water right that has been declared forfeited.
31 (c) If, after receipt of a notice of the declaration of forfeiture pursuant to
32 paragraph (b), the owner of record of the water right fails to appeal the ruling in the
33 manner provided for in NRS 533.450, and within the time provided for therein, the
34 forfeiture becomes final. Upon the forfeiture of the water right, the water reverts to
35 the public and is available for further appropriation, subject to existing rights.
36 3. The State Engineer may, upon the request of the holder of any right
37 described in subsection 1, extend the time necessary to work a forfeiture under
38 subsection 2 if the request is made before the expiration of the time necessary to
39 work a forfeiture. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 4, the State Engineer
40 may grant, upon request and for good cause shown, any number of extensions, but a
41 single extension must not exceed 1 year. In determining whether to grant or deny a
42 request, the State Engineer shall, among other reasons, consider:
43 (a) Whether the holder has submitted proof and evidence that the holder is
44 proceeding in good faith and with reasonable diligence to resume use of the water
45 beneficially for the purpose for which the holder’s right is acquired or claimed;
46 (b) The number of years during which the water has not been put to the
47 beneficial use for which the right is acquired or claimed;
48 (c) Any economic conditions or natural disasters which made the holder unable
49 to put the water to that use;
50 (d) Whether the water right is located in a basin within a county under a
51 declaration of drought by the Governor, United States Secretary of Agriculture or
52 the President of the United States;

Assembly Amendment No. 49 to Assembly Bill No. 9 Page 6
1 (e) Whether the holder has demonstrated efforts to conserve water which have
2 resulted in a reduction in water consumption;
3 (f) Whether the water right is located in a basin that has been designated as a
4 critical management area by the State Engineer pursuant to subsection 7 of NRS
5 534.110;
6 (g) The date of priority of the water right as it relates to the potential
7 curtailment of water use in the basin;
8 (h) The availability of water in the basin, including, without limitation, whether
9 withdrawals of water consistently exceed the perennial yield of the basin; and
10 (i) Any orders restricting use or appropriation of water in the basin.
11  The State Engineer shall notify, by registered or certified mail, the owner of the
12 water right, as determined in the records of the Office of the State Engineer, of
13 whether the State Engineer has granted or denied the holder’s request for an
14 extension pursuant to this subsection. If the State Engineer grants an extension
15 pursuant to this subsection and, before the expiration of that extension, proof of
16 resumption of beneficial use or another request for an extension is not filed in the
17 Office of the State Engineer, the State Engineer shall send a final notice to the
18 owner of the water right, by registered or certified mail, that the water right will be
19 declared forfeited if the owner of the water right fails to file the required proof of
20 resumption of beneficial use or an application for an extension of time to prevent
21 forfeiture within 30 days after the date of the final notice. If the owner of the water
22 right fails to file the required proof of resumption of beneficial use or an application
23 for an extension of time to prevent forfeiture within 30 days after the date of such
24 final notice, the State Engineer shall declare the water right, or the portion of the
25 right not returned to beneficial use, forfeited.
26 4. If the State Engineer grants an extension pursuant to subsection 1 in a
27 basin:
28 (a) Where withdrawals of groundwater consistently exceed the perennial yield
29 of the basin; or
30 (b) That has been designated as a critical management area by the State
31 Engineer pursuant to subsection 7 of NRS 534.110,
32  a single extension must not exceed 3 years, but any number of extensions may be
33 granted to the holder of such a right.
34 5. The failure to receive a notice pursuant to subsection 2 or 3 does not nullify
35 the forfeiture or extend the time necessary to work the forfeiture of a water right.
36 6. A right to use underground water whether it is vested or otherwise may be
37 lost by abandonment. If the State Engineer, in investigating a groundwater source,
38 upon which there has been a prior right, for the purpose of acting upon an
39 application to appropriate water from the same source, is of the belief from his or
40 her examination that an abandonment has taken place, the State Engineer shall so
41 state in the ruling approving the application. If, upon notice by registered or
42 certified mail to the owner of record who had the prior right, the owner of record of
43 the prior right fails to appeal the ruling in the manner provided for in NRS 533.450,
44 and within the time provided for therein, the alleged abandonment declaration as set
45 forth by the State Engineer becomes final.
46 7. The provisions of this section do not apply to a water right which is
47 subject to:
48 (a) A contract or agreement entered into in accordance with an official
49 federal program for the conservation of land or water; or
50 (b) An official program for the conservation of water that is administered by
51 an agency of this State.
