Section 1:
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to governmental administration; revising
provisions governing the prohibition against intentionally
feeding certain animals; prohibiting, with certain exceptions,
a person or any agent or employee of a person from
knowingly bringing into or possessing in this State the
excrement or bodily fluid of certain animals; revising
provisions governing certain civil penalties for unlawfully
killing or possessing certain big game mammals; revising
provisions relating to the importation, possession and
propagation of certain fallow deer or reindeer; providing
penalties; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Under existing law, the Board of Wildlife Commissioners is required to classify
all wildlife by regulation. (NRS 501.110) Existing law also, with certain
exceptions, prohibits a person from intentionally feeding a big game mammal
without written authorization from the Department. For the purpose of this
prohibition, “big game mammal” is defined to include a pronghorn antelope, black
bear, mule deer, mountain goat, mountain lion, Rocky Mountain elk and certain
subspecies of bighorn sheep. The penalties for violating this prohibition are: (1) a
written warning for a first offense; (2) a fine of not more than $250 for a second
offense; and (3) a fine of not more than $500 for a third or subsequent offense.
(NRS 501.382) Section 7 of this bill expands this prohibition to apply to: (1) the
intentional feeding of any wildlife that is classified as a wild mammal by
regulations adopted by the Board of Wildlife Commissioners; and (2) the taking of
any bird that is classified as a game bird by regulations adopted by the Board of
Wildlife Commissioners by baiting such a game bird or on or above an area that
was baited which the person knows or reasonably should have known was baited.

Section 2:
Section 1 of this bill makes a conforming change as a result of the expansion of the
prohibition to additional animals.
With certain exceptions, existing law prohibits a person or the person’s agent or
employee from knowingly bringing into or possessing in this State the carcass or
part of the carcass of certain animals. (NRS 501.3845) A person who violates this
prohibition is: (1) guilty of a misdemeanor, which is punished by a fine of not less
than $50 nor more than $500, or by imprisonment in the county jail for not more
than 6 months, or by both fine or imprisonment; and (2) liable for certain civil
penalties. (NRS 501.385, 501.3855) Section 8 of this bill also prohibits knowingly
bringing into or possessing in this State the excrement or bodily fluid of such
animals. Section 8 authorizes the seizure, destruction or removal from this State of
such excrement or bodily fluid in the same manner as a carcass or part of a carcass.
With certain exceptions and in addition to certain authorized penalties, existing
law establishes a civil penalty of not less than $5,000 nor more than $30,000 for
unlawfully killing or possessing a trophy big game mammal. For the purpose of this
civil penalty, a trophy big game mammal is defined as a mule deer with an outside
antler measurement of at least 24 inches, a bighorn sheep of any species with at
least one horn exceeding a half curl, a Rocky Mountain elk with at least six antler
points on one antler, a pronghorn antelope with at least one horn which is more
-

than 14 inches in length, a mountain goat or a black bear. Also, with certain
exceptions and in addition to certain authorized penalties, existing law establishes a
civil penalty of not less than $250 and not more than $5,000 for unlawfully killing
or possessing certain other animals, including a moose. (NRS 501.3855) Section 9
of this bill makes unlawfully killing or possessing a moose subject to the higher
civil penalty for trophy big game mammals of not less than $5,000 nor more than
$30,000. For the purposes of identifying a trophy big game mammal for imposition
of the higher civil penalty, existing law defines the term “antler point” to exclude
the first point on the main beam, commonly known as the eye guard, on mule deer.
(NRS 501.3855) Existing regulations interpret the exclusion to apply only to mule
deer. (NAC 502.1175) Section 9 codifies this interpretation in the Nevada Revised
Statutes.
Existing law: (1) prohibits any person without a permit from importing,
possessing or propagating alternative livestock, which is defined as any species or
subspecies of fallow deer or reindeer, if such animals are born and reared in
captivity and raised on private property to produce meat or other by-products or for
breeding stock; and (2) requires the State Board of Agriculture to adopt regulations
governing the permit program for alternative livestock. In adopting such
regulations, existing law requires the State Board of Agriculture to consult with the
Department of Wildlife and the Board of Wildlife Commissioners concerning the
provisions that are necessary to protect wildlife in this State and in certain areas of
special concern. (NRS 501.003, 576.129; NAC 576.100-576.260) A person who
violates this prohibition: (1) is guilty of a misdemeanor, which is punished by a fine
of not more than $1,000 or imprisonment in the county jail for not more than 6
months, or by both a fine and imprisonment; and (2) may be liable for a civil
penalty of not more than $5,000 for each violation. (NRS 193.150, 576.150)
Existing law, with certain exceptions, authorizes a person to bring an animal that is
not under special quarantine into this State in compliance with regulations adopted
by the State Quarantine Officer. (NRS 571.210) Section 25 of this bill eliminates
the permit program for alternative livestock, thereby making it a misdemeanor to
import, possess or propagate such fallow deer or reindeer in this State, unless
pursuant to the regulations adopted by the State Quarantine Officer that authorize
certain restricted entry of animals from outside this State. Sections 3, 6, 11-15, 17,
18, 20, 22-24 and 27 of this bill make conforming changes as a result of the
elimination of the permit program for alternative livestock by section 25. Section
26 of this bill declares void the regulations adopted by the State Board of
Agriculture governing the permit program for alternative livestock. Sections 5 and
10 of this bill make conforming changes to refer to provisions that have been
renumbered in section 3. Sections 19 and 21 of this bill make conforming changes
by removing references to sections defining “alternative livestock” that are repealed
in section 27.

Raw Text:
Assembly Bill No. 59–Committee on Natural Resources
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to governmental administration; revising
provisions governing the prohibition against intentionally
feeding certain animals; prohibiting, with certain exceptions,
a person or any agent or employee of a person from
knowingly bringing into or possessing in this State the
excrement or bodily fluid of certain animals; revising
provisions governing certain civil penalties for unlawfully
killing or possessing certain big game mammals; revising
provisions relating to the importation, possession and
propagation of certain fallow deer or reindeer; providing
penalties; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Under existing law, the Board of Wildlife Commissioners is required to classify
all wildlife by regulation. (NRS 501.110) Existing law also, with certain
exceptions, prohibits a person from intentionally feeding a big game mammal
without written authorization from the Department. For the purpose of this
prohibition, “big game mammal” is defined to include a pronghorn antelope, black
bear, mule deer, mountain goat, mountain lion, Rocky Mountain elk and certain
subspecies of bighorn sheep. The penalties for violating this prohibition are: (1) a
written warning for a first offense; (2) a fine of not more than $250 for a second
offense; and (3) a fine of not more than $500 for a third or subsequent offense.
(NRS 501.382) Section 7 of this bill expands this prohibition to apply to: (1) the
intentional feeding of any wildlife that is classified as a wild mammal by
regulations adopted by the Board of Wildlife Commissioners; and (2) the taking of
any bird that is classified as a game bird by regulations adopted by the Board of
Wildlife Commissioners by baiting such a game bird or on or above an area that
was baited which the person knows or reasonably should have known was baited.
Section 1 of this bill makes a conforming change as a result of the expansion of the
prohibition to additional animals.
With certain exceptions, existing law prohibits a person or the person’s agent or
employee from knowingly bringing into or possessing in this State the carcass or
part of the carcass of certain animals. (NRS 501.3845) A person who violates this
prohibition is: (1) guilty of a misdemeanor, which is punished by a fine of not less
than $50 nor more than $500, or by imprisonment in the county jail for not more
than 6 months, or by both fine or imprisonment; and (2) liable for certain civil
penalties. (NRS 501.385, 501.3855) Section 8 of this bill also prohibits knowingly
bringing into or possessing in this State the excrement or bodily fluid of such
animals. Section 8 authorizes the seizure, destruction or removal from this State of
such excrement or bodily fluid in the same manner as a carcass or part of a carcass.
With certain exceptions and in addition to certain authorized penalties, existing
law establishes a civil penalty of not less than $5,000 nor more than $30,000 for
unlawfully killing or possessing a trophy big game mammal. For the purpose of this
civil penalty, a trophy big game mammal is defined as a mule deer with an outside
antler measurement of at least 24 inches, a bighorn sheep of any species with at
least one horn exceeding a half curl, a Rocky Mountain elk with at least six antler
points on one antler, a pronghorn antelope with at least one horn which is more

than 14 inches in length, a mountain goat or a black bear. Also, with certain
exceptions and in addition to certain authorized penalties, existing law establishes a
civil penalty of not less than $250 and not more than $5,000 for unlawfully killing
or possessing certain other animals, including a moose. (NRS 501.3855) Section 9
of this bill makes unlawfully killing or possessing a moose subject to the higher
civil penalty for trophy big game mammals of not less than $5,000 nor more than
$30,000. For the purposes of identifying a trophy big game mammal for imposition
of the higher civil penalty, existing law defines the term “antler point” to exclude
the first point on the main beam, commonly known as the eye guard, on mule deer.
(NRS 501.3855) Existing regulations interpret the exclusion to apply only to mule
deer. (NAC 502.1175) Section 9 codifies this interpretation in the Nevada Revised
Statutes.
Existing law: (1) prohibits any person without a permit from importing,
possessing or propagating alternative livestock, which is defined as any species or
subspecies of fallow deer or reindeer, if such animals are born and reared in
captivity and raised on private property to produce meat or other by-products or for
breeding stock; and (2) requires the State Board of Agriculture to adopt regulations
governing the permit program for alternative livestock. In adopting such
regulations, existing law requires the State Board of Agriculture to consult with the
Department of Wildlife and the Board of Wildlife Commissioners concerning the
provisions that are necessary to protect wildlife in this State and in certain areas of
special concern. (NRS 501.003, 576.129; NAC 576.100-576.260) A person who
violates this prohibition: (1) is guilty of a misdemeanor, which is punished by a fine
of not more than $1,000 or imprisonment in the county jail for not more than 6
months, or by both a fine and imprisonment; and (2) may be liable for a civil
penalty of not more than $5,000 for each violation. (NRS 193.150, 576.150)
Existing law, with certain exceptions, authorizes a person to bring an animal that is
not under special quarantine into this State in compliance with regulations adopted
by the State Quarantine Officer. (NRS 571.210) Section 25 of this bill eliminates
the permit program for alternative livestock, thereby making it a misdemeanor to
import, possess or propagate such fallow deer or reindeer in this State, unless
pursuant to the regulations adopted by the State Quarantine Officer that authorize
certain restricted entry of animals from outside this State. Sections 3, 6, 11-15, 17,
18, 20, 22-24 and 27 of this bill make conforming changes as a result of the
elimination of the permit program for alternative livestock by section 25. Section
26 of this bill declares void the regulations adopted by the State Board of
Agriculture governing the permit program for alternative livestock. Sections 5 and
10 of this bill make conforming changes to refer to provisions that have been
renumbered in section 3. Sections 19 and 21 of this bill make conforming changes
by removing references to sections defining “alternative livestock” that are repealed
in section 27.
