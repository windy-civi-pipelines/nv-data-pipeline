AN ACT relating to governmental administration; revising
provisions governing the prohibition against intentionally
feeding certain animals; prohibiting, with certain
exceptions, a person or any agent or employee of a person

provisions governing certain civil penalties for unlawfully

provisions relating to the importation, possession and
propagation of certain fallow deer or reindeer; providing

thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, the Board of Wildlife Commissioners is required to classify
2 all wildlife by regulation. (NRS 501.110) Existing law also, with certain
3 exceptions, prohibits a person from intentionally feeding a big game mammal
4 without written authorization from the Department. For the purpose of this
5 prohibition, “big game mammal” is defined to include a pronghorn antelope, black
6 bear, mule deer, mountain goat, mountain lion, Rocky Mountain elk and certain
7 subspecies of bighorn sheep. The penalties for violating this prohibition are: (1) a
8 written warning for a first offense; (2) a fine of not more than $250 for a second
9 offense; and (3) a fine of not more than $500 for a third or subsequent offense.
10 (NRS 501.382) Section 7 of this bill expands this prohibition to apply to: (1) the
11 intentional feeding of any wildlife that is classified as a wild mammal by
-
*AB59_R2*

– 2 –
12 regulations adopted by the Board of Wildlife Commissioners; and (2) the taking of
13 any bird that is classified as a game bird by regulations adopted by the Board of
14 Wildlife Commissioners by baiting such a game bird or on or above an area that
15 was baited which the person knows or reasonably should have known was baited.
16 Section 1 of this bill makes a conforming change as a result of the expansion of the
17 prohibition to additional animals.
18 With certain exceptions, existing law prohibits a person or the person’s agent or
19 employee from knowingly bringing into or possessing in this State the carcass or
20 part of the carcass of certain animals. (NRS 501.3845) A person who violates this
21 prohibition is: (1) guilty of a misdemeanor, which is punished by a fine of not less
22 than $50 nor more than $500, or by imprisonment in the county jail for not more
23 than 6 months, or by both fine or imprisonment; and (2) liable for certain civil
24 penalties. (NRS 501.385, 501.3855) Section 8 of this bill also prohibits knowingly
25 bringing into or possessing in this State the excrement or bodily fluid of such
26 animals. Section 8 authorizes the seizure, destruction or removal from this State of
27 such excrement or bodily fluid in the same manner as a carcass or part of a carcass.
28 With certain exceptions and in addition to certain authorized penalties, existing
29 law establishes a civil penalty of not less than $5,000 nor more than $30,000 for
30 unlawfully killing or possessing a trophy big game mammal. For the purpose of this
31 civil penalty, a trophy big game mammal is defined as a mule deer with an outside
32 antler measurement of at least 24 inches, a bighorn sheep of any species with at
33 least one horn exceeding a half curl, a Rocky Mountain elk with at least six antler
34 points on one antler, a pronghorn antelope with at least one horn which is more
35 than 14 inches in length, a mountain goat or a black bear. Also, with certain
36 exceptions and in addition to certain authorized penalties, existing law establishes a
37 civil penalty of not less than $250 and not more than $5,000 for unlawfully killing
38 or possessing certain other animals, including a moose. (NRS 501.3855) Section 9
39 of this bill makes unlawfully killing or possessing a moose subject to the higher
40 civil penalty for trophy big game mammals of not less than $5,000 nor more than
41 $30,000. For the purposes of identifying a trophy big game mammal for imposition
42 of the higher civil penalty, existing law defines the term “antler point” to exclude
43 the first point on the main beam, commonly known as the eye guard, on mule deer.
44 (NRS 501.3855) Existing regulations interpret the exclusion to apply only to mule
45 deer. (NAC 502.1175) Section 9 codifies this interpretation in the Nevada Revised
46 Statutes.
47 Existing law: (1) prohibits any person without a permit from importing,
48 possessing or propagating alternative livestock, which is defined as any species or
49 subspecies of fallow deer or reindeer, if such animals are born and reared in
50 captivity and raised on private property to produce meat or other by-products or for
51 breeding stock; and (2) requires the State Board of Agriculture to adopt regulations
52 governing the permit program for alternative livestock. In adopting such
53 regulations, existing law requires the State Board of Agriculture to consult with the
54 Department of Wildlife and the Board of Wildlife Commissioners concerning the
55 provisions that are necessary to protect wildlife in this State and in certain areas of
56 special concern. (NRS 501.003, 576.129; NAC 576.100-576.260) A person who
57 violates this prohibition: (1) is guilty of a misdemeanor, which is punished by a fine
58 of not more than $1,000 or imprisonment in the county jail for not more than 6
59 months, or by both a fine and imprisonment; and (2) may be liable for a civil
60 penalty of not more than $5,000 for each violation. (NRS 193.150, 576.150)
61 Existing law, with certain exceptions, authorizes a person to bring an animal that is
62 not under special quarantine into this State in compliance with regulations adopted
63 by the State Quarantine Officer. (NRS 571.210) Section 25 of this bill eliminates
64 the permit program for alternative livestock, thereby making it a misdemeanor to
65 import, possess or propagate such fallow deer or reindeer in this State, unless
66 pursuant to the regulations adopted by the State Quarantine Officer that authorize
-
*AB59_R2*

– 3 –
67 certain restricted entry of animals from outside this State. Sections 3, 6, 11-15, 17,
68 18, 20, 22-24 and 27 of this bill make conforming changes as a result of the
69 elimination of the permit program for alternative livestock by section 25. Section
70 26 of this bill declares void the regulations adopted by the State Board of
71 Agriculture governing the permit program for alternative livestock. Sections 5 and
72 10 of this bill make conforming changes to refer to provisions that have been
73 renumbered in section 3. Sections 19 and 21 of this bill make conforming changes
74 by removing references to sections defining “alternative livestock” that are repealed
75 in section 27.
