Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 [Existing law creates the Department of Wildlife and requires the Department to
2 administer the laws governing wildlife and the Nevada Boat Act under the guidance of and
3 regulations adopted by the Board of Wildlife Commissioners. (NRS 488.015, 501.181,
4 501.331) Existing law requires the Director of the Department of Wildlife to designate a
5 number of employees and, if the need exists, other persons outside of the Department as game
6 wardens. (NRS 501.337, 501.339) Existing law provides such game wardens with the powers
7 of a peace officer for the purposes of: (1) the service of such legal process as may be required
8 in the enforcement of the laws governing wildlife and the Nevada Boat Act; and (2) the
9 enforcement of all laws of the State of Nevada while they are performing their duties relating
10 to the enforcement of laws governing wildlife and the Nevada Boat Act. (NRS 289.280)
11 Under existing law, such game wardens have a duty to enforce laws governing wildlife and
12 the Nevada Boat Act. (NRS 501.349) Section 4 of this bill makes enforcement of such laws a
13 power instead of a duty. Sections 4 and 16 of this bill expand the scope of this enforcement
14 authority and the peace officer powers of a game warden to include the enforcement of all
15 laws of the State of Nevada regardless of whether the game wardens are enforcing the laws
16 governing wildlife or the Nevada Boat Act. Section 16 also expands the peace officer powers

Senate Amendment No. 629 to Assembly Bill No. 59 First Reprint Page 4
17 of a game warden to apply to the service of any legal process. Sections 2 and 16 of this bill
18 make conforming changes relating to the authority for designating game wardens.]
19 Under existing law, the Board of Wildlife Commissioners is required to classify all
20 wildlife by regulation. (NRS 501.110) Existing law also, with certain exceptions, prohibits a
21 person from intentionally feeding a big game mammal without written authorization from the
22 Department. For the purpose of this prohibition, “big game mammal” is defined to include a
23 pronghorn antelope, black bear, mule deer, mountain goat, mountain lion, Rocky Mountain
24 elk and certain subspecies of bighorn sheep. The penalties for violating this prohibition are:
25 (1) a written warning for a first offense; (2) a fine of not more than $250 for a second offense;
26 and (3) a fine of not more than $500 for a third or subsequent offense. (NRS 501.382) Section
27 7 of this bill [: (1)] expands this prohibition to apply to : (1) the intentional feeding of any
28 wildlife that is classified as a wild mammal [or game bird] by regulations adopted by the
29 Board of Wildlife Commissioners; and (2) [provides that this prohibition does not apply to the
30 incidental or unintentional feeding of such game birds associated with the use of a bird feeder
31 located not more than 100 feet from a private residence.] the taking of any bird that is
32 classified as a game bird by regulations adopted by the Board of Wildlife Commissioners
33 by baiting such a game bird or on or above an area that was baited which the person
34 knows or reasonably should have known was baited. Section 1 of this bill makes a
35 conforming change as a result of the expansion of the prohibition to additional animals.
36 With certain exceptions, existing law prohibits a person or the person’s agent or
37 employee from knowingly bringing into or possessing in this State the carcass or part of the
38 carcass of certain animals. (NRS 501.3845) A person who violates this prohibition is: (1)
39 guilty of a misdemeanor, which is punished by a fine of not less than $50 nor more than $500,
40 or by imprisonment in the county jail for not more than 6 months, or by both fine or
41 imprisonment; and (2) liable for certain civil penalties. (NRS 501.385, 501.3855) Section 8 of
42 this bill also prohibits knowingly bringing into or possessing in this State the excrement or
43 bodily fluid of such animals. Section 8 authorizes the seizure, destruction or removal from
44 this State of such excrement or bodily fluid in the same manner as a carcass or part of a
45 carcass.
46 With certain exceptions and in addition to certain authorized penalties, existing law
47 establishes a civil penalty of not less than $5,000 nor more than $30,000 for unlawfully killing
48 or possessing a trophy big game mammal. For the purpose of this civil penalty, a trophy big
49 game mammal is defined as a mule deer with an outside antler measurement of at least 24
50 inches, a bighorn sheep of any species with at least one horn exceeding a half curl, a Rocky
51 Mountain elk with at least six antler points on one antler, a pronghorn antelope with at least
52 one horn which is more than 14 inches in length, a mountain goat or a black bear. Also, with
53 certain exceptions and in addition to certain authorized penalties, existing law establishes a
54 civil penalty of not less than $250 and not more than $5,000 for unlawfully killing or
55 possessing certain other animals, including a moose. (NRS 501.3855) Section 9 of this bill
56 makes unlawfully killing or possessing a moose subject to the higher civil penalty for trophy
57 big game mammals of not less than $5,000 nor more than $30,000. For the purposes of
58 identifying a trophy big game mammal for imposition of the higher civil penalty, existing law
59 defines the term “antler point” to exclude the first point on the main beam, commonly known
60 as the eye guard, on mule deer. (NRS 501.3855) Existing regulations interpret the exclusion to
61 apply only to mule deer. (NAC 502.1175) Section 9 codifies this interpretation in the Nevada
62 Revised Statutes.
63 Existing law: (1) prohibits any person without a permit from importing, possessing or
64 propagating alternative livestock, which is defined as any species or subspecies of fallow deer
65 or reindeer, if such animals are born and reared in captivity and raised on private property to
66 produce meat or other by-products or for breeding stock; and (2) requires the State Board of
67 Agriculture to adopt regulations governing the permit program for alternative livestock. In
68 adopting such regulations, existing law requires the State Board of Agriculture to consult with
69 the Department of Wildlife and the Board of Wildlife Commissioners concerning the
70 provisions that are necessary to protect wildlife in this State and in certain areas of special
71 concern. (NRS 501.003, 576.129; NAC 576.100-576.260) A person who violates this
72 prohibition: (1) is guilty of a misdemeanor, which is punished by a fine of not more than
73 $1,000 or imprisonment in the county jail for not more than 6 months, or by both a fine and
74 imprisonment; and (2) may be liable for a civil penalty of not more than $5,000 for each
75 violation. (NRS 193.150, 576.150) Existing law, with certain exceptions, authorizes a person

Senate Amendment No. 629 to Assembly Bill No. 59 First Reprint Page 5
76 to bring an animal that is not under special quarantine into this State in compliance with
77 regulations adopted by the State Quarantine Officer. (NRS 571.210) Section 25 of this bill
78 eliminates the permit program for alternative livestock, thereby making it a misdemeanor to
79 import, possess or propagate such fallow deer or reindeer in this State, unless pursuant to the
80 regulations adopted by the State Quarantine Officer that authorize certain restricted entry of
81 animals from outside this State. Sections 3, 6, 11-15, 17, 18, 20, 22-24 and 27 of this bill
82 make conforming changes as a result of the elimination of the permit program for alternative
83 livestock by section 25. Section 26 of this bill declares void the regulations adopted by the
84 State Board of Agriculture governing the permit program for alternative livestock. Sections 5
85 and 10 of this bill make conforming changes to refer to provisions that have been renumbered
86 in section 3. Sections 19 and 21 of this bill make conforming changes by removing
87 references to sections defining “alternative livestock” that are repealed in section 27.
