Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates the Department of Wildlife and requires the Department to
2 administer the laws governing wildlife and the Nevada Boat Act under the guidance
3 of and regulations adopted by the Board of Wildlife Commissioners. (NRS
4 488.015, 501.181, 501.331) Existing law requires the Director of the Department of
5 Wildlife to designate a number of employees and, if the need exists, other persons
6 outside of the Department as game wardens. (NRS 501.337, 501.339) Existing law
7 provides such game wardens with the powers of a peace officer for the purposes of:
8 (1) the service of such legal process as may be required in the enforcement of the
9 laws governing wildlife and the Nevada Boat Act; and (2) the enforcement of all
10 laws of the State of Nevada while they are performing their duties relating to the
-
*AB59_R1*
– 2 –
11 enforcement of laws governing wildlife and the Nevada Boat Act. (NRS 289.280)
12 Under existing law, such game wardens have a duty to enforce laws governing
13 wildlife and the Nevada Boat Act. (NRS 501.349) Section 4 of this bill makes
14 enforcement of such laws a power instead of a duty. Sections 4 and 16 of this bill
15 expand the scope of this enforcement authority and the peace officer powers of a
16 game warden to include the enforcement of all laws of the State of Nevada
17 regardless of whether the game wardens are enforcing the laws governing wildlife
18 or the Nevada Boat Act. Section 16 also expands the peace officer powers of a
19 game warden to apply to the service of any legal process. Sections 2 and 16 of this
20 bill make conforming changes relating to the authority for designating game
21 wardens.
22 Under existing law, the Board of Wildlife Commissioners is required to classify
23 all wildlife by regulation. (NRS 501.110) Existing law also, with certain
24 exceptions, prohibits a person from intentionally feeding a big game mammal
25 without written authorization from the Department. For the purpose of this
26 prohibition, “big game mammal” is defined to include a pronghorn antelope, black
27 bear, mule deer, mountain goat, mountain lion, Rocky Mountain elk and certain
28 subspecies of bighorn sheep. The penalties for violating this prohibition are: (1) a
29 written warning for a first offense; (2) a fine of not more than $250 for a second
30 offense; and (3) a fine of not more than $500 for a third or subsequent offense.
31 (NRS 501.382) Section 7 of this bill: (1) expands this prohibition to apply to the
32 intentional feeding of any wildlife that is classified as a wild mammal or game bird
33 by regulations adopted by the Board of Wildlife Commissioners; and (2) provides
34 that this prohibition does not apply to the incidental or unintentional feeding of
35 such game birds associated with the use of a bird feeder located not more than 100
36 feet from a private residence. Section 1 of this bill makes a conforming change as a
37 result of the expansion of the prohibition to additional animals.
38 With certain exceptions, existing law prohibits a person or the person’s agent or
39 employee from knowingly bringing into or possessing in this State the carcass or
40 part of the carcass of certain animals. (NRS 501.3845) A person who violates this
41 prohibition is: (1) guilty of a misdemeanor, which is punished by a fine of not less
42 than $50 nor more than $500, or by imprisonment in the county jail for not more
43 than 6 months, or by both fine or imprisonment; and (2) liable for certain civil
44 penalties. (NRS 501.385, 501.3855) Section 8 of this bill also prohibits knowingly
45 bringing into or possessing in this State the excrement or bodily fluid of such
46 animals. Section 8 authorizes the seizure, destruction or removal from this State of
47 such excrement or bodily fluid in the same manner as a carcass or part of a carcass.
48 With certain exceptions and in addition to certain authorized penalties, existing
49 law establishes a civil penalty of not less than $5,000 nor more than $30,000 for
50 unlawfully killing or possessing a trophy big game mammal. For the purpose of this
51 civil penalty, a trophy big game mammal is defined as a mule deer with an outside
52 antler measurement of at least 24 inches, a bighorn sheep of any species with at
53 least one horn exceeding a half curl, a Rocky Mountain elk with at least six antler
54 points on one antler, a pronghorn antelope with at least one horn which is more
55 than 14 inches in length, a mountain goat or a black bear. Also, with certain
56 exceptions and in addition to certain authorized penalties, existing law establishes a
57 civil penalty of not less than $250 and not more than $5,000 for unlawfully killing
58 or possessing certain other animals, including a moose. (NRS 501.3855) Section 9
59 of this bill makes unlawfully killing or possessing a moose subject to the higher
60 civil penalty for trophy big game mammals of not less than $5,000 nor more than
61 $30,000. For the purposes of identifying a trophy big game mammal for imposition
62 of the higher civil penalty, existing law defines the term “antler point” to exclude
63 the first point on the main beam, commonly known as the eye guard, on mule deer.
64 (NRS 501.3855) Existing regulations interpret the exclusion to apply only to mule
-
*AB59_R1*
– 3 –
65 deer. (NAC 502.1175) Section 9 codifies this interpretation in the Nevada Revised
66 Statutes.
67 Existing law: (1) prohibits any person without a permit from importing,
68 possessing or propagating alternative livestock, which is defined as any species or
69 subspecies of fallow deer or reindeer, if such animals are born and reared in
70 captivity and raised on private property to produce meat or other by-products or for
71 breeding stock; and (2) requires the State Board of Agriculture to adopt regulations
72 governing the permit program for alternative livestock. In adopting such
73 regulations, existing law requires the State Board of Agriculture to consult with the
74 Department of Wildlife and the Board of Wildlife Commissioners concerning the
75 provisions that are necessary to protect wildlife in this State and in certain areas of
76 special concern. (NRS 501.003, 576.129; NAC 576.100-576.260) A person who
77 violates this prohibition: (1) is guilty of a misdemeanor, which is punished by a fine
78 of not more than $1,000 or imprisonment in the county jail for not more than 6
79 months, or by both a fine and imprisonment; and (2) may be liable for a civil
80 penalty of not more than $5,000 for each violation. (NRS 193.150, 576.150)
81 Existing law, with certain exceptions, authorizes a person to bring an animal that is
82 not under special quarantine into this State in compliance with regulations adopted
83 by the State Quarantine Officer. (NRS 571.210) Section 25 of this bill eliminates
84 the permit program for alternative livestock, thereby making it a misdemeanor to
85 import, possess or propagate such fallow deer or reindeer in this State, unless
86 pursuant to the regulations adopted by the State Quarantine Officer that authorize
87 certain restricted entry of animals from outside this State. Sections 3, 6, 11-15, 17,
88 18, 20, 22-24 and 27 of this bill make conforming changes as a result of the
89 elimination of the permit program for alternative livestock by section 25. Section
90 26 of this bill declares void the regulations adopted by the State Board of
91 Agriculture governing the permit program for alternative livestock. Sections 5 and
92 10 of this bill make conforming changes to refer to provisions that have been
93 renumbered in section 3. Sections 19 and 21 of this bill make conforming changes
94 by removing references to sections defining “alternative livestock” that are repealed
95 in section 27.

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates the Department of Wildlife and requires the Department to
2 administer the laws governing wildlife and the Nevada Boat Act under the guidance
3 of and regulations adopted by the Board of Wildlife Commissioners. (NRS
4 488.015, 501.181, 501.331) Existing law requires the Director of the Department of
5 Wildlife to designate a number of employees and, if the need exists, other persons
6 outside of the Department as game wardens. (NRS 501.337, 501.339) Existing law
7 provides such game wardens with the powers of a peace officer for the purposes of:
8 (1) the service of such legal process as may be required in the enforcement of the
9 laws governing wildlife and the Nevada Boat Act; and (2) the enforcement of all
10 laws of the State of Nevada while they are performing their duties relating to the
-
*AB59_R1*

– 2 –
11 enforcement of laws governing wildlife and the Nevada Boat Act. (NRS 289.280)
12 Under existing law, such game wardens have a duty to enforce laws governing
13 wildlife and the Nevada Boat Act. (NRS 501.349) Section 4 of this bill makes
14 enforcement of such laws a power instead of a duty. Sections 4 and 16 of this bill
15 expand the scope of this enforcement authority and the peace officer powers of a
16 game warden to include the enforcement of all laws of the State of Nevada
17 regardless of whether the game wardens are enforcing the laws governing wildlife
18 or the Nevada Boat Act. Section 16 also expands the peace officer powers of a
19 game warden to apply to the service of any legal process. Sections 2 and 16 of this
20 bill make conforming changes relating to the authority for designating game
21 wardens.
22 Under existing law, the Board of Wildlife Commissioners is required to classify
23 all wildlife by regulation. (NRS 501.110) Existing law also, with certain
24 exceptions, prohibits a person from intentionally feeding a big game mammal
25 without written authorization from the Department. For the purpose of this
26 prohibition, “big game mammal” is defined to include a pronghorn antelope, black
27 bear, mule deer, mountain goat, mountain lion, Rocky Mountain elk and certain
28 subspecies of bighorn sheep. The penalties for violating this prohibition are: (1) a
29 written warning for a first offense; (2) a fine of not more than $250 for a second
30 offense; and (3) a fine of not more than $500 for a third or subsequent offense.
31 (NRS 501.382) Section 7 of this bill: (1) expands this prohibition to apply to the
32 intentional feeding of any wildlife that is classified as a wild mammal or game bird
33 by regulations adopted by the Board of Wildlife Commissioners; and (2) provides
34 that this prohibition does not apply to the incidental or unintentional feeding of
35 such game birds associated with the use of a bird feeder located not more than 100
36 feet from a private residence. Section 1 of this bill makes a conforming change as a
37 result of the expansion of the prohibition to additional animals.
38 With certain exceptions, existing law prohibits a person or the person’s agent or
39 employee from knowingly bringing into or possessing in this State the carcass or
40 part of the carcass of certain animals. (NRS 501.3845) A person who violates this
41 prohibition is: (1) guilty of a misdemeanor, which is punished by a fine of not less
42 than $50 nor more than $500, or by imprisonment in the county jail for not more
43 than 6 months, or by both fine or imprisonment; and (2) liable for certain civil
44 penalties. (NRS 501.385, 501.3855) Section 8 of this bill also prohibits knowingly
45 bringing into or possessing in this State the excrement or bodily fluid of such
46 animals. Section 8 authorizes the seizure, destruction or removal from this State of
47 such excrement or bodily fluid in the same manner as a carcass or part of a carcass.
48 With certain exceptions and in addition to certain authorized penalties, existing
49 law establishes a civil penalty of not less than $5,000 nor more than $30,000 for
50 unlawfully killing or possessing a trophy big game mammal. For the purpose of this
51 civil penalty, a trophy big game mammal is defined as a mule deer with an outside
52 antler measurement of at least 24 inches, a bighorn sheep of any species with at
53 least one horn exceeding a half curl, a Rocky Mountain elk with at least six antler
54 points on one antler, a pronghorn antelope with at least one horn which is more
55 than 14 inches in length, a mountain goat or a black bear. Also, with certain
56 exceptions and in addition to certain authorized penalties, existing law establishes a
57 civil penalty of not less than $250 and not more than $5,000 for unlawfully killing
58 or possessing certain other animals, including a moose. (NRS 501.3855) Section 9
59 of this bill makes unlawfully killing or possessing a moose subject to the higher
60 civil penalty for trophy big game mammals of not less than $5,000 nor more than
61 $30,000. For the purposes of identifying a trophy big game mammal for imposition
62 of the higher civil penalty, existing law defines the term “antler point” to exclude
63 the first point on the main beam, commonly known as the eye guard, on mule deer.
64 (NRS 501.3855) Existing regulations interpret the exclusion to apply only to mule
-
*AB59_R1*

– 3 –
65 deer. (NAC 502.1175) Section 9 codifies this interpretation in the Nevada Revised
66 Statutes.
67 Existing law: (1) prohibits any person without a permit from importing,
68 possessing or propagating alternative livestock, which is defined as any species or
69 subspecies of fallow deer or reindeer, if such animals are born and reared in
70 captivity and raised on private property to produce meat or other by-products or for
71 breeding stock; and (2) requires the State Board of Agriculture to adopt regulations
72 governing the permit program for alternative livestock. In adopting such
73 regulations, existing law requires the State Board of Agriculture to consult with the
74 Department of Wildlife and the Board of Wildlife Commissioners concerning the
75 provisions that are necessary to protect wildlife in this State and in certain areas of
76 special concern. (NRS 501.003, 576.129; NAC 576.100-576.260) A person who
77 violates this prohibition: (1) is guilty of a misdemeanor, which is punished by a fine
78 of not more than $1,000 or imprisonment in the county jail for not more than 6
79 months, or by both a fine and imprisonment; and (2) may be liable for a civil
80 penalty of not more than $5,000 for each violation. (NRS 193.150, 576.150)
81 Existing law, with certain exceptions, authorizes a person to bring an animal that is
82 not under special quarantine into this State in compliance with regulations adopted
83 by the State Quarantine Officer. (NRS 571.210) Section 25 of this bill eliminates
84 the permit program for alternative livestock, thereby making it a misdemeanor to
85 import, possess or propagate such fallow deer or reindeer in this State, unless
86 pursuant to the regulations adopted by the State Quarantine Officer that authorize
87 certain restricted entry of animals from outside this State. Sections 3, 6, 11-15, 17,
88 18, 20, 22-24 and 27 of this bill make conforming changes as a result of the
89 elimination of the permit program for alternative livestock by section 25. Section
90 26 of this bill declares void the regulations adopted by the State Board of
91 Agriculture governing the permit program for alternative livestock. Sections 5 and
92 10 of this bill make conforming changes to refer to provisions that have been
93 renumbered in section 3. Sections 19 and 21 of this bill make conforming changes
94 by removing references to sections defining “alternative livestock” that are repealed
95 in section 27.
