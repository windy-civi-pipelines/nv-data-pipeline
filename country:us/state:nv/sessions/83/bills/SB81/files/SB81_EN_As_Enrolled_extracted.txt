Section 2:
Section 1 of this bill requires the Department to create and conduct surveys of: (1)
public school employees, assessing school climate and working conditions in

(NRS 387.1213) Section 4 of this bill requires each school district to make this
transfer after the close of the previous fiscal year and before the close of the then
current fiscal year.
Existing law establishes certain requirements governing the use of information
concerning the average daily enrollment of pupils, including, without limitation: (1)
requiring each school district to submit a quarterly report to the Department
containing the average daily enrollment of pupils; and (2) providing the method for
computing the yearly apportionment to the school district from the State Education
Fund. (NRS 387.1223) Section 4.5 of this bill applies these provisions to charter
schools and university schools for profoundly gifted pupils.
Under existing law, certain hospitals and other facilities that provide residential
treatment to children and also operate a licensed private school or an accredited
educational program approved by the Department are authorized to request
reimbursement from the school district or charter school in which a child is enrolled
for the cost of providing educational services to the child who is: (1) verified to be
a patient or resident of the hospital or facility; (2) attends the private school or
educational program for more than 7 school days; and (3) meets certain other

Under the Pupil-Centered Funding Plan, existing law requires a public school
that receives weighted funding for one or more at-risk pupils or pupils who are
English learners to use such funding only to provide services to such pupils, which

Section 3:

“services for at-risk pupils,” and “Zoom services” to “services for pupils who are
English learners.”

published in the most recent annual report regarding the budget of each school
district. (NRS 353.333) Section 32 of this bill requires that this report be compiled

6 to the date by which the compilation of reports regarding the budget of each
school district is required to be submitted to the Office of Finance.

district to publish a quarterly expenditure report for the school district in a

requires the expenditure report to instead be published on the Internet website of
the county school district.
Existing law: (1) provides that the State Board is the sole state agency
responsible for the administration of career and technical education; and (2) sets

than direct, the Superintendent of Public Instruction to make studies and
investigations relating to career and technical education.

such instruction to report to the Superintendent of Public Instruction at such times
and in such manner as the Superintendent of Public Instruction prescribes. (NRS

of such a school district to provide such reports to the Superintendent of Public

the ratio of pupils per licensed teacher for certain grade levels. (NRS 388.725) If
the ratio of pupils per licensed teacher at one or more elementary schools in a
school district exceeds the ratio prescribed by statute during any quarter of a school
year, existing law requires the school district to request a variance from the State
Board for each such school for the subsequent quarter. (NRS 388.700) Section 12
of this bill eliminates the requirement to submit quarterly reports regarding the
average daily enrollment of pupils and the ratio of pupils per licensed teacher for
certain grade levels and requires the board of trustees of each school district to
instead report such information to the Department only on a semiannual basis each
year for: (1) the period beginning on July 1 and ending on September 30; and (2)
the period beginning on January 1 and ending on March 31. Section 9 of this bill
requires a school district to request a variance for an elementary school which
exceeds the maximum ratio of pupils per licensed teacher only if the ratio is
exceeded during a reporting period. Section 9 also: (1) reduces the frequency of the
reports regarding variances requested by school districts which the State Board is
required to submit to the Interim Finance Committee from quarterly to
semiannually; and (2) eliminates the requirement for the State Board to submit a
report to the Legislature regarding variances and the data collected by school
districts on the effectiveness of plans to reduce pupil-teacher ratios.
Existing law requires each school district, in cooperation with the recognized
associations representing licensed educational personnel, to develop a plan to
reduce the pupil-teacher ratio per class in certain grade levels and submit that plan
to the State Board. (NRS 388.720) Section 10 of this bill requires this plan to be

requirements.
Existing law authorizes the board of trustees of a school district or the
governing body of a charter school to offer a work-based learning program upon
the approval of the Superintendent of Public Instruction. (NRS 389.167) Section 17
of this bill eliminates the requirement for a school district or charter school offering
a work-based learning program to submit a biennial report to the State Board and
the Legislature concerning the manner in which the program has been carried out.
Existing law requires the Commission on Professional Standards in Education
to prescribe by regulation the qualifications for licensing teachers and other
educational personnel. (NRS 391.019) Section 18 of this bill: (1) eliminates the
requirement for the Commission to prescribe qualifications for licensing
administrators through an alternative route to licensure; and (2) requires the
Commission to prescribe qualifications and procedures for licensed teachers and
other licensed educational personnel to become licensed as an administrator
without restricting the ability of such a person to obtain employment as an
administrator.
Existing law requires each school district that employs a consultant to submit a
report to the Interim Finance Committee at least once every 6 months. (NRS

AN ACT relating to education; requiring the Department of
Education to create and conduct certain surveys of public
school employees; revising provisions governing the
reimbursement of certain hospitals or other facilities that
provide educational services; revising terminology related to
services provided to certain students; revising various
reporting requirements relating to education; revising
provisions governing the authority of the State Board
of Education; revising provisions governing the ratios of
pupils to licensed teachers; eliminating certain audits of
empowerment schools; revising provisions governing the
licensure of administrators; repealing provisions governing
the Nevada Teacher Advancement Scholarship Program and
the Incentivizing Pathways to Teaching Grant Program;

study; requiring the Department to create a program of block
grants for such scholarship and grant programs; eliminating
provisions requiring the Department to recommend that a
minimum amount be spent by public schools on textbooks
and other instructional supplies; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law creates the Department of Education, which consists of the State
Board of Education and the Superintendent of Public Instruction. (NRS 385.010)
Section 1 of this bill requires the Department to create and conduct surveys of: (1)
public school employees, assessing school climate and working conditions in
schools; and (2) public school employees who are leaving employment at a public
school. Section 1 additionally: (1) sets forth when such surveys must be
administered; (2) sets forth how a school district must use the results of such
surveys; (3) prohibits data collected from such surveys from being used in certain
evaluations; (4) requires the Department to recognize schools which achieve a
certain response rate on such surveys in the statewide system of accountability; and
(5) requires the Department to submit annually to the Commission on School
Funding and the State Board a report containing data from the surveys.
Existing law requires the principal of each school, in consultation with the
employees of the school, to prepare a plan to improve the achievement of the pupils
enrolled in the school. (NRS 385A.650) Section 2 of this bill requires the plan to be
informed by the results of surveys conducted pursuant to section 1.
Existing law creates the Education Stabilization Account in the State Education
Fund and requires each school district, each year after the close of the previous
fiscal year and before the issuance of the State Controller’s annual report, to
transfer from the county school district fund to the Education Stabilization Account
any amount by which the actual ending fund balance of the county school district
fund exceeds 16.6 percent of the total actual expenditures for the fund.
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 2 –
(NRS 387.1213) Section 4 of this bill requires each school district to make this
transfer after the close of the previous fiscal year and before the close of the then
current fiscal year.
Existing law establishes certain requirements governing the use of information
concerning the average daily enrollment of pupils, including, without limitation: (1)
requiring each school district to submit a quarterly report to the Department
containing the average daily enrollment of pupils; and (2) providing the method for
computing the yearly apportionment to the school district from the State Education
Fund. (NRS 387.1223) Section 4.5 of this bill applies these provisions to charter
schools and university schools for profoundly gifted pupils.
Under existing law, certain hospitals and other facilities that provide residential
treatment to children and also operate a licensed private school or an accredited
educational program approved by the Department are authorized to request
reimbursement from the school district or charter school in which a child is enrolled
for the cost of providing educational services to the child who is: (1) verified to be
a patient or resident of the hospital or facility; (2) attends the private school or
educational program for more than 7 school days; and (3) meets certain other
requirements. (NRS 387.1225) Section 4.7 of this bill: (1) changes the entity from
which reimbursement is authorized to be requested to the Department; and (2)
makes conforming changes to reflect this change.
Under the Pupil-Centered Funding Plan, existing law requires a public school
that receives weighted funding for one or more at-risk pupils or pupils who are
English learners to use such funding only to provide services to such pupils, which
are referred to as “Victory services” and “Zoom services,” respectively. (NRS
387.121, 387.12445) Section 5 of this bill changes the term “Victory services” to
“services for at-risk pupils,” and “Zoom services” to “services for pupils who are
English learners.”
Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district and the
governing body of each charter school to submit to the Superintendent of Public
Instruction and certain other recipients, on or before November 1 of each year, a
report regarding the budget of the school district or charter school. (NRS 387.303,
388A.345) Existing law requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction, on or
before November 25 of each year, to submit a compilation of the reports made by
each school district and charter school to the Office of Finance in the Office of the
Governor and the Fiscal Analysis Division of the Legislative Counsel Bureau.
(NRS 387.303, 388A.345) Existing law requires the governing body of a university
school for profoundly gifted pupils to submit a similar report to the Department of
Education on or before November 15 of each year. (NRS 388C.250) Sections 6, 13
and 15 of this bill require these reports to be submitted annually, on or before the
Friday of the first week in January that contains 5 business days. Sections 6 and 13
require the compilation of reports to be submitted on or before the last Friday in
January.
Existing law requires the Governor, on or before January 1 of each year, to
compile a report on the status of the finances of the State, including the information
published in the most recent annual report regarding the budget of each school
district. (NRS 353.333) Section 32 of this bill requires that this report be compiled
on or before February 15 of each year, to conform with the change made by section
6 to the date by which the compilation of reports regarding the budget of each
school district is required to be submitted to the Office of Finance.
Existing law requires the clerk of the board of trustees of a county school
district to publish a quarterly expenditure report for the school district in a
newspaper that meets certain qualifications. (NRS 387.320) Section 7 of this bill
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 3 –
requires the expenditure report to instead be published on the Internet website of
the county school district.
Existing law: (1) provides that the State Board is the sole state agency
responsible for the administration of career and technical education; and (2) sets
forth actions the State Board is authorized to take in relation to such authority.
(NRS 388.360) Section 7.3 of this bill authorizes the State Board to request, rather
than direct, the Superintendent of Public Instruction to make studies and
investigations relating to career and technical education.
Existing law requires the Executive Officer of the State Board to designate a
program professional to perform certain duties relating to programs of career and
technical education that have received grants of money. (NRS 388.396) Section 7.7
of this bill instead requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction to designate a
program professional to perform such duties.
Existing law authorizes the board of trustees of a school district, with the
approval of the juvenile court and the board of county commissioners, to employ
qualified teachers for the instruction of children detained in facilities for the
detention of children, alternative programs and juvenile forestry camps. (NRS
388.550) Existing law requires the board of trustees of a school district providing
such instruction to report to the Superintendent of Public Instruction at such times
and in such manner as the Superintendent of Public Instruction prescribes. (NRS
388.570) Section 8 of this bill eliminates the requirement for the board of trustees
of such a school district to provide such reports to the Superintendent of Public
Instruction.
Existing law prohibits the ratio of pupils per licensed teacher in certain classes
from exceeding certain ratios during each school quarter of a school year. (NRS
388.700) Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district to report
to the Department, on a quarterly basis, the average daily enrollment of pupils and
the ratio of pupils per licensed teacher for certain grade levels. (NRS 388.725) If
the ratio of pupils per licensed teacher at one or more elementary schools in a
school district exceeds the ratio prescribed by statute during any quarter of a school
year, existing law requires the school district to request a variance from the State
Board for each such school for the subsequent quarter. (NRS 388.700) Section 12
of this bill eliminates the requirement to submit quarterly reports regarding the
average daily enrollment of pupils and the ratio of pupils per licensed teacher for
certain grade levels and requires the board of trustees of each school district to
instead report such information to the Department only on a semiannual basis each
year for: (1) the period beginning on July 1 and ending on September 30; and (2)
the period beginning on January 1 and ending on March 31. Section 9 of this bill
requires a school district to request a variance for an elementary school which
exceeds the maximum ratio of pupils per licensed teacher only if the ratio is
exceeded during a reporting period. Section 9 also: (1) reduces the frequency of the
reports regarding variances requested by school districts which the State Board is
required to submit to the Interim Finance Committee from quarterly to
semiannually; and (2) eliminates the requirement for the State Board to submit a
report to the Legislature regarding variances and the data collected by school
districts on the effectiveness of plans to reduce pupil-teacher ratios.
Existing law requires each school district, in cooperation with the recognized
associations representing licensed educational personnel, to develop a plan to
reduce the pupil-teacher ratio per class in certain grade levels and submit that plan
to the State Board. (NRS 388.720) Section 10 of this bill requires this plan to be
submitted to the State Board on or before October 1 of each year.
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 4 –
Section 11 of this bill eliminates the requirement for the Department to develop
policies and procedures for the distribution of money to each school district for the
reduction of pupil-teacher ratios.
Existing law requires the sponsor of a charter school that has received, within
each of the immediately preceding 3 consecutive school years, one of the two
lowest ratings of performance pursuant to the statewide system of accountability for
public schools to submit a report to the Joint Interim Standing Committee on
Education on or before December 15 of each odd-numbered year describing certain
actions taken by the sponsor of the charter school. (NRS 388A.355) Section 14 of
this bill requires this report to be submitted annually, on or before February 15.
Existing law requires: (1) certain charter schools that are approved to operate as
empowerment schools to submit a quarterly report to the Department containing
certain financial information and information concerning the school’s compliance
with its empowerment plan; (2) the board of trustees of a school district and the
Department to conduct financial audits of empowerment schools; and (3) such
reports and audits concerning empowerment schools to be compiled and forwarded
to certain entities. (NRS 388G.200) Section 16 of this bill eliminates these
requirements.
Existing law authorizes the board of trustees of a school district or the
governing body of a charter school to offer a work-based learning program upon
the approval of the Superintendent of Public Instruction. (NRS 389.167) Section 17
of this bill eliminates the requirement for a school district or charter school offering
a work-based learning program to submit a biennial report to the State Board and
the Legislature concerning the manner in which the program has been carried out.
Existing law requires the Commission on Professional Standards in Education
to prescribe by regulation the qualifications for licensing teachers and other
educational personnel. (NRS 391.019) Section 18 of this bill: (1) eliminates the
requirement for the Commission to prescribe qualifications for licensing
administrators through an alternative route to licensure; and (2) requires the
Commission to prescribe qualifications and procedures for licensed teachers and
other licensed educational personnel to become licensed as an administrator
without restricting the ability of such a person to obtain employment as an
administrator.
Existing law requires each school district that employs a consultant to submit a
report to the Interim Finance Committee at least once every 6 months. (NRS
391.155) Section 19 of this bill reduces the frequency of this report to at least once
annually.
Existing law: (1) establishes the Teach Nevada Scholarship Program, the
Nevada Teacher Advancement Scholarship Program and the Incentivizing
Pathways to Teaching Grant Program; and (2) sets forth requirements for the
administration of these programs. (NRS 391A.550-391A.595, 391A.650-391A.695,
391A.700, 391A.705, 391A.710) Sections 20-31 of this bill transfer the
administration of these programs from the State Board to the Department. Section
19.5 of this bill requires the Department to create a program of block grants to
provide one lump-sum grant to an institution that receives a grant from each of
these programs. Section 21 expands the eligibility for Teach Nevada Scholarships
to include Nevada residents who graduated from high school in another state or
who, before the age of 20, successfully completed the high school equivalency
assessment selected by the State Board in another state. Section 26 additionally
expands the programs for which a student is eligible to receive a Nevada Teacher
Advancement Scholarship to include programs which: (1) result in a certificate of
advanced study or other degree which is more advanced than a bachelor’s degree,
in education or a related field of study; or (2) upon completion, make a student
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 5 –
eligible to obtain a license and endorsement to teach in a subject area for which
there is a shortage of teachers. Section 27 also makes a conforming change relating
to the amount which may be awarded under the Nevada Teacher Advancement
Scholarship Program to reflect the additional programs for which a Nevada Teacher
Advancement Scholarship may be awarded as provided in section 26.
Sections 20.5, 21.5, 22 and 24.5 of this bill become effective on July 1, 2027.
Section 20.5: (1) changes the name of the Teach Nevada Scholarship Program
Account to the Teach Nevada Recruitment, Preparation and Retention Program
Account; and (2) eliminates the requirement that money in the Account may only
be used to award grants to entities to award scholarships pursuant to section 22.
Section 21.5 expands the programs whose students are eligible to receive a
scholarship from an institution that receives a grant from the Account. Section 22
eliminates the requirement that the recipient of a scholarship provided by an
institution which receives a grant from the Account meet certain requirements to
receive the remaining 25 percent of the scholarship that has not been disbursed.
Section 22 additionally: (1) expands the group of students who may receive such a
scholarship; (2) changes the method for determining the maximum amount of a
scholarship a student may receive; and (3) requires institutions that receive grants
to provide such scholarships to enter an agreement to share data with the
Department. Sections 21.5, 22 and 24.5 make conforming changes to reflect the
change in the name of the Account.
Section 35 of this bill repeals provisions requiring the Department to: (1)
recommend that a minimum amount of money be spent during each fiscal year of
the biennium on textbooks, instructional supplies, instructional software and
instructional hardware by all school districts, charter schools and university schools
for profoundly gifted pupils; and (2) publish a report on school districts, charter
schools and university schools for profoundly gifted pupils which did not spend the
recommended minimum amount. Section 35 also repeals provisions requiring the
board of trustees of each school district to submit an annual report concerning
professional development training offered by the school district.
Section 35.5 of this bill repeals provisions governing the Nevada Teacher
Advancement Scholarship Program and the Incentivizing Pathways to Teaching
Grant Program, including, without limitation, sections 25-31, on July 1, 2027.
Section 35.7 of this bill requires any money that is in the budget account for the
Incentivizing Pathways to Teaching Grant Program Account and the Nevada
Teacher Advancement Scholarship Program Account on June 30, 2027, to be
transferred to the Teach Nevada Scholarship Program Account.

shall transfer from the county school district fund to the Education
Stabilization Account any amount by which the actual ending fund
balance of the county school district fund exceeds 16.6 percent of
the total actual expenditures for the fund. The interest and income
earned on the money in the Account, after deducting any applicable

-
83rd Session (2025)

– 8 –
2. Money transferred pursuant to subsection 1 to the Education
Stabilization Account is a continuing appropriation solely for the
purpose of authorizing the expenditure of the transferred money for
the purposes set forth in this section.
3. The balance in the Education Stabilization Account must not
exceed 20 percent of the total of all appropriations and
authorizations from the State Education Fund, excluding the
Education Stabilization Account, for the immediately preceding
fiscal year. Any money transferred to the Education Stabilization
Account which exceeds this amount must instead be transferred to
the State Education Fund.
4. If the Interim Finance Committee finds that:
(a) Upon submission of a request from the Department, the
actual enrollment growth for a fiscal year exceeds the projected
enrollment growth by an amount that the Interim Finance
Committee determines would make a transfer of money to the State
Education Fund necessary to fund the excess enrollment;
(b) The collection of revenue in any fiscal year will result in the
State Education Fund receiving less money than authorized for
expenditure from the State Education Fund;
(c) Upon submission of a request from the Department, any
amount of money which was deposited in the State Education Fund
is found by an audit to have been deposited in error; or
(d) Upon submission of a request from the Department, any
error in the application of the Pupil-Centered Funding Plan by the
Department has created a shortfall in the State Education Fund,
 the Committee shall by resolution establish an amount of money
to transfer from the Education Stabilization Account to the State
Education Fund and direct the State Controller to transfer that
amount to the State Education Fund. The State Controller shall
thereupon make the transfer.
5. When determining the actual ending fund balance for the
purposes of subsection 1, each county school district shall exclude:
(a) Any money deposited in the county school district fund on or
before June 30, 2020;
(b) Any money apportioned to the county school district for
