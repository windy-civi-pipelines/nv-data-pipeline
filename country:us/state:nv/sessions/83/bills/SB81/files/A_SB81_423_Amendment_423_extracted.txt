Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates the Department of Education, which consists of the State Board of
2 Education and the Superintendent of Public Instruction. (NRS 385.010) Section 1 of this bill
3 requires the Department to create and conduct surveys of: (1) public school employees,
4 assessing school climate and working conditions in schools; and (2) public school employees
5 who are leaving employment at a public school. Section 1 additionally: (1) sets forth when
6 such surveys must be administered; (2) sets forth how a school district must use the results of
7 such surveys; (3) prohibits data collected from such surveys from being used in certain
8 evaluations; (4) requires the Department to recognize schools which achieve a certain
9 response rate on such surveys in the statewide system of accountability; and (5) requires the
10 Department to submit annually to the Commission on School Funding and the State Board a
11 report containing data from the surveys.
Senate Amendment No. 423 to Senate Bill No. 81 Page 4
12 Existing law requires the principal of each school, in consultation with the employees of
13 the school, to prepare a plan to improve the achievement of the pupils enrolled in the school.
14 (NRS 385A.650) Section 2 of this bill requires the plan to be informed by the results of
15 surveys conducted pursuant to section 1.
16 [Existing law creates the State Education Fund as a special revenue fund for the purpose
17 of supporting the operation of the public schools in this State and identifies sources of revenue
18 for the Fund, including: (1) all money derived from interest on the State Permanent School
19 Fund, together with all money derived from other sources provided by law; and (2) certain
20 revenues from excise taxes on cannabis or cannabis products or generated from fees imposed
21 on cannabis establishments. (NRS 387.1212, 372A.290, 387.030, 678B.390) Section 3 of this
22 bill requires all money derived from interest on the State Permanent School Fund, together
23 with all money derived from other sources provided by law, to be transferred to the State
24 Education Fund on a quarterly basis. Sections 33 and 34 of this bill likewise require the
25 Department of Taxation and the Cannabis Compliance Board, respectively, to distribute
26 certain revenues from excise taxes on cannabis and cannabis products and fees imposed on
27 cannabis establishments to the State Treasurer on a quarterly basis for deposit in the State
28 Education Fund.]
29 Existing law creates the Education Stabilization Account in the State Education Fund and
30 requires each school district, each year after the close of the previous fiscal year and before
31 the issuance of the State Controller’s annual report, to transfer from the county school district
32 fund to the Education Stabilization Account any amount by which the actual ending fund
33 balance of the county school district fund exceeds 16.6 percent of the total actual expenditures
34 for the fund. (NRS 387.1213) Section 4 of this bill requires each school district to make this
35 transfer after the close of the previous fiscal year and before the close of the then current fiscal
36 year.
37 Existing law establishes certain requirements governing the use of information
38 concerning the average daily enrollment of pupils, including, without limitation: (1)
39 requiring each school district to submit a quarterly report to the Department containing
40 the average daily enrollment of pupils; and (2) providing the method for computing the
41 yearly apportionment to the school district from the State Education Fund. (NRS
42 387.1223) Section 4.5 of this bill applies these provisions to charter schools and
43 university schools for profoundly gifted pupils.
44 Under the Pupil-Centered Funding Plan, existing law requires a public school that
45 receives weighted funding for one or more at-risk pupils or pupils who are English learners to
46 use such funding only to provide services to such pupils, which are referred to as “Victory
47 services” and “Zoom services,” respectively. (NRS 387.121, 387.12445) Section 5 of this bill
48 changes the term “Victory services” to “services for at-risk pupils,” and “Zoom services” to
49 “services for pupils who are English learners.”
50 Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district and the governing body
51 of each charter school to submit to the Superintendent of Public Instruction and certain other
52 recipients, on or before November 1 of each year, a report regarding the budget of the school
53 district or charter school. (NRS 387.303, 388A.345) Existing law requires the Superintendent
54 of Public Instruction, on or before November 25 of each year, to submit a compilation of the
55 reports made by each school district and charter school to the Office of Finance in the Office
56 of the Governor and the Fiscal Analysis Division of the Legislative Counsel Bureau. (NRS
57 387.303, 388A.345) Existing law requires the governing body of a university school for
58 profoundly gifted pupils to submit a similar report to the Department of Education on or
59 before November 15 of each year. (NRS 388C.250) Sections 6, 13 and 15 of this bill require
60 these reports to be submitted annually, on or before the Friday of the first week in January that
61 contains 5 business days. Sections 6 and 13 require the compilation of reports to be submitted
62 on or before the last Friday in January.
63 Existing law requires the Governor, on or before January 1 of each year, to compile a
64 report on the status of the finances of the State, including the information published in the
65 most recent annual report regarding the budget of each school district. (NRS 353.333) Section
66 32 of this bill requires that this report be compiled on or before February 15 of each year, to
67 conform with the change made by section 6 to the date by which the compilation of reports
68 regarding the budget of each school district is required to be submitted to the Office of
69 Finance.
Senate Amendment No. 423 to Senate Bill No. 81 Page 5
70 Existing law requires the clerk of the board of trustees of a county school district to
71 publish a quarterly expenditure report for the school district in a newspaper that meets certain
72 qualifications. (NRS 387.320) Section 7 of this bill requires the expenditure report to instead
73 be published on the Internet website of the county school district.
74 Existing law: (1) provides that the State Board is the sole state agency responsible
75 for the administration of career and technical education; and (2) sets forth actions the
76 State Board is authorized to take in relation to such authority. (NRS 388.360) Section 7.3
77 of this bill authorizes the State Board to request, rather than direct, the Superintendent
78 of Public Instruction to make studies and investigations relating to career and technical
79 education.
80 Existing law requires the Executive Officer of the State Board to designate a
81 program professional to perform certain duties relating to programs of career and
82 technical education that have received grants of money. (NRS 388.396) Section 7.7 of this
83 bill instead requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction to designate a program
84 professional to perform such duties.
85 Existing law authorizes the board of trustees of a school district, with the approval of the
86 juvenile court and the board of county commissioners, to employ qualified teachers for the
87 instruction of children detained in facilities for the detention of children, alternative programs
88 and juvenile forestry camps. (NRS 388.550) Existing law requires the board of trustees of a
89 school district providing such instruction to report to the Superintendent of Public Instruction
90 at such times and in such manner as the Superintendent of Public Instruction prescribes. (NRS
91 388.570) Section 8 of this bill eliminates the requirement for the board of trustees of such a
92 school district to provide such reports to the Superintendent of Public Instruction.
93 Existing law prohibits the ratio of pupils per licensed teacher in certain classes from
94 exceeding certain ratios during each school quarter of a school year. (NRS 388.700) Existing
95 law requires the board of trustees of each school district to report to the Department, on a
96 quarterly basis, the average daily enrollment of pupils and the ratio of pupils per licensed
97 teacher for certain grade levels. (NRS 388.725) If the ratio of pupils per licensed teacher at
98 one or more elementary schools in a school district exceeds the ratio prescribed by statute
99 during any quarter of a school year, existing law requires the school district to request a
100 variance from the State Board for each such school for the subsequent quarter. (NRS 388.700)
101 Section 12 of this bill eliminates the requirement to submit quarterly reports regarding the
102 average daily enrollment of pupils and the ratio of pupils per licensed teacher for certain grade
103 levels and requires the board of trustees of each school district to instead report such
104 information to the Department only on a semiannual basis each year for: (1) the period
105 beginning on July 1 and ending on September 30; and (2) the period beginning on January 1
106 and ending on March 31. Section 9 of this bill requires a school district to request a variance
107 for an elementary school which exceeds the maximum ratio of pupils per licensed teacher only
108 if the ratio is exceeded during a reporting period. Section 9 also: (1) reduces the frequency of
109 the reports regarding variances requested by school districts which the State Board is required
110 to submit to the Interim Finance Committee from quarterly to semiannually; and (2)
111 eliminates the requirement for the State Board to submit a report to the Legislature regarding
112 variances and the data collected by school districts on the effectiveness of plans to reduce
113 pupil-teacher ratios.
114 Existing law requires each school district, in cooperation with the recognized associations
115 representing licensed educational personnel, to develop a plan to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio
116 per class in certain grade levels and submit that plan to the State Board. (NRS 388.720)
117 Section 10 of this bill requires this plan to be submitted to the State Board on or before
118 October 1 of each year.
119 Section 11 of this bill eliminates the requirement for the Department to develop policies
120 and procedures for the distribution of money to each school district for the reduction of pupil-
121 teacher ratios.
122 Existing law requires the sponsor of a charter school that has received, within each of the
123 immediately preceding 3 consecutive school years, one of the two lowest ratings of
124 performance pursuant to the statewide system of accountability for public schools to submit a
125 report to the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Education on or before December 15 of
126 each odd-numbered year describing certain actions taken by the sponsor of the charter school.
127 (NRS 388A.355) Section 14 of this bill requires this report to be submitted annually, on or
128 before February 15.
Senate Amendment No. 423 to Senate Bill No. 81 Page 6
129 Existing law requires: (1) certain charter schools that are approved to operate as
130 empowerment schools to submit a quarterly report to the Department containing certain
131 financial information and information concerning the school’s compliance with its
132 empowerment plan; (2) the board of trustees of a school district and the Department to
133 conduct financial audits of empowerment schools; and (3) such reports and audits concerning
134 empowerment schools to be compiled and forwarded to certain entities. (NRS 388G.200)
135 Section 16 of this bill eliminates these requirements.
136 Existing law authorizes the board of trustees of a school district or the governing body of
137 a charter school to offer a work-based learning program upon the approval of the
138 Superintendent of Public Instruction. (NRS 389.167) Section 17 of this bill eliminates the
139 requirement for a school district or charter school offering a work-based learning program to
140 submit a biennial report to the State Board and the Legislature concerning the manner in
141 which the program has been carried out.
142 Existing law requires the Commission on Professional Standards in Education to
143 prescribe by regulation the qualifications for licensing teachers and other educational
144 personnel. (NRS 391.019) Section 18 of this bill: (1) eliminates the requirement for the
145 Commission to prescribe qualifications for licensing administrators through an alternative
146 route to licensure; and (2) requires the Commission to prescribe qualifications and procedures
147 for licensed teachers and other licensed educational personnel to become licensed as an
148 administrator [.] without restricting the ability of such a person to obtain employment as
149 an administrator.
150 Existing law requires each school district that employs a consultant to submit a report to
151 the Interim Finance Committee at least once every 6 months. (NRS 391.155) Section 19 of
152 this bill reduces the frequency of this report to at least once annually.
153 Existing law: (1) establishes the Teach Nevada Scholarship Program, the Nevada Teacher
154 Advancement Scholarship Program and the Incentivizing Pathways to Teaching Grant
155 Program; and (2) sets forth requirements for the administration of these programs. (NRS
156 391A.550-391A.595, 391A.650-391A.695, 391A.700, 391A.705, 391A.710) Sections 20-31
157 of this bill transfer the administration of these programs from the State Board to the
158 Department. Section 19.3 of this bill requires the Department to create a program of
159 block grants to provide one lump-sum grant to an institution that receives a grant from
160 each of these programs. Section 21 expands the eligibility for Teach Nevada Scholarships to
161 include Nevada residents who graduated from high school in another state or who, before the
162 age of 20, successfully completed the high school equivalency assessment selected by the
163 State Board in another state. Section 26 additionally expands the programs for which a
164 student is eligible to receive a Nevada Teacher Advancement Scholarship to include programs
165 which: (1) result in a certificate of advanced study or other degree which is more advanced
166 than a bachelor’s degree, in education or a related field of study; or (2) upon completion,
167 make a student eligible to obtain a license and endorsement to teach in a subject area for
168 which there is a shortage of teachers. Sections 22 and 27 eliminate the requirement that the
169 recipient of a Teach Nevada Scholarship or Nevada Teacher Advancement Scholarship
170 meet certain requirements to receive the remaining 25 percent of the scholarship that
171 has not been disbursed. Section 27 also makes a conforming change relating to the amount
172 which may be awarded under the Nevada Teacher Advancement Scholarship Program to
173 reflect the additional programs for which a Nevada Teacher Advancement Scholarship may be
174 awarded as provided in section 26. Section 19.7 of this bill creates the Incentivizing
175 Pathways to Teaching Grant Program Account.
176 Section 35 of this bill repeals provisions requiring the Department to: (1) recommend that
177 a minimum amount of money be spent during each fiscal year of the biennium on textbooks,
178 instructional supplies, instructional software and instructional hardware by all school districts,
179 charter schools and university schools for profoundly gifted pupils; and (2) publish a report on
180 school districts, charter schools and university schools for profoundly gifted pupils which did
181 not spend the recommended minimum amount. Section 35 also repeals provisions requiring
182 the board of trustees of each school district to submit an annual report concerning professional
183 development training offered by the school district.

35 school district shall transfer from the county school district fund to the Education
36 Stabilization Account any amount by which the actual ending fund balance of the
37 county school district fund exceeds 16.6 percent of the total actual expenditures for
38 the fund. The interest and income earned on the money in the Account, after
39 deducting any applicable charges, must be credited to the Account.
40 2. Money transferred pursuant to subsection 1 to the Education Stabilization

49 4. If the Interim Finance Committee finds that:
50 (a) Upon submission of a request from the Department, the actual enrollment

Senate Amendment No. 423 to Senate Bill No. 81 Page 9
1 (b) The collection of revenue in any fiscal year will result in the State
2 Education Fund receiving less money than authorized for expenditure from the

27 amount of money available in the State Education Fund because of a delay in
28 expected receipts, he or she may request from the Director of the Office of Finance
29 a temporary advance from the Education Stabilization Account for the payment of
30 such money due. Upon receipt of such a request, the Director of the Office of
31 Finance shall make a recommendation to the Interim Finance Committee to
32 approve the temporary advance in whole or in part or to deny the request. If the
33 Interim Finance Committee approves the request in whole or in part, the Director of
34 the Office of Finance shall notify the State Controller and the Fiscal Analysis
35 Division of the Legislative Counsel Bureau of the amount approved by the Interim
36 Finance Committee, and the State Controller shall draw his or her warrant upon
37 receipt of such a notice of approval. Any money which is temporarily advanced

39 repaid by August 31 following the end of the fiscal year in which the temporary
40 advance is made.
41 7. The balance remaining in the State Education Fund, excluding the balance
42 remaining in the Education Stabilization Account, that has not been committed for
43 expenditure on or before June 30 of an odd-numbered fiscal year must be
44 transferred to the Education Stabilization Account to the extent that such a transfer
45 would not cause the balance in the Education Stabilization Account to exceed the
46 limit established in subsection 3.
47 Sec. 4.5. NRS 387.1223 is hereby amended to read as follows:
48 387.1223 1. On or before October 1, January 1, April 1 and July 1, each

Section 2:
387.206 Recommended minimum expenditure by school districts, charter

Section 3:
1. On or before August 1 of each odd-numbered year, the Department, in

Analysis Division of the Legislative Counsel Bureau, shall determine a
recommended minimum amount of money to be expended during each fiscal year
of a biennium for textbooks, instructional supplies, instructional software and
instructional hardware by all school districts, charter schools and university schools
for profoundly gifted pupils. The amount must be determined by increasing the
amount that was established for the Fiscal Year 2004-2005 by the percentage of the
change in enrollment between Fiscal Year 2004-2005 and the fiscal year for which
the amount is being established, plus any inflationary adjustment approved by the
Legislature after Fiscal Year 2004-2005.

Section 4:
2. The Department, in consultation with the Budget Division of the Office of
Finance and the Fiscal Analysis Division of the Legislative Counsel Bureau, shall
develop or revise, as applicable, a formula for determining the minimum amount of
money that each school district, charter school and university school for profoundly
gifted pupils is recommended to expend each fiscal year for textbooks, instructional
supplies, instructional software and instructional hardware. The sum of all of the
minimum amounts determined pursuant to this subsection must be equal to the
combined minimum amount determined pursuant to subsection 1. The formula
must be used only to develop expenditure recommendations and must not be used
to alter the yearly apportionment from the State Education Fund to school districts,
charter schools or university schools for profoundly gifted pupils.

Section 5:
3. Upon approval of the formula pursuant to subsection 2, the Department
shall provide written notice to each school district, charter school and university
school for profoundly gifted pupils on or before August 15 of each odd-numbered
year that sets forth the recommended minimum combined amount of money that the
school district, charter school and university school for profoundly gifted pupils
may expend for textbooks, instructional supplies, instructional software and
instructional hardware for each fiscal year of a biennium.

minimum expenditure.
Senate Amendment No. 423 to Senate Bill No. 81 Page 40

Section 7:
1. On or before January 1 of each year, the Department shall determine
whether each school district, charter school and university school for profoundly
gifted pupils has expended, during the immediately preceding fiscal year, the
recommended minimum amount of money set forth in the notice provided pursuant
to subsection 3 of NRS 387.206. In making this determination, the Department

(b) The charter school pursuant to NRS 388A.345.
(c) The university school for profoundly gifted pupils pursuant to NRS
388C.250.

Section 8:
2. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3, if the Department determines
that a school district, charter school or university school for profoundly gifted
pupils, as applicable, has not expended the recommended minimum amount of
money set forth in the notice or the revised notice, as applicable, provided pursuant
to subsection 3 of NRS 387.206, the Department shall publish a report on an
Internet website maintained by the Department which identifies the difference
between the actual combined expenditure for textbooks, instructional supplies,
instructional software and instructional hardware and the minimum recommended
combined expenditure set forth in the notice provided pursuant to subsection 3 of
NRS 387.206.

Section 9:
3. If the actual enrollment of pupils in a school district, charter school or
university school for profoundly gifted pupils is less than the enrollment included in
the projections used in the biennial budget of the school district submitted pursuant
to NRS 387.303, the budget of the charter school submitted pursuant to NRS
388A.345 or the report of the university school for profoundly gifted pupils
submitted pursuant to NRS 388C.250, as applicable, the recommended expenditure
for textbooks, instructional supplies, instructional software and instructional
hardware pursuant to NRS 387.206 must be reduced proportionately.

providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates the Department of Education, which consists of the State Board of
2 Education and the Superintendent of Public Instruction. (NRS 385.010) Section 1 of this bill
3 requires the Department to create and conduct surveys of: (1) public school employees,
4 assessing school climate and working conditions in schools; and (2) public school employees
5 who are leaving employment at a public school. Section 1 additionally: (1) sets forth when
6 such surveys must be administered; (2) sets forth how a school district must use the results of
7 such surveys; (3) prohibits data collected from such surveys from being used in certain
8 evaluations; (4) requires the Department to recognize schools which achieve a certain
9 response rate on such surveys in the statewide system of accountability; and (5) requires the
10 Department to submit annually to the Commission on School Funding and the State Board a
11 report containing data from the surveys.

Senate Amendment No. 423 to Senate Bill No. 81 Page 4
12 Existing law requires the principal of each school, in consultation with the employees of
13 the school, to prepare a plan to improve the achievement of the pupils enrolled in the school.
14 (NRS 385A.650) Section 2 of this bill requires the plan to be informed by the results of
15 surveys conducted pursuant to section 1.
16 [Existing law creates the State Education Fund as a special revenue fund for the purpose
17 of supporting the operation of the public schools in this State and identifies sources of revenue
18 for the Fund, including: (1) all money derived from interest on the State Permanent School
19 Fund, together with all money derived from other sources provided by law; and (2) certain
20 revenues from excise taxes on cannabis or cannabis products or generated from fees imposed
21 on cannabis establishments. (NRS 387.1212, 372A.290, 387.030, 678B.390) Section 3 of this
22 bill requires all money derived from interest on the State Permanent School Fund, together
23 with all money derived from other sources provided by law, to be transferred to the State
24 Education Fund on a quarterly basis. Sections 33 and 34 of this bill likewise require the
25 Department of Taxation and the Cannabis Compliance Board, respectively, to distribute
26 certain revenues from excise taxes on cannabis and cannabis products and fees imposed on
27 cannabis establishments to the State Treasurer on a quarterly basis for deposit in the State
28 Education Fund.]
29 Existing law creates the Education Stabilization Account in the State Education Fund and
30 requires each school district, each year after the close of the previous fiscal year and before
31 the issuance of the State Controller’s annual report, to transfer from the county school district
32 fund to the Education Stabilization Account any amount by which the actual ending fund
33 balance of the county school district fund exceeds 16.6 percent of the total actual expenditures
34 for the fund. (NRS 387.1213) Section 4 of this bill requires each school district to make this
35 transfer after the close of the previous fiscal year and before the close of the then current fiscal
36 year.
37 Existing law establishes certain requirements governing the use of information
38 concerning the average daily enrollment of pupils, including, without limitation: (1)
39 requiring each school district to submit a quarterly report to the Department containing
40 the average daily enrollment of pupils; and (2) providing the method for computing the
41 yearly apportionment to the school district from the State Education Fund. (NRS
42 387.1223) Section 4.5 of this bill applies these provisions to charter schools and
43 university schools for profoundly gifted pupils.
44 Under the Pupil-Centered Funding Plan, existing law requires a public school that
45 receives weighted funding for one or more at-risk pupils or pupils who are English learners to
46 use such funding only to provide services to such pupils, which are referred to as “Victory
47 services” and “Zoom services,” respectively. (NRS 387.121, 387.12445) Section 5 of this bill
48 changes the term “Victory services” to “services for at-risk pupils,” and “Zoom services” to
49 “services for pupils who are English learners.”
50 Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district and the governing body
51 of each charter school to submit to the Superintendent of Public Instruction and certain other
52 recipients, on or before November 1 of each year, a report regarding the budget of the school
53 district or charter school. (NRS 387.303, 388A.345) Existing law requires the Superintendent
54 of Public Instruction, on or before November 25 of each year, to submit a compilation of the
55 reports made by each school district and charter school to the Office of Finance in the Office
56 of the Governor and the Fiscal Analysis Division of the Legislative Counsel Bureau. (NRS
57 387.303, 388A.345) Existing law requires the governing body of a university school for
58 profoundly gifted pupils to submit a similar report to the Department of Education on or
59 before November 15 of each year. (NRS 388C.250) Sections 6, 13 and 15 of this bill require
60 these reports to be submitted annually, on or before the Friday of the first week in January that
61 contains 5 business days. Sections 6 and 13 require the compilation of reports to be submitted
62 on or before the last Friday in January.
63 Existing law requires the Governor, on or before January 1 of each year, to compile a
64 report on the status of the finances of the State, including the information published in the
65 most recent annual report regarding the budget of each school district. (NRS 353.333) Section
66 32 of this bill requires that this report be compiled on or before February 15 of each year, to
67 conform with the change made by section 6 to the date by which the compilation of reports
68 regarding the budget of each school district is required to be submitted to the Office of
69 Finance.

Senate Amendment No. 423 to Senate Bill No. 81 Page 5
70 Existing law requires the clerk of the board of trustees of a county school district to
71 publish a quarterly expenditure report for the school district in a newspaper that meets certain
72 qualifications. (NRS 387.320) Section 7 of this bill requires the expenditure report to instead
73 be published on the Internet website of the county school district.
74 Existing law: (1) provides that the State Board is the sole state agency responsible
75 for the administration of career and technical education; and (2) sets forth actions the
76 State Board is authorized to take in relation to such authority. (NRS 388.360) Section 7.3
77 of this bill authorizes the State Board to request, rather than direct, the Superintendent
78 of Public Instruction to make studies and investigations relating to career and technical
79 education.
80 Existing law requires the Executive Officer of the State Board to designate a
81 program professional to perform certain duties relating to programs of career and
82 technical education that have received grants of money. (NRS 388.396) Section 7.7 of this
83 bill instead requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction to designate a program
84 professional to perform such duties.
85 Existing law authorizes the board of trustees of a school district, with the approval of the
86 juvenile court and the board of county commissioners, to employ qualified teachers for the
87 instruction of children detained in facilities for the detention of children, alternative programs
88 and juvenile forestry camps. (NRS 388.550) Existing law requires the board of trustees of a
89 school district providing such instruction to report to the Superintendent of Public Instruction
90 at such times and in such manner as the Superintendent of Public Instruction prescribes. (NRS
91 388.570) Section 8 of this bill eliminates the requirement for the board of trustees of such a
92 school district to provide such reports to the Superintendent of Public Instruction.
93 Existing law prohibits the ratio of pupils per licensed teacher in certain classes from
94 exceeding certain ratios during each school quarter of a school year. (NRS 388.700) Existing
95 law requires the board of trustees of each school district to report to the Department, on a
96 quarterly basis, the average daily enrollment of pupils and the ratio of pupils per licensed
97 teacher for certain grade levels. (NRS 388.725) If the ratio of pupils per licensed teacher at
98 one or more elementary schools in a school district exceeds the ratio prescribed by statute
99 during any quarter of a school year, existing law requires the school district to request a
100 variance from the State Board for each such school for the subsequent quarter. (NRS 388.700)
101 Section 12 of this bill eliminates the requirement to submit quarterly reports regarding the
102 average daily enrollment of pupils and the ratio of pupils per licensed teacher for certain grade
103 levels and requires the board of trustees of each school district to instead report such
104 information to the Department only on a semiannual basis each year for: (1) the period
105 beginning on July 1 and ending on September 30; and (2) the period beginning on January 1
106 and ending on March 31. Section 9 of this bill requires a school district to request a variance
107 for an elementary school which exceeds the maximum ratio of pupils per licensed teacher only
108 if the ratio is exceeded during a reporting period. Section 9 also: (1) reduces the frequency of
109 the reports regarding variances requested by school districts which the State Board is required
110 to submit to the Interim Finance Committee from quarterly to semiannually; and (2)
111 eliminates the requirement for the State Board to submit a report to the Legislature regarding
112 variances and the data collected by school districts on the effectiveness of plans to reduce
113 pupil-teacher ratios.
114 Existing law requires each school district, in cooperation with the recognized associations
115 representing licensed educational personnel, to develop a plan to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio
116 per class in certain grade levels and submit that plan to the State Board. (NRS 388.720)
117 Section 10 of this bill requires this plan to be submitted to the State Board on or before
118 October 1 of each year.
119 Section 11 of this bill eliminates the requirement for the Department to develop policies
120 and procedures for the distribution of money to each school district for the reduction of pupil-
121 teacher ratios.
122 Existing law requires the sponsor of a charter school that has received, within each of the
123 immediately preceding 3 consecutive school years, one of the two lowest ratings of
124 performance pursuant to the statewide system of accountability for public schools to submit a
125 report to the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Education on or before December 15 of
126 each odd-numbered year describing certain actions taken by the sponsor of the charter school.
127 (NRS 388A.355) Section 14 of this bill requires this report to be submitted annually, on or
128 before February 15.

Senate Amendment No. 423 to Senate Bill No. 81 Page 6
129 Existing law requires: (1) certain charter schools that are approved to operate as
130 empowerment schools to submit a quarterly report to the Department containing certain
131 financial information and information concerning the school’s compliance with its
132 empowerment plan; (2) the board of trustees of a school district and the Department to
133 conduct financial audits of empowerment schools; and (3) such reports and audits concerning
134 empowerment schools to be compiled and forwarded to certain entities. (NRS 388G.200)
135 Section 16 of this bill eliminates these requirements.
136 Existing law authorizes the board of trustees of a school district or the governing body of
137 a charter school to offer a work-based learning program upon the approval of the
138 Superintendent of Public Instruction. (NRS 389.167) Section 17 of this bill eliminates the
139 requirement for a school district or charter school offering a work-based learning program to
140 submit a biennial report to the State Board and the Legislature concerning the manner in
141 which the program has been carried out.
142 Existing law requires the Commission on Professional Standards in Education to
143 prescribe by regulation the qualifications for licensing teachers and other educational
144 personnel. (NRS 391.019) Section 18 of this bill: (1) eliminates the requirement for the
145 Commission to prescribe qualifications for licensing administrators through an alternative
146 route to licensure; and (2) requires the Commission to prescribe qualifications and procedures
147 for licensed teachers and other licensed educational personnel to become licensed as an
148 administrator [.] without restricting the ability of such a person to obtain employment as
149 an administrator.
150 Existing law requires each school district that employs a consultant to submit a report to
151 the Interim Finance Committee at least once every 6 months. (NRS 391.155) Section 19 of
152 this bill reduces the frequency of this report to at least once annually.
153 Existing law: (1) establishes the Teach Nevada Scholarship Program, the Nevada Teacher
154 Advancement Scholarship Program and the Incentivizing Pathways to Teaching Grant
155 Program; and (2) sets forth requirements for the administration of these programs. (NRS
156 391A.550-391A.595, 391A.650-391A.695, 391A.700, 391A.705, 391A.710) Sections 20-31
157 of this bill transfer the administration of these programs from the State Board to the
158 Department. Section 19.3 of this bill requires the Department to create a program of
159 block grants to provide one lump-sum grant to an institution that receives a grant from
160 each of these programs. Section 21 expands the eligibility for Teach Nevada Scholarships to
161 include Nevada residents who graduated from high school in another state or who, before the
162 age of 20, successfully completed the high school equivalency assessment selected by the
163 State Board in another state. Section 26 additionally expands the programs for which a
164 student is eligible to receive a Nevada Teacher Advancement Scholarship to include programs
165 which: (1) result in a certificate of advanced study or other degree which is more advanced
166 than a bachelor’s degree, in education or a related field of study; or (2) upon completion,
167 make a student eligible to obtain a license and endorsement to teach in a subject area for
168 which there is a shortage of teachers. Sections 22 and 27 eliminate the requirement that the
169 recipient of a Teach Nevada Scholarship or Nevada Teacher Advancement Scholarship
170 meet certain requirements to receive the remaining 25 percent of the scholarship that
171 has not been disbursed. Section 27 also makes a conforming change relating to the amount
172 which may be awarded under the Nevada Teacher Advancement Scholarship Program to
173 reflect the additional programs for which a Nevada Teacher Advancement Scholarship may be
174 awarded as provided in section 26. Section 19.7 of this bill creates the Incentivizing
175 Pathways to Teaching Grant Program Account.
176 Section 35 of this bill repeals provisions requiring the Department to: (1) recommend that
177 a minimum amount of money be spent during each fiscal year of the biennium on textbooks,
178 instructional supplies, instructional software and instructional hardware by all school districts,
179 charter schools and university schools for profoundly gifted pupils; and (2) publish a report on
180 school districts, charter schools and university schools for profoundly gifted pupils which did
181 not spend the recommended minimum amount. Section 35 also repeals provisions requiring
182 the board of trustees of each school district to submit an annual report concerning professional
183 development training offered by the school district.

TEXT OF REPEALED SECTIONS
387.206 Recommended minimum expenditure by school districts, charter
schools and university schools for profoundly gifted pupils for textbooks,
instructional supplies, instructional software and instructional hardware.
1. On or before August 1 of each odd-numbered year, the Department, in
consultation with the Budget Division of the Office of Finance and the Fiscal
Analysis Division of the Legislative Counsel Bureau, shall determine a
recommended minimum amount of money to be expended during each fiscal year
of a biennium for textbooks, instructional supplies, instructional software and
instructional hardware by all school districts, charter schools and university schools
for profoundly gifted pupils. The amount must be determined by increasing the
amount that was established for the Fiscal Year 2004-2005 by the percentage of the
change in enrollment between Fiscal Year 2004-2005 and the fiscal year for which
the amount is being established, plus any inflationary adjustment approved by the
Legislature after Fiscal Year 2004-2005.
2. The Department, in consultation with the Budget Division of the Office of
Finance and the Fiscal Analysis Division of the Legislative Counsel Bureau, shall
develop or revise, as applicable, a formula for determining the minimum amount of
money that each school district, charter school and university school for profoundly
gifted pupils is recommended to expend each fiscal year for textbooks, instructional
supplies, instructional software and instructional hardware. The sum of all of the
minimum amounts determined pursuant to this subsection must be equal to the
combined minimum amount determined pursuant to subsection 1. The formula
must be used only to develop expenditure recommendations and must not be used
to alter the yearly apportionment from the State Education Fund to school districts,
charter schools or university schools for profoundly gifted pupils.
3. Upon approval of the formula pursuant to subsection 2, the Department
shall provide written notice to each school district, charter school and university
school for profoundly gifted pupils on or before August 15 of each odd-numbered
year that sets forth the recommended minimum combined amount of money that the
school district, charter school and university school for profoundly gifted pupils
may expend for textbooks, instructional supplies, instructional software and
instructional hardware for each fiscal year of a biennium.
387.2062 Report concerning failure to comply with recommended
minimum expenditure.

Senate Amendment No. 423 to Senate Bill No. 81 Page 40
1. On or before January 1 of each year, the Department shall determine
whether each school district, charter school and university school for profoundly
gifted pupils has expended, during the immediately preceding fiscal year, the
recommended minimum amount of money set forth in the notice provided pursuant
to subsection 3 of NRS 387.206. In making this determination, the Department
shall use the report submitted by:
(a) The school district pursuant to NRS 387.303.
(b) The charter school pursuant to NRS 388A.345.
(c) The university school for profoundly gifted pupils pursuant to NRS
388C.250.
2. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3, if the Department determines
that a school district, charter school or university school for profoundly gifted
pupils, as applicable, has not expended the recommended minimum amount of
money set forth in the notice or the revised notice, as applicable, provided pursuant
to subsection 3 of NRS 387.206, the Department shall publish a report on an
Internet website maintained by the Department which identifies the difference
between the actual combined expenditure for textbooks, instructional supplies,
instructional software and instructional hardware and the minimum recommended
combined expenditure set forth in the notice provided pursuant to subsection 3 of
NRS 387.206.
3. If the actual enrollment of pupils in a school district, charter school or
university school for profoundly gifted pupils is less than the enrollment included in
the projections used in the biennial budget of the school district submitted pursuant
to NRS 387.303, the budget of the charter school submitted pursuant to NRS
388A.345 or the report of the university school for profoundly gifted pupils
submitted pursuant to NRS 388C.250, as applicable, the recommended expenditure
for textbooks, instructional supplies, instructional software and instructional
hardware pursuant to NRS 387.206 must be reduced proportionately.
391A.205 Submission of annual report concerning professional
development training by board of trustees.
1. On or before December 1 of each year, the board of trustees of each school
district shall submit, on a form prescribed by the Department, an annual report
concerning the professional development training offered by the school district to
the State Board, the Commission on Professional Standards in Education, the Joint
Interim Standing Committee on Education and the Legislative Bureau of
Educational Accountability and Program Evaluation.
2. The State Board shall prescribe by regulation the contents of the report
required by subsection 1.
