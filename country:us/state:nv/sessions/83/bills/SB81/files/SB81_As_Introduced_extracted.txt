Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates the Department of Education, which consists of the State

3 Section 1 of this bill requires the Department to create and conduct surveys of: (1)
4 public school employees, assessing school climate and working conditions in

6 school. Section 1 additionally: (1) sets forth when such surveys must be

-

– 2 –
8 surveys; (3) prohibits data collected from such surveys from being used in certain
9 evaluations; (4) requires the Department to recognize schools which achieve a
10 certain response rate on such surveys in the statewide system of accountability; and
11 (5) requires the Department to submit annually to the Commission on School
12 Funding and the State Board a report containing data from the surveys.
13 Existing law requires the principal of each school, in consultation with the
14 employees of the school, to prepare a plan to improve the achievement of the pupils
15 enrolled in the school. (NRS 385A.650) Section 2 of this bill requires the plan to be
16 informed by the results of surveys conducted pursuant to section 1.
17 Existing law creates the State Education Fund as a special revenue fund for the
18 purpose of supporting the operation of the public schools in this State and identifies
19 sources of revenue for the Fund, including: (1) all money derived from interest on
20 the State Permanent School Fund, together with all money derived from other
21 sources provided by law; and (2) certain revenues from excise taxes on cannabis or
22 cannabis products or generated from fees imposed on cannabis establishments.
23 (NRS 387.1212, 372A.290, 387.030, 678B.390) Section 3 of this bill requires all
24 money derived from interest on the State Permanent School Fund, together with all
25 money derived from other sources provided by law, to be transferred to the State
26 Education Fund on a quarterly basis. Sections 33 and 34 of this bill likewise
27 require the Department of Taxation and the Cannabis Compliance Board,
28 respectively, to distribute certain revenues from excise taxes on cannabis and
29 cannabis products and fees imposed on cannabis establishments to the State
30 Treasurer on a quarterly basis for deposit in the State Education Fund.
31 Existing law creates the Education Stabilization Account in the State Education
32 Fund and requires each school district, each year after the close of the previous
33 fiscal year and before the issuance of the State Controller’s annual report, to
34 transfer from the county school district fund to the Education Stabilization Account
35 any amount by which the actual ending fund balance of the county school district
36 fund exceeds 16.6 percent of the total actual expenditures for the fund. (NRS
37 387.1213) Section 4 of this bill requires each school district to make this transfer
38 after the close of the previous fiscal year and before the close of the then current
39 fiscal year.
40 Under the Pupil-Centered Funding Plan, existing law requires a public school
41 that receives weighted funding for one or more at-risk pupils or pupils who are
42 English learners to use such funding only to provide services to such pupils, which
43 are referred to as “Victory services” and “Zoom services,” respectively. (NRS
44 387.121, 387.12445) Section 5 of this bill changes the term “Victory services” to
45 “services for at-risk pupils,” and “Zoom services” to “services for pupils who are
46 English learners.”
47 Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district and the
48 governing body of each charter school to submit to the Superintendent of Public
49 Instruction and certain other recipients, on or before November 1 of each year, a
50 report regarding the budget of the school district or charter school. (NRS 387.303,
51 388A.345) Existing law requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction, on or
52 before November 25 of each year, to submit a compilation of the reports made by
53 each school district and charter school to the Office of Finance in the Office of the
54 Governor and the Fiscal Analysis Division of the Legislative Counsel Bureau.
55 (NRS 387.303, 388A.345) Existing law requires the governing body of a university
56 school for profoundly gifted pupils to submit a similar report to the Department of
57 Education on or before November 15 of each year. (NRS 388C.250) Sections 6, 13
58 and 15 of this bill require these reports to be submitted annually, on or before the
59 Friday of the first week in January that contains 5 business days. Sections 6 and 13
60 require the compilation of reports to be submitted on or before the last Friday in
61 January.

*SB81*
– 3 –
62 Existing law requires the Governor, on or before January 1 of each year, to
63 compile a report on the status of the finances of the State, including the information
64 published in the most recent annual report regarding the budget of each school
65 district. (NRS 353.333) Section 32 of this bill requires that this report be compiled
66 on or before February 15 of each year, to conform with the change made by section
67 6 to the date by which the compilation of reports regarding the budget of each
68 school district is required to be submitted to the Office of Finance.
69 Existing law requires the clerk of the board of trustees of a county school
70 district to publish a quarterly expenditure report for the school district in a
71 newspaper that meets certain qualifications. (NRS 387.320) Section 7 of this bill
72 requires the expenditure report to instead be published on the Internet website of
73 the county school district.
74 Existing law authorizes the board of trustees of a school district, with the
75 approval of the juvenile court and the board of county commissioners, to employ
76 qualified teachers for the instruction of children detained in facilities for the
77 detention of children, alternative programs and juvenile forestry camps. (NRS
78 388.550) Existing law requires the board of trustees of a school district providing
79 such instruction to report to the Superintendent of Public Instruction at such times
80 and in such manner as the Superintendent of Public Instruction prescribes. (NRS
81 388.570) Section 8 of this bill eliminates the requirement for the board of trustees
82 of such a school district to provide such reports to the Superintendent of Public
83 Instruction.
84 Existing law prohibits the ratio of pupils per licensed teacher in certain classes
85 from exceeding certain ratios during each school quarter of a school year. (NRS
86 388.700) Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district to report
87 to the Department, on a quarterly basis, the average daily enrollment of pupils and
88 the ratio of pupils per licensed teacher for certain grade levels. (NRS 388.725) If
89 the ratio of pupils per licensed teacher at one or more elementary schools in a
90 school district exceeds the ratio prescribed by statute during any quarter of a school
91 year, existing law requires the school district to request a variance from the State
92 Board for each such school for the subsequent quarter. (NRS 388.700) Section 12
93 of this bill eliminates the requirement to submit quarterly reports regarding the
94 average daily enrollment of pupils and the ratio of pupils per licensed teacher for
95 certain grade levels and requires the board of trustees of each school district to
96 instead report such information to the Department only on a semiannual basis each
97 year for: (1) the period beginning on July 1 and ending on September 30; and (2)
98 the period beginning on January 1 and ending on March 31. Section 9 of this bill
99 requires a school district to request a variance for an elementary school which
100 exceeds the maximum ratio of pupils per licensed teacher only if the ratio is
101 exceeded during a reporting period. Section 9 also: (1) reduces the frequency of the
102 reports regarding variances requested by school districts which the State Board is
103 required to submit to the Interim Finance Committee from quarterly to
104 semiannually; and (2) eliminates the requirement for the State Board to submit a
105 report to the Legislature regarding variances and the data collected by school
106 districts on the effectiveness of plans to reduce pupil-teacher ratios.
107 Existing law requires each school district, in cooperation with the recognized
108 associations representing licensed educational personnel, to develop a plan to
109 reduce the pupil-teacher ratio per class in certain grade levels and submit that plan
110 to the State Board. (NRS 388.720) Section 10 of this bill requires this plan to be
111 submitted to the State Board on or before October 1 of each year.
112 Section 11 of this bill eliminates the requirement for the Department to develop
113 policies and procedures for the distribution of money to each school district for the
114 reduction of pupil-teacher ratios.
115 Existing law requires the sponsor of a charter school that has received, within
116 each of the immediately preceding 3 consecutive school years, one of the two
-
*SB81*
– 4 –
117 lowest ratings of performance pursuant to the statewide system of accountability for
118 public schools to submit a report to the Joint Interim Standing Committee on
119 Education on or before December 15 of each odd-numbered year describing certain
120 actions taken by the sponsor of the charter school. (NRS 388A.355) Section 14 of
121 this bill requires this report to be submitted annually, on or before February 15.
122 Existing law requires: (1) certain charter schools that are approved to operate as
123 empowerment schools to submit a quarterly report to the Department containing
124 certain financial information and information concerning the school’s compliance
125 with its empowerment plan; (2) the board of trustees of a school district and the
126 Department to conduct financial audits of empowerment schools; and (3) such
127 reports and audits concerning empowerment schools to be compiled and forwarded
128 to certain entities. (NRS 388G.200) Section 16 of this bill eliminates these
129 requirements.
130 Existing law authorizes the board of trustees of a school district or the
131 governing body of a charter school to offer a work-based learning program upon
132 the approval of the Superintendent of Public Instruction. (NRS 389.167) Section 17
133 of this bill eliminates the requirement for a school district or charter school offering
134 a work-based learning program to submit a biennial report to the State Board and
135 the Legislature concerning the manner in which the program has been carried out.
136 Existing law requires the Commission on Professional Standards in Education
137 to prescribe by regulation the qualifications for licensing teachers and other
138 educational personnel. (NRS 391.019) Section 18 of this bill: (1) eliminates the
139 requirement for the Commission to prescribe qualifications for licensing
140 administrators through an alternative route to licensure; and (2) requires the
141 Commission to prescribe qualifications and procedures for licensed teachers and
142 other licensed educational personnel to become licensed as an administrator.
143 Existing law requires each school district that employs a consultant to submit a
144 report to the Interim Finance Committee at least once every 6 months. (NRS
145 391.155) Section 19 of this bill reduces the frequency of this report to at least once
146 annually.
147 Existing law: (1) establishes the Teach Nevada Scholarship Program, the
148 Nevada Teacher Advancement Scholarship Program and the Incentivizing
149 Pathways to Teaching Grant Program; and (2) sets forth requirements for the
150 administration of these programs. (NRS 391A.550-391A.595, 391A.650-391A.695,
151 391A.700, 391A.705, 391A.710) Sections 20-31 of this bill transfer the
152 administration of these programs from the State Board to the Department. Section
153 21 expands the eligibility for Teach Nevada Scholarships to include Nevada
154 residents who graduated from high school in another state or who, before the age of
155 20, successfully completed the high school equivalency assessment selected by the
156 State Board in another state. Section 26 additionally expands the programs for
157 which a student is eligible to receive a Nevada Teacher Advancement Scholarship
158 to include programs which: (1) result in a certificate of advanced study or other
159 degree which is more advanced than a bachelor’s degree, in education or a related
160 field of study; or (2) upon completion, make a student eligible to obtain a license
161 and endorsement to teach in a subject area for which there is a shortage of teachers.
162 Section 27 makes a conforming change relating to the amount which may be
163 awarded under the Nevada Teacher Advancement Scholarship Program to reflect
164 the additional programs for which a Nevada Teacher Advancement Scholarship
165 may be awarded as provided in section 26.
166 Section 35 of this bill repeals provisions requiring the Department to: (1)
167 recommend that a minimum amount of money be spent during each fiscal year of
168 the biennium on textbooks, instructional supplies, instructional software and
169 instructional hardware by all school districts, charter schools and university schools
170 for profoundly gifted pupils; and (2) publish a report on school districts, charter
171 schools and university schools for profoundly gifted pupils which did not spend the
-
*SB81*
– 5 –
172 recommended minimum amount. Section 35 also repeals provisions requiring the
173 board of trustees of each school district to submit an annual report concerning
174 professional development training offered by the school district.

32 enrollment growth by an amount that the Interim Finance
33 Committee determines would make a transfer of money to the State

19 available in the State Education Fund because of a delay in expected
20 receipts, he or she may request from the Director of the Office of
21 Finance a temporary advance from the Education Stabilization
22 Account for the payment of such money due. Upon receipt of such a

37 Account, that has not been committed for expenditure on or before
38 June 30 of an odd-numbered fiscal year must be transferred to the

42 Sec. 5. NRS 387.12445 is hereby amended to read as follows:
43 387.12445 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2,

16 (b) or (e) of subsection 2 of NRS 387.1214 or NRS 387.122.
17 2. If a school district determines that an additional amount of
18 money is necessary to satisfy requirements for maintenance of effort
19 or any other requirement under federal law for pupils with
20 disabilities enrolled in the school district, the school district may
21 transfer the necessary amount of money from the adjusted base per
22 pupil funding received by the school district for that purpose.
23 3. Each school district shall ensure that all weighted funding
24 received by the school district pursuant to paragraph (e) of
25 subsection 2 of NRS 387.1214 is accounted for separately and
26 distributed directly to each school in which the relevant pupils are
27 estimated to be enrolled.
28 4. Each public school shall account separately for the local
29 funding for pupils with disabilities received by the public school
30 pursuant to paragraph (b) of subsection 2 of NRS 387.1214, for the
31 adjusted base per pupil funding received by the public school
32 pursuant to paragraph (c) of subsection 2 of NRS 387.1214, for each

34 to paragraph (e) of subsection 2 of NRS 387.1214 and for money
35 received from the statewide multiplier pursuant to NRS 387.122.
36 Unless the provisions of subsection 7 or 8 impose greater

39 relevant pupil:
40 (a) As a supplement to the adjusted base per pupil funding
41 received for the pupil; and
42 (b) Solely for the purpose of providing such additional
43 educational programs, services or support as are necessary to ensure
44 the pupil receives a reasonably equal educational opportunity.

TEXT OF REPEALED SECTIONS

Section 2:
387.206 Recommended minimum expenditure by school
districts, charter schools and university schools for profoundly
gifted pupils for textbooks, instructional supplies, instructional
software and instructional hardware.

Section 3:
1. On or before August 1 of each odd-numbered year, the
Department, in consultation with the Budget Division of the Office
of Finance and the Fiscal Analysis Division of the Legislative
Counsel Bureau, shall determine a recommended minimum amount
of money to be expended during each fiscal year of a biennium for
textbooks, instructional supplies, instructional software and
instructional hardware by all school districts, charter schools and
university schools for profoundly gifted pupils. The amount must be
determined by increasing the amount that was established for the
Fiscal Year 2004-2005 by the percentage of the change in
enrollment between Fiscal Year 2004-2005 and the fiscal year for
which the amount is being established, plus any inflationary
adjustment approved by the Legislature after Fiscal Year
2004-2005.

Section 4:
2. The Department, in consultation with the Budget Division of
the Office of Finance and the Fiscal Analysis Division of the
Legislative Counsel Bureau, shall develop or revise, as applicable, a

gifted pupils is recommended to expend each fiscal year for
textbooks, instructional supplies, instructional software and
-
*SB81*
– 46 –
instructional hardware. The sum of all of the minimum amounts
determined pursuant to this subsection must be equal to the
combined minimum amount determined pursuant to subsection 1.
The formula must be used only to develop expenditure
recommendations and must not be used to alter the yearly
apportionment from the State Education Fund to school districts,
charter schools or university schools for profoundly gifted pupils.

Section 5:
3. Upon approval of the formula pursuant to subsection 2, the
Department shall provide written notice to each school district,
charter school and university school for profoundly gifted pupils on
or before August 15 of each odd-numbered year that sets forth the
recommended minimum combined amount of money that the school
district, charter school and university school for profoundly gifted
pupils may expend for textbooks, instructional supplies,

subsection 3 of NRS 387.206. In making this determination, the
Department shall use the report submitted by:
(a) The school district pursuant to NRS 387.303.
(b) The charter school pursuant to NRS 388A.345.
(c) The university school for profoundly gifted pupils pursuant
to NRS 388C.250.

Section 8:
2. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3, if the
Department determines that a school district, charter school or
university school for profoundly gifted pupils, as applicable, has not
expended the recommended minimum amount of money set forth in
the notice or the revised notice, as applicable, provided pursuant to
subsection 3 of NRS 387.206, the Department shall publish a report
on an Internet website maintained by the Department which
identifies the difference between the actual combined expenditure
for textbooks, instructional supplies, instructional software and
instructional hardware and the minimum recommended combined
expenditure set forth in the notice provided pursuant to subsection 3
of NRS 387.206.

Section 9:
3. If the actual enrollment of pupils in a school district, charter
school or university school for profoundly gifted pupils is less than
the enrollment included in the projections used in the biennial
budget of the school district submitted pursuant to NRS 387.303, the
-
*SB81*
– 47 –
budget of the charter school submitted pursuant to NRS 388A.345
or the report of the university school for profoundly gifted pupils
submitted pursuant to NRS 388C.250, as applicable, the
recommended expenditure for textbooks, instructional supplies,
instructional software and instructional hardware pursuant to NRS

Section 10:
387.206 must be reduced proportionately.
391A.205 Submission of annual report concerning
professional development training by board of trustees.

development training offered by the school district to the State
Board, the Commission on Professional Standards in Education, the

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates the Department of Education, which consists of the State
2 Board of Education and the Superintendent of Public Instruction. (NRS 385.010)
3 Section 1 of this bill requires the Department to create and conduct surveys of: (1)
4 public school employees, assessing school climate and working conditions in
5 schools; and (2) public school employees who are leaving employment at a public
6 school. Section 1 additionally: (1) sets forth when such surveys must be
7 administered; (2) sets forth how a school district must use the results of such
-
*SB81*

– 2 –
8 surveys; (3) prohibits data collected from such surveys from being used in certain
9 evaluations; (4) requires the Department to recognize schools which achieve a
10 certain response rate on such surveys in the statewide system of accountability; and
11 (5) requires the Department to submit annually to the Commission on School
12 Funding and the State Board a report containing data from the surveys.
13 Existing law requires the principal of each school, in consultation with the
14 employees of the school, to prepare a plan to improve the achievement of the pupils
15 enrolled in the school. (NRS 385A.650) Section 2 of this bill requires the plan to be
16 informed by the results of surveys conducted pursuant to section 1.
17 Existing law creates the State Education Fund as a special revenue fund for the
18 purpose of supporting the operation of the public schools in this State and identifies
19 sources of revenue for the Fund, including: (1) all money derived from interest on
20 the State Permanent School Fund, together with all money derived from other
21 sources provided by law; and (2) certain revenues from excise taxes on cannabis or
22 cannabis products or generated from fees imposed on cannabis establishments.
23 (NRS 387.1212, 372A.290, 387.030, 678B.390) Section 3 of this bill requires all
24 money derived from interest on the State Permanent School Fund, together with all
25 money derived from other sources provided by law, to be transferred to the State
26 Education Fund on a quarterly basis. Sections 33 and 34 of this bill likewise
27 require the Department of Taxation and the Cannabis Compliance Board,
28 respectively, to distribute certain revenues from excise taxes on cannabis and
29 cannabis products and fees imposed on cannabis establishments to the State
30 Treasurer on a quarterly basis for deposit in the State Education Fund.
31 Existing law creates the Education Stabilization Account in the State Education
32 Fund and requires each school district, each year after the close of the previous
33 fiscal year and before the issuance of the State Controller’s annual report, to
34 transfer from the county school district fund to the Education Stabilization Account
35 any amount by which the actual ending fund balance of the county school district
36 fund exceeds 16.6 percent of the total actual expenditures for the fund. (NRS
37 387.1213) Section 4 of this bill requires each school district to make this transfer
38 after the close of the previous fiscal year and before the close of the then current
39 fiscal year.
40 Under the Pupil-Centered Funding Plan, existing law requires a public school
41 that receives weighted funding for one or more at-risk pupils or pupils who are
42 English learners to use such funding only to provide services to such pupils, which
43 are referred to as “Victory services” and “Zoom services,” respectively. (NRS
44 387.121, 387.12445) Section 5 of this bill changes the term “Victory services” to
45 “services for at-risk pupils,” and “Zoom services” to “services for pupils who are
46 English learners.”
47 Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district and the
48 governing body of each charter school to submit to the Superintendent of Public
49 Instruction and certain other recipients, on or before November 1 of each year, a
50 report regarding the budget of the school district or charter school. (NRS 387.303,
51 388A.345) Existing law requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction, on or
52 before November 25 of each year, to submit a compilation of the reports made by
53 each school district and charter school to the Office of Finance in the Office of the
54 Governor and the Fiscal Analysis Division of the Legislative Counsel Bureau.
55 (NRS 387.303, 388A.345) Existing law requires the governing body of a university
56 school for profoundly gifted pupils to submit a similar report to the Department of
57 Education on or before November 15 of each year. (NRS 388C.250) Sections 6, 13
58 and 15 of this bill require these reports to be submitted annually, on or before the
59 Friday of the first week in January that contains 5 business days. Sections 6 and 13
60 require the compilation of reports to be submitted on or before the last Friday in
61 January.
-
*SB81*

– 3 –
62 Existing law requires the Governor, on or before January 1 of each year, to
63 compile a report on the status of the finances of the State, including the information
64 published in the most recent annual report regarding the budget of each school
65 district. (NRS 353.333) Section 32 of this bill requires that this report be compiled
66 on or before February 15 of each year, to conform with the change made by section
67 6 to the date by which the compilation of reports regarding the budget of each
68 school district is required to be submitted to the Office of Finance.
69 Existing law requires the clerk of the board of trustees of a county school
70 district to publish a quarterly expenditure report for the school district in a
71 newspaper that meets certain qualifications. (NRS 387.320) Section 7 of this bill
72 requires the expenditure report to instead be published on the Internet website of
73 the county school district.
74 Existing law authorizes the board of trustees of a school district, with the
75 approval of the juvenile court and the board of county commissioners, to employ
76 qualified teachers for the instruction of children detained in facilities for the
77 detention of children, alternative programs and juvenile forestry camps. (NRS
78 388.550) Existing law requires the board of trustees of a school district providing
79 such instruction to report to the Superintendent of Public Instruction at such times
80 and in such manner as the Superintendent of Public Instruction prescribes. (NRS
81 388.570) Section 8 of this bill eliminates the requirement for the board of trustees
82 of such a school district to provide such reports to the Superintendent of Public
83 Instruction.
84 Existing law prohibits the ratio of pupils per licensed teacher in certain classes
85 from exceeding certain ratios during each school quarter of a school year. (NRS
86 388.700) Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district to report
87 to the Department, on a quarterly basis, the average daily enrollment of pupils and
88 the ratio of pupils per licensed teacher for certain grade levels. (NRS 388.725) If
89 the ratio of pupils per licensed teacher at one or more elementary schools in a
90 school district exceeds the ratio prescribed by statute during any quarter of a school
91 year, existing law requires the school district to request a variance from the State
92 Board for each such school for the subsequent quarter. (NRS 388.700) Section 12
93 of this bill eliminates the requirement to submit quarterly reports regarding the
94 average daily enrollment of pupils and the ratio of pupils per licensed teacher for
95 certain grade levels and requires the board of trustees of each school district to
96 instead report such information to the Department only on a semiannual basis each
97 year for: (1) the period beginning on July 1 and ending on September 30; and (2)
98 the period beginning on January 1 and ending on March 31. Section 9 of this bill
99 requires a school district to request a variance for an elementary school which
100 exceeds the maximum ratio of pupils per licensed teacher only if the ratio is
101 exceeded during a reporting period. Section 9 also: (1) reduces the frequency of the
102 reports regarding variances requested by school districts which the State Board is
103 required to submit to the Interim Finance Committee from quarterly to
104 semiannually; and (2) eliminates the requirement for the State Board to submit a
105 report to the Legislature regarding variances and the data collected by school
106 districts on the effectiveness of plans to reduce pupil-teacher ratios.
107 Existing law requires each school district, in cooperation with the recognized
108 associations representing licensed educational personnel, to develop a plan to
109 reduce the pupil-teacher ratio per class in certain grade levels and submit that plan
110 to the State Board. (NRS 388.720) Section 10 of this bill requires this plan to be
111 submitted to the State Board on or before October 1 of each year.
112 Section 11 of this bill eliminates the requirement for the Department to develop
113 policies and procedures for the distribution of money to each school district for the
114 reduction of pupil-teacher ratios.
115 Existing law requires the sponsor of a charter school that has received, within
116 each of the immediately preceding 3 consecutive school years, one of the two
-
*SB81*

– 4 –
117 lowest ratings of performance pursuant to the statewide system of accountability for
118 public schools to submit a report to the Joint Interim Standing Committee on
119 Education on or before December 15 of each odd-numbered year describing certain
120 actions taken by the sponsor of the charter school. (NRS 388A.355) Section 14 of
121 this bill requires this report to be submitted annually, on or before February 15.
122 Existing law requires: (1) certain charter schools that are approved to operate as
123 empowerment schools to submit a quarterly report to the Department containing
124 certain financial information and information concerning the school’s compliance
125 with its empowerment plan; (2) the board of trustees of a school district and the
126 Department to conduct financial audits of empowerment schools; and (3) such
127 reports and audits concerning empowerment schools to be compiled and forwarded
128 to certain entities. (NRS 388G.200) Section 16 of this bill eliminates these
129 requirements.
130 Existing law authorizes the board of trustees of a school district or the
131 governing body of a charter school to offer a work-based learning program upon
132 the approval of the Superintendent of Public Instruction. (NRS 389.167) Section 17
133 of this bill eliminates the requirement for a school district or charter school offering
134 a work-based learning program to submit a biennial report to the State Board and
135 the Legislature concerning the manner in which the program has been carried out.
136 Existing law requires the Commission on Professional Standards in Education
137 to prescribe by regulation the qualifications for licensing teachers and other
138 educational personnel. (NRS 391.019) Section 18 of this bill: (1) eliminates the
139 requirement for the Commission to prescribe qualifications for licensing
140 administrators through an alternative route to licensure; and (2) requires the
141 Commission to prescribe qualifications and procedures for licensed teachers and
142 other licensed educational personnel to become licensed as an administrator.
143 Existing law requires each school district that employs a consultant to submit a
144 report to the Interim Finance Committee at least once every 6 months. (NRS
145 391.155) Section 19 of this bill reduces the frequency of this report to at least once
146 annually.
147 Existing law: (1) establishes the Teach Nevada Scholarship Program, the
148 Nevada Teacher Advancement Scholarship Program and the Incentivizing
149 Pathways to Teaching Grant Program; and (2) sets forth requirements for the
150 administration of these programs. (NRS 391A.550-391A.595, 391A.650-391A.695,
151 391A.700, 391A.705, 391A.710) Sections 20-31 of this bill transfer the
152 administration of these programs from the State Board to the Department. Section
153 21 expands the eligibility for Teach Nevada Scholarships to include Nevada
154 residents who graduated from high school in another state or who, before the age of
155 20, successfully completed the high school equivalency assessment selected by the
156 State Board in another state. Section 26 additionally expands the programs for
157 which a student is eligible to receive a Nevada Teacher Advancement Scholarship
158 to include programs which: (1) result in a certificate of advanced study or other
159 degree which is more advanced than a bachelor’s degree, in education or a related
160 field of study; or (2) upon completion, make a student eligible to obtain a license
161 and endorsement to teach in a subject area for which there is a shortage of teachers.
162 Section 27 makes a conforming change relating to the amount which may be
163 awarded under the Nevada Teacher Advancement Scholarship Program to reflect
164 the additional programs for which a Nevada Teacher Advancement Scholarship
165 may be awarded as provided in section 26.
166 Section 35 of this bill repeals provisions requiring the Department to: (1)
167 recommend that a minimum amount of money be spent during each fiscal year of
168 the biennium on textbooks, instructional supplies, instructional software and
169 instructional hardware by all school districts, charter schools and university schools
170 for profoundly gifted pupils; and (2) publish a report on school districts, charter
171 schools and university schools for profoundly gifted pupils which did not spend the
-
*SB81*

– 5 –
172 recommended minimum amount. Section 35 also repeals provisions requiring the
173 board of trustees of each school district to submit an annual report concerning
174 professional development training offered by the school district.

TEXT OF REPEALED SECTIONS
387.206 Recommended minimum expenditure by school
districts, charter schools and university schools for profoundly
gifted pupils for textbooks, instructional supplies, instructional
software and instructional hardware.
1. On or before August 1 of each odd-numbered year, the
Department, in consultation with the Budget Division of the Office
of Finance and the Fiscal Analysis Division of the Legislative
Counsel Bureau, shall determine a recommended minimum amount
of money to be expended during each fiscal year of a biennium for
textbooks, instructional supplies, instructional software and
instructional hardware by all school districts, charter schools and
university schools for profoundly gifted pupils. The amount must be
determined by increasing the amount that was established for the
Fiscal Year 2004-2005 by the percentage of the change in
enrollment between Fiscal Year 2004-2005 and the fiscal year for
which the amount is being established, plus any inflationary
adjustment approved by the Legislature after Fiscal Year
2004-2005.
2. The Department, in consultation with the Budget Division of
the Office of Finance and the Fiscal Analysis Division of the
Legislative Counsel Bureau, shall develop or revise, as applicable, a
formula for determining the minimum amount of money that each
school district, charter school and university school for profoundly
gifted pupils is recommended to expend each fiscal year for
textbooks, instructional supplies, instructional software and
-
*SB81*

– 46 –
instructional hardware. The sum of all of the minimum amounts
determined pursuant to this subsection must be equal to the
combined minimum amount determined pursuant to subsection 1.
The formula must be used only to develop expenditure
recommendations and must not be used to alter the yearly
apportionment from the State Education Fund to school districts,
charter schools or university schools for profoundly gifted pupils.
3. Upon approval of the formula pursuant to subsection 2, the
Department shall provide written notice to each school district,
charter school and university school for profoundly gifted pupils on
or before August 15 of each odd-numbered year that sets forth the
recommended minimum combined amount of money that the school
district, charter school and university school for profoundly gifted
pupils may expend for textbooks, instructional supplies,
instructional software and instructional hardware for each fiscal year
of a biennium.
387.2062 Report concerning failure to comply with
recommended minimum expenditure.
1. On or before January 1 of each year, the Department shall
determine whether each school district, charter school and university
school for profoundly gifted pupils has expended, during the
immediately preceding fiscal year, the recommended minimum
amount of money set forth in the notice provided pursuant to
subsection 3 of NRS 387.206. In making this determination, the
Department shall use the report submitted by:
(a) The school district pursuant to NRS 387.303.
(b) The charter school pursuant to NRS 388A.345.
(c) The university school for profoundly gifted pupils pursuant
to NRS 388C.250.
2. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3, if the
Department determines that a school district, charter school or
university school for profoundly gifted pupils, as applicable, has not
expended the recommended minimum amount of money set forth in
the notice or the revised notice, as applicable, provided pursuant to
subsection 3 of NRS 387.206, the Department shall publish a report
on an Internet website maintained by the Department which
identifies the difference between the actual combined expenditure
for textbooks, instructional supplies, instructional software and
instructional hardware and the minimum recommended combined
expenditure set forth in the notice provided pursuant to subsection 3
of NRS 387.206.
3. If the actual enrollment of pupils in a school district, charter
school or university school for profoundly gifted pupils is less than
the enrollment included in the projections used in the biennial
budget of the school district submitted pursuant to NRS 387.303, the
-
*SB81*

– 47 –
budget of the charter school submitted pursuant to NRS 388A.345
or the report of the university school for profoundly gifted pupils
submitted pursuant to NRS 388C.250, as applicable, the
recommended expenditure for textbooks, instructional supplies,
instructional software and instructional hardware pursuant to NRS
387.206 must be reduced proportionately.
391A.205 Submission of annual report concerning
professional development training by board of trustees.
1. On or before December 1 of each year, the board of trustees
of each school district shall submit, on a form prescribed by the
Department, an annual report concerning the professional
development training offered by the school district to the State
Board, the Commission on Professional Standards in Education, the
Joint Interim Standing Committee on Education and the Legislative
Bureau of Educational Accountability and Program Evaluation.
2. The State Board shall prescribe by regulation the contents of
the report required by subsection 1.
