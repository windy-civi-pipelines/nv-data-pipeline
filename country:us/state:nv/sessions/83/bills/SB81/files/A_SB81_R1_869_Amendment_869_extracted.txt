Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates the Department of Education, which consists of the State Board of
2 Education and the Superintendent of Public Instruction. (NRS 385.010) Section 1 of this bill
3 requires the Department to create and conduct surveys of: (1) public school employees,
4 assessing school climate and working conditions in schools; and (2) public school employees
5 who are leaving employment at a public school. Section 1 additionally: (1) sets forth when
6 such surveys must be administered; (2) sets forth how a school district must use the results of
7 such surveys; (3) prohibits data collected from such surveys from being used in certain
8 evaluations; (4) requires the Department to recognize schools which achieve a certain
9 response rate on such surveys in the statewide system of accountability; and (5) requires the
10 Department to submit annually to the Commission on School Funding and the State Board a
11 report containing data from the surveys.
Senate Amendment No. 869 to Senate Bill No. 81 First Reprint Page 4
12 Existing law requires the principal of each school, in consultation with the employees of
13 the school, to prepare a plan to improve the achievement of the pupils enrolled in the school.
14 (NRS 385A.650) Section 2 of this bill requires the plan to be informed by the results of
15 surveys conducted pursuant to section 1.
16 Existing law creates the Education Stabilization Account in the State Education Fund and
17 requires each school district, each year after the close of the previous fiscal year and before
18 the issuance of the State Controller’s annual report, to transfer from the county school district
19 fund to the Education Stabilization Account any amount by which the actual ending fund
20 balance of the county school district fund exceeds 16.6 percent of the total actual expenditures
21 for the fund. (NRS 387.1213) Section 4 of this bill requires each school district to make this
22 transfer after the close of the previous fiscal year and before the close of the then current fiscal
23 year.
24 Existing law establishes certain requirements governing the use of information
25 concerning the average daily enrollment of pupils, including, without limitation: (1) requiring
26 each school district to submit a quarterly report to the Department containing the average
27 daily enrollment of pupils; and (2) providing the method for computing the yearly
28 apportionment to the school district from the State Education Fund. (NRS 387.1223) Section
29 4.5 of this bill applies these provisions to charter schools and university schools for
30 profoundly gifted pupils.
31 Under the Pupil-Centered Funding Plan, existing law requires a public school that
32 receives weighted funding for one or more at-risk pupils or pupils who are English learners to
33 use such funding only to provide services to such pupils, which are referred to as “Victory
34 services” and “Zoom services,” respectively. (NRS 387.121, 387.12445) Section 5 of this bill
35 changes the term “Victory services” to “services for at-risk pupils,” and “Zoom services” to
36 “services for pupils who are English learners.”
37 Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district and the governing body
38 of each charter school to submit to the Superintendent of Public Instruction and certain other
39 recipients, on or before November 1 of each year, a report regarding the budget of the school
40 district or charter school. (NRS 387.303, 388A.345) Existing law requires the Superintendent
41 of Public Instruction, on or before November 25 of each year, to submit a compilation of the
42 reports made by each school district and charter school to the Office of Finance in the Office
43 of the Governor and the Fiscal Analysis Division of the Legislative Counsel Bureau. (NRS
44 387.303, 388A.345) Existing law requires the governing body of a university school for
45 profoundly gifted pupils to submit a similar report to the Department of Education on or
46 before November 15 of each year. (NRS 388C.250) Sections 6, 13 and 15 of this bill require
47 these reports to be submitted annually, on or before the Friday of the first week in January that
48 contains 5 business days. Sections 6 and 13 require the compilation of reports to be submitted
49 on or before the last Friday in January.
50 Existing law requires the Governor, on or before January 1 of each year, to compile a
51 report on the status of the finances of the State, including the information published in the
52 most recent annual report regarding the budget of each school district. (NRS 353.333) Section
53 32 of this bill requires that this report be compiled on or before February 15 of each year, to
54 conform with the change made by section 6 to the date by which the compilation of reports
55 regarding the budget of each school district is required to be submitted to the Office of
56 Finance.
57 Existing law requires the clerk of the board of trustees of a county school district to
58 publish a quarterly expenditure report for the school district in a newspaper that meets certain
59 qualifications. (NRS 387.320) Section 7 of this bill requires the expenditure report to instead
60 be published on the Internet website of the county school district.
61 Existing law: (1) provides that the State Board is the sole state agency responsible for the
62 administration of career and technical education; and (2) sets forth actions the State Board is
63 authorized to take in relation to such authority. (NRS 388.360) Section 7.3 of this bill
64 authorizes the State Board to request, rather than direct, the Superintendent of Public
65 Instruction to make studies and investigations relating to career and technical education.
66 Existing law requires the Executive Officer of the State Board to designate a program
67 professional to perform certain duties relating to programs of career and technical education
68 that have received grants of money. (NRS 388.396) Section 7.7 of this bill instead requires the
69 Superintendent of Public Instruction to designate a program professional to perform such
70 duties.
Senate Amendment No. 869 to Senate Bill No. 81 First Reprint Page 5
71 Existing law authorizes the board of trustees of a school district, with the approval of the
72 juvenile court and the board of county commissioners, to employ qualified teachers for the
73 instruction of children detained in facilities for the detention of children, alternative programs
74 and juvenile forestry camps. (NRS 388.550) Existing law requires the board of trustees of a
75 school district providing such instruction to report to the Superintendent of Public Instruction
76 at such times and in such manner as the Superintendent of Public Instruction prescribes. (NRS
77 388.570) Section 8 of this bill eliminates the requirement for the board of trustees of such a
78 school district to provide such reports to the Superintendent of Public Instruction.
79 Existing law prohibits the ratio of pupils per licensed teacher in certain classes from
80 exceeding certain ratios during each school quarter of a school year. (NRS 388.700) Existing
81 law requires the board of trustees of each school district to report to the Department, on a
82 quarterly basis, the average daily enrollment of pupils and the ratio of pupils per licensed
83 teacher for certain grade levels. (NRS 388.725) If the ratio of pupils per licensed teacher at
84 one or more elementary schools in a school district exceeds the ratio prescribed by statute
85 during any quarter of a school year, existing law requires the school district to request a
86 variance from the State Board for each such school for the subsequent quarter. (NRS 388.700)
87 Section 12 of this bill eliminates the requirement to submit quarterly reports regarding the
88 average daily enrollment of pupils and the ratio of pupils per licensed teacher for certain grade
89 levels and requires the board of trustees of each school district to instead report such
90 information to the Department only on a semiannual basis each year for: (1) the period
91 beginning on July 1 and ending on September 30; and (2) the period beginning on January 1
92 and ending on March 31. Section 9 of this bill requires a school district to request a variance
93 for an elementary school which exceeds the maximum ratio of pupils per licensed teacher only
94 if the ratio is exceeded during a reporting period. Section 9 also: (1) reduces the frequency of
95 the reports regarding variances requested by school districts which the State Board is required
96 to submit to the Interim Finance Committee from quarterly to semiannually; and (2)
97 eliminates the requirement for the State Board to submit a report to the Legislature regarding
98 variances and the data collected by school districts on the effectiveness of plans to reduce
99 pupil-teacher ratios.
100 Existing law requires each school district, in cooperation with the recognized associations
101 representing licensed educational personnel, to develop a plan to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio
102 per class in certain grade levels and submit that plan to the State Board. (NRS 388.720)
103 Section 10 of this bill requires this plan to be submitted to the State Board on or before
104 October 1 of each year.
105 Section 11 of this bill eliminates the requirement for the Department to develop policies
106 and procedures for the distribution of money to each school district for the reduction of pupil-
107 teacher ratios.
108 Existing law requires the sponsor of a charter school that has received, within each of the
109 immediately preceding 3 consecutive school years, one of the two lowest ratings of
110 performance pursuant to the statewide system of accountability for public schools to submit a
111 report to the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Education on or before December 15 of
112 each odd-numbered year describing certain actions taken by the sponsor of the charter school.
113 (NRS 388A.355) Section 14 of this bill requires this report to be submitted annually, on or
114 before February 15.
115 Existing law requires: (1) certain charter schools that are approved to operate as
116 empowerment schools to submit a quarterly report to the Department containing certain
117 financial information and information concerning the school’s compliance with its
118 empowerment plan; (2) the board of trustees of a school district and the Department to
119 conduct financial audits of empowerment schools; and (3) such reports and audits concerning
120 empowerment schools to be compiled and forwarded to certain entities. (NRS 388G.200)
121 Section 16 of this bill eliminates these requirements.
122 Existing law authorizes the board of trustees of a school district or the governing body of
123 a charter school to offer a work-based learning program upon the approval of the
124 Superintendent of Public Instruction. (NRS 389.167) Section 17 of this bill eliminates the
125 requirement for a school district or charter school offering a work-based learning program to
126 submit a biennial report to the State Board and the Legislature concerning the manner in
127 which the program has been carried out.
128 Existing law requires the Commission on Professional Standards in Education to
129 prescribe by regulation the qualifications for licensing teachers and other educational
Senate Amendment No. 869 to Senate Bill No. 81 First Reprint Page 6
130 personnel. (NRS 391.019) Section 18 of this bill: (1) eliminates the requirement for the
131 Commission to prescribe qualifications for licensing administrators through an alternative
132 route to licensure; and (2) requires the Commission to prescribe qualifications and procedures
133 for licensed teachers and other licensed educational personnel to become licensed as an
134 administrator without restricting the ability of such a person to obtain employment as an
135 administrator.
136 Existing law requires each school district that employs a consultant to submit a report to
137 the Interim Finance Committee at least once every 6 months. (NRS 391.155) Section 19 of
138 this bill reduces the frequency of this report to at least once annually.
139 Existing law: (1) establishes the Teach Nevada Scholarship Program, the Nevada Teacher
140 Advancement Scholarship Program and the Incentivizing Pathways to Teaching Grant
141 Program; and (2) sets forth requirements for the administration of these programs. (NRS
142 391A.550-391A.595, 391A.650-391A.695, 391A.700, 391A.705, 391A.710) Sections 20-31
143 of this bill transfer the administration of these programs from the State Board to the
144 Department. [Section 19. 3] Section 19.5 of this bill requires the Department to create a
145 program of block grants to provide one lump-sum grant to an institution that receives a grant
146 from each of these programs. Section 21 expands the eligibility for Teach Nevada
147 Scholarships to include Nevada residents who graduated from high school in another state or
148 who, before the age of 20, successfully completed the high school equivalency assessment
149 selected by the State Board in another state. Section 26 additionally expands the programs for
150 which a student is eligible to receive a Nevada Teacher Advancement Scholarship to include
151 programs which: (1) result in a certificate of advanced study or other degree which is more
152 advanced than a bachelor’s degree, in education or a related field of study; or (2) upon
153 completion, make a student eligible to obtain a license and endorsement to teach in a subject
154 area for which there is a shortage of teachers. [Sections 22 and 27 eliminate the requirement
155 that the recipient of a Teach Nevada Scholarship or Nevada Teacher Advancement
156 Scholarship meet certain requirements to receive the remaining 25 percent of the scholarship
157 that has not been disbursed .] Section 27 also makes a conforming change relating to the
158 amount which may be awarded under the Nevada Teacher Advancement Scholarship Program
159 to reflect the additional programs for which a Nevada Teacher Advancement Scholarship may
160 be awarded as provided in section 26. [Section 19.7 of this bill creates the Incentivizing
161 Pathways to Teaching Grant Program Account.]
162 Sections 20.5, 21.5, 22 and 24.5 of this bill become effective on July 1, 2027. Section
163 20.5: (1) changes the name of the Teach Nevada Scholarship Program Account to the
164 Teach Nevada Recruitment, Preparation and Retention Program Account; and (2)
165 eliminates the requirement that money in the Account may only be used to award grants
166 to entities to award scholarships pursuant to section 22. Section 21.5 expands the
167 programs whose students are eligible to receive a scholarship from an institution that
168 receives a grant from the Account. Section 22 eliminates the requirement that the
169 recipient of a scholarship provided by an institution which receives a grant from the
170 Account meet certain requirements to receive the remaining 25 percent of the
171 scholarship that has not been disbursed. Section 22 additionally: (1) expands the group
172 of students who may receive such a scholarship; (2) changes the method for determining
173 the maximum amount of a scholarship a student may receive; and (3) requires
174 institutions that receive grants to provide such scholarships to enter an agreement to
175 share data with the Department. Sections 21.5, 22 and 24.5 make conforming changes to
176 reflect the change in the name of the Account.
177 Section 35 of this bill repeals provisions requiring the Department to: (1) recommend that
178 a minimum amount of money be spent during each fiscal year of the biennium on textbooks,
179 instructional supplies, instructional software and instructional hardware by all school districts,
180 charter schools and university schools for profoundly gifted pupils; and (2) publish a report on
181 school districts, charter schools and university schools for profoundly gifted pupils which did
182 not spend the recommended minimum amount. Section 35 also repeals provisions requiring
183 the board of trustees of each school district to submit an annual report concerning professional
184 development training offered by the school district.
185 Section 35.5 of this bill repeals provisions governing the Nevada Teacher
186 Advancement Scholarship Program and the Incentivizing Pathways to Teaching Grant
187 Program, including, without limitation, sections 25-31, on July 1, 2027. Section 35.7 of
188 this bill requires any money that is in the budget account for the Incentivizing Pathways
Senate Amendment No. 869 to Senate Bill No. 81 First Reprint Page 7
189 to Teaching Grant Program Account and the Nevada Teacher Advancement Scholarship
190 Program Account on June 30, 2027, to be transferred to the Teach Nevada Scholarship
191 Program Account.

27 Sec. 3. (Deleted by amendment.)
28 Sec. 4. NRS 387.1213 is hereby amended to read as follows:
29 387.1213 1. The Education Stabilization Account is hereby created in the
30 State Education Fund. Except as otherwise provided in this section, each year after
31 the close of the previous fiscal year and before the [issuance of the State
32 Controller’s annual report,] close of the then current fiscal year, each county
33 school district shall transfer from the county school district fund to the Education
34 Stabilization Account any amount by which the actual ending fund balance of the
35 county school district fund exceeds 16.6 percent of the total actual expenditures for
36 the fund. The interest and income earned on the money in the Account, after
37 deducting any applicable charges, must be credited to the Account.
38 2. Money transferred pursuant to subsection 1 to the Education Stabilization
39 Account is a continuing appropriation solely for the purpose of authorizing the
40 expenditure of the transferred money for the purposes set forth in this section.
41 3. The balance in the Education Stabilization Account must not exceed 20
42 percent of the total of all appropriations and authorizations from the State
43 Education Fund, excluding the Education Stabilization Account, for the
44 immediately preceding fiscal year. Any money transferred to the Education
45 Stabilization Account which exceeds this amount must instead be transferred to the
46 State Education Fund.
47 4. If the Interim Finance Committee finds that:
48 (a) Upon submission of a request from the Department, the actual enrollment
49 growth for a fiscal year exceeds the projected enrollment growth by an amount that
50 the Interim Finance Committee determines would make a transfer of money to the
51 State Education Fund necessary to fund the excess enrollment;
Senate Amendment No. 869 to Senate Bill No. 81 First Reprint Page 9
1 (b) The collection of revenue in any fiscal year will result in the State
2 Education Fund receiving less money than authorized for expenditure from the
3 State Education Fund;
4 (c) Upon submission of a request from the Department, any amount of money
5 which was deposited in the State Education Fund is found by an audit to have been
6 deposited in error; or
7 (d) Upon submission of a request from the Department, any error in the

9 shortfall in the State Education Fund,
10  the Committee shall by resolution establish an amount of money to transfer from
11 the Education Stabilization Account to the State Education Fund and direct the
12 State Controller to transfer that amount to the State Education Fund. The State
13 Controller shall thereupon make the transfer.
14 5. When determining the actual ending fund balance for the purposes of
15 subsection 1, each county school district shall exclude:
16 (a) Any money deposited in the county school district fund on or before June
17 30, 2020;
18 (b) Any money apportioned to the county school district for capital projects or
19 debt service pursuant to subsection 2 of NRS 362.170 and deposited in the county
20 school district fund when authorized by law; and
21 (c) Any money transferred to the county school district and authorized for
22 expenditure as a continuing appropriation pursuant to paragraph (b) of subsection 6
23 of NRS 387.1214.
24 6. If the Superintendent of Public Instruction determines that the money due
25 from the State Education Fund to a county school district, charter school or
26 university school for profoundly gifted pupils pursuant to NRS 387.185 exceeds the
27 amount of money available in the State Education Fund because of a delay in
28 expected receipts, he or she may request from the Director of the Office of Finance
29 a temporary advance from the Education Stabilization Account for the payment of
30 such money due. Upon receipt of such a request, the Director of the Office of
31 Finance shall make a recommendation to the Interim Finance Committee to
32 approve the temporary advance in whole or in part or to deny the request. If the
33 Interim Finance Committee approves the request in whole or in part, the Director of
34 the Office of Finance shall notify the State Controller and the Fiscal Analysis
35 Division of the Legislative Counsel Bureau of the amount approved by the Interim
36 Finance Committee, and the State Controller shall draw his or her warrant upon
37 receipt of such a notice of approval. Any money which is temporarily advanced
38 from the Education Stabilization Account pursuant to this subsection must be
39 repaid by August 31 following the end of the fiscal year in which the temporary
40 advance is made.
41 7. The balance remaining in the State Education Fund, excluding the balance
42 remaining in the Education Stabilization Account, that has not been committed for
43 expenditure on or before June 30 of an odd-numbered fiscal year must be
44 transferred to the Education Stabilization Account to the extent that such a transfer
45 would not cause the balance in the Education Stabilization Account to exceed the
46 limit established in subsection 3.
47 Sec. 4.5. NRS 387.1223 is hereby amended to read as follows:
48 387.1223 1. On or before October 1, January 1, April 1 and July 1, each
49 school district, charter school and university school for profoundly gifted pupils
50 shall report to the Department, in the form prescribed by the Department, the

2 on the next business day.
3 2. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3, the yearly apportionment
4 from the State Education Fund for each school district, charter school and
5 university school for profoundly gifted pupils must be computed by:
6 (a) Multiplying the adjusted base per pupil funding established for that school
7 district, charter school or university school for profoundly gifted pupils for that
8 school year by the sum of:

instructional supplies, instructional software and instructional hardware.
[1. On or before August 1 of each odd-numbered year, the Department, in
consultation with the Budget Division of the Office of Finance and the Fiscal
Analysis Division of the Legislative Counsel Bureau, shall determine a
recommended minimum amount of money to be expended during each fiscal year
of a biennium for textbooks, instructional supplies, instructional software and
instructional hardware by all school districts, charter schools and university schools
for profoundly gifted pupils. The amount must be determined by increasing the
amount that was established for the Fiscal Year 2004-2005 by the percentage of the
change in enrollment between Fiscal Year 2004-2005 and the fiscal year for which
the amount is being established, plus any inflationary adjustment approved by the
Legislature after Fiscal Year 2004-2005.

Section 3:
2. The Department, in consultation with the Budget Division of the Office of
Finance and the Fiscal Analysis Division of the Legislative Counsel Bureau, shall
develop or revise, as applicable, a formula for determining the minimum amount of
money that each school district, charter school and university school for profoundly
gifted pupils is recommended to expend each fiscal year for textbooks, instructional
supplies, instructional software and instructional hardware. The sum of all of the
minimum amounts determined pursuant to this subsection must be equal to the
combined minimum amount determined pursuant to subsection 1. The formula
must be used only to develop expenditure recommendations and must not be used
to alter the yearly apportionment from the State Education Fund to school districts,
charter schools or university schools for profoundly gifted pupils.

Section 4:
3. Upon approval of the formula pursuant to subsection 2, the Department
shall provide written notice to each school district, charter school and university
school for profoundly gifted pupils on or before August 15 of each odd-numbered
year that sets forth the recommended minimum combined amount of money that the
school district, charter school and university school for profoundly gifted pupils

that a school district, charter school or university school for profoundly gifted
pupils, as applicable, has not expended the recommended minimum amount of
money set forth in the notice or the revised notice, as applicable, provided pursuant
to subsection 3 of NRS 387.206, the Department shall publish a report on an
Internet website maintained by the Department which identifies the difference
between the actual combined expenditure for textbooks, instructional supplies,
instructional software and instructional hardware and the minimum recommended
combined expenditure set forth in the notice provided pursuant to subsection 3 of
NRS 387.206.

Section 7:
3. If the actual enrollment of pupils in a school district, charter school or
university school for profoundly gifted pupils is less than the enrollment included in
the projections used in the biennial budget of the school district submitted pursuant
to NRS 387.303, the budget of the charter school submitted pursuant to NRS
388A.345 or the report of the university school for profoundly gifted pupils
submitted pursuant to NRS 388C.250, as applicable, the recommended expenditure
for textbooks, instructional supplies, instructional software and instructional

and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates the Department of Education, which consists of the State Board of
2 Education and the Superintendent of Public Instruction. (NRS 385.010) Section 1 of this bill
3 requires the Department to create and conduct surveys of: (1) public school employees,
4 assessing school climate and working conditions in schools; and (2) public school employees
5 who are leaving employment at a public school. Section 1 additionally: (1) sets forth when
6 such surveys must be administered; (2) sets forth how a school district must use the results of
7 such surveys; (3) prohibits data collected from such surveys from being used in certain
8 evaluations; (4) requires the Department to recognize schools which achieve a certain
9 response rate on such surveys in the statewide system of accountability; and (5) requires the
10 Department to submit annually to the Commission on School Funding and the State Board a
11 report containing data from the surveys.

Senate Amendment No. 869 to Senate Bill No. 81 First Reprint Page 4
12 Existing law requires the principal of each school, in consultation with the employees of
13 the school, to prepare a plan to improve the achievement of the pupils enrolled in the school.
14 (NRS 385A.650) Section 2 of this bill requires the plan to be informed by the results of
15 surveys conducted pursuant to section 1.
16 Existing law creates the Education Stabilization Account in the State Education Fund and
17 requires each school district, each year after the close of the previous fiscal year and before
18 the issuance of the State Controller’s annual report, to transfer from the county school district
19 fund to the Education Stabilization Account any amount by which the actual ending fund
20 balance of the county school district fund exceeds 16.6 percent of the total actual expenditures
21 for the fund. (NRS 387.1213) Section 4 of this bill requires each school district to make this
22 transfer after the close of the previous fiscal year and before the close of the then current fiscal
23 year.
24 Existing law establishes certain requirements governing the use of information
25 concerning the average daily enrollment of pupils, including, without limitation: (1) requiring
26 each school district to submit a quarterly report to the Department containing the average
27 daily enrollment of pupils; and (2) providing the method for computing the yearly
28 apportionment to the school district from the State Education Fund. (NRS 387.1223) Section
29 4.5 of this bill applies these provisions to charter schools and university schools for
30 profoundly gifted pupils.
31 Under the Pupil-Centered Funding Plan, existing law requires a public school that
32 receives weighted funding for one or more at-risk pupils or pupils who are English learners to
33 use such funding only to provide services to such pupils, which are referred to as “Victory
34 services” and “Zoom services,” respectively. (NRS 387.121, 387.12445) Section 5 of this bill
35 changes the term “Victory services” to “services for at-risk pupils,” and “Zoom services” to
36 “services for pupils who are English learners.”
37 Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district and the governing body
38 of each charter school to submit to the Superintendent of Public Instruction and certain other
39 recipients, on or before November 1 of each year, a report regarding the budget of the school
40 district or charter school. (NRS 387.303, 388A.345) Existing law requires the Superintendent
41 of Public Instruction, on or before November 25 of each year, to submit a compilation of the
42 reports made by each school district and charter school to the Office of Finance in the Office
43 of the Governor and the Fiscal Analysis Division of the Legislative Counsel Bureau. (NRS
44 387.303, 388A.345) Existing law requires the governing body of a university school for
45 profoundly gifted pupils to submit a similar report to the Department of Education on or
46 before November 15 of each year. (NRS 388C.250) Sections 6, 13 and 15 of this bill require
47 these reports to be submitted annually, on or before the Friday of the first week in January that
48 contains 5 business days. Sections 6 and 13 require the compilation of reports to be submitted
49 on or before the last Friday in January.
50 Existing law requires the Governor, on or before January 1 of each year, to compile a
51 report on the status of the finances of the State, including the information published in the
52 most recent annual report regarding the budget of each school district. (NRS 353.333) Section
53 32 of this bill requires that this report be compiled on or before February 15 of each year, to
54 conform with the change made by section 6 to the date by which the compilation of reports
55 regarding the budget of each school district is required to be submitted to the Office of
56 Finance.
57 Existing law requires the clerk of the board of trustees of a county school district to
58 publish a quarterly expenditure report for the school district in a newspaper that meets certain
59 qualifications. (NRS 387.320) Section 7 of this bill requires the expenditure report to instead
60 be published on the Internet website of the county school district.
61 Existing law: (1) provides that the State Board is the sole state agency responsible for the
62 administration of career and technical education; and (2) sets forth actions the State Board is
63 authorized to take in relation to such authority. (NRS 388.360) Section 7.3 of this bill
64 authorizes the State Board to request, rather than direct, the Superintendent of Public
65 Instruction to make studies and investigations relating to career and technical education.
66 Existing law requires the Executive Officer of the State Board to designate a program
67 professional to perform certain duties relating to programs of career and technical education
68 that have received grants of money. (NRS 388.396) Section 7.7 of this bill instead requires the
69 Superintendent of Public Instruction to designate a program professional to perform such
70 duties.

Senate Amendment No. 869 to Senate Bill No. 81 First Reprint Page 5
71 Existing law authorizes the board of trustees of a school district, with the approval of the
72 juvenile court and the board of county commissioners, to employ qualified teachers for the
73 instruction of children detained in facilities for the detention of children, alternative programs
74 and juvenile forestry camps. (NRS 388.550) Existing law requires the board of trustees of a
75 school district providing such instruction to report to the Superintendent of Public Instruction
76 at such times and in such manner as the Superintendent of Public Instruction prescribes. (NRS
77 388.570) Section 8 of this bill eliminates the requirement for the board of trustees of such a
78 school district to provide such reports to the Superintendent of Public Instruction.
79 Existing law prohibits the ratio of pupils per licensed teacher in certain classes from
80 exceeding certain ratios during each school quarter of a school year. (NRS 388.700) Existing
81 law requires the board of trustees of each school district to report to the Department, on a
82 quarterly basis, the average daily enrollment of pupils and the ratio of pupils per licensed
83 teacher for certain grade levels. (NRS 388.725) If the ratio of pupils per licensed teacher at
84 one or more elementary schools in a school district exceeds the ratio prescribed by statute
85 during any quarter of a school year, existing law requires the school district to request a
86 variance from the State Board for each such school for the subsequent quarter. (NRS 388.700)
87 Section 12 of this bill eliminates the requirement to submit quarterly reports regarding the
88 average daily enrollment of pupils and the ratio of pupils per licensed teacher for certain grade
89 levels and requires the board of trustees of each school district to instead report such
90 information to the Department only on a semiannual basis each year for: (1) the period
91 beginning on July 1 and ending on September 30; and (2) the period beginning on January 1
92 and ending on March 31. Section 9 of this bill requires a school district to request a variance
93 for an elementary school which exceeds the maximum ratio of pupils per licensed teacher only
94 if the ratio is exceeded during a reporting period. Section 9 also: (1) reduces the frequency of
95 the reports regarding variances requested by school districts which the State Board is required
96 to submit to the Interim Finance Committee from quarterly to semiannually; and (2)
97 eliminates the requirement for the State Board to submit a report to the Legislature regarding
98 variances and the data collected by school districts on the effectiveness of plans to reduce
99 pupil-teacher ratios.
100 Existing law requires each school district, in cooperation with the recognized associations
101 representing licensed educational personnel, to develop a plan to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio
102 per class in certain grade levels and submit that plan to the State Board. (NRS 388.720)
103 Section 10 of this bill requires this plan to be submitted to the State Board on or before
104 October 1 of each year.
105 Section 11 of this bill eliminates the requirement for the Department to develop policies
106 and procedures for the distribution of money to each school district for the reduction of pupil-
107 teacher ratios.
108 Existing law requires the sponsor of a charter school that has received, within each of the
109 immediately preceding 3 consecutive school years, one of the two lowest ratings of
110 performance pursuant to the statewide system of accountability for public schools to submit a
111 report to the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Education on or before December 15 of
112 each odd-numbered year describing certain actions taken by the sponsor of the charter school.
113 (NRS 388A.355) Section 14 of this bill requires this report to be submitted annually, on or
114 before February 15.
115 Existing law requires: (1) certain charter schools that are approved to operate as
116 empowerment schools to submit a quarterly report to the Department containing certain
117 financial information and information concerning the school’s compliance with its
118 empowerment plan; (2) the board of trustees of a school district and the Department to
119 conduct financial audits of empowerment schools; and (3) such reports and audits concerning
120 empowerment schools to be compiled and forwarded to certain entities. (NRS 388G.200)
121 Section 16 of this bill eliminates these requirements.
122 Existing law authorizes the board of trustees of a school district or the governing body of
123 a charter school to offer a work-based learning program upon the approval of the
124 Superintendent of Public Instruction. (NRS 389.167) Section 17 of this bill eliminates the
125 requirement for a school district or charter school offering a work-based learning program to
126 submit a biennial report to the State Board and the Legislature concerning the manner in
127 which the program has been carried out.
128 Existing law requires the Commission on Professional Standards in Education to
129 prescribe by regulation the qualifications for licensing teachers and other educational

Senate Amendment No. 869 to Senate Bill No. 81 First Reprint Page 6
130 personnel. (NRS 391.019) Section 18 of this bill: (1) eliminates the requirement for the
131 Commission to prescribe qualifications for licensing administrators through an alternative
132 route to licensure; and (2) requires the Commission to prescribe qualifications and procedures
133 for licensed teachers and other licensed educational personnel to become licensed as an
134 administrator without restricting the ability of such a person to obtain employment as an
135 administrator.
136 Existing law requires each school district that employs a consultant to submit a report to
137 the Interim Finance Committee at least once every 6 months. (NRS 391.155) Section 19 of
138 this bill reduces the frequency of this report to at least once annually.
139 Existing law: (1) establishes the Teach Nevada Scholarship Program, the Nevada Teacher
140 Advancement Scholarship Program and the Incentivizing Pathways to Teaching Grant
141 Program; and (2) sets forth requirements for the administration of these programs. (NRS
142 391A.550-391A.595, 391A.650-391A.695, 391A.700, 391A.705, 391A.710) Sections 20-31
143 of this bill transfer the administration of these programs from the State Board to the
144 Department. [Section 19. 3] Section 19.5 of this bill requires the Department to create a
145 program of block grants to provide one lump-sum grant to an institution that receives a grant
146 from each of these programs. Section 21 expands the eligibility for Teach Nevada
147 Scholarships to include Nevada residents who graduated from high school in another state or
148 who, before the age of 20, successfully completed the high school equivalency assessment
149 selected by the State Board in another state. Section 26 additionally expands the programs for
150 which a student is eligible to receive a Nevada Teacher Advancement Scholarship to include
151 programs which: (1) result in a certificate of advanced study or other degree which is more
152 advanced than a bachelor’s degree, in education or a related field of study; or (2) upon
153 completion, make a student eligible to obtain a license and endorsement to teach in a subject
154 area for which there is a shortage of teachers. [Sections 22 and 27 eliminate the requirement
155 that the recipient of a Teach Nevada Scholarship or Nevada Teacher Advancement
156 Scholarship meet certain requirements to receive the remaining 25 percent of the scholarship
157 that has not been disbursed .] Section 27 also makes a conforming change relating to the
158 amount which may be awarded under the Nevada Teacher Advancement Scholarship Program
159 to reflect the additional programs for which a Nevada Teacher Advancement Scholarship may
160 be awarded as provided in section 26. [Section 19.7 of this bill creates the Incentivizing
161 Pathways to Teaching Grant Program Account.]
162 Sections 20.5, 21.5, 22 and 24.5 of this bill become effective on July 1, 2027. Section
163 20.5: (1) changes the name of the Teach Nevada Scholarship Program Account to the
164 Teach Nevada Recruitment, Preparation and Retention Program Account; and (2)
165 eliminates the requirement that money in the Account may only be used to award grants
166 to entities to award scholarships pursuant to section 22. Section 21.5 expands the
167 programs whose students are eligible to receive a scholarship from an institution that
168 receives a grant from the Account. Section 22 eliminates the requirement that the
169 recipient of a scholarship provided by an institution which receives a grant from the
170 Account meet certain requirements to receive the remaining 25 percent of the
171 scholarship that has not been disbursed. Section 22 additionally: (1) expands the group
172 of students who may receive such a scholarship; (2) changes the method for determining
173 the maximum amount of a scholarship a student may receive; and (3) requires
174 institutions that receive grants to provide such scholarships to enter an agreement to
175 share data with the Department. Sections 21.5, 22 and 24.5 make conforming changes to
176 reflect the change in the name of the Account.
177 Section 35 of this bill repeals provisions requiring the Department to: (1) recommend that
178 a minimum amount of money be spent during each fiscal year of the biennium on textbooks,
179 instructional supplies, instructional software and instructional hardware by all school districts,
180 charter schools and university schools for profoundly gifted pupils; and (2) publish a report on
181 school districts, charter schools and university schools for profoundly gifted pupils which did
182 not spend the recommended minimum amount. Section 35 also repeals provisions requiring
183 the board of trustees of each school district to submit an annual report concerning professional
184 development training offered by the school district.
185 Section 35.5 of this bill repeals provisions governing the Nevada Teacher
186 Advancement Scholarship Program and the Incentivizing Pathways to Teaching Grant
187 Program, including, without limitation, sections 25-31, on July 1, 2027. Section 35.7 of
188 this bill requires any money that is in the budget account for the Incentivizing Pathways

Senate Amendment No. 869 to Senate Bill No. 81 First Reprint Page 7
189 to Teaching Grant Program Account and the Nevada Teacher Advancement Scholarship
190 Program Account on June 30, 2027, to be transferred to the Teach Nevada Scholarship
191 Program Account.

33 school district shall transfer from the county school district fund to the Education
34 Stabilization Account any amount by which the actual ending fund balance of the
35 county school district fund exceeds 16.6 percent of the total actual expenditures for
36 the fund. The interest and income earned on the money in the Account, after
37 deducting any applicable charges, must be credited to the Account.
38 2. Money transferred pursuant to subsection 1 to the Education Stabilization
39 Account is a continuing appropriation solely for the purpose of authorizing the
40 expenditure of the transferred money for the purposes set forth in this section.

47 4. If the Interim Finance Committee finds that:
48 (a) Upon submission of a request from the Department, the actual enrollment
49 growth for a fiscal year exceeds the projected enrollment growth by an amount that
50 the Interim Finance Committee determines would make a transfer of money to the

Senate Amendment No. 869 to Senate Bill No. 81 First Reprint Page 9
1 (b) The collection of revenue in any fiscal year will result in the State
2 Education Fund receiving less money than authorized for expenditure from the
3 State Education Fund;

11 the Education Stabilization Account to the State Education Fund and direct the
12 State Controller to transfer that amount to the State Education Fund. The State
13 Controller shall thereupon make the transfer.
14 5. When determining the actual ending fund balance for the purposes of
15 subsection 1, each county school district shall exclude:
16 (a) Any money deposited in the county school district fund on or before June
17 30, 2020;

51 a school district or a charter school that is located within the school district based
52 on the average daily enrollment of pupils during the quarter of the school year is

29 Sec. 5. NRS 387.12445 is hereby amended to read as follows:
30 387.12445 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2, each school

32 district pursuant to paragraph (c) of subsection 2 of NRS 387.1214 is accounted for
33 separately and, after a deduction for the administrative expenses of the school
34 district in an amount which does not exceed the amount prescribed by the
35 Department by regulation for each school district, be distributed and used as
36 described in this subsection. The adjusted base per pupil funding provided to each

38 (a) Be distributed by each school district to its public schools in a manner that
39 ensures each pupil in the school district receives a reasonably equal educational
40 opportunity.

46 (b) or (e) of subsection 2 of NRS 387.1214 or NRS 387.122.
47 2. If a school district determines that an additional amount of money is

50 district, the school district may transfer the necessary amount of money from the
51 adjusted base per pupil funding received by the school district for that purpose.
52 3. Each school district shall ensure that all weighted funding received by the
53 school district pursuant to paragraph (e) of subsection 2 of NRS 387.1214 is

Senate Amendment No. 869 to Senate Bill No. 81 First Reprint Page 12
1 accounted for separately and distributed directly to each school in which the

3 4. Each public school shall account separately for the local funding for pupils
4 with disabilities received by the public school pursuant to paragraph (b) of
5 subsection 2 of NRS 387.1214, for the adjusted base per pupil funding received by

8 paragraph (e) of subsection 2 of NRS 387.1214 and for money received from the
9 statewide multiplier pursuant to NRS 387.122. Unless the provisions of subsection
10 7 or 8 impose greater restrictions on the use of weighted funding by a public school,
11 the public school must use the weighted funding received for each relevant pupil:
12 (a) As a supplement to the adjusted base per pupil funding received for the

30 (5) The supplies and equipment needed for providing special education.
31 6. Money received from federal sources must be accounted for separately and
32 excluded from the accounting required pursuant to subsection 5.
33 7. A public school that receives weighted funding for one or more at-risk

387.206 Recommended minimum expenditure by school districts, charter
schools and university schools for profoundly gifted pupils for textbooks,
instructional supplies, instructional software and instructional hardware.
[1. On or before August 1 of each odd-numbered year, the Department, in
consultation with the Budget Division of the Office of Finance and the Fiscal
Analysis Division of the Legislative Counsel Bureau, shall determine a
recommended minimum amount of money to be expended during each fiscal year
of a biennium for textbooks, instructional supplies, instructional software and
instructional hardware by all school districts, charter schools and university schools
for profoundly gifted pupils. The amount must be determined by increasing the
amount that was established for the Fiscal Year 2004-2005 by the percentage of the
change in enrollment between Fiscal Year 2004-2005 and the fiscal year for which
the amount is being established, plus any inflationary adjustment approved by the
Legislature after Fiscal Year 2004-2005.
2. The Department, in consultation with the Budget Division of the Office of
Finance and the Fiscal Analysis Division of the Legislative Counsel Bureau, shall
develop or revise, as applicable, a formula for determining the minimum amount of
money that each school district, charter school and university school for profoundly
gifted pupils is recommended to expend each fiscal year for textbooks, instructional
supplies, instructional software and instructional hardware. The sum of all of the
minimum amounts determined pursuant to this subsection must be equal to the
combined minimum amount determined pursuant to subsection 1. The formula
must be used only to develop expenditure recommendations and must not be used
to alter the yearly apportionment from the State Education Fund to school districts,
charter schools or university schools for profoundly gifted pupils.
3. Upon approval of the formula pursuant to subsection 2, the Department
shall provide written notice to each school district, charter school and university
school for profoundly gifted pupils on or before August 15 of each odd-numbered
year that sets forth the recommended minimum combined amount of money that the
school district, charter school and university school for profoundly gifted pupils

Senate Amendment No. 869 to Senate Bill No. 81 First Reprint Page 39
may expend for textbooks, instructional supplies, instructional software and
instructional hardware for each fiscal year of a biennium.]
387.2062 Report concerning failure to comply with recommended
minimum expenditure.
[1. On or before January 1 of each year, the Department shall determine
whether each school district, charter school and university school for profoundly
gifted pupils has expended, during the immediately preceding fiscal year, the
recommended minimum amount of money set forth in the notice provided pursuant
to subsection 3 of NRS 387.206. In making this determination, the Department
shall use the report submitted by:
(a) The school district pursuant to NRS 387.303.
(b) The charter school pursuant to NRS 388A.345.
(c) The university school for profoundly gifted pupils pursuant to NRS
388C.250.
2. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3, if the Department determines
that a school district, charter school or university school for profoundly gifted
pupils, as applicable, has not expended the recommended minimum amount of
money set forth in the notice or the revised notice, as applicable, provided pursuant
to subsection 3 of NRS 387.206, the Department shall publish a report on an
Internet website maintained by the Department which identifies the difference
between the actual combined expenditure for textbooks, instructional supplies,
instructional software and instructional hardware and the minimum recommended
combined expenditure set forth in the notice provided pursuant to subsection 3 of
NRS 387.206.
3. If the actual enrollment of pupils in a school district, charter school or
university school for profoundly gifted pupils is less than the enrollment included in
the projections used in the biennial budget of the school district submitted pursuant
to NRS 387.303, the budget of the charter school submitted pursuant to NRS
388A.345 or the report of the university school for profoundly gifted pupils
submitted pursuant to NRS 388C.250, as applicable, the recommended expenditure
for textbooks, instructional supplies, instructional software and instructional
hardware pursuant to NRS 387.206 must be reduced proportionately.]
391A.205 Submission of annual report concerning professional
development training by board of trustees.
[ 1. On or before December 1 of each year, the board of trustees of each school
district shall submit, on a form prescribed by the Department, an annual report
concerning the professional development training offered by the school district to
the State Board, the Commission on Professional Standards in Education, the Joint
