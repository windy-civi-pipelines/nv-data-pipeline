Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates the Department of Education, which consists of the State
2 Board of Education and the Superintendent of Public Instruction. (NRS 385.010)

4 public school employees, assessing school climate and working conditions in
5 schools; and (2) public school employees who are leaving employment at a public
-

6 school. Section 1 additionally: (1) sets forth when such surveys must be
7 administered; (2) sets forth how a school district must use the results of such
8 surveys; (3) prohibits data collected from such surveys from being used in certain
9 evaluations; (4) requires the Department to recognize schools which achieve a
10 certain response rate on such surveys in the statewide system of accountability; and
11 (5) requires the Department to submit annually to the Commission on School
12 Funding and the State Board a report containing data from the surveys.
13 Existing law requires the principal of each school, in consultation with the
14 employees of the school, to prepare a plan to improve the achievement of the pupils
15 enrolled in the school. (NRS 385A.650) Section 2 of this bill requires the plan to be
16 informed by the results of surveys conducted pursuant to section 1.
17 Existing law creates the Education Stabilization Account in the State Education
18 Fund and requires each school district, each year after the close of the previous
19 fiscal year and before the issuance of the State Controller’s annual report, to
20 transfer from the county school district fund to the Education Stabilization Account
21 any amount by which the actual ending fund balance of the county school district
22 fund exceeds 16.6 percent of the total actual expenditures for the fund. (NRS
23 387.1213) Section 4 of this bill requires each school district to make this transfer
24 after the close of the previous fiscal year and before the close of the then current
25 fiscal year.
26 Existing law establishes certain requirements governing the use of information
27 concerning the average daily enrollment of pupils, including, without limitation: (1)
28 requiring each school district to submit a quarterly report to the Department
29 containing the average daily enrollment of pupils; and (2) providing the method for
30 computing the yearly apportionment to the school district from the State Education
31 Fund. (NRS 387.1223) Section 4.5 of this bill applies these provisions to charter
32 schools and university schools for profoundly gifted pupils.
33 Under the Pupil-Centered Funding Plan, existing law requires a public school
34 that receives weighted funding for one or more at-risk pupils or pupils who are
35 English learners to use such funding only to provide services to such pupils, which
36 are referred to as “Victory services” and “Zoom services,” respectively. (NRS
37 387.121, 387.12445) Section 5 of this bill changes the term “Victory services” to
38 “services for at-risk pupils,” and “Zoom services” to “services for pupils who are
39 English learners.”
40 Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district and the
41 governing body of each charter school to submit to the Superintendent of Public
42 Instruction and certain other recipients, on or before November 1 of each year, a
43 report regarding the budget of the school district or charter school. (NRS 387.303,
44 388A.345) Existing law requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction, on or
45 before November 25 of each year, to submit a compilation of the reports made by
46 each school district and charter school to the Office of Finance in the Office of the
47 Governor and the Fiscal Analysis Division of the Legislative Counsel Bureau.
48 (NRS 387.303, 388A.345) Existing law requires the governing body of a university
49 school for profoundly gifted pupils to submit a similar report to the Department of
50 Education on or before November 15 of each year. (NRS 388C.250) Sections 6, 13
51 and 15 of this bill require these reports to be submitted annually, on or before the
52 Friday of the first week in January that contains 5 business days. Sections 6 and 13
53 require the compilation of reports to be submitted on or before the last Friday in
54 January.
55 Existing law requires the Governor, on or before January 1 of each year, to
56 compile a report on the status of the finances of the State, including the information
57 published in the most recent annual report regarding the budget of each school
58 district. (NRS 353.333) Section 32 of this bill requires that this report be compiled
59 on or before February 15 of each year, to conform with the change made by
-
*SB81_R1*
– 3 –
60 section 6 to the date by which the compilation of reports regarding the budget of
61 each school district is required to be submitted to the Office of Finance.
62 Existing law requires the clerk of the board of trustees of a county school
63 district to publish a quarterly expenditure report for the school district in a
64 newspaper that meets certain qualifications. (NRS 387.320) Section 7 of this bill
65 requires the expenditure report to instead be published on the Internet website of
66 the county school district.
67 Existing law: (1) provides that the State Board is the sole state agency
68 responsible for the administration of career and technical education; and (2) sets
69 forth actions the State Board is authorized to take in relation to such authority.
70 (NRS 388.360) Section 7.3 of this bill authorizes the State Board to request, rather
71 than direct, the Superintendent of Public Instruction to make studies and
72 investigations relating to career and technical education.
73 Existing law requires the Executive Officer of the State Board to designate a
74 program professional to perform certain duties relating to programs of career and
75 technical education that have received grants of money. (NRS 388.396) Section 7.7
76 of this bill instead requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction to designate a
77 program professional to perform such duties.
78 Existing law authorizes the board of trustees of a school district, with the
79 approval of the juvenile court and the board of county commissioners, to employ
80 qualified teachers for the instruction of children detained in facilities for the
81 detention of children, alternative programs and juvenile forestry camps. (NRS
82 388.550) Existing law requires the board of trustees of a school district providing
83 such instruction to report to the Superintendent of Public Instruction at such times
84 and in such manner as the Superintendent of Public Instruction prescribes. (NRS
85 388.570) Section 8 of this bill eliminates the requirement for the board of trustees
86 of such a school district to provide such reports to the Superintendent of Public
87 Instruction.
88 Existing law prohibits the ratio of pupils per licensed teacher in certain classes
89 from exceeding certain ratios during each school quarter of a school year. (NRS
90 388.700) Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district to report
91 to the Department, on a quarterly basis, the average daily enrollment of pupils and
92 the ratio of pupils per licensed teacher for certain grade levels. (NRS 388.725) If
93 the ratio of pupils per licensed teacher at one or more elementary schools in a
94 school district exceeds the ratio prescribed by statute during any quarter of a school
95 year, existing law requires the school district to request a variance from the State
96 Board for each such school for the subsequent quarter. (NRS 388.700) Section 12
97 of this bill eliminates the requirement to submit quarterly reports regarding the
98 average daily enrollment of pupils and the ratio of pupils per licensed teacher for
99 certain grade levels and requires the board of trustees of each school district to
100 instead report such information to the Department only on a semiannual basis each
101 year for: (1) the period beginning on July 1 and ending on September 30; and (2)
102 the period beginning on January 1 and ending on March 31. Section 9 of this bill
103 requires a school district to request a variance for an elementary school which
104 exceeds the maximum ratio of pupils per licensed teacher only if the ratio is
105 exceeded during a reporting period. Section 9 also: (1) reduces the frequency of the
106 reports regarding variances requested by school districts which the State Board is
107 required to submit to the Interim Finance Committee from quarterly to
108 semiannually; and (2) eliminates the requirement for the State Board to submit a
109 report to the Legislature regarding variances and the data collected by school
110 districts on the effectiveness of plans to reduce pupil-teacher ratios.
111 Existing law requires each school district, in cooperation with the recognized
112 associations representing licensed educational personnel, to develop a plan to
113 reduce the pupil-teacher ratio per class in certain grade levels and submit that plan
-
*SB81_R1*
– 4 –
114 to the State Board. (NRS 388.720) Section 10 of this bill requires this plan to be
115 submitted to the State Board on or before October 1 of each year.
116 Section 11 of this bill eliminates the requirement for the Department to develop
117 policies and procedures for the distribution of money to each school district for the
118 reduction of pupil-teacher ratios.
119 Existing law requires the sponsor of a charter school that has received, within
120 each of the immediately preceding 3 consecutive school years, one of the two
121 lowest ratings of performance pursuant to the statewide system of accountability for
122 public schools to submit a report to the Joint Interim Standing Committee on
123 Education on or before December 15 of each odd-numbered year describing certain
124 actions taken by the sponsor of the charter school. (NRS 388A.355) Section 14 of
125 this bill requires this report to be submitted annually, on or before February 15.
126 Existing law requires: (1) certain charter schools that are approved to operate as
127 empowerment schools to submit a quarterly report to the Department containing
128 certain financial information and information concerning the school’s compliance
129 with its empowerment plan; (2) the board of trustees of a school district and the
130 Department to conduct financial audits of empowerment schools; and (3) such
131 reports and audits concerning empowerment schools to be compiled and forwarded
132 to certain entities. (NRS 388G.200) Section 16 of this bill eliminates these
133 requirements.
134 Existing law authorizes the board of trustees of a school district or the
135 governing body of a charter school to offer a work-based learning program upon
136 the approval of the Superintendent of Public Instruction. (NRS 389.167) Section 17
137 of this bill eliminates the requirement for a school district or charter school offering
138 a work-based learning program to submit a biennial report to the State Board and
139 the Legislature concerning the manner in which the program has been carried out.
140 Existing law requires the Commission on Professional Standards in Education
141 to prescribe by regulation the qualifications for licensing teachers and other
142 educational personnel. (NRS 391.019) Section 18 of this bill: (1) eliminates the
143 requirement for the Commission to prescribe qualifications for licensing
144 administrators through an alternative route to licensure; and (2) requires the
145 Commission to prescribe qualifications and procedures for licensed teachers and
146 other licensed educational personnel to become licensed as an administrator
147 without restricting the ability of such a person to obtain employment as an
148 administrator.
149 Existing law requires each school district that employs a consultant to submit a
150 report to the Interim Finance Committee at least once every 6 months. (NRS
151 391.155) Section 19 of this bill reduces the frequency of this report to at least once
152 annually.
153 Existing law: (1) establishes the Teach Nevada Scholarship Program, the
154 Nevada Teacher Advancement Scholarship Program and the Incentivizing
155 Pathways to Teaching Grant Program; and (2) sets forth requirements for the
156 administration of these programs. (NRS 391A.550-391A.595, 391A.650-391A.695,
157 391A.700, 391A.705, 391A.710) Sections 20-31 of this bill transfer the
158 administration of these programs from the State Board to the Department. Section
159 19.3 of this bill requires the Department to create a program of block grants to
160 provide one lump-sum grant to an institution that receives a grant from each of
161 these programs. Section 21 expands the eligibility for Teach Nevada Scholarships
162 to include Nevada residents who graduated from high school in another state or
163 who, before the age of 20, successfully completed the high school equivalency
164 assessment selected by the State Board in another state. Section 26 additionally
165 expands the programs for which a student is eligible to receive a Nevada Teacher
166 Advancement Scholarship to include programs which: (1) result in a certificate of
167 advanced study or other degree which is more advanced than a bachelor’s degree,
168 in education or a related field of study; or (2) upon completion, make a student
-
*SB81_R1*
– 5 –
169 eligible to obtain a license and endorsement to teach in a subject area for which
170 there is a shortage of teachers. Sections 22 and 27 eliminate the requirement that
171 the recipient of a Teach Nevada Scholarship or Nevada Teacher Advancement
172 Scholarship meet certain requirements to receive the remaining 25 percent of the
173 scholarship that has not been disbursed. Section 27 also makes a conforming
174 change relating to the amount which may be awarded under the Nevada Teacher
175 Advancement Scholarship Program to reflect the additional programs for which a
176 Nevada Teacher Advancement Scholarship may be awarded as provided in section
177 26. Section 19.7 of this bill creates the Incentivizing Pathways to Teaching Grant
178 Program Account.
179 Section 35 of this bill repeals provisions requiring the Department to: (1)
180 recommend that a minimum amount of money be spent during each fiscal year of
181 the biennium on textbooks, instructional supplies, instructional software and
182 instructional hardware by all school districts, charter schools and university schools
183 for profoundly gifted pupils; and (2) publish a report on school districts, charter
184 schools and university schools for profoundly gifted pupils which did not spend the
185 recommended minimum amount. Section 35 also repeals provisions requiring the
186 board of trustees of each school district to submit an annual report concerning
187 professional development training offered by the school district.

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates the Department of Education, which consists of the State
2 Board of Education and the Superintendent of Public Instruction. (NRS 385.010)
3 Section 1 of this bill requires the Department to create and conduct surveys of: (1)
4 public school employees, assessing school climate and working conditions in
5 schools; and (2) public school employees who are leaving employment at a public
-
*SB81_R1*

– 2 –
6 school. Section 1 additionally: (1) sets forth when such surveys must be
7 administered; (2) sets forth how a school district must use the results of such
8 surveys; (3) prohibits data collected from such surveys from being used in certain
9 evaluations; (4) requires the Department to recognize schools which achieve a
10 certain response rate on such surveys in the statewide system of accountability; and
11 (5) requires the Department to submit annually to the Commission on School
12 Funding and the State Board a report containing data from the surveys.
13 Existing law requires the principal of each school, in consultation with the
14 employees of the school, to prepare a plan to improve the achievement of the pupils
15 enrolled in the school. (NRS 385A.650) Section 2 of this bill requires the plan to be
16 informed by the results of surveys conducted pursuant to section 1.
17 Existing law creates the Education Stabilization Account in the State Education
18 Fund and requires each school district, each year after the close of the previous
19 fiscal year and before the issuance of the State Controller’s annual report, to
20 transfer from the county school district fund to the Education Stabilization Account
21 any amount by which the actual ending fund balance of the county school district
22 fund exceeds 16.6 percent of the total actual expenditures for the fund. (NRS
23 387.1213) Section 4 of this bill requires each school district to make this transfer
24 after the close of the previous fiscal year and before the close of the then current
25 fiscal year.
26 Existing law establishes certain requirements governing the use of information
27 concerning the average daily enrollment of pupils, including, without limitation: (1)
28 requiring each school district to submit a quarterly report to the Department
29 containing the average daily enrollment of pupils; and (2) providing the method for
30 computing the yearly apportionment to the school district from the State Education
31 Fund. (NRS 387.1223) Section 4.5 of this bill applies these provisions to charter
32 schools and university schools for profoundly gifted pupils.
33 Under the Pupil-Centered Funding Plan, existing law requires a public school
34 that receives weighted funding for one or more at-risk pupils or pupils who are
35 English learners to use such funding only to provide services to such pupils, which
36 are referred to as “Victory services” and “Zoom services,” respectively. (NRS
37 387.121, 387.12445) Section 5 of this bill changes the term “Victory services” to
38 “services for at-risk pupils,” and “Zoom services” to “services for pupils who are
39 English learners.”
40 Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district and the
41 governing body of each charter school to submit to the Superintendent of Public
42 Instruction and certain other recipients, on or before November 1 of each year, a
43 report regarding the budget of the school district or charter school. (NRS 387.303,
44 388A.345) Existing law requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction, on or
45 before November 25 of each year, to submit a compilation of the reports made by
46 each school district and charter school to the Office of Finance in the Office of the
47 Governor and the Fiscal Analysis Division of the Legislative Counsel Bureau.
48 (NRS 387.303, 388A.345) Existing law requires the governing body of a university
49 school for profoundly gifted pupils to submit a similar report to the Department of
50 Education on or before November 15 of each year. (NRS 388C.250) Sections 6, 13
51 and 15 of this bill require these reports to be submitted annually, on or before the
52 Friday of the first week in January that contains 5 business days. Sections 6 and 13
53 require the compilation of reports to be submitted on or before the last Friday in
54 January.
55 Existing law requires the Governor, on or before January 1 of each year, to
56 compile a report on the status of the finances of the State, including the information
57 published in the most recent annual report regarding the budget of each school
58 district. (NRS 353.333) Section 32 of this bill requires that this report be compiled
59 on or before February 15 of each year, to conform with the change made by
-
*SB81_R1*

– 3 –
60 section 6 to the date by which the compilation of reports regarding the budget of
61 each school district is required to be submitted to the Office of Finance.
62 Existing law requires the clerk of the board of trustees of a county school
63 district to publish a quarterly expenditure report for the school district in a
64 newspaper that meets certain qualifications. (NRS 387.320) Section 7 of this bill
65 requires the expenditure report to instead be published on the Internet website of
66 the county school district.
67 Existing law: (1) provides that the State Board is the sole state agency
68 responsible for the administration of career and technical education; and (2) sets
69 forth actions the State Board is authorized to take in relation to such authority.
70 (NRS 388.360) Section 7.3 of this bill authorizes the State Board to request, rather
71 than direct, the Superintendent of Public Instruction to make studies and
72 investigations relating to career and technical education.
73 Existing law requires the Executive Officer of the State Board to designate a
74 program professional to perform certain duties relating to programs of career and
75 technical education that have received grants of money. (NRS 388.396) Section 7.7
76 of this bill instead requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction to designate a
77 program professional to perform such duties.
78 Existing law authorizes the board of trustees of a school district, with the
79 approval of the juvenile court and the board of county commissioners, to employ
80 qualified teachers for the instruction of children detained in facilities for the
81 detention of children, alternative programs and juvenile forestry camps. (NRS
82 388.550) Existing law requires the board of trustees of a school district providing
83 such instruction to report to the Superintendent of Public Instruction at such times
84 and in such manner as the Superintendent of Public Instruction prescribes. (NRS
85 388.570) Section 8 of this bill eliminates the requirement for the board of trustees
86 of such a school district to provide such reports to the Superintendent of Public
87 Instruction.
88 Existing law prohibits the ratio of pupils per licensed teacher in certain classes
89 from exceeding certain ratios during each school quarter of a school year. (NRS
90 388.700) Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district to report
91 to the Department, on a quarterly basis, the average daily enrollment of pupils and
92 the ratio of pupils per licensed teacher for certain grade levels. (NRS 388.725) If
93 the ratio of pupils per licensed teacher at one or more elementary schools in a
94 school district exceeds the ratio prescribed by statute during any quarter of a school
95 year, existing law requires the school district to request a variance from the State
96 Board for each such school for the subsequent quarter. (NRS 388.700) Section 12
97 of this bill eliminates the requirement to submit quarterly reports regarding the
98 average daily enrollment of pupils and the ratio of pupils per licensed teacher for
99 certain grade levels and requires the board of trustees of each school district to
100 instead report such information to the Department only on a semiannual basis each
101 year for: (1) the period beginning on July 1 and ending on September 30; and (2)
102 the period beginning on January 1 and ending on March 31. Section 9 of this bill
103 requires a school district to request a variance for an elementary school which
104 exceeds the maximum ratio of pupils per licensed teacher only if the ratio is
105 exceeded during a reporting period. Section 9 also: (1) reduces the frequency of the
106 reports regarding variances requested by school districts which the State Board is
107 required to submit to the Interim Finance Committee from quarterly to
108 semiannually; and (2) eliminates the requirement for the State Board to submit a
109 report to the Legislature regarding variances and the data collected by school
110 districts on the effectiveness of plans to reduce pupil-teacher ratios.
111 Existing law requires each school district, in cooperation with the recognized
112 associations representing licensed educational personnel, to develop a plan to
113 reduce the pupil-teacher ratio per class in certain grade levels and submit that plan
-
*SB81_R1*

– 4 –
114 to the State Board. (NRS 388.720) Section 10 of this bill requires this plan to be
115 submitted to the State Board on or before October 1 of each year.
116 Section 11 of this bill eliminates the requirement for the Department to develop
117 policies and procedures for the distribution of money to each school district for the
118 reduction of pupil-teacher ratios.
119 Existing law requires the sponsor of a charter school that has received, within
120 each of the immediately preceding 3 consecutive school years, one of the two
121 lowest ratings of performance pursuant to the statewide system of accountability for
122 public schools to submit a report to the Joint Interim Standing Committee on
123 Education on or before December 15 of each odd-numbered year describing certain
124 actions taken by the sponsor of the charter school. (NRS 388A.355) Section 14 of
125 this bill requires this report to be submitted annually, on or before February 15.
126 Existing law requires: (1) certain charter schools that are approved to operate as
127 empowerment schools to submit a quarterly report to the Department containing
128 certain financial information and information concerning the school’s compliance
129 with its empowerment plan; (2) the board of trustees of a school district and the
130 Department to conduct financial audits of empowerment schools; and (3) such
131 reports and audits concerning empowerment schools to be compiled and forwarded
132 to certain entities. (NRS 388G.200) Section 16 of this bill eliminates these
133 requirements.
134 Existing law authorizes the board of trustees of a school district or the
135 governing body of a charter school to offer a work-based learning program upon
136 the approval of the Superintendent of Public Instruction. (NRS 389.167) Section 17
137 of this bill eliminates the requirement for a school district or charter school offering
138 a work-based learning program to submit a biennial report to the State Board and
139 the Legislature concerning the manner in which the program has been carried out.
140 Existing law requires the Commission on Professional Standards in Education
141 to prescribe by regulation the qualifications for licensing teachers and other
142 educational personnel. (NRS 391.019) Section 18 of this bill: (1) eliminates the
143 requirement for the Commission to prescribe qualifications for licensing
144 administrators through an alternative route to licensure; and (2) requires the
145 Commission to prescribe qualifications and procedures for licensed teachers and
146 other licensed educational personnel to become licensed as an administrator
147 without restricting the ability of such a person to obtain employment as an
148 administrator.
149 Existing law requires each school district that employs a consultant to submit a
150 report to the Interim Finance Committee at least once every 6 months. (NRS
151 391.155) Section 19 of this bill reduces the frequency of this report to at least once
152 annually.
153 Existing law: (1) establishes the Teach Nevada Scholarship Program, the
154 Nevada Teacher Advancement Scholarship Program and the Incentivizing
155 Pathways to Teaching Grant Program; and (2) sets forth requirements for the
156 administration of these programs. (NRS 391A.550-391A.595, 391A.650-391A.695,
157 391A.700, 391A.705, 391A.710) Sections 20-31 of this bill transfer the
158 administration of these programs from the State Board to the Department. Section
159 19.3 of this bill requires the Department to create a program of block grants to
160 provide one lump-sum grant to an institution that receives a grant from each of
161 these programs. Section 21 expands the eligibility for Teach Nevada Scholarships
162 to include Nevada residents who graduated from high school in another state or
163 who, before the age of 20, successfully completed the high school equivalency
164 assessment selected by the State Board in another state. Section 26 additionally
165 expands the programs for which a student is eligible to receive a Nevada Teacher
166 Advancement Scholarship to include programs which: (1) result in a certificate of
167 advanced study or other degree which is more advanced than a bachelor’s degree,
168 in education or a related field of study; or (2) upon completion, make a student
-
*SB81_R1*

– 5 –
169 eligible to obtain a license and endorsement to teach in a subject area for which
170 there is a shortage of teachers. Sections 22 and 27 eliminate the requirement that
171 the recipient of a Teach Nevada Scholarship or Nevada Teacher Advancement
172 Scholarship meet certain requirements to receive the remaining 25 percent of the
173 scholarship that has not been disbursed. Section 27 also makes a conforming
174 change relating to the amount which may be awarded under the Nevada Teacher
175 Advancement Scholarship Program to reflect the additional programs for which a
176 Nevada Teacher Advancement Scholarship may be awarded as provided in section
177 26. Section 19.7 of this bill creates the Incentivizing Pathways to Teaching Grant
178 Program Account.
179 Section 35 of this bill repeals provisions requiring the Department to: (1)
180 recommend that a minimum amount of money be spent during each fiscal year of
181 the biennium on textbooks, instructional supplies, instructional software and
182 instructional hardware by all school districts, charter schools and university schools
183 for profoundly gifted pupils; and (2) publish a report on school districts, charter
184 schools and university schools for profoundly gifted pupils which did not spend the
185 recommended minimum amount. Section 35 also repeals provisions requiring the
186 board of trustees of each school district to submit an annual report concerning
187 professional development training offered by the school district.

18 shall transfer from the county school district fund to the Education
19 Stabilization Account any amount by which the actual ending fund

TEXT OF REPEALED SECTIONS
387.206 Recommended minimum expenditure by school
districts, charter schools and university schools for profoundly
gifted pupils for textbooks, instructional supplies, instructional
software and instructional hardware.
1. On or before August 1 of each odd-numbered year, the
Department, in consultation with the Budget Division of the Office
of Finance and the Fiscal Analysis Division of the Legislative
Counsel Bureau, shall determine a recommended minimum amount
of money to be expended during each fiscal year of a biennium for
textbooks, instructional supplies, instructional software and
instructional hardware by all school districts, charter schools and
university schools for profoundly gifted pupils. The amount must be
determined by increasing the amount that was established for the
Fiscal Year 2004-2005 by the percentage of the change in
enrollment between Fiscal Year 2004-2005 and the fiscal year for
which the amount is being established, plus any inflationary
adjustment approved by the Legislature after Fiscal Year
2004-2005.
2. The Department, in consultation with the Budget Division of
the Office of Finance and the Fiscal Analysis Division of the
Legislative Counsel Bureau, shall develop or revise, as applicable, a
formula for determining the minimum amount of money that each
school district, charter school and university school for profoundly
gifted pupils is recommended to expend each fiscal year for
textbooks, instructional supplies, instructional software and
instructional hardware. The sum of all of the minimum amounts
determined pursuant to this subsection must be equal to the
combined minimum amount determined pursuant to subsection 1.
The formula must be used only to develop expenditure
-

recommendations and must not be used to alter the yearly
apportionment from the State Education Fund to school districts,
charter schools or university schools for profoundly gifted pupils.
3. Upon approval of the formula pursuant to subsection 2, the
Department shall provide written notice to each school district,
charter school and university school for profoundly gifted pupils on
or before August 15 of each odd-numbered year that sets forth the
recommended minimum combined amount of money that the school
district, charter school and university school for profoundly gifted
pupils may expend for textbooks, instructional supplies,
instructional software and instructional hardware for each fiscal year
of a biennium.
387.2062 Report concerning failure to comply with
recommended minimum expenditure.
1. On or before January 1 of each year, the Department shall
determine whether each school district, charter school and university
school for profoundly gifted pupils has expended, during the
immediately preceding fiscal year, the recommended minimum
amount of money set forth in the notice provided pursuant to
subsection 3 of NRS 387.206. In making this determination, the
Department shall use the report submitted by:
(a) The school district pursuant to NRS 387.303.
(b) The charter school pursuant to NRS 388A.345.
(c) The university school for profoundly gifted pupils pursuant
to NRS 388C.250.
2. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3, if the
Department determines that a school district, charter school or
university school for profoundly gifted pupils, as applicable, has not
expended the recommended minimum amount of money set forth in
the notice or the revised notice, as applicable, provided pursuant to
subsection 3 of NRS 387.206, the Department shall publish a report
on an Internet website maintained by the Department which
identifies the difference between the actual combined expenditure
for textbooks, instructional supplies, instructional software and
instructional hardware and the minimum recommended combined
expenditure set forth in the notice provided pursuant to subsection 3
of NRS 387.206.
3. If the actual enrollment of pupils in a school district, charter
school or university school for profoundly gifted pupils is less than
the enrollment included in the projections used in the biennial
budget of the school district submitted pursuant to NRS 387.303, the
budget of the charter school submitted pursuant to NRS 388A.345
or the report of the university school for profoundly gifted pupils
submitted pursuant to NRS 388C.250, as applicable, the
recommended expenditure for textbooks, instructional supplies,
-

– 46 –
instructional software and instructional hardware pursuant to NRS
387.206 must be reduced proportionately.
391A.205 Submission of annual report concerning
professional development training by board of trustees.
1. On or before December 1 of each year, the board of trustees
of each school district shall submit, on a form prescribed by the
Department, an annual report concerning the professional
development training offered by the school district to the State
Board, the Commission on Professional Standards in Education, the
Joint Interim Standing Committee on Education and the Legislative
Bureau of Educational Accountability and Program Evaluation.
