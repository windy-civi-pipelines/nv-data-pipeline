Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates the Department of Education, which consists of the State Board of
2 Education and the Superintendent of Public Instruction. (NRS 385.010) Section 1 of this bill
3 requires the Department to create and conduct surveys of: (1) public school employees,
4 assessing school climate and working conditions in schools; and (2) public school employees
5 who are leaving employment at a public school. Section 1 additionally: (1) sets forth when
6 such surveys must be administered; (2) sets forth how a school district must use the results of
7 such surveys; (3) prohibits data collected from such surveys from being used in certain
Assembly Amendment No. 956 to Senate Bill No. 81 Second Reprint Page 4
8 evaluations; (4) requires the Department to recognize schools which achieve a certain
9 response rate on such surveys in the statewide system of accountability; and (5) requires the
10 Department to submit annually to the Commission on School Funding and the State Board a
11 report containing data from the surveys.
12 Existing law requires the principal of each school, in consultation with the employees of
13 the school, to prepare a plan to improve the achievement of the pupils enrolled in the school.
14 (NRS 385A.650) Section 2 of this bill requires the plan to be informed by the results of
15 surveys conducted pursuant to section 1.
16 Existing law creates the Education Stabilization Account in the State Education Fund and
17 requires each school district, each year after the close of the previous fiscal year and before
18 the issuance of the State Controller’s annual report, to transfer from the county school district
19 fund to the Education Stabilization Account any amount by which the actual ending fund
20 balance of the county school district fund exceeds 16.6 percent of the total actual expenditures
21 for the fund. (NRS 387.1213) Section 4 of this bill requires each school district to make this
22 transfer after the close of the previous fiscal year and before the close of the then current fiscal
23 year.
24 Existing law establishes certain requirements governing the use of information
25 concerning the average daily enrollment of pupils, including, without limitation: (1) requiring
26 each school district to submit a quarterly report to the Department containing the average
27 daily enrollment of pupils; and (2) providing the method for computing the yearly
28 apportionment to the school district from the State Education Fund. (NRS 387.1223) Section
29 4.5 of this bill applies these provisions to charter schools and university schools for
30 profoundly gifted pupils.
31 Under existing law, certain hospitals and other facilities that provide residential
32 treatment to children and also operate a licensed private school or an accredited
33 educational program approved by the Department are authorized to request
34 reimbursement from the school district or charter school in which a child is enrolled for
35 the cost of providing educational services to the child who is: (1) verified to be a patient
36 or resident of the hospital or facility; (2) attends the private school or educational
37 program for more than 7 school days; and (3) meets certain other requirements. (NRS
38 387.1225) Section 4.7 of this bill: (1) changes the entity from which reimbursement is
39 authorized to be requested to the Department; and (2) makes conforming changes to
40 reflect this change.
41 Under the Pupil-Centered Funding Plan, existing law requires a public school that
42 receives weighted funding for one or more at-risk pupils or pupils who are English learners to
43 use such funding only to provide services to such pupils, which are referred to as “Victory
44 services” and “Zoom services,” respectively. (NRS 387.121, 387.12445) Section 5 of this bill
45 changes the term “Victory services” to “services for at-risk pupils,” and “Zoom services” to
46 “services for pupils who are English learners.”
47 Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district and the governing body
48 of each charter school to submit to the Superintendent of Public Instruction and certain other
49 recipients, on or before November 1 of each year, a report regarding the budget of the school
50 district or charter school. (NRS 387.303, 388A.345) Existing law requires the Superintendent
51 of Public Instruction, on or before November 25 of each year, to submit a compilation of the
52 reports made by each school district and charter school to the Office of Finance in the Office
53 of the Governor and the Fiscal Analysis Division of the Legislative Counsel Bureau. (NRS
54 387.303, 388A.345) Existing law requires the governing body of a university school for
55 profoundly gifted pupils to submit a similar report to the Department of Education on or
56 before November 15 of each year. (NRS 388C.250) Sections 6, 13 and 15 of this bill require
57 these reports to be submitted annually, on or before the Friday of the first week in January that
58 contains 5 business days. Sections 6 and 13 require the compilation of reports to be submitted
59 on or before the last Friday in January.
60 Existing law requires the Governor, on or before January 1 of each year, to compile a
61 report on the status of the finances of the State, including the information published in the
62 most recent annual report regarding the budget of each school district. (NRS 353.333) Section
63 32 of this bill requires that this report be compiled on or before February 15 of each year, to
64 conform with the change made by section 6 to the date by which the compilation of reports
65 regarding the budget of each school district is required to be submitted to the Office of
66 Finance.
Assembly Amendment No. 956 to Senate Bill No. 81 Second Reprint Page 5
67 Existing law requires the clerk of the board of trustees of a county school district to
68 publish a quarterly expenditure report for the school district in a newspaper that meets certain
69 qualifications. (NRS 387.320) Section 7 of this bill requires the expenditure report to instead
70 be published on the Internet website of the county school district.
71 Existing law: (1) provides that the State Board is the sole state agency responsible for the
72 administration of career and technical education; and (2) sets forth actions the State Board is
73 authorized to take in relation to such authority. (NRS 388.360) Section 7.3 of this bill
74 authorizes the State Board to request, rather than direct, the Superintendent of Public
75 Instruction to make studies and investigations relating to career and technical education.
76 Existing law requires the Executive Officer of the State Board to designate a program
77 professional to perform certain duties relating to programs of career and technical education
78 that have received grants of money. (NRS 388.396) Section 7.7 of this bill instead requires the
79 Superintendent of Public Instruction to designate a program professional to perform such
80 duties.
81 Existing law authorizes the board of trustees of a school district, with the approval of the
82 juvenile court and the board of county commissioners, to employ qualified teachers for the
83 instruction of children detained in facilities for the detention of children, alternative programs
84 and juvenile forestry camps. (NRS 388.550) Existing law requires the board of trustees of a
85 school district providing such instruction to report to the Superintendent of Public Instruction
86 at such times and in such manner as the Superintendent of Public Instruction prescribes. (NRS
87 388.570) Section 8 of this bill eliminates the requirement for the board of trustees of such a
88 school district to provide such reports to the Superintendent of Public Instruction.
89 Existing law prohibits the ratio of pupils per licensed teacher in certain classes from
90 exceeding certain ratios during each school quarter of a school year. (NRS 388.700) Existing
91 law requires the board of trustees of each school district to report to the Department, on a
92 quarterly basis, the average daily enrollment of pupils and the ratio of pupils per licensed
93 teacher for certain grade levels. (NRS 388.725) If the ratio of pupils per licensed teacher at
94 one or more elementary schools in a school district exceeds the ratio prescribed by statute
95 during any quarter of a school year, existing law requires the school district to request a
96 variance from the State Board for each such school for the subsequent quarter. (NRS 388.700)
97 Section 12 of this bill eliminates the requirement to submit quarterly reports regarding the
98 average daily enrollment of pupils and the ratio of pupils per licensed teacher for certain grade
99 levels and requires the board of trustees of each school district to instead report such
100 information to the Department only on a semiannual basis each year for: (1) the period
101 beginning on July 1 and ending on September 30; and (2) the period beginning on January 1
102 and ending on March 31. Section 9 of this bill requires a school district to request a variance
103 for an elementary school which exceeds the maximum ratio of pupils per licensed teacher only
104 if the ratio is exceeded during a reporting period. Section 9 also: (1) reduces the frequency of
105 the reports regarding variances requested by school districts which the State Board is required
106 to submit to the Interim Finance Committee from quarterly to semiannually; and (2)
107 eliminates the requirement for the State Board to submit a report to the Legislature regarding
108 variances and the data collected by school districts on the effectiveness of plans to reduce
109 pupil-teacher ratios.
110 Existing law requires each school district, in cooperation with the recognized associations
111 representing licensed educational personnel, to develop a plan to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio
112 per class in certain grade levels and submit that plan to the State Board. (NRS 388.720)
113 Section 10 of this bill requires this plan to be submitted to the State Board on or before
114 October 1 of each year.
115 Section 11 of this bill eliminates the requirement for the Department to develop policies
116 and procedures for the distribution of money to each school district for the reduction of pupil-
117 teacher ratios.
118 Existing law requires the sponsor of a charter school that has received, within each of the
119 immediately preceding 3 consecutive school years, one of the two lowest ratings of
120 performance pursuant to the statewide system of accountability for public schools to submit a
121 report to the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Education on or before December 15 of
122 each odd-numbered year describing certain actions taken by the sponsor of the charter school.
123 (NRS 388A.355) Section 14 of this bill requires this report to be submitted annually, on or
124 before February 15.
Assembly Amendment No. 956 to Senate Bill No. 81 Second Reprint Page 6
125 Existing law requires: (1) certain charter schools that are approved to operate as
126 empowerment schools to submit a quarterly report to the Department containing certain
127 financial information and information concerning the school’s compliance with its
128 empowerment plan; (2) the board of trustees of a school district and the Department to
129 conduct financial audits of empowerment schools; and (3) such reports and audits concerning
130 empowerment schools to be compiled and forwarded to certain entities. (NRS 388G.200)
131 Section 16 of this bill eliminates these requirements.
132 Existing law authorizes the board of trustees of a school district or the governing body of
133 a charter school to offer a work-based learning program upon the approval of the
134 Superintendent of Public Instruction. (NRS 389.167) Section 17 of this bill eliminates the
135 requirement for a school district or charter school offering a work-based learning program to
136 submit a biennial report to the State Board and the Legislature concerning the manner in
137 which the program has been carried out.
138 Existing law requires the Commission on Professional Standards in Education to
139 prescribe by regulation the qualifications for licensing teachers and other educational
140 personnel. (NRS 391.019) Section 18 of this bill: (1) eliminates the requirement for the
141 Commission to prescribe qualifications for licensing administrators through an alternative
142 route to licensure; and (2) requires the Commission to prescribe qualifications and procedures
143 for licensed teachers and other licensed educational personnel to become licensed as an
144 administrator without restricting the ability of such a person to obtain employment as an
145 administrator.
146 Existing law requires each school district that employs a consultant to submit a report to
147 the Interim Finance Committee at least once every 6 months. (NRS 391.155) Section 19 of
148 this bill reduces the frequency of this report to at least once annually.
149 Existing law: (1) establishes the Teach Nevada Scholarship Program, the Nevada Teacher
150 Advancement Scholarship Program and the Incentivizing Pathways to Teaching Grant
151 Program; and (2) sets forth requirements for the administration of these programs. (NRS
152 391A.550-391A.595, 391A.650-391A.695, 391A.700, 391A.705, 391A.710) Sections 20-31
153 of this bill transfer the administration of these programs from the State Board to the
154 Department. Section 19.5 of this bill requires the Department to create a program of block
155 grants to provide one lump-sum grant to an institution that receives a grant from each of these
156 programs. Section 21 expands the eligibility for Teach Nevada Scholarships to include
157 Nevada residents who graduated from high school in another state or who, before the age of
158 20, successfully completed the high school equivalency assessment selected by the State
159 Board in another state. Section 26 additionally expands the programs for which a student is
160 eligible to receive a Nevada Teacher Advancement Scholarship to include programs which:
161 (1) result in a certificate of advanced study or other degree which is more advanced than a
162 bachelor’s degree, in education or a related field of study; or (2) upon completion, make a
163 student eligible to obtain a license and endorsement to teach in a subject area for which there
164 is a shortage of teachers. Section 27 also makes a conforming change relating to the amount
165 which may be awarded under the Nevada Teacher Advancement Scholarship Program to
166 reflect the additional programs for which a Nevada Teacher Advancement Scholarship may be
167 awarded as provided in section 26.
168 Sections 20.5, 21.5, 22 and 24.5 of this bill become effective on July 1, 2027. Section
169 20.5: (1) changes the name of the Teach Nevada Scholarship Program Account to the Teach
170 Nevada Recruitment, Preparation and Retention Program Account; and (2) eliminates the
171 requirement that money in the Account may only be used to award grants to entities to award
172 scholarships pursuant to section 22. Section 21.5 expands the programs whose students are
173 eligible to receive a scholarship from an institution that receives a grant from the Account.
174 Section 22 eliminates the requirement that the recipient of a scholarship provided by an
175 institution which receives a grant from the Account meet certain requirements to receive the
176 remaining 25 percent of the scholarship that has not been disbursed. Section 22 additionally:
177 (1) expands the group of students who may receive such a scholarship; (2) changes the
178 method for determining the maximum amount of a scholarship a student may receive; and (3)
179 requires institutions that receive grants to provide such scholarships to enter an agreement to
180 share data with the Department. Sections 21.5, 22 and 24.5 make conforming changes to
181 reflect the change in the name of the Account.
182 Section 35 of this bill repeals provisions requiring the Department to: (1) recommend that
183 a minimum amount of money be spent during each fiscal year of the biennium on textbooks,
Assembly Amendment No. 956 to Senate Bill No. 81 Second Reprint Page 7
184 instructional supplies, instructional software and instructional hardware by all school districts,
185 charter schools and university schools for profoundly gifted pupils; and (2) publish a report on
186 school districts, charter schools and university schools for profoundly gifted pupils which did
187 not spend the recommended minimum amount. Section 35 also repeals provisions requiring
188 the board of trustees of each school district to submit an annual report concerning professional
189 development training offered by the school district.
190 Section 35.5 of this bill repeals provisions governing the Nevada Teacher Advancement
191 Scholarship Program and the Incentivizing Pathways to Teaching Grant Program, including,
192 without limitation, sections 25-31, on July 1, 2027. Section 35.7 of this bill requires any
193 money that is in the budget account for the Incentivizing Pathways to Teaching Grant
194 Program Account and the Nevada Teacher Advancement Scholarship Program Account on
195 June 30, 2027, to be transferred to the Teach Nevada Scholarship Program Account.

36 Sec. 3. (Deleted by amendment.)
37 Sec. 4. NRS 387.1213 is hereby amended to read as follows:
38 387.1213 1. The Education Stabilization Account is hereby created in the
39 State Education Fund. Except as otherwise provided in this section, each year after
40 the close of the previous fiscal year and before the [issuance of the State
41 Controller’s annual report,] close of the then current fiscal year, each county
42 school district shall transfer from the county school district fund to the Education
43 Stabilization Account any amount by which the actual ending fund balance of the
44 county school district fund exceeds 16.6 percent of the total actual expenditures for
45 the fund. The interest and income earned on the money in the Account, after
46 deducting any applicable charges, must be credited to the Account.
47 2. Money transferred pursuant to subsection 1 to the Education Stabilization
48 Account is a continuing appropriation solely for the purpose of authorizing the
49 expenditure of the transferred money for the purposes set forth in this section.
50 3. The balance in the Education Stabilization Account must not exceed 20
51 percent of the total of all appropriations and authorizations from the State

53 immediately preceding fiscal year. Any money transferred to the Education
Assembly Amendment No. 956 to Senate Bill No. 81 Second Reprint Page 9
1 Stabilization Account which exceeds this amount must instead be transferred to the
2 State Education Fund.
3 4. If the Interim Finance Committee finds that:
4 (a) Upon submission of a request from the Department, the actual enrollment
5 growth for a fiscal year exceeds the projected enrollment growth by an amount that
6 the Interim Finance Committee determines would make a transfer of money to the
7 State Education Fund necessary to fund the excess enrollment;
8 (b) The collection of revenue in any fiscal year will result in the State
9 Education Fund receiving less money than authorized for expenditure from the
10 State Education Fund;

17  the Committee shall by resolution establish an amount of money to transfer from
18 the Education Stabilization Account to the State Education Fund and direct the
19 State Controller to transfer that amount to the State Education Fund. The State
20 Controller shall thereupon make the transfer.
21 5. When determining the actual ending fund balance for the purposes of
22 subsection 1, each county school district shall exclude:
23 (a) Any money deposited in the county school district fund on or before June
24 30, 2020;
25 (b) Any money apportioned to the county school district for capital projects or

31 6. If the Superintendent of Public Instruction determines that the money due
32 from the State Education Fund to a county school district, charter school or
33 university school for profoundly gifted pupils pursuant to NRS 387.185 exceeds the
34 amount of money available in the State Education Fund because of a delay in
35 expected receipts, he or she may request from the Director of the Office of Finance
36 a temporary advance from the Education Stabilization Account for the payment of
37 such money due. Upon receipt of such a request, the Director of the Office of
38 Finance shall make a recommendation to the Interim Finance Committee to
39 approve the temporary advance in whole or in part or to deny the request. If the
40 Interim Finance Committee approves the request in whole or in part, the Director of
41 the Office of Finance shall notify the State Controller and the Fiscal Analysis
42 Division of the Legislative Counsel Bureau of the amount approved by the Interim
43 Finance Committee, and the State Controller shall draw his or her warrant upon
44 receipt of such a notice of approval. Any money which is temporarily advanced

46 repaid by August 31 following the end of the fiscal year in which the temporary
47 advance is made.
48 7. The balance remaining in the State Education Fund, excluding the balance
49 remaining in the Education Stabilization Account, that has not been committed for
50 expenditure on or before June 30 of an odd-numbered fiscal year must be
51 transferred to the Education Stabilization Account to the extent that such a transfer
52 would not cause the balance in the Education Stabilization Account to exceed the
53 limit established in subsection 3.

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates the Department of Education, which consists of the State Board of
2 Education and the Superintendent of Public Instruction. (NRS 385.010) Section 1 of this bill
3 requires the Department to create and conduct surveys of: (1) public school employees,
4 assessing school climate and working conditions in schools; and (2) public school employees
5 who are leaving employment at a public school. Section 1 additionally: (1) sets forth when
6 such surveys must be administered; (2) sets forth how a school district must use the results of
7 such surveys; (3) prohibits data collected from such surveys from being used in certain

Assembly Amendment No. 956 to Senate Bill No. 81 Second Reprint Page 4
8 evaluations; (4) requires the Department to recognize schools which achieve a certain
9 response rate on such surveys in the statewide system of accountability; and (5) requires the
10 Department to submit annually to the Commission on School Funding and the State Board a
11 report containing data from the surveys.
12 Existing law requires the principal of each school, in consultation with the employees of
13 the school, to prepare a plan to improve the achievement of the pupils enrolled in the school.
14 (NRS 385A.650) Section 2 of this bill requires the plan to be informed by the results of
15 surveys conducted pursuant to section 1.
16 Existing law creates the Education Stabilization Account in the State Education Fund and
17 requires each school district, each year after the close of the previous fiscal year and before
18 the issuance of the State Controller’s annual report, to transfer from the county school district
19 fund to the Education Stabilization Account any amount by which the actual ending fund
20 balance of the county school district fund exceeds 16.6 percent of the total actual expenditures
21 for the fund. (NRS 387.1213) Section 4 of this bill requires each school district to make this
22 transfer after the close of the previous fiscal year and before the close of the then current fiscal
23 year.
24 Existing law establishes certain requirements governing the use of information
25 concerning the average daily enrollment of pupils, including, without limitation: (1) requiring
26 each school district to submit a quarterly report to the Department containing the average
27 daily enrollment of pupils; and (2) providing the method for computing the yearly
28 apportionment to the school district from the State Education Fund. (NRS 387.1223) Section
29 4.5 of this bill applies these provisions to charter schools and university schools for
30 profoundly gifted pupils.
31 Under existing law, certain hospitals and other facilities that provide residential
32 treatment to children and also operate a licensed private school or an accredited
33 educational program approved by the Department are authorized to request
34 reimbursement from the school district or charter school in which a child is enrolled for
35 the cost of providing educational services to the child who is: (1) verified to be a patient
36 or resident of the hospital or facility; (2) attends the private school or educational
37 program for more than 7 school days; and (3) meets certain other requirements. (NRS
38 387.1225) Section 4.7 of this bill: (1) changes the entity from which reimbursement is
39 authorized to be requested to the Department; and (2) makes conforming changes to
40 reflect this change.
41 Under the Pupil-Centered Funding Plan, existing law requires a public school that
42 receives weighted funding for one or more at-risk pupils or pupils who are English learners to
43 use such funding only to provide services to such pupils, which are referred to as “Victory
44 services” and “Zoom services,” respectively. (NRS 387.121, 387.12445) Section 5 of this bill
45 changes the term “Victory services” to “services for at-risk pupils,” and “Zoom services” to
46 “services for pupils who are English learners.”
47 Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district and the governing body
48 of each charter school to submit to the Superintendent of Public Instruction and certain other
49 recipients, on or before November 1 of each year, a report regarding the budget of the school
50 district or charter school. (NRS 387.303, 388A.345) Existing law requires the Superintendent
51 of Public Instruction, on or before November 25 of each year, to submit a compilation of the
52 reports made by each school district and charter school to the Office of Finance in the Office
53 of the Governor and the Fiscal Analysis Division of the Legislative Counsel Bureau. (NRS
54 387.303, 388A.345) Existing law requires the governing body of a university school for
55 profoundly gifted pupils to submit a similar report to the Department of Education on or
56 before November 15 of each year. (NRS 388C.250) Sections 6, 13 and 15 of this bill require
57 these reports to be submitted annually, on or before the Friday of the first week in January that
58 contains 5 business days. Sections 6 and 13 require the compilation of reports to be submitted
59 on or before the last Friday in January.
60 Existing law requires the Governor, on or before January 1 of each year, to compile a
61 report on the status of the finances of the State, including the information published in the
62 most recent annual report regarding the budget of each school district. (NRS 353.333) Section
63 32 of this bill requires that this report be compiled on or before February 15 of each year, to
64 conform with the change made by section 6 to the date by which the compilation of reports
65 regarding the budget of each school district is required to be submitted to the Office of
66 Finance.

Assembly Amendment No. 956 to Senate Bill No. 81 Second Reprint Page 5
67 Existing law requires the clerk of the board of trustees of a county school district to
68 publish a quarterly expenditure report for the school district in a newspaper that meets certain
69 qualifications. (NRS 387.320) Section 7 of this bill requires the expenditure report to instead
70 be published on the Internet website of the county school district.
71 Existing law: (1) provides that the State Board is the sole state agency responsible for the
72 administration of career and technical education; and (2) sets forth actions the State Board is
73 authorized to take in relation to such authority. (NRS 388.360) Section 7.3 of this bill
74 authorizes the State Board to request, rather than direct, the Superintendent of Public
75 Instruction to make studies and investigations relating to career and technical education.
76 Existing law requires the Executive Officer of the State Board to designate a program
77 professional to perform certain duties relating to programs of career and technical education
78 that have received grants of money. (NRS 388.396) Section 7.7 of this bill instead requires the
79 Superintendent of Public Instruction to designate a program professional to perform such
80 duties.
81 Existing law authorizes the board of trustees of a school district, with the approval of the
82 juvenile court and the board of county commissioners, to employ qualified teachers for the
83 instruction of children detained in facilities for the detention of children, alternative programs
84 and juvenile forestry camps. (NRS 388.550) Existing law requires the board of trustees of a
85 school district providing such instruction to report to the Superintendent of Public Instruction
86 at such times and in such manner as the Superintendent of Public Instruction prescribes. (NRS
87 388.570) Section 8 of this bill eliminates the requirement for the board of trustees of such a
88 school district to provide such reports to the Superintendent of Public Instruction.
89 Existing law prohibits the ratio of pupils per licensed teacher in certain classes from
90 exceeding certain ratios during each school quarter of a school year. (NRS 388.700) Existing
91 law requires the board of trustees of each school district to report to the Department, on a
92 quarterly basis, the average daily enrollment of pupils and the ratio of pupils per licensed
93 teacher for certain grade levels. (NRS 388.725) If the ratio of pupils per licensed teacher at
94 one or more elementary schools in a school district exceeds the ratio prescribed by statute
95 during any quarter of a school year, existing law requires the school district to request a
96 variance from the State Board for each such school for the subsequent quarter. (NRS 388.700)
97 Section 12 of this bill eliminates the requirement to submit quarterly reports regarding the
98 average daily enrollment of pupils and the ratio of pupils per licensed teacher for certain grade
99 levels and requires the board of trustees of each school district to instead report such
100 information to the Department only on a semiannual basis each year for: (1) the period
101 beginning on July 1 and ending on September 30; and (2) the period beginning on January 1
102 and ending on March 31. Section 9 of this bill requires a school district to request a variance
103 for an elementary school which exceeds the maximum ratio of pupils per licensed teacher only
104 if the ratio is exceeded during a reporting period. Section 9 also: (1) reduces the frequency of
105 the reports regarding variances requested by school districts which the State Board is required
106 to submit to the Interim Finance Committee from quarterly to semiannually; and (2)
107 eliminates the requirement for the State Board to submit a report to the Legislature regarding
108 variances and the data collected by school districts on the effectiveness of plans to reduce
109 pupil-teacher ratios.
110 Existing law requires each school district, in cooperation with the recognized associations
111 representing licensed educational personnel, to develop a plan to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio
112 per class in certain grade levels and submit that plan to the State Board. (NRS 388.720)
113 Section 10 of this bill requires this plan to be submitted to the State Board on or before
114 October 1 of each year.
115 Section 11 of this bill eliminates the requirement for the Department to develop policies
116 and procedures for the distribution of money to each school district for the reduction of pupil-
117 teacher ratios.
118 Existing law requires the sponsor of a charter school that has received, within each of the
119 immediately preceding 3 consecutive school years, one of the two lowest ratings of
120 performance pursuant to the statewide system of accountability for public schools to submit a
121 report to the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Education on or before December 15 of
122 each odd-numbered year describing certain actions taken by the sponsor of the charter school.
123 (NRS 388A.355) Section 14 of this bill requires this report to be submitted annually, on or
124 before February 15.

Assembly Amendment No. 956 to Senate Bill No. 81 Second Reprint Page 6
125 Existing law requires: (1) certain charter schools that are approved to operate as
126 empowerment schools to submit a quarterly report to the Department containing certain
127 financial information and information concerning the school’s compliance with its
128 empowerment plan; (2) the board of trustees of a school district and the Department to
129 conduct financial audits of empowerment schools; and (3) such reports and audits concerning
130 empowerment schools to be compiled and forwarded to certain entities. (NRS 388G.200)
131 Section 16 of this bill eliminates these requirements.
132 Existing law authorizes the board of trustees of a school district or the governing body of
133 a charter school to offer a work-based learning program upon the approval of the
134 Superintendent of Public Instruction. (NRS 389.167) Section 17 of this bill eliminates the
135 requirement for a school district or charter school offering a work-based learning program to
136 submit a biennial report to the State Board and the Legislature concerning the manner in
137 which the program has been carried out.
138 Existing law requires the Commission on Professional Standards in Education to
139 prescribe by regulation the qualifications for licensing teachers and other educational
140 personnel. (NRS 391.019) Section 18 of this bill: (1) eliminates the requirement for the
141 Commission to prescribe qualifications for licensing administrators through an alternative
142 route to licensure; and (2) requires the Commission to prescribe qualifications and procedures
143 for licensed teachers and other licensed educational personnel to become licensed as an
144 administrator without restricting the ability of such a person to obtain employment as an
145 administrator.
146 Existing law requires each school district that employs a consultant to submit a report to
147 the Interim Finance Committee at least once every 6 months. (NRS 391.155) Section 19 of
148 this bill reduces the frequency of this report to at least once annually.
149 Existing law: (1) establishes the Teach Nevada Scholarship Program, the Nevada Teacher
150 Advancement Scholarship Program and the Incentivizing Pathways to Teaching Grant
151 Program; and (2) sets forth requirements for the administration of these programs. (NRS
152 391A.550-391A.595, 391A.650-391A.695, 391A.700, 391A.705, 391A.710) Sections 20-31
153 of this bill transfer the administration of these programs from the State Board to the
154 Department. Section 19.5 of this bill requires the Department to create a program of block
155 grants to provide one lump-sum grant to an institution that receives a grant from each of these
156 programs. Section 21 expands the eligibility for Teach Nevada Scholarships to include
157 Nevada residents who graduated from high school in another state or who, before the age of
158 20, successfully completed the high school equivalency assessment selected by the State
159 Board in another state. Section 26 additionally expands the programs for which a student is
160 eligible to receive a Nevada Teacher Advancement Scholarship to include programs which:
161 (1) result in a certificate of advanced study or other degree which is more advanced than a
162 bachelor’s degree, in education or a related field of study; or (2) upon completion, make a
163 student eligible to obtain a license and endorsement to teach in a subject area for which there
164 is a shortage of teachers. Section 27 also makes a conforming change relating to the amount
165 which may be awarded under the Nevada Teacher Advancement Scholarship Program to
166 reflect the additional programs for which a Nevada Teacher Advancement Scholarship may be
167 awarded as provided in section 26.
168 Sections 20.5, 21.5, 22 and 24.5 of this bill become effective on July 1, 2027. Section
169 20.5: (1) changes the name of the Teach Nevada Scholarship Program Account to the Teach
170 Nevada Recruitment, Preparation and Retention Program Account; and (2) eliminates the
171 requirement that money in the Account may only be used to award grants to entities to award
172 scholarships pursuant to section 22. Section 21.5 expands the programs whose students are
173 eligible to receive a scholarship from an institution that receives a grant from the Account.
174 Section 22 eliminates the requirement that the recipient of a scholarship provided by an
175 institution which receives a grant from the Account meet certain requirements to receive the
176 remaining 25 percent of the scholarship that has not been disbursed. Section 22 additionally:
177 (1) expands the group of students who may receive such a scholarship; (2) changes the
178 method for determining the maximum amount of a scholarship a student may receive; and (3)
179 requires institutions that receive grants to provide such scholarships to enter an agreement to
180 share data with the Department. Sections 21.5, 22 and 24.5 make conforming changes to
181 reflect the change in the name of the Account.
182 Section 35 of this bill repeals provisions requiring the Department to: (1) recommend that
183 a minimum amount of money be spent during each fiscal year of the biennium on textbooks,

Assembly Amendment No. 956 to Senate Bill No. 81 Second Reprint Page 7
184 instructional supplies, instructional software and instructional hardware by all school districts,
185 charter schools and university schools for profoundly gifted pupils; and (2) publish a report on
186 school districts, charter schools and university schools for profoundly gifted pupils which did
187 not spend the recommended minimum amount. Section 35 also repeals provisions requiring
188 the board of trustees of each school district to submit an annual report concerning professional
189 development training offered by the school district.
190 Section 35.5 of this bill repeals provisions governing the Nevada Teacher Advancement
191 Scholarship Program and the Incentivizing Pathways to Teaching Grant Program, including,
192 without limitation, sections 25-31, on July 1, 2027. Section 35.7 of this bill requires any
193 money that is in the budget account for the Incentivizing Pathways to Teaching Grant
194 Program Account and the Nevada Teacher Advancement Scholarship Program Account on
195 June 30, 2027, to be transferred to the Teach Nevada Scholarship Program Account.

42 school district shall transfer from the county school district fund to the Education
43 Stabilization Account any amount by which the actual ending fund balance of the
44 county school district fund exceeds 16.6 percent of the total actual expenditures for
45 the fund. The interest and income earned on the money in the Account, after
46 deducting any applicable charges, must be credited to the Account.
47 2. Money transferred pursuant to subsection 1 to the Education Stabilization
48 Account is a continuing appropriation solely for the purpose of authorizing the
49 expenditure of the transferred money for the purposes set forth in this section.
50 3. The balance in the Education Stabilization Account must not exceed 20
51 percent of the total of all appropriations and authorizations from the State

2 State Education Fund.
3 4. If the Interim Finance Committee finds that:
4 (a) Upon submission of a request from the Department, the actual enrollment
5 growth for a fiscal year exceeds the projected enrollment growth by an amount that
6 the Interim Finance Committee determines would make a transfer of money to the
7 State Education Fund necessary to fund the excess enrollment;
8 (b) The collection of revenue in any fiscal year will result in the State
9 Education Fund receiving less money than authorized for expenditure from the
10 State Education Fund;

19 State Controller to transfer that amount to the State Education Fund. The State
20 Controller shall thereupon make the transfer.
21 5. When determining the actual ending fund balance for the purposes of
22 subsection 1, each county school district shall exclude:
23 (a) Any money deposited in the county school district fund on or before June

6 less than or equal to 95 percent of the enrollment of pupils in the same school
7 district or charter school based on the average daily enrollment of pupils during the

10 purposes of making the monthly apportionments from the State Education Fund to
