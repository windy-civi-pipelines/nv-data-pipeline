~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to motor vehicles; revising provisions governing the disposition
of certain vehicles abandoned on public or private property; revising
[the value of a vehicle for which a] provisions governing the issuance
of junk [certificate may be issued] certificates by the Department of
Motor Vehicles; revising provisions governing lists of operators of
tow cars used by law enforcement agencies; prohibiting the operator
of a tow car from falsely reporting the location of the operator or tow
car to a law enforcement agency for certain purposes; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law: (1) authorizes certain persons and law enforcement agencies to request the
2 removal of a vehicle that has been abandoned on public or private property; and (2) requires
3 the person who requests such a removal to inquire into whether the vehicle was stolen and the
4 identity of the vehicle’s owner. (NRS 487.230, 487.235) Existing law requires a person who
5 removed an abandoned vehicle to notify the registered owner and any person having a security
6 interest in the vehicle by registered or certified mail that the vehicle has been removed and
7 will be junked, dismantled or otherwise disposed of unless the owner or the person having the
8 security interest responds and pays the costs of removal. (NRS 487.250) Existing law
9 additionally requires a tow operator to notify the registered and legal owner of a vehicle if the
10 vehicle was towed and placed in storage at the request of someone other than the owner or the
11 owner’s authorized agent. (NRS 706.4479)
12 Existing law authorizes the Department of Motor Vehicles to issue a junk certificate to a
13 tow operator or automobile wrecker for a vehicle that: (1) has been discarded or abandoned;
14 (2) has been ruined, wrecked, dismantled or rendered inoperative; (3) is unfit for further use in
15 accordance with the vehicle’s original purpose; (4) is unregistered or is not reclaimed by the
16 registered owner or person having a security interest in the vehicle within a certain period of
17 time; and (5) has value principally as scrap which does not exceed $200. (NRS 487.260)
18 Section 4 of this bill increases the value of a vehicle for which a junk certificate may be
19 issued to include a vehicle which has value principally as scrap which does not exceed $500.
Assembly Amendment No. 93 to Assembly Bill No. 415 Page 4
20 Section 4 authorizes the Department to issue a junk certificate for a vehicle that is
21 appraised as a junk vehicle by an automobile wrecker or tow operator in accordance
22 with regulations prescribed by the Department. Sections 1 and 2 of this bill authorize
23 certain persons, with respect to an abandoned, unregistered vehicle which appears likely to be
24 appraised as a junk vehicle and for which the identity of the owner is not known or readily
25 ascertainable, to affix to the vehicle a notice that if the abandoned vehicle is not removed from
26 the public or private property within [5] 7 days, the vehicle is subject to being junked,
27 dismantled or otherwise disposed of. Sections 1 and 2 require the notice to include certain
28 information, including that the owner of the vehicle may request an expedited hearing in
29 the local justice court to contest the classification of the vehicle as an abandoned junk
30 vehicle. If [this] the notice is affixed to [an] certain unregistered [vehicle] vehicles which [is]
31 are appraised as [a] junk [vehicle,] vehicles, sections 1-5 of this bill excuse the person or law
32 enforcement agency that authorized the removal of the vehicle and the tow operator who
33 removed the vehicle from other provisions requiring such persons to make inquiries into the
34 identity of the owner of the vehicle and provide the owner with certain notice regarding the
35 removal of the vehicle. Section 4 requires the person or law enforcement agency that
36 authorized the removal of the vehicle to provide the contact information of the automobile
37 wrecker or tow operator who removed the vehicle if contacted by the vehicle’s owner.
38 [Section 4 authorizes an automobile wrecker or tow operator who receives a junk certificate
39 for an abandoned vehicle to which such a notice has been affixed to dispose of the vehicle not
40 earlier than 48 hours after the vehicle arrives and is registered at the place of storage.]
41 Existing law prohibits a law enforcement agency that maintains and uses a list of tow cars
42 which are called by that agency to provide towing from including an operator of a tow car on
43 that list unless the operator meets certain requirements. Existing law prohibits the Nevada
44 Highway Patrol from removing an operator of a tow car from the list used by the
45 Nevada Highway Patrol solely on the ground that the operator is insured under the same
46 policy of insurance as one other operator of a tow car who is included on the list and
47 operates in the same geographical area. (NRS 706.4485)
48 Section 6 of this bill : (1) expands the applicability of this prohibition to all law
49 enforcement agencies; and (2) prohibits an operator of a tow car from using any software,
50 device or other means to falsely report the location of the operator or tow car to a law
51 enforcement agency or any agent of a law enforcement agency for the purpose of securing a
52 request from the law enforcement agency to provide towing services. Section 6 requires a
53 law enforcement agency to remove an operator of a tow car from the list used by the law
54 enforcement agency for 1 year if the operator violates that prohibition.

17 (b) The vehicle is not registered with the Department [or] and it is not readily
18 ascertainable whether the vehicle is registered in any other state; and

20 ascertainable,
21  an operator of a tow car, an automobile wrecker or, in the case of a vehicle
22 abandoned on public property, a state agency or political subdivision, may, before
23 the removal of a vehicle pursuant to this section, affix a notice to the vehicle
24 stating that the vehicle, if not removed from the property within [5] 7 days, is
25 subject to being junked, dismantled or otherwise disposed of without further
26 notice. The notice must state the date and time that the notice was affixed to the
27 vehicle [.] and that the owner of the vehicle may, at any time before the vehicle is
28 removed from the property, request an expedited hearing in the justice court of
29 the township where the property on which the vehicle was purportedly abandoned
30 is located to contest the classification of the vehicle as an abandoned junk
31 vehicle.

37 a vehicle has been abandoned on public lands, the sheriff’s office or other law
38 enforcement agency shall:
39 (a) Make all practical inquiries to ascertain if the vehicle is stolen by checking
40 the license plate number, vehicle identification number and other available
41 information which will aid in identifying the owner of the vehicle; and
42 (b) If the vehicle has not been reported as stolen and the sheriff’s office or
43 other law enforcement agency is able to determine the identity of the owner of the
44 vehicle, notify the Department of those facts.
45 2. Upon the receipt of a notice from a sheriff’s office or other law
46 enforcement agency pursuant to paragraph (b) of subsection 1 and if the registration
47 of the vehicle has not expired, the Department shall send by registered or certified
48 mail, return receipt requested, a written notice to the owner of the vehicle stating
49 that the owner must remove or cause the vehicle to be removed from the public

11  the Department shall suspend the registration of each vehicle currently registered
12 to the owner pursuant to chapter 482 of NRS. For the purposes of this subsection,

14 notified the Department pursuant to paragraph (b) of subsection 1 is conclusive as
15 to whether the abandoned vehicle was removed within the 30-day period.
16 5. If the registration of a vehicle is suspended pursuant to subsection 4, the
17 Department shall reinstate the registration upon receipt from the registered owner
18 of the vehicle of:
19 (a) An affidavit setting forth that the registered owner caused the removal and
20 disposition of, or proof that the registered owner paid the cost of removal and

32 the vehicle stating that the vehicle, if not removed from the property within [5] 7

39 abandoned junk vehicle.

41 or another governmental entity that a vehicle has been abandoned on public lands,
42 the sheriff’s office or other law enforcement agency shall, insofar as practicable and
43 authorized by law, inform the person or entity making such notification of the
44 actions taken by the sheriff’s office or other law enforcement agency pursuant to
45 this section.
46 8. As used in this section, “junk vehicle” has the meaning ascribed to it in

SUMMARY—Revises provisions governing the towing of motor vehicles.
(BDR 43-821)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to motor vehicles; revising provisions governing the disposition
of certain vehicles abandoned on public or private property; revising
[the value of a vehicle for which a] provisions governing the issuance
of junk [certificate may be issued] certificates by the Department of
Motor Vehicles; revising provisions governing lists of operators of
tow cars used by law enforcement agencies; prohibiting the operator
of a tow car from falsely reporting the location of the operator or tow
car to a law enforcement agency for certain purposes; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law: (1) authorizes certain persons and law enforcement agencies to request the
2 removal of a vehicle that has been abandoned on public or private property; and (2) requires
3 the person who requests such a removal to inquire into whether the vehicle was stolen and the
4 identity of the vehicle’s owner. (NRS 487.230, 487.235) Existing law requires a person who
5 removed an abandoned vehicle to notify the registered owner and any person having a security
6 interest in the vehicle by registered or certified mail that the vehicle has been removed and
7 will be junked, dismantled or otherwise disposed of unless the owner or the person having the
8 security interest responds and pays the costs of removal. (NRS 487.250) Existing law
9 additionally requires a tow operator to notify the registered and legal owner of a vehicle if the
10 vehicle was towed and placed in storage at the request of someone other than the owner or the
11 owner’s authorized agent. (NRS 706.4479)
12 Existing law authorizes the Department of Motor Vehicles to issue a junk certificate to a
13 tow operator or automobile wrecker for a vehicle that: (1) has been discarded or abandoned;
14 (2) has been ruined, wrecked, dismantled or rendered inoperative; (3) is unfit for further use in
15 accordance with the vehicle’s original purpose; (4) is unregistered or is not reclaimed by the
16 registered owner or person having a security interest in the vehicle within a certain period of
17 time; and (5) has value principally as scrap which does not exceed $200. (NRS 487.260)
18 Section 4 of this bill increases the value of a vehicle for which a junk certificate may be
19 issued to include a vehicle which has value principally as scrap which does not exceed $500.

Assembly Amendment No. 93 to Assembly Bill No. 415 Page 4
20 Section 4 authorizes the Department to issue a junk certificate for a vehicle that is
21 appraised as a junk vehicle by an automobile wrecker or tow operator in accordance
22 with regulations prescribed by the Department. Sections 1 and 2 of this bill authorize
23 certain persons, with respect to an abandoned, unregistered vehicle which appears likely to be
24 appraised as a junk vehicle and for which the identity of the owner is not known or readily
25 ascertainable, to affix to the vehicle a notice that if the abandoned vehicle is not removed from
26 the public or private property within [5] 7 days, the vehicle is subject to being junked,
27 dismantled or otherwise disposed of. Sections 1 and 2 require the notice to include certain
28 information, including that the owner of the vehicle may request an expedited hearing in
29 the local justice court to contest the classification of the vehicle as an abandoned junk
30 vehicle. If [this] the notice is affixed to [an] certain unregistered [vehicle] vehicles which [is]
31 are appraised as [a] junk [vehicle,] vehicles, sections 1-5 of this bill excuse the person or law
32 enforcement agency that authorized the removal of the vehicle and the tow operator who
33 removed the vehicle from other provisions requiring such persons to make inquiries into the
34 identity of the owner of the vehicle and provide the owner with certain notice regarding the
35 removal of the vehicle. Section 4 requires the person or law enforcement agency that
36 authorized the removal of the vehicle to provide the contact information of the automobile
37 wrecker or tow operator who removed the vehicle if contacted by the vehicle’s owner.
38 [Section 4 authorizes an automobile wrecker or tow operator who receives a junk certificate
39 for an abandoned vehicle to which such a notice has been affixed to dispose of the vehicle not
40 earlier than 48 hours after the vehicle arrives and is registered at the place of storage.]
41 Existing law prohibits a law enforcement agency that maintains and uses a list of tow cars
42 which are called by that agency to provide towing from including an operator of a tow car on
43 that list unless the operator meets certain requirements. Existing law prohibits the Nevada
44 Highway Patrol from removing an operator of a tow car from the list used by the
45 Nevada Highway Patrol solely on the ground that the operator is insured under the same
46 policy of insurance as one other operator of a tow car who is included on the list and
47 operates in the same geographical area. (NRS 706.4485)
48 Section 6 of this bill : (1) expands the applicability of this prohibition to all law
49 enforcement agencies; and (2) prohibits an operator of a tow car from using any software,
50 device or other means to falsely report the location of the operator or tow car to a law
51 enforcement agency or any agent of a law enforcement agency for the purpose of securing a
52 request from the law enforcement agency to provide towing services. Section 6 requires a
53 law enforcement agency to remove an operator of a tow car from the list used by the law
54 enforcement agency for 1 year if the operator violates that prohibition.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 487.230 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 487.230 1. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 487.235, any sheriff or

12 has been abandoned on public property in his or her jurisdiction may remove the
13 vehicle from that property or cause the vehicle to be removed from that property.

Assembly Amendment No. 93 to Assembly Bill No. 415 Page 5
1 the vehicle may be removed by the operator of a tow car or an automobile wrecker
2 from that private property.
3 2. [A] Except as otherwise provided in NRS 487.260, a person who
4 authorizes the removal of an abandoned vehicle pursuant to subsection 1 shall:
5 (a) Have the vehicle taken to the nearest garage or other place designated for
6 storage by:
7 (1) The state agency or political subdivision making the request if the
8 vehicle is removed from public property.
9 (2) The owner or person in possession or control of the property if the
10 vehicle is removed from private property.
11 (b) Make all practical inquiries to ascertain if the vehicle is stolen by checking
12 the license plate number, vehicle identification number and other available
13 information which will aid in identifying the registered and legal owner of the
14 vehicle and supply the information to the person who is storing the vehicle.
15 3. If:
16 (a) The vehicle appears likely to be appraised as a junk vehicle;
17 (b) The vehicle is not registered with the Department [or] and it is not readily
18 ascertainable whether the vehicle is registered in any other state; and
19 (c) The identity of the owner of the vehicle is not known or readily
20 ascertainable,
21  an operator of a tow car, an automobile wrecker or, in the case of a vehicle
22 abandoned on public property, a state agency or political subdivision, may, before
23 the removal of a vehicle pursuant to this section, affix a notice to the vehicle
24 stating that the vehicle, if not removed from the property within [5] 7 days, is
25 subject to being junked, dismantled or otherwise disposed of without further
26 notice. The notice must state the date and time that the notice was affixed to the
27 vehicle [.] and that the owner of the vehicle may, at any time before the vehicle is
28 removed from the property, request an expedited hearing in the justice court of
29 the township where the property on which the vehicle was purportedly abandoned
30 is located to contest the classification of the vehicle as an abandoned junk
31 vehicle.
32 4. As used in this section, “junk vehicle” has the meaning ascribed to it in
33 NRS 487.260.
34 Sec. 2. NRS 487.235 is hereby amended to read as follows:
35 487.235 1. [If] Except as otherwise provided in NRS 487.260, if a sheriff’s
36 office or other law enforcement agency discovers that, or receives notification that,
37 a vehicle has been abandoned on public lands, the sheriff’s office or other law
38 enforcement agency shall:
39 (a) Make all practical inquiries to ascertain if the vehicle is stolen by checking
40 the license plate number, vehicle identification number and other available
41 information which will aid in identifying the owner of the vehicle; and
42 (b) If the vehicle has not been reported as stolen and the sheriff’s office or
43 other law enforcement agency is able to determine the identity of the owner of the
44 vehicle, notify the Department of those facts.
45 2. Upon the receipt of a notice from a sheriff’s office or other law
46 enforcement agency pursuant to paragraph (b) of subsection 1 and if the registration
47 of the vehicle has not expired, the Department shall send by registered or certified
48 mail, return receipt requested, a written notice to the owner of the vehicle stating
49 that the owner must remove or cause the vehicle to be removed from the public
50 lands within 30 days after the date on which the notice was sent.
51 3. If an owner receives a notice pursuant to subsection 2, the owner may
52 submit to the Department an affidavit which states that the owner has taken action

Assembly Amendment No. 93 to Assembly Bill No. 415 Page 6
1 which meets the requirements of paragraph (a) or (b) of subsection 2 of NRS
2 487.220. If the owner submits such an affidavit, the Department:

10 (c) Does not submit an affidavit as described in subsection 3,
11  the Department shall suspend the registration of each vehicle currently registered
12 to the owner pursuant to chapter 482 of NRS. For the purposes of this subsection,
13 the determination of the sheriff’s office or other law enforcement agency that
14 notified the Department pursuant to paragraph (b) of subsection 1 is conclusive as
15 to whether the abandoned vehicle was removed within the 30-day period.
16 5. If the registration of a vehicle is suspended pursuant to subsection 4, the
17 Department shall reinstate the registration upon receipt from the registered owner
18 of the vehicle of:
19 (a) An affidavit setting forth that the registered owner caused the removal and
20 disposition of, or proof that the registered owner paid the cost of removal and
21 disposition of, the vehicle discovered abandoned upon public lands; and
22 (b) If applicable, proof that the registered owner redeemed any lien placed
23 pursuant to NRS 487.270 on the vehicle discovered abandoned on public lands.
24 6. If a vehicle has been abandoned on public lands and:
25 (a) The vehicle appears likely to be appraised as a junk vehicle;

27 ascertainable whether the vehicle is registered in any other state; and
28 (c) The identity of the owner of the vehicle is not known or readily
29 ascertainable,
30  the sheriff’s office or other law enforcement agency, an operator of a tow car
31 or an automobile wrecker may, before the removal of the vehicle, affix a notice to
32 the vehicle stating that the vehicle, if not removed from the property within [5] 7
33 days, is subject to being junked, dismantled or otherwise disposed of without
34 further notice. The notice must state the date and time that the notice was affixed
35 to the vehicle [.] and state that the owner of the vehicle may, at any time before

37 justice court of the township where the property on which the vehicle was
38 purportedly abandoned is located to contest the classification of the vehicle as an
39 abandoned junk vehicle.
40 7. If a sheriff’s office or other law enforcement agency is notified by a person
41 or another governmental entity that a vehicle has been abandoned on public lands,
42 the sheriff’s office or other law enforcement agency shall, insofar as practicable and
43 authorized by law, inform the person or entity making such notification of the
44 actions taken by the sheriff’s office or other law enforcement agency pursuant to
45 this section.
46 8. As used in this section, “junk vehicle” has the meaning ascribed to it in
47 NRS 487.260.
48 Sec. 3. NRS 487.250 is hereby amended to read as follows:
49 487.250 1. The state agency or political subdivision shall, within 48 hours
50 after the appraisal, notify the head of the state agency of the removal of the vehicle.

2 otherwise disposed of.
3 2. [The] Except as otherwise provided in NRS 487.260, the person who
4 removed the vehicle must notify the registered owner and any person having a
5 security interest in the vehicle by registered or certified mail that the vehicle has
6 been removed and will be junked or dismantled or otherwise disposed of unless the
7 registered owner or the person having a security interest in the vehicle responds and
8 pays the costs of removal.
9 3. Failure to reclaim within 15 days after notification a vehicle appraised at
10 $500 or less constitutes a waiver of interest in the vehicle by any person having an
11 interest in the vehicle.
12 4. If all recorded interests in a vehicle appraised at $500 or less are waived,
13 either as provided in subsection 3 or by written disclaimer by any person having an

18 retain the vehicle and the vehicle is equipped as required by chapter 484D of NRS.

20 487.260 1. If the vehicle is appraised at a value of more than $500, the state
21 agency or political subdivision shall dispose of it as provided in NRS 487.270.

23 automobile wrecker or tow operator pursuant to such regulations as the
24 Department may prescribe, the Department may issue a junk certificate to the
25 automobile wrecker or tow operator who removed the vehicle.
26 3. If a notice is affixed to a vehicle pursuant to subsection 3 of NRS 487.230
27 or subsection 6 of NRS 487.235, the vehicle is not registered with the Department
28 [or] , it is not readily ascertainable whether the vehicle is registered in any other
29 state and the vehicle is appraised as a junk vehicle, the automobile wrecker or
30 tow operator who removed the vehicle:

32 removal of the vehicle of that fact, and the person or agency:
33 (1) Is relieved of the duty to:

36 (II) Provide notice to the registered owner and any person having a
37 security interest in the vehicle pursuant to subsection 2 of NRS 487.250.

52 junk certificate has been issued shall immediately affix the business name of the
53 automobile wrecker as purchaser to the first available space provided on the reverse

Assembly Amendment No. 93 to Assembly Bill No. 415 Page 8
1 side of the certificate. For the purposes of this subsection, such an automobile
2 wrecker is the owner of the junk vehicle.
3 [5.] 6. If insufficient space exists on the reverse side of a junk certificate to
4 transfer the vehicle pursuant to subsection [4,] 5, except as otherwise provided in
5 subsection 3 of NRS 487.100, an automobile wrecker who purchases a junk vehicle
6 for which a junk certificate has been previously issued shall, within 10 days after

26 Sec. 5. NRS 706.4479 is hereby amended to read as follows:
27 706.4479 1. [If] Except as otherwise provided in NRS 487.260, if a motor
