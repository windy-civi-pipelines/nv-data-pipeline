SUMMARY—Revises provisions governing the towing of motor
vehicles. (BDR 43-821)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to motor vehicles; revising provisions governing
the disposition of certain vehicles abandoned on public or
private property; revising the value of a vehicle for which
a junk certificate may be issued by the Department of
Motor Vehicles; prohibiting the operator of a tow car
from falsely reporting the location of the operator or tow
car to a law enforcement agency for certain purposes; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law: (1) authorizes certain persons and law enforcement agencies to
2 request the removal of a vehicle that has been abandoned on public or private
3 property; and (2) requires the person who requests such a removal to inquire into
4 whether the vehicle was stolen and the identity of the vehicle’s owner. (NRS
5 487.230, 487.235) Existing law requires a person who removed an abandoned
6 vehicle to notify the registered owner and any person having a security interest in
7 the vehicle by registered or certified mail that the vehicle has been removed and
8 will be junked, dismantled or otherwise disposed of unless the owner or the person
9 having the security interest responds and pays the costs of removal. (NRS 487.250)
10 Existing law additionally requires a tow operator to notify the registered and legal
11 owner of a vehicle if the vehicle was towed and placed in storage at the request of
12 someone other than the owner or the owner’s authorized agent. (NRS 706.4479)
13 Existing law authorizes the Department of Motor Vehicles to issue a junk
14 certificate to a tow operator or automobile wrecker for a vehicle that: (1) has been
15 discarded or abandoned; (2) has been ruined, wrecked, dismantled or rendered
16 inoperative; (3) is unfit for further use in accordance with the vehicle’s original
-

17 purpose; (4) is unregistered or is not reclaimed by the registered owner or person
18 having a security interest in the vehicle within a certain period of time; and (5) has
19 value principally as scrap which does not exceed $200. (NRS 487.260) Section 4 of
20 this bill increases the value of a vehicle for which a junk certificate may be issued
21 to include a vehicle which has value principally as scrap which does not exceed
22 $500. Sections 1 and 2 of this bill authorize certain persons, with respect to an
23 abandoned, unregistered vehicle which appears likely to be appraised as a junk
24 vehicle and for which the identity of the owner is not known or readily
25 ascertainable, to affix to the vehicle a notice that if the abandoned vehicle is not
26 removed from the public or private property within 5 days, the vehicle is subject to
27 being junked, dismantled or otherwise disposed of. If this notice is affixed to an
28 unregistered vehicle which is appraised as a junk vehicle, sections 1-5 of this bill
29 excuse the person or law enforcement agency that authorized the removal of the
30 vehicle and the tow operator who removed the vehicle from other provisions
31 requiring such persons to make inquiries into the identity of the owner of the
32 vehicle and provide the owner with certain notice regarding the removal of the
33 vehicle. Section 4 requires the person or law enforcement agency that authorized
34 the removal of the vehicle to provide the contact information of the automobile
35 wrecker or tow operator who removed the vehicle if contacted by the vehicle’s
36 owner. Section 4 authorizes an automobile wrecker or tow operator who receives a
37 junk certificate for an abandoned vehicle to which such a notice has been affixed to
38 dispose of the vehicle not earlier than 48 hours after the vehicle arrives and is
39 registered at the place of storage.
40 Existing law prohibits a law enforcement agency that maintains and uses a list
41 of tow cars which are called by that agency to provide towing from including an
42 operator of a tow car on that list unless the operator meets certain requirements.
43 (NRS 706.4485) Section 6 of this bill prohibits an operator of a tow car from using
44 any software, device or other means to falsely report the location of the operator or
45 tow car to a law enforcement agency for the purpose of securing a request from the
46 law enforcement agency to provide towing services.

26 currently registered to the owner pursuant to chapter 482 of NRS.
27 For the purposes of this subsection, the determination of the
28 sheriff’s office or other law enforcement agency that notified the
29 Department pursuant to paragraph (b) of subsection 1 is conclusive
30 as to whether the abandoned vehicle was removed within the 30-day
31 period.

33 subsection 4, the Department shall reinstate the registration upon
34 receipt from the registered owner of the vehicle of:

15 enforcement agency shall, insofar as practicable and authorized by
16 law, inform the person or entity making such notification of the
17 actions taken by the sheriff’s office or other law enforcement
18 agency pursuant to this section.
19 8. As used in this section, “junk vehicle” has the meaning
20 ascribed to it in NRS 487.260.
21 Sec. 3. NRS 487.250 is hereby amended to read as follows:
