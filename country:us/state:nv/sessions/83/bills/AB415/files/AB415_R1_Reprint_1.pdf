SUMMARY—Revises provisions governing the towing of motor

FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to motor vehicles; revising provisions governing
the disposition of certain vehicles abandoned on public or
private property; revising provisions governing the
issuance of junk certificates by the Department of Motor
Vehicles; revising provisions governing lists of operators
of tow cars used by law enforcement agencies; prohibiting
the operator of a tow car from falsely reporting the
location of the operator or tow car to a law enforcement
agency for certain purposes; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law: (1) authorizes certain persons and law enforcement agencies to
2 request the removal of a vehicle that has been abandoned on public or private
3 property; and (2) requires the person who requests such a removal to inquire into
4 whether the vehicle was stolen and the identity of the vehicle’s owner. (NRS
5 487.230, 487.235) Existing law requires a person who removed an abandoned
6 vehicle to notify the registered owner and any person having a security interest in
7 the vehicle by registered or certified mail that the vehicle has been removed and
8 will be junked, dismantled or otherwise disposed of unless the owner or the person
9 having the security interest responds and pays the costs of removal. (NRS 487.250)
10 Existing law additionally requires a tow operator to notify the registered and legal
11 owner of a vehicle if the vehicle was towed and placed in storage at the request of
12 someone other than the owner or the owner’s authorized agent. (NRS 706.4479)

*AB415_R1*

– 2 –
13 Existing law authorizes the Department of Motor Vehicles to issue a junk
14 certificate to a tow operator or automobile wrecker for a vehicle that: (1) has been
15 discarded or abandoned; (2) has been ruined, wrecked, dismantled or rendered
16 inoperative; (3) is unfit for further use in accordance with the vehicle’s original
17 purpose; (4) is unregistered or is not reclaimed by the registered owner or person
18 having a security interest in the vehicle within a certain period of time; and (5) has
19 value principally as scrap which does not exceed $200. (NRS 487.260) Section 4 of
20 this bill increases the value of a vehicle for which a junk certificate may be issued
21 to include a vehicle which has value principally as scrap which does not exceed
22 $500. Section 4 authorizes the Department to issue a junk certificate for a vehicle
23 that is appraised as a junk vehicle by an automobile wrecker or tow operator in
24 accordance with regulations prescribed by the Department. Sections 1 and 2 of this
25 bill authorize certain persons, with respect to an abandoned, unregistered vehicle
26 which appears likely to be appraised as a junk vehicle and for which the identity of
27 the owner is not known or readily ascertainable, to affix to the vehicle a notice that
28 if the abandoned vehicle is not removed from the public or private property within
29 7 days, the vehicle is subject to being junked, dismantled or otherwise disposed of.
30 Sections 1 and 2 require the notice to include certain information, including that
31 the owner of the vehicle may request an expedited hearing in the local justice court
32 to contest the classification of the vehicle as an abandoned junk vehicle. If the
33 notice is affixed to certain unregistered vehicles which are appraised as junk
34 vehicles, sections 1-5 of this bill excuse the person or law enforcement agency that
35 authorized the removal of the vehicle and the tow operator who removed the
36 vehicle from other provisions requiring such persons to make inquiries into the
37 identity of the owner of the vehicle and provide the owner with certain notice
38 regarding the removal of the vehicle. Section 4 requires the person or law
39 enforcement agency that authorized the removal of the vehicle to provide the
40 contact information of the automobile wrecker or tow operator who removed the
41 vehicle if contacted by the vehicle’s owner.
42 Existing law prohibits a law enforcement agency that maintains and uses a list
43 of tow cars which are called by that agency to provide towing from including an
44 operator of a tow car on that list unless the operator meets certain requirements.
45 Existing law prohibits the Nevada Highway Patrol from removing an operator of a
46 tow car from the list used by the Nevada Highway Patrol solely on the ground that
47 the operator is insured under the same policy of insurance as one other operator of a
48 tow car who is included on the list and operates in the same geographical area.
49 (NRS 706.4485)
50 Section 6 of this bill: (1) expands the applicability of this prohibition to all law
51 enforcement agencies; and (2) prohibits an operator of a tow car from using any
52 software, device or other means to falsely report the location of the operator or tow
53 car to a law enforcement agency or any agent of a law enforcement agency for the
54 purpose of securing a request from the law enforcement agency to provide towing
55 services. Section 6 requires a law enforcement agency to remove an operator of a
56 tow car from the list used by the law enforcement agency for 1 year if the operator
57 violates that prohibition.
