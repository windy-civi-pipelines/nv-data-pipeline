AN ACT relating to public works; creating a program to gather data
on the use of job order contracts for certain public works;
authorizing certain public bodies to enter into job order
contracts for minor construction performed on an existing
public work; prescribing the procedure for awarding a job
order contract; making certain documents and other
information submitted by a person seeking a job order
contract confidential until a contract is awarded;
prescribing responsibilities of a contractor who enters into
a job order contract; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prescribes general procedures for awarding a contract for a public
2 work. (Chapter 338 of NRS) Existing law also authorizes a local government to
3 comply with alternative procedures for awarding a contract for a public work. (NRS
4 338.1373) Senate Bill No. 67 of the 2021 Legislative Session established a pilot
5 program to gather data on the use of job order contracts for certain public works in
6 Clark County, the City of Henderson, the City of Las Vegas, the City of North Las
7 Vegas and the Clark County Water Reclamation District and authorized those
8 public bodies, as part of the pilot program, to enter into job order contracts for the
9 maintenance, repair, alteration, demolition, renovation, remediation or minor
10 construction of a public work. (Chapter 523, Statutes of Nevada 2021, at page
11 3509) The pilot program expires on June 30, 2025. (Section 15 of chapter 523,
12 Statutes of Nevada 2021, at page 3514) Sections 2-16 of this bill: (1) establish a
13 similar, permanent program; (2) authorize certain public bodies to award job order
-
*AB43_R1*
– 2 –
14 contracts for certain public works; and (3) set forth various requirements and
15 restrictions concerning the use of job order contracts by those public bodies.
16 Section 2 provides that the provisions of sections 2-16 apply only to a public body
17 that is: (1) a county whose population is 700,000 or more (currently only Clark
18 County); (2) a city whose population is 150,000 or more located in such a county
19 (currently the Cities of Henderson, Las Vegas and North Las Vegas); or (3) a
20 general improvement district located in such a county which is granted certain
21 powers relating to sanitary sewer systems. (NRS 318.140)
22 Section 3 establishes a program to gather data on the use of job order contracts
23 for certain public works and directs each public body to gather and report data on
24 the use of job order contracts. Sections 5-8 define certain terms for the purposes of
25 this bill. Section 9 authorizes a public body to award job order contracts for minor
26 construction performed on an existing public work. Section 17 of this bill revises
27 the list of procedures by which a local government may award a contract for a
28 public work to include the use of job order contracts if the local government is a
29 public body to which the provisions of sections 2-16 apply pursuant to section 2.
30 Section 9 requires a job order contract to be for a fixed period and provide for
31 indefinite types and quantities of work and delivery times. Section 9 provides that a
32 job order contract: (1) must not be for work exclusive to one trade for which a
33 license as a specialty contractor is required; and (2) must require a contractor to
34 prepare and submit a proposal for each job order. Section 9 requires such a
35 proposal to include the proposed price for the job order, each construction task
36 required to perform the job order, the unit price for each such task and the
37 adjustment factor applicable to the performance of the task. Section 9 also requires
38 a public body, after holding a public hearing on the matter, to adopt a written policy
39 for the assignment of job orders and limits the total dollar amount of job order
40 contracts that may be awarded annually by each public body.
41 Section 10 prescribes the qualifications a contractor who wishes to enter into a
42 job order contract must meet. Section 11 requires a public body or its authorized
43 representative to advertise requests for proposals or similar solicitation documents
44 for job order contracts. Section 11 also prescribes: (1) the contents of such
45 advertisements or similar solicitation documents; and (2) requirements for
46 proposals. Sections 12 and 18 of this bill make any document or other information
47 submitted to a public body in response to a request for proposals or similar
48 solicitation document for a job order contract confidential and prohibit disclosure of
49 any such document or information until notice of intent to award the contract is
50 issued.
51 Section 13 prescribes the method for selecting a contractor for a job order
52 contract. Specifically, section 13 requires a public body or its authorized
53 representative to appoint a panel to rank the proposals submitted in response to the
54 request for proposals and award a job order contract to one or more applicants.
55 Section 14 prescribes certain responsibilities of a contractor who enters into a
56 job order contract relating to contracting for the services of a subcontractor,
57 supplier or professional. Section 14 also prohibits a contractor who enters into a job
58 order contract from performing more than 50 percent of the estimated cost of a
59 work order himself or herself, or using his or her own employees.
60 Section 9 requires a job order contract to provide for the use of job orders,
61 which are defined in section 7 as an order issued for a definite scope of work to be
62 performed for a fixed price pursuant to a job order contract. Section 15 requires a
63 contractor to submit a list of each subcontractor whom the contractor intends to
64 engage before a public body issues a job order. Section 16 requires a public body to
65 submit a quarterly report that contains certain information relating to job order
66 contracts to the governing body of the public body. Section 16 also requires a
67 governing body to annually submit to the Director of the Legislative Counsel
-

69 during the immediately preceding calendar year.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN

6 1. A county whose population is 700,000 or more;
7 2. A city whose population is 150,000 or more located in a
8 county whose population is 700,000 or more; or

14 contracting and bidding procedures for public works in this State
15 are efficient and cost-effective.
16 (b) The procedures for awarding a contract for a public work
17 authorized by existing law may create barriers to the efficient and
18 cost-effective awarding of contracts for minor construction
19 performed on an existing public work.
20 (c) Reducing any such barriers will benefit the public and
21 promote the timely completion of certain public works projects
22 that are critical for the health and safety of members of the public
23 who use public buildings and facilities.
24 (d) The voluminous and unpredictable amount of work for
25 which certain public bodies in large counties in this State must
26 award contracts presents unique challenges for these bodies.
27 (e) The use of job order contracting eliminates certain
28 administrative burdens associated with traditional procurement
29 methods and enables such a public body to efficiently manage the
30 numerous minor construction projects required for existing
31 facilities.
32 (f) The provisions of sections 2 to 16, inclusive, of this act are
33 not intended to prohibit a public body from awarding a contract
34 for a public work pursuant to any other procedure authorized

36 2. The Legislature therefore:
37 (a) Establishes a program to gather data on the use of job

37 2. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3, a public body

1 3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a
2 public book or record shall not deny a request made pursuant to
3 subsection 1 to inspect or copy or receive a copy of a public book or
4 record on the basis that the requested public book or record contains
5 information that is confidential if the governmental entity can
6 redact, delete, conceal or separate, including, without limitation,
7 electronically, the confidential information from the information
8 included in the public book or record that is not otherwise
9 confidential.
10 4. If requested, a governmental entity shall provide a copy of a
11 public record in an electronic format by means of an electronic
12 medium. Nothing in this subsection requires a governmental entity
13 to provide a copy of a public record in an electronic format or by
14 means of an electronic medium if:
15 (a) The public record:
16 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
17 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
18 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by
19 means of an electronic medium would:
20 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
21 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential
22 and that cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from
23 information that is not otherwise confidential.
24 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who
25 has legal custody or control of a public record:
26 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the
27 medium that is requested because the officer, employee or agent has
28 already prepared or would prefer to provide the copy in a different
29 medium.
30 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon
31 request, prepare the copy of the public record and shall not require
32 the person who has requested the copy to prepare the copy himself
33 or herself.
34 Sec. 19. The provisions of subsection 1 of NRS 218D.380 do
35 not apply to any provision of this act which adds or revises a
36 requirement to submit a report to the Legislature.
37 Sec. 20. This act becomes effective on July 1, 2025.

1 Existing law prescribes general procedures for awarding a contract for a public
2 work. (Chapter 338 of NRS) Existing law also authorizes a local government to
3 comply with alternative procedures for awarding a contract for a public work. (NRS
4 338.1373) Senate Bill No. 67 of the 2021 Legislative Session established a pilot
5 program to gather data on the use of job order contracts for certain public works in
6 Clark County, the City of Henderson, the City of Las Vegas, the City of North Las
7 Vegas and the Clark County Water Reclamation District and authorized those
8 public bodies, as part of the pilot program, to enter into job order contracts for the
9 maintenance, repair, alteration, demolition, renovation, remediation or minor
10 construction of a public work. (Chapter 523, Statutes of Nevada 2021, at page
11 3509) The pilot program expires on June 30, 2025. (Section 15 of chapter 523,
12 Statutes of Nevada 2021, at page 3514) Sections 2-16 of this bill: (1) establish a
13 similar, permanent program; (2) authorize certain public bodies to award job order
-
*AB43_R1*

– 2 –
14 contracts for certain public works; and (3) set forth various requirements and
15 restrictions concerning the use of job order contracts by those public bodies.
16 Section 2 provides that the provisions of sections 2-16 apply only to a public body
17 that is: (1) a county whose population is 700,000 or more (currently only Clark
18 County); (2) a city whose population is 150,000 or more located in such a county
19 (currently the Cities of Henderson, Las Vegas and North Las Vegas); or (3) a
20 general improvement district located in such a county which is granted certain
21 powers relating to sanitary sewer systems. (NRS 318.140)
22 Section 3 establishes a program to gather data on the use of job order contracts
23 for certain public works and directs each public body to gather and report data on
24 the use of job order contracts. Sections 5-8 define certain terms for the purposes of
25 this bill. Section 9 authorizes a public body to award job order contracts for minor
26 construction performed on an existing public work. Section 17 of this bill revises
27 the list of procedures by which a local government may award a contract for a
28 public work to include the use of job order contracts if the local government is a
29 public body to which the provisions of sections 2-16 apply pursuant to section 2.
30 Section 9 requires a job order contract to be for a fixed period and provide for
31 indefinite types and quantities of work and delivery times. Section 9 provides that a
32 job order contract: (1) must not be for work exclusive to one trade for which a
33 license as a specialty contractor is required; and (2) must require a contractor to
34 prepare and submit a proposal for each job order. Section 9 requires such a
35 proposal to include the proposed price for the job order, each construction task
36 required to perform the job order, the unit price for each such task and the
37 adjustment factor applicable to the performance of the task. Section 9 also requires
38 a public body, after holding a public hearing on the matter, to adopt a written policy
39 for the assignment of job orders and limits the total dollar amount of job order
40 contracts that may be awarded annually by each public body.
41 Section 10 prescribes the qualifications a contractor who wishes to enter into a
42 job order contract must meet. Section 11 requires a public body or its authorized
43 representative to advertise requests for proposals or similar solicitation documents
44 for job order contracts. Section 11 also prescribes: (1) the contents of such
45 advertisements or similar solicitation documents; and (2) requirements for
46 proposals. Sections 12 and 18 of this bill make any document or other information
47 submitted to a public body in response to a request for proposals or similar
48 solicitation document for a job order contract confidential and prohibit disclosure of
49 any such document or information until notice of intent to award the contract is
50 issued.
51 Section 13 prescribes the method for selecting a contractor for a job order
52 contract. Specifically, section 13 requires a public body or its authorized
53 representative to appoint a panel to rank the proposals submitted in response to the
54 request for proposals and award a job order contract to one or more applicants.
55 Section 14 prescribes certain responsibilities of a contractor who enters into a
56 job order contract relating to contracting for the services of a subcontractor,
57 supplier or professional. Section 14 also prohibits a contractor who enters into a job
58 order contract from performing more than 50 percent of the estimated cost of a
59 work order himself or herself, or using his or her own employees.
60 Section 9 requires a job order contract to provide for the use of job orders,
61 which are defined in section 7 as an order issued for a definite scope of work to be
62 performed for a fixed price pursuant to a job order contract. Section 15 requires a
63 contractor to submit a list of each subcontractor whom the contractor intends to
64 engage before a public body issues a job order. Section 16 requires a public body to
65 submit a quarterly report that contains certain information relating to job order
66 contracts to the governing body of the public body. Section 16 also requires a
67 governing body to annually submit to the Director of the Legislative Counsel

14 contracting and bidding procedures for public works in this State
15 are efficient and cost-effective.
16 (b) The procedures for awarding a contract for a public work
17 authorized by existing law may create barriers to the efficient and
18 cost-effective awarding of contracts for minor construction
19 performed on an existing public work.
20 (c) Reducing any such barriers will benefit the public and
21 promote the timely completion of certain public works projects
22 that are critical for the health and safety of members of the public

24 (d) The voluminous and unpredictable amount of work for
25 which certain public bodies in large counties in this State must
26 award contracts presents unique challenges for these bodies.
27 (e) The use of job order contracting eliminates certain
28 administrative burdens associated with traditional procurement
29 methods and enables such a public body to efficiently manage the
30 numerous minor construction projects required for existing
31 facilities.
32 (f) The provisions of sections 2 to 16, inclusive, of this act are
33 not intended to prohibit a public body from awarding a contract

1 3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a
2 public book or record shall not deny a request made pursuant to
3 subsection 1 to inspect or copy or receive a copy of a public book or
4 record on the basis that the requested public book or record contains
5 information that is confidential if the governmental entity can
6 redact, delete, conceal or separate, including, without limitation,
7 electronically, the confidential information from the information
8 included in the public book or record that is not otherwise
9 confidential.
10 4. If requested, a governmental entity shall provide a copy of a
11 public record in an electronic format by means of an electronic
12 medium. Nothing in this subsection requires a governmental entity
13 to provide a copy of a public record in an electronic format or by
14 means of an electronic medium if:
15 (a) The public record:
16 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
17 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
18 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by
19 means of an electronic medium would:
20 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
21 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential
22 and that cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from
23 information that is not otherwise confidential.
24 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who
25 has legal custody or control of a public record:
26 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the
27 medium that is requested because the officer, employee or agent has
28 already prepared or would prefer to provide the copy in a different
29 medium.
30 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon
31 request, prepare the copy of the public record and shall not require
32 the person who has requested the copy to prepare the copy himself
33 or herself.
34 Sec. 19. The provisions of subsection 1 of NRS 218D.380 do
35 not apply to any provision of this act which adds or revises a
36 requirement to submit a report to the Legislature.
37 Sec. 20. This act becomes effective on July 1, 2025.
