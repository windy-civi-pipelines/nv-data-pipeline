AN ACT relating to public works; creating a program to gather data on the use of
job order contracts for certain public works; authorizing certain public
bodies to enter into job order contracts for minor construction
performed on an existing public work; prescribing the procedure for
awarding a job order contract; making certain documents and other
information submitted by a person seeking a job order contract
confidential until a contract is awarded; prescribing responsibilities of
a contractor who enters into a job order contract; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prescribes general procedures for awarding a contract for a public work.
2 (Chapter 338 of NRS) Existing law also authorizes a local government to comply with
3 alternative procedures for awarding a contract for a public work. (NRS 338.1373) Senate Bill
4 No. 67 of the 2021 Legislative Session established a pilot program to gather data on the use of
5 job order contracts for certain public works in Clark County, the City of Henderson, the City
6 of Las Vegas, the City of North Las Vegas and the Clark County Water Reclamation District
7 and authorized those public bodies, as part of the pilot program, to enter into job order
8 contracts for the maintenance, repair, alteration, demolition, renovation, remediation or minor
9 construction of a public work. (Chapter 523, Statutes of Nevada 2021, at page 3509) The pilot
10 program expires on June 30, 2025. (Section 15 of chapter 523, Statutes of Nevada 2021, at
11 page 3514) Sections 2-16 of this bill: (1) establish a similar, permanent program; (2) authorize
12 certain public bodies to award job order contracts for certain public works; and (3) set forth
13 various requirements and restrictions concerning the use of job order contracts by those public
14 bodies. Section 2 provides that the provisions of sections 2-16 apply only to a public body
15 that is: (1) a county whose population is 700,000 or more (currently only Clark County); (2) a
16 city whose population is 150,000 or more located in such a county (currently the Cities of
17 Henderson, Las Vegas and North Las Vegas); or (3) a general improvement district located in
18 such a county which is granted certain powers relating to sanitary sewer systems. (NRS
19 318.140)
20 Section 3 establishes a program to gather data on the use of job order contracts for certain
21 public works and directs each public body to gather and report data on the use of job order

Senate Amendment No. 689 to Assembly Bill No. 43 First Reprint Page 4
22 contracts. Sections 5-8 define certain terms for the purposes of this bill. Section 9 authorizes a
23 public body to award job order contracts for minor construction performed on an existing
24 public work. Section 17 of this bill revises the list of procedures by which a local government
25 may award a contract for a public work to include the use of job order contracts if the local
26 government is a public body to which the provisions of sections 2-16 apply pursuant to
27 section 2.
28 Section 9 requires a job order contract to be for a fixed period and provide for indefinite
29 types and quantities of work and delivery times. Section 9 provides that a job order contract:
30 (1) must not be for work exclusive to one trade for which a license as a specialty contractor is
31 required; and (2) must require a contractor to prepare and submit a proposal for each job
32 order. Section 9 requires such a proposal to include the proposed price for the job order, each
33 construction task required to perform the job order, the unit price for each such task and the
34 adjustment factor applicable to the performance of the task. Section 9 also requires a public
35 body, after holding a public hearing on the matter, to adopt a written policy for the assignment
36 of job orders and limits the total dollar amount of job order contracts that may be awarded
37 annually by each public body.
38 Section 9.5 of this bill sets forth certain requirements for a job order contract with
39 respect to workers who perform work under contract, including the requirement that at
40 least 51 percent of such workers be enrolled in or graduates of an apprenticeship
41 program. Section 14.5 authorizes a public body to waive that requirement under certain
42 circumstances.
43 Section 10 prescribes the qualifications a contractor who wishes to enter into a job order
44 contract must meet. Section 11 requires a public body or its authorized representative to
45 advertise requests for proposals or similar solicitation documents for job order contracts.
46 Section 11 also prescribes: (1) the contents of such advertisements or similar solicitation
47 documents; and (2) requirements for proposals. Sections 12 and 18 of this bill make any
48 document or other information submitted to a public body in response to a request for
49 proposals or similar solicitation document for a job order contract confidential and prohibit
50 disclosure of any such document or information until notice of intent to award the contract is
51 issued.
52 Section 13 prescribes the method for selecting a contractor for a job order contract.
53 Specifically, section 13 requires a public body or its authorized representative to appoint a
54 panel to rank the proposals submitted in response to the request for proposals and award a job
55 order contract to one or more applicants.
56 Section 14 prescribes certain responsibilities of a contractor who enters into a job order
57 contract relating to contracting for the services of a subcontractor, supplier or professional.
58 Section 14 also prohibits a contractor who enters into a job order contract from performing
59 more than 50 percent of the estimated cost of a work order himself or herself, or using his or
60 her own employees.
61 Section 9 requires a job order contract to provide for the use of job orders, which are
62 defined in section 7 as an order issued for a definite scope of work to be performed for a fixed
63 price pursuant to a job order contract. Section 15 requires a contractor to submit a list of each
64 subcontractor whom the contractor intends to engage before a public body issues a job order.
65 Section 16 requires a public body to submit a quarterly report that contains certain
66 information relating to job order contracts to the governing body of the public body. Section
67 16 also requires a governing body to annually submit to the Director of the Legislative
68 Counsel Bureau a written report including the information reported to the governing body
69 during the immediately preceding calendar year.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

8 (a) It is in the best interest of the State to ensure that contracting and bidding
9 procedures for public works in this State are efficient and cost-effective.
10 (b) The procedures for awarding a contract for a public work authorized by
11 existing law may create barriers to the efficient and cost-effective awarding of
12 contracts for minor construction performed on an existing public work.
13 (c) Reducing any such barriers will benefit the public and promote the timely
14 completion of certain public works projects that are critical for the health and
15 safety of members of the public who use public buildings and facilities.
16 (d) The voluminous and unpredictable amount of work for which certain
17 public bodies in large counties in this State must award contracts presents unique
18 challenges for these bodies.
19 (e) The use of job order contracting eliminates certain administrative
20 burdens associated with traditional procurement methods and enables such a
21 public body to efficiently manage the numerous minor construction projects
22 required for existing facilities.
23 (f) The provisions of sections 2 to 16, inclusive, of this act are not intended to
24 prohibit a public body from awarding a contract for a public work pursuant to
25 any other procedure authorized pursuant to this chapter.
26 2. The Legislature therefore:
27 (a) Establishes a program to gather data on the use of job order contracts for
28 minor construction performed on an existing public work; and
29 (b) Directs each public body in the program to gather and report data on the
30 use of job order contracts in this State in the manner prescribed by section 16 of
31 this act.
32 Sec. 4. As used in sections 2 to 16, inclusive, of this act, unless the context

34 this act have the meanings ascribed to them in those sections.
35 Sec. 5. “Adjustment factor” means the adjustment that is multiplied by a

39 Sec. 6. “Construction task” means an item of work:
40 1. That is included in a job order; and

6 contractor is required.
7 2. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3, a public body may not
8 award more than $25,000,000 annually in job order contracts.
9 3. If the total dollar amount of all job order contracts awarded by a public
10 body in any 1 year is less than the maximum dollar amount of job order contracts
11 allowed to be awarded for that year pursuant to subsection 2, the difference
12 between those amounts may be added to the total dollar amount of job order
13 contracts that a public body may award in the immediately following year.
14 4. A public body shall, after holding a public hearing on the matter, adopt a
15 written policy for the assignment of job orders, which must include, without

1 inspection by any person, and may be fully copied or an abstract or memorandum
2 may be prepared from those public books and public records. Any such copies,
3 abstracts or memoranda may be used to supply the general public with copies,
4 abstracts or memoranda of the records or may be used in any other way to the
5 advantage of the governmental entity or of the general public. This section does not
6 supersede or in any manner affect the federal laws governing copyrights or enlarge,
7 diminish or affect in any other manner the rights of a person in any written book or
8 record which is copyrighted pursuant to federal law.
9 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record which is
10 copyrighted solely because it is copyrighted.
11 3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a public book or
12 record shall not deny a request made pursuant to subsection 1 to inspect or copy or
13 receive a copy of a public book or record on the basis that the requested public
14 book or record contains information that is confidential if the governmental entity
15 can redact, delete, conceal or separate, including, without limitation, electronically,
16 the confidential information from the information included in the public book or
17 record that is not otherwise confidential.
18 4. If requested, a governmental entity shall provide a copy of a public record
19 in an electronic format by means of an electronic medium. Nothing in this
20 subsection requires a governmental entity to provide a copy of a public record in an
21 electronic format or by means of an electronic medium if:
22 (a) The public record:
23 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
24 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
25 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by means of an
26 electronic medium would:
27 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
28 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential and that
29 cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from information that is not
30 otherwise confidential.
31 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who has legal
32 custody or control of a public record:
33 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the medium that
34 is requested because the officer, employee or agent has already prepared or would
35 prefer to provide the copy in a different medium.
36 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon request, prepare
37 the copy of the public record and shall not require the person who has requested the
38 copy to prepare the copy himself or herself.
39 Sec. 19. The provisions of subsection 1 of NRS 218D.380 do not apply to
40 any provision of this act which adds or revises a requirement to submit a report to
41 the Legislature.
42 Sec. 20. This act becomes effective on July 1, 2025.
