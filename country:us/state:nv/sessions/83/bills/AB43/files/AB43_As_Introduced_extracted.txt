AN ACT relating to public works; creating a program to gather data
on the use of job order contracts for certain public works;
authorizing certain public bodies to enter into job order
contracts for the maintenance, repair, alteration,
demolition, renovation, remediation or minor construction
of a public work; prescribing the procedure for awarding
a job order contract; making certain documents and other
information submitted by a person seeking a job order

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prescribes general procedures for awarding a contract for a public
2 work. (Chapter 338 of NRS) Existing law also authorizes a local government to
3 comply with alternative procedures for awarding a contract for a public work. (NRS
4 338.1373) Senate Bill No. 67 of the 2021 Legislative Session established a pilot
5 program to gather data on the use of job order contracts for certain public works in
6 Clark County, the City of Henderson, the City of Las Vegas, the City of North Las
7 Vegas and the Clark County Water Reclamation District and authorized those
8 public bodies, as part of the pilot program, to enter into job order contracts for the
9 maintenance, repair, alteration, demolition, renovation, remediation or minor
10 construction of a public work. (Chapter 523, Statutes of Nevada 2021, at page
11 3509) The pilot program expires on June 30, 2025. (Section 15 of chapter 523,
12 Statutes of Nevada 2021, at page 3514) Sections 2-16 of this bill: (1) establish a
-
*AB43*
– 2 –
13 similar, permanent program; (2) authorize certain public bodies to award job order
14 contracts for certain public works; and (3) set forth various requirements and
15 restrictions concerning the use of job order contracts by those public bodies.
16 Section 2 provides that the provisions of sections 2-16 apply only to a public body
17 that is: (1) a county whose population is 700,000 or more (currently only Clark
18 County); (2) a city whose population is 150,000 or more located in such a county
19 (currently the Cities of Henderson, Las Vegas and North Las Vegas); or (3) a
20 general improvement district located in such a county which is granted certain
21 powers relating to sanitary sewer systems. (NRS 318.140)
22 Section 3 establishes a program to gather data on the use of job order contracts
23 for certain public works and directs each public body to gather and report data on
24 the use of job order contracts. Sections 5-8 define certain terms for the purposes of
25 this bill. Section 9 authorizes a public body to award job order contracts for the
26 maintenance, repair, alteration, demolition, renovation, remediation or minor
27 construction of public works. Section 17 of this bill revises the list of procedures by
28 which a local government may award a contract for a public work to include the use
29 of job order contracts if the local government is a public body to which the
30 provisions of sections 2-16 apply pursuant to section 2.
31 Section 9 requires a job order contract to be for a fixed period and provide for
32 indefinite types and quantities of work and delivery times. Section 9 provides that a
33 job order contract: (1) must not be for work exclusive to one trade for which a
34 license as a specialty contractor is required; and (2) must require a contractor to
35 prepare and submit a proposal for each job order. Section 9 requires such a
36 proposal to include the proposed price for the job order, each construction task
37 required to perform the job order, the unit price for each such task and the
38 adjustment factor applicable to the performance of the task. Section 9 also requires
39 a public body to adopt a written policy for the assignment of job orders and limits
40 the total dollar amount of job order contracts that may be awarded annually by each
41 public body.
42 Section 10 prescribes the qualifications a contractor who wishes to enter into a
43 job order contract must meet. Section 11 requires a public body or its authorized
44 representative to advertise requests for proposals or similar solicitation documents
45 for job order contracts. Section 11 also prescribes: (1) the contents of such
46 advertisements or similar solicitation documents; and (2) requirements for
47 proposals. Sections 12 and 18 of this bill make any document or other information
48 submitted to a public body in response to a request for proposals or similar
49 solicitation document for a job order contract confidential and prohibit disclosure of
50 any such document or information until notice of intent to award the contract is
51 issued.
52 Section 13 prescribes the method for selecting a contractor for a job order
53 contract. Specifically, section 13 requires a public body or its authorized
54 representative to appoint a panel to rank the proposals submitted in response to the
55 request for proposals and award a job order contract to one or more applicants.
56 Section 14 prescribes certain responsibilities of a contractor who enters into a
57 job order contract relating to contracting for the services of a subcontractor,
58 supplier or professional. Section 14 also prohibits a contractor who enters into a job
59 order contract from performing more than 50 percent of the estimated cost of a
60 work order himself or herself, or using his or her own employees.
61 Section 9 requires a job order contract to provide for the use of job orders,
62 which are defined in section 7 as an order issued for a definite scope of work to be
63 performed for a fixed price pursuant to a job order contract. Section 15 requires a
64 contractor to submit a list of each subcontractor whom the contractor intends to
65 engage before a public body issues a job order. Section 16 requires a public body to
66 submit a quarterly report that contains certain information relating to job order
67 contracts to the governing body of the public body. Section 16 also requires a
-
*AB43*
– 3 –
68 governing body to annually submit to the Director of the Legislative Counsel
69 Bureau a written report including the information reported to the governing body
70 during the immediately preceding calendar year.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 338 of NRS is hereby amended by adding
2 thereto the provisions set forth as sections 2 to 16, inclusive, of this

6 1. A county whose population is 700,000 or more;
7 2. A city whose population is 150,000 or more located in a
8 county whose population is 700,000 or more; or
9 3. A general improvement district established pursuant to
10 chapter 318 of NRS in a county whose population is 700,000 or
11 more which is granted the powers set forth in NRS 318.140.

14 contracting and bidding procedures for public works in this State
15 are efficient and cost-effective.
16 (b) The procedures for awarding a contract for a public work
17 authorized by existing law may create barriers to the efficient and
18 cost-effective awarding of contracts for the maintenance, repair,
19 alteration, demolition, renovation, remediation or minor
20 construction of a public work.
21 (c) Reducing any such barriers will benefit the public and
22 promote the timely completion of certain public works projects
23 that are critical for the health and safety of members of the public
24 who use public buildings and facilities.
25 (d) The voluminous and unpredictable amount of work for
26 which certain public bodies in large counties in this State must
27 award contracts presents unique challenges for these bodies.
28 (e) The use of job order contracting eliminates certain
29 administrative burdens associated with traditional procurement
30 methods and enables such a public body to efficiently manage the
31 numerous renovation, repair and maintenance projects required
32 for facilities.
33 (f) The provisions of sections 2 to 16, inclusive, of this act are
34 not intended to prohibit a public body from awarding a contract
35 for a public work pursuant to any other procedure authorized
36 pursuant to this chapter.
37 2. The Legislature therefore:

1 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record
2 which is copyrighted solely because it is copyrighted.
3 3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a
4 public book or record shall not deny a request made pursuant to
5 subsection 1 to inspect or copy or receive a copy of a public book or
6 record on the basis that the requested public book or record contains
7 information that is confidential if the governmental entity can

18 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
19 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
20 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by

24 and that cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from
25 information that is not otherwise confidential.
26 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who
27 has legal custody or control of a public record:

33 request, prepare the copy of the public record and shall not require

6 Clark County, the City of Henderson, the City of Las Vegas, the City of North Las
7 Vegas and the Clark County Water Reclamation District and authorized those
8 public bodies, as part of the pilot program, to enter into job order contracts for the
9 maintenance, repair, alteration, demolition, renovation, remediation or minor
10 construction of a public work. (Chapter 523, Statutes of Nevada 2021, at page
11 3509) The pilot program expires on June 30, 2025. (Section 15 of chapter 523,
12 Statutes of Nevada 2021, at page 3514) Sections 2-16 of this bill: (1) establish a
-

– 2 –
13 similar, permanent program; (2) authorize certain public bodies to award job order
14 contracts for certain public works; and (3) set forth various requirements and
15 restrictions concerning the use of job order contracts by those public bodies.
16 Section 2 provides that the provisions of sections 2-16 apply only to a public body
17 that is: (1) a county whose population is 700,000 or more (currently only Clark
18 County); (2) a city whose population is 150,000 or more located in such a county
19 (currently the Cities of Henderson, Las Vegas and North Las Vegas); or (3) a
20 general improvement district located in such a county which is granted certain

22 Section 3 establishes a program to gather data on the use of job order contracts
23 for certain public works and directs each public body to gather and report data on
24 the use of job order contracts. Sections 5-8 define certain terms for the purposes of
25 this bill. Section 9 authorizes a public body to award job order contracts for the
26 maintenance, repair, alteration, demolition, renovation, remediation or minor
27 construction of public works. Section 17 of this bill revises the list of procedures by
28 which a local government may award a contract for a public work to include the use
29 of job order contracts if the local government is a public body to which the
30 provisions of sections 2-16 apply pursuant to section 2.
31 Section 9 requires a job order contract to be for a fixed period and provide for
32 indefinite types and quantities of work and delivery times. Section 9 provides that a
33 job order contract: (1) must not be for work exclusive to one trade for which a
34 license as a specialty contractor is required; and (2) must require a contractor to
35 prepare and submit a proposal for each job order. Section 9 requires such a
36 proposal to include the proposed price for the job order, each construction task
37 required to perform the job order, the unit price for each such task and the
38 adjustment factor applicable to the performance of the task. Section 9 also requires
39 a public body to adopt a written policy for the assignment of job orders and limits
40 the total dollar amount of job order contracts that may be awarded annually by each
41 public body.
42 Section 10 prescribes the qualifications a contractor who wishes to enter into a
43 job order contract must meet. Section 11 requires a public body or its authorized
44 representative to advertise requests for proposals or similar solicitation documents
45 for job order contracts. Section 11 also prescribes: (1) the contents of such
46 advertisements or similar solicitation documents; and (2) requirements for
47 proposals. Sections 12 and 18 of this bill make any document or other information
48 submitted to a public body in response to a request for proposals or similar
49 solicitation document for a job order contract confidential and prohibit disclosure of
50 any such document or information until notice of intent to award the contract is
51 issued.
52 Section 13 prescribes the method for selecting a contractor for a job order
53 contract. Specifically, section 13 requires a public body or its authorized
54 representative to appoint a panel to rank the proposals submitted in response to the
55 request for proposals and award a job order contract to one or more applicants.
56 Section 14 prescribes certain responsibilities of a contractor who enters into a
57 job order contract relating to contracting for the services of a subcontractor,
58 supplier or professional. Section 14 also prohibits a contractor who enters into a job
59 order contract from performing more than 50 percent of the estimated cost of a
60 work order himself or herself, or using his or her own employees.
61 Section 9 requires a job order contract to provide for the use of job orders,
62 which are defined in section 7 as an order issued for a definite scope of work to be
63 performed for a fixed price pursuant to a job order contract. Section 15 requires a
64 contractor to submit a list of each subcontractor whom the contractor intends to
65 engage before a public body issues a job order. Section 16 requires a public body to
66 submit a quarterly report that contains certain information relating to job order
67 contracts to the governing body of the public body. Section 16 also requires a
-

69 Bureau a written report including the information reported to the governing body
70 during the immediately preceding calendar year.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN

6 1. A county whose population is 700,000 or more;
7 2. A city whose population is 150,000 or more located in a
8 county whose population is 700,000 or more; or
9 3. A general improvement district established pursuant to

14 contracting and bidding procedures for public works in this State
15 are efficient and cost-effective.
16 (b) The procedures for awarding a contract for a public work
17 authorized by existing law may create barriers to the efficient and
18 cost-effective awarding of contracts for the maintenance, repair,
19 alteration, demolition, renovation, remediation or minor
20 construction of a public work.
21 (c) Reducing any such barriers will benefit the public and
22 promote the timely completion of certain public works projects
23 that are critical for the health and safety of members of the public
24 who use public buildings and facilities.
25 (d) The voluminous and unpredictable amount of work for
26 which certain public bodies in large counties in this State must
27 award contracts presents unique challenges for these bodies.
28 (e) The use of job order contracting eliminates certain
29 administrative burdens associated with traditional procurement
30 methods and enables such a public body to efficiently manage the
31 numerous renovation, repair and maintenance projects required
32 for facilities.
33 (f) The provisions of sections 2 to 16, inclusive, of this act are
34 not intended to prohibit a public body from awarding a contract

1 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record
2 which is copyrighted solely because it is copyrighted.
3 3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a
4 public book or record shall not deny a request made pursuant to
5 subsection 1 to inspect or copy or receive a copy of a public book or
6 record on the basis that the requested public book or record contains
7 information that is confidential if the governmental entity can
8 redact, delete, conceal or separate, including, without limitation,
9 electronically, the confidential information from the information
10 included in the public book or record that is not otherwise
11 confidential.
12 4. If requested, a governmental entity shall provide a copy of a
13 public record in an electronic format by means of an electronic
14 medium. Nothing in this subsection requires a governmental entity
15 to provide a copy of a public record in an electronic format or by
16 means of an electronic medium if:
17 (a) The public record:
18 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
19 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
20 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by
21 means of an electronic medium would:
22 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
23 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential
24 and that cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from
25 information that is not otherwise confidential.
26 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who
27 has legal custody or control of a public record:
28 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the
29 medium that is requested because the officer, employee or agent has
30 already prepared or would prefer to provide the copy in a different
31 medium.
32 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon
33 request, prepare the copy of the public record and shall not require
34 the person who has requested the copy to prepare the copy himself
35 or herself.
36 Sec. 19. The provisions of subsection 1 of NRS 218D.380 do
37 not apply to any provision of this act which adds or revises a
38 requirement to submit a report to the Legislature.
39 Sec. 20. This act becomes effective on July 1, 2025.
