on the use of job order contracts for certain public works;
authorizing certain public bodies to enter into job order

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prescribes general procedures for awarding a contract for a public
2 work. (Chapter 338 of NRS) Existing law also authorizes a local government to
3 comply with alternative procedures for awarding a contract for a public work. (NRS
4 338.1373) Senate Bill No. 67 of the 2021 Legislative Session established a pilot
5 program to gather data on the use of job order contracts for certain public works in
6 Clark County, the City of Henderson, the City of Las Vegas, the City of North Las
7 Vegas and the Clark County Water Reclamation District and authorized those
8 public bodies, as part of the pilot program, to enter into job order contracts for the
9 maintenance, repair, alteration, demolition, renovation, remediation or minor
10 construction of a public work. (Chapter 523, Statutes of Nevada 2021, at page
11 3509) The pilot program expires on June 30, 2025. (Section 15 of chapter 523,
12 Statutes of Nevada 2021, at page 3514) Sections 2-16 of this bill: (1) establish a
13 similar, permanent program; (2) authorize certain public bodies to award job order
-
*AB43_R3*

– 2 –
14 contracts for certain public works; and (3) set forth various requirements and
15 restrictions concerning the use of job order contracts by those public bodies.
16 Section 2 provides that the provisions of sections 2-16 apply only to a public body
17 that is: (1) a county whose population is 700,000 or more (currently only Clark
18 County); (2) a city whose population is 150,000 or more located in such a county
19 (currently the Cities of Henderson, Las Vegas and North Las Vegas); or (3) a
20 general improvement district located in such a county which is granted certain
21 powers relating to sanitary sewer systems. (NRS 318.140)
22 Section 3 establishes a program to gather data on the use of job order contracts
23 for certain public works and directs each public body to gather and report data on
24 the use of job order contracts. Sections 5-8 define certain terms for the purposes of
25 this bill. Section 9 authorizes a public body to award job order contracts for minor
26 construction performed on an existing public work. Section 17 of this bill revises
27 the list of procedures by which a local government may award a contract for a
28 public work to include the use of job order contracts if the local government is a
29 public body to which the provisions of sections 2-16 apply pursuant to section 2.
30 Section 9 requires a job order contract to be for a fixed period and provide for
31 indefinite types and quantities of work and delivery times. Section 9 provides that a
32 job order contract: (1) must not be for work exclusive to one trade for which a
33 license as a specialty contractor is required; and (2) must require a contractor to
34 prepare and submit a proposal for each job order. Section 9 requires such a
35 proposal to include the proposed price for the job order, each construction task
36 required to perform the job order, the unit price for each such task and the
37 adjustment factor applicable to the performance of the task. Section 9 also requires
38 a public body, after holding a public hearing on the matter, to adopt a written policy
39 for the assignment of job orders and limits the total dollar amount of job order
40 contracts that may be awarded annually by each public body.
41 Section 9.5 of this bill sets forth certain requirements for a job order contract
42 with respect to workers who perform work under contract, including the
43 requirement that at least 25 percent of such workers be enrolled in or graduates of
44 an apprenticeship program. Section 14.5 authorizes a public body to waive that
45 requirement under certain circumstances.
46 Section 10 prescribes the qualifications a contractor who wishes to enter into a
47 job order contract must meet. Section 11 requires a public body or its authorized
48 representative to advertise requests for proposals or similar solicitation documents
49 for job order contracts. Section 11 also prescribes: (1) the contents of such
50 advertisements or similar solicitation documents; and (2) requirements for
51 proposals. Sections 12 and 18 of this bill make any document or other information
52 submitted to a public body in response to a request for proposals or similar
53 solicitation document for a job order contract confidential and prohibit disclosure of
54 any such document or information until notice of intent to award the contract is
55 issued.
56 Section 13 prescribes the method for selecting a contractor for a job order
57 contract. Specifically, section 13 requires a public body or its authorized
58 representative to appoint a panel to rank the proposals submitted in response to the
59 request for proposals and award a job order contract to one or more applicants.
60 Section 14 prescribes certain responsibilities of a contractor who enters into a
61 job order contract relating to contracting for the services of a subcontractor,
62 supplier or professional. Section 14 also prohibits a contractor who enters into a job
63 order contract from performing more than 50 percent of the estimated cost of a
64 work order himself or herself, or using his or her own employees.
65 Section 9 requires a job order contract to provide for the use of job orders,
66 which are defined in section 7 as an order issued for a definite scope of work to be
67 performed for a fixed price pursuant to a job order contract. Section 15 requires a
68 contractor to submit a list of each subcontractor whom the contractor intends to
-

– 3 –
69 engage before a public body issues a job order. Section 16 requires a public body to
70 submit a quarterly report that contains certain information relating to job order
71 contracts to the governing body of the public body. Section 16 also requires a
72 governing body to annually submit to the Director of the Legislative Counsel
73 Bureau a written report including the information reported to the governing body
74 during the immediately preceding calendar year.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN

17 authorized by existing law may create barriers to the efficient and
18 cost-effective awarding of contracts for minor construction
19 performed on an existing public work.

21 promote the timely completion of certain public works projects
22 that are critical for the health and safety of members of the public

24 (d) The voluminous and unpredictable amount of work for
25 which certain public bodies in large counties in this State must
26 award contracts presents unique challenges for these bodies.

29 methods and enables such a public body to efficiently manage the
30 numerous minor construction projects required for existing
31 facilities.
32 (f) The provisions of sections 2 to 16, inclusive, of this act are
33 not intended to prohibit a public body from awarding a contract

5 711.600, and section 12 of this act, sections 35, 38 and 41 of
6 chapter 478, Statutes of Nevada 2011 and section 2 of chapter 391,
7 Statutes of Nevada 2013 and unless otherwise declared by law to be
8 confidential, all public books and public records of a governmental
9 entity must be open at all times during office hours to inspection by
10 any person, and may be fully copied or an abstract or memorandum
11 may be prepared from those public books and public records. Any
12 such copies, abstracts or memoranda may be used to supply the
13 general public with copies, abstracts or memoranda of the records or
14 may be used in any other way to the advantage of the governmental
15 entity or of the general public. This section does not supersede or in
16 any manner affect the federal laws governing copyrights or enlarge,
17 diminish or affect in any other manner the rights of a person in any
18 written book or record which is copyrighted pursuant to federal law.
19 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record
20 which is copyrighted solely because it is copyrighted.
21 3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a
22 public book or record shall not deny a request made pursuant to
23 subsection 1 to inspect or copy or receive a copy of a public book or
24 record on the basis that the requested public book or record contains
25 information that is confidential if the governmental entity can
26 redact, delete, conceal or separate, including, without limitation,
27 electronically, the confidential information from the information
28 included in the public book or record that is not otherwise
29 confidential.
30 4. If requested, a governmental entity shall provide a copy of a
31 public record in an electronic format by means of an electronic
32 medium. Nothing in this subsection requires a governmental entity
33 to provide a copy of a public record in an electronic format or by
34 means of an electronic medium if:
35 (a) The public record:
36 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
37 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
38 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by
39 means of an electronic medium would:
40 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
41 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential
42 and that cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from
43 information that is not otherwise confidential.
44 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who
45 has legal custody or control of a public record:
-
*AB43_R3*

– 14 –
1 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the
2 medium that is requested because the officer, employee or agent has
3 already prepared or would prefer to provide the copy in a different
4 medium.
5 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon
6 request, prepare the copy of the public record and shall not require
7 the person who has requested the copy to prepare the copy himself
8 or herself.
9 Sec. 19. The provisions of subsection 1 of NRS 218D.380 do
10 not apply to any provision of this act which adds or revises a
11 requirement to submit a report to the Legislature.
12 Sec. 20. This act becomes effective on July 1, 2025.
