EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public works; creating a program to gather data on the use of
job order contracts for certain public works; authorizing certain public
bodies to enter into job order contracts for [the maintenance, repair,
alteration, demolition, renovation, remediation or] minor construction
[of a] performed on an existing public work; prescribing the
procedure for awarding a job order contract; making certain documents
and other information submitted by a person seeking a job order
contract confidential until a contract is awarded; prescribing
responsibilities of a contractor who enters into a job order contract; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prescribes general procedures for awarding a contract for a public work.
2 (Chapter 338 of NRS) Existing law also authorizes a local government to comply with
3 alternative procedures for awarding a contract for a public work. (NRS 338.1373) Senate Bill
4 No. 67 of the 2021 Legislative Session established a pilot program to gather data on the use of
5 job order contracts for certain public works in Clark County, the City of Henderson, the City
6 of Las Vegas, the City of North Las Vegas and the Clark County Water Reclamation District
7 and authorized those public bodies, as part of the pilot program, to enter into job order
8 contracts for the maintenance, repair, alteration, demolition, renovation, remediation or minor
9 construction of a public work. (Chapter 523, Statutes of Nevada 2021, at page 3509) The pilot
10 program expires on June 30, 2025. (Section 15 of chapter 523, Statutes of Nevada 2021, at
11 page 3514) Sections 2-16 of this bill: (1) establish a similar, permanent program; (2) authorize
12 certain public bodies to award job order contracts for certain public works; and (3) set forth
13 various requirements and restrictions concerning the use of job order contracts by those public
14 bodies. Section 2 provides that the provisions of sections 2-16 apply only to a public body
15 that is: (1) a county whose population is 700,000 or more (currently only Clark County); (2) a
16 city whose population is 150,000 or more located in such a county (currently the Cities of
17 Henderson, Las Vegas and North Las Vegas); or (3) a general improvement district located in
18 such a county which is granted certain powers relating to sanitary sewer systems. (NRS
19 318.140)
Assembly Amendment No. 10 to Assembly Bill No. 43 Page 4
20 Section 3 establishes a program to gather data on the use of job order contracts for certain
21 public works and directs each public body to gather and report data on the use of job order
22 contracts. Sections 5-8 define certain terms for the purposes of this bill. Section 9 authorizes a
23 public body to award job order contracts for [the maintenance, repair, alteration, demolition,
24 renovation, remediation or] minor construction [of] performed on an existing public [works.]
25 work. Section 17 of this bill revises the list of procedures by which a local government may
26 award a contract for a public work to include the use of job order contracts if the local
27 government is a public body to which the provisions of sections 2-16 apply pursuant to
28 section 2.
29 Section 9 requires a job order contract to be for a fixed period and provide for indefinite
30 types and quantities of work and delivery times. Section 9 provides that a job order contract:
31 (1) must not be for work exclusive to one trade for which a license as a specialty contractor is
32 required; and (2) must require a contractor to prepare and submit a proposal for each job
33 order. Section 9 requires such a proposal to include the proposed price for the job order, each
34 construction task required to perform the job order, the unit price for each such task and the
35 adjustment factor applicable to the performance of the task. Section 9 also requires a public
36 body , after holding a public hearing on the matter, to adopt a written policy for the
37 assignment of job orders and limits the total dollar amount of job order contracts that may be
38 awarded annually by each public body.
39 Section 10 prescribes the qualifications a contractor who wishes to enter into a job order
40 contract must meet. Section 11 requires a public body or its authorized representative to
41 advertise requests for proposals or similar solicitation documents for job order contracts.
42 Section 11 also prescribes: (1) the contents of such advertisements or similar solicitation
43 documents; and (2) requirements for proposals. Sections 12 and 18 of this bill make any
44 document or other information submitted to a public body in response to a request for
45 proposals or similar solicitation document for a job order contract confidential and prohibit
46 disclosure of any such document or information until notice of intent to award the contract is
47 issued.
48 Section 13 prescribes the method for selecting a contractor for a job order contract.
49 Specifically, section 13 requires a public body or its authorized representative to appoint a
50 panel to rank the proposals submitted in response to the request for proposals and award a job
51 order contract to one or more applicants.
52 Section 14 prescribes certain responsibilities of a contractor who enters into a job order
53 contract relating to contracting for the services of a subcontractor, supplier or professional.
54 Section 14 also prohibits a contractor who enters into a job order contract from performing
55 more than 50 percent of the estimated cost of a work order himself or herself, or using his or
56 her own employees.
57 Section 9 requires a job order contract to provide for the use of job orders, which are
58 defined in section 7 as an order issued for a definite scope of work to be performed for a fixed
59 price pursuant to a job order contract. Section 15 requires a contractor to submit a list of each
60 subcontractor whom the contractor intends to engage before a public body issues a job order.
61 Section 16 requires a public body to submit a quarterly report that contains certain
62 information relating to job order contracts to the governing body of the public body. Section
63 16 also requires a governing body to annually submit to the Director of the Legislative
64 Counsel Bureau a written report including the information reported to the governing body
65 during the immediately preceding calendar year.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 338 of NRS is hereby amended by adding thereto the
2 provisions set forth as sections 2 to 16, inclusive, of this act.
3 Sec. 2. The provisions of sections 2 to 16, inclusive, of this act apply only to
4 a public body that is:
5 1. A county whose population is 700,000 or more;
Assembly Amendment No. 10 to Assembly Bill No. 43 Page 5
1 2. A city whose population is 150,000 or more located in a county whose
2 population is 700,000 or more; or
3 3. A general improvement district established pursuant to chapter 318 of
4 NRS in a county whose population is 700,000 or more which is granted the
5 powers set forth in NRS 318.140.
6 Sec. 3. 1. The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
7 (a) It is in the best interest of the State to ensure that contracting and bidding
8 procedures for public works in this State are efficient and cost-effective.
9 (b) The procedures for awarding a contract for a public work authorized by
10 existing law may create barriers to the efficient and cost-effective awarding of
11 contracts for [the maintenance, repair, alteration, demolition, renovation,
12 remediation or] minor construction [of a] performed on an existing public work.
13 (c) Reducing any such barriers will benefit the public and promote the timely
14 completion of certain public works projects that are critical for the health and
15 safety of members of the public who use public buildings and facilities.
16 (d) The voluminous and unpredictable amount of work for which certain
17 public bodies in large counties in this State must award contracts presents unique
18 challenges for these bodies.
19 (e) The use of job order contracting eliminates certain administrative
20 burdens associated with traditional procurement methods and enables such a
21 public body to efficiently manage the numerous [renovation, repair and
22 maintenance] minor construction projects required for existing facilities.
23 (f) The provisions of sections 2 to 16, inclusive, of this act are not intended to
24 prohibit a public body from awarding a contract for a public work pursuant to
25 any other procedure authorized pursuant to this chapter.
26 2. The Legislature therefore:
27 (a) Establishes a program to gather data on the use of job order contracts for
28 [the maintenance, repair, alteration, demolition, renovation, remediation and]
29 minor construction [of a] performed on an existing public work; and

32 this act.
33 Sec. 4. As used in sections 2 to 16, inclusive, of this act, unless the context
34 otherwise requires, the words and terms defined in sections 5 to 8, inclusive, of
35 this act have the meanings ascribed to them in those sections.
36 Sec. 5. “Adjustment factor” means the adjustment that is multiplied by a
37 contractor against the unit price listed in the unit price catalog for the job order
38 contract, which must reflect any overhead cost or profit to which a selected
39 contractor is entitled.
40 Sec. 6. “Construction task” means an item of work:
41 1. That is included in a job order; and
42 2. For which a unit price is set forth in a unit price catalog or priced using
43 the formula or method prescribed by section 11 of this act.
44 Sec. 7. “Job order” means an order issued by a public body for a definite

47 section 13 of this act.
48 Sec. 9. 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2, a public body may
49 award a job order contract for [the maintenance, repair, alteration, demolition,
50 renovation, remediation or] minor construction [of a] performed on an existing
51 public work. A job order contract must:

8 (e) Not be for work exclusive to one trade for which a license as a specialty
9 contractor is required.
10 2. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3, a public body may not
11 award more than $25,000,000 annually in job order contracts.
12 3. If the total dollar amount of all job order contracts awarded by a public
13 body in any 1 year is less than the maximum dollar amount of job order contracts
14 allowed to be awarded for that year pursuant to subsection 2, the difference
15 between those amounts may be added to the total dollar amount of job order
16 contracts that a public body may award in the immediately following year.
17 4. A public body shall , after holding a public hearing on the matter, adopt
18 a written policy for the assignment of job orders, which must include, without

2 710.159, 711.600, and section 12 of this act, sections 35, 38 and 41 of chapter 478,
3 Statutes of Nevada 2011 and section 2 of chapter 391, Statutes of Nevada 2013 and
4 unless otherwise declared by law to be confidential, all public books and public
5 records of a governmental entity must be open at all times during office hours to
6 inspection by any person, and may be fully copied or an abstract or memorandum
7 may be prepared from those public books and public records. Any such copies,
8 abstracts or memoranda may be used to supply the general public with copies,
9 abstracts or memoranda of the records or may be used in any other way to the
10 advantage of the governmental entity or of the general public. This section does not
11 supersede or in any manner affect the federal laws governing copyrights or enlarge,
12 diminish or affect in any other manner the rights of a person in any written book or
13 record which is copyrighted pursuant to federal law.
14 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record which is
15 copyrighted solely because it is copyrighted.
16 3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a public book or
17 record shall not deny a request made pursuant to subsection 1 to inspect or copy or
18 receive a copy of a public book or record on the basis that the requested public
19 book or record contains information that is confidential if the governmental entity
20 can redact, delete, conceal or separate, including, without limitation, electronically,
21 the confidential information from the information included in the public book or
22 record that is not otherwise confidential.
23 4. If requested, a governmental entity shall provide a copy of a public record
24 in an electronic format by means of an electronic medium. Nothing in this
25 subsection requires a governmental entity to provide a copy of a public record in an
26 electronic format or by means of an electronic medium if:
27 (a) The public record:
28 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
29 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
30 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by means of an
31 electronic medium would:
32 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
33 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential and that
34 cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from information that is not
35 otherwise confidential.
36 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who has legal
37 custody or control of a public record:
38 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the medium that
39 is requested because the officer, employee or agent has already prepared or would
40 prefer to provide the copy in a different medium.
41 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon request, prepare
42 the copy of the public record and shall not require the person who has requested the
43 copy to prepare the copy himself or herself.
44 Sec. 19. The provisions of subsection 1 of NRS 218D.380 do not apply to
45 any provision of this act which adds or revises a requirement to submit a report to
46 the Legislature.
47 Sec. 20. This act becomes effective on July 1, 2025.

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public works; creating a program to gather data on the use of
job order contracts for certain public works; authorizing certain public
bodies to enter into job order contracts for [the maintenance, repair,
alteration, demolition, renovation, remediation or] minor construction
[of a] performed on an existing public work; prescribing the
procedure for awarding a job order contract; making certain documents
and other information submitted by a person seeking a job order
contract confidential until a contract is awarded; prescribing
responsibilities of a contractor who enters into a job order contract; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prescribes general procedures for awarding a contract for a public work.
2 (Chapter 338 of NRS) Existing law also authorizes a local government to comply with
3 alternative procedures for awarding a contract for a public work. (NRS 338.1373) Senate Bill
4 No. 67 of the 2021 Legislative Session established a pilot program to gather data on the use of
5 job order contracts for certain public works in Clark County, the City of Henderson, the City
6 of Las Vegas, the City of North Las Vegas and the Clark County Water Reclamation District
7 and authorized those public bodies, as part of the pilot program, to enter into job order
8 contracts for the maintenance, repair, alteration, demolition, renovation, remediation or minor
9 construction of a public work. (Chapter 523, Statutes of Nevada 2021, at page 3509) The pilot
10 program expires on June 30, 2025. (Section 15 of chapter 523, Statutes of Nevada 2021, at
11 page 3514) Sections 2-16 of this bill: (1) establish a similar, permanent program; (2) authorize
12 certain public bodies to award job order contracts for certain public works; and (3) set forth
13 various requirements and restrictions concerning the use of job order contracts by those public
14 bodies. Section 2 provides that the provisions of sections 2-16 apply only to a public body
15 that is: (1) a county whose population is 700,000 or more (currently only Clark County); (2) a
16 city whose population is 150,000 or more located in such a county (currently the Cities of
17 Henderson, Las Vegas and North Las Vegas); or (3) a general improvement district located in
18 such a county which is granted certain powers relating to sanitary sewer systems. (NRS
19 318.140)

Assembly Amendment No. 10 to Assembly Bill No. 43 Page 4
20 Section 3 establishes a program to gather data on the use of job order contracts for certain
21 public works and directs each public body to gather and report data on the use of job order
22 contracts. Sections 5-8 define certain terms for the purposes of this bill. Section 9 authorizes a
23 public body to award job order contracts for [the maintenance, repair, alteration, demolition,
24 renovation, remediation or] minor construction [of] performed on an existing public [works.]
25 work. Section 17 of this bill revises the list of procedures by which a local government may
26 award a contract for a public work to include the use of job order contracts if the local
27 government is a public body to which the provisions of sections 2-16 apply pursuant to
28 section 2.
29 Section 9 requires a job order contract to be for a fixed period and provide for indefinite
30 types and quantities of work and delivery times. Section 9 provides that a job order contract:
31 (1) must not be for work exclusive to one trade for which a license as a specialty contractor is
32 required; and (2) must require a contractor to prepare and submit a proposal for each job
33 order. Section 9 requires such a proposal to include the proposed price for the job order, each
34 construction task required to perform the job order, the unit price for each such task and the
35 adjustment factor applicable to the performance of the task. Section 9 also requires a public
36 body , after holding a public hearing on the matter, to adopt a written policy for the
37 assignment of job orders and limits the total dollar amount of job order contracts that may be
38 awarded annually by each public body.
39 Section 10 prescribes the qualifications a contractor who wishes to enter into a job order
40 contract must meet. Section 11 requires a public body or its authorized representative to
41 advertise requests for proposals or similar solicitation documents for job order contracts.
42 Section 11 also prescribes: (1) the contents of such advertisements or similar solicitation
43 documents; and (2) requirements for proposals. Sections 12 and 18 of this bill make any
44 document or other information submitted to a public body in response to a request for
45 proposals or similar solicitation document for a job order contract confidential and prohibit
46 disclosure of any such document or information until notice of intent to award the contract is
47 issued.
48 Section 13 prescribes the method for selecting a contractor for a job order contract.
49 Specifically, section 13 requires a public body or its authorized representative to appoint a
50 panel to rank the proposals submitted in response to the request for proposals and award a job
51 order contract to one or more applicants.
52 Section 14 prescribes certain responsibilities of a contractor who enters into a job order
53 contract relating to contracting for the services of a subcontractor, supplier or professional.
54 Section 14 also prohibits a contractor who enters into a job order contract from performing
55 more than 50 percent of the estimated cost of a work order himself or herself, or using his or
56 her own employees.
57 Section 9 requires a job order contract to provide for the use of job orders, which are
58 defined in section 7 as an order issued for a definite scope of work to be performed for a fixed
59 price pursuant to a job order contract. Section 15 requires a contractor to submit a list of each
60 subcontractor whom the contractor intends to engage before a public body issues a job order.
61 Section 16 requires a public body to submit a quarterly report that contains certain
62 information relating to job order contracts to the governing body of the public body. Section
63 16 also requires a governing body to annually submit to the Director of the Legislative
64 Counsel Bureau a written report including the information reported to the governing body
65 during the immediately preceding calendar year.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 338 of NRS is hereby amended by adding thereto the
2 provisions set forth as sections 2 to 16, inclusive, of this act.
3 Sec. 2. The provisions of sections 2 to 16, inclusive, of this act apply only to
4 a public body that is:
5 1. A county whose population is 700,000 or more;

Assembly Amendment No. 10 to Assembly Bill No. 43 Page 5
1 2. A city whose population is 150,000 or more located in a county whose
2 population is 700,000 or more; or
3 3. A general improvement district established pursuant to chapter 318 of

5 powers set forth in NRS 318.140.

7 (a) It is in the best interest of the State to ensure that contracting and bidding
8 procedures for public works in this State are efficient and cost-effective.
9 (b) The procedures for awarding a contract for a public work authorized by
10 existing law may create barriers to the efficient and cost-effective awarding of
11 contracts for [the maintenance, repair, alteration, demolition, renovation,
12 remediation or] minor construction [of a] performed on an existing public work.
13 (c) Reducing any such barriers will benefit the public and promote the timely
14 completion of certain public works projects that are critical for the health and
15 safety of members of the public who use public buildings and facilities.
16 (d) The voluminous and unpredictable amount of work for which certain
17 public bodies in large counties in this State must award contracts presents unique
18 challenges for these bodies.
19 (e) The use of job order contracting eliminates certain administrative
20 burdens associated with traditional procurement methods and enables such a
21 public body to efficiently manage the numerous [renovation, repair and
22 maintenance] minor construction projects required for existing facilities.
23 (f) The provisions of sections 2 to 16, inclusive, of this act are not intended to
24 prohibit a public body from awarding a contract for a public work pursuant to
25 any other procedure authorized pursuant to this chapter.
26 2. The Legislature therefore:
27 (a) Establishes a program to gather data on the use of job order contracts for
28 [the maintenance, repair, alteration, demolition, renovation, remediation and]
29 minor construction [of a] performed on an existing public work; and

32 this act.
33 Sec. 4. As used in sections 2 to 16, inclusive, of this act, unless the context
34 otherwise requires, the words and terms defined in sections 5 to 8, inclusive, of
35 this act have the meanings ascribed to them in those sections.
36 Sec. 5. “Adjustment factor” means the adjustment that is multiplied by a
37 contractor against the unit price listed in the unit price catalog for the job order
38 contract, which must reflect any overhead cost or profit to which a selected
39 contractor is entitled.
40 Sec. 6. “Construction task” means an item of work:
41 1. That is included in a job order; and
42 2. For which a unit price is set forth in a unit price catalog or priced using
43 the formula or method prescribed by section 11 of this act.
44 Sec. 7. “Job order” means an order issued by a public body for a definite

47 section 13 of this act.
48 Sec. 9. 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2, a public body may

51 public work. A job order contract must:

8 (e) Not be for work exclusive to one trade for which a license as a specialty
9 contractor is required.
10 2. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3, a public body may not
11 award more than $25,000,000 annually in job order contracts.
12 3. If the total dollar amount of all job order contracts awarded by a public
13 body in any 1 year is less than the maximum dollar amount of job order contracts
14 allowed to be awarded for that year pursuant to subsection 2, the difference
15 between those amounts may be added to the total dollar amount of job order
16 contracts that a public body may award in the immediately following year.
17 4. A public body shall , after holding a public hearing on the matter, adopt
18 a written policy for the assignment of job orders, which must include, without

2 710.159, 711.600, and section 12 of this act, sections 35, 38 and 41 of chapter 478,
3 Statutes of Nevada 2011 and section 2 of chapter 391, Statutes of Nevada 2013 and
4 unless otherwise declared by law to be confidential, all public books and public
5 records of a governmental entity must be open at all times during office hours to
6 inspection by any person, and may be fully copied or an abstract or memorandum
7 may be prepared from those public books and public records. Any such copies,
8 abstracts or memoranda may be used to supply the general public with copies,
9 abstracts or memoranda of the records or may be used in any other way to the
10 advantage of the governmental entity or of the general public. This section does not
11 supersede or in any manner affect the federal laws governing copyrights or enlarge,
12 diminish or affect in any other manner the rights of a person in any written book or
13 record which is copyrighted pursuant to federal law.
14 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record which is
15 copyrighted solely because it is copyrighted.
16 3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a public book or
17 record shall not deny a request made pursuant to subsection 1 to inspect or copy or
18 receive a copy of a public book or record on the basis that the requested public
19 book or record contains information that is confidential if the governmental entity
20 can redact, delete, conceal or separate, including, without limitation, electronically,
21 the confidential information from the information included in the public book or
22 record that is not otherwise confidential.
23 4. If requested, a governmental entity shall provide a copy of a public record
24 in an electronic format by means of an electronic medium. Nothing in this
25 subsection requires a governmental entity to provide a copy of a public record in an
26 electronic format or by means of an electronic medium if:
27 (a) The public record:
28 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
29 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
30 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by means of an
31 electronic medium would:
32 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
33 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential and that
34 cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from information that is not
35 otherwise confidential.
36 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who has legal
37 custody or control of a public record:
38 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the medium that
39 is requested because the officer, employee or agent has already prepared or would
40 prefer to provide the copy in a different medium.
41 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon request, prepare
42 the copy of the public record and shall not require the person who has requested the
43 copy to prepare the copy himself or herself.
44 Sec. 19. The provisions of subsection 1 of NRS 218D.380 do not apply to
45 any provision of this act which adds or revises a requirement to submit a report to
46 the Legislature.
47 Sec. 20. This act becomes effective on July 1, 2025.
