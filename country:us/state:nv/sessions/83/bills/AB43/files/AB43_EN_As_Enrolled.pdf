Assembly Bill No. 43–Committee
on Government Affairs
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to public works; creating a program to gather data
on the use of job order contracts for certain public works;
authorizing certain public bodies to enter into job order
contracts for minor construction performed on an existing
public work; prescribing the procedure for awarding a job
order contract; making certain documents and other
information submitted by a person seeking a job order
contract confidential until a contract is awarded; prescribing
responsibilities of a contractor who enters into a job order
contract; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law prescribes general procedures for awarding a contract for a public
work. (Chapter 338 of NRS) Existing law also authorizes a local government to
comply with alternative procedures for awarding a contract for a public work. (NRS
338.1373) Senate Bill No. 67 of the 2021 Legislative Session established a pilot
program to gather data on the use of job order contracts for certain public works in
Clark County, the City of Henderson, the City of Las Vegas, the City of North Las
Vegas and the Clark County Water Reclamation District and authorized those
public bodies, as part of the pilot program, to enter into job order contracts for the
maintenance, repair, alteration, demolition, renovation, remediation or minor
construction of a public work. (Chapter 523, Statutes of Nevada 2021, at page
3509) The pilot program expires on June 30, 2025. (Section 15 of chapter 523,
Statutes of Nevada 2021, at page 3514) Sections 2-16 of this bill: (1) establish a
similar, permanent program; (2) authorize certain public bodies to award job order
contracts for certain public works; and (3) set forth various requirements and
restrictions concerning the use of job order contracts by those public bodies.
Section 2 provides that the provisions of sections 2-16 apply only to a public body
that is: (1) a county whose population is 700,000 or more (currently only Clark
County); (2) a city whose population is 150,000 or more located in such a county
(currently the Cities of Henderson, Las Vegas and North Las Vegas); or (3) a
general improvement district located in such a county which is granted certain
powers relating to sanitary sewer systems. (NRS 318.140)
Section 3 establishes a program to gather data on the use of job order contracts
for certain public works and directs each public body to gather and report data on
the use of job order contracts. Sections 5-8 define certain terms for the purposes of
this bill. Section 9 authorizes a public body to award job order contracts for minor
construction performed on an existing public work. Section 17 of this bill revises
the list of procedures by which a local government may award a contract for a
public work to include the use of job order contracts if the local government is a
public body to which the provisions of sections 2-16 apply pursuant to section 2.
Section 9 requires a job order contract to be for a fixed period and provide for
indefinite types and quantities of work and delivery times. Section 9 provides that a
job order contract: (1) must not be for work exclusive to one trade for which a
license as a specialty contractor is required; and (2) must require a contractor to
prepare and submit a proposal for each job order. Section 9 requires such a
-

– 2 –
proposal to include the proposed price for the job order, each construction task
required to perform the job order, the unit price for each such task and the
adjustment factor applicable to the performance of the task. Section 9 also requires
a public body, after holding a public hearing on the matter, to adopt a written policy
for the assignment of job orders and limits the total dollar amount of job order
contracts that may be awarded annually by each public body.
Section 9.5 of this bill sets forth certain requirements for a job order contract
with respect to workers who perform work under contract, including the
requirement that at least 25 percent of such workers be enrolled in or graduates of
an apprenticeship program. Section 14.5 authorizes a public body to waive that
requirement under certain circumstances.
Section 10 prescribes the qualifications a contractor who wishes to enter into a
job order contract must meet. Section 11 requires a public body or its authorized
representative to advertise requests for proposals or similar solicitation documents
for job order contracts. Section 11 also prescribes: (1) the contents of such
advertisements or similar solicitation documents; and (2) requirements for
proposals. Sections 12 and 18 of this bill make any document or other information
submitted to a public body in response to a request for proposals or similar
solicitation document for a job order contract confidential and prohibit disclosure of
any such document or information until notice of intent to award the contract is
issued.
Section 13 prescribes the method for selecting a contractor for a job order
contract. Specifically, section 13 requires a public body or its authorized
representative to appoint a panel to rank the proposals submitted in response to the
request for proposals and award a job order contract to one or more applicants.
Section 14 prescribes certain responsibilities of a contractor who enters into a
job order contract relating to contracting for the services of a subcontractor,
supplier or professional. Section 14 also prohibits a contractor who enters into a job
order contract from performing more than 50 percent of the estimated cost of a
work order himself or herself, or using his or her own employees.
Section 9 requires a job order contract to provide for the use of job orders,
which are defined in section 7 as an order issued for a definite scope of work to be
performed for a fixed price pursuant to a job order contract. Section 15 requires a
contractor to submit a list of each subcontractor whom the contractor intends to
engage before a public body issues a job order. Section 16 requires a public body to
submit a quarterly report that contains certain information relating to job order
contracts to the governing body of the public body. Section 16 also requires a
governing body to annually submit to the Director of the Legislative Counsel
Bureau a written report including the information reported to the governing body
during the immediately preceding calendar year.

(a) It is in the best interest of the State to ensure that

performed on an existing public work.
(c) Reducing any such barriers will benefit the public and
promote the timely completion of certain public works projects
that are critical for the health and safety of members of the public
who use public buildings and facilities.
(d) The voluminous and unpredictable amount of work for
which certain public bodies in large counties in this State must
award contracts presents unique challenges for these bodies.
(e) The use of job order contracting eliminates certain
administrative burdens associated with traditional procurement
methods and enables such a public body to efficiently manage the
numerous minor construction projects required for existing
facilities.
(f) The provisions of sections 2 to 16, inclusive, of this act are
not intended to prohibit a public body from awarding a contract
for a public work pursuant to any other procedure authorized

3. If the total dollar amount of all job order contracts
awarded by a public body in any 1 year is less than the maximum
dollar amount of job order contracts allowed to be awarded for

amounts may be added to the total dollar amount of job order
contracts that a public body may award in the immediately
following year.
4. A public body shall, after holding a public hearing on the
matter, adopt a written policy for the assignment of job orders,
which must include, without limitation, the procedure by which a

4. If requested, a governmental entity shall provide a copy of a

(1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
(2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
(b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by
means of an electronic medium would:

information that is not otherwise confidential.
5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who
has legal custody or control of a public record:
(a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the
medium that is requested because the officer, employee or agent has
already prepared or would prefer to provide the copy in a different
medium.
(b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon
request, prepare the copy of the public record and shall not require
