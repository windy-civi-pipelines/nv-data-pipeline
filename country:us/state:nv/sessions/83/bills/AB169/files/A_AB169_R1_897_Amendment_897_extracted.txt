EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to insurance; establishing the applicability of provisions requiring
policies of health insurance to include certain coverage; requiring that
certain health insurance policies and health plans include coverage for
certain forms of speech-language pathology as treatment for stuttering
for persons who are less than 26 years of age; prohibiting certain
limitations on such coverage; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires public and private policies of health insurance and health plans
2 regulated under Nevada law to include certain coverage. (NRS 287.010, 287.04335,
3 422.27172-422.272428, 689A.04033-689A.0465, 689B.0303-689B.0379, 689C.1652-
4 689C.169, 689C.194, 689C.1945, 689C.195, 689C.425, 695A.184-695A.1875, 695A.265,
5 695B.1901-695B.1948, 695C.050, 695C.1691-695C.176, 695G.162-695G.177) Existing law
6 also requires employers to provide certain benefits for health care to employees, including the
7 coverage required of health insurers, if the employer provides health benefits for its
8 employees. (NRS 608.1555) Sections 2.3 and 4.3 of this bill provide that certain provisions
9 requiring a policy of individual or group health insurance to include certain coverage are
10 inapplicable to a policy that only provides coverage for a specified disease or illness or that
11 only provides a limited benefit.
12 Sections 2.7, 4.7-10, 12 [and] , 12.5, 14 [-16] and 16 of this bill require that certain
13 public and private policies of health insurance and health plans, including Medicaid [,] but
14 excluding the Public Employees’ Benefits Program, include coverage for habilitative and
15 rehabilitative speech-language pathology as a treatment for stuttering for persons who are less
16 than 26 years of age. Sections 1, 2.7, 4.7-10, 12 , [and] 14 [-16] and 16 of this bill
17 additionally prohibit an insurer from imposing a maximum annual limit on the coverage,
18 limiting coverage based on the cause of the stuttering or imposing medical management
19 techniques on those benefits. Section 13 of this bill makes a conforming change to require the
20 Director of the Department of Health and Human Services to administer the provisions of
21 section 16 in the same manner as other provisions relating to Medicaid. Section 3 of this bill
22 authorizes the Commissioner of Insurance to require that certain policies of health insurance
23 issued by a domestic insurer to a person who resides in another state include the coverage
24 required by sections 2.3 and 2.7. Section 11 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner to
Assembly Amendment No. 897 to Assembly Bill No. 169 First Reprint Page 4
25 suspend or revoke the certificate of a health maintenance organization that fails to comply
26 with the requirements of section 9. The Commissioner would also be authorized to take such
27 action against other health insurers who fail to comply with the requirements of sections 2.7,
28 4.7-8 or 12. (NRS 680A.200)

~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to insurance; establishing the applicability of provisions requiring
policies of health insurance to include certain coverage; requiring that
certain health insurance policies and health plans include coverage for
certain forms of speech-language pathology as treatment for stuttering
for persons who are less than 26 years of age; prohibiting certain
limitations on such coverage; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires public and private policies of health insurance and health plans
2 regulated under Nevada law to include certain coverage. (NRS 287.010, 287.04335,
3 422.27172-422.272428, 689A.04033-689A.0465, 689B.0303-689B.0379, 689C.1652-
4 689C.169, 689C.194, 689C.1945, 689C.195, 689C.425, 695A.184-695A.1875, 695A.265,
5 695B.1901-695B.1948, 695C.050, 695C.1691-695C.176, 695G.162-695G.177) Existing law
6 also requires employers to provide certain benefits for health care to employees, including the
7 coverage required of health insurers, if the employer provides health benefits for its
8 employees. (NRS 608.1555) Sections 2.3 and 4.3 of this bill provide that certain provisions
9 requiring a policy of individual or group health insurance to include certain coverage are
10 inapplicable to a policy that only provides coverage for a specified disease or illness or that
11 only provides a limited benefit.
12 Sections 2.7, 4.7-10, 12 [and] , 12.5, 14 [-16] and 16 of this bill require that certain
13 public and private policies of health insurance and health plans, including Medicaid [,] but
14 excluding the Public Employees’ Benefits Program, include coverage for habilitative and
15 rehabilitative speech-language pathology as a treatment for stuttering for persons who are less
16 than 26 years of age. Sections 1, 2.7, 4.7-10, 12 , [and] 14 [-16] and 16 of this bill
17 additionally prohibit an insurer from imposing a maximum annual limit on the coverage,
18 limiting coverage based on the cause of the stuttering or imposing medical management
19 techniques on those benefits. Section 13 of this bill makes a conforming change to require the
20 Director of the Department of Health and Human Services to administer the provisions of
21 section 16 in the same manner as other provisions relating to Medicaid. Section 3 of this bill
22 authorizes the Commissioner of Insurance to require that certain policies of health insurance
23 issued by a domestic insurer to a person who resides in another state include the coverage
24 required by sections 2.3 and 2.7. Section 11 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner to

Assembly Amendment No. 897 to Assembly Bill No. 169 First Reprint Page 4
25 suspend or revoke the certificate of a health maintenance organization that fails to comply
26 with the requirements of section 9. The Commissioner would also be authorized to take such
27 action against other health insurers who fail to comply with the requirements of sections 2.7,
28 4.7-8 or 12. (NRS 680A.200)
