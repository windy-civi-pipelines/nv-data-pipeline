AN ACT relating to insurance; requiring that certain health
insurance policies and health plans include coverage for
certain forms of speech-language pathology as treatment
for stuttering for persons who are less than 18 years of
age; prohibiting certain limitations on such coverage; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires public and private policies of insurance regulated under
2 Nevada law to include certain coverage. (NRS 287.010, 287.04335, 422.27172-
3 422.272428, 689A.04033-689A.0465, 689B.0303-689B.0379, 689C.1652-
4 689C.169, 689C.194, 689C.1945, 689C.195, 689C.425, 695A.184-695A.1875,
5 695A.265, 695B.1901-695B.1948, 695C.050, 695C.1691-695C.176, 695G.162-
6 695G.177) Existing law also requires employers to provide certain benefits for
7 health care to employees, including the coverage required of health insurers, if the
8 employer provides health benefits for its employees. (NRS 608.1555)
9 Sections 2, 4-10, 12 and 14-16 of this bill require that certain public and
10 private policies of health insurance and health plans, including Medicaid, include
11 coverage for habilitative and rehabilitative speech-language pathology as a
12 treatment for stuttering for persons who are less than 18 years of age. Sections 1, 2,
13 4-10, 12 and 14-16 of this bill additionally prohibit an insurer from imposing a
14 maximum annual limit on the coverage, limiting coverage based on the cause of the
15 stuttering or imposing medical management techniques on those benefits. Section
16 13 of this bill makes a conforming change to require the Director of the Department
17 of Health and Human Services to administer the provisions of section 16 in the
18 same manner as other provisions relating to Medicaid. Section 3 of this bill
19 authorizes the Commissioner of Insurance to require that certain policies of health
-
*AB169*

– 2 –
20 insurance issued by a domestic insurer to a person who resides in another state
21 include the coverage required by section 2. Section 11 of this bill authorizes the
22 Commissioner to suspend or revoke the certificate of a health maintenance
23 organization that fails to comply with the requirements of section 9. The
24 Commissioner would also be authorized to take such action against other health
25 insurers who fail to comply with the requirements of sections 2, 4-8 or 12.
