EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to insurance; establishing the applicability of provisions
requiring policies of health insurance to include certain coverage;
requiring that certain health insurance policies and health plans include
coverage for certain forms of speech-language pathology as treatment
for stuttering for persons who are less than [18] 26 years of age;
prohibiting certain limitations on such coverage; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires public and private policies of health insurance and health plans
2 regulated under Nevada law to include certain coverage. (NRS 287.010, 287.04335,
3 422.27172-422.272428, 689A.04033-689A.0465, 689B.0303-689B.0379, 689C.1652-
4 689C.169, 689C.194, 689C.1945, 689C.195, 689C.425, 695A.184-695A.1875, 695A.265,
5 695B.1901-695B.1948, 695C.050, 695C.1691-695C.176, 695G.162-695G.177) Existing law
6 also requires employers to provide certain benefits for health care to employees, including the
7 coverage required of health insurers, if the employer provides health benefits for its
8 employees. (NRS 608.1555) Sections 2.3 and 4.3 of this bill provide that certain
9 provisions requiring a policy of individual or group health insurance to include certain
10 coverage are inapplicable to a policy that only provides coverage for a specified disease
11 or illness or that only provides a limited benefit.
12 Sections [2, 4-10,] 2.7, 4.7-10, 12 and 14-16 of this bill require that certain public and
13 private policies of health insurance and health plans, including Medicaid, include coverage for
14 habilitative and rehabilitative speech-language pathology as a treatment for stuttering for
15 persons who are less than [18] 26 years of age. Sections 1, [2, 4-10,] 2.7, 4.7-10, 12 and 14-
16 16 of this bill additionally prohibit an insurer from imposing a maximum annual limit on the
17 coverage, limiting coverage based on the cause of the stuttering or imposing medical
18 management techniques on those benefits. Section 13 of this bill makes a conforming change
19 to require the Director of the Department of Health and Human Services to administer the
20 provisions of section 16 in the same manner as other provisions relating to Medicaid. Section
21 3 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner of Insurance to require that certain policies of
22 health insurance issued by a domestic insurer to a person who resides in another state include
Assembly Amendment No. 83 to Assembly Bill No. 169 Page 4
23 the coverage required by [section 2.] sections 2.3 and 2.7. Section 11 of this bill authorizes
24 the Commissioner to suspend or revoke the certificate of a health maintenance organization
25 that fails to comply with the requirements of section 9. The Commissioner would also be
26 authorized to take such action against other health insurers who fail to comply with the
27 requirements of sections [2, 4-8] 2.7, 4.7-8 or 12. (NRS 680A.200)

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to insurance; establishing the applicability of provisions
requiring policies of health insurance to include certain coverage;
requiring that certain health insurance policies and health plans include
coverage for certain forms of speech-language pathology as treatment
for stuttering for persons who are less than [18] 26 years of age;
prohibiting certain limitations on such coverage; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires public and private policies of health insurance and health plans
2 regulated under Nevada law to include certain coverage. (NRS 287.010, 287.04335,
3 422.27172-422.272428, 689A.04033-689A.0465, 689B.0303-689B.0379, 689C.1652-
4 689C.169, 689C.194, 689C.1945, 689C.195, 689C.425, 695A.184-695A.1875, 695A.265,
5 695B.1901-695B.1948, 695C.050, 695C.1691-695C.176, 695G.162-695G.177) Existing law
6 also requires employers to provide certain benefits for health care to employees, including the
7 coverage required of health insurers, if the employer provides health benefits for its
8 employees. (NRS 608.1555) Sections 2.3 and 4.3 of this bill provide that certain
9 provisions requiring a policy of individual or group health insurance to include certain
10 coverage are inapplicable to a policy that only provides coverage for a specified disease
11 or illness or that only provides a limited benefit.
12 Sections [2, 4-10,] 2.7, 4.7-10, 12 and 14-16 of this bill require that certain public and
13 private policies of health insurance and health plans, including Medicaid, include coverage for
14 habilitative and rehabilitative speech-language pathology as a treatment for stuttering for
15 persons who are less than [18] 26 years of age. Sections 1, [2, 4-10,] 2.7, 4.7-10, 12 and 14-
16 16 of this bill additionally prohibit an insurer from imposing a maximum annual limit on the
17 coverage, limiting coverage based on the cause of the stuttering or imposing medical
18 management techniques on those benefits. Section 13 of this bill makes a conforming change
19 to require the Director of the Department of Health and Human Services to administer the
20 provisions of section 16 in the same manner as other provisions relating to Medicaid. Section
21 3 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner of Insurance to require that certain policies of
22 health insurance issued by a domestic insurer to a person who resides in another state include

Assembly Amendment No. 83 to Assembly Bill No. 169 Page 4
23 the coverage required by [section 2.] sections 2.3 and 2.7. Section 11 of this bill authorizes
24 the Commissioner to suspend or revoke the certificate of a health maintenance organization
25 that fails to comply with the requirements of section 9. The Commissioner would also be
26 authorized to take such action against other health insurers who fail to comply with the
27 requirements of sections [2, 4-8] 2.7, 4.7-8 or 12. (NRS 680A.200)
