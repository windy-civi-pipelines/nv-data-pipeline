~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to insurance; establishing the applicability of
provisions requiring policies of health insurance to
include certain coverage; requiring that certain health
insurance policies and health plans include coverage for
certain forms of speech-language pathology as treatment
for stuttering for persons who are less than 26 years of
age; prohibiting certain limitations on such coverage; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires public and private policies of health insurance and health
2 plans regulated under Nevada law to include certain coverage. (NRS 287.010,
3 287.04335, 422.27172-422.272428, 689A.04033-689A.0465, 689B.0303-
4 689B.0379, 689C.1652-689C.169, 689C.194, 689C.1945, 689C.195, 689C.425,
5 695A.184-695A.1875, 695A.265, 695B.1901-695B.1948, 695C.050, 695C.1691-
6 695C.176, 695G.162-695G.177) Existing law also requires employers to provide
7 certain benefits for health care to employees, including the coverage required of
8 health insurers, if the employer provides health benefits for its employees. (NRS
9 608.1555) Sections 2.3 and 4.3 of this bill provide that certain provisions requiring
10 a policy of individual or group health insurance to include certain coverage are
11 inapplicable to a policy that only provides coverage for a specified disease or
12 illness or that only provides a limited benefit.
13 Sections 2.7, 4.7-10, 12 and 14-16 of this bill require that certain public and
14 private policies of health insurance and health plans, including Medicaid, include
15 coverage for habilitative and rehabilitative speech-language pathology as a
16 treatment for stuttering for persons who are less than 26 years of age. Sections 1,
17 2.7, 4.7-10, 12 and 14-16 of this bill additionally prohibit an insurer from imposing
-
*AB169_R1*
– 2 –
18 a maximum annual limit on the coverage, limiting coverage based on the cause of
19 the stuttering or imposing medical management techniques on those benefits.
20 Section 13 of this bill makes a conforming change to require the Director of the
21 Department of Health and Human Services to administer the provisions of section
22 16 in the same manner as other provisions relating to Medicaid. Section 3 of this
23 bill authorizes the Commissioner of Insurance to require that certain policies of
24 health insurance issued by a domestic insurer to a person who resides in another
25 state include the coverage required by sections 2.3 and 2.7. Section 11 of this bill
26 authorizes the Commissioner to suspend or revoke the certificate of a health
27 maintenance organization that fails to comply with the requirements of section 9.
28 The Commissioner would also be authorized to take such action against other
29 health insurers who fail to comply with the requirements of sections 2.7, 4.7-8 or
30 12. (NRS 680A.200)

~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to insurance; establishing the applicability of
provisions requiring policies of health insurance to
include certain coverage; requiring that certain health
insurance policies and health plans include coverage for
certain forms of speech-language pathology as treatment
for stuttering for persons who are less than 26 years of
age; prohibiting certain limitations on such coverage; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires public and private policies of health insurance and health
2 plans regulated under Nevada law to include certain coverage. (NRS 287.010,
3 287.04335, 422.27172-422.272428, 689A.04033-689A.0465, 689B.0303-
4 689B.0379, 689C.1652-689C.169, 689C.194, 689C.1945, 689C.195, 689C.425,
5 695A.184-695A.1875, 695A.265, 695B.1901-695B.1948, 695C.050, 695C.1691-
6 695C.176, 695G.162-695G.177) Existing law also requires employers to provide
7 certain benefits for health care to employees, including the coverage required of
8 health insurers, if the employer provides health benefits for its employees. (NRS
9 608.1555) Sections 2.3 and 4.3 of this bill provide that certain provisions requiring
10 a policy of individual or group health insurance to include certain coverage are
11 inapplicable to a policy that only provides coverage for a specified disease or
12 illness or that only provides a limited benefit.
13 Sections 2.7, 4.7-10, 12 and 14-16 of this bill require that certain public and
14 private policies of health insurance and health plans, including Medicaid, include
15 coverage for habilitative and rehabilitative speech-language pathology as a
16 treatment for stuttering for persons who are less than 26 years of age. Sections 1,
17 2.7, 4.7-10, 12 and 14-16 of this bill additionally prohibit an insurer from imposing
-
*AB169_R1*

– 2 –
18 a maximum annual limit on the coverage, limiting coverage based on the cause of
19 the stuttering or imposing medical management techniques on those benefits.
20 Section 13 of this bill makes a conforming change to require the Director of the
21 Department of Health and Human Services to administer the provisions of section
22 16 in the same manner as other provisions relating to Medicaid. Section 3 of this
23 bill authorizes the Commissioner of Insurance to require that certain policies of
24 health insurance issued by a domestic insurer to a person who resides in another
25 state include the coverage required by sections 2.3 and 2.7. Section 11 of this bill
26 authorizes the Commissioner to suspend or revoke the certificate of a health
27 maintenance organization that fails to comply with the requirements of section 9.
28 The Commissioner would also be authorized to take such action against other
29 health insurers who fail to comply with the requirements of sections 2.7, 4.7-8 or
30 12. (NRS 680A.200)
