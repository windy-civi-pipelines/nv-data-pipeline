Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 In general, existing law prohibits a person from committing certain acts
2 regarding pornography involving minors. (NRS 200.700-200.760) Section 1 of this
3 bill: (1) prohibits a person from receiving, distributing, producing, possessing or
4 accessing any obscene item or material which the person knows or reasonably
5 should know contains a depiction of a purported child engaging in sexual conduct;
6 and (2) provides that a person who violates this prohibition is guilty of a category B
7 felony. Section 1 also defines: (1) the term “depiction of a purported child” for
8 purposes of this prohibition to mean a visual representation that appears to depict
9 an actual child but may or may not depict an actual child; and (2) certain other
10 terms relating to the prohibition. Sections 2-5 of this bill make certain definitions,
11 exemptions and authorizations, which, under existing law, are generally applicable
12 to provisions concerning pornography involving minors, applicable to section 1.
13 Existing law: (1) prohibits a court from deferring judgment on a case if the
14 defendant has been convicted of a violent or sexual offense; (2) sets the maximum

– 2 –
15 period of probation or suspension of sentence for a violent or sexual offense at 60
16 months; and (3) prohibits the early discharge from probation of a person convicted
17 of a violent or sexual offense. (NRS 176.211, 176A.500, 176A.840, 202.876)
18 Existing law also requires a person to report certain violent or sexual offenses
19 against a child to a law enforcement agency under certain circumstances. (NRS
20 202.882) Section 6 of this bill makes a violation of section 1 a violent or sexual
21 offense for purposes of these provisions.
22 Existing law prohibits a court from ordering a victim of or a witness to certain
23 sexual offenses to take or submit to a psychological or psychiatric examination.
24 (NRS 50.700) Section 7 of this bill applies this prohibition to a victim of or a
25 witness to a violation of section 1.
26 Existing law defines the term “sexual offense” for the purposes of certain
27 provisions which prohibit a person convicted of a sexual offense from obtaining
28 certain licenses or employment or receiving certain services to include an offense
29 involving pornography and a minor. (NRS 62B.270, 62G.223, 424.031, 424.145,
30 432A.170, 432A.1755, 432B.198, 432B.199, 433B.183) Sections 8, 12, 13 and 32-
31 37 of this bill revise the list of sexual offenses to which these statutory provisions
32 apply to include a violation of section 1.
33 Section 9 of this bill requires a district attorney to provide certain
34 documentation to a victim of a violation of section 1 and, if the victim is less than
35 18 years of age, to his or her parent or guardian. (NRS 62C.120)
36 Section 10 of this bill makes certain restrictions concerning attendance in
37 school which are applicable to juveniles who are adjudicated delinquent for
38 committing sexual offenses applicable to a juvenile who is adjudicated delinquent
39 for committing a violation of section 1. (NRS 62F.100-62F.150) Section 11 of this
40 bill makes certain registration and community notification requirements which are
41 applicable to juveniles who are adjudicated delinquent for committing sexual
42 offenses applicable to a juvenile who is adjudicated delinquent for committing a
43 violation of section 1. (NRS 62F.205-62F.360)
44 Under existing law, the fingerprints of a child who is taken into custody for an
45 unlawful act that, if committed by an adult, would have been a sexual offense, must
46 be taken, retained locally and submitted to the Central Repository for Nevada
47 Records of Criminal History under certain circumstances. (NRS 62H.010) Section
48 14 of this bill makes these requirements applicable to a child who is taken into
49 custody for a violation of section 1.
50 Existing law requires the Director of the Department of Health and Human
51 Services to establish a program to compile and analyze data concerning juvenile
52 sex offenders. (NRS 62H.320) Existing law also requires the Division of Child and
53 Family Services of the Department to: (1) collect certain information concerning
54 each child adjudicated delinquent for committing a sexual offense; and (2) provide
55 the information collected by the Division to the Director for use in the program.
56 (NRS 62H.210, 62H.220, 62H.320) Sections 15 and 16 of this bill add a violation
57 of section 1 to the list of sexual offenses to which these requirements apply.
58 Sections 15 and 16 thereby require the Division to collect and provide to the
59 Department certain information concerning a child who is adjudicated delinquent
60 for a violation of section 1.
61 Existing law: (1) requires that a person convicted of certain sexual offenses
62 undergo a psychosexual evaluation as part of the presentence investigation report
63 prepared by the Division of Parole and Probation of the Department of Public
64 Safety; and (2) prohibits a court from granting probation to or suspending the
65 sentence of a person convicted of certain sexual offenses, unless the person who
66 conducts the psychosexual evaluation certifies that the person convicted of the
67 sexual offense does not represent a high risk to reoffend. (NRS 176.135, 176A.110)
68 Sections 18 and 19 of this bill add a violation of section 1 to the list of sexual
69 offenses that require a psychosexual evaluation to be conducted and for which a
-
*AB35*

– 3 –
70 court is prohibited from granting probation to or suspending the sentence of a
71 person, unless the person who conducts the psychosexual evaluation certifies that
72 the person does not represent a high risk to reoffend.
73 Existing law requires a court that grants probation to or suspends the sentence
74 of certain persons convicted of an offense that involved pornography and a minor to
75 order, as a condition of probation or suspension, that the person not own or use a
76 computer. (NRS 176A.413) Section 20 of this bill adds a violation of section 1 to
77 the list of offenses for which a court is required to issue such an order. Existing law
78 similarly requires the State Board of Parole Commissioners to require that certain
79 persons convicted of an offense that involved pornography and a minor not own or
80 use a computer. (NRS 213.1258) Section 26 of this bill adds a violation of section
81 1 to the list of offenses for which the Board is required to impose this condition of
82 parole.
83 Existing law requires a court to provide certain documentation to certain
84 persons if an offender is convicted of certain sexual offenses. (NRS 178.5698)
85 Section 21 of this bill requires that such documentation be provided to such persons
86 if an offender is convicted of a violation of section 1. Section 22 of this bill makes
87 the provisions of law which prohibit a person convicted of a sexual offense from
88 petitioning a court to seal the records relating to such a conviction applicable to a
89 person convicted of a violation of section 1. (NRS 179.245)
90 Existing law authorizes the Central Repository and its employees to inquire into
91 and inspect certain sealed records that constitute information relating to sexual
92 offenses and to notify employers of the information in accordance with federal laws
93 and regulations. (NRS 179.301) Section 23 of this bill revises the list of sexual
94 offenses to which this provision applies to include a violation of section 1.
95 Existing law defines the term “sexual offense” for the purpose of requiring
96 persons convicted of certain sexual offenses to be prohibited from certain
97 employment, to register as a sex offender, to comply with certain mandatory
98 conditions of probation or parole and to fulfill certain other requirements. (NRS
99 118A.335, 176.0913, 176A.410, 179D.095, 179D.097, 179D.441, 213.1099,
100 213.1245) Section 24 of this bill revises the list of sexual offenses to which these
101 statutory provisions apply to include a violation of section 1. Section 25 of this bill
102 designates an offender convicted of a violation of section 1 a Tier II offender for
103 the purpose of certain requirements relating to registration as a sex offender.
104 Sections 27-29 of this bill make a minor who was the victim of a violation of
105 section 1 or a parent or guardian of any such minor eligible to apply for
106 compensation from the Fund for the Compensation of Victims of Crime for certain
107 expenses and losses. (NRS 217.010-217.270)
108 Sections 30 and 31 of this bill establish the preferred manner of referring to
109 items or materials that depict or describe a minor as the subject of a sexual
110 portrayal or engaging in or simulating, or assisting others to engage in or simulate
111 sexual conduct in the Nevada Revised Statutes and the Nevada Administrative
112 Code. Sections 6-29 and 32-37 make conforming changes to replace words and
113 terms that are not preferred for use in the Nevada Revised Statutes, including the
114 term “child pornography” and various related terms, with the term “child sexual
115 abuse material” in accordance with section 30.
