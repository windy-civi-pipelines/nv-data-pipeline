SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to the crime of unlawful dissemination
of an intimate image. (BDR 15-776)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to crimes; expanding the crime of unlawful dissemination of an
intimate image to include certain acts relating to the distribution of
certain photorealistic images, digital images, computer images and
computer-generated images; [expanding] providing an exception to
the crime of unlawful dissemination of an intimate image for
persons who are less than 18 years of age; revising the definition of
“intimate image”; providing penalties; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes the crime of unlawful dissemination of an intimate image and
2 provides that a person who unlawfully disseminates an intimate image of a person is guilty of
3 a category D felony. (NRS 200.780) Under existing law, a person is also guilty of a category
4 D felony if the person makes certain demands from a person in exchange for removing an
5 intimate image from public view. (NRS 200.785) Section 1 of this bill expands the definition
6 of “intimate image” for the purpose of these provisions to include certain photorealistic
7 images, digital images, computer images and computer-generated images. (NRS 200.770)
8 Section 1 also eliminates an exception under existing law that excludes from the
9 definition of “intimate image” an image depicting a public figure.
10 Under existing law, a person commits the crime of unlawful dissemination of an intimate
11 image when, with the intent to harass, harm or terrorize another person, the person
12 electronically disseminates or sells an intimate image which depicts the other person and the
13 other person: (1) did not give prior consent to the electronic dissemination or sale; (2) had a
14 reasonable expectation that the intimate image would be kept private and would not be made
15 visible to the public; and (3) was at least 18 years of age when the intimate image was created.
16 (NRS 200.780) Section 2 of this bill [additionally] expands the scope of the crime to also
17 include the distribution of certain photorealistic images, digital images, computer images
18 and computer-generated images. Specifically, section 2 provides that a person [who is 18
19 years of age or older] commits the crime of unlawful dissemination of an intimate image
20 when, with the intent to harass, harm or terrorize another person, the person knowingly
21 distributes or causes to be distributed an intimate image if: (1) the image [or representation] is
22 created in a way that would lead a reasonable person to believe it is an actual depiction of the
23 person depicted; and (2) the other person did not give prior consent to the distribution of the
24 image. Section 2 further provides that the prohibition against disseminating an intimate
Assembly Amendment No. 651 to Senate Bill No. 213 First Reprint Page 4
25 image, both under existing law and as expanded by section 2, does not apply if the
26 person who commits the violation is less than 18 years of age.
