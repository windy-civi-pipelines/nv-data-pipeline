SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to the crime of unlawful
dissemination of an intimate image. (BDR 15-776)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to crimes; expanding the crime of unlawful
dissemination of an intimate image to include certain acts
relating to the distribution of certain photorealistic
images, digital images, electronic images, computer
images, computer-generated images and other pictorial
representations; expanding the definition of “intimate
image”; providing that the crime of unlawful
dissemination of an intimate image constitutes a sexual
offense for the purposes of various statutes; providing
penalties; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes the crime of unlawful dissemination of an intimate
2 image and provides that a person who unlawfully disseminates an intimate image of
3 a person is guilty of a category D felony. (NRS 200.780) Under existing law, a
4 person is also guilty of a category D felony if the person makes certain demands
5 from a person in exchange for removing an intimate image from public view. (NRS
6 200.785) Section 1 of this bill expands the definition of “intimate image” for the
7 purpose of these provisions to include certain photorealistic images, digital images,
8 electronic images, computer images, computer-generated images and other pictorial
9 representations. (NRS 200.770)
10 Under existing law, a person commits the crime of unlawful dissemination of
11 an intimate image when, with the intent to harass, harm or terrorize another person,
12 the person electronically disseminates or sells an intimate image which depicts the
13 other person and the other person: (1) did not give prior consent to the electronic
14 dissemination or sale; (2) had a reasonable expectation that the intimate image
15 would be kept private and would not be made visible to the public; and (3) was at
16 least 18 years of age when the intimate image was created. (NRS 200.780)
-
*SB213*
– 2 –
17 Section 2 of this bill additionally provides that a person who is 18 years of age or
18 older commits the crime of unlawful dissemination of an intimate image when, with
19 the intent to harass, harm or terrorize another person, the person distributes or
20 causes to be distributed an intimate image if: (1) the image or representation is
21 created in a way that would lead a reasonable person to believe it is an actual
22 depiction of the person depicted; and (2) the other person did not give prior consent
23 to the distribution of the image.
24 Existing law defines the term “sexual offense” for the purpose of requiring
25 persons convicted of certain sexual offenses to be prohibited from certain
26 employment, to register as a sex offender, to comply with certain mandatory
27 conditions of probation or parole and to fulfill certain other requirements. (NRS
28 118A.335, 176.0913, 176A.410, 179D.095, 179D.097, 179D.441, 213.1099,
29 213.1245) Section 3 of this bill revises the list of sexual offenses to which these
30 statutory provisions apply to include unlawful dissemination of an intimate image
31 pursuant to section 2. Section 2 makes a conforming change by eliminating
32 provisions of existing law which provide that a person who commits the crime of
33 unlawful dissemination of an intimate image is not considered a sex offender and is
34 not subject to registration or community notification as a sex offender.
