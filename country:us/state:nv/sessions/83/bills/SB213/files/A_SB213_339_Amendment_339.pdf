EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to crimes; expanding the crime of unlawful dissemination of an
intimate image to include certain acts relating to the distribution of
certain photorealistic images, digital images, [electronic images,]
computer images [,] and computer-generated images ; [and other
pictorial representations;] expanding the definition of “intimate
image”; [providing that the crime of unlawful dissemination of an
intimate image constitutes a sexual offense for the purposes of various
statutes;] providing penalties; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes the crime of unlawful dissemination of an intimate image and
2 provides that a person who unlawfully disseminates an intimate image of a person is guilty of
3 a category D felony. (NRS 200.780) Under existing law, a person is also guilty of a category
4 D felony if the person makes certain demands from a person in exchange for removing an
5 intimate image from public view. (NRS 200.785) Section 1 of this bill expands the definition
6 of “intimate image” for the purpose of these provisions to include certain photorealistic
7 images, digital images, [electronic images,] computer images [,] and computer-generated
8 images . [and other pictorial representations.] (NRS 200.770)
9 Under existing law, a person commits the crime of unlawful dissemination of an intimate
10 image when, with the intent to harass, harm or terrorize another person, the person
11 electronically disseminates or sells an intimate image which depicts the other person and the
12 other person: (1) did not give prior consent to the electronic dissemination or sale; (2) had a
13 reasonable expectation that the intimate image would be kept private and would not be made
14 visible to the public; and (3) was at least 18 years of age when the intimate image was created.
15 (NRS 200.780) Section 2 of this bill additionally provides that a person who is 18 years of age
16 or older commits the crime of unlawful dissemination of an intimate image when, with the
17 intent to harass, harm or terrorize another person, the person knowingly distributes or causes
18 to be distributed an intimate image if: (1) the image or representation is created in a way that
19 would lead a reasonable person to believe it is an actual depiction of the person depicted; and
20 (2) the other person did not give prior consent to the distribution of the image.
21 [Existing law defines the term “sexual offense” for the purpose of requiring persons
22 convicted of certain sexual offenses to be prohibited from certain employment, to register as a

Senate Amendment No. 339 to Senate Bill No. 213 Page 4
23 sex offender, to comply with certain mandatory conditions of probation or parole and to fulfill
24 certain other requirements. (NRS 118A.335, 176.0913, 176A.410, 179D.095, 179D.097,
25 179D.441, 213.1099, 213.1245) Section 3 of this bill revises the list of sexual offenses to
26 which these statutory provisions apply to include unlawful dissemination of an intimate image
27 pursuant to section 2. Section 2 makes a conforming change by eliminating provisions of
28 existing law which provide that a person who commits the crime of unlawful dissemination of
29 an intimate image is not considered a sex offender and is not subject to registration or
30 community notification as a sex offender. (NRS 200.780)]
