Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes the crime of unlawful dissemination of an intimate
2 image and provides that a person who unlawfully disseminates an intimate image of
3 a person is guilty of a category D felony. (NRS 200.780) Under existing law, a
4 person is also guilty of a category D felony if the person makes certain demands
5 from a person in exchange for removing an intimate image from public view. (NRS
6 200.785) Section 1 of this bill expands the definition of “intimate image” for the
7 purpose of these provisions to include certain photorealistic images, digital images,
8 computer images and computer-generated images. (NRS 200.770)
9 Under existing law, a person commits the crime of unlawful dissemination of
10 an intimate image when, with the intent to harass, harm or terrorize another person,
11 the person electronically disseminates or sells an intimate image which depicts the
12 other person and the other person: (1) did not give prior consent to the electronic
13 dissemination or sale; (2) had a reasonable expectation that the intimate image
14 would be kept private and would not be made visible to the public; and (3) was at
15 least 18 years of age when the intimate image was created. (NRS 200.780) Section
16 2 of this bill additionally provides that a person who is 18 years of age or older
17 commits the crime of unlawful dissemination of an intimate image when, with the
18 intent to harass, harm or terrorize another person, the person knowingly distributes
19 or causes to be distributed an intimate image if: (1) the image or representation is
20 created in a way that would lead a reasonable person to believe it is an actual
