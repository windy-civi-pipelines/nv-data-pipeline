of the Council; prescribing the duties of the Council;

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates the Department of Native American Affairs, which
2 consists of the Executive Director, the Nevada Indian Commission and the Stewart
3 Indian School Cultural Center and Museum. (NRS 233A.1003) Section 5 of this
4 bill creates the Tribal Health Authority Council and establishes the membership of
5 the Council. Section 4 of this bill defines the term “Council” to refer to the Council
6 for the purposes of sections 4-9 of this bill. Section 6 of this bill: (1) establishes
7 certain requirements governing the operation of the Council; (2) authorizes a
8 member of the Council to participate through a remote technology system; and (3)
9 provides for the election of the officers of the Council. Section 7 authorizes the
10 Executive Director to appoint a Coordinator of the Council. Section 7 also requires
11 the Department to provide any additional personnel, facilities, equipment and
-

12 supplies to the Council. Section 8 of this bill prescribes the duties of the Council,
13 which include adopting and periodically updating a plan to increase access to health
14 care and address and eliminate barriers to health care for American Indians in this
15 State. Section 1.5 of this bill authorizes the Council to request the drafting of not
16 more than 2 legislative measures which relate to matters within the scope of the
17 Council. Section 1.8 of this bill subjects those requests to certain provisions that
18 apply to requests for the drafting of legislation that are submitted by nonlegislative
19 requesters. Section 9 of this bill creates the Account for Tribal Health to fund the
20 activities of the Council, and section 10 of this bill appropriates money to the
21 Account. Section 11 of this bill requires the Director of the Department of Health
22 and Human Services to collaborate with the Council to develop a proposal to
23 establish a program to reinvest certain federal funds received by this State under the
24 Medicaid program.
25 Existing law requires the Department of Health and Human Services to
26 administer Medicaid. (NRS 422.270) Additionally, existing federal law requires the
27 Secretary of Health and Human Services to encourage enrollment of American
28 Indians in Medicaid. (42 U.S.C. § 1320b-9) To the extent authorized by federal
29 law, section 1 of this bill authorizes an Indian tribe to determine whether a person
30 is presumptively eligible to receive benefits under Medicaid. Section 1 requires the
31 Department to apply for any waiver of federal law or apply for any amendment to
32 the State Plan for Medicaid to authorize an Indian tribe to make such
33 determinations. Section 1 additionally requires the Department to provide to each
34 Indian tribe that determines presumptive eligibility the resources, training and
35 technical assistance necessary for the Indian tribe to accurately and effectively
36 determine if a person is presumptively eligible to receive benefits under Medicaid.
37 Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to indicate that the provisions of
38 section 1 will be administered in the same manner as the provisions of existing law
39 governing Medicaid.
