3 Indian School Cultural Center and Museum. (NRS 233A.1003) Section 5 of this
4 bill creates the Tribal Health Authority Council and establishes the membership of
5 the Council. Section 4 of this bill defines the term “Council” to refer to the Council

7 requirements governing the operation of the Council and provides for the election

9 the Coordinator of the Council. Section 7 also requires the Department to provide
10 any additional personnel, facilities, equipment and supplies to the Council. Section
11 8 of this bill prescribes the duties of the Council, which include adopting and
12 periodically updating a plan to increase access to health care and address and
13 eliminate barriers to health care for American Indians, Alaska Natives and Native
14 Hawaiians in this State. Section 9 of this bill creates the Account for Tribal Health
15 to fund the activities of the Council, and section 10 of this bill appropriates money
16 to the Account. Section 11 of this bill requires the Director of the Department of
17 Health and Human Services to collaborate with the Council to develop a proposal
18 to establish a program to reinvest certain federal funds received by this State under
19 the Medicaid program.
20 Existing law requires the Department of Health and Human Services to
21 administer Medicaid. (NRS 422.270) Additionally, existing federal law requires the
22 Secretary of Health and Human Services to encourage enrollment of American
23 Indians in Medicaid. (42 U.S.C. § 1320b-9) Section 1 of this bill requires the
24 Department to apply for any waiver of federal law or apply for any amendment to
25 the State Plan for Medicaid to authorize certain trained persons affiliated with
26 tribes, known as tribal health benefit coordinators, to determine whether a person is
27 eligible to receive benefits under Medicaid. Section 1 additionally requires the
28 Department to collaborate with the Council and tribal health clinics in this State to
29 ensure that tribal health benefit coordinators have the resources necessary to
30 determine if a person is eligible to receive benefits under Medicaid. Section 2 of
31 this bill makes a conforming change to indicate that the provisions of section 1 will
32 be administered in the same manner as the provisions of existing law governing
33 Medicaid.
