Senate Bill No. 312–Committee on
Health and Human Services
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to health care; authorizing Indian tribes to
determine if a person is presumptively eligible for Medicaid;
creating the Tribal Health Authority Council; prescribing the
procedure governing the operations of the Council;
authorizing the appointment of the Coordinator of the
Council; prescribing the duties of the Council; creating the
Account for Tribal Health; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law creates the Department of Native American Affairs, which
consists of the Executive Director, the Nevada Indian Commission and the Stewart
Indian School Cultural Center and Museum. (NRS 233A.1003) Section 5 of this
bill creates the Tribal Health Authority Council and establishes the membership of
the Council. Section 4 of this bill defines the term “Council” to refer to the Council
for the purposes of sections 4-9 of this bill. Section 6 of this bill: (1) establishes
certain requirements governing the operation of the Council; (2) authorizes a
member of the Council to participate through a remote technology system; and (3)
provides for the election of the officers of the Council. Section 7 authorizes the
Executive Director to appoint a Coordinator of the Council. Section 7 also requires
the Department to provide any additional personnel, facilities, equipment and
supplies to the Council. Section 8 of this bill prescribes the duties of the Council,
which include adopting and periodically updating a plan to increase access to health
care and address and eliminate barriers to health care for American Indians in this
State. Section 1.5 of this bill authorizes the Council to request the drafting of not
more than 2 legislative measures which relate to matters within the scope of the
Council. Section 1.8 of this bill subjects those requests to certain provisions that
apply to requests for the drafting of legislation that are submitted by nonlegislative
requesters. Section 9 of this bill creates the Account for Tribal Health to fund the
activities of the Council. Section 11 of this bill requires the Director of the
Department of Health and Human Services to collaborate with the Council to
develop a proposal to establish a program to reinvest certain federal funds received
by this State under the Medicaid program.
Existing law requires the Department of Health and Human Services to
administer Medicaid. (NRS 422.270) Additionally, existing federal law requires the
Secretary of Health and Human Services to encourage enrollment of American
Indians in Medicaid. (42 U.S.C. § 1320b-9) To the extent authorized by federal
law, section 1 of this bill authorizes an Indian tribe to determine whether a person
is presumptively eligible to receive benefits under Medicaid. Section 1 requires the
Department to apply for any waiver of federal law or apply for any amendment to
the State Plan for Medicaid to authorize an Indian tribe to make such
determinations. Section 1 additionally requires the Department to provide to each
Indian tribe that determines presumptive eligibility the resources, training and
technical assistance necessary for the Indian tribe to accurately and effectively
determine if a person is presumptively eligible to receive benefits under Medicaid.
Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to indicate that the provisions of
-

section 1 will be administered in the same manner as the provisions of existing law
governing Medicaid.
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
