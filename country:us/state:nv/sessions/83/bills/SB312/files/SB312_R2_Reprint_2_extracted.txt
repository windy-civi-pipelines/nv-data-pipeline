prescribing the procedure governing the operations of the

15 State. Section 1.5 of this bill authorizes the Council to request the drafting of not
16 more than 2 legislative measures which relate to matters within the scope of the
17 Council. Section 1.8 of this bill subjects those requests to certain provisions that
18 apply to requests for the drafting of legislation that are submitted by nonlegislative
19 requesters. Section 9 of this bill creates the Account for Tribal Health to fund the
20 activities of the Council. Section 11 of this bill requires the Director of the
21 Department of Health and Human Services to collaborate with the Council to
22 develop a proposal to establish a program to reinvest certain federal funds received
23 by this State under the Medicaid program.
24 Existing law requires the Department of Health and Human Services to
25 administer Medicaid. (NRS 422.270) Additionally, existing federal law requires the
26 Secretary of Health and Human Services to encourage enrollment of American
27 Indians in Medicaid. (42 U.S.C. § 1320b-9) To the extent authorized by federal
28 law, section 1 of this bill authorizes an Indian tribe to determine whether a person
29 is presumptively eligible to receive benefits under Medicaid. Section 1 requires the
30 Department to apply for any waiver of federal law or apply for any amendment to
31 the State Plan for Medicaid to authorize an Indian tribe to make such
32 determinations. Section 1 additionally requires the Department to provide to each
33 Indian tribe that determines presumptive eligibility the resources, training and
34 technical assistance necessary for the Indian tribe to accurately and effectively
35 determine if a person is presumptively eligible to receive benefits under Medicaid.
36 Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to indicate that the provisions of
37 section 1 will be administered in the same manner as the provisions of existing law
38 governing Medicaid.

15 State. Section 1.5 of this bill authorizes the Council to request the drafting of not
16 more than 2 legislative measures which relate to matters within the scope of the
17 Council. Section 1.8 of this bill subjects those requests to certain provisions that
18 apply to requests for the drafting of legislation that are submitted by nonlegislative

20 activities of the Council. Section 11 of this bill requires the Director of the

22 develop a proposal to establish a program to reinvest certain federal funds received
23 by this State under the Medicaid program.

33 Indian tribe that determines presumptive eligibility the resources, training and
34 technical assistance necessary for the Indian tribe to accurately and effectively
35 determine if a person is presumptively eligible to receive benefits under Medicaid.
36 Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to indicate that the provisions of
37 section 1 will be administered in the same manner as the provisions of existing law
38 governing Medicaid.
