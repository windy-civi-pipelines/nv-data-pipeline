AN ACT relating to health care; authorizing Indian tribes to determine if a person is
presumptively eligible for Medicaid; creating the Tribal Health
Authority Council; prescribing the procedure governing the operations
of the Council; authorizing the appointment of the Coordinator of the
Council; prescribing the duties of the Council; creating the Account for
Tribal Health; [making an appropriation to the Department of Native
American Affairs for the personnel and operating costs of the Council;]
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates the Department of Native American Affairs, which consists of the
2 Executive Director, the Nevada Indian Commission and the Stewart Indian School Cultural
3 Center and Museum. (NRS 233A.1003) Section 5 of this bill creates the Tribal Health
4 Authority Council and establishes the membership of the Council. Section 4 of this bill
5 defines the term “Council” to refer to the Council for the purposes of sections 4-9 of this bill.
6 Section 6 of this bill: (1) establishes certain requirements governing the operation of the
7 Council; (2) authorizes a member of the Council to participate through a remote technology
8 system; and (3) provides for the election of the officers of the Council. Section 7 authorizes
9 the Executive Director to appoint a Coordinator of the Council. Section 7 also requires the
10 Department to provide any additional personnel, facilities, equipment and supplies to the
11 Council. Section 8 of this bill prescribes the duties of the Council, which include adopting and
12 periodically updating a plan to increase access to health care and address and eliminate
13 barriers to health care for American Indians in this State. Section 1.5 of this bill authorizes the
14 Council to request the drafting of not more than 2 legislative measures which relate to matters
15 within the scope of the Council. Section 1.8 of this bill subjects those requests to certain
16 provisions that apply to requests for the drafting of legislation that are submitted by
17 nonlegislative requesters. Section 9 of this bill creates the Account for Tribal Health to fund
18 the activities of the Council . [, and section 10 of this bill appropriates money to the Account.]
19 Section 11 of this bill requires the Director of the Department of Health and Human Services
Senate Amendment No. 755 to Senate Bill No. 312 First Reprint Page 4
20 to collaborate with the Council to develop a proposal to establish a program to reinvest certain
21 federal funds received by this State under the Medicaid program.
22 Existing law requires the Department of Health and Human Services to administer
23 Medicaid. (NRS 422.270) Additionally, existing federal law requires the Secretary of Health
24 and Human Services to encourage enrollment of American Indians in Medicaid. (42 U.S.C. §
25 1320b-9) To the extent authorized by federal law, section 1 of this bill authorizes an Indian
26 tribe to determine whether a person is presumptively eligible to receive benefits under
27 Medicaid. Section 1 requires the Department to apply for any waiver of federal law or apply
28 for any amendment to the State Plan for Medicaid to authorize an Indian tribe to make such
29 determinations. Section 1 additionally requires the Department to provide to each Indian tribe
30 that determines presumptive eligibility the resources, training and technical assistance
31 necessary for the Indian tribe to accurately and effectively determine if a person is
32 presumptively eligible to receive benefits under Medicaid. Section 2 of this bill makes a
33 conforming change to indicate that the provisions of section 1 will be administered in the
34 same manner as the provisions of existing law governing Medicaid.

21 federal funds received by this State under the Medicaid program.
22 Existing law requires the Department of Health and Human Services to administer
23 Medicaid. (NRS 422.270) Additionally, existing federal law requires the Secretary of Health
24 and Human Services to encourage enrollment of American Indians in Medicaid. (42 U.S.C. §
25 1320b-9) To the extent authorized by federal law, section 1 of this bill authorizes an Indian
26 tribe to determine whether a person is presumptively eligible to receive benefits under
27 Medicaid. Section 1 requires the Department to apply for any waiver of federal law or apply
28 for any amendment to the State Plan for Medicaid to authorize an Indian tribe to make such
29 determinations. Section 1 additionally requires the Department to provide to each Indian tribe
30 that determines presumptive eligibility the resources, training and technical assistance
31 necessary for the Indian tribe to accurately and effectively determine if a person is
32 presumptively eligible to receive benefits under Medicaid. Section 2 of this bill makes a
33 conforming change to indicate that the provisions of section 1 will be administered in the
34 same manner as the provisions of existing law governing Medicaid.
