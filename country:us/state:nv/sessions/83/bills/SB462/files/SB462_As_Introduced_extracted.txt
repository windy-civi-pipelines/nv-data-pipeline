provisions relating to the preparation of the budget of the
Executive Department of the State Government; revising
provisions governing the Account to Stabilize the
Operation of the State Government; revising provisions
relating to the preparation of the statewide cost allocation

thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 The State Budget Act sets forth the process for the preparation and submission
2 of the proposed biennial budget for the Executive Department of the State
3 Government. (NRS 353.150-353.246) In part, the Act requires the Chief of the
4 Budget Division of the Office of Finance to provide to the Fiscal Analysis Division
5 of the Legislative Counsel Bureau each agency’s adjusted base budget by program
6 or budgetary account for the next 2 fiscal years. (NRS 353.211) The Act also
7 requires the Chief to prepare a final version of the proposed budget, which is
8 required to include the adjusted base budget for each department, institution and
9 agency of the Executive Department. (NRS 353.230) Existing law defines the term
10 “adjusted base budget” to mean the amount appropriated or authorized to support
11 ongoing expenditures budgeted to the department, institution or agency by the
12 Legislature for the second year of the current biennium, as adjusted for: (1) the
13 removal of any one-time appropriation or authorization that was appropriated or
14 authorized by the Legislature to the department, institution or agency for the second
15 year of the biennium; (2) statewide fringe benefits, assessments, rent, insurance
16 premiums and cost allocations; (3) contractual obligations that are approved or
17 expired during the current biennium; (4) ongoing expenditures approved by the
-

– 2 –
18 Interim Finance Committee during the current biennium; (5) any annualization of
19 costs that occurred for part of the second year of the current biennium; (6) actual
20 caseloads incurred during the first year of the biennium; (7) rate changes that are
21 projected to affect the budget of the department, institution or agency during the
22 next biennium; and (8) any other adjustment that is necessary based on the limit
23 upon total proposed expenditures or as otherwise determined by the Chief. (NRS
24 353.211, 353.230) Sections 1 and 2 of this bill revise the adjustments that are
25 authorized to be made to an agency’s base budget for purposes of these provisions.
26 Under existing law, the Account to Stabilize the Operation of the State
27 Government, also known as the Rainy Day Account, is an account created in the
28 State General Fund into which surplus state revenues are required to be transferred
29 annually to be used in case of fiscal emergencies. Such a transfer is required to
30 occur after the close of the previous fiscal year and before the issuance of the State
31 Controller’s annual report. The balance in the Account is prohibited from
32 exceeding 26 percent of the total of all appropriations from the State General Fund
33 for the operation of all departments, institutions and agencies of the State
34 Government and for the funding of schools and authorized expenditures from the
35 State General Fund for the regulation of gaming for the fiscal year in which the
36 revenue will be transferred to the Account. (NRS 353.288) Section 3 of this bill
37 changes the measurement for this limitation on the balance of the Account from the
38 total of such appropriations and authorized expenditures for the fiscal year in which
39 the revenue will be transferred to the Account to the total of such appropriations
40 and authorized expenditures for the previous fiscal year.
41 Under existing law, the Administrator of the Administrative Services Division
42 of the Department of Administration is required to prepare annually a statewide
43 cost allocation plan that distributes the indirect costs of service agencies among the
44 agencies of the Executive Department of the State Government. (NRS 353.331)
45 Section 4 of this bill transfers this duty to the Chief of the Budget Division of the
46 Office of Finance.

26 Under existing law, the Account to Stabilize the Operation of the State
27 Government, also known as the Rainy Day Account, is an account created in the
28 State General Fund into which surplus state revenues are required to be transferred
29 annually to be used in case of fiscal emergencies. Such a transfer is required to
30 occur after the close of the previous fiscal year and before the issuance of the State
31 Controller’s annual report. The balance in the Account is prohibited from
32 exceeding 26 percent of the total of all appropriations from the State General Fund
33 for the operation of all departments, institutions and agencies of the State
34 Government and for the funding of schools and authorized expenditures from the
35 State General Fund for the regulation of gaming for the fiscal year in which the
36 revenue will be transferred to the Account. (NRS 353.288) Section 3 of this bill
37 changes the measurement for this limitation on the balance of the Account from the
38 total of such appropriations and authorized expenditures for the fiscal year in which
39 the revenue will be transferred to the Account to the total of such appropriations
40 and authorized expenditures for the previous fiscal year.
41 Under existing law, the Administrator of the Administrative Services Division
42 of the Department of Administration is required to prepare annually a statewide
43 cost allocation plan that distributes the indirect costs of service agencies among the
44 agencies of the Executive Department of the State Government. (NRS 353.331)
45 Section 4 of this bill transfers this duty to the Chief of the Budget Division of the
46 Office of Finance.
