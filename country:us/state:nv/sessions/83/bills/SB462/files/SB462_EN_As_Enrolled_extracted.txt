Executive Department of the State Government; revising
provisions governing the Account to Stabilize the Operation
of the State Government; revising provisions relating to the

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
The State Budget Act sets forth the process for the preparation and submission
of the proposed biennial budget for the Executive Department of the State
Government. (NRS 353.150-353.246) In part, the Act requires the Chief of the
Budget Division of the Office of Finance to provide to the Fiscal Analysis Division
of the Legislative Counsel Bureau each agency’s adjusted base budget by program
or budgetary account for the next 2 fiscal years. (NRS 353.211) The Act also
requires the Chief to prepare a final version of the proposed budget, which is
required to include the adjusted base budget for each department, institution and
agency of the Executive Department. (NRS 353.230) Existing law defines the term
“adjusted base budget” to mean the amount appropriated or authorized to support
ongoing expenditures budgeted to the department, institution or agency by the
Legislature for the second year of the current biennium, as adjusted for: (1) the
removal of any one-time appropriation or authorization that was appropriated or
authorized by the Legislature to the department, institution or agency for the second
year of the biennium; (2) statewide fringe benefits, assessments, rent, insurance
premiums and cost allocations; (3) contractual obligations that are approved or
expired during the current biennium; (4) ongoing expenditures approved by the
Interim Finance Committee during the current biennium; (5) any annualization of
costs that occurred for part of the second year of the current biennium; (6) actual
caseloads incurred during the first year of the biennium; (7) rate changes that are
projected to affect the budget of the department, institution or agency during the
next biennium; and (8) any other adjustment that is necessary based on the limit
upon total proposed expenditures or as otherwise determined by the Chief. (NRS

Section 2:
353.211, 353.230) Sections 1 and 2 of this bill revise the adjustments that are
authorized to be made to an agency’s base budget for purposes of these provisions.
Under existing law, the Account to Stabilize the Operation of the State
Government, also known as the Rainy Day Account, is an account created in the
State General Fund into which surplus state revenues are required to be transferred
annually to be used in case of fiscal emergencies. Such a transfer is required to
occur after the close of the previous fiscal year and before the issuance of the State
Controller’s annual report. The balance in the Account is prohibited from
exceeding 26 percent of the total of all appropriations from the State General Fund
for the operation of all departments, institutions and agencies of the State
Government and for the funding of schools and authorized expenditures from the
State General Fund for the regulation of gaming for the fiscal year in which the
revenue will be transferred to the Account. (NRS 353.288) Section 3 of this bill
changes the measurement for this limitation on the balance of the Account from the
total of such appropriations and authorized expenditures for the fiscal year in which
the revenue will be transferred to the Account to the total of such appropriations
and authorized expenditures for the previous fiscal year.

Senate Bill No. 462–Committee on Finance
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to state financial administration; revising
provisions relating to the preparation of the budget of the
Executive Department of the State Government; revising
provisions governing the Account to Stabilize the Operation
of the State Government; revising provisions relating to the
preparation of the statewide cost allocation plan; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
The State Budget Act sets forth the process for the preparation and submission
of the proposed biennial budget for the Executive Department of the State
Government. (NRS 353.150-353.246) In part, the Act requires the Chief of the
Budget Division of the Office of Finance to provide to the Fiscal Analysis Division
of the Legislative Counsel Bureau each agency’s adjusted base budget by program
or budgetary account for the next 2 fiscal years. (NRS 353.211) The Act also
requires the Chief to prepare a final version of the proposed budget, which is
required to include the adjusted base budget for each department, institution and
agency of the Executive Department. (NRS 353.230) Existing law defines the term
“adjusted base budget” to mean the amount appropriated or authorized to support
ongoing expenditures budgeted to the department, institution or agency by the
Legislature for the second year of the current biennium, as adjusted for: (1) the
removal of any one-time appropriation or authorization that was appropriated or
authorized by the Legislature to the department, institution or agency for the second
year of the biennium; (2) statewide fringe benefits, assessments, rent, insurance
premiums and cost allocations; (3) contractual obligations that are approved or
expired during the current biennium; (4) ongoing expenditures approved by the
Interim Finance Committee during the current biennium; (5) any annualization of
costs that occurred for part of the second year of the current biennium; (6) actual
caseloads incurred during the first year of the biennium; (7) rate changes that are
projected to affect the budget of the department, institution or agency during the
next biennium; and (8) any other adjustment that is necessary based on the limit
upon total proposed expenditures or as otherwise determined by the Chief. (NRS
353.211, 353.230) Sections 1 and 2 of this bill revise the adjustments that are
authorized to be made to an agency’s base budget for purposes of these provisions.
Under existing law, the Account to Stabilize the Operation of the State
Government, also known as the Rainy Day Account, is an account created in the
State General Fund into which surplus state revenues are required to be transferred
annually to be used in case of fiscal emergencies. Such a transfer is required to
occur after the close of the previous fiscal year and before the issuance of the State
Controller’s annual report. The balance in the Account is prohibited from
exceeding 26 percent of the total of all appropriations from the State General Fund
for the operation of all departments, institutions and agencies of the State
Government and for the funding of schools and authorized expenditures from the
State General Fund for the regulation of gaming for the fiscal year in which the
revenue will be transferred to the Account. (NRS 353.288) Section 3 of this bill
changes the measurement for this limitation on the balance of the Account from the
total of such appropriations and authorized expenditures for the fiscal year in which
the revenue will be transferred to the Account to the total of such appropriations
and authorized expenditures for the previous fiscal year.
