Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, the State of Nevada is prohibited from donating or loaning
2 state money or credit, or subscribing to or being interested in the stock of any
3 company, association or corporation, except a corporation that is formed for
4 educational or charitable purposes. (Nev. Const. Art. 8, § 9) Existing law requires
5 the State Treasurer to form an independent corporation for public benefit, the
6 purpose of which is to act as a limited partner of limited partnerships or a
7 shareholder or member of limited-liability companies that provide private equity
8 funding to businesses that are located in this State or seeking to locate to this State
9 and engage primarily in certain industries. (NRS 355.270) Under existing law, the
10 State Treasurer is prohibited from making certain investments of money in the State
11 Permanent School Fund unless the State Treasurer obtains a judicial determination
12 that such an investment does not violate the prohibition in the Nevada Constitution
13 against the State of Nevada donating or loaning state money or credit, or
14 subscribing to or being interested in the stock of any company, association or
15 corporation, except a corporation that is formed for educational or charitable
16 purposes. (Nev. Const. Art. 8, § 9; NRS 355.060) Upon obtaining a judicial
17 determination that an investment does not violate the Nevada Constitution, existing
18 law authorizes the State Treasurer to transfer up to $75,000,000 from the State
-

19 Permanent School Fund to the corporation for public benefit and requires the
20 corporation by agreement to provide more than 50 percent of all private equity
21 funding to businesses engaged in specified industries that are located or seeking to
22 locate in Nevada. (NRS 355.280) Existing law authorizes the money transferred
23 from the State Permanent School Fund to the corporation for public benefit to be
24 used to make venture capital investments. (NRS 355.275)
25 Sections 2 and 4 of this bill eliminate the restriction that the businesses in
26 which the corporation for public benefit is authorized to invest engage primarily in
27 certain industries. Section 1 of this bill instead requires that the business be
28 engaged in an industry that is consistent with the State Plan for Economic
29 Development, which the Executive Director of the Office of Economic
30 Development within the Office of the Governor is required to develop under
31 existing law. (NRS 231.053) Section 1 also: (1) clarifies the circumstances in
32 which a business is located or seeking to locate in Nevada; and (2) requires that the
33 businesses be seeking early-stage or middle-stage investments to commence or
34 expand operations. Section 5 of this bill makes a conforming change relating to the
35 revised criteria for eligible businesses. Section 2 also provides that, in addition to
36 the money transferred from the State Permanent School Fund, any other money
37 received by the corporation for public benefit is authorized to be used for venture
38 capital investments.
39 Existing law establishes the board of directors of the corporation for public
40 benefit and requires the board to consist of the Chancellor of the Nevada System of
41 Higher Education, the State Treasurer, five members from the private sector who
42 have at least 10 years of experience in certain fields appointed by the Governor and
43 legislative leadership and certain additional members who are required to be
44 approved by a majority of certain board members. (NRS 355.270) Section 2: (1)
45 replaces the Chancellor of the Nevada System of Higher Education on the board
46 with the Executive Director of the Office of Economic Development; and (2)
47 changes the experience required for the five appointed members from at least 10
48 years of experience in certain fields to demonstrated experience in those fields.
49 Existing law authorizes the corporation for public benefit to place investments
50 through the use or assistance of external asset managers or private equity
51 investment firms. (NRS 355.275) Existing law also references the board contracting
52 with venture capital investment firms. (NRS 355.270) Section 3 of this bill: (1)
53 authorizes a corporation for public benefit to invest directly in eligible businesses;
54 and (2) clarifies that the board is authorized to place investments though the use or
55 assistance of venture capital investment firms. Section 3 also requires the
56 corporation for public benefit to ensure that private equity money and venture
57 capital investments made directly by the corporation or by external asset managers
58 and private equity or venture capital investment firms are provided in a manner
59 that: (1) ensures diversification among the recipient businesses; (2) gives priority to
60 eligible businesses that meet specified criteria; (3) allows businesses to create new
61 job opportunities; and (4) supports new, emerging and expanding businesses in this
62 State.
63 Existing law authorizes the State Treasurer to adopt regulations which include
64 criteria for determining eligibility for and use of private equity funding, subject to
65 certain limitations. (NRS 355.285) Section 5 of this bill expands that specific
66 regulatory authority to also address such criteria for venture capital investments.
67 Sections 6-9 of this bill revise obsolete references to the provisions governing
68 the program administered by the corporation for public benefit to provide private
69 equity funding and venture capital investments to specified businesses.
70 Existing law: (1) provides for the certification of eligible businesses as local
71 emerging small businesses by the Office of Economic Development; and (2)
72 requires the Office to provide to such businesses certain information concerning
73 public and private programs to provide financing to small businesses and the
-
*AB427_R1*
– 3 –
74 criteria for obtaining financing through such programs. (NRS 231.14055) Section 8
75 of this bill revises the scope of the financing programs concerning which the Office
76 is required to provide information to local emerging small businesses to public and
77 private programs that are active or funded, or both, at the time the application for
78 certification of a business is received by the Office.

Referred to Committee on Government Affairs
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to public financial
administration. (BDR 31-739)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public financial administration; revising
provisions governing the program administered by a
corporation for public benefit to provide private equity
funding and venture capital investments to certain
businesses; revising provisions relating to certain
financing information that is required to be provided to
certain small businesses by the Office of Economic
Development; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, the State of Nevada is prohibited from donating or loaning
2 state money or credit, or subscribing to or being interested in the stock of any
3 company, association or corporation, except a corporation that is formed for
4 educational or charitable purposes. (Nev. Const. Art. 8, § 9) Existing law requires
5 the State Treasurer to form an independent corporation for public benefit, the
6 purpose of which is to act as a limited partner of limited partnerships or a
7 shareholder or member of limited-liability companies that provide private equity
8 funding to businesses that are located in this State or seeking to locate to this State
9 and engage primarily in certain industries. (NRS 355.270) Under existing law, the
10 State Treasurer is prohibited from making certain investments of money in the State
11 Permanent School Fund unless the State Treasurer obtains a judicial determination
12 that such an investment does not violate the prohibition in the Nevada Constitution
13 against the State of Nevada donating or loaning state money or credit, or
14 subscribing to or being interested in the stock of any company, association or
15 corporation, except a corporation that is formed for educational or charitable
16 purposes. (Nev. Const. Art. 8, § 9; NRS 355.060) Upon obtaining a judicial
17 determination that an investment does not violate the Nevada Constitution, existing
18 law authorizes the State Treasurer to transfer up to $75,000,000 from the State
-
*AB427_R1*

– 2 –
19 Permanent School Fund to the corporation for public benefit and requires the
20 corporation by agreement to provide more than 50 percent of all private equity
21 funding to businesses engaged in specified industries that are located or seeking to
22 locate in Nevada. (NRS 355.280) Existing law authorizes the money transferred
23 from the State Permanent School Fund to the corporation for public benefit to be
24 used to make venture capital investments. (NRS 355.275)
25 Sections 2 and 4 of this bill eliminate the restriction that the businesses in
26 which the corporation for public benefit is authorized to invest engage primarily in
27 certain industries. Section 1 of this bill instead requires that the business be
28 engaged in an industry that is consistent with the State Plan for Economic
29 Development, which the Executive Director of the Office of Economic
30 Development within the Office of the Governor is required to develop under
31 existing law. (NRS 231.053) Section 1 also: (1) clarifies the circumstances in
32 which a business is located or seeking to locate in Nevada; and (2) requires that the
33 businesses be seeking early-stage or middle-stage investments to commence or
34 expand operations. Section 5 of this bill makes a conforming change relating to the
35 revised criteria for eligible businesses. Section 2 also provides that, in addition to
36 the money transferred from the State Permanent School Fund, any other money
37 received by the corporation for public benefit is authorized to be used for venture
38 capital investments.
39 Existing law establishes the board of directors of the corporation for public
40 benefit and requires the board to consist of the Chancellor of the Nevada System of
41 Higher Education, the State Treasurer, five members from the private sector who
42 have at least 10 years of experience in certain fields appointed by the Governor and
43 legislative leadership and certain additional members who are required to be
44 approved by a majority of certain board members. (NRS 355.270) Section 2: (1)
45 replaces the Chancellor of the Nevada System of Higher Education on the board
46 with the Executive Director of the Office of Economic Development; and (2)
47 changes the experience required for the five appointed members from at least 10
48 years of experience in certain fields to demonstrated experience in those fields.
49 Existing law authorizes the corporation for public benefit to place investments
50 through the use or assistance of external asset managers or private equity
51 investment firms. (NRS 355.275) Existing law also references the board contracting
52 with venture capital investment firms. (NRS 355.270) Section 3 of this bill: (1)
53 authorizes a corporation for public benefit to invest directly in eligible businesses;
54 and (2) clarifies that the board is authorized to place investments though the use or
55 assistance of venture capital investment firms. Section 3 also requires the
56 corporation for public benefit to ensure that private equity money and venture
57 capital investments made directly by the corporation or by external asset managers
58 and private equity or venture capital investment firms are provided in a manner
59 that: (1) ensures diversification among the recipient businesses; (2) gives priority to
60 eligible businesses that meet specified criteria; (3) allows businesses to create new
61 job opportunities; and (4) supports new, emerging and expanding businesses in this
62 State.
63 Existing law authorizes the State Treasurer to adopt regulations which include
64 criteria for determining eligibility for and use of private equity funding, subject to
65 certain limitations. (NRS 355.285) Section 5 of this bill expands that specific
66 regulatory authority to also address such criteria for venture capital investments.
67 Sections 6-9 of this bill revise obsolete references to the provisions governing
68 the program administered by the corporation for public benefit to provide private
69 equity funding and venture capital investments to specified businesses.
70 Existing law: (1) provides for the certification of eligible businesses as local
71 emerging small businesses by the Office of Economic Development; and (2)
72 requires the Office to provide to such businesses certain information concerning
73 public and private programs to provide financing to small businesses and the
-
*AB427_R1*

– 3 –
74 criteria for obtaining financing through such programs. (NRS 231.14055) Section 8
75 of this bill revises the scope of the financing programs concerning which the Office
76 is required to provide information to local emerging small businesses to public and
77 private programs that are active or funded, or both, at the time the application for
78 certification of a business is received by the Office.
