Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, the State of Nevada is prohibited from donating or loaning state
2 money or credit, or subscribing to or being interested in the stock of any company, association
3 or corporation, except a corporation that is formed for educational or charitable purposes.
4 (Nev. Const. Art. 8, § 9) Existing law requires the State Treasurer to form an independent
5 corporation for public benefit, the purpose of which is to act as a limited partner of limited
6 partnerships or a shareholder or member of limited-liability companies that provide private
7 equity funding to businesses that are located in this State or seeking to locate to this State and
8 engage primarily in certain industries. (NRS 355.270) Under existing law, the State Treasurer
9 is prohibited from making certain investments of money in the State Permanent School Fund
10 unless the State Treasurer obtains a judicial determination that such an investment does not
11 violate the prohibition in the Nevada Constitution against the State of Nevada donating or
12 loaning state money or credit, or subscribing to or being interested in the stock of any
13 company, association or corporation, except a corporation that is formed for educational or
14 charitable purposes. (Nev. Const. Art. 8, § 9; NRS 355.060) Upon obtaining a judicial
15 determination that an investment does not violate the Nevada Constitution, existing law
16 authorizes the State Treasurer to transfer up to $75,000,000 from the State Permanent School
17 Fund to the corporation for public benefit and requires the corporation by agreement to
18 provide more than 50 percent of all private equity funding to businesses engaged in specified
19 industries that are located or seeking to locate in Nevada. (NRS 355.280) Existing law
20 authorizes the money transferred from the State Permanent School Fund to the corporation for
21 public benefit to be used to make venture capital investments. (NRS 355.275)
22 Sections 2 and 4 of this bill eliminate the restriction that the businesses in which the
23 corporation for public benefit is authorized to invest engage primarily in certain industries.
24 Section 1 of this bill instead requires that the business be engaged in an industry that is
25 consistent with the State Plan for Economic Development, which the Executive Director of
Assembly Amendment No. 133 to Assembly Bill No. 427 Page 4
26 the Office of Economic Development within the Office of the Governor is required to develop
27 under existing law. (NRS 231.053) Section 1 also: (1) clarifies the circumstances in which a
28 business is located or seeking to locate in Nevada; and (2) requires that the businesses be
29 seeking early-stage or middle-stage investments to commence or expand operations. Section 5
30 of this bill makes a conforming change relating to the revised criteria for eligible businesses.
31 Section 2 also provides that, in addition to the money transferred from the State Permanent
32 School Fund, any other money received by the corporation for public benefit is authorized to
33 be used for venture capital investments.
34 Existing law establishes the board of directors of the corporation for public benefit and
35 requires the board to consist of the Chancellor of the Nevada System of Higher Education, the
36 State Treasurer, five members from the private sector who have at least 10 years of experience
37 in certain fields appointed by the Governor and legislative leadership and certain additional
38 members who are required to be approved by a majority of certain board members. (NRS
39 355.270) Section 2: (1) replaces the Chancellor of the Nevada System of Higher Education on
40 the board with the Executive Director of the Office of Economic Development; and (2)
41 changes the experience required for the five appointed members from at least 10 years of
42 experience in certain fields to demonstrated experience in those fields.
43 Existing law authorizes the corporation for public benefit to place investments through
44 the use or assistance of external asset managers [and] or private equity investment firms.
45 (NRS 355.275) Existing law also references the board contracting with venture capital
46 investment firms. (NRS 355.270) Section 3 of this bill: (1) authorizes a corporation for public
47 benefit to invest directly in eligible businesses; and (2) clarifies that the board is authorized to
48 place investments though the use or assistance of venture capital investment firms. Section 3
49 also requires the corporation for public benefit to ensure that private equity money and
50 venture capital investments made directly by the corporation or by external asset managers
51 and private equity or venture capital investment firms are provided in a manner that: (1)
52 ensures diversification among the recipient businesses; (2) gives priority to eligible businesses
53 that meet specified criteria; (3) allows businesses to create new job opportunities; and (4)
54 supports new, emerging and expanding businesses in this State.
55 Existing law authorizes the State Treasurer to adopt regulations which include criteria for
56 determining eligibility for and use of private equity funding, subject to certain limitations.
57 (NRS 355.285) Section 5 of this bill expands that specific regulatory authority to also address
58 such criteria for venture capital investments.
59 Sections 6-9 of this bill revise obsolete references to the provisions governing the
60 program administered by the corporation for public benefit to provide private equity funding
61 and venture capital investments to specified businesses.
62 Existing law: (1) provides for the certification of eligible businesses as local
63 emerging small businesses by the Office of Economic Development; and (2) requires the
64 Office to provide to such businesses certain information concerning public and private
65 programs to provide financing to small businesses and the criteria for obtaining
66 financing through such programs. (NRS 231.14055) Section 8 of this bill revises the
67 scope of the financing programs concerning which the Office is required to provide
68 information to local emerging small businesses to public and private programs that are
69 active or funded, or both, at the time the application for certification of a business is
70 received by the Office.

SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to public financial administration.
(BDR 31-739)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public financial administration; revising provisions governing
the program administered by a corporation for public benefit to provide
private equity funding and venture capital investments to certain
businesses; revising provisions relating to certain financing
information that is required to be provided to certain small
businesses by the Office of Economic Development; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, the State of Nevada is prohibited from donating or loaning state
2 money or credit, or subscribing to or being interested in the stock of any company, association
3 or corporation, except a corporation that is formed for educational or charitable purposes.
4 (Nev. Const. Art. 8, § 9) Existing law requires the State Treasurer to form an independent
5 corporation for public benefit, the purpose of which is to act as a limited partner of limited
6 partnerships or a shareholder or member of limited-liability companies that provide private
7 equity funding to businesses that are located in this State or seeking to locate to this State and
8 engage primarily in certain industries. (NRS 355.270) Under existing law, the State Treasurer
9 is prohibited from making certain investments of money in the State Permanent School Fund
10 unless the State Treasurer obtains a judicial determination that such an investment does not
11 violate the prohibition in the Nevada Constitution against the State of Nevada donating or
12 loaning state money or credit, or subscribing to or being interested in the stock of any
13 company, association or corporation, except a corporation that is formed for educational or
14 charitable purposes. (Nev. Const. Art. 8, § 9; NRS 355.060) Upon obtaining a judicial
15 determination that an investment does not violate the Nevada Constitution, existing law
16 authorizes the State Treasurer to transfer up to $75,000,000 from the State Permanent School
17 Fund to the corporation for public benefit and requires the corporation by agreement to
18 provide more than 50 percent of all private equity funding to businesses engaged in specified
19 industries that are located or seeking to locate in Nevada. (NRS 355.280) Existing law
20 authorizes the money transferred from the State Permanent School Fund to the corporation for
21 public benefit to be used to make venture capital investments. (NRS 355.275)
22 Sections 2 and 4 of this bill eliminate the restriction that the businesses in which the
23 corporation for public benefit is authorized to invest engage primarily in certain industries.
24 Section 1 of this bill instead requires that the business be engaged in an industry that is
25 consistent with the State Plan for Economic Development, which the Executive Director of

Assembly Amendment No. 133 to Assembly Bill No. 427 Page 4
26 the Office of Economic Development within the Office of the Governor is required to develop
27 under existing law. (NRS 231.053) Section 1 also: (1) clarifies the circumstances in which a
28 business is located or seeking to locate in Nevada; and (2) requires that the businesses be
29 seeking early-stage or middle-stage investments to commence or expand operations. Section 5
30 of this bill makes a conforming change relating to the revised criteria for eligible businesses.
31 Section 2 also provides that, in addition to the money transferred from the State Permanent
32 School Fund, any other money received by the corporation for public benefit is authorized to
33 be used for venture capital investments.
34 Existing law establishes the board of directors of the corporation for public benefit and
35 requires the board to consist of the Chancellor of the Nevada System of Higher Education, the
36 State Treasurer, five members from the private sector who have at least 10 years of experience
37 in certain fields appointed by the Governor and legislative leadership and certain additional
38 members who are required to be approved by a majority of certain board members. (NRS
39 355.270) Section 2: (1) replaces the Chancellor of the Nevada System of Higher Education on
40 the board with the Executive Director of the Office of Economic Development; and (2)
41 changes the experience required for the five appointed members from at least 10 years of
42 experience in certain fields to demonstrated experience in those fields.
43 Existing law authorizes the corporation for public benefit to place investments through
44 the use or assistance of external asset managers [and] or private equity investment firms.
45 (NRS 355.275) Existing law also references the board contracting with venture capital
46 investment firms. (NRS 355.270) Section 3 of this bill: (1) authorizes a corporation for public
47 benefit to invest directly in eligible businesses; and (2) clarifies that the board is authorized to
48 place investments though the use or assistance of venture capital investment firms. Section 3
49 also requires the corporation for public benefit to ensure that private equity money and
50 venture capital investments made directly by the corporation or by external asset managers
51 and private equity or venture capital investment firms are provided in a manner that: (1)
52 ensures diversification among the recipient businesses; (2) gives priority to eligible businesses
53 that meet specified criteria; (3) allows businesses to create new job opportunities; and (4)
54 supports new, emerging and expanding businesses in this State.
55 Existing law authorizes the State Treasurer to adopt regulations which include criteria for
56 determining eligibility for and use of private equity funding, subject to certain limitations.
57 (NRS 355.285) Section 5 of this bill expands that specific regulatory authority to also address
58 such criteria for venture capital investments.
59 Sections 6-9 of this bill revise obsolete references to the provisions governing the
60 program administered by the corporation for public benefit to provide private equity funding
61 and venture capital investments to specified businesses.
62 Existing law: (1) provides for the certification of eligible businesses as local
63 emerging small businesses by the Office of Economic Development; and (2) requires the
64 Office to provide to such businesses certain information concerning public and private
65 programs to provide financing to small businesses and the criteria for obtaining
66 financing through such programs. (NRS 231.14055) Section 8 of this bill revises the
67 scope of the financing programs concerning which the Office is required to provide
68 information to local emerging small businesses to public and private programs that are
69 active or funded, or both, at the time the application for certification of a business is
70 received by the Office.
