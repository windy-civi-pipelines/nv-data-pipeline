27 1. Solar energy development should be concentrated on
28 previously disturbed public lands, such as lands having heavy
29 anthropogenic disturbance or lands on which there is higher
30 amounts of invasive annuals with no pathway back to a non-
31 invasive plant community; and
32 2. Solar energy development should be sited on public lands
33 identified through consultation and coordination with relevant local
34 and state governmental agencies as being appropriate for such
35 development; and be it further
