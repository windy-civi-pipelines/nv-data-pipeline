Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensure of psychologists by the Board of
2 Psychological Examiners. (NRS 641.160, 641.170, 641.196) The Board also
3 registers psychological assistants, psychological interns and psychological trainees.
4 (NRS 641.226)
5 Section 10 of this bill defines “behavioral health and wellness practitioner” to
6 mean a person who is licensed pursuant to practice behavioral health promotion and
7 prevention. Section 11 of this bill defines “behavioral health promotion and
8 prevention” to mean the supervised clinical use of prevention and early intervention
9 strategies relating to the mental health of a child. Section 20 of this bill applies
10 those definitions to the provisions of existing law governing licensure by the Board.
11 Sections 13-19 and 21-49 of this bill provide for the licensure and regulation of
12 behavioral health and wellness practitioners by the Board. Section 13: (1) requires
13 the Board to adopt certain regulations governing behavioral health and wellness
14 practitioners; and (2) authorizes the Board to accept gifts, grants, donations and
15 other funds to assist in carrying out the provisions relating to behavioral health and
16 wellness practitioners. Section 28 of this bill authorizes the Board to adopt
17 additional regulations governing the practice of behavioral health promotion and
18 prevention. Section 14 authorizes the Board to establish a Behavioral Health
19 and Wellness Practitioner Advisory Group to provide the Board with expertise and
20 assistance relating to the regulation of behavioral health and wellness practitioners.
21 Section 15 prescribes the required qualifications to obtain a license as a behavioral
22 health and wellness practitioner, and section 30 requires an applicant for such a
23 license to undergo a fingerprint-based background check. Sections 16 and 17
24 prescribe procedures relating to the expiration and renewal of such a license.
25 Section 18 authorizes certain providers of health care, including an advanced
26 practice registered nurse who has psychiatric training and experience, to supervise a
27 behavioral health and wellness practitioner. Section 5 of this bill requires the State
28 Board of Nursing to adopt regulations establishing the psychiatric training and
29 experience necessary for an advanced practice registered nurse to provide such
30 supervision. Section 33 establishes the maximum fees for the issuance or renewal
31 of a license to practice behavioral health promotion and prevention.
32 Sections 21-23, 25 and 35-47 make the procedures for the investigation and
33 discipline of psychologists and the grounds for disciplinary action against
34 psychologists also apply to behavioral health and wellness practitioners. Section
35 48: (1) prohibits a person from representing himself or herself as a behavioral
36 health and wellness practitioner unless he or she is licensed as a behavioral health
37 and wellness practitioner; and (2) authorizes certain persons in a course of study to
38 practice behavioral health promotion and prevention to engage in the supervised
39 practice of behavioral health promotion and prevention without a license. Section
40 49 makes the practice of behavioral health promotion and prevention without a
41 license or under a false or assumed name a gross misdemeanor. Section 12 of this
42 bill provides that provisions governing psychologists and persons who provide
43 behavioral health promotion and prevention services do not apply to certain
44 government employees. Section 59 of this bill creates a privilege for certain
45 confidential communications between a patient and a behavioral health and
46 wellness practitioner that is similar to existing privileges for such communications
47 with other providers of behavioral health care. (NRS 49.207-49.254, 49.290)
48 Sections 19, 24, 26, 31 and 32 make conforming changes to include behavioral
49 health and wellness practitioners within existing provisions where appropriate and
50 exclude behavioral health and wellness practitioners from existing provisions that
51 apply only to psychologists. Sections 1-4, 6, 34, 50, 52, 54, 56-58 and 60-62 of this
52 bill make various revisions to treat behavioral health and wellness practitioners in
53 the same manner as other similar providers of health care in certain circumstances.
54 Section 7 of this bill clarifies that a music therapist is not authorized to practice

55 behavioral health promotion and prevention. Sections 8, 51, 53 and 55 of this bill
56 provide that a behavioral health and wellness practitioner acting within his or her
57 scope of practice is not violating provisions governing certain other providers of
58 health care.
59 Existing law requires public and private policies of health insurance regulated
60 under Nevada law to include certain coverage. (NRS 287.010, 287.04335,
61 422.27172-422.272428, 689A.04033-689A.0465, 689B.0303-689B.0379,
62 689C.1652-689C.169, 689C.194, 689C.1945, 689C.195, 689C.425, 695A.184-
63 695A.1875, 695A.265, 695B.1901-695B.1948, 695C.050, 695C.1691-695C.176,
64 695G.162-695G.177) Existing law also requires employers to provide certain
65 benefits for health care to employees, including the coverage required of health
66 insurers, if the employer provides health benefits for its employees. (NRS
67 608.1555) Sections 66, 74, 75 and 77 of this bill require Medicaid and the
68 Children’s Health Insurance Program to include coverage for behavioral health
69 promotion and prevention services provided by a behavioral health and wellness
70 practitioner by January 1, 2026. Sections 64, 65, 67, 69-73, 78 and 79 of this bill
71 require other public and private health insurers to provide such coverage and
72 include behavioral health and wellness practitioners in their networks by July 1,
73 2026. Section 63 of this bill makes a conforming change to require the Director of
74 the Department of Health and Human Services to administer the provisions of
75 section 66 in the same manner as other provisions relating to Medicaid. Section 68
76 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner of Insurance to require certain policies of
77 health insurance issued by a domestic insurer to a person who resides in another
78 state to include the coverage required by section 67. Section 76 of this bill
79 authorizes the Commissioner to suspend or revoke the certificate of a health
80 maintenance organization that fails to comply with the requirements of sections 74
81 and 78. The Commissioner would also be authorized to take such action against
82 other health insurers who fail to comply with the requirements of sections 67, 69-
83 73, 77 and 79. (NRS 680A.200)
84 Section 80 of this bill makes various appropriations to the Nevada System of
85 Higher Education and certain institutions within the System for the establishment
86 of: (1) programs for the education and training of behavioral health and wellness
87 practitioners; (2) an accredited internship program for child psychologists; and (3)
88 scholarships for students enrolled in programs for the education and training of
89 providers of health care who may supervise behavioral health and wellness
90 practitioners.

41 upon petition of any party in interest, modify the judgment to award
42 and apportion the unpaid future damages in accordance with this
43 subsection.

45 continuing pattern of failing to make the periodic payments as
-
*SB165*

– 47 –
1 specified pursuant to subsection 5, the court shall find the judgment
2 debtor in contempt of court and, in addition to the required periodic

4 creditor all damages caused by the failure to make such periodic
5 payments, including, but not limited to, court costs and attorney’s
