authorizing the Board of Psychological Examiners to
investigate and impose discipline on a behavioral health and
wellness practitioner; prohibiting the unlicensed practice of

under certain circumstances; requiring Medicaid to cover
behavioral health promotion and prevention services
provided by a behavioral health and wellness practitioner;

providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law provides for the licensure of psychologists by the Board of
Psychological Examiners. (NRS 641.160, 641.170, 641.196) The Board also
registers psychological assistants, psychological interns and psychological trainees.
(NRS 641.226)
Section 10 of this bill defines “behavioral health and wellness practitioner” to
mean a person who is licensed to practice behavioral health promotion and
prevention. Section 11 of this bill defines “behavioral health promotion and
prevention” to mean the supervised clinical use of prevention and intervention
strategies relating to mental and behavioral health. Section 20 of this bill applies
those definitions to the provisions of existing law governing licensure by the Board.
Sections 13-19 and 21-49 of this bill provide for the licensure and regulation of
behavioral health and wellness practitioners by the Board. Section 13: (1) requires
the Board to adopt certain regulations governing behavioral health and wellness
practitioners; and (2) authorizes the Board to accept gifts, grants, donations and
other funds to assist in carrying out the provisions relating to behavioral health and
wellness practitioners. Section 28 authorizes the Board to adopt additional
regulations governing the practice of behavioral health promotion and prevention.
Section 14 requires the Board to establish a Behavioral Health and Wellness
Practitioner Advisory Group to provide the Board with expertise and assistance
relating to the regulation of behavioral health and wellness practitioners. Section 83
eliminates the Advisory Group on December 31, 2028. Section 37.5 of this bill
makes a conforming change to remove a reference to the Advisory Group after it
ceases to exist. Section 15 prescribes the required qualifications to obtain a license
as a behavioral health and wellness practitioner, and section 30 requires an
applicant for such a license to undergo a fingerprint-based background check.
Sections 16 and 17 prescribe procedures relating to the expiration and renewal of
such a license. Section 18 authorizes certain providers of health care, including an
advanced practice registered nurse who has psychiatric training and experience, to
supervise a behavioral health and wellness practitioner. Section 5 of this bill
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 2 –
requires the State Board of Nursing to adopt regulations establishing the psychiatric
training and experience necessary for an advanced practice registered nurse to
provide such supervision. Section 33 establishes the maximum fees for the issuance
or renewal of a license to practice behavioral health promotion and prevention.
Sections 21-23, 25 and 35-47 make the procedures for the investigation and
discipline of psychologists and the grounds for disciplinary action against
psychologists also apply to behavioral health and wellness practitioners. Section
48: (1) prohibits a person from representing himself or herself as a behavioral
health and wellness practitioner unless he or she is licensed as a behavioral health
and wellness practitioner; and (2) authorizes certain persons in a course of study to
practice behavioral health promotion and prevention to engage in the supervised
practice of behavioral health promotion and prevention without a license. Section
49 makes the practice of behavioral health promotion and prevention without a
license or under a false or assumed name a gross misdemeanor. Section 12 of this
bill provides that provisions governing psychologists and persons who provide
behavioral health promotion and prevention services do not apply to certain
government employees. Section 59 of this bill provides that any privilege for
communications between a patient and the supervisor of a behavioral health and
wellness practitioner also applies to communications between the patient and
the behavioral health and wellness practitioner and other persons involved in the
provision of behavioral health promotion and prevention services under the
supervision of the behavioral health and wellness practitioner.
Sections 19, 24, 26, 31 and 32 make conforming changes to include behavioral
health and wellness practitioners within existing provisions where appropriate and
exclude behavioral health and wellness practitioners from existing provisions that
apply only to psychologists. Sections 1-4, 6, 34, 50, 52, 54, 56-58 and 60-62 of this
bill make various revisions to treat behavioral health and wellness practitioners in
the same manner as other similar providers of health care in certain circumstances.
Section 7 of this bill clarifies that a music therapist is not authorized to practice
behavioral health promotion and prevention. Sections 8, 51, 53 and 55 of this bill
provide that a behavioral health and wellness practitioner acting within his or her
scope of practice is not violating provisions governing certain other providers of
health care.
Existing law requires the Department of Health and Human Services to develop
and administer a State Plan for Medicaid which includes a list of specific medical
services required to be provided to Medicaid recipients. (NRS 422.063, 422.270)
Section 66 of this bill requires Medicaid to include coverage for behavioral health
promotion and prevention services provided by a behavioral health and wellness
practitioner. Section 63 of this bill makes a conforming change to require the
Director of the Department to administer the provisions of section 66 in the same
manner as other provisions relating to Medicaid. To carry out the purposes of
section 66, section 79.5 of this bill requires the transfer of money from the Account
to Improve Health Care Quality and Access in the State General Fund to the
Nevada Medicaid budget account and authorizes the expenditure of certain federal
funding. Existing law: (1) creates the Account to Improve Health Care Quality and
Access to hold the revenue collected from assessments and penalties imposed in
certain circumstances against an operator of an agency to provide personal care
services in the home or a medical facility that is required to obtain a license; and (2)
requires the Division of Health Care Financing and Policy of the Department of
Health and Human Services to administer the Account. (NRS 422.3791-422.3795)
Existing law: (1) creates the Fund for a Resilient Nevada to hold the proceeds
of certain litigation by this State concerning the manufacture, distribution, sale or
marketing of opioids; and (2) requires the Director of the Department of Health and
-

Human Services to administer the Fund. (NRS 433.732-433.740) Section 80 of this
bill requires the Director to make allocations, as reimbursement during the 2025-
2027 biennium from the Fund, to the Nevada System of Higher Education and
certain institutions within the System for the costs of the establishment of: (1)
programs for the education and training of behavioral health and wellness
practitioners; (2) an accredited internship program for psychologists with an
emphasis in child psychology; and (3) scholarships for students enrolled in
programs for the education and training of providers of health care who may
supervise behavioral health and wellness practitioners.
