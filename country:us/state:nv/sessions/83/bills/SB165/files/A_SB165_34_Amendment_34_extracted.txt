other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensure of psychologists by the Board of Psychological
2 Examiners. (NRS 641.160, 641.170, 641.196) The Board also registers psychological
3 assistants, psychological interns and psychological trainees. (NRS 641.226)
4 Section 10 of this bill defines “behavioral health and wellness practitioner” to mean a
5 person who is licensed to practice behavioral health promotion and prevention. Section 11 of
6 this bill defines “behavioral health promotion and prevention” to mean the supervised clinical
7 use of prevention and [early] intervention strategies relating to [the] mental and behavioral
8 health . [of a child.] Section 20 of this bill applies those definitions to the provisions of
9 existing law governing licensure by the Board.
10 Sections 13-19 and 21-49 of this bill provide for the licensure and regulation of
11 behavioral health and wellness practitioners by the Board. Section 13: (1) requires the Board
12 to adopt certain regulations governing behavioral health and wellness practitioners; and (2)
13 authorizes the Board to accept gifts, grants, donations and other funds to assist in carrying out
Senate Amendment No. 34 to Senate Bill No. 165 Page 4
14 the provisions relating to behavioral health and wellness practitioners. Section 28 authorizes
15 the Board to adopt additional regulations governing the practice of behavioral health
16 promotion and prevention. Section 14 [authorizes] requires the Board to establish a
17 Behavioral Health and Wellness Practitioner Advisory Group to provide the Board with
18 expertise and assistance relating to the regulation of behavioral health and wellness
19 practitioners. Section 83 eliminates the Advisory Group on December 31, 2028. Section
20 37.5 of this bill makes a conforming change to remove a reference to the Advisory Group
21 after it ceases to exist. Section 15 prescribes the required qualifications to obtain a license as
22 a behavioral health and wellness practitioner, and section 30 requires an applicant for such a
23 license to undergo a fingerprint-based background check. Sections 16 and 17 prescribe
24 procedures relating to the expiration and renewal of such a license. Section 18 authorizes
25 certain providers of health care, including an advanced practice registered nurse who has
26 psychiatric training and experience, to supervise a behavioral health and wellness practitioner.
27 Section 5 of this bill requires the State Board of Nursing to adopt regulations establishing the
28 psychiatric training and experience necessary for an advanced practice registered nurse to
29 provide such supervision. Section 33 establishes the maximum fees for the issuance or
30 renewal of a license to practice behavioral health promotion and prevention.
31 Sections 21-23, 25 and 35-47 make the procedures for the investigation and discipline of
32 psychologists and the grounds for disciplinary action against psychologists also apply to
33 behavioral health and wellness practitioners. Section 48: (1) prohibits a person from
34 representing himself or herself as a behavioral health and wellness practitioner unless he or
35 she is licensed as a behavioral health and wellness practitioner; and (2) authorizes certain
36 persons in a course of study to practice behavioral health promotion and prevention to engage
37 in the supervised practice of behavioral health promotion and prevention without a license.
38 Section 49 makes the practice of behavioral health promotion and prevention without a
39 license or under a false or assumed name a gross misdemeanor. Section 12 of this bill
40 provides that provisions governing psychologists and persons who provide behavioral health
41 promotion and prevention services do not apply to certain government employees. Section 59
42 of this bill [creates a] provides that any privilege for [certain confidential] communications
43 between a patient and [a] the supervisor of a behavioral health and wellness practitioner
44 also applies to communications between the patient and the behavioral health and wellness
45 practitioner [that is similar to existing privileges for such communications with other
46 providers of behavioral health care. (NRS 49.207-49.254, 49.290)] and other persons
47 involved in the provision of behavioral health promotion and prevention services under
48 the supervision of the behavioral health and wellness practitioner.
49 Sections 19, 24, 26, 31 and 32 make conforming changes to include behavioral health
50 and wellness practitioners within existing provisions where appropriate and exclude
51 behavioral health and wellness practitioners from existing provisions that apply only to
52 psychologists. Sections 1-4, 6, 34, 50, 52, 54, 56-58 and 60-62 of this bill make various
53 revisions to treat behavioral health and wellness practitioners in the same manner as other
54 similar providers of health care in certain circumstances. Section 7 of this bill clarifies that a
55 music therapist is not authorized to practice behavioral health promotion and prevention.
56 Sections 8, 51, 53 and 55 of this bill provide that a behavioral health and wellness practitioner
57 acting within his or her scope of practice is not violating provisions governing certain other
58 providers of health care.
59 Existing law requires [public and private policies of health insurance regulated under
60 Nevada law to include certain coverage.] the Department of Health and Human Services to
61 develop and administer a State Plan for Medicaid which includes a list of specific
62 medical services required to be provided to Medicaid recipients. (NRS [287.010,
63 287.04335, 422.27172-422.272428, 689A.04033-689A.0465, 689B.0303-689B.0379,

66 Existing law also requires employers to provide certain benefits for health care to employees,
67 including the coverage required of health insurers, if the employer provides health benefits for
68 its employees. (NRS 608.1555) Sections] 422.063, 422.270) Section 66 [, 74, 75 and 77] of

70 coverage for behavioral health promotion and prevention services provided by a behavioral
71 health and wellness practitioner . [by January 1, 2026. Sections 64, 65, 67, 69-73, 78 and 79 of
72 this bill require other public and private health insurers to provide such coverage and include
Senate Amendment No. 34 to Senate Bill No. 165 Page 5
73 behavioral health and wellness practitioners in their networks by July 1, 2026.] Section 63 of
74 this bill makes a conforming change to require the Director of the Department [of Health and
75 Human Services] to administer the provisions of section 66 in the same manner as other
76 provisions relating to Medicaid. [Section 68 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner of
77 Insurance to require certain policies of health insurance issued by a domestic insurer to a
78 person who resides in another state to include the coverage required by section 67. Section 76
79 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner to suspend or revoke the certificate of a health
80 maintenance organization that fails to comply with the requirements of sections 74 and 78.
81 The Commissioner would also be authorized to take such action against other health insurers
82 who fail to comply with the requirements of sections 67, 69-73, 77 and 79. (NRS 680A.200)]
83 Section 80 of this bill makes various appropriations to the Nevada System of Higher
84 Education and certain institutions within the System for the establishment of: (1) programs for
85 the education and training of behavioral health and wellness practitioners; (2) an accredited
86 internship program for [child] psychologists [;] with an emphasis in child psychology; and

4 pattern of failing to make the periodic payments as specified pursuant to subsection
5 5, the court shall find the judgment debtor in contempt of court and, in addition to
6 the required periodic payments, shall order the judgment debtor to pay the
7 judgment creditor all damages caused by the failure to make such periodic
8 payments, including, but not limited to, court costs and attorney’s fees.

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to behavioral health; providing for the licensure and regulation of
behavioral health and wellness practitioners; [authorizing] requiring
the establishment of a Behavioral Health and Wellness Practitioner
Advisory Group; authorizing the Board of Psychological Examiners to
investigate and impose discipline on a behavioral health and wellness
practitioner; prohibiting the unlicensed practice of behavioral health
promotion and prevention; establishing a privilege for certain
confidential communications between a patient and a behavioral health
and wellness practitioner [;] under certain circumstances; requiring
[certain insurers] Medicaid to cover behavioral health promotion and
prevention services provided by a behavioral health and wellness
practitioner; providing penalties; making appropriations; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensure of psychologists by the Board of Psychological
2 Examiners. (NRS 641.160, 641.170, 641.196) The Board also registers psychological
3 assistants, psychological interns and psychological trainees. (NRS 641.226)
4 Section 10 of this bill defines “behavioral health and wellness practitioner” to mean a
5 person who is licensed to practice behavioral health promotion and prevention. Section 11 of
6 this bill defines “behavioral health promotion and prevention” to mean the supervised clinical
7 use of prevention and [early] intervention strategies relating to [the] mental and behavioral
8 health . [of a child.] Section 20 of this bill applies those definitions to the provisions of
9 existing law governing licensure by the Board.
10 Sections 13-19 and 21-49 of this bill provide for the licensure and regulation of
11 behavioral health and wellness practitioners by the Board. Section 13: (1) requires the Board
12 to adopt certain regulations governing behavioral health and wellness practitioners; and (2)
13 authorizes the Board to accept gifts, grants, donations and other funds to assist in carrying out

Senate Amendment No. 34 to Senate Bill No. 165 Page 4
14 the provisions relating to behavioral health and wellness practitioners. Section 28 authorizes
15 the Board to adopt additional regulations governing the practice of behavioral health
16 promotion and prevention. Section 14 [authorizes] requires the Board to establish a
17 Behavioral Health and Wellness Practitioner Advisory Group to provide the Board with
18 expertise and assistance relating to the regulation of behavioral health and wellness
19 practitioners. Section 83 eliminates the Advisory Group on December 31, 2028. Section
20 37.5 of this bill makes a conforming change to remove a reference to the Advisory Group
21 after it ceases to exist. Section 15 prescribes the required qualifications to obtain a license as
22 a behavioral health and wellness practitioner, and section 30 requires an applicant for such a
23 license to undergo a fingerprint-based background check. Sections 16 and 17 prescribe
24 procedures relating to the expiration and renewal of such a license. Section 18 authorizes
25 certain providers of health care, including an advanced practice registered nurse who has
26 psychiatric training and experience, to supervise a behavioral health and wellness practitioner.

66 Existing law also requires employers to provide certain benefits for health care to employees,
67 including the coverage required of health insurers, if the employer provides health benefits for
68 its employees. (NRS 608.1555) Sections] 422.063, 422.270) Section 66 [, 74, 75 and 77] of
69 this bill [require] requires Medicaid [and the Children’s Health Insurance Program] to include
70 coverage for behavioral health promotion and prevention services provided by a behavioral
71 health and wellness practitioner . [by January 1, 2026. Sections 64, 65, 67, 69-73, 78 and 79 of
72 this bill require other public and private health insurers to provide such coverage and include

Senate Amendment No. 34 to Senate Bill No. 165 Page 5
73 behavioral health and wellness practitioners in their networks by July 1, 2026.] Section 63 of
74 this bill makes a conforming change to require the Director of the Department [of Health and
75 Human Services] to administer the provisions of section 66 in the same manner as other
76 provisions relating to Medicaid. [Section 68 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner of
77 Insurance to require certain policies of health insurance issued by a domestic insurer to a
78 person who resides in another state to include the coverage required by section 67. Section 76
79 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner to suspend or revoke the certificate of a health
80 maintenance organization that fails to comply with the requirements of sections 74 and 78.
81 The Commissioner would also be authorized to take such action against other health insurers
82 who fail to comply with the requirements of sections 67, 69-73, 77 and 79. (NRS 680A.200)]
83 Section 80 of this bill makes various appropriations to the Nevada System of Higher
84 Education and certain institutions within the System for the establishment of: (1) programs for
85 the education and training of behavioral health and wellness practitioners; (2) an accredited

29 3. In an action for injury or death against a provider of health care based upon
30 professional negligence, a district court shall, at the request of either party, enter a
31 judgment ordering that money damages or its equivalent for future damages of the
32 judgment creditor be paid in whole or in part by periodic payments rather than by a
33 lump-sum payment if the award equals or exceeds $50,000 in future damages.
34 4. In entering a judgment ordering the payment of future damages by periodic
35 payments pursuant to subsection 3, the court shall make a specific finding as to the
36 dollar amount of periodic payments that will compensate the judgment creditor for
37 such future damages. As a condition to authorizing periodic payments of future
38 damages, the court shall require a judgment debtor who is not adequately insured to
39 post security adequate to assure full payment of such damages awarded by the
40 judgment. Upon termination of periodic payments of future damages, the court
41 shall order the return of this security, or so much as remains, to the judgment
42 debtor.
43 5. A judgment ordering the payment of future damages by periodic payments
44 entered pursuant to subsection 3 must specify the recipient or recipients of the
45 payments, the dollar amount of the payments, the interval between payments, and
46 the number of payments or the period of time over which payments will be made.
47 Such payments must only be subject to modification in the event of the death of the
48 judgment creditor. Money damages awarded for loss of future earnings must not be
49 reduced or payments terminated by reason of the death of the judgment creditor, but
50 must be paid to persons to whom the judgment creditor owed a duty of support, as
51 provided by law, immediately before the judgment creditor’s death. In such cases,
52 the court that rendered the original judgment may, upon petition of any party in

Senate Amendment No. 34 to Senate Bill No. 165 Page 37
1 interest, modify the judgment to award and apportion the unpaid future damages in
2 accordance with this subsection.
3 6. If the court finds that the judgment debtor has exhibited a continuing
4 pattern of failing to make the periodic payments as specified pursuant to subsection
5 5, the court shall find the judgment debtor in contempt of court and, in addition to
6 the required periodic payments, shall order the judgment debtor to pay the
7 judgment creditor all damages caused by the failure to make such periodic
8 payments, including, but not limited to, court costs and attorney’s fees.
9 7. Following the occurrence or expiration of all obligations specified in the
10 periodic payment judgment, any obligation of the judgment debtor to make further
11 payments ceases and any security given pursuant to subsection 4 reverts to the
12 judgment debtor.
