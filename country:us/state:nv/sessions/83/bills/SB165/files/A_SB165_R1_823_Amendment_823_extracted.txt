AN ACT relating to behavioral health; providing for the licensure and regulation of
behavioral health and wellness practitioners; requiring the
establishment of a Behavioral Health and Wellness Practitioner
Advisory Group; authorizing the Board of Psychological Examiners to
investigate and impose discipline on a behavioral health and wellness
practitioner; prohibiting the unlicensed practice of behavioral health
promotion and prevention; establishing a privilege for certain
confidential communications between a patient and a behavioral health
and wellness practitioner under certain circumstances; requiring
Medicaid to cover behavioral health promotion and prevention services
provided by a behavioral health and wellness practitioner; providing
penalties; [making appropriations;] requiring certain allocations and
transfers of money and authorizing certain expenditures; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensure of psychologists by the Board of Psychological
2 Examiners. (NRS 641.160, 641.170, 641.196) The Board also registers psychological
3 assistants, psychological interns and psychological trainees. (NRS 641.226)
4 Section 10 of this bill defines “behavioral health and wellness practitioner” to mean a
5 person who is licensed to practice behavioral health promotion and prevention. Section 11 of
6 this bill defines “behavioral health promotion and prevention” to mean the supervised clinical
7 use of prevention and intervention strategies relating to mental and behavioral health. Section
8 20 of this bill applies those definitions to the provisions of existing law governing licensure by
9 the Board.
10 Sections 13-19 and 21-49 of this bill provide for the licensure and regulation of
11 behavioral health and wellness practitioners by the Board. Section 13: (1) requires the Board
12 to adopt certain regulations governing behavioral health and wellness practitioners; and (2)
13 authorizes the Board to accept gifts, grants, donations and other funds to assist in carrying out
14 the provisions relating to behavioral health and wellness practitioners. Section 28 authorizes
15 the Board to adopt additional regulations governing the practice of behavioral health
Senate Amendment No. 823 to Senate Bill No. 165 First Reprint Page 4
16 promotion and prevention. Section 14 requires the Board to establish a Behavioral Health and
17 Wellness Practitioner Advisory Group to provide the Board with expertise and assistance
18 relating to the regulation of behavioral health and wellness practitioners. Section 83
19 eliminates the Advisory Group on December 31, 2028. Section 37.5 of this bill makes a
20 conforming change to remove a reference to the Advisory Group after it ceases to exist.
21 Section 15 prescribes the required qualifications to obtain a license as a behavioral health and
22 wellness practitioner, and section 30 requires an applicant for such a license to undergo a
23 fingerprint-based background check. Sections 16 and 17 prescribe procedures relating to the
24 expiration and renewal of such a license. Section 18 authorizes certain providers of health
25 care, including an advanced practice registered nurse who has psychiatric training and
26 experience, to supervise a behavioral health and wellness practitioner. Section 5 of this bill
27 requires the State Board of Nursing to adopt regulations establishing the psychiatric training
28 and experience necessary for an advanced practice registered nurse to provide such
29 supervision. Section 33 establishes the maximum fees for the issuance or renewal of a license
30 to practice behavioral health promotion and prevention.
31 Sections 21-23, 25 and 35-47 make the procedures for the investigation and discipline of
32 psychologists and the grounds for disciplinary action against psychologists also apply to
33 behavioral health and wellness practitioners. Section 48: (1) prohibits a person from
34 representing himself or herself as a behavioral health and wellness practitioner unless he or
35 she is licensed as a behavioral health and wellness practitioner; and (2) authorizes certain
36 persons in a course of study to practice behavioral health promotion and prevention to engage
37 in the supervised practice of behavioral health promotion and prevention without a license.
38 Section 49 makes the practice of behavioral health promotion and prevention without a
39 license or under a false or assumed name a gross misdemeanor. Section 12 of this bill
40 provides that provisions governing psychologists and persons who provide behavioral health
41 promotion and prevention services do not apply to certain government employees. Section 59
42 of this bill provides that any privilege for communications between a patient and the
43 supervisor of a behavioral health and wellness practitioner also applies to communications
44 between the patient and the behavioral health and wellness practitioner and other persons
45 involved in the provision of behavioral health promotion and prevention services under the
46 supervision of the behavioral health and wellness practitioner.
47 Sections 19, 24, 26, 31 and 32 make conforming changes to include behavioral health
48 and wellness practitioners within existing provisions where appropriate and exclude
49 behavioral health and wellness practitioners from existing provisions that apply only to
50 psychologists. Sections 1-4, 6, 34, 50, 52, 54, 56-58 and 60-62 of this bill make various
51 revisions to treat behavioral health and wellness practitioners in the same manner as other
52 similar providers of health care in certain circumstances. Section 7 of this bill clarifies that a
53 music therapist is not authorized to practice behavioral health promotion and prevention.
54 Sections 8, 51, 53 and 55 of this bill provide that a behavioral health and wellness practitioner
55 acting within his or her scope of practice is not violating provisions governing certain other
56 providers of health care.
57 Existing law requires the Department of Health and Human Services to develop and
58 administer a State Plan for Medicaid which includes a list of specific medical services
59 required to be provided to Medicaid recipients. (NRS 422.063, 422.270) Section 66 of this bill
60 requires Medicaid to include coverage for behavioral health promotion and prevention
61 services provided by a behavioral health and wellness practitioner. Section 63 of this bill
62 makes a conforming change to require the Director of the Department to administer the
63 provisions of section 66 in the same manner as other provisions relating to Medicaid. To
64 carry out the purposes of section 66, section 79.5 of this bill requires the transfer of
65 money from the Account to Improve Health Care Quality and Access in the State
66 General Fund to the Nevada Medicaid budget account and authorizes the expenditure of
67 certain federal funding. Existing law: (1) creates the Account to Improve Health Care
68 Quality and Access to hold the revenue collected from assessments and penalties
69 imposed in certain circumstances against an operator of an agency to provide personal
70 care services in the home or a medical facility that is required to obtain a license; and (2)
71 requires the Division of Health Care Financing and Policy of the Department of Health
72 and Human Services to administer the Account. (NRS 422.3791-422.3795)
73 Existing law: (1) creates the Fund for a Resilient Nevada to hold the proceeds of
74 certain litigation by this State concerning the manufacture, distribution, sale or
Senate Amendment No. 823 to Senate Bill No. 165 First Reprint Page 5
75 marketing of opioids; and (2) requires the Director of the Department of Health and
76 Human Services to administer the Fund. (NRS 433.732-433.740) Section 80 of this bill
77 [makes various appropriations] requires the Director to make allocations, as
78 reimbursement during the 2025-2027 biennium from the Fund, to the Nevada System of
79 Higher Education and certain institutions within the System for the costs of the establishment
80 of: (1) programs for the education and training of behavioral health and wellness practitioners;
81 (2) an accredited internship program for psychologists with an emphasis in child psychology;
82 and (3) scholarships for students enrolled in programs for the education and training of
83 providers of health care who may supervise behavioral health and wellness practitioners.

4 42.021 1. In an action for injury or death against a provider of health care
5 based upon professional negligence, if the defendant so elects, the defendant may
6 introduce evidence of any amount payable as a benefit to the plaintiff as a result of

16 2. A source of collateral benefits introduced pursuant to subsection 1 may not:

20 professional negligence, a district court shall, at the request of either party, enter a

24 4. In entering a judgment ordering the payment of future damages by periodic
25 payments pursuant to subsection 3, the court shall make a specific finding as to the
26 dollar amount of periodic payments that will compensate the judgment creditor for
27 such future damages. As a condition to authorizing periodic payments of future
28 damages, the court shall require a judgment debtor who is not adequately insured to
29 post security adequate to assure full payment of such damages awarded by the
30 judgment. Upon termination of periodic payments of future damages, the court
31 shall order the return of this security, or so much as remains, to the judgment
32 debtor.
33 5. A judgment ordering the payment of future damages by periodic payments
34 entered pursuant to subsection 3 must specify the recipient or recipients of the

36 the number of payments or the period of time over which payments will be made.
37 Such payments must only be subject to modification in the event of the death of the
38 judgment creditor. Money damages awarded for loss of future earnings must not be
39 reduced or payments terminated by reason of the death of the judgment creditor, but
40 must be paid to persons to whom the judgment creditor owed a duty of support, as
41 provided by law, immediately before the judgment creditor’s death. In such cases,
42 the court that rendered the original judgment may, upon petition of any party in
43 interest, modify the judgment to award and apportion the unpaid future damages in
44 accordance with this subsection.
45 6. If the court finds that the judgment debtor has exhibited a continuing
46 pattern of failing to make the periodic payments as specified pursuant to subsection
47 5, the court shall find the judgment debtor in contempt of court and, in addition to
48 the required periodic payments, shall order the judgment debtor to pay the
49 judgment creditor all damages caused by the failure to make such periodic
50 payments, including, but not limited to, court costs and attorney’s fees.
51 7. Following the occurrence or expiration of all obligations specified in the
52 periodic payment judgment, any obligation of the judgment debtor to make further

1 payments ceases and any security given pursuant to subsection 4 reverts to the
2 judgment debtor.

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to behavioral health; providing for the licensure and regulation of
behavioral health and wellness practitioners; requiring the
establishment of a Behavioral Health and Wellness Practitioner
Advisory Group; authorizing the Board of Psychological Examiners to
investigate and impose discipline on a behavioral health and wellness
practitioner; prohibiting the unlicensed practice of behavioral health
promotion and prevention; establishing a privilege for certain
confidential communications between a patient and a behavioral health
and wellness practitioner under certain circumstances; requiring
Medicaid to cover behavioral health promotion and prevention services
provided by a behavioral health and wellness practitioner; providing
penalties; [making appropriations;] requiring certain allocations and
transfers of money and authorizing certain expenditures; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensure of psychologists by the Board of Psychological
2 Examiners. (NRS 641.160, 641.170, 641.196) The Board also registers psychological
3 assistants, psychological interns and psychological trainees. (NRS 641.226)
4 Section 10 of this bill defines “behavioral health and wellness practitioner” to mean a
5 person who is licensed to practice behavioral health promotion and prevention. Section 11 of
6 this bill defines “behavioral health promotion and prevention” to mean the supervised clinical
7 use of prevention and intervention strategies relating to mental and behavioral health. Section
8 20 of this bill applies those definitions to the provisions of existing law governing licensure by
9 the Board.
10 Sections 13-19 and 21-49 of this bill provide for the licensure and regulation of
11 behavioral health and wellness practitioners by the Board. Section 13: (1) requires the Board
12 to adopt certain regulations governing behavioral health and wellness practitioners; and (2)
13 authorizes the Board to accept gifts, grants, donations and other funds to assist in carrying out
14 the provisions relating to behavioral health and wellness practitioners. Section 28 authorizes
15 the Board to adopt additional regulations governing the practice of behavioral health

Senate Amendment No. 823 to Senate Bill No. 165 First Reprint Page 4
16 promotion and prevention. Section 14 requires the Board to establish a Behavioral Health and
17 Wellness Practitioner Advisory Group to provide the Board with expertise and assistance
18 relating to the regulation of behavioral health and wellness practitioners. Section 83
19 eliminates the Advisory Group on December 31, 2028. Section 37.5 of this bill makes a
20 conforming change to remove a reference to the Advisory Group after it ceases to exist.
21 Section 15 prescribes the required qualifications to obtain a license as a behavioral health and
22 wellness practitioner, and section 30 requires an applicant for such a license to undergo a
23 fingerprint-based background check. Sections 16 and 17 prescribe procedures relating to the
24 expiration and renewal of such a license. Section 18 authorizes certain providers of health
25 care, including an advanced practice registered nurse who has psychiatric training and
26 experience, to supervise a behavioral health and wellness practitioner. Section 5 of this bill
27 requires the State Board of Nursing to adopt regulations establishing the psychiatric training
28 and experience necessary for an advanced practice registered nurse to provide such
29 supervision. Section 33 establishes the maximum fees for the issuance or renewal of a license
30 to practice behavioral health promotion and prevention.
31 Sections 21-23, 25 and 35-47 make the procedures for the investigation and discipline of
32 psychologists and the grounds for disciplinary action against psychologists also apply to
33 behavioral health and wellness practitioners. Section 48: (1) prohibits a person from
34 representing himself or herself as a behavioral health and wellness practitioner unless he or
35 she is licensed as a behavioral health and wellness practitioner; and (2) authorizes certain
36 persons in a course of study to practice behavioral health promotion and prevention to engage
37 in the supervised practice of behavioral health promotion and prevention without a license.
38 Section 49 makes the practice of behavioral health promotion and prevention without a
39 license or under a false or assumed name a gross misdemeanor. Section 12 of this bill
40 provides that provisions governing psychologists and persons who provide behavioral health
41 promotion and prevention services do not apply to certain government employees. Section 59
42 of this bill provides that any privilege for communications between a patient and the
43 supervisor of a behavioral health and wellness practitioner also applies to communications
44 between the patient and the behavioral health and wellness practitioner and other persons
45 involved in the provision of behavioral health promotion and prevention services under the
46 supervision of the behavioral health and wellness practitioner.
47 Sections 19, 24, 26, 31 and 32 make conforming changes to include behavioral health
48 and wellness practitioners within existing provisions where appropriate and exclude
49 behavioral health and wellness practitioners from existing provisions that apply only to
50 psychologists. Sections 1-4, 6, 34, 50, 52, 54, 56-58 and 60-62 of this bill make various
51 revisions to treat behavioral health and wellness practitioners in the same manner as other
52 similar providers of health care in certain circumstances. Section 7 of this bill clarifies that a
53 music therapist is not authorized to practice behavioral health promotion and prevention.
54 Sections 8, 51, 53 and 55 of this bill provide that a behavioral health and wellness practitioner
55 acting within his or her scope of practice is not violating provisions governing certain other
56 providers of health care.
57 Existing law requires the Department of Health and Human Services to develop and
58 administer a State Plan for Medicaid which includes a list of specific medical services
59 required to be provided to Medicaid recipients. (NRS 422.063, 422.270) Section 66 of this bill
60 requires Medicaid to include coverage for behavioral health promotion and prevention
61 services provided by a behavioral health and wellness practitioner. Section 63 of this bill
62 makes a conforming change to require the Director of the Department to administer the
63 provisions of section 66 in the same manner as other provisions relating to Medicaid. To
64 carry out the purposes of section 66, section 79.5 of this bill requires the transfer of
65 money from the Account to Improve Health Care Quality and Access in the State
66 General Fund to the Nevada Medicaid budget account and authorizes the expenditure of
67 certain federal funding. Existing law: (1) creates the Account to Improve Health Care
68 Quality and Access to hold the revenue collected from assessments and penalties
69 imposed in certain circumstances against an operator of an agency to provide personal
70 care services in the home or a medical facility that is required to obtain a license; and (2)
71 requires the Division of Health Care Financing and Policy of the Department of Health
72 and Human Services to administer the Account. (NRS 422.3791-422.3795)
73 Existing law: (1) creates the Fund for a Resilient Nevada to hold the proceeds of
74 certain litigation by this State concerning the manufacture, distribution, sale or

Senate Amendment No. 823 to Senate Bill No. 165 First Reprint Page 5
75 marketing of opioids; and (2) requires the Director of the Department of Health and
76 Human Services to administer the Fund. (NRS 433.732-433.740) Section 80 of this bill
77 [makes various appropriations] requires the Director to make allocations, as
78 reimbursement during the 2025-2027 biennium from the Fund, to the Nevada System of
79 Higher Education and certain institutions within the System for the costs of the establishment
80 of: (1) programs for the education and training of behavioral health and wellness practitioners;
81 (2) an accredited internship program for psychologists with an emphasis in child psychology;
82 and (3) scholarships for students enrolled in programs for the education and training of
83 providers of health care who may supervise behavioral health and wellness practitioners.

49 judgment creditor all damages caused by the failure to make such periodic
50 payments, including, but not limited to, court costs and attorney’s fees.
