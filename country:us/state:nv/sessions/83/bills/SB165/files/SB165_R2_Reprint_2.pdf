5 Section 10 of this bill defines “behavioral health and wellness practitioner” to
6 mean a person who is licensed to practice behavioral health promotion and
7 prevention. Section 11 of this bill defines “behavioral health promotion and
8 prevention” to mean the supervised clinical use of prevention and intervention
9 strategies relating to mental and behavioral health. Section 20 of this bill applies
10 those definitions to the provisions of existing law governing licensure by the Board.
11 Sections 13-19 and 21-49 of this bill provide for the licensure and regulation of
12 behavioral health and wellness practitioners by the Board. Section 13: (1) requires
13 the Board to adopt certain regulations governing behavioral health and wellness
14 practitioners; and (2) authorizes the Board to accept gifts, grants, donations and
15 other funds to assist in carrying out the provisions relating to behavioral health and
16 wellness practitioners. Section 28 authorizes the Board to adopt additional
17 regulations governing the practice of behavioral health promotion and prevention.
18 Section 14 requires the Board to establish a Behavioral Health and Wellness
19 Practitioner Advisory Group to provide the Board with expertise and assistance
20 relating to the regulation of behavioral health and wellness practitioners. Section 83
21 eliminates the Advisory Group on December 31, 2028. Section 37.5 of this bill
22 makes a conforming change to remove a reference to the Advisory Group after it
23 ceases to exist. Section 15 prescribes the required qualifications to obtain a license
24 as a behavioral health and wellness practitioner, and section 30 requires an
25 applicant for such a license to undergo a fingerprint-based background check.
26 Sections 16 and 17 prescribe procedures relating to the expiration and renewal of
27 such a license. Section 18 authorizes certain providers of health care, including an
28 advanced practice registered nurse who has psychiatric training and experience, to
29 supervise a behavioral health and wellness practitioner. Section 5 of this bill
30 requires the State Board of Nursing to adopt regulations establishing the psychiatric
31 training and experience necessary for an advanced practice registered nurse to
32 provide such supervision. Section 33 establishes the maximum fees for the issuance
33 or renewal of a license to practice behavioral health promotion and prevention.
34 Sections 21-23, 25 and 35-47 make the procedures for the investigation and
35 discipline of psychologists and the grounds for disciplinary action against
36 psychologists also apply to behavioral health and wellness practitioners. Section
37 48: (1) prohibits a person from representing himself or herself as a behavioral
38 health and wellness practitioner unless he or she is licensed as a behavioral health
39 and wellness practitioner; and (2) authorizes certain persons in a course of study to
40 practice behavioral health promotion and prevention to engage in the supervised
41 practice of behavioral health promotion and prevention without a license. Section
42 49 makes the practice of behavioral health promotion and prevention without a
43 license or under a false or assumed name a gross misdemeanor. Section 12 of this
44 bill provides that provisions governing psychologists and persons who provide
45 behavioral health promotion and prevention services do not apply to certain
46 government employees. Section 59 of this bill provides that any privilege for
47 communications between a patient and the supervisor of a behavioral health and
48 wellness practitioner also applies to communications between the patient and
49 the behavioral health and wellness practitioner and other persons involved in the
50 provision of behavioral health promotion and prevention services under the
51 supervision of the behavioral health and wellness practitioner.
52 Sections 19, 24, 26, 31 and 32 make conforming changes to include behavioral
53 health and wellness practitioners within existing provisions where appropriate and
54 exclude behavioral health and wellness practitioners from existing provisions that
55 apply only to psychologists. Sections 1-4, 6, 34, 50, 52, 54, 56-58 and 60-62 of this
56 bill make various revisions to treat behavioral health and wellness practitioners in
57 the same manner as other similar providers of health care in certain circumstances.
58 Section 7 of this bill clarifies that a music therapist is not authorized to practice
59 behavioral health promotion and prevention. Sections 8, 51, 53 and 55 of this bill
-
*SB165_R2*

– 3 –
60 provide that a behavioral health and wellness practitioner acting within his or her
61 scope of practice is not violating provisions governing certain other providers of
62 health care.
63 Existing law requires the Department of Health and Human Services to develop
64 and administer a State Plan for Medicaid which includes a list of specific medical
65 services required to be provided to Medicaid recipients. (NRS 422.063, 422.270)
66 Section 66 of this bill requires Medicaid to include coverage for behavioral health
67 promotion and prevention services provided by a behavioral health and wellness
68 practitioner. Section 63 of this bill makes a conforming change to require the
69 Director of the Department to administer the provisions of section 66 in the same
70 manner as other provisions relating to Medicaid. To carry out the purposes of
71 section 66, section 79.5 of this bill requires the transfer of money from the Account
72 to Improve Health Care Quality and Access in the State General Fund to the
73 Nevada Medicaid budget account and authorizes the expenditure of certain federal
74 funding. Existing law: (1) creates the Account to Improve Health Care Quality and
75 Access to hold the revenue collected from assessments and penalties imposed in
76 certain circumstances against an operator of an agency to provide personal care
77 services in the home or a medical facility that is required to obtain a license; and (2)
78 requires the Division of Health Care Financing and Policy of the Department of
79 Health and Human Services to administer the Account. (NRS 422.3791-422.3795)
80 Existing law: (1) creates the Fund for a Resilient Nevada to hold the proceeds
81 of certain litigation by this State concerning the manufacture, distribution, sale or
82 marketing of opioids; and (2) requires the Director of the Department of Health and
83 Human Services to administer the Fund. (NRS 433.732-433.740) Section 80 of this
84 bill requires the Director to make allocations, as reimbursement during the 2025-
85 2027 biennium from the Fund, to the Nevada System of Higher Education and
86 certain institutions within the System for the costs of the establishment of: (1)
87 programs for the education and training of behavioral health and wellness
88 practitioners; (2) an accredited internship program for psychologists with an
89 emphasis in child psychology; and (3) scholarships for students enrolled in
90 programs for the education and training of providers of health care who may
91 supervise behavioral health and wellness practitioners.

39 continuing pattern of failing to make the periodic payments as
40 specified pursuant to subsection 5, the court shall find the judgment
41 debtor in contempt of court and, in addition to the required periodic
