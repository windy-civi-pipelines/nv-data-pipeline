SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to elections.
(BDR 24-569)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.

CONTAINS UNFUNDED MANDATE (§§ 1, 2, 4.5)

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to elections; requiring a county clerk in certain
counties to establish a certain number of locations for a
voter to return his or her mail ballot in a mail ballot drop
box during the period between the last day for early
voting and the day of a general election; authorizing the
county clerk in certain counties to establish such
locations; authorizing a person, under certain
circumstances, to return a mail ballot to a mail ballot drop
box established at such a location on behalf of a voter;
requiring mail ballot drop boxes to be monitored and
secured; requiring the Secretary of State to establish
requirements for monitoring and securing mail ballot drop
boxes; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law: (1) requires a general election to be held on the first Tuesday after
2 the first Monday of November in each even-numbered year; and (2) provides that
3 the period for early voting by personal appearance begins the third Saturday
4 preceding a general election and extends through the Friday before election day.
5 (NRS 293.12755, 293.3568) Existing law further requires each county clerk to
-
*AB306_R1*
– 2 –
6 establish: (1) a certain number of polling places where a person can vote during the
7 period for early voting by personal appearance and on the day of the general
8 election; and (2) a ballot drop box at every polling place in the county, including,
9 without limitation, a polling place for early voting. (NRS 293.269921, 293.2731,
10 293.3564)
11 Section 1 of this bill requires each county clerk in certain counties to, for the
12 period beginning on the day after the last day for early voting by personal
13 appearance and ending on the day before the day of the general election, establish a
14 certain number of locations where a voter may return his or her mail ballot in a mail
15 ballot drop box and requires such locations to be open for at least 7 hours each day
16 during that period for certain counties. Specifically, in a county whose population is
17 700,000 or more (currently only Clark County), a county clerk is required to
18 establish 10 such locations, and in a county whose population is 100,000 or more
19 but less than 700,000 (currently only Washoe County), a county clerk is required to
20 establish 5 such locations. Section 1 further authorizes a county clerk in a county
21 whose population is less than 100,000 (currently all counties other than Clark and
22 Washoe Counties) to establish any number of such locations and prescribe the
23 hours for such locations to be open. Section 2 of this bill provides that a mail ballot
24 dropped in a mail ballot drop box pursuant to section 1 counts as a vote in the
25 general election. Section 4 of this bill makes a conforming change to make certain
26 provisions relating to mail ballots generally applicable to section 1.
27 Existing law requires a ballot drop box to meet certain requirements, including
28 a requirement for the ballot drop box to be made available for use during the hours
29 when the office of the county or city clerk or the polling place is open for business
30 or voting, as applicable. (NRS 293.269921, 293C.26321) Sections 2 and 4.5 of this
31 bill require a ballot drop box to be: (1) monitored at all times during such a period;
32 and (2) secured during any period of time in which the ballot drop box is not
33 available for use. Sections 2 and 4.5 additionally require the Secretary of State to
34 adopt regulations to establish requirements for monitoring and securing ballot drop
35 boxes.
36 Existing law authorizes, at the request of a voter whose mail ballot has been
37 prepared by or on behalf of the voter, a person authorized by the voter to return the
38 mail ballot on behalf of the voter by mail or personal delivery to the county clerk,
39 or any ballot drop box established in the county by the county clerk. (NRS
40 293.269923) Section 3 of this bill additionally authorizes a person, under such
41 circumstances, to return a mail ballot on behalf of a voter by returning the mail
42 ballot to a mail ballot drop box established pursuant to section 1.
