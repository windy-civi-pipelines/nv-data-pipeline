EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to elections; requiring a county clerk in certain counties to
establish a certain number of locations for a voter to return his or her
mail ballot in a mail ballot drop box during the period between the last
day for early voting and the day of a general election; authorizing the
county clerk in certain counties to establish such locations; authorizing
a person, under certain circumstances, to return a mail ballot to a mail
ballot drop box established at such a location on behalf of a voter;
requiring mail ballot drop boxes to be monitored and secured;
requiring the Secretary of State to establish requirements for
monitoring and securing mail ballot drop boxes; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law: (1) requires a general election to be held on the first Tuesday after the first
2 Monday of November in each even-numbered year; and (2) provides that the period for early
3 voting by personal appearance begins the third Saturday preceding a general election and
4 extends through the Friday before election day. (NRS 293.12755, 293.3568) Existing law
5 further requires each county clerk to [:] establish: (1) [establish] a certain number of polling
6 places where a person can vote during the period for early voting by personal appearance and
7 on the day of the general election; and (2) [requires each county clerk to establish] a ballot
8 drop box at every polling place in the county, including, without limitation, a polling place for
9 early voting. (NRS 293.269921, 293.2731, 293.3564)
10 Section 1 of this bill requires each county clerk in certain counties to, for the period
11 beginning on the day after the last day for early voting by personal appearance and ending on
12 the day before the day of the general election, establish a certain number of locations where a
13 voter may return his or her mail ballot in a mail ballot drop box and requires such locations to
14 be open for at least 7 hours each day during that period for certain counties. Specifically, in a
Assembly Amendment No. 94 to Assembly Bill No. 306 Page 4
15 county whose population is 700,000 or more (currently only Clark County), a county clerk is
16 required to establish 10 such locations, and in a county whose population is 100,000 or more
17 but less than 700,000 (currently only Washoe County), a county clerk is required to establish
18 5 such locations. Section 1 further authorizes a county clerk in a county whose population is
19 less than 100,000 (currently all counties other than Clark and Washoe Counties) to establish
20 any number of such locations and prescribe the hours for such locations to be open. Section 2
21 of this bill provides that a mail ballot dropped in a mail ballot drop box pursuant to section 1
22 counts as a vote in the general election. Section 4 of this bill makes a conforming change to
23 make certain provisions relating to mail ballots generally applicable to section 1.
24 Existing law requires a ballot drop box to meet certain requirements, including a
25 requirement for the ballot drop box to be made available for use during the hours when
26 the office of the county or city clerk or the polling place is open for business or voting, as
27 applicable. (NRS 293.269921, 293C.26321) Sections 2 and 4.5 of this bill require a ballot
28 drop box to be: (1) monitored at all times during such a period; and (2) secured during
29 any period of time in which the ballot drop box is not available for use. Sections 2 and
30 4.5 additionally require the Secretary of State to adopt regulations to establish
31 requirements for monitoring and securing ballot drop boxes.
32 Existing law authorizes, at the request of a voter whose mail ballot has been prepared by
33 or on behalf of the voter, a person authorized by the voter to return the mail ballot on behalf of
34 the voter by mail or personal delivery to the county clerk, or any ballot drop box established in
35 the county by the county clerk. (NRS 293.269923) Section 3 of this bill additionally
36 authorizes a person, under such circumstances, to return a mail ballot on behalf of a voter by
37 returning the mail ballot to a mail ballot drop box established pursuant to section 1.

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to elections; requiring a county clerk in certain counties to
establish a certain number of locations for a voter to return his or her
mail ballot in a mail ballot drop box during the period between the last
day for early voting and the day of a general election; authorizing the
county clerk in certain counties to establish such locations; authorizing
a person, under certain circumstances, to return a mail ballot to a mail
ballot drop box established at such a location on behalf of a voter;
requiring mail ballot drop boxes to be monitored and secured;
requiring the Secretary of State to establish requirements for
monitoring and securing mail ballot drop boxes; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law: (1) requires a general election to be held on the first Tuesday after the first
2 Monday of November in each even-numbered year; and (2) provides that the period for early
3 voting by personal appearance begins the third Saturday preceding a general election and
4 extends through the Friday before election day. (NRS 293.12755, 293.3568) Existing law
5 further requires each county clerk to [:] establish: (1) [establish] a certain number of polling
6 places where a person can vote during the period for early voting by personal appearance and
7 on the day of the general election; and (2) [requires each county clerk to establish] a ballot
8 drop box at every polling place in the county, including, without limitation, a polling place for
9 early voting. (NRS 293.269921, 293.2731, 293.3564)
10 Section 1 of this bill requires each county clerk in certain counties to, for the period
11 beginning on the day after the last day for early voting by personal appearance and ending on
12 the day before the day of the general election, establish a certain number of locations where a
13 voter may return his or her mail ballot in a mail ballot drop box and requires such locations to
14 be open for at least 7 hours each day during that period for certain counties. Specifically, in a

Assembly Amendment No. 94 to Assembly Bill No. 306 Page 4
15 county whose population is 700,000 or more (currently only Clark County), a county clerk is
16 required to establish 10 such locations, and in a county whose population is 100,000 or more
17 but less than 700,000 (currently only Washoe County), a county clerk is required to establish
18 5 such locations. Section 1 further authorizes a county clerk in a county whose population is
19 less than 100,000 (currently all counties other than Clark and Washoe Counties) to establish
20 any number of such locations and prescribe the hours for such locations to be open. Section 2
21 of this bill provides that a mail ballot dropped in a mail ballot drop box pursuant to section 1
22 counts as a vote in the general election. Section 4 of this bill makes a conforming change to
23 make certain provisions relating to mail ballots generally applicable to section 1.
24 Existing law requires a ballot drop box to meet certain requirements, including a
25 requirement for the ballot drop box to be made available for use during the hours when
26 the office of the county or city clerk or the polling place is open for business or voting, as
27 applicable. (NRS 293.269921, 293C.26321) Sections 2 and 4.5 of this bill require a ballot
28 drop box to be: (1) monitored at all times during such a period; and (2) secured during
29 any period of time in which the ballot drop box is not available for use. Sections 2 and
30 4.5 additionally require the Secretary of State to adopt regulations to establish
31 requirements for monitoring and securing ballot drop boxes.
32 Existing law authorizes, at the request of a voter whose mail ballot has been prepared by
33 or on behalf of the voter, a person authorized by the voter to return the mail ballot on behalf of
34 the voter by mail or personal delivery to the county clerk, or any ballot drop box established in
35 the county by the county clerk. (NRS 293.269923) Section 3 of this bill additionally
36 authorizes a person, under such circumstances, to return a mail ballot on behalf of a voter by
37 returning the mail ballot to a mail ballot drop box established pursuant to section 1.
