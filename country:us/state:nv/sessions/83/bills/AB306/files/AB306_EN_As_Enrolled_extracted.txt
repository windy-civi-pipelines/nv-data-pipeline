CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to elections; requiring a county clerk in certain
counties to establish a certain number of locations for a voter
to return his or her mail ballot in a mail ballot drop box
during the period between the last day for early voting and
the day of a general election; authorizing the county clerk in
certain counties to establish such locations; authorizing a
person, under certain circumstances, to return a mail ballot to
a mail ballot drop box established at such a location on behalf
of a voter; requiring mail ballot drop boxes to be monitored
and secured; requiring the Secretary of State to establish
requirements for monitoring and securing mail ballot drop
boxes; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law: (1) requires a general election to be held on the first Tuesday after
the first Monday of November in each even-numbered year; and (2) provides that
the period for early voting by personal appearance begins the third Saturday
preceding a general election and extends through the Friday before election day.
(NRS 293.12755, 293.3568) Existing law further requires each county clerk to
establish: (1) a certain number of polling places where a person can vote during the
period for early voting by personal appearance and on the day of the general
election; and (2) a ballot drop box at every polling place in the county, including,
without limitation, a polling place for early voting. (NRS 293.269921, 293.2731,

Section 2:

Section 3:
Section 1 of this bill requires each county clerk in certain counties to, for the
period beginning on the day after the last day for early voting by personal
appearance and ending on the day before the day of the general election, establish a
certain number of locations where a voter may return his or her mail ballot in a mail
ballot drop box and requires such locations to be open for at least 7 hours each day
during that period for certain counties. Specifically, in a county whose population is
700,000 or more (currently only Clark County), a county clerk is required to
establish 10 such locations, and in a county whose population is 100,000 or more
but less than 700,000 (currently only Washoe County), a county clerk is required to
establish 5 such locations. Section 1 further authorizes a county clerk in a county
whose population is less than 100,000 (currently all counties other than Clark and
Washoe Counties) to establish any number of such locations and prescribe the
hours for such locations to be open. Section 2 of this bill provides that a mail ballot
dropped in a mail ballot drop box pursuant to section 1 counts as a vote in the
general election. Section 4 of this bill makes a conforming change to make certain
provisions relating to mail ballots generally applicable to section 1.
Existing law requires a ballot drop box to meet certain requirements, including
a requirement for the ballot drop box to be made available for use during the hours
when the office of the county or city clerk or the polling place is open for business
or voting, as applicable. (NRS 293.269921, 293C.26321) Sections 2 and 4.5 of this
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 2 –
bill require a ballot drop box to be: (1) monitored at all times during such a period;
and (2) secured during any period of time in which the ballot drop box is not
available for use. Sections 2 and 4.5 additionally require the Secretary of State to
adopt regulations to establish requirements for monitoring and securing ballot drop
boxes.
Existing law authorizes, at the request of a voter whose mail ballot has been
prepared by or on behalf of the voter, a person authorized by the voter to return the
mail ballot on behalf of the voter by mail or personal delivery to the county clerk,
or any ballot drop box established in the county by the county clerk. (NRS

Section 4:
293.269923) Section 3 of this bill additionally authorizes a person, under such
circumstances, to return a mail ballot on behalf of a voter by returning the mail
ballot to a mail ballot drop box established pursuant to section 1.
