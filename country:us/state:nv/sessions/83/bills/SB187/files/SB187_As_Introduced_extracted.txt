Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes an agent or officer of a law enforcement agency, an
2 officer of the local juvenile probation department or the local department of
3 juvenile services, or a designee of an agency which provides child welfare services
4 to place a child in protective custody: (1) with the consent of the parent or legal
5 guardian of the child; or (2) under certain circumstances indicating that the child is
6 in need of protection from injury, abuse or neglect. (NRS 432B.390) Under existing
7 law, within 72 hours after the placement of a child in protective custody, a court is
8 required to hold a hearing to determine whether the child should remain in
9 protective custody and, if so, where the child will be temporarily placed. (NRS
10 432B.470, 432B.480) If the court orders that the child remain in protective custody,
11 existing law requires the agency which provides child welfare services to file a
-
*SB187*
– 2 –
12 petition alleging that the child is in need of protection, unless good cause exists not
13 to file such a petition. (NRS 432B.490) Within 30 days after the filing of such a
14 petition, existing law requires the court to hold a hearing to determine the custody
15 and placement of the child. (NRS 432B.530, 432B.550) Existing law requires the
16 court to review such a placement at least semiannually and within 90 days after a
17 request by a party to any of the prior proceedings. (NRS 432B.580)
18 Section 2 of this bill requires an agency which provides child welfare services
19 to provide or deny consent to medical or mental health treatment for a child who is
20 in the custody of the agency within 14 days after such consent is requested. If the
21 consent of any other person or entity or a court order is required before such a child
22 may receive medical or mental health treatment, section 2 requires the agency
23 which provides child welfare services to: (1) make reasonable efforts to obtain such
24 consent or a court order within 14 days after the agency which provides child
25 welfare services becomes aware of the need for treatment; and (2) notify the person
26 or entity with whom the child is placed within 1 business day after obtaining the
27 consent or order or the denial of the consent or order, as applicable.
28 Existing law authorizes a court to: (1) temporarily place a child who is in
29 protective custody with certain relatives, pending a hearing on a petition alleging
30 that the child is in need of protection; and (2) place a child with a relative or fictive
31 kin at such a hearing. (NRS 432B.480, 432B.550) Sections 3, 11, 12 and 14 of this
32 bill authorize a court to place a child with a relative or fictive kin or continue such a
33 placement only if the court determines that the placement is in the best interests of
34 the child after considering certain factors relating to the ability of the relative or
35 fictive kin to meet the needs of the child. Sections 4, 5, 8-10 and 17 of this bill
36 make conforming changes to indicate the applicability of certain provisions that
37 apply generally to child welfare proceedings generally to section 3. Section 12
38 revises, from 1 year after the initial placement of a child who has been adjudicated
39 to be in need of protection outside the home to 6 months after such placement, the
40 authorized length of time for a search for a relative with whom to place the child.
41 Existing law requires an agency which provides child welfare services, any
42 other person or entity that places a child in protective custody, or a court, to place a
43 child who is in protective custody or has been adjudicated to be in need of
44 protection together with siblings whenever possible. (NRS 432B.390, 432B.3905,
45 432B.550) Sections 6, 7 and 12 of this bill provide that this requirement does not
46 apply where the child has abused or has been abused by a sibling.
47 Existing law defines “fictive kin” to mean a person who is not related by blood
48 to a child but who has a significant emotional and positive relationship with the
49 child. (NRS 432B.0657) Section 9 clarifies that a court is authorized to revoke the
50 appointment of a fictive kin as an educational decision maker if the person no
51 longer has a significant emotional and positive relationship with the child. Section
52 14 requires a court that is reviewing the placement of a child with a fictive kin to
53 determine whether the person continues to have a significant emotional and positive
54 relationship with the child.
55 Existing federal law establishes certain programs to provide grants of money to
56 states for certain purposes related to foster care, adoption assistance and other child
57 welfare programs. (42 U.S.C. §§ 621 et seq.; 42 U.S.C. §§ 670 et seq.) To be
58 eligible for such grants, existing federal law requires a state to have a plan for the
59 provision of child welfare services that satisfies certain requirements, including,
60 without limitation, the development of a case plan for each child receiving
61 assistance under the plan and a “case review system” with respect to such a child.
62 (42 U.S.C. § 622(b)(8)(A)(ii); 42 U.S.C. § 671(a)(16); 42 U.S.C. § 675(5)) Under
63 existing federal law, the “case review system” set forth in a state plan is required to
64 include, without limitation, a requirement that the State file a petition to terminate
65 the parental rights of the parents of a child if the child has been in foster care under
66 the responsibility of the State for 15 of the most recent 22 months, unless certain
-
*SB187*
– 3 –
67 exceptions apply. (42 U.S.C. § 675(5)(E)) Section 16 of this bill requires an agency
68 which provides child welfare services to file such a petition within that time period.
69 Sections 13, 15 and 18 of this bill accordingly revise certain provisions related to
70 the termination of parental rights to apply where a child has been placed outside of
71 the home and resided outside of the home pursuant to that placement for 15 months
72 of any 22 consecutive months, rather than for 14 of any 20 consecutive months.

28 protective custody:
29 (a) If the parent or legal guardian consents to the child being

1 that constitutes domestic violence pursuant to NRS 33.018, a
2 protective custody hearing must be held pursuant to NRS 432B.470,
3 whether the child was placed in protective custody or with a
4 relative. If an agency other than an agency which provides child
5 welfare services becomes aware that there is reasonable cause to
6 believe that the death of a parent of a child is or may be the result of

16 5. Before taking a child for placement in protective custody,
17 the person taking the child shall show his or her identification to any
18 person who is responsible for the child and is present at the time the
19 child is taken. If a person who is responsible for the child is not
20 present at the time the child is taken, the person taking the child
21 shall show his or her identification to any other person upon request.

24 identifies the person as a person authorized pursuant to this section
25 to place a child in protective custody.
26 6. A child placed in protective custody pending an
27 investigation and a hearing held pursuant to NRS 432B.470 must be
28 placed, except as otherwise provided in NRS 432B.3905, in the
29 following order of priority:
30 (a) In a hospital, if the child needs hospitalization.
31 (b) With a person who is related within the fifth degree of
32 consanguinity or a fictive kin, and who is suitable and able to
33 provide proper care and guidance for the child, regardless of
34 whether the relative or fictive kin resides within this State.
35 (c) In a foster home that is licensed pursuant to chapter 424 of
36 NRS.
37 (d) In any other licensed shelter that provides care to such
38 children.
39 7. [Whenever possible,] Unless there is a credible allegation
40 that a child being placed pursuant to subsection 6 has abused or
41 has been abused by a sibling of the child, whenever possible, the
42 child must be placed together with any siblings of the child. Such a
43 child must not be placed in a jail or other place for detention,
44 incarceration or residential care of persons convicted of a crime or
-
*SB187*
– 8 –
1 children charged with delinquent acts. As used in this subsection,
2 “abuse” means:
3 (a) Physical or mental injury of a nonaccidental nature under
4 circumstances which indicate that the child’s health or welfare is
5 harmed or threatened with harm;
6 (b) Sexual abuse or sexual exploitation; or
7 (c) Other harmful behavior that is terrorizing, degrading,

9 between siblings of similar age to the child and his or her sibling.
10 8. A person placing a child in protective custody pursuant to
11 subsection 1 shall:
12 (a) Immediately take steps to protect all other children
13 remaining in the home or facility, if necessary;
14 (b) Immediately make a reasonable effort to inform the person
15 responsible for the child’s welfare that the child has been placed in
16 protective custody; and
17 (c) As soon as practicable, inform the agency which provides
18 child welfare services and the appropriate law enforcement agency,
19 except that if the placement violates the provisions of NRS
20 432B.3905, the person shall immediately provide such notification.
21 9. If a child is placed with any person who resides outside this
22 State, the placement must be in accordance with NRS 127.330.
23 Sec. 7. NRS 432B.3905 is hereby amended to read as follows:
24 432B.3905 1. An employee of an agency which provides
25 child welfare services or its designee, an agent or officer of a law
26 enforcement agency, an officer of a local juvenile probation
27 department or the local department of juvenile services or any other
28 person who places a child in protective custody pursuant to this
29 chapter:
30 (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2, shall not
31 transfer a child who is under the age of 6 years to, or place such a
32 child in, a child care institution unless appropriate foster care is not
33 available at the time of placement in the county in which the child
34 resides; and
35 (b) Shall make all reasonable efforts to place siblings in the
36 same location [.] , unless there is a credible allegation that a
37 sibling has abused or has been abused by another sibling. As used
38 in this paragraph, “abuse” has the meaning ascribed to it in
39 subsection 7 of NRS 432B.390.
40 2. A child under the age of 6 years may be placed in a child
41 care institution:
42 (a) If the child requires medical services and such medical
43 services could not be provided at any other placement; or
44 (b) If necessary to avoid separating siblings.
-
*SB187*
– 9 –
1 3. If a child is transferred to or placed in a child care institution
2 in violation of subsection 1, the agency which provides child
3 welfare services that is responsible for the child shall immediately
4 notify the Director of the Department of Health and Human Services
5 and shall move the child to another placement as soon as possible.
6 4. Each agency which provides child welfare services shall
7 develop and implement a written plan to ensure that the provisions
8 of this section are understood and carried out.
9 5. As used in this section, “child care institution”:
10 (a) Means any type of home or facility that:
11 (1) Provides care and shelter during the day and night to 16
12 or more children who are in protective custody of an agency which
13 provides child welfare services; or

16 are in protective custody of an agency which provides child welfare
17 services.
18 (b) Does not include a home or facility that provides medical
19 services to children.
20 Sec. 8. NRS 432B.420 is hereby amended to read as follows:
21 432B.420 1. A parent or other person responsible for the
22 welfare of a child who is alleged to have abused or neglected the
23 child may be represented by an attorney at all stages of any
24 proceedings under NRS 432B.410 to 432B.590, inclusive [.] , and
25 section 3 of this act. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3,
26 if the person is indigent, the court may appoint an attorney to
27 represent the person.
28 2. A child who is alleged to have been abused or neglected
29 shall be deemed to be a party to any proceedings under NRS
30 432B.410 to 432B.590, inclusive [.] , and section 3 of this act. The
31 court shall appoint an attorney to represent the child. The child must
32 be represented by an attorney at all stages of any proceedings held
33 pursuant to NRS 432B.410 to 432B.590, inclusive [.] , and section 3
34 of this act. The attorney representing the child has the same
35 authority and rights as an attorney representing any other party to
36 the proceedings.
37 3. If the court determines that the parent of an Indian child for
38 whom protective custody is sought is indigent, the court:
39 (a) Shall appoint an attorney to represent the parent; and
40 (b) May apply to the Secretary of the Interior for the payment of
41 the fees and expenses of such an attorney,
42  as provided in the Indian Child Welfare Act.
43 4. Each attorney, other than an attorney compensated through a
44 program for legal aid described in NRS 19.031 and 247.305, if
45 appointed under the provisions of subsection 1 or 2, is entitled to the
-
*SB187*
– 10 –
1 same compensation and payment for expenses from the county as
2 provided in NRS 7.125 and 7.135 for an attorney appointed to
3 represent a person charged with a crime.
4 Sec. 9. NRS 432B.462 is hereby amended to read as follows:
5 432B.462 1. As soon as possible after a petition is filed
6 alleging that a child is in need of protection pursuant to NRS
7 432B.490 but no later than the date on which the disposition hearing
8 is held pursuant to subsection 5 of NRS 432B.530, the court shall
9 appoint an educational decision maker for the child.
10 2. There is a rebuttable presumption that it is in the best
11 interests of the child for the court to appoint a parent or guardian of
12 the child as the educational decision maker for the child. The court
13 may appoint a person other than a parent or guardian as an
14 educational decision maker for a child if, upon a motion from any
15 party, the court finds that:
16 (a) The parent or guardian of the child is unwilling or unable to
17 act as the educational decision maker for the child; or
18 (b) It is not in the best interests of the child for the parent or
19 legal guardian to act as the educational decision maker for the child.
20 3. If the court makes a finding described in subsection 2, the
21 court must appoint an educational decision maker for the child who
22 has the knowledge and skills to act in the best interests of the child
23 in all matters relating to the education of the child. Such a person
24 may include, without limitation:
25 (a) A relative of the child within the fifth degree of
26 consanguinity;
27 (b) The foster parent or other provider of substitute care for the
28 child;
29 (c) A fictive kin of the child;
30 (d) The guardian ad litem appointed for the child pursuant to
31 NRS 432B.500; or
32 (e) Another person whom the court determines is qualified to
33 perform the duties of an educational decision maker prescribed by
34 this section.
35 4. If possible, a person appointed as an educational decision
36 maker for a child pursuant to subsection 3 must be the permanent

42 432B.466 to 432B.468, inclusive; or
43 (3) The agency with legal custody of the child has produced
44 documentation of its conclusion that there is a compelling reason for
-
*SB187*
– 21 –
1 the placement of a child who has attained the age of 16 years in
2 another permanent living arrangement;
3 (c) If the child will not be returned to the parents of the child,
4 whether the agency with legal custody of the child fully considered
5 placement options both within and outside of this State;
6 (d) If the child has attained the age of 14 years, whether the
7 child will receive the services needed to assist the child in
8 transitioning to independent living; and
9 (e) If the child has been placed outside of this State, whether the
10 placement outside of this State continues to be appropriate for and in
11 the best interests of the child.
12 5. The court shall prepare an explicit statement of the facts
13 upon which each of its determinations is based pursuant to
14 subsection 4. If the court determines that it is not in the best interests
15 of the child to be returned to his or her parents, or to be placed for
16 adoption, with a legal guardian or with a relative, the court must
17 include compelling reasons for this determination and an
18 explanation of those reasons in its statement of the facts.
19 6. If the court determines that it is in the best interests of the
20 child to terminate parental rights, the court shall use its best efforts
21 to ensure that the procedures required by chapter 128 of NRS are
22 completed within 6 months after the date the court makes that
23 determination, including, without limitation, appointing a private
24 attorney to expedite the completion of the procedures.
25 7. The provisions of this section do not limit the jurisdiction of
26 the court to review any decisions of the agency with legal custody of
27 the child regarding the permanent placement of the child.
28 8. If a child has been placed outside of the home and has
29 resided outside of the home pursuant to that placement for [14] 15
30 months of any [20] 22 consecutive months, the best interests of the
31 child must be presumed to be served by the termination of parental
32 rights.
33 9. This hearing may take the place of the hearing for review
34 required by NRS 432B.580.
35 10. If a hearing pursuant to this section concerns a child who
36 has been placed in a qualified residential treatment program, the
37 hearing must include, without limitation, a review of that placement
38 conducted in the manner prescribed by NRS 432B.575.
39 11. The provision of notice and a right to be heard pursuant to
40 this section does not cause any person planning to adopt the child,
41 any sibling of the child or any other relative, any adoptive parent of
42 a sibling of the child or a provider of foster care to become a party
43 to the hearing.

1 Sec. 16. NRS 432B.5901 is hereby amended to read as
2 follows:
3 432B.5901 1. The provisions of chapter 128 of NRS, to the
4 extent they do not conflict with the provisions of NRS 432B.5901 to
5 432B.5908, inclusive, apply to all proceedings concerning the
6 termination of parental rights that are commenced pursuant to this
7 section by an agency which provides child welfare services.
8 2. If a child is determined to be a child in need of protection
9 pursuant to NRS 432B.550, an agency which provides child welfare
10 services [may,] :
11 (a) May, at any stage of a proceeding held pursuant to this
12 chapter, file a motion for the termination of parental rights as part of
13 the proceeding.
14 (b) Shall file a motion for the termination of parental rights if
15 the child has been placed outside of the home and has resided
16 outside of the home pursuant to that placement for 15 months of
17 any 22 consecutive months, unless the agency determines that:
18 (1) The child is in the care of a relative;
19 (2) The plan for the child requires the agency to make
20 reasonable efforts pursuant to NRS 432B.393 to reunify the family
21 of the child, and the agency has not provided to the family,
22 consistently within the period specified in the plan for the child,
23 such services as the agency deems necessary for the safe return of
24 the child to the home of the child; or
25 (3) There are compelling reasons, which are documented in
26 the plan for the child, for concluding that the filing of a petition to
27 terminate parental rights to the child would not be in the best
28 interests of the child.
29 Sec. 17. NRS 49.295 is hereby amended to read as follows:
30 49.295 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsections 2 and

33 against his or her spouse without his or her consent.

38 (a) Civil proceeding brought by or on behalf of one spouse
39 against the other spouse;
40 (b) Proceeding to commit or otherwise place a spouse, the
41 property of the spouse or both the spouse and the property of the
42 spouse under the control of another because of the alleged mental or
43 physical condition of the spouse;
44 (c) Proceeding brought by or on behalf of a spouse to establish
45 his or her competence;
-
*SB187*
– 23 –
1 (d) Proceeding in the juvenile court or family court pursuant to
2 title 5 of NRS or NRS 432B.410 to 432B.590, inclusive [;] , and
3 section 3 of this act; or
4 (e) Criminal proceeding in which one spouse is charged with:
5 (1) A crime against the person or the property of the other
6 spouse or of a child of either, or of a child in the custody or control
7 of either, whether the crime was committed before or during
8 marriage.
9 (2) Bigamy or incest.
10 (3) A crime related to abandonment of a child or nonsupport
11 of the other spouse or child.
12 3. The provisions of subsection 1 do not apply in any criminal
13 proceeding to events which took place before the spouses were
14 married.
15 Sec. 18. NRS 128.109 is hereby amended to read as follows:
16 128.109 1. If a child has been placed outside of his or her
17 home pursuant to chapter 432B of NRS, the following provisions
18 must be applied to determine the conduct of the parent:
19 (a) If the child has resided outside of his or her home pursuant to
20 that placement for [14] 15 months of any [20] 22 consecutive
21 months, it must be presumed that the parent or parents have
22 demonstrated only token efforts to care for the child as set forth in
23 subparagraph (6) of paragraph (b) of subsection 1 of NRS 128.105.
24 (b) If the parent or parents fail to comply substantially with the
25 terms and conditions of a plan to reunite the family within 6 months
26 after the date on which the child was placed or the plan was
27 commenced, whichever occurs later, that failure to comply is
28 evidence of failure of parental adjustment as set forth in
29 subparagraph (4) of paragraph (b) of subsection 1 of NRS 128.105.
30 2. If a child has been placed outside of his or her home
31 pursuant to chapter 432B of NRS and has resided outside of his or
32 her home pursuant to that placement for [14] 15 months of any [20]
33 22 consecutive months, the best interests of the child must be
34 presumed to be served by the termination of parental rights.
35 3. The presumptions specified in subsections 1 and 2 must not
36 be overcome or otherwise affected by evidence of failure of the
37 State to provide services to the family.

Raw Text:
S.B. 187
SENATE BILL NO. 187–SENATOR PAZINA
PREFILED FEBRUARY 3, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Health and Human Services
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to child welfare.
(BDR 38-15)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to child welfare; prescribing a time period within
which an agency which provides child welfare services is
required to take certain action relating to medical or
mental health treatment for a child in the custody of the
agency; revising requirements concerning the placement
of such a child; clarifying that a court may revoke the
appointment of a fictive kin as an educational decision
maker under certain circumstances; requiring a court that
is reviewing the placement of a child with a fictive kin to
consider certain factors; revising the requirement for an
agency which provides child welfare services to take
certain actions to terminate the parental rights of the
parents of a child under certain circumstances; revising
certain presumptions relating to the termination of
parental rights; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes an agent or officer of a law enforcement agency, an
2 officer of the local juvenile probation department or the local department of
3 juvenile services, or a designee of an agency which provides child welfare services
4 to place a child in protective custody: (1) with the consent of the parent or legal
5 guardian of the child; or (2) under certain circumstances indicating that the child is
6 in need of protection from injury, abuse or neglect. (NRS 432B.390) Under existing
7 law, within 72 hours after the placement of a child in protective custody, a court is
8 required to hold a hearing to determine whether the child should remain in
9 protective custody and, if so, where the child will be temporarily placed. (NRS
10 432B.470, 432B.480) If the court orders that the child remain in protective custody,
11 existing law requires the agency which provides child welfare services to file a
-
*SB187*

– 2 –
12 petition alleging that the child is in need of protection, unless good cause exists not
13 to file such a petition. (NRS 432B.490) Within 30 days after the filing of such a
14 petition, existing law requires the court to hold a hearing to determine the custody
15 and placement of the child. (NRS 432B.530, 432B.550) Existing law requires the
16 court to review such a placement at least semiannually and within 90 days after a
17 request by a party to any of the prior proceedings. (NRS 432B.580)
18 Section 2 of this bill requires an agency which provides child welfare services
19 to provide or deny consent to medical or mental health treatment for a child who is
20 in the custody of the agency within 14 days after such consent is requested. If the
21 consent of any other person or entity or a court order is required before such a child
22 may receive medical or mental health treatment, section 2 requires the agency
23 which provides child welfare services to: (1) make reasonable efforts to obtain such
24 consent or a court order within 14 days after the agency which provides child
25 welfare services becomes aware of the need for treatment; and (2) notify the person
26 or entity with whom the child is placed within 1 business day after obtaining the
27 consent or order or the denial of the consent or order, as applicable.
28 Existing law authorizes a court to: (1) temporarily place a child who is in
29 protective custody with certain relatives, pending a hearing on a petition alleging
30 that the child is in need of protection; and (2) place a child with a relative or fictive
31 kin at such a hearing. (NRS 432B.480, 432B.550) Sections 3, 11, 12 and 14 of this
32 bill authorize a court to place a child with a relative or fictive kin or continue such a
33 placement only if the court determines that the placement is in the best interests of
34 the child after considering certain factors relating to the ability of the relative or
35 fictive kin to meet the needs of the child. Sections 4, 5, 8-10 and 17 of this bill
36 make conforming changes to indicate the applicability of certain provisions that
37 apply generally to child welfare proceedings generally to section 3. Section 12
38 revises, from 1 year after the initial placement of a child who has been adjudicated
39 to be in need of protection outside the home to 6 months after such placement, the
40 authorized length of time for a search for a relative with whom to place the child.
41 Existing law requires an agency which provides child welfare services, any
42 other person or entity that places a child in protective custody, or a court, to place a
43 child who is in protective custody or has been adjudicated to be in need of
44 protection together with siblings whenever possible. (NRS 432B.390, 432B.3905,
45 432B.550) Sections 6, 7 and 12 of this bill provide that this requirement does not
46 apply where the child has abused or has been abused by a sibling.
47 Existing law defines “fictive kin” to mean a person who is not related by blood
48 to a child but who has a significant emotional and positive relationship with the
49 child. (NRS 432B.0657) Section 9 clarifies that a court is authorized to revoke the
50 appointment of a fictive kin as an educational decision maker if the person no
51 longer has a significant emotional and positive relationship with the child. Section
52 14 requires a court that is reviewing the placement of a child with a fictive kin to
53 determine whether the person continues to have a significant emotional and positive
54 relationship with the child.
55 Existing federal law establishes certain programs to provide grants of money to
56 states for certain purposes related to foster care, adoption assistance and other child
57 welfare programs. (42 U.S.C. §§ 621 et seq.; 42 U.S.C. §§ 670 et seq.) To be
58 eligible for such grants, existing federal law requires a state to have a plan for the
59 provision of child welfare services that satisfies certain requirements, including,
60 without limitation, the development of a case plan for each child receiving
61 assistance under the plan and a “case review system” with respect to such a child.
62 (42 U.S.C. § 622(b)(8)(A)(ii); 42 U.S.C. § 671(a)(16); 42 U.S.C. § 675(5)) Under
63 existing federal law, the “case review system” set forth in a state plan is required to
64 include, without limitation, a requirement that the State file a petition to terminate
65 the parental rights of the parents of a child if the child has been in foster care under
66 the responsibility of the State for 15 of the most recent 22 months, unless certain
-
*SB187*

– 3 –
67 exceptions apply. (42 U.S.C. § 675(5)(E)) Section 16 of this bill requires an agency
68 which provides child welfare services to file such a petition within that time period.
69 Sections 13, 15 and 18 of this bill accordingly revise certain provisions related to
70 the termination of parental rights to apply where a child has been placed outside of
71 the home and resided outside of the home pursuant to that placement for 15 months
72 of any 22 consecutive months, rather than for 14 of any 20 consecutive months.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 432B of NRS is hereby amended by adding
2 thereto the provisions set forth as sections 2 and 3 of this act.

4 services is required to provide consent before a child who is in the
5 custody of the agency may receive medical or mental health
6 treatment, the agency which provides child welfare services shall
7 provide or deny such consent not later than 14 days after such
8 consent is requested.
9 2. If any person or entity, including, without limitation, a
10 person legally responsible for the psychiatric care of a child
11 appointed pursuant to NRS 432B.4685, is required to provide
12 consent before a child who is in the custody of an agency which
13 provides child welfare services may receive medical or mental
14 health treatment, the agency which provides child welfare services
15 shall:
16 (a) Make reasonable efforts to obtain such consent not later
17 than 14 days after the agency which provides child welfare
18 services becomes aware of the need for the treatment; and
19 (b) Notify the person or entity with whom the child is placed
20 within 1 business day after obtaining such consent or the denial of
21 such consent.
22 3. If an order of the court is required before a child who is in
23 the custody of an agency which provides child welfare services
24 may receive medical or mental health treatment, the agency which
25 provides child welfare services shall:
26 (a) Make reasonable efforts to obtain such an order not later
27 than 14 days after the agency which provides child welfare

20 Sec. 8. NRS 432B.420 is hereby amended to read as follows:
21 432B.420 1. A parent or other person responsible for the
22 welfare of a child who is alleged to have abused or neglected the
23 child may be represented by an attorney at all stages of any
24 proceedings under NRS 432B.410 to 432B.590, inclusive [.] , and

29 shall be deemed to be a party to any proceedings under NRS
30 432B.410 to 432B.590, inclusive [.] , and section 3 of this act. The
31 court shall appoint an attorney to represent the child. The child must

4 Sec. 9. NRS 432B.462 is hereby amended to read as follows:
5 432B.462 1. As soon as possible after a petition is filed
6 alleging that a child is in need of protection pursuant to NRS

8 is held pursuant to subsection 5 of NRS 432B.530, the court shall
9 appoint an educational decision maker for the child.
10 2. There is a rebuttable presumption that it is in the best
11 interests of the child for the court to appoint a parent or guardian of
12 the child as the educational decision maker for the child. The court
13 may appoint a person other than a parent or guardian as an
14 educational decision maker for a child if, upon a motion from any
15 party, the court finds that:
16 (a) The parent or guardian of the child is unwilling or unable to
17 act as the educational decision maker for the child; or
18 (b) It is not in the best interests of the child for the parent or

34 this section.
35 4. If possible, a person appointed as an educational decision
36 maker for a child pursuant to subsection 3 must be the permanent
37 caregiver recommended for the child in the plan for permanent
38 placement adopted pursuant to NRS 432B.553.
39 5. The fact that a person other than the parent or guardian of a
40 child is appointed as an educational decision maker pursuant to this
41 section must not be used in any proceeding as evidence that the
42 person is an unfit parent or unfit to be the guardian of the child.
43 6. An educational decision maker appointed pursuant to this
44 section shall not be deemed to be an employee of a public agency
45 involved in the education of the child.
-
*SB187*

– 11 –
1 7. An educational decision maker shall:
2 (a) Have an initial meeting with the child and then shall meet

5 interests of the child;
6 (b) Address any disciplinary issues relating to the education of
7 the child with the child and the school in which the child is enrolled;

9 education in accordance with federal and state law, including,

11 (1) Any special programs of instruction or special services
12 for pupils with disabilities to which the child is entitled by federal or
13 state law; and
14 (2) If the child is at least 14 years of age, educational

19 (e) Participate in any meeting relating to the education of the
20 child, including, without limitation, a meeting regarding any
21 individualized education program established for the pupil pursuant
22 to 20 U.S.C. § 1414(d) or special program of instruction or special
23 service provided to the pupil;
24 (f) To the extent practicable, communicate any concerns he or
25 she has regarding the educational placement of the child and the
26 educational services provided to the child and any recommendations
27 to address those concerns to:
28 (1) The agency which provides child welfare services;
29 (2) The attorney representing the child; and
30 (3) If the educational decision maker for the child is not the
31 parent or guardian of the child, the parent or guardian of the child;
32 and
33 (g) Appear at any proceeding held pursuant to this section and
34 NRS 432B.410 to 432B.590, inclusive, and section 3 of this act and
35 make specific recommendations to the court as appropriate
36 concerning the educational placement of the child, the educational
37 services provided to the child and, if the child is at least 14 years of
38 age, the services needed to assist the child in transitioning to
39 independent living.
40 8. A court may revoke the appointment of an educational
41 decision maker if the court determines the revocation of the
42 appointment is in the best interests of the child. A court may
43 determine that the revocation of the appointment of a fictive kin as
44 an educational decision maker is in the best interests of the child if
45 that person no longer has a significant emotional and positive
-
*SB187*

– 12 –
1 relationship with the child. If the court revokes such an
2 appointment, the court must appoint a new educational decision
3 maker for the child.
4 9. An educational decision maker appointed for a child
5 pursuant to this section shall be deemed to be a surrogate parent for
6 the purposes of 34 C.F.R. § 300.519.

32 (b) The court shall determine whether there is reasonable cause

34 (1) Contrary to the welfare of the child for the child to reside
35 at his or her home; or
36 (2) In the best interests of the child to place the child outside
37 of his or her home.
38  The court shall prepare an explicit statement of the facts upon
39 which each of its determinations is based. The court shall not make
40 an affirmative finding regarding either subparagraph (1) or (2)

2 act, place the child in the temporary or permanent custody of a
3 relative, a fictive kin or other person the court finds suitable to
4 receive and care for the child with or without supervision, and with
5 or without retaining jurisdiction of the case, upon such conditions as
6 the court may prescribe; or
7 (c) Place the child in the temporary custody of a public agency
8 or institution authorized to care for children, the local juvenile
9 probation department, the local department of juvenile services or a
10 private agency or institution licensed by the Department of Health
11 and Human Services or a county whose population is 100,000 or
12 more to care for such a child.
13  In carrying out this subsection, the court may, in its sole
14 discretion and in compliance with the requirements of chapter 159A
15 of NRS, consider an application for the guardianship of the child. If
16 the court grants such an application, it may retain jurisdiction of the
17 case or transfer the case to another court of competent jurisdiction.
18 2. The court shall not deny placement of a child in the
19 temporary or permanent custody of a person pursuant to subsection
20 1 solely because the person:
21 (a) Is deaf, is blind or has another physical disability; or
22 (b) Is the holder of a valid registry identification card.
23 3. If, pursuant to subsection 1, a child is placed other than with
24 a parent:
25 (a) The parent retains the right to consent to adoption, to
26 determine the child’s religious affiliation and to reasonable
27 visitation, unless restricted by the court. If the custodian of the child
28 interferes with these rights, the parent may petition the court for
29 enforcement of the rights of the parent.
30 (b) The court shall set forth good cause why the child was
31 placed other than with a parent.
32 4. If, pursuant to subsection 1, the child is to be placed with a
33 relative or fictive kin, the court may consider, among other factors
34 [,] and in addition to the factors prescribed by section 3 of this act,
35 whether the child has resided with a particular relative or fictive kin
36 for 3 years or more before the incident which brought the child to
37 the court’s attention.
38 5. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, a copy of
39 the report prepared for the court by the agency which provides child
40 welfare services must be sent to the custodian and the parent or legal
41 guardian. If the child was delivered to a provider of emergency
42 services pursuant to NRS 432B.630:
43 (a) The parent who delivered the child to the provider shall be
44 deemed to have waived his or her right to a copy of the report; and

1 (b) A copy of the report must be sent to the parent who did not
2 deliver the child to the provider, if the location of such parent is
3 known.
4 6. In determining the placement of a child pursuant to this
5 section, if the child is not permitted to remain in the custody of the
6 parents of the child or guardian:
7 (a) It must be presumed to be in the best interests of the child to
8 be placed together with the siblings of the child [.] , unless there is
9 a credible allegation that the child has abused or has been abused
10 by a sibling of the child. As used in this paragraph, “abuse” has
11 the meaning ascribed to it in subsection 7 of NRS 432B.390.
12 (b) Preference must be given to placing the child in the
13 following order:
14 (1) With any person related within the fifth degree of
15 consanguinity to the child or a fictive kin, and who is suitable and
16 able to provide proper care and guidance for the child, regardless of
17 whether the relative or fictive kin resides within this State.
18 (2) In a foster home that is licensed pursuant to chapter 424
19 of NRS.
20 7. Any search for a relative with whom to place a child
21 pursuant to this section must be completed within [1 year] 6 months
22 after the initial placement of the child outside of the home of the
23 child. If a child is placed with any person who resides outside of this
24 State, the placement must be in accordance with NRS 127.330.
25 8. Within 60 days after the removal of a child from the home of
26 the child, the court shall:
27 (a) Determine whether:
28 (1) The agency which provides child welfare services has
29 made the reasonable efforts required by paragraph (a) of subsection
30 1 of NRS 432B.393; or
31 (2) No such efforts are required in the particular case; and
32 (b) Prepare an explicit statement of the facts upon which its
33 determination is based.
34 9. As used in this section:
35 (a) “Blind” has the meaning ascribed to it in NRS 426.082.

37 person who holds a valid registry identification card as defined in
38 NRS 678C.080 that identifies the person as:

11 [20] 22 months, the agency shall include the termination of parental
12 rights to the child in the plan for the permanent placement of the
13 child, unless the agency determines that:
14 (a) The child is in the care of a relative;
15 (b) The plan for the child requires the agency to make

13 (c) Information concerning the child’s education, including:
