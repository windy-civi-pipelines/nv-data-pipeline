AN ACT relating to child welfare; prescribing a time period within which an
agency which provides child welfare services is required to take certain
action relating to certain medical or mental health treatment for a child
in the custody of the agency; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes an agent or officer of a law enforcement agency, an officer of the
2 local juvenile probation department or the local department of juvenile services, or a designee
3 of an agency which provides child welfare services to place a child in protective custody: (1)
4 with the consent of the parent or legal guardian of the child; or (2) under certain circumstances
5 indicating that the child is in need of protection from injury, abuse or neglect. (NRS
6 432B.390) Under existing law, within 72 hours after the placement of a child in protective
7 custody, a court is required to hold a hearing to determine whether the child should remain in
8 protective custody and, if so, where the child will be temporarily placed. (NRS 432B.470,
9 432B.480) If the court orders that the child remain in protective custody, existing law requires
10 the agency which provides child welfare services to file a petition alleging that the child is in
11 need of protection, unless good cause exists not to file such a petition. (NRS 432B.490)
12 Within 30 days after the filing of such a petition, existing law requires the court to hold a
13 hearing to determine the custody and placement of the child. (NRS 432B.530, 432B.550)
14 Existing law requires the court to review such a placement at least semiannually and within 90
15 days after a request by a party to any of the prior proceedings. (NRS 432B.580)
16 Section 2 of this bill requires an agency which provides child welfare services to provide
17 or deny consent to non-emergency medical [or mental health treatment] care that is
18 recommended by a provider of health care for a child who is in the custody of the agency
19 within 14 days after [such consent is requested.] the caseworker assigned to the child
20 receives written notice of the recommendation or referral for such care. If the consent of
21 any other person or entity [or a court order] is required before such a child may receive
22 medical or mental health treatment, section 2 requires the agency which provides child
23 welfare services to [: (1)] make reasonable efforts to [initiate] obtain such consent [or a court
24 order] within 14 days after the [agency which provides child welfare services becomes aware]
25 caseworker assigned to the child receives written notice of the need for treatment . [; and
26 (2)] If a court order is required before such a child may receive non-emergency medical
27 care recommended by a provider of health care, section 2 requires the agency which
28 provides child welfare services to make reasonable efforts to initiate such an order not
29 later than 14 days after the caseworker assigned to the child receives written notice of
30 the recommendation or referral for such care. Section 2 requires the agency which

Assembly Amendment No. 594 to Senate Bill No. 187 First Reprint Page 4
31 provides child welfare services to notify the person or entity with whom the child is placed
32 [within 3 business days] as soon as practicable and without delay after obtaining [the
33 consent or] such an order or the denial of [the consent or] a request for such an order, as
34 applicable.

7 shall provide or deny such consent not later than 14 days after [such consent is
8 requested.] the caseworker assigned to the child receives written notice of the
9 recommendation or referral for such care.

35 standing from seeking a court order for the medical treatment of a child in the
36 custody of a child welfare agency.
37 5. As used in this section, “provider of health care” has the meaning
38 ascribed to it in NRS 629.031.
