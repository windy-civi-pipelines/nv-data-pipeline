AN ACT relating to child welfare; prescribing a time period within
which an agency which provides child welfare services is
required to take certain action relating to medical or
mental health treatment for a child in the custody of the
agency; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes an agent or officer of a law enforcement agency, an
2 officer of the local juvenile probation department or the local department of
3 juvenile services, or a designee of an agency which provides child welfare services
4 to place a child in protective custody: (1) with the consent of the parent or legal
5 guardian of the child; or (2) under certain circumstances indicating that the child is
6 in need of protection from injury, abuse or neglect. (NRS 432B.390) Under existing
7 law, within 72 hours after the placement of a child in protective custody, a court is
8 required to hold a hearing to determine whether the child should remain in
9 protective custody and, if so, where the child will be temporarily placed. (NRS
10 432B.470, 432B.480) If the court orders that the child remain in protective custody,
11 existing law requires the agency which provides child welfare services to file a
12 petition alleging that the child is in need of protection, unless good cause exists not
13 to file such a petition. (NRS 432B.490) Within 30 days after the filing of such a
14 petition, existing law requires the court to hold a hearing to determine the custody
15 and placement of the child. (NRS 432B.530, 432B.550) Existing law requires the
16 court to review such a placement at least semiannually and within 90 days after a
17 request by a party to any of the prior proceedings. (NRS 432B.580)
18 Section 2 of this bill requires an agency which provides child welfare services
19 to provide or deny consent to medical or mental health treatment for a child who is
20 in the custody of the agency within 14 days after such consent is requested. If the
21 consent of any other person or entity or a court order is required before such a child
22 may receive medical or mental health treatment, section 2 requires the agency
23 which provides child welfare services to: (1) make reasonable efforts to initiate

24 such consent or a court order within 14 days after the agency which provides child
25 welfare services becomes aware of the need for treatment; and (2) notify the person
26 or entity with whom the child is placed within 3 business days after obtaining the
27 consent or order or the denial of the consent or order, as applicable.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 432B of NRS is hereby amended by adding
2 thereto the provisions set forth as sections 2 and 3 of this act.

4 services is required to provide consent before a child who is in the
5 custody of the agency may receive medical or mental health
6 treatment, the agency which provides child welfare services shall
7 provide or deny such consent not later than 14 days after such
8 consent is requested.
9 2. If any person or entity, including, without limitation, a
10 person legally responsible for the psychiatric care of a child
11 appointed pursuant to NRS 432B.4685, is required to provide
12 consent before a child who is in the custody of an agency which
13 provides child welfare services may receive medical or mental
14 health treatment, the agency which provides child welfare services
15 shall:
16 (a) Make reasonable efforts to obtain such consent not later
17 than 14 days after the agency which provides child welfare
18 services becomes aware of the need for the treatment; and
19 (b) Notify the person or entity with whom the child is placed
20 within 3 business days after obtaining such consent or the denial
21 of such consent.
22 3. If an order of the court is required before a child who is in
23 the custody of an agency which provides child welfare services
24 may receive medical or mental health treatment, the agency which
25 provides child welfare services shall:
26 (a) Make reasonable efforts to initiate such an order not later
27 than 14 days after the agency which provides child welfare
28 services becomes aware of the need for the treatment; and
