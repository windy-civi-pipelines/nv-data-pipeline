EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to child welfare; prescribing a time period within
which an agency which provides child welfare services is
required to take certain action relating to certain medical
or mental health treatment for a child in the custody of the
agency; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes an agent or officer of a law enforcement agency, an
2 officer of the local juvenile probation department or the local department of
3 juvenile services, or a designee of an agency which provides child welfare services
4 to place a child in protective custody: (1) with the consent of the parent or legal
5 guardian of the child; or (2) under certain circumstances indicating that the child is
6 in need of protection from injury, abuse or neglect. (NRS 432B.390) Under existing
7 law, within 72 hours after the placement of a child in protective custody, a court is
8 required to hold a hearing to determine whether the child should remain in
9 protective custody and, if so, where the child will be temporarily placed. (NRS
10 432B.470, 432B.480) If the court orders that the child remain in protective custody,
11 existing law requires the agency which provides child welfare services to file a
12 petition alleging that the child is in need of protection, unless good cause exists not
13 to file such a petition. (NRS 432B.490) Within 30 days after the filing of such a
14 petition, existing law requires the court to hold a hearing to determine the custody
15 and placement of the child. (NRS 432B.530, 432B.550) Existing law requires the
16 court to review such a placement at least semiannually and within 90 days after a
17 request by a party to any of the prior proceedings. (NRS 432B.580)
18 Section 2 of this bill requires an agency which provides child welfare services
19 to provide or deny consent to non-emergency medical care that is recommended by
20 a provider of health care for a child who is in the custody of the agency within 14
21 days after the caseworker assigned to the child receives written notice of the
22 recommendation or referral for such care. If the consent of any other person or
23 entity is required before such a child may receive medical or mental health

24 treatment, section 2 requires the agency which provides child welfare services to
25 make reasonable efforts to obtain such consent within 14 days after the caseworker
26 assigned to the child receives written notice of the need for treatment. If a court
27 order is required before such a child may receive non-emergency medical care
28 recommended by a provider of health care, section 2 requires the agency which
29 provides child welfare services to make reasonable efforts to initiate such an order
30 not later than 14 days after the caseworker assigned to the child receives written
31 notice of the recommendation or referral for such care. Section 2 requires the
32 agency which provides child welfare services to notify the person or entity with
33 whom the child is placed as soon as practicable and without delay after obtaining
34 such an order or the denial of a request for such an order, as applicable.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 432B of NRS is hereby amended by adding
2 thereto the provisions set forth as sections 2 and 3 of this act.
3 Sec. 2. 1. If an agency which provides child welfare
4 services is required to provide consent before a child who is in the
5 custody of the agency may receive non-emergency medical care
6 that is recommended by a provider of health care, the agency
7 which provides child welfare services shall provide or deny such
8 consent not later than 14 days after the caseworker assigned to the
9 child receives written notice of the recommendation or referral for
10 such care.
11 2. If any person or entity, including, without limitation, a
12 person legally responsible for the psychiatric care of a child
13 appointed pursuant to NRS 432B.4685, is required to provide
14 consent before a child who is in the custody of an agency which
15 provides child welfare services may receive medical or mental
16 health treatment, the agency which provides child welfare services
17 shall:
18 (a) Make reasonable efforts to obtain such consent not later
19 than 14 days after the caseworker assigned to the child receives
20 written notice of the need for the treatment, which may be
21 demonstrated by, without limitation, a referral for the treatment;
22 and
23 (b) Notify the person or entity with whom the child is placed as
24 soon as practicable and without delay after obtaining such consent
25 or the denial of such consent.
26 3. If an order of the court is required before a child who is in
27 the custody of an agency which provides child welfare services
28 may receive non-emergency medical care that is recommended by
29 a provider of health care, the agency which provides child welfare
30 services shall:

6 soon as practicable and without delay after obtaining such an
7 order or the denial of a request for such an order.

10 medical treatment of a child in the custody of a child welfare
11 agency.
