EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to child welfare; prescribing a time period within which an
agency which provides child welfare services is required to take certain
action relating to medical or mental health treatment for a child in the
custody of the agency; [revising requirements concerning the
placement of such a child; clarifying that a court may revoke the
appointment of a fictive kin as an educational decision maker under
certain circumstances; requiring a court that is reviewing the placement
of a child with a fictive kin to consider certain factors; revising the
requirement for an agency which provides child welfare services to
take certain actions to terminate the parental rights of the parents of a
child under certain circumstances; revising certain presumptions
relating to the termination of parental rights;] and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes an agent or officer of a law enforcement agency, an officer of the
2 local juvenile probation department or the local department of juvenile services, or a designee
3 of an agency which provides child welfare services to place a child in protective custody: (1)
4 with the consent of the parent or legal guardian of the child; or (2) under certain circumstances
5 indicating that the child is in need of protection from injury, abuse or neglect. (NRS
6 432B.390) Under existing law, within 72 hours after the placement of a child in protective
7 custody, a court is required to hold a hearing to determine whether the child should remain in
8 protective custody and, if so, where the child will be temporarily placed. (NRS 432B.470,
9 432B.480) If the court orders that the child remain in protective custody, existing law requires
10 the agency which provides child welfare services to file a petition alleging that the child is in
11 need of protection, unless good cause exists not to file such a petition. (NRS 432B.490)
12 Within 30 days after the filing of such a petition, existing law requires the court to hold a
13 hearing to determine the custody and placement of the child. (NRS 432B.530, 432B.550)
14 Existing law requires the court to review such a placement at least semiannually and within 90
15 days after a request by a party to any of the prior proceedings. (NRS 432B.580)
16 Section 2 of this bill requires an agency which provides child welfare services to provide
17 or deny consent to medical or mental health treatment for a child who is in the custody of the
18 agency within 14 days after such consent is requested. If the consent of any other person or
19 entity or a court order is required before such a child may receive medical or mental health
20 treatment, section 2 requires the agency which provides child welfare services to: (1) make
Senate Amendment No. 217 to Senate Bill No. 187 Page 4
21 reasonable efforts to [obtain] initiate such consent or a court order within 14 days after the
22 agency which provides child welfare services becomes aware of the need for treatment; and
23 (2) notify the person or entity with whom the child is placed within [1] 3 business [day] days
24 after obtaining the consent or order or the denial of the consent or order, as applicable.
25 [Existing law authorizes a court to: (1) temporarily place a child who is in protective
26 custody with certain relatives, pending a hearing on a petition alleging that the child is in need
27 of protection; and (2) place a child with a relative or fictive kin at such a hearing. (NRS
28 432B.480, 432B.550) Sections 3, 11, 12 and 14 of this bill authorize a court to place a child
29 with a relative or fictive kin or continue such a placement only if the court determines that the
30 placement is in the best interests of the child after considering certain factors relating to the
31 ability of the relative or fictive kin to meet the needs of the child. Sections 4, 5, 8-10 and 17 of
32 this bill make conforming changes to indicate the applicability of certain provisions that apply
33 generally to child welfare proceedings generally to section 3. Section 12 revises, from 1 year
34 after the initial placement of a child who has been adjudicated to be in need of protection
35 outside the home to 6 months after such placement, the authorized length of time for a search
36 for a relative with whom to place the child.
37 Existing law requires an agency which provides child welfare services, any other person
38 or entity that places a child in protective custody, or a court, to place a child who is in
39 protective custody or has been adjudicated to be in need of protection together with siblings
40 whenever possible. (NRS 432B.390, 432B.3905, 432B.550) Sections 6, 7 and 12 of this bill
41 provide that this requirement does not apply where the child has abused or has been abused by
42 a sibling.
43 Existing law defines “fictive kin” to mean a person who is not related by blood to a child
44 but who has a significant emotional and positive relationship with the child. (NRS 432B.0657)
45 Section 9 clarifies that a court is authorized to revoke the appointment of a fictive kin as an
46 educational decision maker if the person no longer has a significant emotional and positive
47 relationship with the child. Section 14 requires a court that is reviewing the placement of a
48 child with a fictive kin to determine whether the person continues to have a significant
49 emotional and positive relationship with the child.
50 Existing federal law establishes certain programs to provide grants of money to states for
51 certain purposes related to foster care, adoption assistance and other child welfare programs.
52 (42 U.S.C. §§ 621 et seq.; 42 U.S.C. §§ 670 et seq.) To be eligible for such grants, existing
53 federal law requires a state to have a plan for the provision of child welfare services that
54 satisfies certain requirements, including, without limitation, the development of a case plan
55 for each child receiving assistance under the plan and a “case review system” with respect to
56 such a child. (42 U.S.C. § 622(b)(8)(A)(ii); 42 U.S.C. § 671(a)(16); 42 U.S.C. § 675(5))
57 Under existing federal law, the “case review system” set forth in a state plan is required to
58 include, without limitation, a requirement that the State file a petition to terminate the parental
59 rights of the parents of a child if the child has been in foster care under the responsibility of
60 the State for 15 of the most recent 22 months, unless certain exceptions apply. (42 U.S.C. §
61 675(5)(E)) Section 16 of this bill requires an agency which provides child welfare services to
62 file such a petition within that time period. Sections 13, 15 and 18 of this bill accordingly
63 revise certain provisions related to the termination of parental rights to apply where a child
64 has been placed outside of the home and resided outside of the home pursuant to that
65 placement for 15 months of any 22 consecutive months, rather than for 14 of any 20
66 consecutive months.]

5 Sec. 5. [NRS 432B.260 is hereby amended to read as follows:
6 432B.260 1. Upon the receipt of a report concerning the possible abuse or

21 agency which provides child welfare services shall conduct an evaluation not later

39 constitute abuse or neglect as described in NRS 432B.150.

9 determines that there is a serious risk to the health or safety of the child.
10 8. If an agency which provides child welfare services determines pursuant to
11 subsection 3 that an investigation is not warranted, the agency may, at any time,
12 reverse that determination and initiate an investigation.

14 agency shall cooperate in the investigation, if any, of a report of abuse or neglect of

38 NRS 432B.470, whether the child was placed in protective custody or with a
39 relative. If an agency other than an agency which provides child welfare services
40 becomes aware that there is reasonable cause to believe that the death of a parent of

43 which provides child welfare services and a protective custody hearing must be
44 scheduled.
45 4. An agency which provides child welfare services shall request the

52 for the child is not present at the time the child is taken, the person taking the child
53 shall show his or her identification to any other person upon request. The
Senate Amendment No. 217 to Senate Bill No. 187 Page 8
1 identification required by this subsection must be a single card that contains a
2 photograph of the person taking the child and identifies the person as a person
3 authorized pursuant to this section to place a child in protective custody.
4 6. A child placed in protective custody pending an investigation and a hearing
5 held pursuant to NRS 432B.470 must be placed, except as otherwise provided in
6 NRS 432B.3905, in the following order of priority:
7 (a) In a hospital, if the child needs hospitalization.
8 (b) With a person who is related within the fifth degree of consanguinity or a

11 (c) In a foster home that is licensed pursuant to chapter 424 of NRS.
12 (d) In any other licensed shelter that provides care to such children.
13 7. [Whenever possible,] Unless there is a credible allegation that a child
14 being placed pursuant to subsection 6 has abused or has been abused by a sibling
15 of the child, whenever possible, the child must be placed together with any siblings
16 of the child. Such a child must not be placed in a jail or other place for detention,
17 incarceration or residential care of persons convicted of a crime or children charged
18 with delinquent acts. As used in this subsection, “abuse” means:

20 which indicate that the child’s health or welfare is harmed or threatened with
21 harm;
22 (b) Sexual abuse or sexual exploitation; or
23 (c) Other harmful behavior that is terrorizing, degrading, painful or
24 emotionally traumatic and is atypical of interactions between siblings of similar
25 age to the child and his or her sibling.
26 8. A person placing a child in protective custody pursuant to subsection 1
27 shall:
28 (a) Immediately take steps to protect all other children remaining in the home
29 or facility, if necessary;
30 (b) Immediately make a reasonable effort to inform the person responsible for
31 the child’s welfare that the child has been placed in protective custody; and
32 (c) As soon as practicable, inform the agency which provides child welfare
33 services and the appropriate law enforcement agency, except that if the placement
34 violates the provisions of NRS 432B.3905, the person shall immediately provide
35 such notification.
36 9. If a child is placed with any person who resides outside this State, the
37 placement must be in accordance with NRS 127.330.] (Deleted by amendment.)

43 chapter:
44 (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2, shall not transfer a child who
45 is under the age of 6 years to, or place such a child in, a child care institution unless
46 appropriate foster care is not available at the time of placement in the county in
47 which the child resides; and
48 (b) Shall make all reasonable efforts to place siblings in the same location [.] ,
49 unless there is a credible allegation that a sibling has abused or has been abused
50 by another sibling. As used in this paragraph, “abuse” has the meaning ascribed

52 2. A child under the age of 6 years may be placed in a child care institution:
Senate Amendment No. 217 to Senate Bill No. 187 Page 9
1 (a) If the child requires medical services and such medical services could not
2 be provided at any other placement; or
3 (b) If necessary to avoid separating siblings.
4 3. If a child is transferred to or placed in a child care institution in violation of
5 subsection 1, the agency which provides child welfare services that is responsible
6 for the child shall immediately notify the Director of the Department of Health and
7 Human Services and shall move the child to another placement as soon as possible.
8 4. Each agency which provides child welfare services shall develop and
9 implement a written plan to ensure that the provisions of this section are understood
10 and carried out.
11 5. As used in this section, “child care institution”:
12 (a) Means any type of home or facility that:
13 (1) Provides care and shelter during the day and night to 16 or more

17 caregivers who work in shifts, to children who are in protective custody of an
18 agency which provides child welfare services.
19 (b) Does not include a home or facility that provides medical services to

21 Sec. 8. [NRS 432B.420 is hereby amended to read as follows:
22 432B.420 1. A parent or other person responsible for the welfare of a child
23 who is alleged to have abused or neglected the child may be represented by an
24 attorney at all stages of any proceedings under NRS 432B.410 to 432B.590,
25 inclusive [.] , and section 3 of this act. Except as otherwise provided in subsection
26 3, if the person is indigent, the court may appoint an attorney to represent the
27 person.
28 2. A child who is alleged to have been abused or neglected shall be deemed to
29 be a party to any proceedings under NRS 432B.410 to 432B.590, inclusive [.] , and
30 section 3 of this act. The court shall appoint an attorney to represent the child. The
31 child must be represented by an attorney at all stages of any proceedings held
32 pursuant to NRS 432B.410 to 432B.590, inclusive [.] , and section 3 of this act.
33 The attorney representing the child has the same authority and rights as an attorney
34 representing any other party to the proceedings.

36 protective custody is sought is indigent, the court:
37 (a) Shall appoint an attorney to represent the parent; and

43 of subsection 1 or 2, is entitled to the same compensation and payment for expenses
44 from the county as provided in NRS 7.125 and 7.135 for an attorney appointed to
45 represent a person charged with a crime.] (Deleted by amendment.)
46 Sec. 9. [NRS 432B.462 is hereby amended to read as follows:
47 432B.462 1. As soon as possible after a petition is filed alleging that a child

49 which the disposition hearing is held pursuant to subsection 5 of NRS 432B.530,
50 the court shall appoint an educational decision maker for the child.
51 2. There is a rebuttable presumption that it is in the best interests of the child
52 for the court to appoint a parent or guardian of the child as the educational decision
53 maker for the child. The court may appoint a person other than a parent or guardian
Senate Amendment No. 217 to Senate Bill No. 187 Page 10
1 as an educational decision maker for a child if, upon a motion from any party, the
2 court finds that:
3 (a) The parent or guardian of the child is unwilling or unable to act as the
4 educational decision maker for the child; or
5 (b) It is not in the best interests of the child for the parent or legal guardian to

8 appoint an educational decision maker for the child who has the knowledge and
9 skills to act in the best interests of the child in all matters relating to the education
10 of the child. Such a person may include, without limitation:
11 (a) A relative of the child within the fifth degree of consanguinity;

20 child in the plan for permanent placement adopted pursuant to NRS 432B.553.
21 5. The fact that a person other than the parent or guardian of a child is
22 appointed as an educational decision maker pursuant to this section must not be
23 used in any proceeding as evidence that the person is an unfit parent or unfit to be
24 the guardian of the child.
25 6. An educational decision maker appointed pursuant to this section shall not
26 be deemed to be an employee of a public agency involved in the education of the
27 child.

36 (a) At the commencement of the hearing, the court shall advise the parties of
37 their right to be represented by an attorney and of their right to present evidence.

42 (2) In the best interests of the child to place the child outside of his or her
43 home.
44  The court shall prepare an explicit statement of the facts upon which each of its

49 an affirmative finding regarding either subparagraph (1) or (2), the court shall issue

8 related within the fifth degree of consanguinity to the child who the court finds has

10 upon such conditions as the court prescribes, regardless of whether the relative
11 resides within this State; or
12 (b) Grant the grandparent, great-grandparent or other person related within the
13 fifth degree of consanguinity to the child a reasonable right to visit the child while
14 the child is in protective custody.

19 placement must be in accordance with NRS 127.330.

29 its order, after receipt and review of the report from the agency which provides
30 child welfare services:
31 (a) Permit the child to remain in the temporary or permanent custody of the
32 parents of the child or a guardian with or without supervision by the court or a
33 person or agency designated by the court, and with or without retaining jurisdiction
34 of the case, upon such conditions as the court may prescribe;
35 (b) [Place] Under the conditions prescribed by section 3 of this act, place the
36 child in the temporary or permanent custody of a relative, a fictive kin or other
37 person the court finds suitable to receive and care for the child with or without
38 supervision, and with or without retaining jurisdiction of the case, upon such
39 conditions as the court may prescribe; or
40 (c) Place the child in the temporary custody of a public agency or institution
41 authorized to care for children, the local juvenile probation department, the local

44 100,000 or more to care for such a child.
45  In carrying out this subsection, the court may, in its sole discretion and in
46 compliance with the requirements of chapter 159A of NRS, consider an application
47 for the guardianship of the child. If the court grants such an application, it may
48 retain jurisdiction of the case or transfer the case to another court of competent
49 jurisdiction.
50 2. The court shall not deny placement of a child in the temporary or
51 permanent custody of a person pursuant to subsection 1 solely because the person:
52 (a) Is deaf, is blind or has another physical disability; or

13 5. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, a copy of the report
14 prepared for the court by the agency which provides child welfare services must be
15 sent to the custodian and the parent or legal guardian. If the child was delivered to a
16 provider of emergency services pursuant to NRS 432B.630:
17 (a) The parent who delivered the child to the provider shall be deemed to have
18 waived his or her right to a copy of the report; and

23 (a) It must be presumed to be in the best interests of the child to be placed
24 together with the siblings of the child [.] , unless there is a credible allegation that

27 432B.390.
28 (b) Preference must be given to placing the child in the following order:
29 (1) With any person related within the fifth degree of consanguinity to the

32 within this State.
33 (2) In a foster home that is licensed pursuant to chapter 424 of NRS.
34 7. Any search for a relative with whom to place a child pursuant to this
35 section must be completed within [1 year] 6 months after the initial placement of
36 the child outside of the home of the child. If a child is placed with any person who
37 resides outside of this State, the placement must be in accordance with NRS
38 127.330.
39 8. Within 60 days after the removal of a child from the home of the child, the
40 court shall:
41 (a) Determine whether:
42 (1) The agency which provides child welfare services has made the
43 reasonable efforts required by paragraph (a) of subsection 1 of NRS 432B.393; or
44 (2) No such efforts are required in the particular case; and

7 court at a hearing conducted pursuant to NRS 432B.590; and
8 (b) Make reasonable efforts to finalize the permanent placement of the child in

11 efforts required by this paragraph.
12 2. If the child is not residing in the home of the child and has been in foster
13 care for [14] 15 or more of the immediately preceding [20] 22 months, the agency
14 shall include the termination of parental rights to the child in the plan for the
15 permanent placement of the child, unless the agency determines that:
16 (a) The child is in the care of a relative;
17 (b) The plan for the child requires the agency to make reasonable efforts
18 pursuant to NRS 432B.393 to reunify the family of the child, and the agency has

20 the child, such services as the agency deems necessary for the safe return of the
21 child to the home of the child; or

28 the placement must be reviewed by the court at least semiannually, and within 90
29 days after a request by a party to any of the prior proceedings. Unless the parent,

46 the services needed to assist the child in transitioning to independent living; and
47 (e) If the child has been placed outside of this State, whether the placement
48 outside of this State continues to be appropriate for and in the best interests of the
49 child.
50 5. The court shall prepare an explicit statement of the facts upon which each
51 of its determinations is based pursuant to subsection 4. If the court determines that
52 it is not in the best interests of the child to be returned to his or her parents, or to be
53 placed for adoption, with a legal guardian or with a relative, the court must include
Senate Amendment No. 217 to Senate Bill No. 187 Page 18
1 compelling reasons for this determination and an explanation of those reasons in its
2 statement of the facts.
3 6. If the court determines that it is in the best interests of the child to
4 terminate parental rights, the court shall use its best efforts to ensure that the
5 procedures required by chapter 128 of NRS are completed within 6 months after the
6 date the court makes that determination, including, without limitation, appointing a
7 private attorney to expedite the completion of the procedures.
8 7. The provisions of this section do not limit the jurisdiction of the court to
9 review any decisions of the agency with legal custody of the child regarding the
10 permanent placement of the child.
11 8. If a child has been placed outside of the home and has resided outside of
12 the home pursuant to that placement for [14] 15 months of any [20] 22 consecutive
13 months, the best interests of the child must be presumed to be served by the
14 termination of parental rights.
15 9. This hearing may take the place of the hearing for review required by NRS
16 432B.580.
17 10. If a hearing pursuant to this section concerns a child who has been placed
18 in a qualified residential treatment program, the hearing must include, without
19 limitation, a review of that placement conducted in the manner prescribed by NRS
20 432B.575.
21 11. The provision of notice and a right to be heard pursuant to this section
22 does not cause any person planning to adopt the child, any sibling of the child or
23 any other relative, any adoptive parent of a sibling of the child or a provider of
24 foster care to become a party to the hearing.] (Deleted by amendment.)
25 Sec. 16. [NRS 432B.5901 is hereby amended to read as follows:
26 432B.5901 1. The provisions of chapter 128 of NRS, to the extent they do
27 not conflict with the provisions of NRS 432B.5901 to 432B.5908, inclusive, apply
28 to all proceedings concerning the termination of parental rights that are commenced
29 pursuant to this section by an agency which provides child welfare services.
30 2. If a child is determined to be a child in need of protection pursuant to NRS
31 432B.550, an agency which provides child welfare services [may,] :
32 (a) May, at any stage of a proceeding held pursuant to this chapter, file a
33 motion for the termination of parental rights as part of the proceeding.
34 (b) Shall file a motion for the termination of parental rights if the child has
35 been placed outside of the home and has resided outside of the home pursuant to
36 that placement for 15 months of any 22 consecutive months, unless the agency
37 determines that:
38 (1) The child is in the care of a relative;
39 (2) The plan for the child requires the agency to make reasonable efforts
40 pursuant to NRS 432B.393 to reunify the family of the child, and the agency has
41 not provided to the family, consistently within the period specified in the plan for
42 the child, such services as the agency deems necessary for the safe return of the
43 child to the home of the child; or
44 (3) There are compelling reasons, which are documented in the plan for
45 the child, for concluding that the filing of a petition to terminate parental rights
46 to the child would not be in the best interests of the child.] (Deleted by
47 amendment.)
48 Sec. 17. [NRS 49.295 is hereby amended to read as follows:
49 49.295 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsections 2 and 3 and NRS
50 49.305:
51 (a) A married person cannot be examined as a witness for or against his or her
52 spouse without his or her consent.
Senate Amendment No. 217 to Senate Bill No. 187 Page 19
1 (b) No spouse can be examined, during the marriage or afterwards, without the
2 consent of the other spouse, as to any communication made by one to the other
3 during marriage.
4 2. The provisions of subsection 1 do not apply to a:
5 (a) Civil proceeding brought by or on behalf of one spouse against the other
6 spouse;
7 (b) Proceeding to commit or otherwise place a spouse, the property of the
8 spouse or both the spouse and the property of the spouse under the control of
9 another because of the alleged mental or physical condition of the spouse;
10 (c) Proceeding brought by or on behalf of a spouse to establish his or her
11 competence;
12 (d) Proceeding in the juvenile court or family court pursuant to title 5 of NRS
13 or NRS 432B.410 to 432B.590, inclusive [;] , and section 3 of this act; or
14 (e) Criminal proceeding in which one spouse is charged with:
15 (1) A crime against the person or the property of the other spouse or of a
16 child of either, or of a child in the custody or control of either, whether the crime
17 was committed before or during marriage.
18 (2) Bigamy or incest.
19 (3) A crime related to abandonment of a child or nonsupport of the other
20 spouse or child.
21 3. The provisions of subsection 1 do not apply in any criminal proceeding to
22 events which took place before the spouses were married.] (Deleted by
23 amendment.)
24 Sec. 18. [NRS 128.109 is hereby amended to read as follows:
25 128.109 1. If a child has been placed outside of his or her home pursuant to
26 chapter 432B of NRS, the following provisions must be applied to determine the
27 conduct of the parent:
28 (a) If the child has resided outside of his or her home pursuant to that
29 placement for [14] 15 months of any [20] 22 consecutive months, it must be
30 presumed that the parent or parents have demonstrated only token efforts to care for
31 the child as set forth in subparagraph (6) of paragraph (b) of subsection 1 of NRS
32 128.105.
33 (b) If the parent or parents fail to comply substantially with the terms and
34 conditions of a plan to reunite the family within 6 months after the date on which
35 the child was placed or the plan was commenced, whichever occurs later, that
36 failure to comply is evidence of failure of parental adjustment as set forth in
37 subparagraph (4) of paragraph (b) of subsection 1 of NRS 128.105.
38 2. If a child has been placed outside of his or her home pursuant to chapter
39 432B of NRS and has resided outside of his or her home pursuant to that placement
40 for [14] 15 months of any [20] 22 consecutive months, the best interests of the child
41 must be presumed to be served by the termination of parental rights.
42 3. The presumptions specified in subsections 1 and 2 must not be overcome or
43 otherwise affected by evidence of failure of the State to provide services to the
44 family.] (Deleted by amendment.)

FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.

~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to child welfare; prescribing a time period within which an
agency which provides child welfare services is required to take certain
action relating to medical or mental health treatment for a child in the
custody of the agency; [revising requirements concerning the
placement of such a child; clarifying that a court may revoke the
appointment of a fictive kin as an educational decision maker under
certain circumstances; requiring a court that is reviewing the placement
of a child with a fictive kin to consider certain factors; revising the
requirement for an agency which provides child welfare services to
take certain actions to terminate the parental rights of the parents of a
child under certain circumstances; revising certain presumptions
relating to the termination of parental rights;] and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes an agent or officer of a law enforcement agency, an officer of the
2 local juvenile probation department or the local department of juvenile services, or a designee
3 of an agency which provides child welfare services to place a child in protective custody: (1)
4 with the consent of the parent or legal guardian of the child; or (2) under certain circumstances
5 indicating that the child is in need of protection from injury, abuse or neglect. (NRS
6 432B.390) Under existing law, within 72 hours after the placement of a child in protective
7 custody, a court is required to hold a hearing to determine whether the child should remain in
8 protective custody and, if so, where the child will be temporarily placed. (NRS 432B.470,
9 432B.480) If the court orders that the child remain in protective custody, existing law requires
10 the agency which provides child welfare services to file a petition alleging that the child is in
11 need of protection, unless good cause exists not to file such a petition. (NRS 432B.490)
12 Within 30 days after the filing of such a petition, existing law requires the court to hold a
13 hearing to determine the custody and placement of the child. (NRS 432B.530, 432B.550)
14 Existing law requires the court to review such a placement at least semiannually and within 90
15 days after a request by a party to any of the prior proceedings. (NRS 432B.580)
16 Section 2 of this bill requires an agency which provides child welfare services to provide
17 or deny consent to medical or mental health treatment for a child who is in the custody of the
18 agency within 14 days after such consent is requested. If the consent of any other person or
19 entity or a court order is required before such a child may receive medical or mental health
20 treatment, section 2 requires the agency which provides child welfare services to: (1) make

Senate Amendment No. 217 to Senate Bill No. 187 Page 4
21 reasonable efforts to [obtain] initiate such consent or a court order within 14 days after the
22 agency which provides child welfare services becomes aware of the need for treatment; and
23 (2) notify the person or entity with whom the child is placed within [1] 3 business [day] days
24 after obtaining the consent or order or the denial of the consent or order, as applicable.
25 [Existing law authorizes a court to: (1) temporarily place a child who is in protective
26 custody with certain relatives, pending a hearing on a petition alleging that the child is in need
27 of protection; and (2) place a child with a relative or fictive kin at such a hearing. (NRS
28 432B.480, 432B.550) Sections 3, 11, 12 and 14 of this bill authorize a court to place a child
29 with a relative or fictive kin or continue such a placement only if the court determines that the
30 placement is in the best interests of the child after considering certain factors relating to the
31 ability of the relative or fictive kin to meet the needs of the child. Sections 4, 5, 8-10 and 17 of
32 this bill make conforming changes to indicate the applicability of certain provisions that apply
33 generally to child welfare proceedings generally to section 3. Section 12 revises, from 1 year
34 after the initial placement of a child who has been adjudicated to be in need of protection
35 outside the home to 6 months after such placement, the authorized length of time for a search
36 for a relative with whom to place the child.
37 Existing law requires an agency which provides child welfare services, any other person
38 or entity that places a child in protective custody, or a court, to place a child who is in
39 protective custody or has been adjudicated to be in need of protection together with siblings
40 whenever possible. (NRS 432B.390, 432B.3905, 432B.550) Sections 6, 7 and 12 of this bill
41 provide that this requirement does not apply where the child has abused or has been abused by
42 a sibling.
43 Existing law defines “fictive kin” to mean a person who is not related by blood to a child
44 but who has a significant emotional and positive relationship with the child. (NRS 432B.0657)
45 Section 9 clarifies that a court is authorized to revoke the appointment of a fictive kin as an
46 educational decision maker if the person no longer has a significant emotional and positive
47 relationship with the child. Section 14 requires a court that is reviewing the placement of a
48 child with a fictive kin to determine whether the person continues to have a significant
49 emotional and positive relationship with the child.
50 Existing federal law establishes certain programs to provide grants of money to states for
51 certain purposes related to foster care, adoption assistance and other child welfare programs.
52 (42 U.S.C. §§ 621 et seq.; 42 U.S.C. §§ 670 et seq.) To be eligible for such grants, existing
53 federal law requires a state to have a plan for the provision of child welfare services that
54 satisfies certain requirements, including, without limitation, the development of a case plan
55 for each child receiving assistance under the plan and a “case review system” with respect to
56 such a child. (42 U.S.C. § 622(b)(8)(A)(ii); 42 U.S.C. § 671(a)(16); 42 U.S.C. § 675(5))
57 Under existing federal law, the “case review system” set forth in a state plan is required to
58 include, without limitation, a requirement that the State file a petition to terminate the parental
59 rights of the parents of a child if the child has been in foster care under the responsibility of
60 the State for 15 of the most recent 22 months, unless certain exceptions apply. (42 U.S.C. §
61 675(5)(E)) Section 16 of this bill requires an agency which provides child welfare services to
62 file such a petition within that time period. Sections 13, 15 and 18 of this bill accordingly
63 revise certain provisions related to the termination of parental rights to apply where a child
64 has been placed outside of the home and resided outside of the home pursuant to that
65 placement for 15 months of any 22 consecutive months, rather than for 14 of any 20
66 consecutive months.]

13 3. If an order of the court is required before a child who is in the custody of
14 an agency which provides child welfare services may receive medical or mental
15 health treatment, the agency which provides child welfare services shall:

18 the need for the treatment; and
19 (b) Notify the person or entity with whom the child is placed within [1] 3
20 business [day] days after obtaining such an order or the denial of a request for

8 the court determines the revocation of the appointment is in the best interests of the
9 child. A court may determine that the revocation of the appointment of a fictive

2 (a) The parent retains the right to consent to adoption, to determine the child’s
3 religious affiliation and to reasonable visitation, unless restricted by the court. If the
4 custodian of the child interferes with these rights, the parent may petition the court
5 for enforcement of the rights of the parent.
6 (b) The court shall set forth good cause why the child was placed other than
7 with a parent.
8 4. If, pursuant to subsection 1, the child is to be placed with a relative or
9 fictive kin, the court may consider, among other factors [,] and in addition to the
10 factors prescribed by section 3 of this act, whether the child has resided with a
11 particular relative or fictive kin for 3 years or more before the incident which
12 brought the child to the court’s attention.
13 5. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, a copy of the report
14 prepared for the court by the agency which provides child welfare services must be
15 sent to the custodian and the parent or legal guardian. If the child was delivered to a
16 provider of emergency services pursuant to NRS 432B.630:
17 (a) The parent who delivered the child to the provider shall be deemed to have
18 waived his or her right to a copy of the report; and
19 (b) A copy of the report must be sent to the parent who did not deliver the child
20 to the provider, if the location of such parent is known.
21 6. In determining the placement of a child pursuant to this section, if the child
22 is not permitted to remain in the custody of the parents of the child or guardian:
23 (a) It must be presumed to be in the best interests of the child to be placed
24 together with the siblings of the child [.] , unless there is a credible allegation that
25 the child has abused or has been abused by a sibling of the child. As used in this
26 paragraph, “abuse” has the meaning ascribed to it in subsection 7 of NRS
27 432B.390.
28 (b) Preference must be given to placing the child in the following order:
29 (1) With any person related within the fifth degree of consanguinity to the
30 child or a fictive kin, and who is suitable and able to provide proper care and
31 guidance for the child, regardless of whether the relative or fictive kin resides
32 within this State.
33 (2) In a foster home that is licensed pursuant to chapter 424 of NRS.
34 7. Any search for a relative with whom to place a child pursuant to this
35 section must be completed within [1 year] 6 months after the initial placement of
36 the child outside of the home of the child. If a child is placed with any person who
37 resides outside of this State, the placement must be in accordance with NRS
38 127.330.
39 8. Within 60 days after the removal of a child from the home of the child, the
40 court shall:
41 (a) Determine whether:
42 (1) The agency which provides child welfare services has made the
43 reasonable efforts required by paragraph (a) of subsection 1 of NRS 432B.393; or
44 (2) No such efforts are required in the particular case; and
45 (b) Prepare an explicit statement of the facts upon which its determination is
46 based.
47 9. As used in this section:
48 (a) “Blind” has the meaning ascribed to it in NRS 426.082.
49 (b) “Holder of a valid registry identification card” means a person who holds a
50 valid registry identification card as defined in NRS 678C.080 that identifies the
51 person as:
52 (1) Exempt from state prosecution for engaging in the medical use of
53 cannabis; or

7 court at a hearing conducted pursuant to NRS 432B.590; and
8 (b) Make reasonable efforts to finalize the permanent placement of the child in

15 permanent placement of the child, unless the agency determines that:
16 (a) The child is in the care of a relative;
17 (b) The plan for the child requires the agency to make reasonable efforts
18 pursuant to NRS 432B.393 to reunify the family of the child, and the agency has
19 not provided to the family, consistently within the period specified in the plan for
20 the child, such services as the agency deems necessary for the safe return of the
21 child to the home of the child; or

26 doing so, the court must determine, based on a preponderance of the evidence:
27 (a) Whether the agency with legal custody of the child has made the reasonable
28 efforts required by subsection 1 of NRS 432B.553;

43 agency with legal custody of the child fully considered placement options both
44 within and outside of this State;
45 (d) If the child has attained the age of 14 years, whether the child will receive
46 the services needed to assist the child in transitioning to independent living; and
47 (e) If the child has been placed outside of this State, whether the placement

51 of its determinations is based pursuant to subsection 4. If the court determines that

6 date the court makes that determination, including, without limitation, appointing a
7 private attorney to expedite the completion of the procedures.

10 permanent placement of the child.
11 8. If a child has been placed outside of the home and has resided outside of
12 the home pursuant to that placement for [14] 15 months of any [20] 22 consecutive
13 months, the best interests of the child must be presumed to be served by the
14 termination of parental rights.
15 9. This hearing may take the place of the hearing for review required by NRS
16 432B.580.
17 10. If a hearing pursuant to this section concerns a child who has been placed
18 in a qualified residential treatment program, the hearing must include, without
19 limitation, a review of that placement conducted in the manner prescribed by NRS
20 432B.575.
21 11. The provision of notice and a right to be heard pursuant to this section

33 motion for the termination of parental rights as part of the proceeding.
34 (b) Shall file a motion for the termination of parental rights if the child has

40 pursuant to NRS 432B.393 to reunify the family of the child, and the agency has
41 not provided to the family, consistently within the period specified in the plan for
42 the child, such services as the agency deems necessary for the safe return of the
43 child to the home of the child; or
44 (3) There are compelling reasons, which are documented in the plan for

27 conduct of the parent:
28 (a) If the child has resided outside of his or her home pursuant to that
29 placement for [14] 15 months of any [20] 22 consecutive months, it must be
30 presumed that the parent or parents have demonstrated only token efforts to care for
31 the child as set forth in subparagraph (6) of paragraph (b) of subsection 1 of NRS
32 128.105.
33 (b) If the parent or parents fail to comply substantially with the terms and
34 conditions of a plan to reunite the family within 6 months after the date on which
35 the child was placed or the plan was commenced, whichever occurs later, that
36 failure to comply is evidence of failure of parental adjustment as set forth in
