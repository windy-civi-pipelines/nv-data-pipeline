Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates in the State Treasury the Fund to Assist School Districts in
2 Financing Capital Improvements and requires that the money in the Fund be used to
3 provide grants to school districts within which certain emergency conditions exist.
4 (NRS 387.333, 387.3335) Existing law additionally creates in the State Treasury
5 the Fund to Assist Rural School Districts in Financing Capital Improvements and
6 requires that the money in the Fund be awarded by the Director of the Office of
7 Finance in the Office of the Governor as grants to school districts in counties whose
8 population is less than 100,000 (currently all counties other than Clark and Washoe
9 Counties) and in which certain taxes have been levied for capital projects of the
10 school district. (NRS 387.3341-387.3344) Sections 1 and 2 of this bill provide that
11 any money remaining in those Funds at the end of a fiscal year does not revert to
12 the State General Fund and requires that the balances in those Funds be carried
13 forward to the next fiscal year.

15 make a grant from the Fund to Assist Rural School Districts in Financing Capital
16 Improvements to a board of trustees of a school district in a county whose
17 population is less than 100,000, regardless of whether certain taxes for capital
18 projects of the school district have been levied in that county, in an amount that is
