Assembly Bill No. 355–Committee on Ways and Means
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to education; providing that any money remaining
in the Fund to Assist School Districts in Financing Capital
Improvements and the Fund to Assist Rural School Districts
in Financing Capital Improvements at the end of the fiscal
year does not revert to the State General Fund; revising
provisions relating to grants from the Fund to Assist Rural
School Districts in Financing Capital Improvements; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law creates in the State Treasury the Fund to Assist School Districts in
Financing Capital Improvements and requires that the money in the Fund be used to
provide grants to school districts within which certain emergency conditions exist.
(NRS 387.333, 387.3335) Existing law additionally creates in the State Treasury
the Fund to Assist Rural School Districts in Financing Capital Improvements and
requires that the money in the Fund be awarded by the Director of the Office of
Finance in the Office of the Governor as grants to school districts in counties whose
population is less than 100,000 (currently all counties other than Clark and Washoe
Counties) and in which certain taxes have been levied for capital projects of the
school district. (NRS 387.3341-387.3344) Sections 1 and 2 of this bill provide that
any money remaining in those Funds at the end of a fiscal year does not revert to
the State General Fund and requires that the balances in those Funds be carried
forward to the next fiscal year.
Section 2.5 of this bill authorizes the Director of the Office of Finance to also
make a grant from the Fund to Assist Rural School Districts in Financing Capital
Improvements to a board of trustees of a school district in a county whose
population is less than 100,000, regardless of whether certain taxes for capital
projects of the school district have been levied in that county, in an amount that is
equal to: (1) any gift, grant or donation made to the school district for a capital
project of the school district located on certain tribal land; or (2) any interest
accrued on money received by a school district for a capital project of the school
district located on certain tribal land.
