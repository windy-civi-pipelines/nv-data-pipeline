AN ACT relating to public health; requiring the Department of
Health and Human Services to publish certain information
relating to breastfeeding and develop a program of public
education concerning lactation; authorizing certain
providers of health care and medical facilities to provide
that information to certain persons; prohibiting a place of
public accommodation from engaging in certain
discrimination against a person who is breastfeeding;
authorizing certain civil actions and administrative actions
to enforce that prohibition; providing a penalty; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Medicaid program to cover: (1) counseling and
2 support for breastfeeding; (2) supplies for breastfeeding until the child’s first
3 birthday; and (3) lactation consultation and support. (NRS 422.27174, 422.27179)
4 Existing law authorizes Medicaid to provide additional coverage of supplies for
5 breastfeeding. (NRS 422.27178) Section 1 of this bill requires the Department of
6 Health and Human Services to post on an Internet website maintained by the
-
*AB266*

– 2 –
7 Department: (1) a fact sheet that provides information concerning that coverage
8 under Medicaid; and (2) a list of services available in the community for lactation
9 support. Section 1 authorizes certain providers of health care and medical facilities
10 that provide care to a pregnant person to provide the information posted by the
11 Department to the pregnant person and, with the consent or at the direction of the
12 pregnant person, certain other persons. Section 1 additionally requires
13 the Department to develop and carry out a program of public education to increase
14 public awareness about lactation.
15 Existing law provides that all persons are entitled to the full and equal
16 enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages and
17 accommodations of any place of public accommodation, without discrimination or
18 segregation on the ground of race, color, religion, national origin, disability, sexual
19 orientation, sex or gender identity or expression. (NRS 651.070) Existing law
20 defines the term “place of public accommodation” to mean any establishment or
21 place to which the public is invited or which is intended for public use, including,
22 inns, hotels, motels, restaurants, bars, gasoline stations, theaters, convention
23 centers, bakeries, grocery stores, laundromats, museums, libraries, parks, zoos,
24 nurseries, private and public schools or universities, day care centers, senior citizen
25 centers, gymnasiums, health spas and bowling alleys. (NRS 651.050; Clark County
26 Sch. Dist. v. Buchanan, 112 Nev. 1146 (1996)) Section 4 of this bill prohibits a
27 place of public accommodation from: (1) denying the full and equal enjoyment of
28 the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages and accommodations of any
29 place of public accommodation to a person because the person is breastfeeding a
30 child; or (2) publishing a statement, advertisement, notice or sign that conflicts with
31 that prohibition. Section 5 of this bill makes the definition of “place of public
32 accommodation” in existing law apply to section 4. Section 6 of this bill clarifies
33 that those prohibitions do not apply to certain private establishments that are not
34 places of public accommodation. Section 7 of this bill makes certain actions that
35 violate section 4 misdemeanors, and section 8 of this bill authorizes a victim of
36 such a violation to file a civil action. Section 9 of this bill authorizes a county or
37 incorporated city to adopt an ordinance that protects the rights protected by section
38 4, with certain limitations. Section 10 of this bill authorizes a victim of a violation
39 of section 4 to file a complaint with the Nevada Equal Rights Commission, and
40 section 3 of this bill authorizes the Commission to order its Administrator to
41 investigate and hold hearings on such a complaint. The Commission would also be
42 authorized to: (1) hold an informal meeting to attempt to settle a dispute over an
43 alleged violation of section 4; and (2) after a formal public hearing, order the place
44 of public accommodation to cease and desist from activity that violates section 4
45 and take corrective action. (NRS 233.170) Section 2 of this bill makes a
46 conforming change to include preventing discrimination against persons who are
47 breastfeeding children within the purposes of the Commission.
