AN ACT relating to public health; requiring the Department of Health and Human
Services to publish certain information relating to breastfeeding and
develop a program of public education concerning lactation;
authorizing certain providers of health care and medical facilities to
provide that information to certain persons; prohibiting a place of
public accommodation from engaging in certain discrimination against
a person who is breastfeeding; authorizing certain civil actions and
administrative actions to enforce that prohibition; providing a penalty;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Medicaid program to cover: (1) counseling and support for
2 breastfeeding; (2) supplies for breastfeeding until the child’s first birthday; and (3) lactation
3 consultation and support. (NRS 422.27174, 422.27179) Existing law authorizes Medicaid to
4 provide additional coverage of supplies for breastfeeding. (NRS 422.27178) Section 1 of this
5 bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services to post on an Internet website
6 maintained by the Department: (1) a fact sheet that provides information concerning that
7 coverage under Medicaid; and (2) a list of services available in the community for lactation
8 support. Section 1 authorizes certain providers of health care and medical facilities that
9 provide care to a pregnant person to provide the information posted by the Department to the
10 pregnant person and, with the consent or at the direction of the pregnant person, certain other
11 persons. Section 1 additionally requires the Department to develop and carry out a program of
12 public education to increase public awareness about lactation.
13 Existing law provides that all persons are entitled to the full and equal enjoyment of the
14 goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages and accommodations of any place of public
15 accommodation, without discrimination or segregation on the ground of race, color, religion,

Assembly Amendment No. 91 to Assembly Bill No. 266 Page 4
16 national origin, disability, sexual orientation, sex or gender identity or expression. (NRS
17 651.070) Existing law defines the term “place of public accommodation” to mean any
18 establishment or place to which the public is invited or which is intended for public use,
19 including inns, hotels, motels, restaurants, bars, gasoline stations, theaters, convention centers,
20 bakeries, grocery stores, laundromats, museums, libraries, parks, zoos, nurseries, private and
21 public schools or universities, day care centers, senior citizen centers, gymnasiums, health
22 spas and bowling alleys. (NRS 651.050; Clark County Sch. Dist. v. Buchanan, 112 Nev. 1146
23 (1996)) Section 4 of this bill prohibits a place of public accommodation , except if required
24 by law, regulation or ordinance to restrict the access of a minor to the place of public
25 accommodation, from: (1) denying the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services,
26 facilities, privileges, advantages and accommodations of any place of public accommodation
27 to a person because the person is breastfeeding a child; or (2) publishing a statement,
28 advertisement, notice or sign that conflicts with that prohibition. Section 5 of this bill makes
29 the definition of “place of public accommodation” in existing law apply to section 4. Section
30 6 of this bill clarifies that those prohibitions do not apply to certain private establishments that
31 are not places of public accommodation. Section 7 of this bill makes certain actions that
32 violate section 4 misdemeanors, and section 8 of this bill authorizes a victim of such a
33 violation to file a civil action. Section 9 of this bill authorizes a county or incorporated city to
34 adopt an ordinance that protects the rights protected by section 4, with certain limitations.
35 Section 10 of this bill authorizes a victim of a violation of section 4 to file a complaint with
36 the Nevada Equal Rights Commission, and section 3 of this bill authorizes the Commission to
37 order its Administrator to investigate and hold hearings on such a complaint. The Commission
38 would also be authorized to: (1) hold an informal meeting to attempt to settle a dispute over an
39 alleged violation of section 4; and (2) after a formal public hearing, order the place of public
40 accommodation to cease and desist from activity that violates section 4 and take corrective
41 action. (NRS 233.170) Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to include preventing
42 discrimination against persons who are breastfeeding children within the purposes of the
43 Commission. Section 1.5 of this bill provides that it is not an unlawful discriminatory
44 practice in public accommodations to enforce a law, regulation or ordinance restricting
45 a minor from entering or remaining in the place of public accommodation.
