EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public health; requiring the Department of
Health and Human Services to publish certain information
relating to breastfeeding and develop a program of public
education concerning lactation; authorizing certain
providers of health care and medical facilities to provide
that information to certain persons; prohibiting a place of
public accommodation from engaging in certain
discrimination against a person who is breastfeeding;
authorizing certain civil actions and administrative actions
to enforce that prohibition; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Medicaid program to cover: (1) counseling and
2 support for breastfeeding; (2) supplies for breastfeeding until the child’s first
3 birthday; and (3) lactation consultation and support. (NRS 422.27174, 422.27179)
4 Existing law authorizes Medicaid to provide additional coverage of supplies for
5 breastfeeding. (NRS 422.27178) Section 1 of this bill requires the Department of
6 Health and Human Services to post on an Internet website maintained by the
-
*AB266_R1*

– 2 –
7 Department: (1) a fact sheet that provides information concerning that coverage
8 under Medicaid; and (2) a list of services available in the community for lactation
9 support. Section 1 authorizes certain providers of health care and medical facilities
10 that provide care to a pregnant person to provide the information posted by the
11 Department to the pregnant person and, with the consent or at the direction of the
12 pregnant person, certain other persons. Section 1 additionally requires
13 the Department to develop and carry out a program of public education to increase
14 public awareness about lactation.
15 Existing law provides that all persons are entitled to the full and equal
16 enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages and
17 accommodations of any place of public accommodation, without discrimination or
18 segregation on the ground of race, color, religion, national origin, disability, sexual
19 orientation, sex or gender identity or expression. (NRS 651.070) Existing law
20 defines the term “place of public accommodation” to mean any establishment or
21 place to which the public is invited or which is intended for public use, including
22 inns, hotels, motels, restaurants, bars, gasoline stations, theaters, convention
23 centers, bakeries, grocery stores, laundromats, museums, libraries, parks, zoos,
24 nurseries, private and public schools or universities, day care centers, senior citizen
25 centers, gymnasiums, health spas and bowling alleys. (NRS 651.050; Clark County
26 Sch. Dist. v. Buchanan, 112 Nev. 1146 (1996)) Section 4 of this bill prohibits a
27 place of public accommodation, except if required by law, regulation or ordinance
28 to restrict the access of a minor to the place of public accommodation, from: (1)
29 denying the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges,
30 advantages and accommodations of any place of public accommodation to a person
31 because the person is breastfeeding a child; or (2) publishing a statement,
32 advertisement, notice or sign that conflicts with that prohibition. Section 5 of this
33 bill makes the definition of “place of public accommodation” in existing law apply
34 to section 4. Section 6 of this bill clarifies that those prohibitions do not apply to
35 certain private establishments that are not places of public accommodation. Section
36 8 of this bill authorizes a victim of certain violations of section 4 to file a civil
37 action. Section 9 of this bill authorizes a county or incorporated city to adopt an
38 ordinance that protects the rights protected by section 4, with certain limitations.
39 Section 10 of this bill authorizes a victim of a violation of section 4 to file a
40 complaint with the Nevada Equal Rights Commission, and section 3 of this bill
41 authorizes the Commission to order its Administrator to investigate and hold
42 hearings on such a complaint. The Commission would also be authorized to: (1)
43 hold an informal meeting to attempt to settle a dispute over an alleged violation of
44 section 4; and (2) after a formal public hearing, order the place of public
45 accommodation to cease and desist from activity that violates section 4 and take
46 corrective action. (NRS 233.170) Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change
47 to include preventing discrimination against persons who are breastfeeding children
48 within the purposes of the Commission. Section 1.5 of this bill provides that it is
49 not an unlawful discriminatory practice in public accommodations to enforce a law,
50 regulation or ordinance restricting a minor from entering or remaining in the place
51 of public accommodation.
