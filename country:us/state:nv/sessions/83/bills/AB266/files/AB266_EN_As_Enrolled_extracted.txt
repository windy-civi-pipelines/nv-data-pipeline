CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to public health; requiring the Department of
Health and Human Services to publish certain information
relating to breastfeeding and develop a program of public
education concerning lactation; authorizing certain providers
of health care and medical facilities to provide that
information to certain persons; prohibiting a place of public
accommodation from engaging in certain discrimination
against a person who is breastfeeding; authorizing certain
civil actions and administrative actions to enforce that
prohibition; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law requires the Medicaid program to cover: (1) counseling and
support for breastfeeding; (2) supplies for breastfeeding until the child’s first
birthday; and (3) lactation consultation and support. (NRS 422.27174, 422.27179)
Existing law authorizes Medicaid to provide additional coverage of supplies for
breastfeeding. (NRS 422.27178) Section 1 of this bill requires the Department of
Health and Human Services to post on an Internet website maintained by the
Department: (1) a fact sheet that provides information concerning that coverage
under Medicaid; and (2) a list of services available in the community for lactation
support. Section 1 authorizes certain providers of health care and medical facilities
that provide care to a pregnant person to provide the information posted by the
Department to the pregnant person and, with the consent or at the direction of the
pregnant person, certain other persons. Section 1 additionally requires
the Department to develop and carry out a program of public education to increase
public awareness about lactation.
Existing law provides that all persons are entitled to the full and equal
enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages and
accommodations of any place of public accommodation, without discrimination or
segregation on the ground of race, color, religion, national origin, disability, sexual
orientation, sex or gender identity or expression. (NRS 651.070) Existing law
defines the term “place of public accommodation” to mean any establishment or
place to which the public is invited or which is intended for public use, including
inns, hotels, motels, restaurants, bars, gasoline stations, theaters, convention
centers, bakeries, grocery stores, laundromats, museums, libraries, parks, zoos,
nurseries, private and public schools or universities, day care centers, senior citizen
centers, gymnasiums, health spas and bowling alleys. (NRS 651.050; Clark County
Sch. Dist. v. Buchanan, 112 Nev. 1146 (1996)) Section 4 of this bill prohibits a
place of public accommodation, except if required by law, regulation or ordinance
to restrict the access of a minor to the place of public accommodation, from: (1)
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 2 –
denying the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges,
advantages and accommodations of any place of public accommodation to a person
because the person is breastfeeding a child; or (2) publishing a statement,
advertisement, notice or sign that conflicts with that prohibition. Section 5 of this
bill makes the definition of “place of public accommodation” in existing law apply
to section 4. Section 6 of this bill clarifies that those prohibitions do not apply to
certain private establishments that are not places of public accommodation. Section
8 of this bill authorizes a victim of certain violations of section 4 to file a civil
action. Section 9 of this bill authorizes a county or incorporated city to adopt an
ordinance that protects the rights protected by section 4, with certain limitations.

Section 2:
Section 10 of this bill authorizes a victim of a violation of section 4 to file a
complaint with the Nevada Equal Rights Commission, and section 3 of this bill
authorizes the Commission to order its Administrator to investigate and hold
hearings on such a complaint. The Commission would also be authorized to: (1)
hold an informal meeting to attempt to settle a dispute over an alleged violation of

Section 3:
section 4; and (2) after a formal public hearing, order the place of public
accommodation to cease and desist from activity that violates section 4 and take
corrective action. (NRS 233.170) Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change
to include preventing discrimination against persons who are breastfeeding children
within the purposes of the Commission. Section 1.5 of this bill provides that it is
not an unlawful discriminatory practice in public accommodations to enforce a law,
regulation or ordinance restricting a minor from entering or remaining in the place
of public accommodation.
