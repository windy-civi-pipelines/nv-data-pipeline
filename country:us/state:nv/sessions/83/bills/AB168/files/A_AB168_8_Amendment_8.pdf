AN ACT relating to public safety; revising provisions governing the operation of a
bicycle [, an electric bicycle or an electric scooter] on a roadway;
providing a civil penalty; and providing other matters properly relating

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law grants certain rights to a person operating a bicycle [, an electric bicycle or
2 an electric scooter] upon a roadway and subjects any such person to certain duties and
3 responsibilities while operating the bicycle [, electric bicycle or electric scooter] on a
4 roadway. (NRS 484B.760-484B.785) Section 1 of this bill: (1) requires a person operating a
5 bicycle [, an electric bicycle or an electric scooter] to stop in obedience to a stop sign or signal
6 displaying a steady red light; and (2) creates an exception to the requirement to stop in
7 obedience to a stop sign if the person can safely proceed through the intersection without
8 stopping and certain other requirements are met. Section 1 also authorizes a person operating
9 a bicycle [, an electric bicycle or an electric scooter] to proceed cautiously through an
10 intersection where the signal is a steady red signal or make certain turns if the person stops
11 before entering the intersection and certain other requirements are met. Section 2 of this bill
12 provides that a violation of the provisions of section 1 is a civil infraction. Section 3 of this
13 bill makes a [confirming] conforming change to indicate the applicability of the requirements
14 prescribed by section 1.
