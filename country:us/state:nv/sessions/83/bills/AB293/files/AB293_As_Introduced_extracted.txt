20 guarantor for the debts of a company, corporation or association.
21 (c) In Lawrence v. Clark County, 127 Nev. 390, 405 (2011), the
22 Nevada Supreme Court held that the State does not donate, loan or
23 “gift” its money in violation of Section 9 of Article 8 of the Nevada

25 purposes and the State receives a valuable benefit or fair
26 consideration in exchange for the dispensation of the state funds.

28 Vegas, 68 Nev. 84, 93 (1951), and Lawrence v. Clark County, 127
29 Nev. 390, 399 (2011), the Nevada Supreme Court held that when
30 the Legislature authorizes a state agency to dispense state funds:
31 (1) The courts will carefully examine whether the Legislature
32 made an informed and appropriate finding that dispensation of the
33 state funds serves a public purposes and the State receives a
34 valuable benefit or fair consideration in exchange for the
35 dispensation;
36 (2) The courts will give great weight and due deference to
37 the Legislature’s finding, and the courts will uphold the
38 Legislature’s finding unless it clearly appears to be erroneous and
39 without reasonable foundations; and
40 (3) The courts will closely examine whether the dispensing
41 state agency reviews all facts, figures and necessary information
42 when making the dispensation, and when the state agency has done

9 (c) The provisions of section 9 of this act are intended to serve
10 an important public purpose and ensure that the State receives

18 small hub airports and nonhub airports enables the citizens and
19 businesses of this State to travel more efficiently, and at lower cost,
20 to and from the rural communities in this State; and
21 (3) The dispensing state agency may not make a grant of
22 money from the program unless the agency receives a commitment
23 from the air carrier receiving the grant to commence or continue air
24 service to a designated small hub airport, nonhub airport or large
25 hub airport that services small hub airports and nonhub airports.
26 Sec. 14. The Legislative Counsel shall, in preparing

33 officer or an agency whose name has been changed or whose

37 of the regulations has been transferred.
38 2. Any contracts or other agreements entered into by an officer
39 or agency whose name has been changed or whose responsibilities

28 Vegas, 68 Nev. 84, 93 (1951), and Lawrence v. Clark County, 127

32 made an informed and appropriate finding that dispensation of the
33 state funds serves a public purposes and the State receives a
34 valuable benefit or fair consideration in exchange for the
35 dispensation;

38 Legislature’s finding unless it clearly appears to be erroneous and

18 small hub airports and nonhub airports enables the citizens and
19 businesses of this State to travel more efficiently, and at lower cost,
20 to and from the rural communities in this State; and

22 money from the program unless the agency receives a commitment

25 hub airport that services small hub airports and nonhub airports.
