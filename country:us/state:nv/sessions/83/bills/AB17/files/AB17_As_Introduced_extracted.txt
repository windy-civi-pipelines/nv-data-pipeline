8 property possessed is not by law exempt from execution. If the
9 named garnishee is the State of Nevada, the writ of garnishment
10 must be served upon the [State Controller.] Division of Human
11 Resource Management of the Department of Administration.
12 3. The affidavit by or on behalf of the plaintiff may be
