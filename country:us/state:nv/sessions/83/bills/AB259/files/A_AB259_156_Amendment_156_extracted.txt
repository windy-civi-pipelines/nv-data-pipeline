AN ACT relating to health care; prohibiting certain actions related to pricing and
reimbursement for certain drugs; creating a cause of action for
violating such prohibitions; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing federal law establishes the Medicare program, which is a public health insurance
2 program for persons 65 years of age and older and specified persons with disabilities who are
3 under 65 years of age. (42 U.S.C. §§ 1395 et seq.) Existing federal law requires the United
4 States Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate with the manufacturers of certain
5 drugs and to establish the maximum fair price for certain drugs, which is the maximum price
6 at which such drugs may be sold to a recipient of Medicare. (42 U.S.C. §§ 1320f-2, 1320f-3)
7 Existing federal law requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to publish those
8 maximum fair prices. (42 U.S.C. § 1320f-4) Section 1 of this bill prohibits a person or entity
9 that: (1) purchases a drug which is subject to a maximum fair price in this State from paying a
10 price that is higher than the maximum fair price; or (2) seeks reimbursement for a drug subject
11 to a maximum fair price which is delivered, dispensed or administered to a person in this State
12 from seeking reimbursement at a rate which is higher than the maximum fair price. Section 1
13 exempts from such prohibitions certain providers of health coverage under federal law
14 but prescribes a procedure by which such a provider of health coverage may elect to be
15 subject to the provisions of section 1.
16 Existing law: (1) prohibits certain trade practices which are deemed to be deceptive trade
17 practices; and (2) provides for the enforcement of the prohibition on engaging in deceptive
18 trade practices, including by prescribing criminal penalties to be imposed against a person
19 who engages in a deceptive trade practice. (NRS 598.0903-598.0999) Section 1 makes it a
20 deceptive trade practice for any person to violate the prohibition on purchasing or seeking
21 reimbursement for a drug at a price higher than the maximum fair price. Sections 1 and 3 of
22 this bill provide that a person who violates the provisions of section 1 is not subject to any
23 criminal penalty set forth in existing law for engaging in a deceptive trade practice, meaning
24 such a person is subject only to the various civil enforcement measures, including civil
25 penalties, set forth in existing law for engaging in a deceptive trade practice. (NRS 598.097-
26 598.0999)
27 Existing law authorizes any person who is a victim of consumer fraud, including a
28 deceptive trade practice, to bring a civil action. (NRS 41.600) Section 2 of this bill provides
29 that a violation of section 1 constitutes consumer fraud, and sections 1 and 2 authorize a
30 victim of such a violation to bring a civil action.
Assembly Amendment No. 156 to Assembly Bill No. 259 Page 4
1 WHEREAS, In the 2019 Legislative Session, Senate Bill No. 276 directed the
2 Legislative Commission to appoint a committee to conduct an interim study
3 concerning the cost of prescription drugs in this State and the impact of rebates,
4 reductions in price and other remuneration from manufacturers on prescription drug
5 prices; and
6 WHEREAS, In reporting on the findings of the Committee to Conduct an Interim
7 Study Concerning the Costs of Prescription Drugs, LCB Bulletin No. 21-9,
8 published in January 2021, stated that “[i]n 2018, Americans paid an average of
9 $1,229 for prescription drugs, the highest amount per capita in any developed
10 country in the world”; and
11 WHEREAS, LCB Bulletin No. 21-9 also stated that “[i]ncreasing drug prices
12 disproportionately affect uninsured and underinsured patients, while insured
13 patients covered by high-deductible, commercial, or government-sponsored health
14 insurance plans tend to pay more through premium and co-pay increases”; and
15 WHEREAS, The Nevada Spending and Government Efficiency Commission
16 noted in its final report, “Final Report of the Nevada Spending and Government
17 Efficiency Commission to Governor Jim Gibbons,” published January 7, 2010, that
18 the State of Nevada would realize significant savings on Medicaid, mental health,
19 corrections and other programs if the cost of prescription drugs were better
20 controlled; and
21 WHEREAS, Excessive prices negatively affect the ability of residents of this
22 State to obtain prescription drugs, thereby endangering the health and safety of such
23 residents; and
24 WHEREAS, Excessive prices of prescription drugs threaten the economic well-
25 being of residents of this State, thereby inhibiting their ability to pay for necessary
26 and essential goods and services including housing, food and utilities; and
27 WHEREAS, Excessive costs of prescription drugs contribute significantly to
28 increasing costs of health care and health insurance that threaten the ability of
29 residents of this State to obtain affordable health coverage and maintain or achieve
30 good health; and
31 WHEREAS, Excessive costs of prescription drugs contribute significantly to
32 rising costs for health care provided and paid for through health insurance programs
33 for public employees, including employees of the State, municipalities, counties,
34 school districts and institutions for higher education and retirees whose health costs
35 are funded by taxpayer dollars, thereby threatening the ability of the State and local
36 governments to fund other programs necessary for the public good and safety, such
37 as public safety, police, fire and education; and
38 WHEREAS, To protect residents of this State from the negative effects from
39 excessive costs of prescription drugs, and to protect the safety, health and economic
40 well-being of Nevadans, the Legislature finds that legislation regarding affordable
41 access to prescription drugs is necessary for residents of this State to achieve and
42 maintain good health; now, therefore,
43

AN ACT relating to health care; prohibiting certain actions related to pricing and

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing federal law establishes the Medicare program, which is a public health insurance
2 program for persons 65 years of age and older and specified persons with disabilities who are

5 drugs and to establish the maximum fair price for certain drugs, which is the maximum price

7 Existing federal law requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to publish those
8 maximum fair prices. (42 U.S.C. § 1320f-4) Section 1 of this bill prohibits a person or entity
9 that: (1) purchases a drug which is subject to a maximum fair price in this State from paying a
10 price that is higher than the maximum fair price; or (2) seeks reimbursement for a drug subject
11 to a maximum fair price which is delivered, dispensed or administered to a person in this State
12 from seeking reimbursement at a rate which is higher than the maximum fair price. Section 1
13 exempts from such prohibitions certain providers of health coverage under federal law
14 but prescribes a procedure by which such a provider of health coverage may elect to be
15 subject to the provisions of section 1.
16 Existing law: (1) prohibits certain trade practices which are deemed to be deceptive trade

20 deceptive trade practice for any person to violate the prohibition on purchasing or seeking
21 reimbursement for a drug at a price higher than the maximum fair price. Sections 1 and 3 of
22 this bill provide that a person who violates the provisions of section 1 is not subject to any
23 criminal penalty set forth in existing law for engaging in a deceptive trade practice, meaning
24 such a person is subject only to the various civil enforcement measures, including civil
25 penalties, set forth in existing law for engaging in a deceptive trade practice. (NRS 598.097-
