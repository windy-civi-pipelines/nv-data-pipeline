AN ACT relating to health care; prohibiting certain actions related
to pricing and reimbursement for certain drugs; creating a
cause of action for violating such prohibitions; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing federal law establishes the Medicare program, which is a public health
2 insurance program for persons 65 years of age and older and specified persons with
3 disabilities who are under 65 years of age. (42 U.S.C. §§ 1395 et seq.) Existing
4 federal law requires the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services to
5 negotiate with the manufacturers of certain drugs and to establish the maximum fair
6 price for certain drugs, which is the maximum price at which such drugs may be
7 sold to a recipient of Medicare. (42 U.S.C. §§ 1320f-2, 1320f-3) Existing federal
8 law requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to publish those
9 maximum fair prices. (42 U.S.C. § 1320f-4) Section 1 of this bill prohibits a person
10 or entity that: (1) purchases a drug which is subject to a maximum fair price in this
11 State from paying a price that is higher than the maximum fair price; or (2) seeks
12 reimbursement for a drug subject to a maximum fair price which is delivered,
13 dispensed or administered to a person in this State from seeking reimbursement at a
14 rate which is higher than the maximum fair price. Section 1 exempts from such
15 prohibitions certain providers of health coverage under federal law but prescribes a
16 procedure by which such a provider of health coverage may elect to be subject to
17 the provisions of section 1.
18 Existing law: (1) prohibits certain trade practices which are deemed to be
19 deceptive trade practices; and (2) provides for the enforcement of the prohibition on
20 engaging in deceptive trade practices, including by prescribing criminal penalties to
21 be imposed against a person who engages in a deceptive trade practice. (NRS
22 598.0903-598.0999) Section 1 makes it a deceptive trade practice for any person to
23 violate the prohibition on purchasing or seeking reimbursement for a drug at a price
24 higher than the maximum fair price. Sections 1 and 3 of this bill provide that a
-
*AB259_R1*
– 2 –
25 person who violates the provisions of section 1 is not subject to any criminal
26 penalty set forth in existing law for engaging in a deceptive trade practice, meaning
27 such a person is subject only to the various civil enforcement measures, including
28 civil penalties, set forth in existing law for engaging in a deceptive trade practice.
29 (NRS 598.097-598.0999)
30 Existing law authorizes any person who is a victim of consumer fraud,
31 including a deceptive trade practice, to bring a civil action. (NRS 41.600) Section 2
32 of this bill provides that a violation of section 1 constitutes consumer fraud, and
33 sections 1 and 2 authorize a victim of such a violation to bring a civil action.
1 WHEREAS, In the 2019 Legislative Session, Senate Bill No. 276
2 directed the Legislative Commission to appoint a committee to
3 conduct an interim study concerning the cost of prescription drugs
4 in this State and the impact of rebates, reductions in price and other
5 remuneration from manufacturers on prescription drug prices; and
6 WHEREAS, In reporting on the findings of the Committee to
7 Conduct an Interim Study Concerning the Costs of Prescription
8 Drugs, LCB Bulletin No. 21-9, published in January 2021, stated
9 that “[i]n 2018, Americans paid an average of $1,229 for
10 prescription drugs, the highest amount per capita in any developed
11 country in the world”; and
12 WHEREAS, LCB Bulletin No. 21-9 also stated that “[i]ncreasing
13 drug prices disproportionately affect uninsured and underinsured
14 patients, while insured patients covered by high-deductible,
15 commercial, or government-sponsored health insurance plans tend
16 to pay more through premium and co-pay increases”; and
17 WHEREAS, The Nevada Spending and Government Efficiency
18 Commission noted in its final report, “Final Report of the Nevada
19 Spending and Government Efficiency Commission to Governor Jim
20 Gibbons,” published January 7, 2010, that the State of Nevada
21 would realize significant savings on Medicaid, mental health,
22 corrections and other programs if the cost of prescription drugs were
23 better controlled; and
24 WHEREAS, Excessive prices negatively affect the ability of
25 residents of this State to obtain prescription drugs, thereby
26 endangering the health and safety of such residents; and
27 WHEREAS, Excessive prices of prescription drugs threaten the
28 economic well-being of residents of this State, thereby inhibiting
29 their ability to pay for necessary and essential goods and services
30 including housing, food and utilities; and
31 WHEREAS, Excessive costs of prescription drugs contribute
32 significantly to increasing costs of health care and health insurance
33 that threaten the ability of residents of this State to obtain affordable
34 health coverage and maintain or achieve good health; and
-
*AB259_R1*
– 3 –
1 WHEREAS, Excessive costs of prescription drugs contribute
2 significantly to rising costs for health care provided and paid for
3 through health insurance programs for public employees, including
4 employees of the State, municipalities, counties, school districts and
5 institutions for higher education and retirees whose health costs are
6 funded by taxpayer dollars, thereby threatening the ability of the
7 State and local governments to fund other programs necessary for
8 the public good and safety, such as public safety, police, fire and
9 education; and
10 WHEREAS, To protect residents of this State from the negative
11 effects from excessive costs of prescription drugs, and to protect the
12 safety, health and economic well-being of Nevadans, the Legislature
13 finds that legislation regarding affordable access to prescription
14 drugs is necessary for residents of this State to achieve and maintain
15 good health; now, therefore,
