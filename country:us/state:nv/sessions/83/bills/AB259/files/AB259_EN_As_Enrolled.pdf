Assembly Bill No. 259–Assemblymembers
Considine; and Anderson
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to health care; prohibiting certain actions related
to pricing and reimbursement for certain drugs; creating a
cause of action for violating such prohibitions; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing federal law establishes the Medicare program, which is a public health
insurance program for persons 65 years of age and older and specified persons with
disabilities who are under 65 years of age. (42 U.S.C. §§ 1395 et seq.) Existing
federal law requires the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services to
negotiate with the manufacturers of certain drugs and to establish the maximum fair
price for certain drugs, which is the maximum price at which such drugs may be
sold to a recipient of Medicare. (42 U.S.C. §§ 1320f-2, 1320f-3) Existing federal
law requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to publish those
maximum fair prices. (42 U.S.C. § 1320f-4) Section 1 of this bill prohibits a person
or entity that: (1) purchases a drug which is subject to a maximum fair price in this
State from paying a price that is higher than the maximum fair price; or (2) seeks
reimbursement for a drug subject to a maximum fair price which is delivered,
dispensed or administered to a person in this State from seeking reimbursement at a
rate which is higher than the maximum fair price. Section 1 exempts from such
prohibitions certain providers of health coverage under federal law but prescribes a
procedure by which such a provider of health coverage may elect to be subject to
the provisions of section 1.
Existing law: (1) prohibits certain trade practices which are deemed to be
deceptive trade practices; and (2) provides for the enforcement of the prohibition on
engaging in deceptive trade practices, including by prescribing criminal penalties to
be imposed against a person who engages in a deceptive trade practice. (NRS
598.0903-598.0999) Section 1 makes it a deceptive trade practice for any person to
violate the prohibition on purchasing or seeking reimbursement for a drug at a price
higher than the maximum fair price. Sections 1 and 3 of this bill provide that a
person who violates the provisions of section 1 is not subject to any criminal
penalty set forth in existing law for engaging in a deceptive trade practice, meaning
such a person is subject only to the various civil enforcement measures, including
civil penalties, set forth in existing law for engaging in a deceptive trade practice.
(NRS 598.097-598.0999)
Existing law authorizes any person who is a victim of consumer fraud,
including a deceptive trade practice, to bring a civil action. (NRS 41.600) Section 2
of this bill provides that a violation of section 1 constitutes consumer fraud, and
sections 1 and 2 authorize a victim of such a violation to bring a civil action.

WHEREAS, In the 2019 Legislative Session, Senate Bill No. 276
directed the Legislative Commission to appoint a committee to
conduct an interim study concerning the cost of prescription drugs
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 2 –
in this State and the impact of rebates, reductions in price and other
remuneration from manufacturers on prescription drug prices; and
WHEREAS, In reporting on the findings of the Committee to
Conduct an Interim Study Concerning the Costs of Prescription
Drugs, LCB Bulletin No. 21-9, published in January 2021, stated
that “[i]n 2018, Americans paid an average of $1,229 for
prescription drugs, the highest amount per capita in any developed
country in the world”; and
WHEREAS, LCB Bulletin No. 21-9 also stated that “[i]ncreasing
drug prices disproportionately affect uninsured and underinsured
patients, while insured patients covered by high-deductible,
commercial, or government-sponsored health insurance plans tend
to pay more through premium and co-pay increases”; and
WHEREAS, The Nevada Spending and Government Efficiency
Commission noted in its final report, “Final Report of the Nevada
Spending and Government Efficiency Commission to Governor Jim
Gibbons,” published January 7, 2010, that the State of Nevada
would realize significant savings on Medicaid, mental health,
corrections and other programs if the cost of prescription drugs were
better controlled; and
WHEREAS, Excessive prices negatively affect the ability of
residents of this State to obtain prescription drugs, thereby
endangering the health and safety of such residents; and
WHEREAS, Excessive prices of prescription drugs threaten the
economic well-being of residents of this State, thereby inhibiting
their ability to pay for necessary and essential goods and services
including housing, food and utilities; and
WHEREAS, Excessive costs of prescription drugs contribute
significantly to increasing costs of health care and health insurance
that threaten the ability of residents of this State to obtain affordable
health coverage and maintain or achieve good health; and
WHEREAS, Excessive costs of prescription drugs contribute
significantly to rising costs for health care provided and paid for
through health insurance programs for public employees, including
employees of the State, municipalities, counties, school districts and
institutions for higher education and retirees whose health costs are
funded by taxpayer dollars, thereby threatening the ability of the
State and local governments to fund other programs necessary for
the public good and safety, such as public safety, police, fire and
education; and
WHEREAS, To protect residents of this State from the negative
effects from excessive costs of prescription drugs, and to protect the
safety, health and economic well-being of Nevadans, the Legislature
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 3 –
finds that legislation regarding affordable access to prescription
drugs is necessary for residents of this State to achieve and maintain
good health; now, therefore,
