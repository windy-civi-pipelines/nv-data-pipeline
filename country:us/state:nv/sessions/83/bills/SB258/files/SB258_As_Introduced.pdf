EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to industrial insurance; revising provisions
governing certain civil actions involving injured
employees; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the payment of compensation under industrial
2 insurance if, during the course of employment, an employee is injured or killed by a
3 workplace accident or occupational disease. (Chapters 616A-617 of NRS) Existing
4 law defines the term “compensation” to mean the money which is payable to an
5 employee or to the dependents of the employee as provided in existing law
6 governing industrial insurance, including benefits for funerals, accident benefits or
7 medical benefits and money for rehabilitative services. (NRS 616A.090, 617.050)
8 If the injury of an injured employee was caused under circumstances entitling
9 the employee to recover another payment from the employer for the injury in the
10 form of a gift, settlement or otherwise, existing law requires the amount of
11 compensation to which the injured employee or the dependents of the employee are
-
*SB258*

– 2 –
12 entitled, including any future compensation, to be reduced by the additional amount
13 paid by the employer. Existing law provides that the industrial insurer or
14 Administrator of the Division of Industrial Relations of the Department of Business
15 and Industry has a lien against the total amount paid by the employer.
16 (NRS 616C.215)
17 If the injury of an injured employee was caused under circumstances creating
18 legal liability in a person other than the employer or a person in the same employ,
19 or entitling the employee or the dependents of the employee to receive proceeds
20 under his or her employer’s policy of uninsured or underinsured vehicle coverage,
21 existing law authorizes an injured employee or the dependents of the employee,
22 under certain circumstances, to take proceedings to recover damages from that third
23 party or to recover those proceeds under the policy. Existing law also authorizes the
24 industrial insurer or Administrator, under certain circumstances, to recover
25 damages from that third party or recover proceeds under the policy. Additionally,
26 under existing law, the industrial insurer or Administrator has a lien against the
27 total proceeds of any recovery by the injured employee or the dependents of the
28 employee. Existing law requires the amount of compensation to which the injured
29 employee or the dependents of the employee are entitled, including any future
30 compensation, to be reduced by the amount of damages or proceeds recovered.
31 (NRS 616C.215)
32 This bill limits the reduction of compensation, including future compensation,
33 to a reduction based on the portion of any amount paid or the portion of damages or
34 proceeds recovered which represents economic damages. This bill also provides
35 that the industrial insurer or Administrator only has a lien upon the portion of any
36 amount paid or the portion of any judgment, settlement or otherwise which
37 represents economic damages, instead of the total amount paid or the total proceeds
38 of any recovery. This bill defines the term “economic damages,” in accordance
39 with provisions of existing law, to mean damages for medical treatment, care or
40 custody, loss of earnings and loss of earning capacity. (NRS 41A.007)
41 This bill provides that the injured employee or the dependents of the employee
42 are entitled to be made whole for the injury, and a lien amount is recoverable only
43 if the injured employee or the dependents of the employee have been made whole.
44 This bill: (1) requires adjustment of the lien amount to reflect a proportional share
45 of any expenses incurred by the injured employee or the dependents of the
46 employee in procuring the payment or recovery; (2) limits the lien amount to the
47 compensation received by the injured employee or dependents of the employee; and
48 (3) excludes from the lien the amount of any benefit penalty or certain other
49 administrative fines.
50 Existing law requires an injured employee or the dependents of the employee,
51 or the attorney or representative of the injured employee or the dependents, to
52 notify the industrial insurer or the Administrator in writing before initiating certain
53 proceedings or actions. (NRS 616C.215) This bill removes that requirement.
54 Existing law generally provides that an action to recover damages for an injury or
55 death of a person must be commenced within 2 years. (NRS 11.190) This bill
56 prohibits an industrial insurer or the Administrator from initiating certain
57 proceedings or actions against a person other than the employer or a person in the
58 same employ unless the injured employee or the dependents of the employee has
59 not initiated a proceeding or action within 1 year of the date on which the injury
60 occurred. If the industrial insurer or Administrator initiates such a proceeding or
61 action, this bill: (1) requires the industrial insurer or the Administrator to
62 immediately notify the injured employee or the dependents of the employee, or an
63 attorney or representative of the injured employee or the dependents, of the
64 proceeding or action in writing; and (2) entitles the injured employee or the
65 dependents of the employee to intervene in the proceeding or action.

66 In any trial of certain actions against a person other than the employer or a
67 person in the same employ, existing law requires that the jury must receive: (1)
68 proof of the amount of all payments made or to be made by the insurer or
69 Administrator; and (2) certain instructions from the court. (NRS 616C.215) This
70 bill removes those requirements and instead prohibits the jury from receiving proof
71 of any such payments. This bill provides that evidence of the amount of
72 compensation, accident benefits and other expenditures which the insurer or certain
73 accounts under control of the Administrator have paid or become obligated to pay
74 is not admissible at trial.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 616C.215 is hereby amended to read as
2 follows:
3 616C.215 1. If an injured employee or, in the event of his or
4 her death, the dependents of the employee, bring an action in tort
5 against his or her employer to recover payment for an injury which
6 is compensable pursuant to the provisions of chapters 616A to
7 616D, inclusive, or chapter 617 of NRS and, notwithstanding the
8 provisions of NRS 616A.020, receive payment from the employer
9 for that injury:
10 (a) The amount of compensation the injured employee or the
11 dependents of the employee are entitled to receive pursuant to the
12 provisions of chapters 616A to 616D, inclusive, or chapter 617 of
13 NRS, including any future compensation, must be reduced by the
14 portion of any amount paid by the employer [.] which represents
15 economic damages.
16 (b) The insurer, or in the case of claims involving the Uninsured
17 Employers’ Claim Account or a subsequent injury account the
18 Administrator, has a lien upon the [total] portion of any amount
19 paid by the employer which represents economic damages if the
20 injured employee or the dependents of the employee receive
21 compensation pursuant to the provisions of chapters 616A to 616D,
22 inclusive, or chapter 617 of NRS.
23  This subsection is applicable whether the money paid to the
24 employee or the dependents of the employee by the employer is
25 classified as a gift, a settlement or otherwise. The provisions of this
26 subsection do not grant to an injured employee any right of action in
27 tort to recover damages from the employer for the injury.
28 2. When an employee receives an injury for which
29 compensation is payable pursuant to the provisions of chapters
30 616A to 616D, inclusive, or chapter 617 of NRS and which was
31 caused under circumstances creating a legal liability in some person,
32 other than the employer or a person in the same employ, to pay
33 damages in respect thereof:
-
*SB258*

– 4 –
1 (a) The injured employee, or in case of death the dependents of
2 the employee, may take proceedings against that person to recover
3 damages, but the amount of the compensation the injured employee
4 or the dependents of the employee are entitled to receive pursuant to
5 the provisions of chapters 616A to 616D, inclusive, or chapter 617
6 of NRS, including any future compensation, must be reduced by the
7 [amount] portion of the damages recovered [,] which represents
8 economic damages, notwithstanding any act or omission of the
9 employer or a person in the same employ which was a direct or
10 proximate cause of the employee’s injury.
11 (b) If the injured employee, or in case of death the dependents of
12 the employee, receive compensation pursuant to the provisions of
13 chapters 616A to 616D, inclusive, or chapter 617 of NRS, the
14 insurer, or in case of claims involving the Uninsured Employers’
15 Claim Account or a subsequent injury account the Administrator,
16 has a right of action against the person so liable to pay economic
17 damages and is subrogated to the rights of the injured employee or
18 of the employee’s dependents to recover [therefor.] such economic
19 damages.
20 (c) The injured employee, or in the case of death the
21 dependents of the employee, must initiate any proceeding or action
22 within the applicable statute of limitations. The insurer, or in the
23 case of claims involving the Uninsured Employers’ Claim Account
24 or a subsequent injury account, the Administrator, may not
25 initiate a proceeding or action pursuant to this subsection unless
26 the injured employee, or in the case of death the dependents of the
27 employee, has not initiated a proceeding or action pursuant to this
28 subsection within 1 year after the date on which the injury
29 occurred. If the insurer or Administrator, as applicable, initiates a
30 proceeding or action pursuant to this subsection, the insurer or
31 Administrator shall immediately notify the injured employee or the
32 dependents of the employee, or the attorney or representative of
33 the injured employee or the dependents of the employee, of such a
34 proceeding or action in writing. The injured employee or the
35 dependents of the employee are entitled to intervene in the
36 proceeding or action.
37 3. When an injured employee incurs an injury for which
38 compensation is payable pursuant to the provisions of chapters
39 616A to 616D, inclusive, or chapter 617 of NRS and which was
40 caused under circumstances entitling the employee, or in the case of
41 death the dependents of the employee, to receive proceeds under his
42 or her employer’s policy of uninsured or underinsured vehicle
43 coverage:
44 (a) The injured employee, or in the case of death the dependents
45 of the employee, may take proceedings to recover those proceeds,
-
*SB258*

– 5 –
1 but the amount of compensation the injured employee or the
2 dependents of the employee are entitled to receive pursuant to the
3 provisions of chapters 616A to 616D, inclusive, or chapter 617 of
4 NRS, including any future compensation, must be reduced by the
5 [amount] portion of proceeds received [.] which represents
6 economic damages.

8 dependents of the employee, receive compensation pursuant to the
9 provisions of chapters 616A to 616D, inclusive, or chapter 617 of
10 NRS, the insurer, or in the case of claims involving the Uninsured
11 Employers’ Claim Account or a subsequent injury account the
12 Administrator, is subrogated to the rights of the injured employee or
13 the dependents of the employee to recover the portion of proceeds
14 which represents economic damages under the employer’s policy
15 of uninsured or underinsured vehicle coverage. The insurer and the
16 Administrator are not subrogated to the rights of an injured
17 employee or the dependents of the employee under a policy of
18 uninsured or underinsured vehicle coverage purchased by the
19 employee.
20 (c) Any provision in the employer’s policy of uninsured or
21 underinsured vehicle coverage which has the effect of:
22 (1) Limiting the rights of the injured employee or the
23 dependents of the employee to recover proceeds under the policy
24 because of the receipt of any compensation pursuant to the
25 provisions of chapters 616A to 616D, inclusive, or chapter 617 of
26 NRS;
27 (2) Limiting the rights of subrogation of the insurer or
28 Administrator provided by paragraph (b); or
29 (3) Excluding coverage which inures to the direct or indirect
30 benefit of the insurer or Administrator,
31  is void.
32 4. In any action or proceedings taken by the insurer or the
33 Administrator pursuant to this section [, evidence] :
34 (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection 10, evidence of
35 the amount of compensation, accident benefits and other
36 expenditures which the insurer, the Uninsured Employers’ Claim
37 Account or a subsequent injury account have paid or become
38 obligated to pay by reason of the injury or death of the employee is
39 admissible.
40 (b) If in such action or proceedings the insurer or the
41 Administrator recovers more than [those] the amounts [,] described
42 in paragraph (a), the excess must be paid to the injured employee
43 or the dependents of the employee.
44 5. In any case where the insurer or the Administrator is
45 subrogated to the rights of the injured employee or of the
-
*SB258*

– 6 –
1 employee’s dependents as provided in subsection 2 or 3, the insurer
2 or the Administrator has a lien upon the [total proceeds] portion of
3 any recovery from some person other than the employer [,] which
4 represents economic damages, whether the proceeds of such
5 recovery are by way of judgment, settlement or otherwise. The
6 injured employee, or in the case of his or her death the dependents
7 of the employee, are [not] entitled to [double recovery] be made
8 whole for the [same injury, notwithstanding any act or omission of
9 the employer or a person in the same employ which was a direct or
10 proximate cause of the employee’s] injury.
11 6. The lien provided for pursuant to subsection 1 or 5
12 [includes] :
13 (a) Includes only the total compensation expenditure incurred
14 by the insurer, the Uninsured Employers’ Claim Account or a
15 subsequent injury account for the injured employee and the
16 dependents of the employee [.] ;
17 (b) Is recoverable only if the injured employee, or in the case
18 of his or her death the dependents of the employee, has been made
19 whole for the injury; and
20 (c) Must be adjusted to reflect a pro rata share of any expenses
21 incurred by the injured employee or the dependents of the
22 employee in procuring the recovery.
23 7. An injured employee, or in the case of death the dependents
24 of the employee, or the attorney or representative of the injured
25 employee or the dependents of the employee, [shall] may notify the
26 insurer, or in the case of claims involving the Uninsured Employers’
27 Claim Account or a subsequent injury account the Administrator, in
28 writing before initiating a proceeding or action pursuant to this
29 section.
30 8. Within 15 days after the date of recovery by way of actual
31 receipt of the proceeds of the judgment, settlement or otherwise:
32 (a) The injured employee or the dependents of the employee, or
33 the attorney or representative of the injured employee or the
34 dependents of the employee; and
35 (b) The third-party insurer,
36  shall notify the insurer, or in the case of claims involving the
37 Uninsured Employers’ Claim Account or a subsequent injury
38 account the Administrator, of the recovery and pay to the insurer or
39 the Administrator, respectively, the amount due pursuant to this
40 section together with an itemized statement showing the distribution
41 of the total recovery. The attorney or representative of the injured
42 employee or the dependents of the employee and the third-party
43 insurer are jointly and severally liable for any amount to which an
44 insurer is entitled pursuant to this section if the attorney,
-
*SB258*

– 7 –
1 representative or third-party insurer has knowledge of the lien
2 provided for in this section.
3 9. An insurer shall not sell its lien to a third-party insurer
4 unless the injured employee or the dependents of the employee, or
5 the attorney or representative of the injured employee or the
6 dependents of the employee, refuses to provide to the insurer
7 information concerning the action against the third party.
8 10. In any trial of an action [by the injured employee, or in the
9 case of his or her death by the dependents of the employee,]
10 pursuant to subsection 2 against a person other than the employer
11 or a person in the same employ, evidence of the amount of
12 compensation, accident benefits and other expenditures which the
13 insurer, the Uninsured Employers’ Claim Account or a
14 subsequent injury account have paid or become obligated to pay is
15 not admissible and the jury must not receive proof of [the amount
16 of all] any payments made or to be made by the employer, insurer or
17 the Administrator. [The court shall instruct the jury substantially as
18 follows:
19
20 Payment of workmen’s compensation benefits by the
21 insurer, or in the case of claims involving the Uninsured
22 Employers’ Claim Account or a subsequent injury account
23 the Administrator, is based upon the fact that a compensable
24 industrial accident occurred, and does not depend upon blame
25 or fault. If the plaintiff does not obtain a judgment in his or
26 her favor in this case, the plaintiff is not required to repay his
27 or her employer, the insurer or the Administrator any amount
28 paid to the plaintiff or paid on the behalf of the plaintiff by
29 the plaintiff’s employer, the insurer or the Administrator.
30 If you decide that the plaintiff is entitled to judgment
31 against the defendant, you shall find damages for the plaintiff
32 in accordance with the court’s instructions on damages and
33 return your verdict in the plaintiff’s favor in the amount so
34 found without deducting the amount of any compensation
35 benefits paid to or for the plaintiff. The law provides a means
36 by which any compensation benefits will be repaid from your
37 award.]
38
39 11. To calculate an employer’s premium, the employer’s
40 account with the private carrier must be credited with an amount
41 equal to that recovered by the private carrier from a third party
42 pursuant to this section, less the private carrier’s share of the
43 expenses of litigation incurred in obtaining the recovery, except that
44 the total credit must not exceed the amount of compensation
-
*SB258*

– 8 –
1 actually paid or reserved by the private carrier on the injured
2 employee’s claim.
3 12. As used in this section [, “third-party] :
4 (a) “Economic damages” has the meaning ascribed to it in
5 NRS 41A.007.
6 (b) “Third-party insurer” means an insurer that issued to a third
7 party who is liable for damages pursuant to subsection 2, a policy of
8 liability insurance the proceeds of which are recoverable pursuant to
9 this section. The term includes an insurer that issued to an employer
10 a policy of uninsured or underinsured vehicle coverage.
11 (c) “Total compensation expenditure” means compensation
12 received by an employee or the dependents of the employee. The
13 term does not include a benefit penalty or other administrative fine
14 imposed pursuant to NRS 616D.120.

16 any:

18 to the provisions of NRS 616C.215, as that section existed before

21 been entered by the effective date of this act.
22 (b) Claim for compensation pursuant to chapters 616A to 616D,
23 inclusive, or 617 of NRS, which is open on or filed on or after the
24 effective date of this act.
25 2. As used in this section, “compensation” has the meaning
26 ascribed to it in NRS 616A.090 or 617.050, as applicable.
