(BDR 53-594)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to industrial insurance; revising provisions
governing certain civil actions involving injured
employees; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the payment of compensation under industrial
2 insurance if, during the course of employment, an employee is injured or killed by a
3 workplace accident or occupational disease. (Chapters 616A-617 of NRS) Existing
4 law defines the term “compensation” to mean the money which is payable to an
5 employee or to the dependents of the employee as provided in existing law
6 governing industrial insurance, including benefits for funerals, accident benefits or
7 medical benefits and money for rehabilitative services. (NRS 616A.090, 617.050)
8 If the injury of an injured employee was caused under circumstances creating
9 legal liability in a person other than the employer or a person in the same employ,
10 existing law authorizes an injured employee or the dependents of the employee,
11 under certain circumstances, to take proceedings to recover damages from that third

12 party. Existing law also authorizes the industrial insurer or Administrator, under
13 certain circumstances, to recover damages from that third party. Additionally, under
14 existing law, the industrial insurer or Administrator has a lien against the total
15 proceeds of any recovery by the injured employee or the dependents of the
16 employee. Existing law requires the amount of compensation to which the injured
17 employee or the dependents of the employee are entitled, including any future
18 compensation, to be reduced by the amount of damages or proceeds recovered.
19 (NRS 616C.215)
20 This bill provides that the maximum amount that the industrial insurer or
21 Administrator may recover for such a lien must be the lesser of: (1) the full amount
22 of the lien; or (2) one-third of the total amount of any recovery, inclusive of any
23 attorney’s fees or costs.
24 Except where the full amount of the lien may be recovered, this bill requires the
25 lien amount to be reduced by an amount equal to one-half of the reasonable
26 expenses incurred by the injured employee or the dependents of the employee in
27 procuring the recovery, which must be verified by a certified public accountant and
28 is subject to judicial review under certain circumstances. This bill also limits any
29 offset to the amount of future compensation received by the injured employee or
30 dependents of the employee to: (1) an offset against payments of compensation that
31 are not accident benefits; and (2) a reduction in each such payment which does not
32 exceed one-third of the amount of the payment until the total amount of all such
33 reductions equals the total amount recovered, less any applicable reductions.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 616C.215 is hereby amended to read as
2 follows:
3 616C.215 1. If an injured employee or, in the event of his or
4 her death, the dependents of the employee, bring an action in tort
5 against his or her employer to recover payment for an injury which
6 is compensable pursuant to the provisions of chapters 616A to
7 616D, inclusive, or chapter 617 of NRS and, notwithstanding the
8 provisions of NRS 616A.020, receive payment from the employer
9 for that injury:
10 (a) The amount of compensation the injured employee or the
11 dependents of the employee are entitled to receive pursuant to the
12 provisions of chapters 616A to 616D, inclusive, or chapter 617 of
13 NRS, including any future compensation, must be reduced by the
14 amount paid by the employer.
15 (b) The insurer, or in the case of claims involving the Uninsured
16 Employers’ Claim Account or a subsequent injury account the
17 Administrator, has a lien upon the total amount paid by the
18 employer if the injured employee or the dependents of the employee
19 receive compensation pursuant to the provisions of chapters 616A to
20 616D, inclusive, or chapter 617 of NRS.
21  This subsection is applicable whether the money paid to the
22 employee or the dependents of the employee by the employer is
-
*SB258_R1*
– 3 –
1 classified as a gift, a settlement or otherwise. The provisions of this
2 subsection do not grant to an injured employee any right of action in
3 tort to recover damages from the employer for the injury.
4 2. When an employee receives an injury for which
5 compensation is payable pursuant to the provisions of chapters
6 616A to 616D, inclusive, or chapter 617 of NRS and which was
7 caused under circumstances creating a legal liability in some person,
8 other than the employer or a person in the same employ, to pay
9 damages in respect thereof:
10 (a) The injured employee, or in case of death the dependents of
11 the employee, may take proceedings against that person to recover
12 damages, but the amount of the compensation the injured employee
13 or the dependents of the employee are entitled to receive pursuant to
14 the provisions of chapters 616A to 616D, inclusive, or chapter 617
15 of NRS, including any future compensation, must be reduced by the
16 amount of the damages recovered, notwithstanding any act or
17 omission of the employer or a person in the same employ which was
18 a direct or proximate cause of the employee’s injury.
19 (b) If the injured employee, or in case of death the dependents of
20 the employee, receive compensation pursuant to the provisions of
21 chapters 616A to 616D, inclusive, or chapter 617 of NRS, the
22 insurer, or in case of claims involving the Uninsured Employers’
23 Claim Account or a subsequent injury account the Administrator,
24 has a right of action against the person so liable to pay damages and
25 is subrogated to the rights of the injured employee or of the
26 employee’s dependents to recover therefor.
27 3. When an injured employee incurs an injury for which
28 compensation is payable pursuant to the provisions of chapters
29 616A to 616D, inclusive, or chapter 617 of NRS and which was
30 caused under circumstances entitling the employee, or in the case of
31 death the dependents of the employee, to receive proceeds under his
32 or her employer’s policy of uninsured or underinsured vehicle
33 coverage:
34 (a) The injured employee, or in the case of death the dependents
35 of the employee, may take proceedings to recover those proceeds,
36 but the amount of compensation the injured employee or the
37 dependents of the employee are entitled to receive pursuant to the
38 provisions of chapters 616A to 616D, inclusive, or chapter 617 of
39 NRS, including any future compensation, must be reduced by the
40 amount of proceeds received.
41 (b) If an injured employee, or in the case of death the
42 dependents of the employee, receive compensation pursuant to the
43 provisions of chapters 616A to 616D, inclusive, or chapter 617 of
44 NRS, the insurer, or in the case of claims involving the Uninsured
45 Employers’ Claim Account or a subsequent injury account the
-
*SB258_R1*
– 4 –
1 Administrator, is subrogated to the rights of the injured employee or
2 the dependents of the employee to recover proceeds under the
3 employer’s policy of uninsured or underinsured vehicle coverage.
4 The insurer and the Administrator are not subrogated to the rights of
5 an injured employee or the dependents of the employee under a
6 policy of uninsured or underinsured vehicle coverage purchased by
7 the employee.
8 (c) Any provision in the employer’s policy of uninsured or
9 underinsured vehicle coverage which has the effect of:
10 (1) Limiting the rights of the injured employee or the
11 dependents of the employee to recover proceeds under the policy
12 because of the receipt of any compensation pursuant to the
13 provisions of chapters 616A to 616D, inclusive, or chapter 617 of
14 NRS;
15 (2) Limiting the rights of subrogation of the insurer or
16 Administrator provided by paragraph (b); or
17 (3) Excluding coverage which inures to the direct or indirect
18 benefit of the insurer or Administrator,
19  is void.
20 4. In any action or proceedings taken by the insurer or the
21 Administrator pursuant to this section, evidence of the amount of
22 compensation, accident benefits and other expenditures which the
23 insurer, the Uninsured Employers’ Claim Account or a subsequent
24 injury account have paid or become obligated to pay by reason of
25 the injury or death of the employee is admissible.
26 If in such action or proceedings the insurer or the Administrator
27 recovers more than those amounts, the excess must be paid to the
28 injured employee or the dependents of the employee.
29 5. [In] Except as otherwise provided in subsection 7, in any
30 case where the insurer or the Administrator is subrogated to the
31 rights of the injured employee or of the employee’s dependents as
32 provided in subsection 2 or 3, the insurer or the Administrator has a
33 lien upon the total proceeds of any recovery from some person other
34 than the employer, whether the proceeds of such recovery are by
35 way of judgment, settlement or otherwise. The injured employee, or
36 in the case of his or her death the dependents of the employee, are
37 not entitled to double recovery for the same injury, notwithstanding
38 any act or omission of the employer or a person in the same employ
39 which was a direct or proximate cause of the employee’s injury.
40 6. [The] Except as otherwise provided in subsection 7, the lien
41 provided for pursuant to subsection 1 or 5 includes the total
42 compensation expenditure incurred by the insurer, the Uninsured
43 Employers’ Claim Account or a subsequent injury account for the
44 injured employee and the dependents of the employee.
45 7. For a lien provided for pursuant to subsection 5:
-
*SB258_R1*
– 5 –
1 (a) The maximum amount which the insurer or Administrator
2 may recover must be the lesser of:
3 (1) The full amount of the lien; or
4 (2) One-third of the total amount recovered from the person
5 other than the employer or person in the same employ. As used in
6 this subparagraph, “total amount recovered” means the total
7 proceeds described in subsection 5, including, without limitation,
8 any attorney’s fees or costs.
9 (b) Except under circumstances in which the full amount of
10 the lien is recoverable pursuant to subparagraph (1) of paragraph
11 (a), the lien must be reduced by an amount equal to one-half of
12 the reasonable expenses incurred by the injured employee, or in
13 the case of death the dependents of the employee, in prosecuting
14 or settling the claim against a person other than the employer or
15 person in the same employ. The accounting of any such
16 reasonable expenses:
17 (1) Must be verified by a certified public accountant
18 certified or licensed to practice in this State or in any other state.
19 The injured employee, the attorney or representative of the injured
20 employee or the dependents of the employee shall provide the
21 verified accounting to the insurer or Administrator.
22 (2) Is subject to judicial review in a court of competent
23 jurisdiction, if a petition is filed within 30 days after the date on
24 which the insurer or Administrator receives a verified accounting
25 pursuant to subparagraph (1).
26 (c) If the insurer or Administrator imposes an offset to the
27 amount of future compensation that the injured employee, or in
28 the case of death the dependents of the employee, is entitled to
29 receive:
30 (1) Such an offset may be applied only against payments of
31 compensation that are not accident benefits; and
32 (2) Each individual payment to which the offset applied
33 must be reduced by not more than one-third of the amount
34 otherwise owed until the total amount of all such reductions
35 equals the total amount recovered, as defined in subparagraph (1)
36 of paragraph (a), less any reductions imposed pursuant to
37 paragraphs (a) and (b).
38 8. An injured employee, or in the case of death the dependents
39 of the employee, or the attorney or representative of the injured
40 employee or the dependents of the employee, shall notify the
41 insurer, or in the case of claims involving the Uninsured Employers’
42 Claim Account or a subsequent injury account the Administrator, in
43 writing before initiating a proceeding or action pursuant to this
44 section.

*SB258_R1*
– 6 –
1 [8.] 9. Within 15 days after the date of recovery by way of
2 actual receipt of the proceeds of the judgment, settlement or
3 otherwise:
4 (a) The injured employee or the dependents of the employee, or
5 the attorney or representative of the injured employee or the
6 dependents of the employee; and
7 (b) The third-party insurer,
8  shall notify the insurer, or in the case of claims involving the
9 Uninsured Employers’ Claim Account or a subsequent injury
10 account the Administrator, of the recovery and pay to the insurer or
11 the Administrator, respectively, the amount due pursuant to this
12 section together with an itemized statement showing the distribution
13 of the total recovery. The attorney or representative of the injured
14 employee or the dependents of the employee and the third-party
15 insurer are jointly and severally liable for any amount to which an
16 insurer is entitled pursuant to this section if the attorney,
17 representative or third-party insurer has knowledge of the lien
18 provided for in this section.
19 [9.] 10. An insurer shall not sell its lien to a third-party insurer
20 unless the injured employee or the dependents of the employee, or
21 the attorney or representative of the injured employee or the
22 dependents of the employee, refuses to provide to the insurer
23 information concerning the action against the third party.
24 [10.] 11. In any trial of an action by the injured employee, or in
25 the case of his or her death by the dependents of the employee,
26 against a person other than the employer or a person in the same
27 employ, the jury must receive proof of the amount of all payments
28 made or to be made by the insurer or the Administrator. The court
29 shall instruct the jury substantially as follows:
30
31 Payment of workmen’s compensation benefits by the
32 insurer, or in the case of claims involving the Uninsured
33 Employers’ Claim Account or a subsequent injury account
34 the Administrator, is based upon the fact that a compensable
35 industrial accident occurred, and does not depend upon blame
36 or fault. If the plaintiff does not obtain a judgment in his or
37 her favor in this case, the plaintiff is not required to repay his
38 or her employer, the insurer or the Administrator any amount
39 paid to the plaintiff or paid on the behalf of the plaintiff by
40 the plaintiff’s employer, the insurer or the Administrator.
41 If you decide that the plaintiff is entitled to judgment
42 against the defendant, you shall find damages for the plaintiff
43 in accordance with the court’s instructions on damages and
44 return your verdict in the plaintiff’s favor in the amount so
45 found without deducting the amount of any compensation
-
*SB258_R1*
– 7 –
1 benefits paid to or for the plaintiff. The law provides a means
2 by which any compensation benefits will be repaid from your
3 award.
4
5 [11.] 12. To calculate an employer’s premium, the employer’s
6 account with the private carrier must be credited with an amount
7 equal to that recovered by the private carrier from a third party
8 pursuant to this section, less the private carrier’s share of the
9 expenses of litigation incurred in obtaining the recovery, except that
10 the total credit must not exceed the amount of compensation
11 actually paid or reserved by the private carrier on the injured
12 employee’s claim.
13 [12.] 13. As used in this section, “third-party insurer” means
14 an insurer that issued to a third party who is liable for damages
15 pursuant to subsection 2, a policy of liability insurance the proceeds
16 of which are recoverable pursuant to this section. The term includes
17 an insurer that issued to an employer a policy of uninsured or
18 underinsured vehicle coverage.
19 Sec. 2. 1. The amendatory provisions of this act apply to
20 any:
21 (a) Action or proceeding initiated pursuant to or which is subject
22 to the provisions of NRS 616C.215, as that section existed before
23 the effective date of this act, or as amended by section 1 of this act,
24 in which a final judgment, settlement or other disposition has not
25 been entered by the effective date of this act.
26 (b) Claim for compensation pursuant to chapters 616A to 616D,
27 inclusive, or 617 of NRS, which is open on or filed on or after the
28 effective date of this act.
29 2. As used in this section, “compensation” has the meaning
30 ascribed to it in NRS 616A.090 or 617.050, as applicable.
31 Sec. 3. This act becomes effective upon passage and approval.

AN ACT relating to industrial insurance; revising provisions
governing certain civil actions involving injured
employees; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the payment of compensation under industrial
2 insurance if, during the course of employment, an employee is injured or killed by a

4 law defines the term “compensation” to mean the money which is payable to an

12 party. Existing law also authorizes the industrial insurer or Administrator, under
13 certain circumstances, to recover damages from that third party. Additionally, under
14 existing law, the industrial insurer or Administrator has a lien against the total
15 proceeds of any recovery by the injured employee or the dependents of the
16 employee. Existing law requires the amount of compensation to which the injured
17 employee or the dependents of the employee are entitled, including any future
18 compensation, to be reduced by the amount of damages or proceeds recovered.
19 (NRS 616C.215)
20 This bill provides that the maximum amount that the industrial insurer or
21 Administrator may recover for such a lien must be the lesser of: (1) the full amount
22 of the lien; or (2) one-third of the total amount of any recovery, inclusive of any
23 attorney’s fees or costs.
24 Except where the full amount of the lien may be recovered, this bill requires the
25 lien amount to be reduced by an amount equal to one-half of the reasonable
26 expenses incurred by the injured employee or the dependents of the employee in
27 procuring the recovery, which must be verified by a certified public accountant and
28 is subject to judicial review under certain circumstances. This bill also limits any
29 offset to the amount of future compensation received by the injured employee or
30 dependents of the employee to: (1) an offset against payments of compensation that
31 are not accident benefits; and (2) a reduction in each such payment which does not
32 exceed one-third of the amount of the payment until the total amount of all such
33 reductions equals the total amount recovered, less any applicable reductions.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 616C.215 is hereby amended to read as
2 follows:
3 616C.215 1. If an injured employee or, in the event of his or
4 her death, the dependents of the employee, bring an action in tort
5 against his or her employer to recover payment for an injury which
6 is compensable pursuant to the provisions of chapters 616A to
7 616D, inclusive, or chapter 617 of NRS and, notwithstanding the
8 provisions of NRS 616A.020, receive payment from the employer
9 for that injury:
10 (a) The amount of compensation the injured employee or the
11 dependents of the employee are entitled to receive pursuant to the
12 provisions of chapters 616A to 616D, inclusive, or chapter 617 of
13 NRS, including any future compensation, must be reduced by the
14 amount paid by the employer.
15 (b) The insurer, or in the case of claims involving the Uninsured
16 Employers’ Claim Account or a subsequent injury account the
17 Administrator, has a lien upon the total amount paid by the
18 employer if the injured employee or the dependents of the employee
19 receive compensation pursuant to the provisions of chapters 616A to
20 616D, inclusive, or chapter 617 of NRS.
21  This subsection is applicable whether the money paid to the
22 employee or the dependents of the employee by the employer is

– 3 –
1 classified as a gift, a settlement or otherwise. The provisions of this
2 subsection do not grant to an injured employee any right of action in

4 2. When an employee receives an injury for which
5 compensation is payable pursuant to the provisions of chapters
6 616A to 616D, inclusive, or chapter 617 of NRS and which was
7 caused under circumstances creating a legal liability in some person,
8 other than the employer or a person in the same employ, to pay
9 damages in respect thereof:
10 (a) The injured employee, or in case of death the dependents of
11 the employee, may take proceedings against that person to recover

13 or the dependents of the employee are entitled to receive pursuant to
14 the provisions of chapters 616A to 616D, inclusive, or chapter 617
15 of NRS, including any future compensation, must be reduced by the
16 amount of the damages recovered, notwithstanding any act or
17 omission of the employer or a person in the same employ which was
18 a direct or proximate cause of the employee’s injury.
19 (b) If the injured employee, or in case of death the dependents of
20 the employee, receive compensation pursuant to the provisions of
21 chapters 616A to 616D, inclusive, or chapter 617 of NRS, the
22 insurer, or in case of claims involving the Uninsured Employers’
23 Claim Account or a subsequent injury account the Administrator,
24 has a right of action against the person so liable to pay damages and
25 is subrogated to the rights of the injured employee or of the
26 employee’s dependents to recover therefor.

4 The insurer and the Administrator are not subrogated to the rights of
5 an injured employee or the dependents of the employee under a
6 policy of uninsured or underinsured vehicle coverage purchased by
7 the employee.

9 underinsured vehicle coverage which has the effect of:
10 (1) Limiting the rights of the injured employee or the
11 dependents of the employee to recover proceeds under the policy
12 because of the receipt of any compensation pursuant to the
13 provisions of chapters 616A to 616D, inclusive, or chapter 617 of
14 NRS;
15 (2) Limiting the rights of subrogation of the insurer or

6 this subparagraph, “total amount recovered” means the total
7 proceeds described in subsection 5, including, without limitation,
8 any attorney’s fees or costs.
9 (b) Except under circumstances in which the full amount of
10 the lien is recoverable pursuant to subparagraph (1) of paragraph
11 (a), the lien must be reduced by an amount equal to one-half of
12 the reasonable expenses incurred by the injured employee, or in
13 the case of death the dependents of the employee, in prosecuting
14 or settling the claim against a person other than the employer or
15 person in the same employ. The accounting of any such
16 reasonable expenses:
17 (1) Must be verified by a certified public accountant

27 amount of future compensation that the injured employee, or in
28 the case of death the dependents of the employee, is entitled to
29 receive:
30 (1) Such an offset may be applied only against payments of
31 compensation that are not accident benefits; and
32 (2) Each individual payment to which the offset applied
33 must be reduced by not more than one-third of the amount
34 otherwise owed until the total amount of all such reductions
35 equals the total amount recovered, as defined in subparagraph (1)
36 of paragraph (a), less any reductions imposed pursuant to
37 paragraphs (a) and (b).
38 8. An injured employee, or in the case of death the dependents
39 of the employee, or the attorney or representative of the injured
40 employee or the dependents of the employee, shall notify the
41 insurer, or in the case of claims involving the Uninsured Employers’
42 Claim Account or a subsequent injury account the Administrator, in

2 actual receipt of the proceeds of the judgment, settlement or
3 otherwise:
4 (a) The injured employee or the dependents of the employee, or
5 the attorney or representative of the injured employee or the

16 insurer is entitled pursuant to this section if the attorney,
17 representative or third-party insurer has knowledge of the lien
18 provided for in this section.

20 unless the injured employee or the dependents of the employee, or
21 the attorney or representative of the injured employee or the
22 dependents of the employee, refuses to provide to the insurer
23 information concerning the action against the third party.
24 [10.] 11. In any trial of an action by the injured employee, or in
25 the case of his or her death by the dependents of the employee,
26 against a person other than the employer or a person in the same
27 employ, the jury must receive proof of the amount of all payments
28 made or to be made by the insurer or the Administrator. The court
29 shall instruct the jury substantially as follows:
30
31 Payment of workmen’s compensation benefits by the
32 insurer, or in the case of claims involving the Uninsured
33 Employers’ Claim Account or a subsequent injury account
34 the Administrator, is based upon the fact that a compensable
35 industrial accident occurred, and does not depend upon blame
36 or fault. If the plaintiff does not obtain a judgment in his or
37 her favor in this case, the plaintiff is not required to repay his
38 or her employer, the insurer or the Administrator any amount
39 paid to the plaintiff or paid on the behalf of the plaintiff by
40 the plaintiff’s employer, the insurer or the Administrator.
41 If you decide that the plaintiff is entitled to judgment
42 against the defendant, you shall find damages for the plaintiff
43 in accordance with the court’s instructions on damages and
44 return your verdict in the plaintiff’s favor in the amount so
45 found without deducting the amount of any compensation
-

2 by which any compensation benefits will be repaid from your
3 award.

6 account with the private carrier must be credited with an amount
7 equal to that recovered by the private carrier from a third party
8 pursuant to this section, less the private carrier’s share of the
9 expenses of litigation incurred in obtaining the recovery, except that
10 the total credit must not exceed the amount of compensation
11 actually paid or reserved by the private carrier on the injured
12 employee’s claim.
13 [12.] 13. As used in this section, “third-party insurer” means
14 an insurer that issued to a third party who is liable for damages
15 pursuant to subsection 2, a policy of liability insurance the proceeds
16 of which are recoverable pursuant to this section. The term includes
17 an insurer that issued to an employer a policy of uninsured or
18 underinsured vehicle coverage.

20 any:
21 (a) Action or proceeding initiated pursuant to or which is subject
22 to the provisions of NRS 616C.215, as that section existed before

24 in which a final judgment, settlement or other disposition has not
25 been entered by the effective date of this act.
