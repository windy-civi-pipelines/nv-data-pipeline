EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to industrial insurance; revising provisions governing certain civil
actions involving injured employees; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the payment of compensation under industrial insurance if,
2 during the course of employment, an employee is injured or killed by a workplace accident or
3 occupational disease. (Chapters 616A-617 of NRS) Existing law defines the term
4 “compensation” to mean the money which is payable to an employee or to the dependents of
5 the employee as provided in existing law governing industrial insurance, including benefits
6 for funerals, accident benefits or medical benefits and money for rehabilitative services. (NRS
7 616A.090, 617.050)
8 [If the injury of an injured employee was caused under circumstances entitling the
9 employee to recover another payment from the employer for the injury in the form of a gift,
10 settlement or otherwise, existing law requires the amount of compensation to which the
11 injured employee or the dependents of the employee are entitled, including any future
12 compensation, to be reduced by the additional amount paid by the employer. Existing law
13 provides that the industrial insurer or Administrator of the Division of Industrial Relations of
14 the Department of Business and Industry has a lien against the total amount paid by the
15 employer. (NRS 616C.215)]
16 If the injury of an injured employee was caused under circumstances creating legal
17 liability in a person other than the employer or a person in the same employ, [or entitling the
18 employee or the dependents of the employee to receive proceeds under his or her employer’s
19 policy of uninsured or underinsured vehicle coverage,] existing law authorizes an injured
20 employee or the dependents of the employee, under certain circumstances, to take proceedings

Senate Amendment No. 141 to Senate Bill No. 258 Page 4
21 to recover damages from that third party . [or to recover those proceeds under the policy.]
22 Existing law also authorizes the industrial insurer or Administrator, under certain
23 circumstances, to recover damages from that third party . [or recover proceeds under the
24 policy.] Additionally, under existing law, the industrial insurer or Administrator has a lien
25 against the total proceeds of any recovery by the injured employee or the dependents of the
26 employee. Existing law requires the amount of compensation to which the injured employee
27 or the dependents of the employee are entitled, including any future compensation, to be
28 reduced by the amount of damages or proceeds recovered. (NRS 616C.215)
29 This bill [limits] provides that the [reduction of compensation, including future
30 compensation, to a reduction based on the portion of any amount paid or the portion of
31 damages or proceeds recovered which represents economic damages. This bill also provides]
32 maximum amount that the industrial insurer or Administrator [only has] may recover for
33 such a lien [upon] must be the [portion] lesser of [any] : (1) the full amount [paid or] of the
34 [portion of any judgment, settlement] lien; or [otherwise which represents economic damages,
35 instead] (2) one-third of the total amount [paid or the total proceeds] of any recovery [. This
36 bill defines the term “economic damages,” in accordance with provisions of existing law, to
37 mean damages for medical treatment, care or custody, loss of earnings and loss of earning
38 capacity. (NRS 41A.007)] , inclusive of any attorney’s fees or costs.
39 [This bill provides that the injured employee or the dependents of the employee are
40 entitled to be made whole for the injury, and a lien amount is recoverable only if the injured
41 employee or the dependents of the employee have been made whole. This] Except where the
42 full amount of the lien may be recovered, this bill [: (1)] requires [adjustment of] the lien
43 amount to [reflect a proportional share of any] be reduced by an amount equal to one-half
44 of the reasonable expenses incurred by the injured employee or the dependents of the
45 employee in procuring the [payment or] recovery [; (2)] , which must be verified by a
46 certified public accountant and is subject to judicial review under certain circumstances.
47 This bill also limits [the lien] any offset to the amount [to the] of future compensation
48 received by the injured employee or dependents of the employee [;] to: (1) an offset against
49 payments of compensation that are not accident benefits; and [(3) excludes from the lien]
50 (2) a reduction in each such payment which does not exceed one-third of the amount of
51 [any benefit penalty or certain other administrative fines.] the payment until the total
52 amount of all such reductions equals the total amount recovered, less any applicable
53 reductions.
54 [Existing law requires an injured employee or the dependents of the employee, or the
55 attorney or representative of the injured employee or the dependents, to notify the industrial
56 insurer or the Administrator in writing before initiating certain proceedings or actions. (NRS
57 616C.215) This bill removes that requirement. Existing law generally provides that an action
58 to recover damages for an injury or death of a person must be commenced within 2 years.
59 (NRS 11.190) This bill prohibits an industrial insurer or the Administrator from initiating
60 certain proceedings or actions against a person other than the employer or a person in the
61 same employ unless the injured employee or the dependents of the employee has not initiated
62 a proceeding or action within 1 year of the date on which the injury occurred. If the industrial
63 insurer or Administrator initiates such a proceeding or action, this bill: (1) requires the
64 industrial insurer or the Administrator to immediately notify the injured employee or the
65 dependents of the employee, or an attorney or representative of the injured employee or the
66 dependents, of the proceeding or action in writing; and (2) entitles the injured employee or the
67 dependents of the employee to intervene in the proceeding or action.
68 In any trial of certain actions against a person other than the employer or a person in the
69 same employ, existing law requires that the jury must receive: (1) proof of the amount of all
70 payments made or to be made by the insurer or Administrator; and (2) certain instructions
71 from the court. (NRS 616C.215) This bill removes those requirements and instead prohibits
72 the jury from receiving proof of any such payments. This bill provides that evidence of the
73 amount of compensation, accident benefits and other expenditures which the insurer or certain
74 accounts under control of the Administrator have paid or become obligated to pay is not
75 admissible at trial.]

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 616C.215 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 616C.215 1. If an injured employee or, in the event of his or her death, the
3 dependents of the employee, bring an action in tort against his or her employer to
4 recover payment for an injury which is compensable pursuant to the provisions of
5 chapters 616A to 616D, inclusive, or chapter 617 of NRS and, notwithstanding the
6 provisions of NRS 616A.020, receive payment from the employer for that injury:
7 (a) The amount of compensation the injured employee or the dependents of the
8 employee are entitled to receive pursuant to the provisions of chapters 616A to
9 616D, inclusive, or chapter 617 of NRS, including any future compensation, must
10 be reduced by the [portion of any] amount paid by the employer . [which
11 represents economic damages.]
12 (b) The insurer, or in the case of claims involving the Uninsured Employers’
13 Claim Account or a subsequent injury account the Administrator, has a lien upon
14 the total [portion of any] amount paid by the employer [which represents
15 economic damages] if the injured employee or the dependents of the employee
16 receive compensation pursuant to the provisions of chapters 616A to 616D,
17 inclusive, or chapter 617 of NRS.
18  This subsection is applicable whether the money paid to the employee or the
19 dependents of the employee by the employer is classified as a gift, a settlement or
20 otherwise. The provisions of this subsection do not grant to an injured employee
21 any right of action in tort to recover damages from the employer for the injury.
22 2. When an employee receives an injury for which compensation is payable
23 pursuant to the provisions of chapters 616A to 616D, inclusive, or chapter 617 of
24 NRS and which was caused under circumstances creating a legal liability in some
25 person, other than the employer or a person in the same employ, to pay damages in
26 respect thereof:
27 (a) The injured employee, or in case of death the dependents of the employee,
28 may take proceedings against that person to recover damages, but the amount of the
29 compensation the injured employee or the dependents of the employee are entitled
30 to receive pursuant to the provisions of chapters 616A to 616D, inclusive, or
31 chapter 617 of NRS, including any future compensation, must be reduced by the
32 amount [portion] of the damages recovered , [which represents economic
33 damages,] notwithstanding any act or omission of the employer or a person in the
34 same employ which was a direct or proximate cause of the employee’s injury.
35 (b) If the injured employee, or in case of death the dependents of the employee,
36 receive compensation pursuant to the provisions of chapters 616A to 616D,
37 inclusive, or chapter 617 of NRS, the insurer, or in case of claims involving the
38 Uninsured Employers’ Claim Account or a subsequent injury account the
39 Administrator, has a right of action against the person so liable to pay [economic]
40 damages and is subrogated to the rights of the injured employee or of the
41 employee’s dependents to recover therefor. [such economic damages.
42 (c) The injured employee, or in the case of death the dependents of the
43 employee, must initiate any proceeding or action within the applicable statute of
44 limitations. The insurer, or in the case of claims involving the Uninsured
45 Employers’ Claim Account or a subsequent injury account, the Administrator,
46 may not initiate a proceeding or action pursuant to this subsection unless the
47 injured employee, or in the case of death the dependents of the employee, has not
48 initiated a proceeding or action pursuant to this subsection within 1 year after the
49 date on which the injury occurred. If the insurer or Administrator, as applicable,

Senate Amendment No. 141 to Senate Bill No. 258 Page 6
1 initiates a proceeding or action pursuant to this subsection, the insurer or
2 Administrator shall immediately notify the injured employee or the dependents of
3 the employee, or the attorney or representative of the injured employee or the
4 dependents of the employee, of such a proceeding or action in writing. The
5 injured employee or the dependents of the employee are entitled to intervene in
6 the proceeding or action.]
7 3. When an injured employee incurs an injury for which compensation is
8 payable pursuant to the provisions of chapters 616A to 616D, inclusive, or chapter
9 617 of NRS and which was caused under circumstances entitling the employee, or
10 in the case of death the dependents of the employee, to receive proceeds under his
11 or her employer’s policy of uninsured or underinsured vehicle coverage:
12 (a) The injured employee, or in the case of death the dependents of the
13 employee, may take proceedings to recover those proceeds, but the amount of
14 compensation the injured employee or the dependents of the employee are entitled
15 to receive pursuant to the provisions of chapters 616A to 616D, inclusive, or
16 chapter 617 of NRS, including any future compensation, must be reduced by the
17 amount [portion] of proceeds received . [which represents economic damages.]
18 (b) If an injured employee, or in the case of death the dependents of the
19 employee, receive compensation pursuant to the provisions of chapters 616A to
20 616D, inclusive, or chapter 617 of NRS, the insurer, or in the case of claims
21 involving the Uninsured Employers’ Claim Account or a subsequent injury account
22 the Administrator, is subrogated to the rights of the injured employee or the
23 dependents of the employee to recover [the portion of] proceeds [which represents
24 economic damages] under the employer’s policy of uninsured or underinsured
25 vehicle coverage. The insurer and the Administrator are not subrogated to the rights
26 of an injured employee or the dependents of the employee under a policy of
27 uninsured or underinsured vehicle coverage purchased by the employee.
28 (c) Any provision in the employer’s policy of uninsured or underinsured
29 vehicle coverage which has the effect of:
30 (1) Limiting the rights of the injured employee or the dependents of the
31 employee to recover proceeds under the policy because of the receipt of any
32 compensation pursuant to the provisions of chapters 616A to 616D, inclusive, or
33 chapter 617 of NRS;
34 (2) Limiting the rights of subrogation of the insurer or Administrator
35 provided by paragraph (b); or
36 (3) Excluding coverage which inures to the direct or indirect benefit of the
37 insurer or Administrator,
38  is void.
39 4. In any action or proceedings taken by the insurer or the Administrator
40 pursuant to this section , evidence [:
41 (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection 10, evidence] of the amount of
42 compensation, accident benefits and other expenditures which the insurer, the
43 Uninsured Employers’ Claim Account or a subsequent injury account have paid or
44 become obligated to pay by reason of the injury or death of the employee is
45 admissible.
46 [(b)] If in such action or proceedings the insurer or the Administrator recovers
47 more than those [the] amounts , [described in paragraph (a),] the excess must be
48 paid to the injured employee or the dependents of the employee.
49 5. [In] Except as otherwise provided in subsection 7, in any case where the
50 insurer or the Administrator is subrogated to the rights of the injured employee or
51 of the employee’s dependents as provided in subsection 2 or 3, the insurer or the
52 Administrator has a lien upon the total proceeds [portion] of any recovery from
53 some person other than the employer , [which represents economic damages,]

Senate Amendment No. 141 to Senate Bill No. 258 Page 7
1 whether the proceeds of such recovery are by way of judgment, settlement or
2 otherwise. The injured employee, or in the case of his or her death the dependents
3 of the employee, are not entitled to double recovery [be made whole] for the same
4 injury, notwithstanding any act or omission of the employer or a person in the same
5 employ which was a direct or proximate cause of the employee’s injury.
6 6. [The] Except as otherwise provided in subsection 7, the lien provided for
7 pursuant to subsection 1 or 5 includes [:
8 (a) Includes only] the total compensation expenditure incurred by the insurer,
9 the Uninsured Employers’ Claim Account or a subsequent injury account for the
10 injured employee and the dependents of the employee . [;
11 (b) Is recoverable only if the injured employee, or in the case of his or her
12 death the dependents of the employee, has been made whole for the injury; and
13 (c) Must be adjusted to reflect a pro rata share of any expenses incurred by
14 the injured employee or the dependents of the employee in procuring the
15 recovery.]
16 7. For a lien provided for pursuant to subsection 5:
17 (a) The maximum amount which the insurer or Administrator may recover
18 must be the lesser of:
19 (1) The full amount of the lien; or
20 (2) One-third of the total amount recovered from the person other than
21 the employer or person in the same employ. As used in this subparagraph, “total
22 amount recovered” means the total proceeds described in subsection 5, including,
23 without limitation, any attorney’s fees or costs.
24 (b) Except under circumstances in which the full amount of the lien is
25 recoverable pursuant to subparagraph (1) of paragraph (a), the lien must be
26 reduced by an amount equal to one-half of the reasonable expenses incurred by
27 the injured employee, or in the case of death the dependents of the employee, in
28 prosecuting or settling the claim against a person other than the employer or
29 person in the same employ. The accounting of any such reasonable expenses:
30 (1) Must be verified by a certified public accountant certified or licensed
31 to practice in this State or in any other state. The injured employee, the attorney
32 or representative of the injured employee or the dependents of the employee shall
33 provide the verified accounting to the insurer or Administrator.
34 (2) Is subject to judicial review in a court of competent jurisdiction, if a
35 petition is filed within 30 days after the date on which the insurer or
36 Administrator receives a verified accounting pursuant to subparagraph (1).
37 (c) If the insurer or Administrator imposes an offset to the amount of future
38 compensation that the injured employee, or in the case of death the dependents of
39 the employee, is entitled to receive:
40 (1) Such an offset may be applied only against payments of
41 compensation that are not accident benefits; and
42 (2) Each individual payment to which the offset applied must be reduced
43 by not more than one-third of the amount otherwise owed until the total amount
44 of all such reductions equals the total amount recovered, as defined in
45 subparagraph (1) of paragraph (a), less any reductions imposed pursuant to
46 paragraphs (a) and (b).
47 8. An injured employee, or in the case of death the dependents of the
48 employee, or the attorney or representative of the injured employee or the
49 dependents of the employee, shall [may] notify the insurer, or in the case of claims
50 involving the Uninsured Employers’ Claim Account or a subsequent injury account
51 the Administrator, in writing before initiating a proceeding or action pursuant to
52 this section.

Senate Amendment No. 141 to Senate Bill No. 258 Page 8
1 [8.] 9. Within 15 days after the date of recovery by way of actual receipt of
2 the proceeds of the judgment, settlement or otherwise:
3 (a) The injured employee or the dependents of the employee, or the attorney or
4 representative of the injured employee or the dependents of the employee; and
5 (b) The third-party insurer,
6  shall notify the insurer, or in the case of claims involving the Uninsured
7 Employers’ Claim Account or a subsequent injury account the Administrator, of the
8 recovery and pay to the insurer or the Administrator, respectively, the amount due
9 pursuant to this section together with an itemized statement showing the
10 distribution of the total recovery. The attorney or representative of the injured
11 employee or the dependents of the employee and the third-party insurer are jointly
12 and severally liable for any amount to which an insurer is entitled pursuant to this
13 section if the attorney, representative or third-party insurer has knowledge of the
14 lien provided for in this section.
15 [9.] 10. An insurer shall not sell its lien to a third-party insurer unless the
16 injured employee or the dependents of the employee, or the attorney or
17 representative of the injured employee or the dependents of the employee, refuses
18 to provide to the insurer information concerning the action against the third party.
19 [10.] 11. In any trial of an action by the injured employee, or in the case of his
20 or her death by the dependents of the employee, [pursuant to subsection 2] against
21 a person other than the employer or a person in the same employ, [evidence of the
22 amount of compensation, accident benefits and other expenditures which the
23 insurer, the Uninsured Employers’ Claim Account or a subsequent injury
24 account have paid or become obligated to pay is not admissible and] the jury must
25 [not] receive proof of the amount of all [any] payments made or to be made by the
26 [employer,] insurer or the Administrator. The court shall instruct the jury
27 substantially as follows:
28
29 Payment of workmen’s compensation benefits by the insurer, or in the
30 case of claims involving the Uninsured Employers’ Claim Account or a
31 subsequent injury account the Administrator, is based upon the fact that a
32 compensable industrial accident occurred, and does not depend upon blame
33 or fault. If the plaintiff does not obtain a judgment in his or her favor in this
34 case, the plaintiff is not required to repay his or her employer, the insurer or
35 the Administrator any amount paid to the plaintiff or paid on the behalf of
36 the plaintiff by the plaintiff’s employer, the insurer or the Administrator.
37 If you decide that the plaintiff is entitled to judgment against the
38 defendant, you shall find damages for the plaintiff in accordance with the
39 court’s instructions on damages and return your verdict in the plaintiff’s
40 favor in the amount so found without deducting the amount of any
41 compensation benefits paid to or for the plaintiff. The law provides a means
42 by which any compensation benefits will be repaid from your award.
43
44 [11.] 12. To calculate an employer’s premium, the employer’s account with
45 the private carrier must be credited with an amount equal to that recovered by the
46 private carrier from a third party pursuant to this section, less the private carrier’s
47 share of the expenses of litigation incurred in obtaining the recovery, except that the
48 total credit must not exceed the amount of compensation actually paid or reserved
49 by the private carrier on the injured employee’s claim.
50 [12.] 13. As used in this section , “third-party [:
51 (a) “Economic damages” has the meaning ascribed to it in NRS 41A.007.
52 (b) “Third-party] insurer” means an insurer that issued to a third party who is
53 liable for damages pursuant to subsection 2, a policy of liability insurance the

Senate Amendment No. 141 to Senate Bill No. 258 Page 9
1 proceeds of which are recoverable pursuant to this section. The term includes an
2 insurer that issued to an employer a policy of uninsured or underinsured vehicle
3 coverage.
4 [(c) “Total compensation expenditure” means compensation received by an
5 employee or the dependents of the employee. The term does not include a benefit
6 penalty or other administrative fine imposed pursuant to NRS 616D.120.]
7 Sec. 2. 1. The amendatory provisions of this act apply to any:
8 (a) Action or proceeding initiated pursuant to or which is subject to the
9 provisions of NRS 616C.215, as that section existed before the effective date of this
10 act, or as amended by section 1 of this act, in which a final judgment, settlement or
11 other disposition has not been entered by the effective date of this act.
12 (b) Claim for compensation pursuant to chapters 616A to 616D, inclusive, or
13 617 of NRS, which is open on or filed on or after the effective date of this act.
14 2. As used in this section, “compensation” has the meaning ascribed to it in
15 NRS 616A.090 or 617.050, as applicable.
16 Sec. 3. This act becomes effective upon passage and approval.
