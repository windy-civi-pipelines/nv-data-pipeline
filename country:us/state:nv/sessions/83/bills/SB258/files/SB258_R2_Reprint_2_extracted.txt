SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to industrial insurance.
(BDR 53-594)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to industrial insurance; revising provisions
governing certain civil actions involving injured
employees; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the payment of compensation under industrial
2 insurance if, during the course of employment, an employee is injured or killed by a
3 workplace accident or occupational disease. (Chapters 616A-617 of NRS) Existing
4 law defines the term “compensation” to mean the money which is payable to an
5 employee or to the dependents of the employee as provided in existing law
6 governing industrial insurance, including benefits for funerals, accident benefits or
7 medical benefits and money for rehabilitative services. (NRS 616A.090, 617.050)
8 If the injury of an injured employee was caused under circumstances creating
9 legal liability in a person other than the employer or a person in the same employ,
10 existing law authorizes an injured employee or the dependents of the employee,
11 under certain circumstances, to take proceedings to recover damages from that third
-

12 party. Existing law also authorizes the industrial insurer or Administrator of the
13 Division of Industrial Relations of the Department of Business and Industry, under
14 certain circumstances, to recover damages from that third party. Additionally, under
15 existing law, the industrial insurer or Administrator has a lien against the total
16 proceeds of any recovery by the injured employee or the dependents of the
17 employee. Existing law requires the amount of compensation to which the injured
18 employee or the dependents of the employee are entitled, including any future
19 compensation, to be reduced by the amount of damages or proceeds recovered.
20 (NRS 616C.215)
21 This bill provides that the maximum amount that the industrial insurer or
22 Administrator may recover for such a lien must be the lesser of: (1) the amount of
23 the lien, minus an amount equal to one-half of the reasonable costs incurred by the
24 injured employee or the dependents of the employee in procuring the recovery; or
25 (2) one-third of the total amount of any recovery, inclusive of any attorney’s fees or
26 costs and the monetary value of any other property which is recovered, minus an
27 amount equal to one-half of the reasonable costs incurred by the injured employee
28 or the dependents of the employee in procuring the recovery.
29 This bill requires an itemized memorandum of any such reasonable costs
30 incurred by the injured employee or the dependents of the employee in procuring
31 the recovery to be verified by the injured employee, the dependents of the
32 employee or the attorney or representative of the injured employee or the
33 dependents of the employee, provided to the industrial insurer or Administrator and
34 subject to judicial review under certain circumstances. This bill also limits any
35 offset to the amount of future compensation received by the injured employee or
36 dependents of the employee to: (1) an offset against payments of compensation that
37 are not accident benefits; and (2) a reduction in each such payment which does not
38 exceed one-third of the amount of the payment until the total amount of all such
39 reductions equals the net amount recovered by the injured employee or dependents
40 of the employee.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 616C.215 is hereby amended to read as
2 follows:
3 616C.215 1. If an injured employee or, in the event of his or
4 her death, the dependents of the employee, bring an action in tort
5 against his or her employer to recover payment for an injury which
6 is compensable pursuant to the provisions of chapters 616A to
7 616D, inclusive, or chapter 617 of NRS and, notwithstanding the
8 provisions of NRS 616A.020, receive payment from the employer
9 for that injury:
10 (a) The amount of compensation the injured employee or the
11 dependents of the employee are entitled to receive pursuant to the
12 provisions of chapters 616A to 616D, inclusive, or chapter 617 of
13 NRS, including any future compensation, must be reduced by the
14 amount paid by the employer.
15 (b) The insurer, or in the case of claims involving the Uninsured
16 Employers’ Claim Account or a subsequent injury account the
-
*SB258_R2*
– 3 –
1 Administrator, has a lien upon the total amount paid by the
2 employer if the injured employee or the dependents of the employee
3 receive compensation pursuant to the provisions of chapters 616A to
4 616D, inclusive, or chapter 617 of NRS.
5  This subsection is applicable whether the money paid to the
6 employee or the dependents of the employee by the employer is
7 classified as a gift, a settlement or otherwise. The provisions of this
8 subsection do not grant to an injured employee any right of action in
9 tort to recover damages from the employer for the injury.
10 2. When an employee receives an injury for which
11 compensation is payable pursuant to the provisions of chapters
12 616A to 616D, inclusive, or chapter 617 of NRS and which was
13 caused under circumstances creating a legal liability in some person,
14 other than the employer or a person in the same employ, to pay
15 damages in respect thereof:
16 (a) The injured employee, or in case of death the dependents of
17 the employee, may take proceedings against that person to recover
18 damages, but the amount of the compensation the injured employee
19 or the dependents of the employee are entitled to receive pursuant to
20 the provisions of chapters 616A to 616D, inclusive, or chapter 617
21 of NRS, including any future compensation, must be reduced by the
22 amount of the damages recovered, notwithstanding any act or
23 omission of the employer or a person in the same employ which was
24 a direct or proximate cause of the employee’s injury.
25 (b) If the injured employee, or in case of death the dependents of
26 the employee, receive compensation pursuant to the provisions of
27 chapters 616A to 616D, inclusive, or chapter 617 of NRS, the
28 insurer, or in case of claims involving the Uninsured Employers’
29 Claim Account or a subsequent injury account the Administrator,
30 has a right of action against the person so liable to pay damages and
31 is subrogated to the rights of the injured employee or of the
32 employee’s dependents to recover therefor.
33 3. When an injured employee incurs an injury for which
34 compensation is payable pursuant to the provisions of chapters
35 616A to 616D, inclusive, or chapter 617 of NRS and which was
36 caused under circumstances entitling the employee, or in the case of
37 death the dependents of the employee, to receive proceeds under his
38 or her employer’s policy of uninsured or underinsured vehicle
39 coverage:
40 (a) The injured employee, or in the case of death the dependents
41 of the employee, may take proceedings to recover those proceeds,
42 but the amount of compensation the injured employee or the
43 dependents of the employee are entitled to receive pursuant to the
44 provisions of chapters 616A to 616D, inclusive, or chapter 617 of
-
*SB258_R2*
– 4 –
1 NRS, including any future compensation, must be reduced by the
2 amount of proceeds received.
3 (b) If an injured employee, or in the case of death the
4 dependents of the employee, receive compensation pursuant to the
5 provisions of chapters 616A to 616D, inclusive, or chapter 617 of
6 NRS, the insurer, or in the case of claims involving the Uninsured
7 Employers’ Claim Account or a subsequent injury account the
8 Administrator, is subrogated to the rights of the injured employee or
9 the dependents of the employee to recover proceeds under the
10 employer’s policy of uninsured or underinsured vehicle coverage.
11 The insurer and the Administrator are not subrogated to the rights of
12 an injured employee or the dependents of the employee under a
13 policy of uninsured or underinsured vehicle coverage purchased by
14 the employee.
15 (c) Any provision in the employer’s policy of uninsured or
16 underinsured vehicle coverage which has the effect of:
17 (1) Limiting the rights of the injured employee or the
18 dependents of the employee to recover proceeds under the policy
19 because of the receipt of any compensation pursuant to the
20 provisions of chapters 616A to 616D, inclusive, or chapter 617 of
21 NRS;
22 (2) Limiting the rights of subrogation of the insurer or
23 Administrator provided by paragraph (b); or
24 (3) Excluding coverage which inures to the direct or indirect
25 benefit of the insurer or Administrator,
26  is void.
27 4. In any action or proceedings taken by the insurer or the
28 Administrator pursuant to this section, evidence of the amount of
29 compensation, accident benefits and other expenditures which the
30 insurer, the Uninsured Employers’ Claim Account or a subsequent
31 injury account have paid or become obligated to pay by reason of
32 the injury or death of the employee is admissible.
33 If in such action or proceedings the insurer or the Administrator
34 recovers more than those amounts, the excess must be paid to the
35 injured employee or the dependents of the employee.
36 5. [In] Except as otherwise provided in subsection 7, in any
37 case where the insurer or the Administrator is subrogated to the
38 rights of the injured employee or of the employee’s dependents as
39 provided in subsection 2 or 3, the insurer or the Administrator has a
40 lien upon the total proceeds of any recovery from some person other
41 than the employer, whether the proceeds of such recovery are by
42 way of judgment, settlement or otherwise. The injured employee, or
43 in the case of his or her death the dependents of the employee, are
44 not entitled to double recovery for the same injury, notwithstanding
-
*SB258_R2*
– 5 –
1 any act or omission of the employer or a person in the same employ
2 which was a direct or proximate cause of the employee’s injury.
3 6. [The] Except as otherwise provided in subsection 7, the lien
4 provided for pursuant to subsection 1 or 5 includes the total
5 compensation expenditure incurred by the insurer, the Uninsured
6 Employers’ Claim Account or a subsequent injury account for the
7 injured employee and the dependents of the employee.
8 7. For a lien provided for pursuant to subsection 5:
9 (a) The maximum amount which the insurer or Administrator
10 may recover must be the lesser of:
11 (1) The amount of the lien, as reduced pursuant to
12 paragraph (b); or
13 (2) One-third of the total amount recovered from the person
14 other than the employer or person in the same employ, as reduced
15 pursuant to paragraph (b). As used in this subparagraph, “total
16 amount recovered” means the total proceeds described in
17 subsection 5, including, without limitation, any attorney’s fees or
18 costs and the monetary value of any virtual currency, securities,
19 real property, personal property or intellectual property which is
20 part of the judgment, settlement or other means of recovery, as
21 applicable, as calculated on the date on which the judgment,
22 settlement or other document providing for the other means of
23 recovery, as applicable, is executed.
24 (b) The maximum amount which the insurer or Administrator
25 may recover pursuant to paragraph (a) must be reduced by an
26 amount equal to one-half of the reasonable costs incurred by the
27 injured employee, or in the case of death the dependents of the
28 employee, in prosecuting or settling the claim against a person
29 other than the employer or person in the same employ. An
30 itemized memorandum of any such reasonable costs:
31 (1) Must be verified by the injured employee, the
32 dependents of the employee or the attorney or representative of the
33 injured employee or the dependents of the employee and provided
34 to the insurer or Administrator.
35 (2) Is subject to judicial review in a court of competent
36 jurisdiction, if a petition is filed within 30 days after the date on
37 which the insurer or Administrator receives a verified itemized
38 memorandum provided pursuant to subparagraph (1).
39 (c) If the insurer or Administrator imposes an offset to the
40 amount of future compensation that the injured employee, or in
41 the case of death the dependents of the employee, is entitled to
42 receive:
43 (1) Such an offset may be applied only against payments of
44 compensation that are not accident benefits; and
-
*SB258_R2*
– 6 –
1 (2) Each individual payment to which the offset applied
2 must be reduced by not more than one-third of the amount
3 otherwise owed until the total amount of all such reductions
4 equals the net amount recovered by the injured employee, or in the
5 case of death the dependents of the employee, from the person
6 other than the employer or person in the same employ. As used in
7 this subparagraph, “net amount recovered” means an amount
8 equal to the monetary value of the total amount recovered, as
9 defined in subparagraph (2) of paragraph (a), minus:
10 (I) The maximum amount which the insurer or
11 Administrator may recover pursuant to paragraph (a); and
12 (II) The amount of any attorney’s fees.
13 8. An injured employee, or in the case of death the dependents
14 of the employee, or the attorney or representative of the injured
15 employee or the dependents of the employee, shall notify the
16 insurer, or in the case of claims involving the Uninsured Employers’
17 Claim Account or a subsequent injury account the Administrator, in
18 writing before initiating a proceeding or action pursuant to this
19 section.
20 [8.] 9. Within 15 days after the date of recovery by way of
21 actual receipt of the proceeds of the judgment, settlement or
22 otherwise:
23 (a) The injured employee or the dependents of the employee, or
24 the attorney or representative of the injured employee or the
25 dependents of the employee; and
26 (b) The third-party insurer,
27  shall notify the insurer, or in the case of claims involving the
28 Uninsured Employers’ Claim Account or a subsequent injury
29 account the Administrator, of the recovery and pay to the insurer or
30 the Administrator, respectively, the amount due pursuant to this
31 section together with an itemized statement showing the distribution
32 of the total recovery. The attorney or representative of the injured
33 employee or the dependents of the employee and the third-party
34 insurer are jointly and severally liable for any amount to which an
35 insurer is entitled pursuant to this section if the attorney,
36 representative or third-party insurer has knowledge of the lien
37 provided for in this section.
38 [9.] 10. An insurer shall not sell its lien to a third-party insurer
39 unless the injured employee or the dependents of the employee, or
40 the attorney or representative of the injured employee or the
41 dependents of the employee, refuses to provide to the insurer
42 information concerning the action against the third party.
43 [10.] 11. In any trial of an action by the injured employee, or in
44 the case of his or her death by the dependents of the employee,
45 against a person other than the employer or a person in the same
-
*SB258_R2*
– 7 –
1 employ, the jury must receive proof of the amount of all payments
2 made or to be made by the insurer or the Administrator. The court
3 shall instruct the jury substantially as follows:
4
5 Payment of workmen’s compensation benefits by the
6 insurer, or in the case of claims involving the Uninsured
7 Employers’ Claim Account or a subsequent injury account
8 the Administrator, is based upon the fact that a compensable
9 industrial accident occurred, and does not depend upon blame
10 or fault. If the plaintiff does not obtain a judgment in his or
11 her favor in this case, the plaintiff is not required to repay his
12 or her employer, the insurer or the Administrator any amount
13 paid to the plaintiff or paid on the behalf of the plaintiff by
14 the plaintiff’s employer, the insurer or the Administrator.
15 If you decide that the plaintiff is entitled to judgment
16 against the defendant, you shall find damages for the plaintiff
17 in accordance with the court’s instructions on damages and
18 return your verdict in the plaintiff’s favor in the amount so
19 found without deducting the amount of any compensation
20 benefits paid to or for the plaintiff. The law provides a means
21 by which any compensation benefits will be repaid from your
22 award.
23
24 [11.] 12. To calculate an employer’s premium, the employer’s
25 account with the private carrier must be credited with an amount
26 equal to that recovered by the private carrier from a third party
27 pursuant to this section, less the private carrier’s share of the
28 expenses of litigation incurred in obtaining the recovery, except that
29 the total credit must not exceed the amount of compensation
30 actually paid or reserved by the private carrier on the injured
31 employee’s claim.
32 [12.] 13. As used in this section, “third-party insurer” means
33 an insurer that issued to a third party who is liable for damages
34 pursuant to subsection 2, a policy of liability insurance the proceeds
35 of which are recoverable pursuant to this section. The term includes
36 an insurer that issued to an employer a policy of uninsured or
37 underinsured vehicle coverage.
38 Sec. 2. 1. The amendatory provisions of this act apply to
39 any:
40 (a) Action or proceeding initiated pursuant to or which is subject
41 to the provisions of NRS 616C.215, as that section existed before
42 the effective date of this act, or as amended by section 1 of this act,
43 in which a final judgment, settlement or other disposition has not
44 been entered by the effective date of this act.
-
*SB258_R2*
– 8 –
1 (b) Claim for compensation pursuant to chapters 616A to 616D,
2 inclusive, or 617 of NRS, which is open on or filed on or after the
3 effective date of this act.
4 2. As used in this section, “compensation” has the meaning
5 ascribed to it in NRS 616A.090 or 617.050, as applicable.

AN ACT relating to industrial insurance; revising provisions
governing certain civil actions involving injured
employees; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the payment of compensation under industrial
2 insurance if, during the course of employment, an employee is injured or killed by a
3 workplace accident or occupational disease. (Chapters 616A-617 of NRS) Existing
4 law defines the term “compensation” to mean the money which is payable to an
5 employee or to the dependents of the employee as provided in existing law
6 governing industrial insurance, including benefits for funerals, accident benefits or
7 medical benefits and money for rehabilitative services. (NRS 616A.090, 617.050)
8 If the injury of an injured employee was caused under circumstances creating
9 legal liability in a person other than the employer or a person in the same employ,
10 existing law authorizes an injured employee or the dependents of the employee,
11 under certain circumstances, to take proceedings to recover damages from that third

12 party. Existing law also authorizes the industrial insurer or Administrator of the
13 Division of Industrial Relations of the Department of Business and Industry, under
14 certain circumstances, to recover damages from that third party. Additionally, under
15 existing law, the industrial insurer or Administrator has a lien against the total
16 proceeds of any recovery by the injured employee or the dependents of the
17 employee. Existing law requires the amount of compensation to which the injured
18 employee or the dependents of the employee are entitled, including any future
19 compensation, to be reduced by the amount of damages or proceeds recovered.
20 (NRS 616C.215)
21 This bill provides that the maximum amount that the industrial insurer or
22 Administrator may recover for such a lien must be the lesser of: (1) the amount of
23 the lien, minus an amount equal to one-half of the reasonable costs incurred by the
24 injured employee or the dependents of the employee in procuring the recovery; or
25 (2) one-third of the total amount of any recovery, inclusive of any attorney’s fees or
26 costs and the monetary value of any other property which is recovered, minus an
27 amount equal to one-half of the reasonable costs incurred by the injured employee
28 or the dependents of the employee in procuring the recovery.
29 This bill requires an itemized memorandum of any such reasonable costs
30 incurred by the injured employee or the dependents of the employee in procuring
31 the recovery to be verified by the injured employee, the dependents of the
32 employee or the attorney or representative of the injured employee or the
33 dependents of the employee, provided to the industrial insurer or Administrator and
34 subject to judicial review under certain circumstances. This bill also limits any
35 offset to the amount of future compensation received by the injured employee or
36 dependents of the employee to: (1) an offset against payments of compensation that
37 are not accident benefits; and (2) a reduction in each such payment which does not
38 exceed one-third of the amount of the payment until the total amount of all such
39 reductions equals the net amount recovered by the injured employee or dependents
40 of the employee.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 616C.215 is hereby amended to read as
2 follows:
3 616C.215 1. If an injured employee or, in the event of his or
4 her death, the dependents of the employee, bring an action in tort
5 against his or her employer to recover payment for an injury which
6 is compensable pursuant to the provisions of chapters 616A to
7 616D, inclusive, or chapter 617 of NRS and, notwithstanding the
8 provisions of NRS 616A.020, receive payment from the employer
9 for that injury:
10 (a) The amount of compensation the injured employee or the
11 dependents of the employee are entitled to receive pursuant to the
12 provisions of chapters 616A to 616D, inclusive, or chapter 617 of
13 NRS, including any future compensation, must be reduced by the
14 amount paid by the employer.
15 (b) The insurer, or in the case of claims involving the Uninsured
16 Employers’ Claim Account or a subsequent injury account the
-
*SB258_R2*

– 3 –
1 Administrator, has a lien upon the total amount paid by the
2 employer if the injured employee or the dependents of the employee
3 receive compensation pursuant to the provisions of chapters 616A to
4 616D, inclusive, or chapter 617 of NRS.
5  This subsection is applicable whether the money paid to the
6 employee or the dependents of the employee by the employer is
7 classified as a gift, a settlement or otherwise. The provisions of this
8 subsection do not grant to an injured employee any right of action in
9 tort to recover damages from the employer for the injury.
10 2. When an employee receives an injury for which
11 compensation is payable pursuant to the provisions of chapters
12 616A to 616D, inclusive, or chapter 617 of NRS and which was
13 caused under circumstances creating a legal liability in some person,
14 other than the employer or a person in the same employ, to pay
15 damages in respect thereof:
16 (a) The injured employee, or in case of death the dependents of
17 the employee, may take proceedings against that person to recover
18 damages, but the amount of the compensation the injured employee
19 or the dependents of the employee are entitled to receive pursuant to
20 the provisions of chapters 616A to 616D, inclusive, or chapter 617
21 of NRS, including any future compensation, must be reduced by the
22 amount of the damages recovered, notwithstanding any act or
23 omission of the employer or a person in the same employ which was
24 a direct or proximate cause of the employee’s injury.
25 (b) If the injured employee, or in case of death the dependents of
26 the employee, receive compensation pursuant to the provisions of
27 chapters 616A to 616D, inclusive, or chapter 617 of NRS, the
28 insurer, or in case of claims involving the Uninsured Employers’
29 Claim Account or a subsequent injury account the Administrator,
30 has a right of action against the person so liable to pay damages and
31 is subrogated to the rights of the injured employee or of the
32 employee’s dependents to recover therefor.
33 3. When an injured employee incurs an injury for which
34 compensation is payable pursuant to the provisions of chapters
35 616A to 616D, inclusive, or chapter 617 of NRS and which was
36 caused under circumstances entitling the employee, or in the case of
37 death the dependents of the employee, to receive proceeds under his
38 or her employer’s policy of uninsured or underinsured vehicle
39 coverage:
40 (a) The injured employee, or in the case of death the dependents
41 of the employee, may take proceedings to recover those proceeds,
42 but the amount of compensation the injured employee or the
43 dependents of the employee are entitled to receive pursuant to the
44 provisions of chapters 616A to 616D, inclusive, or chapter 617 of
-

4 dependents of the employee, receive compensation pursuant to the
5 provisions of chapters 616A to 616D, inclusive, or chapter 617 of
6 NRS, the insurer, or in the case of claims involving the Uninsured
7 Employers’ Claim Account or a subsequent injury account the
8 Administrator, is subrogated to the rights of the injured employee or
9 the dependents of the employee to recover proceeds under the
10 employer’s policy of uninsured or underinsured vehicle coverage.
11 The insurer and the Administrator are not subrogated to the rights of
12 an injured employee or the dependents of the employee under a
13 policy of uninsured or underinsured vehicle coverage purchased by
14 the employee.
15 (c) Any provision in the employer’s policy of uninsured or
16 underinsured vehicle coverage which has the effect of:
17 (1) Limiting the rights of the injured employee or the
18 dependents of the employee to recover proceeds under the policy

27 4. In any action or proceedings taken by the insurer or the
28 Administrator pursuant to this section, evidence of the amount of
29 compensation, accident benefits and other expenditures which the
30 insurer, the Uninsured Employers’ Claim Account or a subsequent
31 injury account have paid or become obligated to pay by reason of
32 the injury or death of the employee is admissible.
33 If in such action or proceedings the insurer or the Administrator

35 injured employee or the dependents of the employee.
36 5. [In] Except as otherwise provided in subsection 7, in any
37 case where the insurer or the Administrator is subrogated to the
38 rights of the injured employee or of the employee’s dependents as
39 provided in subsection 2 or 3, the insurer or the Administrator has a
40 lien upon the total proceeds of any recovery from some person other
41 than the employer, whether the proceeds of such recovery are by
42 way of judgment, settlement or otherwise. The injured employee, or
43 in the case of his or her death the dependents of the employee, are
44 not entitled to double recovery for the same injury, notwithstanding

5 compensation expenditure incurred by the insurer, the Uninsured
6 Employers’ Claim Account or a subsequent injury account for the
7 injured employee and the dependents of the employee.
8 7. For a lien provided for pursuant to subsection 5:
9 (a) The maximum amount which the insurer or Administrator

12 paragraph (b); or

14 other than the employer or person in the same employ, as reduced
15 pursuant to paragraph (b). As used in this subparagraph, “total
16 amount recovered” means the total proceeds described in
17 subsection 5, including, without limitation, any attorney’s fees or
18 costs and the monetary value of any virtual currency, securities,
19 real property, personal property or intellectual property which is
20 part of the judgment, settlement or other means of recovery, as
21 applicable, as calculated on the date on which the judgment,
22 settlement or other document providing for the other means of
23 recovery, as applicable, is executed.
24 (b) The maximum amount which the insurer or Administrator
25 may recover pursuant to paragraph (a) must be reduced by an
26 amount equal to one-half of the reasonable costs incurred by the
27 injured employee, or in the case of death the dependents of the
28 employee, in prosecuting or settling the claim against a person
29 other than the employer or person in the same employ. An
30 itemized memorandum of any such reasonable costs:
31 (1) Must be verified by the injured employee, the
32 dependents of the employee or the attorney or representative of the
33 injured employee or the dependents of the employee and provided

40 amount of future compensation that the injured employee, or in
41 the case of death the dependents of the employee, is entitled to
42 receive:
43 (1) Such an offset may be applied only against payments of
44 compensation that are not accident benefits; and

3 otherwise owed until the total amount of all such reductions
4 equals the net amount recovered by the injured employee, or in the
5 case of death the dependents of the employee, from the person
6 other than the employer or person in the same employ. As used in
7 this subparagraph, “net amount recovered” means an amount
8 equal to the monetary value of the total amount recovered, as
9 defined in subparagraph (2) of paragraph (a), minus:
10 (I) The maximum amount which the insurer or
11 Administrator may recover pursuant to paragraph (a); and
12 (II) The amount of any attorney’s fees.
13 8. An injured employee, or in the case of death the dependents

17 Claim Account or a subsequent injury account the Administrator, in
18 writing before initiating a proceeding or action pursuant to this
19 section.

21 actual receipt of the proceeds of the judgment, settlement or
22 otherwise:
23 (a) The injured employee or the dependents of the employee, or
24 the attorney or representative of the injured employee or the
25 dependents of the employee; and
26 (b) The third-party insurer,
27  shall notify the insurer, or in the case of claims involving the
28 Uninsured Employers’ Claim Account or a subsequent injury
29 account the Administrator, of the recovery and pay to the insurer or
30 the Administrator, respectively, the amount due pursuant to this
31 section together with an itemized statement showing the distribution
32 of the total recovery. The attorney or representative of the injured
33 employee or the dependents of the employee and the third-party
34 insurer are jointly and severally liable for any amount to which an
35 insurer is entitled pursuant to this section if the attorney,
36 representative or third-party insurer has knowledge of the lien
37 provided for in this section.
38 [9.] 10. An insurer shall not sell its lien to a third-party insurer
39 unless the injured employee or the dependents of the employee, or
40 the attorney or representative of the injured employee or the
41 dependents of the employee, refuses to provide to the insurer
42 information concerning the action against the third party.
43 [10.] 11. In any trial of an action by the injured employee, or in
44 the case of his or her death by the dependents of the employee,
45 against a person other than the employer or a person in the same
-

– 7 –
1 employ, the jury must receive proof of the amount of all payments
2 made or to be made by the insurer or the Administrator. The court
3 shall instruct the jury substantially as follows:
4
5 Payment of workmen’s compensation benefits by the
6 insurer, or in the case of claims involving the Uninsured
7 Employers’ Claim Account or a subsequent injury account
8 the Administrator, is based upon the fact that a compensable
9 industrial accident occurred, and does not depend upon blame
10 or fault. If the plaintiff does not obtain a judgment in his or
11 her favor in this case, the plaintiff is not required to repay his
12 or her employer, the insurer or the Administrator any amount
13 paid to the plaintiff or paid on the behalf of the plaintiff by
14 the plaintiff’s employer, the insurer or the Administrator.
15 If you decide that the plaintiff is entitled to judgment
16 against the defendant, you shall find damages for the plaintiff
17 in accordance with the court’s instructions on damages and
18 return your verdict in the plaintiff’s favor in the amount so
19 found without deducting the amount of any compensation
20 benefits paid to or for the plaintiff. The law provides a means
21 by which any compensation benefits will be repaid from your
22 award.
23
24 [11.] 12. To calculate an employer’s premium, the employer’s
25 account with the private carrier must be credited with an amount
26 equal to that recovered by the private carrier from a third party
27 pursuant to this section, less the private carrier’s share of the
28 expenses of litigation incurred in obtaining the recovery, except that
29 the total credit must not exceed the amount of compensation
30 actually paid or reserved by the private carrier on the injured
31 employee’s claim.
32 [12.] 13. As used in this section, “third-party insurer” means
33 an insurer that issued to a third party who is liable for damages
34 pursuant to subsection 2, a policy of liability insurance the proceeds
35 of which are recoverable pursuant to this section. The term includes
36 an insurer that issued to an employer a policy of uninsured or
37 underinsured vehicle coverage.

39 any:
40 (a) Action or proceeding initiated pursuant to or which is subject
41 to the provisions of NRS 616C.215, as that section existed before
42 the effective date of this act, or as amended by section 1 of this act,
