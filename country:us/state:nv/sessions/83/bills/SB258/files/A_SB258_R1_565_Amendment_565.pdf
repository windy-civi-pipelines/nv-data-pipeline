EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to industrial insurance; revising provisions governing certain civil
actions involving injured employees; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the payment of compensation under industrial insurance if,
2 during the course of employment, an employee is injured or killed by a workplace accident or
3 occupational disease. (Chapters 616A-617 of NRS) Existing law defines the term
4 “compensation” to mean the money which is payable to an employee or to the dependents of
5 the employee as provided in existing law governing industrial insurance, including benefits
6 for funerals, accident benefits or medical benefits and money for rehabilitative services. (NRS
7 616A.090, 617.050)
8 If the injury of an injured employee was caused under circumstances creating legal
9 liability in a person other than the employer or a person in the same employ, existing law
10 authorizes an injured employee or the dependents of the employee, under certain
11 circumstances, to take proceedings to recover damages from that third party. Existing law also
12 authorizes the industrial insurer or Administrator [,] of the Division of Industrial Relations
13 of the Department of Business and Industry, under certain circumstances, to recover
14 damages from that third party. Additionally, under existing law, the industrial insurer or
15 Administrator has a lien against the total proceeds of any recovery by the injured employee or
16 the dependents of the employee. Existing law requires the amount of compensation to which
17 the injured employee or the dependents of the employee are entitled, including any future
18 compensation, to be reduced by the amount of damages or proceeds recovered. (NRS
19 616C.215)

Assembly Amendment No. 565 to Senate Bill No. 258 First Reprint Page 4
20 This bill provides that the maximum amount that the industrial insurer or Administrator
21 may recover for such a lien must be the lesser of: (1) the [full] amount of the lien [;] , minus
22 an amount equal to one-half of the reasonable costs incurred by the injured employee or
23 the dependents of the employee in procuring the recovery; or (2) one-third of the total
24 amount of any recovery, inclusive of any attorney’s fees or costs [.] and the monetary value
25 of any other property which is recovered, minus an amount equal to one-half of the
26 reasonable costs incurred by the injured employee or the dependents of the employee in
27 procuring the recovery.
28 [Except where the full amount of the lien may be recovered, this] This bill requires [the
29 lien amount to be reduced by an amount equal to one-half of the] an itemized memorandum
30 of any such reasonable [expenses] costs incurred by the injured employee or the dependents
31 of the employee in procuring the recovery [, which must] to be verified by [a certified public
32 accountant] the injured employee, the dependents of the employee or the attorney or
33 representative of the injured employee or the dependents of the employee, provided to
34 the industrial insurer or Administrator and [is] subject to judicial review under certain
35 circumstances. This bill also limits any offset to the amount of future compensation received
36 by the injured employee or dependents of the employee to: (1) an offset against payments of
37 compensation that are not accident benefits; and (2) a reduction in each such payment which
38 does not exceed one-third of the amount of the payment until the total amount of all such
39 reductions equals the [total] net amount recovered [, less any applicable reductions.] by the
40 injured employee or dependents of the employee.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 616C.215 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 616C.215 1. If an injured employee or, in the event of his or her death, the
3 dependents of the employee, bring an action in tort against his or her employer to
4 recover payment for an injury which is compensable pursuant to the provisions of
5 chapters 616A to 616D, inclusive, or chapter 617 of NRS and, notwithstanding the
6 provisions of NRS 616A.020, receive payment from the employer for that injury:
7 (a) The amount of compensation the injured employee or the dependents of the
8 employee are entitled to receive pursuant to the provisions of chapters 616A to
9 616D, inclusive, or chapter 617 of NRS, including any future compensation, must
10 be reduced by the amount paid by the employer.
11 (b) The insurer, or in the case of claims involving the Uninsured Employers’
12 Claim Account or a subsequent injury account the Administrator, has a lien upon
13 the total amount paid by the employer if the injured employee or the dependents of
14 the employee receive compensation pursuant to the provisions of chapters 616A to
15 616D, inclusive, or chapter 617 of NRS.
16  This subsection is applicable whether the money paid to the employee or the
17 dependents of the employee by the employer is classified as a gift, a settlement or
18 otherwise. The provisions of this subsection do not grant to an injured employee
19 any right of action in tort to recover damages from the employer for the injury.
20 2. When an employee receives an injury for which compensation is payable
21 pursuant to the provisions of chapters 616A to 616D, inclusive, or chapter 617 of
22 NRS and which was caused under circumstances creating a legal liability in some
23 person, other than the employer or a person in the same employ, to pay damages in
24 respect thereof:
25 (a) The injured employee, or in case of death the dependents of the employee,
26 may take proceedings against that person to recover damages, but the amount of the
27 compensation the injured employee or the dependents of the employee are entitled

Assembly Amendment No. 565 to Senate Bill No. 258 First Reprint Page 5
1 to receive pursuant to the provisions of chapters 616A to 616D, inclusive, or
2 chapter 617 of NRS, including any future compensation, must be reduced by the
3 amount of the damages recovered, notwithstanding any act or omission of the
4 employer or a person in the same employ which was a direct or proximate cause of
5 the employee’s injury.
6 (b) If the injured employee, or in case of death the dependents of the employee,
7 receive compensation pursuant to the provisions of chapters 616A to 616D,
8 inclusive, or chapter 617 of NRS, the insurer, or in case of claims involving the
9 Uninsured Employers’ Claim Account or a subsequent injury account the
10 Administrator, has a right of action against the person so liable to pay damages and
11 is subrogated to the rights of the injured employee or of the employee’s dependents
12 to recover therefor.
13 3. When an injured employee incurs an injury for which compensation is
14 payable pursuant to the provisions of chapters 616A to 616D, inclusive, or chapter
15 617 of NRS and which was caused under circumstances entitling the employee, or
16 in the case of death the dependents of the employee, to receive proceeds under his
17 or her employer’s policy of uninsured or underinsured vehicle coverage:
18 (a) The injured employee, or in the case of death the dependents of the
19 employee, may take proceedings to recover those proceeds, but the amount of
20 compensation the injured employee or the dependents of the employee are entitled
21 to receive pursuant to the provisions of chapters 616A to 616D, inclusive, or
22 chapter 617 of NRS, including any future compensation, must be reduced by the
23 amount of proceeds received.
24 (b) If an injured employee, or in the case of death the dependents of the
25 employee, receive compensation pursuant to the provisions of chapters 616A to
26 616D, inclusive, or chapter 617 of NRS, the insurer, or in the case of claims
27 involving the Uninsured Employers’ Claim Account or a subsequent injury account
28 the Administrator, is subrogated to the rights of the injured employee or the
29 dependents of the employee to recover proceeds under the employer’s policy of
30 uninsured or underinsured vehicle coverage. The insurer and the Administrator are
31 not subrogated to the rights of an injured employee or the dependents of the
32 employee under a policy of uninsured or underinsured vehicle coverage purchased
33 by the employee.
34 (c) Any provision in the employer’s policy of uninsured or underinsured
35 vehicle coverage which has the effect of:
36 (1) Limiting the rights of the injured employee or the dependents of the
37 employee to recover proceeds under the policy because of the receipt of any
38 compensation pursuant to the provisions of chapters 616A to 616D, inclusive, or
39 chapter 617 of NRS;
40 (2) Limiting the rights of subrogation of the insurer or Administrator
41 provided by paragraph (b); or
42 (3) Excluding coverage which inures to the direct or indirect benefit of the
43 insurer or Administrator,
44  is void.
45 4. In any action or proceedings taken by the insurer or the Administrator
46 pursuant to this section, evidence of the amount of compensation, accident benefits
47 and other expenditures which the insurer, the Uninsured Employers’ Claim
48 Account or a subsequent injury account have paid or become obligated to pay by
49 reason of the injury or death of the employee is admissible.
50 If in such action or proceedings the insurer or the Administrator recovers more
51 than those amounts, the excess must be paid to the injured employee or the
52 dependents of the employee.

Assembly Amendment No. 565 to Senate Bill No. 258 First Reprint Page 6
1 5. [In] Except as otherwise provided in subsection 7, in any case where the
2 insurer or the Administrator is subrogated to the rights of the injured employee or
3 of the employee’s dependents as provided in subsection 2 or 3, the insurer or the
4 Administrator has a lien upon the total proceeds of any recovery from some person
5 other than the employer, whether the proceeds of such recovery are by way of
6 judgment, settlement or otherwise. The injured employee, or in the case of his or
7 her death the dependents of the employee, are not entitled to double recovery for
8 the same injury, notwithstanding any act or omission of the employer or a person in
9 the same employ which was a direct or proximate cause of the employee’s injury.
10 6. [The] Except as otherwise provided in subsection 7, the lien provided for
11 pursuant to subsection 1 or 5 includes the total compensation expenditure incurred
12 by the insurer, the Uninsured Employers’ Claim Account or a subsequent injury
13 account for the injured employee and the dependents of the employee.
14 7. For a lien provided for pursuant to subsection 5:
15 (a) The maximum amount which the insurer or Administrator may recover
16 must be the lesser of:
17 (1) The [full] amount of the lien [;] , as reduced pursuant to paragraph
18 (b); or
19 (2) One-third of the total amount recovered from the person other than
20 the employer or person in the same employ [.] , as reduced pursuant to paragraph
21 (b). As used in this subparagraph, “total amount recovered” means the total
22 proceeds described in subsection 5, including, without limitation, any attorney’s
23 fees or costs [.] and the monetary value of any virtual currency, securities, real
24 property, personal property or intellectual property which is part of the judgment,
25 settlement or other means of recovery, as applicable, as calculated on the date on
26 which the judgment, settlement or other document providing for the other means
27 of recovery, as applicable, is executed.
28 (b) [Except under circumstances in which the full] The maximum amount
29 [of] which the [lien is recoverable] insurer or Administrator may recover
30 pursuant to [subparagraph (1) of] paragraph (a) [, the lien] must be reduced by
31 an amount equal to one-half of the reasonable [expenses] costs incurred by the
32 injured employee, or in the case of death the dependents of the employee, in
33 prosecuting or settling the claim against a person other than the employer or
34 person in the same employ. [The accounting] An itemized memorandum of any
35 such reasonable [expenses:] costs:
36 (1) Must be verified by [a certified public accountant certified or licensed
37 to practice in this State or in any other state. The] the injured employee, the
38 dependents of the employee or the attorney or representative of the injured
39 employee or the dependents of the employee [shall provide the verified
40 accounting] and provided to the insurer or Administrator.
41 (2) Is subject to judicial review in a court of competent jurisdiction, if a
42 petition is filed within 30 days after the date on which the insurer or
43 Administrator receives a verified [accounting] itemized memorandum provided
44 pursuant to subparagraph (1).
45 (c) If the insurer or Administrator imposes an offset to the amount of future
46 compensation that the injured employee, or in the case of death the dependents of
47 the employee, is entitled to receive:
48 (1) Such an offset may be applied only against payments of
49 compensation that are not accident benefits; and
50 (2) Each individual payment to which the offset applied must be reduced
51 by not more than one-third of the amount otherwise owed until the total amount
52 of all such reductions equals the [total] net amount recovered [, as defined in
53 subparagraph (1) of paragraph (a), less any reductions imposed] by the injured

Assembly Amendment No. 565 to Senate Bill No. 258 First Reprint Page 7
1 employee, or in the case of death the dependents of the employee, from the person
2 other than the employer or person in the same employ. As used in this
3 subparagraph, “net amount recovered” means an amount equal to the monetary
4 value of the total amount recovered, as defined in subparagraph (2) of paragraph
5 (a), minus:
6 (I) The maximum amount which the insurer or Administrator may
7 recover pursuant to [paragraphs] paragraph (a) ; and [(b).]
8 (II) The amount of any attorney’s fees.
9 8. An injured employee, or in the case of death the dependents of the
10 employee, or the attorney or representative of the injured employee or the
11 dependents of the employee, shall notify the insurer, or in the case of claims
12 involving the Uninsured Employers’ Claim Account or a subsequent injury account
13 the Administrator, in writing before initiating a proceeding or action pursuant to
14 this section.
15 [8.] 9. Within 15 days after the date of recovery by way of actual receipt of
16 the proceeds of the judgment, settlement or otherwise:
17 (a) The injured employee or the dependents of the employee, or the attorney or
18 representative of the injured employee or the dependents of the employee; and
19 (b) The third-party insurer,
20  shall notify the insurer, or in the case of claims involving the Uninsured
21 Employers’ Claim Account or a subsequent injury account the Administrator, of the
22 recovery and pay to the insurer or the Administrator, respectively, the amount due
23 pursuant to this section together with an itemized statement showing the
24 distribution of the total recovery. The attorney or representative of the injured
25 employee or the dependents of the employee and the third-party insurer are jointly
26 and severally liable for any amount to which an insurer is entitled pursuant to this
27 section if the attorney, representative or third-party insurer has knowledge of the
28 lien provided for in this section.
29 [9.] 10. An insurer shall not sell its lien to a third-party insurer unless the
30 injured employee or the dependents of the employee, or the attorney or
31 representative of the injured employee or the dependents of the employee, refuses
32 to provide to the insurer information concerning the action against the third party.
33 [10.] 11. In any trial of an action by the injured employee, or in the case of his
34 or her death by the dependents of the employee, against a person other than the
35 employer or a person in the same employ, the jury must receive proof of the amount
36 of all payments made or to be made by the insurer or the Administrator. The court
37 shall instruct the jury substantially as follows:
38
39 Payment of workmen’s compensation benefits by the insurer, or in the
40 case of claims involving the Uninsured Employers’ Claim Account or a
41 subsequent injury account the Administrator, is based upon the fact that a
42 compensable industrial accident occurred, and does not depend upon blame
43 or fault. If the plaintiff does not obtain a judgment in his or her favor in this
44 case, the plaintiff is not required to repay his or her employer, the insurer or
45 the Administrator any amount paid to the plaintiff or paid on the behalf of
46 the plaintiff by the plaintiff’s employer, the insurer or the Administrator.
47 If you decide that the plaintiff is entitled to judgment against the
48 defendant, you shall find damages for the plaintiff in accordance with the
49 court’s instructions on damages and return your verdict in the plaintiff’s
50 favor in the amount so found without deducting the amount of any
51 compensation benefits paid to or for the plaintiff. The law provides a means
52 by which any compensation benefits will be repaid from your award.

Assembly Amendment No. 565 to Senate Bill No. 258 First Reprint Page 8
1 [11.] 12. To calculate an employer’s premium, the employer’s account with
2 the private carrier must be credited with an amount equal to that recovered by the
3 private carrier from a third party pursuant to this section, less the private carrier’s
4 share of the expenses of litigation incurred in obtaining the recovery, except that the
5 total credit must not exceed the amount of compensation actually paid or reserved
6 by the private carrier on the injured employee’s claim.
7 [12.] 13. As used in this section, “third-party insurer” means an insurer that
8 issued to a third party who is liable for damages pursuant to subsection 2, a policy
9 of liability insurance the proceeds of which are recoverable pursuant to this section.
10 The term includes an insurer that issued to an employer a policy of uninsured or
11 underinsured vehicle coverage.

14 provisions of NRS 616C.215, as that section existed before the effective date of this

16 other disposition has not been entered by the effective date of this act.
