EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public employment; requiring an appointing
authority to recognize relevant employment experience
obtained in the Federal Government as equivalent to
employment experience obtained in the government of
this State for certain purposes; prohibiting, with certain
exceptions, an appointing authority from requiring an
applicant for a position of employment in the classified or
unclassified service of the State to have obtained a
bachelor’s degree as a condition precedent to
employment; requiring the Administrator of the Division
of Human Resource Management of the Department of
Administration to take certain actions with respect to the
master classification plan for all positions in the classified
service of the State; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth various requirements and procedures governing the
2 employment of persons in the classified and unclassified service of this State.
3 (Chapter 284 of NRS) Existing law requires the Administrator of the Division of
4 Human Resource Management of the Department of Administration to prepare,
5 maintain and revise a master classification plan for all positions in the classified
6 service, based on similarity of duties and responsibilities, so that the same
7 qualifications may reasonably be required for, and the same schedule of pay may be
8 equitably applied to, all positions in the same class. (NRS 284.160) Section 4 of
9 this bill requires the Administrator, in determining the qualifications that may be
10 reasonably required for all positions in the same class, to allow a person to
11 substitute equivalent employment experience obtained in the Federal Government
-

– 2 –
12 for any employment experience required to be obtained in the government of this
13 State.
14 Existing law requires an appointing authority, with respect to positions in the
15 classified service of the State, to recruit, evaluate, select, manage and promote
16 employees through open competition on the basis of knowledge, skills and ability
17 and without regard to certain characteristics of an applicant or employee. (NRS
18 284.210) Section 5 of this bill specifies that the requirement applies, without
19 limitation, to the recruitment, evaluation, selection, management and promotion of
20 an employee through the making of any determination that affects the pay of an
21 employee. Sections 2 and 5 of this bill additionally require an appointing authority,
22 with respect to positions in the classified and unclassified service, to recruit,
23 evaluate, select, manage and promote employees, including, without limitation,
24 through the making of any determination that affects the pay of an employee, in a
25 manner which recognizes relevant employment experience obtained by an applicant
26 or employee in the Federal Government as equivalent to employment experience
27 obtained in the government of this State.
28 Section 3 of this bill prohibits, with certain exceptions, an appointing authority
29 from requiring an applicant for a position in the classified or unclassified service to
30 have obtained a bachelor’s degree as a condition precedent to employment. Section
31 3 provides an exception from that prohibition if the appointing authority makes
32 certain determinations. Because section 3 prohibits an appointing authority from
33 requiring an applicant to have obtained a bachelor’s degree except under certain
34 limited circumstances, section 4 eliminates provisions of existing law which
35 require the Administrator to conduct certain periodic reviews of classes of positions
36 in the classified service which require a person to hold a bachelor’s degree.
37 (NRS 284.160)
