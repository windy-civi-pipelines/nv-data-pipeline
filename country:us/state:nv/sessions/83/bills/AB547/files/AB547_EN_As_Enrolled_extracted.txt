Section 1:
Dickman, D’Silva, Gallant, Goulding and Kasama
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to public employment; requiring an appointing
authority to recognize relevant employment experience
obtained in the Federal Government as equivalent to
employment experience obtained in the government of this
State for certain purposes; prohibiting, with certain
exceptions, an appointing authority from requiring an
applicant for a position of employment in the classified or
unclassified service of the State to have obtained a bachelor’s
degree as a condition precedent to employment; requiring the
Administrator of the Division of Human Resource
Management of the Department of Administration to take
certain actions with respect to the master classification plan
for all positions in the classified service of the State; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law sets forth various requirements and procedures governing the
employment of persons in the classified and unclassified service of this State.
(Chapter 284 of NRS) Existing law requires the Administrator of the Division of
Human Resource Management of the Department of Administration to prepare,
maintain and revise a master classification plan for all positions in the classified
service, based on similarity of duties and responsibilities, so that the same
qualifications may reasonably be required for, and the same schedule of pay may be
equitably applied to, all positions in the same class. (NRS 284.160) Section 4 of
this bill requires the Administrator, in determining the qualifications that may be
reasonably required for all positions in the same class, to allow a person to
substitute equivalent employment experience obtained in the Federal Government
for any employment experience required to be obtained in the government of this
State.
Existing law requires an appointing authority, with respect to positions in the
classified service of the State, to recruit, evaluate, select, manage and promote
employees through open competition on the basis of knowledge, skills and ability
and without regard to certain characteristics of an applicant or employee. (NRS

Section 2:
284.210) Section 5 of this bill specifies that the requirement applies, without
limitation, to the recruitment, evaluation, selection, management and promotion of
an employee through the making of any determination that affects the pay of an
employee. Sections 2 and 5 of this bill additionally require an appointing authority,
with respect to positions in the classified and unclassified service, to recruit,
evaluate, select, manage and promote employees, including, without limitation,
through the making of any determination that affects the pay of an employee, in a
manner which recognizes relevant employment experience obtained by an applicant
or employee in the Federal Government as equivalent to employment experience
obtained in the government of this State.

Section 3:
Section 3 of this bill prohibits, with certain exceptions, an appointing authority
from requiring an applicant for a position in the classified or unclassified service
to have obtained a bachelor’s degree as a condition precedent to employment.

Section 4:
Section 3 provides an exception from that prohibition if the appointing authority
makes certain determinations. Because section 3 prohibits an appointing authority
from requiring an applicant to have obtained a bachelor’s degree except under
certain limited circumstances, section 4 eliminates provisions of existing law which
require the Administrator to conduct certain periodic reviews of classes of positions
in the classified service which require a person to hold a bachelor’s degree.
