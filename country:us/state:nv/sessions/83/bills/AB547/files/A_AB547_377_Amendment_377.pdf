EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public employment; requiring an appointing authority to
recognize relevant employment experience obtained in the Federal
Government as equivalent to employment experience obtained in the
government of this State for certain purposes; prohibiting, with certain
exceptions, an appointing authority from requiring an applicant for a
position of employment in the classified or unclassified service of the
State to have obtained a bachelor’s degree as a condition precedent to
employment; requiring the Administrator of the Division of Human
Resource Management of the Department of Administration to take
certain actions with respect to the master classification plan for all
positions in the classified service of the State; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth various requirements and procedures governing the employment of
2 persons in the classified and unclassified service of this State. (Chapter 284 of NRS) Existing
3 law requires the Administrator of the Division of Human Resource Management of the
4 Department of Administration to prepare, maintain and revise a master classification plan for
5 all positions in the classified service, based on similarity of duties and responsibilities, so that
6 the same qualifications may reasonably be required for, and the same schedule of pay may be
7 equitably applied to, all positions in the same class. (NRS 284.160) Section 4 of this bill
8 requires the Administrator, in determining the qualifications that may be reasonably required
9 for all positions in the same class, to allow a person to substitute equivalent employment
10 experience obtained in the Federal Government for any employment experience required to be
11 obtained in the government of this State.
12 Existing law requires an appointing authority, with respect to positions in the classified
13 service of the State, to recruit, evaluate, select, manage and promote employees through open
14 competition on the basis of knowledge, skills and ability and without regard to certain
15 characteristics of an applicant or employee. (NRS 284.210) Section 5 of this bill specifies that
16 the requirement applies, without limitation, to the recruitment, evaluation, selection,
17 management and promotion of an employee through the making of any determination that
18 affects the pay of an employee. Sections 2 and 5 of this bill additionally require an appointing
19 authority, with respect to positions in the classified and unclassified service, to recruit,
20 evaluate, select, manage and promote employees, including, without limitation, through the

Assembly Amendment No. 377 to Assembly Bill No. 547 Page 4
21 making of any determination that affects the pay of an employee, in a manner which
22 recognizes relevant employment experience obtained by an applicant or employee in the
23 Federal Government as equivalent to employment experience obtained in the government of
24 this State.
25 Section 3 of this bill prohibits, with certain exceptions, an appointing authority from
26 requiring an applicant for a position in the classified or unclassified service to have obtained a
27 bachelor’s degree as a condition precedent to employment. Section 3 provides an exception
28 from that prohibition if the appointing authority makes certain determinations. Because
29 section 3 prohibits an appointing authority from requiring an applicant to have obtained a
30 bachelor’s degree except under certain limited circumstances, section 4 eliminates provisions
31 of existing law which require the Administrator to conduct certain periodic reviews of classes
32 of positions in the classified service which require a person to hold a bachelor’s degree. (NRS
33 284.160)
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN

4 authority shall recruit, evaluate, select, manage and promote employees,
5 including, without limitation, through the making of any determination that

7 employment experience obtained by an applicant or employee in the Federal
8 Government as equivalent to employment experience obtained in the government
9 of this State.
10 Sec. 3. 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2, an appointing
11 authority shall not require an applicant for a position of employment in the

13 as a condition precedent to employment.
14 2. The provisions of subsection 1 do not apply if the appointing authority

16 which the applicant is applying may only be obtained through a course of study
17 in pursuit of and that culminates in the award of a bachelor’s degree.
18 Sec. 4. NRS 284.160 is hereby amended to read as follows:

22 may reasonably be required for, and the same schedule of pay may be equitably
23 applied to, all positions in the same class.
24 2. In determining the qualifications that may be reasonably required for all
25 positions in the same class pursuant to subsection 1, the Administrator shall
26 [periodically review each class of positions in the classified service which require a
27 person to hold a bachelor’s degree and, whenever the Administrator deems it
28 necessary for the efficiency of the public service, revise the qualifications to] allow
29 a person to substitute equivalent employment experience [or skills in lieu of a
30 bachelor’s degree.] obtained in the Federal Government for any employment
31 experience required to be obtained in the government of this State.
32 3. The Administrator shall review annually the classification plan of each
33 appointing authority using the audit function developed and implemented pursuant

3 positions within its agency whenever the appointing authority deems it necessary
4 for the efficiency of the public service.
5 5. The classification plan and changes therein are subject to approval by the
6 Commission, except that the Administrator, at the request of an appointing

8 of the Commission if:

34 including, without limitation, through the making of any determination that

36 1. Through open competition on the basis of knowledge, skills and ability
37 and without regard to an applicant’s or employee’s religious or political opinions or
38 affiliations, race, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age or
39 disability.
40 2. In a manner which recognizes relevant employment experience obtained
41 by an applicant or employee in the Federal Government as equivalent to
