AN ACT relating to the state militia; revising the benefits and
compensation that a member of the state militia and the
dependents of the member are entitled to receive if the
member is wounded, injured, disabled or killed while on
state active duty; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes that the militia of the State is composed of the Nevada
2 National Guard and, when called into active service by the Governor, reservists to the
3 Nevada National Guard and any volunteer military organizations licensed by the
4 Governor. (NRS 412.026) Existing law entitles, with certain exceptions, any member
5 of the militia of the State or his or her dependents to certain compensation pursuant to
6 the Nevada Industrial Insurance Act or the Nevada Occupational Diseases Act if the
7 member is wounded, injured, disabled or killed while in the line of duty in the service
8 of the State. (NRS 412.142) Existing law further requires that certain compensation
9 and benefits: (1) must be determined based on the member’s average income from all
10 sources during the year immediately preceding his or her injury or death or the
11 commencement of his or her disability; and (2) must not exceed the maximum
12 amount prescribed by the Nevada Industrial Insurance Act or the Nevada
13 Occupational Diseases Act. (NRS 412.142) Section 1 of this bill provides instead that
14 the member or the dependents of the member are entitled to receive compensation and
15 benefits that are equivalent to the federal compensation or benefits that the member
16 would be entitled to receive if the wound, injury, disability or death arose from
17 military duties performed pursuant to Title 10 or Title 32 of the United States Code.
