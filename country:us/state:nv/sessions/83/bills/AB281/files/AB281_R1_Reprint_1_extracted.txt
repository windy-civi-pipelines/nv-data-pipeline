8 of the State. (NRS 412.142) Existing law further requires that certain compensation
9 and benefits: (1) must be determined based on the member’s average income from all
10 sources during the year immediately preceding his or her injury or death or the
11 commencement of his or her disability; and (2) must not exceed the maximum
12 amount prescribed by the Nevada Industrial Insurance Act or the Nevada
13 Occupational Diseases Act. (NRS 412.142) Sections 1 and 2 of this bill clarify that
