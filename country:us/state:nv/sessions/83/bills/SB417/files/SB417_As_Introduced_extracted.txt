AN ACT relating to natural gas utilities; requiring the Public
Utilities Commission of Nevada to adopt regulations
governing the filing of an application for the
establishment of an alternative rate-making plan by a
natural gas utility; setting forth certain requirements for
the submission and approval of such an alternative rate-
making plan; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth certain procedures for a public utility to make changes to
2 a general rate schedule by applying to Public Utilities Commission of Nevada.
3 (NRS 704.100, 704.110) Section 11 of this bill requires the Commission to adopt
4 regulations establishing procedures for a natural gas utility to apply to the
5 Commission for the approval of an alternative rate-making plan, which establishes
6 the alternative rate-making mechanisms that the natural gas utility is authorized to
7 use to set rates during the time period of the plan. The regulations adopted by the
8 Commission must: (1) establish the alternative rate-making mechanisms that may
9 be included in a plan and any limitations on such alternative rate-making
10 mechanisms; (2) prescribe the information that must be included in an alternative
11 rate-making plan and an application for the approval of such a plan; (3) specify the
12 circumstances under which a natural gas utility for which an alternative rate-
13 making plan has been approved must file a general rate application; (4) provide a
14 process to educate customers of a natural gas utility regarding alternative rate-
15 making mechanisms; (5) require a natural gas utility for which an alternative rate-
16 making plan has been approved to keep certain records; and (6) establish criteria for
17 the evaluation of an alternative rate-making plan.
18 Section 12 of this bill authorizes a natural gas utility to submit an application to
19 establish an alternative rate-making plan pursuant to the regulations adopted by the
-

– 2 –
20 Commission, establishes time limits for the Commission to approve or deny such
21 an application and requires the Commission to conduct a consumer session before
22 taking action on such an application. Section 12 requires an application for the
23 approval of an alternative rate-making plan to include a plan to educate the
24 customers of the natural gas utility regarding the alternative rate-making
25 mechanisms in the plan proposed by the utility. Section 12 prohibits the
26 Commission from approving an alternative rate-making plan unless the
27 Commission determines that the plan meets certain requirements. Section 12 also
28 authorizes an alternative rate-making plan to include certain provisions, including,
29 without limitation, a mechanism for earnings-sharing with the customers of the
30 utility. If an alternative rate-making plan includes a formula rate, section 12
31 authorizes the Commission to make certain considerations when determining
32 whether to approve the alternative rate-making plan, which include whether the
33 plan includes: (1) the recovery of the cost of certain capital expenditures; and (2) an
34 annual attrition adjustment. Finally, section 12 authorizes the Commission to
35 investigate and change rates, tolls, charges, rules, regulations, practices and services
36 relating to an alternative rate-making plan under certain circumstances. Section 13
37 of this bill provides that the provisions of this bill do not limit the existing rate-
38 making authority of the Commission.
39 Sections 3-10 of this bill define certain terms relating to alternative rate-making
40 plans.
41 Sections 14 and 15 of this bill create exceptions from the procedure set forth in
42 existing law to change a general rate schedule to authorize a natural gas utility
43 to file an application to establish an alternative rate-making plan pursuant to
44 section 12.

5 (1) The public utility may file the proposed change with the
6 Commission using a letter of advice in lieu of filing an application;
7 and
8 (2) The Commission shall determine whether it should
9 dispense with a hearing regarding the proposed change.
10  A letter of advice filed pursuant to this paragraph must include a

30 3. As used in this section, “electric utility” has the meaning
31 ascribed to it in NRS 704.187.
32 Sec. 15. NRS 704.110 is hereby amended to read as follows:
33 704.110 Except as otherwise provided in NRS 704.075,
34 704.68861 to 704.68887, inclusive, and 704.7865, or as may

38 make changes in any schedule, including, without limitation,
39 changes that will result in a discontinuance, modification or
40 restriction of service, the Commission shall investigate the propriety
41 of the proposed changes to determine whether to approve or
42 disapprove the proposed changes. If an electric utility files such an
43 application and the application is a general rate application or an
44 annual deferred energy accounting adjustment application, the
45 Consumer’s Advocate shall be deemed a party of record.

*SB417*
– 9 –
1 2. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3, if a public
2 utility files with the Commission an application to make changes in
3 any schedule, the Commission shall, not later than 210 days after the
4 date on which the application is filed, issue a written order
5 approving or disapproving, in whole or in part, the proposed
6 changes.
7 3. If a public utility files with the Commission a general rate
8 application, the public utility shall submit with its application a
9 statement showing the recorded results of revenues, expenses,
10 investments and costs of capital for its most recent 12 months for
11 which data were available when the application was prepared.
12 Except as otherwise provided in subsection 4, in determining
13 whether to approve or disapprove any increased rates, the
14 Commission shall consider evidence in support of the increased
15 rates based upon actual recorded results of operations for the same
16 12 months, adjusted for increased revenues, any increased
17 investment in facilities, increased expenses for depreciation, certain
18 other operating expenses as approved by the Commission and
19 changes in the costs of securities which are known and are
20 measurable with reasonable accuracy at the time of filing and which
21 will become effective within 6 months after the last month of those
22 12 months, but the public utility shall not place into effect any
23 increased rates until the changes have been experienced and
24 certified by the public utility to the Commission and the
25 Commission has approved the increased rates. The Commission
26 shall also consider evidence supporting expenses for depreciation,
27 calculated on an annual basis, applicable to major components of the
28 public utility’s plant placed into service during the recorded test
29 period or the period for certification as set forth in the application.
30 Adjustments to revenues, operating expenses and costs of securities
31 must be calculated on an annual basis. Within 90 days after the date
32 on which the certification required by this subsection is filed with
33 the Commission, or within the period set forth in subsection 2,
34 whichever time is longer, the Commission shall make such order in
35 reference to the increased rates as is required by this chapter. The
36 following public utilities shall each file a general rate application
37 pursuant to this subsection based on the following schedule:
38 (a) An electric utility that primarily serves less densely
39 populated counties shall file a general rate application:
40 (1) Not later than 5 p.m. on or before the first Monday in
41 June 2019; and
42 (2) At least once every 36 months thereafter or on a date
43 specified in an alternative rate-making plan approved by the
44 Commission pursuant to NRS 704.7621.

1 (b) An electric utility that primarily serves densely populated
2 counties shall file a general rate application:
3 (1) Not later than 5 p.m. on or before the first Monday in
4 June 2020; and
5 (2) At least once every 36 months thereafter or on a date
6 specified in an alternative rate-making plan approved by the
7 Commission pursuant to NRS 704.7621.
8 (c) A public utility that furnishes water for municipal, industrial
9 or domestic purposes or services for the disposal of sewage, or both,
10 which had an annual gross operating revenue of $2,000,000 or more
11 for at least 1 year during the immediately preceding 3 years and
12 which had not filed a general rate application with the Commission
13 on or after July 1, 2005, shall file a general rate application on or
14 before June 30, 2008, and at least once every 36 months thereafter
15 unless waived by the Commission pursuant to standards adopted by
16 regulation of the Commission. If a public utility furnishes both
17 water and services for the disposal of sewage, its annual gross
18 operating revenue for each service must be considered separately for
19 determining whether the public utility meets the requirements of this
20 paragraph for either service.
21 (d) A public utility that furnishes water for municipal, industrial
22 or domestic purposes or services for the disposal of sewage, or both,
23 which had an annual gross operating revenue of $2,000,000 or more
24 for at least 1 year during the immediately preceding 3 years and
25 which had filed a general rate application with the Commission on
26 or after July 1, 2005, shall file a general rate application on or before
27 June 30, 2009, and at least once every 36 months thereafter unless
28 waived by the Commission pursuant to standards adopted by
29 regulation of the Commission. If a public utility furnishes both
30 water and services for the disposal of sewage, its annual gross
31 operating revenue for each service must be considered separately for
32 determining whether the public utility meets the requirements of this
33 paragraph for either service.
34  The Commission shall adopt regulations setting forth standards
35 for waivers pursuant to paragraphs (c) and (d) and for including the
36 costs incurred by the public utility in preparing and presenting the
37 general rate application before the effective date of any change in
38 rates.
39 4. In addition to submitting the statement required pursuant to
40 subsection 3, a public utility may submit with its general rate
41 application a statement showing the effects, on an annualized basis,
42 of all expected changes in circumstances. If such a statement is
43 filed, it must include all increases and decreases in revenue and
44 expenses which may occur within 210 days after the date on which
45 its general rate application is filed with the Commission if such
-
*SB417*
– 11 –
1 expected changes in circumstances are reasonably known and are
2 measurable with reasonable accuracy. If a public utility submits
3 such a statement, the public utility has the burden of proving that the
4 expected changes in circumstances set forth in the statement are
5 reasonably known and are measurable with reasonable accuracy.
6 The Commission shall consider expected changes in circumstances
7 to be reasonably known and measurable with reasonable accuracy if
8 the expected changes in circumstances consist of specific and
9 identifiable events or programs rather than general trends, patterns
10 or developments, have an objectively high probability of occurring
11 to the degree, in the amount and at the time expected, are primarily
12 measurable by recorded or verifiable revenues and expenses and are
13 easily and objectively calculated, with the calculation of the
14 expected changes relying only secondarily on estimates, forecasts,
15 projections or budgets. If the Commission determines that the public
16 utility has met its burden of proof:
17 (a) The Commission shall consider the statement submitted
18 pursuant to this subsection and evidence relevant to the statement,
19 including all reasonable projected or forecasted offsets in revenue
20 and expenses that are directly attributable to or associated with the
21 expected changes in circumstances under consideration, in addition
22 to the statement required pursuant to subsection 3 as evidence in
23 establishing just and reasonable rates for the public utility; and
24 (b) The public utility is not required to file with the Commission
25 the certification that would otherwise be required pursuant to
26 subsection 3.
27 5. If a public utility files with the Commission an application to
28 make changes in any schedule and the Commission does not issue a
29 final written order regarding the proposed changes within the time
30 required by this section, the proposed changes shall be deemed to be
31 approved by the Commission.
32 6. If a public utility files with the Commission a general rate
33 application, the public utility, or a public utility affiliated with the
34 public utility through common ownership, shall not file with the
35 Commission another general rate application until all pending
36 general rate applications filed by that public utility have been
37 decided by the Commission unless, after application and hearing,
38 the Commission determines that a substantial financial emergency
39 would exist if the public utility or its affiliate is not permitted to file
40 another general rate application sooner. The provisions of this
41 subsection do not prohibit a public utility from filing with the
42 Commission, while a general rate application is pending, an
43 application to recover the increased cost of purchased fuel,
44 purchased power, or natural gas purchased for resale pursuant to
45 subsection 7, a quarterly rate adjustment pursuant to subsection 8 or
-
*SB417*
– 12 –
1 10, any information relating to deferred accounting requirements
2 pursuant to NRS 704.185 or an annual deferred energy accounting
3 adjustment application pursuant to NRS 704.187, if the public utility
4 is otherwise authorized to so file by those provisions.
5 7. A public utility may file an application to recover the
6 increased cost of purchased fuel, purchased power, or natural gas
7 purchased for resale once every 30 days. The provisions of this
8 subsection do not apply to:
9 (a) An electric utility which is required to adjust its rates on a
10 quarterly basis pursuant to subsection 10; or
11 (b) A public utility which purchases natural gas for resale and
12 which adjusts its rates on a quarterly basis pursuant to subsection 8.
13 8. A public utility which purchases natural gas for resale must
14 request approval from the Commission to adjust its rates on a
15 quarterly basis between annual rate adjustment applications based
16 on changes in the public utility’s recorded costs of natural gas
17 purchased for resale. A public utility which purchases natural gas
18 for resale and which adjusts its rates on a quarterly basis may
19 request approval from the Commission to make quarterly
20 adjustments to its deferred energy accounting adjustment. The
21 Commission shall approve or deny such a request not later than 120
22 days after the application is filed with the Commission. The
23 Commission may approve the request if the Commission finds that
24 approval of the request is in the public interest. If the Commission
25 approves a request to make quarterly adjustments to the deferred
26 energy accounting adjustment of a public utility pursuant to this
27 subsection, any quarterly adjustment to the deferred energy
28 accounting adjustment must not exceed 2.5 cents per therm of
29 natural gas. If the balance of the public utility’s deferred account
30 varies by less than 5 percent from the public utility’s annual
31 recorded costs of natural gas which are used to calculate quarterly
32 rate adjustments, the deferred energy accounting adjustment must be
33 set to zero cents per therm of natural gas.
34 9. If the Commission approves a request to make any rate
35 adjustments on a quarterly basis pursuant to subsection 8:
36 (a) The public utility shall file written notice with the
37 Commission before the public utility makes a quarterly rate
38 adjustment. A quarterly rate adjustment is not subject to the
39 requirements for notice and a hearing pursuant to NRS 703.320 or
40 the requirements for a consumer session pursuant to subsection 1 of
41 NRS 704.069.
42 (b) The public utility shall provide written notice of each
43 quarterly rate adjustment to its customers by including the written
44 notice with a customer’s regular monthly bill or by electronic
45 transmission pursuant to NRS 704.188. The public utility shall
-
*SB417*
– 13 –
1 begin providing such written notice to its customers not later than 30
2 days after the date on which the public utility files its written notice
3 with the Commission pursuant to paragraph (a). The written notice
4 required by this paragraph:
5 (1) Must be printed separately, if included with the
6 customer’s regular monthly bill, or the subject line of the electronic
7 transmission must indicate that notice of a quarterly rate adjustment
8 is included, if provided by electronic transmission pursuant to NRS
9 704.188; and
10 (2) Must include the following in clear and bold text:
11 (I) The total amount of the increase or decrease in the
12 public utility’s revenues from the rate adjustment, stated in dollars
13 and as a percentage;
14 (II) The amount of the monthly increase or decrease in
15 charges for each class of customer or class of service, stated in
16 dollars and as a percentage;
17 (III) A statement that customers may send written
18 comments or protests regarding the rate adjustment to the
19 Commission;
20 (IV) A statement that the transactions and recorded costs
21 of natural gas which are the basis for any quarterly rate adjustment
22 will be reviewed for reasonableness and prudence in the next
23 proceeding held by the Commission to review the annual rate
24 adjustment application pursuant to paragraph (d); and
25 (V) Any other information required by the Commission.
26 (c) The public utility shall file an annual rate adjustment
27 application with the Commission. The annual rate adjustment
28 application is subject to the requirements for notice and a hearing
29 pursuant to NRS 703.320 and the requirements for a consumer
30 session pursuant to subsection 1 of NRS 704.069.
31 (d) The proceeding regarding the annual rate adjustment
32 application must include a review of each quarterly rate adjustment
33 and the transactions and recorded costs of natural gas included in
34 each quarterly filing and the annual rate adjustment application.
35 There is no presumption of reasonableness or prudence for any
36 quarterly rate adjustment or for any transactions or recorded costs of
37 natural gas included in any quarterly rate adjustment or the annual
38 rate adjustment application, and the public utility has the burden of
39 proving reasonableness and prudence in the proceeding.
40 (e) The Commission shall not allow the public utility to recover
41 any recorded costs of natural gas which were the result of any
42 practice or transaction that was unreasonable or was undertaken,
43 managed or performed imprudently by the public utility, and the
44 Commission shall order the public utility to adjust its rates if the
45 Commission determines that any recorded costs of natural gas
-
*SB417*
– 14 –
1 included in any quarterly rate adjustment or the annual rate
2 adjustment application were not reasonable or prudent.
3 10. An electric utility shall adjust its rates on a quarterly basis
4 based on changes in the electric utility’s recorded costs of purchased
5 fuel or purchased power. In addition to adjusting its rates on a
6 quarterly basis, an electric utility may request approval from the
7 Commission to make quarterly adjustments to its deferred energy
8 accounting adjustment. The Commission shall approve or deny such
9 a request not later than 120 days after the application is filed with
10 the Commission. The Commission may approve the request if the
11 Commission finds that approval of the request is in the public
12 interest. If the Commission approves a request to make quarterly
13 adjustments to the deferred energy accounting adjustment of an
14 electric utility pursuant to this subsection, any quarterly adjustment
15 to the deferred energy accounting adjustment must not exceed 0.25
16 cents per kilowatt-hour of electricity. If the balance of the electric
17 utility’s deferred account varies by less than 5 percent from the
18 electric utility’s annual recorded costs for purchased fuel or
19 purchased power which are used to calculate quarterly rate
20 adjustments, the deferred energy accounting adjustment must be set
21 to zero cents per kilowatt-hour of electricity.
22 11. A quarterly rate adjustment filed pursuant to subsection 10
23 is subject to the following requirements:
24 (a) The electric utility shall file written notice with the
25 Commission on or before August 15, 2007, and every quarter
26 thereafter of the quarterly rate adjustment to be made by the electric
27 utility for the following quarter. The first quarterly rate adjustment
28 by the electric utility will take effect on October 1, 2007, and each
29 subsequent quarterly rate adjustment will take effect every quarter
30 thereafter. The first quarterly adjustment to a deferred energy
31 accounting adjustment must be made pursuant to an order issued by
32 the Commission approving the application of an electric utility to
33 make quarterly adjustments to its deferred energy accounting
34 adjustment. A quarterly rate adjustment is not subject to the
35 requirements for notice and a hearing pursuant to NRS 703.320 or
36 the requirements for a consumer session pursuant to subsection 1 of
37 NRS 704.069.
38 (b) The electric utility shall provide written notice of each
39 quarterly rate adjustment to its customers by including the written
40 notice with a customer’s regular monthly bill or by electronic
41 submission pursuant to NRS 704.188. The electric utility shall begin
42 providing such written notice to its customers not later than 30 days
43 after the date on which the electric utility files a written notice with
44 the Commission pursuant to paragraph (a). The written notice
45 required by this paragraph:
-
*SB417*
– 15 –
1 (1) Must be printed separately, if included with the
2 customer’s regular monthly bill, or the subject line of the electronic
3 transmission must indicate that notice of a quarterly rate adjustment
4 is included, if provided by electronic transmission pursuant to NRS
5 704.188; and
6 (2) Must include the following in clear and bold text:
7 (I) The total amount of the increase or decrease in the
8 electric utility’s revenues from the rate adjustment, stated in dollars
9 and as a percentage;
10 (II) The amount of the monthly increase or decrease in
11 charges for each class of customer or class of service, stated in
12 dollars and as a percentage;
13 (III) A statement that customers may send written
14 comments or protests regarding the rate adjustment to the
15 Commission;
16 (IV) A statement that the transactions and recorded costs
17 of purchased fuel or purchased power which are the basis for any
18 quarterly rate adjustment will be reviewed for reasonableness and
19 prudence in the next proceeding held by the Commission to review
20 the annual deferred energy accounting adjustment application
21 pursuant to paragraph (d); and
22 (V) Any other information required by the Commission.
23 (c) The electric utility shall file an annual deferred energy
24 accounting adjustment application pursuant to NRS 704.187 with
25 the Commission. The annual deferred energy accounting adjustment
26 application is subject to the requirements for notice and a hearing
27 pursuant to NRS 703.320 and the requirements for a consumer
28 session pursuant to subsection 1 of NRS 704.069.
29 (d) The proceeding regarding the annual deferred energy
30 accounting adjustment application must include a review of each
31 quarterly rate adjustment and the transactions and recorded costs of
32 purchased fuel and purchased power included in each quarterly
33 filing and the annual deferred energy accounting adjustment
34 application. There is no presumption of reasonableness or prudence
35 for any quarterly rate adjustment or for any transactions or recorded
36 costs of purchased fuel and purchased power included in any
37 quarterly rate adjustment or the annual deferred energy accounting
38 adjustment application, and the electric utility has the burden of
39 proving reasonableness and prudence in the proceeding.
40 (e) The Commission shall not allow the electric utility to recover
41 any recorded costs of purchased fuel and purchased power which
42 were the result of any practice or transaction that was unreasonable
43 or was undertaken, managed or performed imprudently by the
44 electric utility, and the Commission shall order the electric utility to
45 adjust its rates if the Commission determines that any recorded costs
-
*SB417*
– 16 –
1 of purchased fuel and purchased power included in any quarterly
2 rate adjustment or the annual deferred energy accounting adjustment
3 application were not reasonable or prudent.
4 12. If an electric utility files an annual deferred energy
5 accounting adjustment application pursuant to subsection 11 and
6 NRS 704.187 while a general rate application is pending, the
7 electric utility shall:
8 (a) Submit with its annual deferred energy accounting
9 adjustment application information relating to the cost of service
10 and rate design; and
11 (b) Supplement its general rate application with the same
12 information, if such information was not submitted with the general
13 rate application.
14 13. A utility facility identified in a 3-year plan submitted
15 pursuant to NRS 704.741 and accepted by the Commission for
16 acquisition or construction pursuant to NRS 704.751 and the
17 regulations adopted pursuant thereto, or the retirement or
18 elimination of a utility facility identified in an emissions reduction
19 and capacity replacement plan submitted pursuant to NRS 704.7316
20 and accepted by the Commission for retirement or elimination
21 pursuant to NRS 704.751 and the regulations adopted pursuant
22 thereto, shall be deemed to be a prudent investment. The utility may
23 recover all just and reasonable costs of planning and constructing, or
24 retiring or eliminating, as applicable, such a facility. For the
25 purposes of this subsection, a plan or an amendment to a plan shall
26 be deemed to be accepted by the Commission only as to that portion
27 of the plan or amendment accepted as filed or modified with the
28 consent of the utility pursuant to NRS 704.751.
29 14. In regard to any rate or schedule approved or disapproved
30 pursuant to this section, the Commission may, after a hearing:
31 (a) Upon the request of the utility, approve a new rate but delay
32 the implementation of that new rate:
33 (1) Until a date determined by the Commission; and
34 (2) Under conditions as determined by the Commission,
35 including, without limitation, a requirement that interest charges be
36 included in the collection of the new rate; and
37 (b) Authorize a utility to implement a reduced rate for low-
38 income residential customers.
39 15. The Commission may, upon request and for good cause
40 shown, permit a public utility which purchases natural gas for resale
41 or an electric utility to make a quarterly adjustment to its deferred
42 energy accounting adjustment in excess of the maximum allowable
43 adjustment pursuant to subsection 8 or 10.
44 16. A public utility which purchases natural gas for resale or an
45 electric utility that makes quarterly adjustments to its deferred
-
*SB417*
– 17 –
1 energy accounting adjustment pursuant to subsection 8 or 10 may
2 submit to the Commission for approval an application to discontinue
3 making quarterly adjustments to its deferred energy accounting
4 adjustment and to subsequently make annual adjustments to its
5 deferred energy accounting adjustment. The Commission may
6 approve an application submitted pursuant to this subsection if the
7 Commission finds that approval of the application is in the public
8 interest.
9 17. As used in this section:
10 (a) “Deferred energy accounting adjustment” means the rate of a
11 public utility which purchases natural gas for resale or an electric
12 utility that is calculated by dividing the balance of a deferred
13 account during a specified period by the total therms or kilowatt-
14 hours which have been sold in the geographical area to which the
15 rate applies during the specified period, not including kilowatt-hours
16 sold pursuant to an expanded solar access program established
17 pursuant to NRS 704.7865.
18 (b) “Electric utility” has the meaning ascribed to it in
19 NRS 704.187.
20 (c) “Electric utility that primarily serves densely populated
21 counties” means an electric utility that, with regard to the provision
22 of electric service, derives more of its annual gross operating
23 revenue in this State from customers located in counties whose
24 population is 700,000 or more than it does from customers located
25 in counties whose population is less than 700,000.
26 (d) “Electric utility that primarily serves less densely populated
27 counties” means an electric utility that, with regard to the provision
28 of electric service, derives more of its annual gross operating
29 revenue in this State from customers located in counties whose
30 population is less than 700,000 than it does from customers located
31 in counties whose population is 700,000 or more.

S.B. 417
SENATE BILL NO. 417–COMMITTEE ON
GROWTH AND INFRASTRUCTURE
MARCH 20, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Growth and Infrastructure
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to natural gas utilities.
(BDR 58-1106)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to natural gas utilities; requiring the Public
Utilities Commission of Nevada to adopt regulations
governing the filing of an application for the
establishment of an alternative rate-making plan by a
natural gas utility; setting forth certain requirements for
the submission and approval of such an alternative rate-
making plan; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth certain procedures for a public utility to make changes to
2 a general rate schedule by applying to Public Utilities Commission of Nevada.
3 (NRS 704.100, 704.110) Section 11 of this bill requires the Commission to adopt
4 regulations establishing procedures for a natural gas utility to apply to the
5 Commission for the approval of an alternative rate-making plan, which establishes
6 the alternative rate-making mechanisms that the natural gas utility is authorized to
7 use to set rates during the time period of the plan. The regulations adopted by the
8 Commission must: (1) establish the alternative rate-making mechanisms that may
9 be included in a plan and any limitations on such alternative rate-making
10 mechanisms; (2) prescribe the information that must be included in an alternative
11 rate-making plan and an application for the approval of such a plan; (3) specify the
12 circumstances under which a natural gas utility for which an alternative rate-
13 making plan has been approved must file a general rate application; (4) provide a
14 process to educate customers of a natural gas utility regarding alternative rate-
15 making mechanisms; (5) require a natural gas utility for which an alternative rate-
16 making plan has been approved to keep certain records; and (6) establish criteria for
17 the evaluation of an alternative rate-making plan.
18 Section 12 of this bill authorizes a natural gas utility to submit an application to
19 establish an alternative rate-making plan pursuant to the regulations adopted by the
-
*SB417*

– 2 –
20 Commission, establishes time limits for the Commission to approve or deny such
21 an application and requires the Commission to conduct a consumer session before
22 taking action on such an application. Section 12 requires an application for the
23 approval of an alternative rate-making plan to include a plan to educate the
24 customers of the natural gas utility regarding the alternative rate-making
25 mechanisms in the plan proposed by the utility. Section 12 prohibits the
26 Commission from approving an alternative rate-making plan unless the
27 Commission determines that the plan meets certain requirements. Section 12 also
28 authorizes an alternative rate-making plan to include certain provisions, including,
29 without limitation, a mechanism for earnings-sharing with the customers of the
30 utility. If an alternative rate-making plan includes a formula rate, section 12
31 authorizes the Commission to make certain considerations when determining
32 whether to approve the alternative rate-making plan, which include whether the
33 plan includes: (1) the recovery of the cost of certain capital expenditures; and (2) an
34 annual attrition adjustment. Finally, section 12 authorizes the Commission to
35 investigate and change rates, tolls, charges, rules, regulations, practices and services
36 relating to an alternative rate-making plan under certain circumstances. Section 13
37 of this bill provides that the provisions of this bill do not limit the existing rate-
38 making authority of the Commission.
39 Sections 3-10 of this bill define certain terms relating to alternative rate-making
40 plans.
41 Sections 14 and 15 of this bill create exceptions from the procedure set forth in
42 existing law to change a general rate schedule to authorize a natural gas utility
43 to file an application to establish an alternative rate-making plan pursuant to
44 section 12.

29 established by the Commission pursuant to paragraph (g) of
30 subsection 1.
31 Sec. 12. 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2 of
32 section 11 of this act and in accordance with the regulations
33 adopted by the Commission pursuant to section 11 of this act, not
34 earlier than the date on which the Commission first adopts

31 alternative rate-making plan, consider whether the alternative
32 rate-making plan includes:
33 (a) The recovery of the costs of a capital expenditure incurred
34 by the natural gas utility, as adjusted for any accumulated
35 depreciation, deferred taxes and property taxes; or
36 (b) An annual attrition adjustment based on a Consumer Price

1 (f) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (g), if the
2 proposed change in any schedule does not change any rate or will
3 result in an increase in annual gross operating revenue in an amount
4 that does not exceed $15,000:
5 (1) The public utility may file the proposed change with the
6 Commission using a letter of advice in lieu of filing an application;
7 and
8 (2) The Commission shall determine whether it should
9 dispense with a hearing regarding the proposed change.
10  A letter of advice filed pursuant to this paragraph must include a
11 certification by the attorney for the public utility or an affidavit by
12 an authorized representative of the public utility that to the best of
13 the signatory’s knowledge, information and belief, formed after a

16 revenue of the public utility in an amount that exceeds $15,000.
17 (g) If the applicant is a small-scale provider of last resort and the
18 proposed change in any schedule will result in an increase in annual
19 gross operating revenue in an amount that does not exceed $50,000
20 or 10 percent of the applicant’s annual gross operating revenue,
21 whichever is less:
22 (1) The small-scale provider of last resort may file the

39 applicant in accordance with subsection 3 of NRS 704.110; and
40 (2) The Commission shall determine whether it should
41 dispense with a hearing regarding the proposed change.
42  Not later than 10 business days after the filing of a letter of
43 advice pursuant to subparagraph (1), the Regulatory Operations
44 Staff of the Commission or any other interested party may file with
45 the Commission a request that the Commission order an applicant to
-
*SB417*

– 8 –
1 file a general rate application in accordance with subsection 3 of
2 NRS 704.110. The Commission may hold a hearing to consider such
3 a request.
4 (h) In making the determination pursuant to paragraph (f) or (g),
5 the Commission shall first consider all timely written protests, any
6 presentation that the Regulatory Operations Staff of the Commission
7 may desire to present, the application of the public utility and any

15 the applicant provides proof satisfactory to the Commission that the
16 applicant is not earning more than the rate of return authorized by
17 the Commission and that it is in the public interest for the
18 Commission to grant the request for a waiver. The Commission
19 shall not approve a request for a waiver if the request is submitted
20 later than 7 years after the issuance by the Commission of a final
21 order on a general rate application filed by the applicant in
22 accordance with subsection 3 of NRS 704.110. If the Commission
23 approves a request for a waiver submitted pursuant to this
24 subsection, the applicant shall file the letter of advice pursuant to
25 subparagraph (1) of paragraph (g) of subsection 1 not earlier than
26 120 days after the date on which the applicant submitted the request
27 for a waiver pursuant to this subsection, unless the order issued by
28 the Commission approving the request for a waiver specifies a
29 different period for the filing of the letter of advice.
30 3. As used in this section, “electric utility” has the meaning
31 ascribed to it in NRS 704.187.
32 Sec. 15. NRS 704.110 is hereby amended to read as follows:
33 704.110 Except as otherwise provided in NRS 704.075,
34 704.68861 to 704.68887, inclusive, and 704.7865, or as may

37 1. If a public utility files with the Commission an application to
38 make changes in any schedule, including, without limitation,
39 changes that will result in a discontinuance, modification or
40 restriction of service, the Commission shall investigate the propriety
41 of the proposed changes to determine whether to approve or
42 disapprove the proposed changes. If an electric utility files such an
43 application and the application is a general rate application or an
44 annual deferred energy accounting adjustment application, the
45 Consumer’s Advocate shall be deemed a party of record.
-
*SB417*

– 9 –
1 2. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3, if a public
2 utility files with the Commission an application to make changes in
3 any schedule, the Commission shall, not later than 210 days after the
4 date on which the application is filed, issue a written order
5 approving or disapproving, in whole or in part, the proposed
6 changes.
7 3. If a public utility files with the Commission a general rate
8 application, the public utility shall submit with its application a
9 statement showing the recorded results of revenues, expenses,
10 investments and costs of capital for its most recent 12 months for
11 which data were available when the application was prepared.
12 Except as otherwise provided in subsection 4, in determining
13 whether to approve or disapprove any increased rates, the
14 Commission shall consider evidence in support of the increased
15 rates based upon actual recorded results of operations for the same
16 12 months, adjusted for increased revenues, any increased
17 investment in facilities, increased expenses for depreciation, certain
18 other operating expenses as approved by the Commission and
19 changes in the costs of securities which are known and are
20 measurable with reasonable accuracy at the time of filing and which
21 will become effective within 6 months after the last month of those
22 12 months, but the public utility shall not place into effect any
23 increased rates until the changes have been experienced and
24 certified by the public utility to the Commission and the
25 Commission has approved the increased rates. The Commission
26 shall also consider evidence supporting expenses for depreciation,
27 calculated on an annual basis, applicable to major components of the
28 public utility’s plant placed into service during the recorded test
29 period or the period for certification as set forth in the application.
30 Adjustments to revenues, operating expenses and costs of securities
31 must be calculated on an annual basis. Within 90 days after the date
32 on which the certification required by this subsection is filed with
33 the Commission, or within the period set forth in subsection 2,
34 whichever time is longer, the Commission shall make such order in
35 reference to the increased rates as is required by this chapter. The
36 following public utilities shall each file a general rate application
37 pursuant to this subsection based on the following schedule:
38 (a) An electric utility that primarily serves less densely
39 populated counties shall file a general rate application:
40 (1) Not later than 5 p.m. on or before the first Monday in
41 June 2019; and
42 (2) At least once every 36 months thereafter or on a date
43 specified in an alternative rate-making plan approved by the
44 Commission pursuant to NRS 704.7621.
-
*SB417*

– 10 –
1 (b) An electric utility that primarily serves densely populated
2 counties shall file a general rate application:
3 (1) Not later than 5 p.m. on or before the first Monday in
4 June 2020; and
5 (2) At least once every 36 months thereafter or on a date
6 specified in an alternative rate-making plan approved by the
7 Commission pursuant to NRS 704.7621.
8 (c) A public utility that furnishes water for municipal, industrial
9 or domestic purposes or services for the disposal of sewage, or both,
10 which had an annual gross operating revenue of $2,000,000 or more
11 for at least 1 year during the immediately preceding 3 years and
12 which had not filed a general rate application with the Commission
13 on or after July 1, 2005, shall file a general rate application on or
14 before June 30, 2008, and at least once every 36 months thereafter
15 unless waived by the Commission pursuant to standards adopted by
16 regulation of the Commission. If a public utility furnishes both
17 water and services for the disposal of sewage, its annual gross
18 operating revenue for each service must be considered separately for
19 determining whether the public utility meets the requirements of this
20 paragraph for either service.
21 (d) A public utility that furnishes water for municipal, industrial
22 or domestic purposes or services for the disposal of sewage, or both,
23 which had an annual gross operating revenue of $2,000,000 or more
24 for at least 1 year during the immediately preceding 3 years and
25 which had filed a general rate application with the Commission on
26 or after July 1, 2005, shall file a general rate application on or before
27 June 30, 2009, and at least once every 36 months thereafter unless
28 waived by the Commission pursuant to standards adopted by
29 regulation of the Commission. If a public utility furnishes both
30 water and services for the disposal of sewage, its annual gross
31 operating revenue for each service must be considered separately for
32 determining whether the public utility meets the requirements of this
33 paragraph for either service.
34  The Commission shall adopt regulations setting forth standards
35 for waivers pursuant to paragraphs (c) and (d) and for including the
36 costs incurred by the public utility in preparing and presenting the
37 general rate application before the effective date of any change in
38 rates.
39 4. In addition to submitting the statement required pursuant to
40 subsection 3, a public utility may submit with its general rate
41 application a statement showing the effects, on an annualized basis,
42 of all expected changes in circumstances. If such a statement is
43 filed, it must include all increases and decreases in revenue and
44 expenses which may occur within 210 days after the date on which
45 its general rate application is filed with the Commission if such
-
*SB417*

– 11 –
1 expected changes in circumstances are reasonably known and are
2 measurable with reasonable accuracy. If a public utility submits
3 such a statement, the public utility has the burden of proving that the
4 expected changes in circumstances set forth in the statement are
5 reasonably known and are measurable with reasonable accuracy.
6 The Commission shall consider expected changes in circumstances
7 to be reasonably known and measurable with reasonable accuracy if
8 the expected changes in circumstances consist of specific and
9 identifiable events or programs rather than general trends, patterns
10 or developments, have an objectively high probability of occurring
11 to the degree, in the amount and at the time expected, are primarily
12 measurable by recorded or verifiable revenues and expenses and are
13 easily and objectively calculated, with the calculation of the
14 expected changes relying only secondarily on estimates, forecasts,
15 projections or budgets. If the Commission determines that the public
16 utility has met its burden of proof:
17 (a) The Commission shall consider the statement submitted
18 pursuant to this subsection and evidence relevant to the statement,
19 including all reasonable projected or forecasted offsets in revenue
20 and expenses that are directly attributable to or associated with the
21 expected changes in circumstances under consideration, in addition
22 to the statement required pursuant to subsection 3 as evidence in
23 establishing just and reasonable rates for the public utility; and
24 (b) The public utility is not required to file with the Commission
25 the certification that would otherwise be required pursuant to
26 subsection 3.
27 5. If a public utility files with the Commission an application to
28 make changes in any schedule and the Commission does not issue a
29 final written order regarding the proposed changes within the time
30 required by this section, the proposed changes shall be deemed to be
31 approved by the Commission.
32 6. If a public utility files with the Commission a general rate
33 application, the public utility, or a public utility affiliated with the
34 public utility through common ownership, shall not file with the
35 Commission another general rate application until all pending
36 general rate applications filed by that public utility have been
37 decided by the Commission unless, after application and hearing,
38 the Commission determines that a substantial financial emergency
39 would exist if the public utility or its affiliate is not permitted to file
40 another general rate application sooner. The provisions of this
41 subsection do not prohibit a public utility from filing with the
42 Commission, while a general rate application is pending, an
43 application to recover the increased cost of purchased fuel,
44 purchased power, or natural gas purchased for resale pursuant to
45 subsection 7, a quarterly rate adjustment pursuant to subsection 8 or
-
*SB417*

– 12 –
1 10, any information relating to deferred accounting requirements
2 pursuant to NRS 704.185 or an annual deferred energy accounting
3 adjustment application pursuant to NRS 704.187, if the public utility
4 is otherwise authorized to so file by those provisions.
5 7. A public utility may file an application to recover the
6 increased cost of purchased fuel, purchased power, or natural gas
7 purchased for resale once every 30 days. The provisions of this
8 subsection do not apply to:
9 (a) An electric utility which is required to adjust its rates on a
10 quarterly basis pursuant to subsection 10; or
11 (b) A public utility which purchases natural gas for resale and
12 which adjusts its rates on a quarterly basis pursuant to subsection 8.
13 8. A public utility which purchases natural gas for resale must
14 request approval from the Commission to adjust its rates on a
15 quarterly basis between annual rate adjustment applications based
16 on changes in the public utility’s recorded costs of natural gas
17 purchased for resale. A public utility which purchases natural gas
18 for resale and which adjusts its rates on a quarterly basis may
19 request approval from the Commission to make quarterly
20 adjustments to its deferred energy accounting adjustment. The
21 Commission shall approve or deny such a request not later than 120
22 days after the application is filed with the Commission. The
23 Commission may approve the request if the Commission finds that
24 approval of the request is in the public interest. If the Commission
25 approves a request to make quarterly adjustments to the deferred
26 energy accounting adjustment of a public utility pursuant to this
27 subsection, any quarterly adjustment to the deferred energy
28 accounting adjustment must not exceed 2.5 cents per therm of
29 natural gas. If the balance of the public utility’s deferred account
30 varies by less than 5 percent from the public utility’s annual
31 recorded costs of natural gas which are used to calculate quarterly
32 rate adjustments, the deferred energy accounting adjustment must be
33 set to zero cents per therm of natural gas.
34 9. If the Commission approves a request to make any rate
35 adjustments on a quarterly basis pursuant to subsection 8:
36 (a) The public utility shall file written notice with the
37 Commission before the public utility makes a quarterly rate
38 adjustment. A quarterly rate adjustment is not subject to the
39 requirements for notice and a hearing pursuant to NRS 703.320 or
40 the requirements for a consumer session pursuant to subsection 1 of
41 NRS 704.069.
42 (b) The public utility shall provide written notice of each
43 quarterly rate adjustment to its customers by including the written
44 notice with a customer’s regular monthly bill or by electronic
45 transmission pursuant to NRS 704.188. The public utility shall
-
*SB417*

– 13 –
1 begin providing such written notice to its customers not later than 30
2 days after the date on which the public utility files its written notice
3 with the Commission pursuant to paragraph (a). The written notice
4 required by this paragraph:
5 (1) Must be printed separately, if included with the
6 customer’s regular monthly bill, or the subject line of the electronic
7 transmission must indicate that notice of a quarterly rate adjustment
8 is included, if provided by electronic transmission pursuant to NRS
9 704.188; and
10 (2) Must include the following in clear and bold text:
11 (I) The total amount of the increase or decrease in the
12 public utility’s revenues from the rate adjustment, stated in dollars
13 and as a percentage;
14 (II) The amount of the monthly increase or decrease in
15 charges for each class of customer or class of service, stated in
16 dollars and as a percentage;
17 (III) A statement that customers may send written
18 comments or protests regarding the rate adjustment to the
19 Commission;
20 (IV) A statement that the transactions and recorded costs
21 of natural gas which are the basis for any quarterly rate adjustment
22 will be reviewed for reasonableness and prudence in the next
23 proceeding held by the Commission to review the annual rate
24 adjustment application pursuant to paragraph (d); and
25 (V) Any other information required by the Commission.
26 (c) The public utility shall file an annual rate adjustment
27 application with the Commission. The annual rate adjustment
28 application is subject to the requirements for notice and a hearing
29 pursuant to NRS 703.320 and the requirements for a consumer
30 session pursuant to subsection 1 of NRS 704.069.
31 (d) The proceeding regarding the annual rate adjustment
32 application must include a review of each quarterly rate adjustment
33 and the transactions and recorded costs of natural gas included in
34 each quarterly filing and the annual rate adjustment application.
35 There is no presumption of reasonableness or prudence for any
36 quarterly rate adjustment or for any transactions or recorded costs of
37 natural gas included in any quarterly rate adjustment or the annual
38 rate adjustment application, and the public utility has the burden of
39 proving reasonableness and prudence in the proceeding.
40 (e) The Commission shall not allow the public utility to recover
41 any recorded costs of natural gas which were the result of any
42 practice or transaction that was unreasonable or was undertaken,
43 managed or performed imprudently by the public utility, and the
44 Commission shall order the public utility to adjust its rates if the
45 Commission determines that any recorded costs of natural gas
-
*SB417*

– 14 –
1 included in any quarterly rate adjustment or the annual rate
2 adjustment application were not reasonable or prudent.
3 10. An electric utility shall adjust its rates on a quarterly basis
4 based on changes in the electric utility’s recorded costs of purchased
5 fuel or purchased power. In addition to adjusting its rates on a
6 quarterly basis, an electric utility may request approval from the
7 Commission to make quarterly adjustments to its deferred energy
8 accounting adjustment. The Commission shall approve or deny such
9 a request not later than 120 days after the application is filed with
10 the Commission. The Commission may approve the request if the
11 Commission finds that approval of the request is in the public
12 interest. If the Commission approves a request to make quarterly
13 adjustments to the deferred energy accounting adjustment of an
14 electric utility pursuant to this subsection, any quarterly adjustment
15 to the deferred energy accounting adjustment must not exceed 0.25
16 cents per kilowatt-hour of electricity. If the balance of the electric
17 utility’s deferred account varies by less than 5 percent from the
18 electric utility’s annual recorded costs for purchased fuel or
19 purchased power which are used to calculate quarterly rate
20 adjustments, the deferred energy accounting adjustment must be set
21 to zero cents per kilowatt-hour of electricity.
22 11. A quarterly rate adjustment filed pursuant to subsection 10
23 is subject to the following requirements:
24 (a) The electric utility shall file written notice with the
25 Commission on or before August 15, 2007, and every quarter
26 thereafter of the quarterly rate adjustment to be made by the electric
27 utility for the following quarter. The first quarterly rate adjustment
28 by the electric utility will take effect on October 1, 2007, and each
29 subsequent quarterly rate adjustment will take effect every quarter
30 thereafter. The first quarterly adjustment to a deferred energy
31 accounting adjustment must be made pursuant to an order issued by
32 the Commission approving the application of an electric utility to
33 make quarterly adjustments to its deferred energy accounting
34 adjustment. A quarterly rate adjustment is not subject to the
35 requirements for notice and a hearing pursuant to NRS 703.320 or
36 the requirements for a consumer session pursuant to subsection 1 of
37 NRS 704.069.
38 (b) The electric utility shall provide written notice of each
39 quarterly rate adjustment to its customers by including the written
40 notice with a customer’s regular monthly bill or by electronic
41 submission pursuant to NRS 704.188. The electric utility shall begin
42 providing such written notice to its customers not later than 30 days
43 after the date on which the electric utility files a written notice with
44 the Commission pursuant to paragraph (a). The written notice
45 required by this paragraph:
-
*SB417*

– 15 –
1 (1) Must be printed separately, if included with the
2 customer’s regular monthly bill, or the subject line of the electronic
3 transmission must indicate that notice of a quarterly rate adjustment
4 is included, if provided by electronic transmission pursuant to NRS
5 704.188; and
6 (2) Must include the following in clear and bold text:
7 (I) The total amount of the increase or decrease in the
8 electric utility’s revenues from the rate adjustment, stated in dollars
9 and as a percentage;
10 (II) The amount of the monthly increase or decrease in
11 charges for each class of customer or class of service, stated in
12 dollars and as a percentage;
13 (III) A statement that customers may send written
14 comments or protests regarding the rate adjustment to the
15 Commission;
16 (IV) A statement that the transactions and recorded costs
17 of purchased fuel or purchased power which are the basis for any
18 quarterly rate adjustment will be reviewed for reasonableness and
19 prudence in the next proceeding held by the Commission to review
20 the annual deferred energy accounting adjustment application
21 pursuant to paragraph (d); and
22 (V) Any other information required by the Commission.
23 (c) The electric utility shall file an annual deferred energy
24 accounting adjustment application pursuant to NRS 704.187 with
25 the Commission. The annual deferred energy accounting adjustment
26 application is subject to the requirements for notice and a hearing
27 pursuant to NRS 703.320 and the requirements for a consumer
28 session pursuant to subsection 1 of NRS 704.069.
29 (d) The proceeding regarding the annual deferred energy
30 accounting adjustment application must include a review of each
31 quarterly rate adjustment and the transactions and recorded costs of
32 purchased fuel and purchased power included in each quarterly
33 filing and the annual deferred energy accounting adjustment
34 application. There is no presumption of reasonableness or prudence
35 for any quarterly rate adjustment or for any transactions or recorded
36 costs of purchased fuel and purchased power included in any
37 quarterly rate adjustment or the annual deferred energy accounting
38 adjustment application, and the electric utility has the burden of
39 proving reasonableness and prudence in the proceeding.
40 (e) The Commission shall not allow the electric utility to recover
41 any recorded costs of purchased fuel and purchased power which
42 were the result of any practice or transaction that was unreasonable
43 or was undertaken, managed or performed imprudently by the
44 electric utility, and the Commission shall order the electric utility to
45 adjust its rates if the Commission determines that any recorded costs
-
*SB417*

– 16 –
1 of purchased fuel and purchased power included in any quarterly
2 rate adjustment or the annual deferred energy accounting adjustment
3 application were not reasonable or prudent.
4 12. If an electric utility files an annual deferred energy
5 accounting adjustment application pursuant to subsection 11 and
6 NRS 704.187 while a general rate application is pending, the
7 electric utility shall:
8 (a) Submit with its annual deferred energy accounting
9 adjustment application information relating to the cost of service
10 and rate design; and
11 (b) Supplement its general rate application with the same
12 information, if such information was not submitted with the general
13 rate application.
14 13. A utility facility identified in a 3-year plan submitted
15 pursuant to NRS 704.741 and accepted by the Commission for
16 acquisition or construction pursuant to NRS 704.751 and the
17 regulations adopted pursuant thereto, or the retirement or
18 elimination of a utility facility identified in an emissions reduction
19 and capacity replacement plan submitted pursuant to NRS 704.7316
20 and accepted by the Commission for retirement or elimination
21 pursuant to NRS 704.751 and the regulations adopted pursuant
22 thereto, shall be deemed to be a prudent investment. The utility may
23 recover all just and reasonable costs of planning and constructing, or
24 retiring or eliminating, as applicable, such a facility. For the
25 purposes of this subsection, a plan or an amendment to a plan shall
26 be deemed to be accepted by the Commission only as to that portion
27 of the plan or amendment accepted as filed or modified with the
28 consent of the utility pursuant to NRS 704.751.
29 14. In regard to any rate or schedule approved or disapproved
30 pursuant to this section, the Commission may, after a hearing:
31 (a) Upon the request of the utility, approve a new rate but delay
32 the implementation of that new rate:
33 (1) Until a date determined by the Commission; and
34 (2) Under conditions as determined by the Commission,
35 including, without limitation, a requirement that interest charges be
36 included in the collection of the new rate; and
37 (b) Authorize a utility to implement a reduced rate for low-
38 income residential customers.
39 15. The Commission may, upon request and for good cause
40 shown, permit a public utility which purchases natural gas for resale
41 or an electric utility to make a quarterly adjustment to its deferred
42 energy accounting adjustment in excess of the maximum allowable
43 adjustment pursuant to subsection 8 or 10.
44 16. A public utility which purchases natural gas for resale or an
45 electric utility that makes quarterly adjustments to its deferred
-
*SB417*

– 17 –
1 energy accounting adjustment pursuant to subsection 8 or 10 may
2 submit to the Commission for approval an application to discontinue
3 making quarterly adjustments to its deferred energy accounting
4 adjustment and to subsequently make annual adjustments to its
5 deferred energy accounting adjustment. The Commission may
6 approve an application submitted pursuant to this subsection if the
7 Commission finds that approval of the application is in the public
8 interest.
9 17. As used in this section:
10 (a) “Deferred energy accounting adjustment” means the rate of a
11 public utility which purchases natural gas for resale or an electric
12 utility that is calculated by dividing the balance of a deferred
13 account during a specified period by the total therms or kilowatt-
14 hours which have been sold in the geographical area to which the
15 rate applies during the specified period, not including kilowatt-hours
16 sold pursuant to an expanded solar access program established
17 pursuant to NRS 704.7865.
18 (b) “Electric utility” has the meaning ascribed to it in
19 NRS 704.187.
20 (c) “Electric utility that primarily serves densely populated
21 counties” means an electric utility that, with regard to the provision
22 of electric service, derives more of its annual gross operating
23 revenue in this State from customers located in counties whose
24 population is 700,000 or more than it does from customers located
25 in counties whose population is less than 700,000.
26 (d) “Electric utility that primarily serves less densely populated
27 counties” means an electric utility that, with regard to the provision
28 of electric service, derives more of its annual gross operating
29 revenue in this State from customers located in counties whose
30 population is less than 700,000 than it does from customers located
31 in counties whose population is 700,000 or more.
