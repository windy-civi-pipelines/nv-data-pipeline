AN ACT relating to natural gas utilities; requiring the Public Utilities Commission
of Nevada to adopt regulations governing the filing of an application
for the establishment of an alternative rate-making plan by a natural
gas utility; setting forth certain requirements for the submission and
approval of such an alternative rate-making plan; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth certain procedures for a public utility to make changes to a general
2 rate schedule by applying to Public Utilities Commission of Nevada. (NRS 704.100, 704.110)
3 Section 11 of this bill requires the Commission to adopt regulations establishing procedures
4 for a natural gas utility to apply to the Commission for the approval of an alternative rate-
5 making plan, which establishes the alternative rate-making mechanisms that the natural gas
6 utility is authorized to use to set rates during the time period of the plan. The regulations
7 adopted by the Commission must: (1) establish the alternative rate-making mechanisms that
8 may be included in a plan and any limitations on such alternative rate-making mechanisms;
9 (2) prescribe the information that must be included in an alternative rate-making plan and an
10 application for the approval of such a plan; (3) specify the circumstances under which a
11 natural gas utility for which an alternative rate-making plan has been approved must file a
12 general rate application; (4) provide a process to educate customers of a natural gas utility
13 regarding alternative rate-making mechanisms; (5) require a natural gas utility for which an
14 alternative rate-making plan has been approved to keep certain records; and (6) establish
15 criteria for the evaluation of an alternative rate-making plan. Additionally, section 11
16 authorizes the Commission to adopt regulations to establish one or more methods to
17 establish a formula for a formula rate.
18 Section 12 of this bill authorizes a natural gas utility to submit an application to establish
19 an alternative rate-making plan pursuant to the regulations adopted by the Commission,
20 establishes time limits for the Commission to approve or deny such an application and
21 requires the Commission to conduct a consumer session before taking action on such an
22 application. Section 12 requires an application for the approval of an alternative rate-making
23 plan to include a plan to educate the customers of the natural gas utility regarding the
24 alternative rate-making mechanisms in the plan proposed by the utility. Section 12 prohibits
25 the Commission from approving an alternative rate-making plan unless the Commission
26 determines that the plan meets certain requirements. Section 12 also authorizes an alternative
27 rate-making plan to include certain provisions, including, without limitation, a mechanism for
Senate Amendment No. 244 to Senate Bill No. 417 Page 4
28 earnings-sharing with the customers of the utility. [If an alternative rate-making plan includes
29 a formula rate, section 12 authorizes the Commission to make certain considerations when
30 determining whether to approve the alternative rate-making plan, which include whether the
31 plan includes: (1) the recovery of the cost of certain capital expenditures; and (2) an annual
32 attrition adjustment.] Additionally, section 12 authorizes a natural gas utility to reject an
33 application for an alternative rate-making plan with modifications approved by the
34 Commission. Finally, section 12 authorizes the Commission to investigate and change rates,
35 tolls, charges, rules, regulations, practices and services relating to an alternative rate-making
36 plan under certain circumstances. Section 13 of this bill provides that the provisions of this
37 bill do not limit the existing rate-making authority of the Commission.
38 Sections 3-10 of this bill define certain terms relating to alternative rate-making plans.
39 Sections 14 and 15 of this bill create exceptions from the procedure set forth in existing
40 law to change a general rate schedule to authorize a natural gas utility to file an application to
41 establish an alternative rate-making plan pursuant to section 12.

40 plan, and, after a full hearing as provided in NRS 704.120, by order, make such
41 changes as may be just and reasonable to the same extent as authorized by NRS
42 704.120.
43 Sec. 13. The provisions of sections 2 to 12, inclusive, of this act must not be
44 construed to limit the existing rate-making authority of the Commission.
45 Sec. 14. NRS 704.100 is hereby amended to read as follows:
46 704.100 1. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 704.075, 704.68861 to

13 amended schedules in the same offices and in substantially the same form, manner
14 and places as required by NRS 704.070 for the posting of copies of schedules that
15 are currently in force.
16 (e) A public utility may not set forth as justification for a rate increase any
17 items of expense or rate base that previously have been considered and disallowed
18 by the Commission, unless those items are clearly identified in the application and
19 new facts or considerations of policy for each item are advanced in the application
20 to justify a reversal of the prior decision of the Commission.
21 (f) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (g), if the proposed change in
22 any schedule does not change any rate or will result in an increase in annual gross
23 operating revenue in an amount that does not exceed $15,000:

25 using a letter of advice in lieu of filing an application; and
26 (2) The Commission shall determine whether it should dispense with a
27 hearing regarding the proposed change.

31 belief, formed after a reasonable inquiry, the proposed change in schedule does not
32 change any rate or result in an increase in the annual gross operating revenue of the
33 public utility in an amount that exceeds $15,000.
34 (g) If the applicant is a small-scale provider of last resort and the proposed
35 change in any schedule will result in an increase in annual gross operating revenue

45 change in schedule does not change any rate or result in an increase in the annual
46 gross operating revenue of the small-scale provider of last resort in an amount that
47 exceeds $50,000 or 10 percent, whichever is less;

7 interested party may file with the Commission a request that the Commission order
8 an applicant to file a general rate application in accordance with subsection 3 of
9 NRS 704.110. The Commission may hold a hearing to consider such a request.
10 (h) In making the determination pursuant to paragraph (f) or (g), the
11 Commission shall first consider all timely written protests, any presentation that the
12 Regulatory Operations Staff of the Commission may desire to present, the
13 application of the public utility and any other matters deemed relevant by the
14 Commission.
15 2. An applicant that is a small-scale provider of last resort may submit to the
16 Commission a written request for a waiver of the 5-year period specified in sub-
17 subparagraph (III) of subparagraph (1) of paragraph (g) of subsection 1. The
18 Commission shall, not later than 90 days after receipt of such a request, issue an
19 order approving or denying the request. The Commission may approve the request
20 if the applicant provides proof satisfactory to the Commission that the applicant is
21 not earning more than the rate of return authorized by the Commission and that it is
22 in the public interest for the Commission to grant the request for a waiver. The
23 Commission shall not approve a request for a waiver if the request is submitted
24 later than 7 years after the issuance by the Commission of a final order on a general
25 rate application filed by the applicant in accordance with subsection 3 of NRS
26 704.110. If the Commission approves a request for a waiver submitted pursuant to
27 this subsection, the applicant shall file the letter of advice pursuant to subparagraph
28 (1) of paragraph (g) of subsection 1 not earlier than 120 days after the date on

31 specifies a different period for the filing of the letter of advice.
32 3. As used in this section, “electric utility” has the meaning ascribed to it in
33 NRS 704.187.
34 Sec. 15. NRS 704.110 is hereby amended to read as follows:
35 704.110 Except as otherwise provided in NRS 704.075, 704.68861 to
36 704.68887, inclusive, and 704.7865, or as may otherwise be provided by the
37 Commission pursuant to NRS 704.095, 704.097 or 704.7621 [:] or section 12 of
38 this act:
39 1. If a public utility files with the Commission an application to make changes
40 in any schedule, including, without limitation, changes that will result in a
41 discontinuance, modification or restriction of service, the Commission shall
42 investigate the propriety of the proposed changes to determine whether to approve
43 or disapprove the proposed changes. If an electric utility files such an application
44 and the application is a general rate application or an annual deferred energy
45 accounting adjustment application, the Consumer’s Advocate shall be deemed a
46 party of record.
47 2. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3, if a public utility files with
48 the Commission an application to make changes in any schedule, the Commission
49 shall, not later than 210 days after the date on which the application is filed, issue a
50 written order approving or disapproving, in whole or in part, the proposed changes.
51 3. If a public utility files with the Commission a general rate application, the
52 public utility shall submit with its application a statement showing the recorded
53 results of revenues, expenses, investments and costs of capital for its most recent 12
Senate Amendment No. 244 to Senate Bill No. 417 Page 10
1 months for which data were available when the application was prepared. Except as
2 otherwise provided in subsection 4, in determining whether to approve or
3 disapprove any increased rates, the Commission shall consider evidence in support
4 of the increased rates based upon actual recorded results of operations for the same
5 12 months, adjusted for increased revenues, any increased investment in facilities,
6 increased expenses for depreciation, certain other operating expenses as approved
7 by the Commission and changes in the costs of securities which are known and are
8 measurable with reasonable accuracy at the time of filing and which will become
9 effective within 6 months after the last month of those 12 months, but the public
10 utility shall not place into effect any increased rates until the changes have been
11 experienced and certified by the public utility to the Commission and the
12 Commission has approved the increased rates. The Commission shall also consider
13 evidence supporting expenses for depreciation, calculated on an annual basis,
14 applicable to major components of the public utility’s plant placed into service
15 during the recorded test period or the period for certification as set forth in the
16 application. Adjustments to revenues, operating expenses and costs of securities
17 must be calculated on an annual basis. Within 90 days after the date on which the
18 certification required by this subsection is filed with the Commission, or within the
19 period set forth in subsection 2, whichever time is longer, the Commission shall
20 make such order in reference to the increased rates as is required by this chapter.
21 The following public utilities shall each file a general rate application pursuant to
22 this subsection based on the following schedule:
23 (a) An electric utility that primarily serves less densely populated counties

36 purposes or services for the disposal of sewage, or both, which had an annual gross
37 operating revenue of $2,000,000 or more for at least 1 year during the immediately
38 preceding 3 years and which had not filed a general rate application with the
39 Commission on or after July 1, 2005, shall file a general rate application on or
40 before June 30, 2008, and at least once every 36 months thereafter unless waived by
41 the Commission pursuant to standards adopted by regulation of the Commission. If
42 a public utility furnishes both water and services for the disposal of sewage, its
43 annual gross operating revenue for each service must be considered separately for
44 determining whether the public utility meets the requirements of this paragraph for
45 either service.
46 (d) A public utility that furnishes water for municipal, industrial or domestic
47 purposes or services for the disposal of sewage, or both, which had an annual gross
48 operating revenue of $2,000,000 or more for at least 1 year during the immediately
49 preceding 3 years and which had filed a general rate application with the
50 Commission on or after July 1, 2005, shall file a general rate application on or
51 before June 30, 2009, and at least once every 36 months thereafter unless waived by
52 the Commission pursuant to standards adopted by regulation of the Commission. If
53 a public utility furnishes both water and services for the disposal of sewage, its
Senate Amendment No. 244 to Senate Bill No. 417 Page 11
1 annual gross operating revenue for each service must be considered separately for
2 determining whether the public utility meets the requirements of this paragraph for
3 either service.
4  The Commission shall adopt regulations setting forth standards for waivers
5 pursuant to paragraphs (c) and (d) and for including the costs incurred by the public
6 utility in preparing and presenting the general rate application before the effective
7 date of any change in rates.
8 4. In addition to submitting the statement required pursuant to subsection 3, a
9 public utility may submit with its general rate application a statement showing the
10 effects, on an annualized basis, of all expected changes in circumstances. If such a
11 statement is filed, it must include all increases and decreases in revenue and
12 expenses which may occur within 210 days after the date on which its general rate
13 application is filed with the Commission if such expected changes in circumstances
14 are reasonably known and are measurable with reasonable accuracy. If a public
15 utility submits such a statement, the public utility has the burden of proving that the
16 expected changes in circumstances set forth in the statement are reasonably known
17 and are measurable with reasonable accuracy. The Commission shall consider
18 expected changes in circumstances to be reasonably known and measurable with
19 reasonable accuracy if the expected changes in circumstances consist of specific
20 and identifiable events or programs rather than general trends, patterns or
21 developments, have an objectively high probability of occurring to the degree, in
22 the amount and at the time expected, are primarily measurable by recorded or
23 verifiable revenues and expenses and are easily and objectively calculated, with the
24 calculation of the expected changes relying only secondarily on estimates,
25 forecasts, projections or budgets. If the Commission determines that the public
26 utility has met its burden of proof:
27 (a) The Commission shall consider the statement submitted pursuant to this
28 subsection and evidence relevant to the statement, including all reasonable
29 projected or forecasted offsets in revenue and expenses that are directly attributable
30 to or associated with the expected changes in circumstances under consideration, in
31 addition to the statement required pursuant to subsection 3 as evidence in
32 establishing just and reasonable rates for the public utility; and
33 (b) The public utility is not required to file with the Commission the
34 certification that would otherwise be required pursuant to subsection 3.
35 5. If a public utility files with the Commission an application to make changes
36 in any schedule and the Commission does not issue a final written order regarding
37 the proposed changes within the time required by this section, the proposed changes
38 shall be deemed to be approved by the Commission.
39 6. If a public utility files with the Commission a general rate application, the
40 public utility, or a public utility affiliated with the public utility through common
41 ownership, shall not file with the Commission another general rate application until
42 all pending general rate applications filed by that public utility have been decided
43 by the Commission unless, after application and hearing, the Commission
44 determines that a substantial financial emergency would exist if the public utility or
45 its affiliate is not permitted to file another general rate application sooner. The
46 provisions of this subsection do not prohibit a public utility from filing with the
47 Commission, while a general rate application is pending, an application to recover
48 the increased cost of purchased fuel, purchased power, or natural gas purchased for
49 resale pursuant to subsection 7, a quarterly rate adjustment pursuant to subsection 8
50 or 10, any information relating to deferred accounting requirements pursuant to
51 NRS 704.185 or an annual deferred energy accounting adjustment application
52 pursuant to NRS 704.187, if the public utility is otherwise authorized to so file by
53 those provisions.
Senate Amendment No. 244 to Senate Bill No. 417 Page 12
1 7. A public utility may file an application to recover the increased cost of
2 purchased fuel, purchased power, or natural gas purchased for resale once every 30
3 days. The provisions of this subsection do not apply to:
4 (a) An electric utility which is required to adjust its rates on a quarterly basis
5 pursuant to subsection 10; or
6 (b) A public utility which purchases natural gas for resale and which adjusts its
7 rates on a quarterly basis pursuant to subsection 8.
8 8. A public utility which purchases natural gas for resale must request
9 approval from the Commission to adjust its rates on a quarterly basis between
10 annual rate adjustment applications based on changes in the public utility’s
11 recorded costs of natural gas purchased for resale. A public utility which purchases
12 natural gas for resale and which adjusts its rates on a quarterly basis may request
13 approval from the Commission to make quarterly adjustments to its deferred energy
14 accounting adjustment. The Commission shall approve or deny such a request not
15 later than 120 days after the application is filed with the Commission. The
16 Commission may approve the request if the Commission finds that approval of the
17 request is in the public interest. If the Commission approves a request to make
18 quarterly adjustments to the deferred energy accounting adjustment of a public
19 utility pursuant to this subsection, any quarterly adjustment to the deferred energy
20 accounting adjustment must not exceed 2.5 cents per therm of natural gas. If the
21 balance of the public utility’s deferred account varies by less than 5 percent from
22 the public utility’s annual recorded costs of natural gas which are used to calculate
23 quarterly rate adjustments, the deferred energy accounting adjustment must be set
24 to zero cents per therm of natural gas.
25 9. If the Commission approves a request to make any rate adjustments on a
26 quarterly basis pursuant to subsection 8:
27 (a) The public utility shall file written notice with the Commission before the
28 public utility makes a quarterly rate adjustment. A quarterly rate adjustment is not
29 subject to the requirements for notice and a hearing pursuant to NRS 703.320 or the
30 requirements for a consumer session pursuant to subsection 1 of NRS 704.069.
31 (b) The public utility shall provide written notice of each quarterly rate
32 adjustment to its customers by including the written notice with a customer’s
33 regular monthly bill or by electronic transmission pursuant to NRS 704.188. The
34 public utility shall begin providing such written notice to its customers not later
35 than 30 days after the date on which the public utility files its written notice with
36 the Commission pursuant to paragraph (a). The written notice required by this
37 paragraph:
38 (1) Must be printed separately, if included with the customer’s regular
39 monthly bill, or the subject line of the electronic transmission must indicate that
40 notice of a quarterly rate adjustment is included, if provided by electronic
41 transmission pursuant to NRS 704.188; and
42 (2) Must include the following in clear and bold text:
43 (I) The total amount of the increase or decrease in the public utility’s
44 revenues from the rate adjustment, stated in dollars and as a percentage;
45 (II) The amount of the monthly increase or decrease in charges for
46 each class of customer or class of service, stated in dollars and as a percentage;
47 (III) A statement that customers may send written comments or
48 protests regarding the rate adjustment to the Commission;
49 (IV) A statement that the transactions and recorded costs of natural gas
50 which are the basis for any quarterly rate adjustment will be reviewed for
51 reasonableness and prudence in the next proceeding held by the Commission to
52 review the annual rate adjustment application pursuant to paragraph (d); and
53 (V) Any other information required by the Commission.
Senate Amendment No. 244 to Senate Bill No. 417 Page 13
1 (c) The public utility shall file an annual rate adjustment application with the
2 Commission. The annual rate adjustment application is subject to the requirements
3 for notice and a hearing pursuant to NRS 703.320 and the requirements for a
4 consumer session pursuant to subsection 1 of NRS 704.069.
5 (d) The proceeding regarding the annual rate adjustment application must
6 include a review of each quarterly rate adjustment and the transactions and recorded
7 costs of natural gas included in each quarterly filing and the annual rate adjustment
8 application. There is no presumption of reasonableness or prudence for any
9 quarterly rate adjustment or for any transactions or recorded costs of natural gas
10 included in any quarterly rate adjustment or the annual rate adjustment application,
11 and the public utility has the burden of proving reasonableness and prudence in the
12 proceeding.
13 (e) The Commission shall not allow the public utility to recover any recorded
14 costs of natural gas which were the result of any practice or transaction that was
15 unreasonable or was undertaken, managed or performed imprudently by the public
16 utility, and the Commission shall order the public utility to adjust its rates if the
17 Commission determines that any recorded costs of natural gas included in any
18 quarterly rate adjustment or the annual rate adjustment application were not
19 reasonable or prudent.
20 10. An electric utility shall adjust its rates on a quarterly basis based on
21 changes in the electric utility’s recorded costs of purchased fuel or purchased
22 power. In addition to adjusting its rates on a quarterly basis, an electric utility may
23 request approval from the Commission to make quarterly adjustments to its
24 deferred energy accounting adjustment. The Commission shall approve or deny
25 such a request not later than 120 days after the application is filed with the
26 Commission. The Commission may approve the request if the Commission finds
27 that approval of the request is in the public interest. If the Commission approves a
28 request to make quarterly adjustments to the deferred energy accounting adjustment
29 of an electric utility pursuant to this subsection, any quarterly adjustment to the
30 deferred energy accounting adjustment must not exceed 0.25 cents per kilowatt-
31 hour of electricity. If the balance of the electric utility’s deferred account varies by
32 less than 5 percent from the electric utility’s annual recorded costs for purchased
33 fuel or purchased power which are used to calculate quarterly rate adjustments, the
34 deferred energy accounting adjustment must be set to zero cents per kilowatt-hour
35 of electricity.
36 11. A quarterly rate adjustment filed pursuant to subsection 10 is subject to
37 the following requirements:
38 (a) The electric utility shall file written notice with the Commission on or
39 before August 15, 2007, and every quarter thereafter of the quarterly rate
40 adjustment to be made by the electric utility for the following quarter. The first
41 quarterly rate adjustment by the electric utility will take effect on October 1, 2007,
42 and each subsequent quarterly rate adjustment will take effect every quarter
43 thereafter. The first quarterly adjustment to a deferred energy accounting
44 adjustment must be made pursuant to an order issued by the Commission approving
45 the application of an electric utility to make quarterly adjustments to its deferred
46 energy accounting adjustment. A quarterly rate adjustment is not subject to the
47 requirements for notice and a hearing pursuant to NRS 703.320 or the requirements
48 for a consumer session pursuant to subsection 1 of NRS 704.069.
49 (b) The electric utility shall provide written notice of each quarterly rate
50 adjustment to its customers by including the written notice with a customer’s
51 regular monthly bill or by electronic submission pursuant to NRS 704.188. The
52 electric utility shall begin providing such written notice to its customers not later
53 than 30 days after the date on which the electric utility files a written notice with
Senate Amendment No. 244 to Senate Bill No. 417 Page 14
1 the Commission pursuant to paragraph (a). The written notice required by this
2 paragraph:
3 (1) Must be printed separately, if included with the customer’s regular
4 monthly bill, or the subject line of the electronic transmission must indicate that
5 notice of a quarterly rate adjustment is included, if provided by electronic
6 transmission pursuant to NRS 704.188; and
7 (2) Must include the following in clear and bold text:
8 (I) The total amount of the increase or decrease in the electric utility’s
9 revenues from the rate adjustment, stated in dollars and as a percentage;
10 (II) The amount of the monthly increase or decrease in charges for
11 each class of customer or class of service, stated in dollars and as a percentage;
12 (III) A statement that customers may send written comments or
13 protests regarding the rate adjustment to the Commission;
14 (IV) A statement that the transactions and recorded costs of purchased
15 fuel or purchased power which are the basis for any quarterly rate adjustment will
16 be reviewed for reasonableness and prudence in the next proceeding held by the
17 Commission to review the annual deferred energy accounting adjustment
18 application pursuant to paragraph (d); and
19 (V) Any other information required by the Commission.
20 (c) The electric utility shall file an annual deferred energy accounting
21 adjustment application pursuant to NRS 704.187 with the Commission. The annual
22 deferred energy accounting adjustment application is subject to the requirements for
23 notice and a hearing pursuant to NRS 703.320 and the requirements for a consumer
24 session pursuant to subsection 1 of NRS 704.069.
25 (d) The proceeding regarding the annual deferred energy accounting
26 adjustment application must include a review of each quarterly rate adjustment and
27 the transactions and recorded costs of purchased fuel and purchased power included
28 in each quarterly filing and the annual deferred energy accounting adjustment
29 application. There is no presumption of reasonableness or prudence for any
30 quarterly rate adjustment or for any transactions or recorded costs of purchased fuel
31 and purchased power included in any quarterly rate adjustment or the annual
32 deferred energy accounting adjustment application, and the electric utility has the
33 burden of proving reasonableness and prudence in the proceeding.
34 (e) The Commission shall not allow the electric utility to recover any recorded
35 costs of purchased fuel and purchased power which were the result of any practice
36 or transaction that was unreasonable or was undertaken, managed or performed
37 imprudently by the electric utility, and the Commission shall order the electric
38 utility to adjust its rates if the Commission determines that any recorded costs of
39 purchased fuel and purchased power included in any quarterly rate adjustment or
40 the annual deferred energy accounting adjustment application were not reasonable
41 or prudent.
42 12. If an electric utility files an annual deferred energy accounting adjustment
43 application pursuant to subsection 11 and NRS 704.187 while a general rate
44 application is pending, the electric utility shall:
45 (a) Submit with its annual deferred energy accounting adjustment application
46 information relating to the cost of service and rate design; and
47 (b) Supplement its general rate application with the same information, if such
48 information was not submitted with the general rate application.
49 13. A utility facility identified in a 3-year plan submitted pursuant to NRS
50 704.741 and accepted by the Commission for acquisition or construction pursuant
51 to NRS 704.751 and the regulations adopted pursuant thereto, or the retirement or
52 elimination of a utility facility identified in an emissions reduction and capacity
53 replacement plan submitted pursuant to NRS 704.7316 and accepted by the
Senate Amendment No. 244 to Senate Bill No. 417 Page 15
1 Commission for retirement or elimination pursuant to NRS 704.751 and the
2 regulations adopted pursuant thereto, shall be deemed to be a prudent investment.
3 The utility may recover all just and reasonable costs of planning and constructing,
4 or retiring or eliminating, as applicable, such a facility. For the purposes of this
5 subsection, a plan or an amendment to a plan shall be deemed to be accepted by the
6 Commission only as to that portion of the plan or amendment accepted as filed or
7 modified with the consent of the utility pursuant to NRS 704.751.
8 14. In regard to any rate or schedule approved or disapproved pursuant to this
9 section, the Commission may, after a hearing:
10 (a) Upon the request of the utility, approve a new rate but delay the
11 implementation of that new rate:
12 (1) Until a date determined by the Commission; and
13 (2) Under conditions as determined by the Commission, including, without
14 limitation, a requirement that interest charges be included in the collection of the
15 new rate; and
16 (b) Authorize a utility to implement a reduced rate for low-income residential
17 customers.
18 15. The Commission may, upon request and for good cause shown, permit a
19 public utility which purchases natural gas for resale or an electric utility to make a
20 quarterly adjustment to its deferred energy accounting adjustment in excess of the
21 maximum allowable adjustment pursuant to subsection 8 or 10.
22 16. A public utility which purchases natural gas for resale or an electric utility
23 that makes quarterly adjustments to its deferred energy accounting adjustment
24 pursuant to subsection 8 or 10 may submit to the Commission for approval an
25 application to discontinue making quarterly adjustments to its deferred energy
26 accounting adjustment and to subsequently make annual adjustments to its deferred
27 energy accounting adjustment. The Commission may approve an application
28 submitted pursuant to this subsection if the Commission finds that approval of the
29 application is in the public interest.
30 17. As used in this section:
31 (a) “Deferred energy accounting adjustment” means the rate of a public utility
32 which purchases natural gas for resale or an electric utility that is calculated by
33 dividing the balance of a deferred account during a specified period by the total
34 therms or kilowatt-hours which have been sold in the geographical area to which
35 the rate applies during the specified period, not including kilowatt-hours sold
36 pursuant to an expanded solar access program established pursuant to NRS
37 704.7865.
38 (b) “Electric utility” has the meaning ascribed to it in NRS 704.187.
39 (c) “Electric utility that primarily serves densely populated counties” means an
40 electric utility that, with regard to the provision of electric service, derives more of
41 its annual gross operating revenue in this State from customers located in counties
42 whose population is 700,000 or more than it does from customers located in
43 counties whose population is less than 700,000.
44 (d) “Electric utility that primarily serves less densely populated counties”
45 means an electric utility that, with regard to the provision of electric service,
46 derives more of its annual gross operating revenue in this State from customers
47 located in counties whose population is less than 700,000 than it does from
48 customers located in counties whose population is 700,000 or more.

AN ACT relating to natural gas utilities; requiring the Public Utilities Commission
of Nevada to adopt regulations governing the filing of an application
for the establishment of an alternative rate-making plan by a natural
gas utility; setting forth certain requirements for the submission and
approval of such an alternative rate-making plan; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth certain procedures for a public utility to make changes to a general
2 rate schedule by applying to Public Utilities Commission of Nevada. (NRS 704.100, 704.110)
3 Section 11 of this bill requires the Commission to adopt regulations establishing procedures
4 for a natural gas utility to apply to the Commission for the approval of an alternative rate-
5 making plan, which establishes the alternative rate-making mechanisms that the natural gas
6 utility is authorized to use to set rates during the time period of the plan. The regulations
7 adopted by the Commission must: (1) establish the alternative rate-making mechanisms that
8 may be included in a plan and any limitations on such alternative rate-making mechanisms;
9 (2) prescribe the information that must be included in an alternative rate-making plan and an
10 application for the approval of such a plan; (3) specify the circumstances under which a
11 natural gas utility for which an alternative rate-making plan has been approved must file a
12 general rate application; (4) provide a process to educate customers of a natural gas utility
13 regarding alternative rate-making mechanisms; (5) require a natural gas utility for which an
14 alternative rate-making plan has been approved to keep certain records; and (6) establish
15 criteria for the evaluation of an alternative rate-making plan. Additionally, section 11
16 authorizes the Commission to adopt regulations to establish one or more methods to
17 establish a formula for a formula rate.
18 Section 12 of this bill authorizes a natural gas utility to submit an application to establish
19 an alternative rate-making plan pursuant to the regulations adopted by the Commission,
20 establishes time limits for the Commission to approve or deny such an application and
21 requires the Commission to conduct a consumer session before taking action on such an
22 application. Section 12 requires an application for the approval of an alternative rate-making
23 plan to include a plan to educate the customers of the natural gas utility regarding the
24 alternative rate-making mechanisms in the plan proposed by the utility. Section 12 prohibits
25 the Commission from approving an alternative rate-making plan unless the Commission
26 determines that the plan meets certain requirements. Section 12 also authorizes an alternative
27 rate-making plan to include certain provisions, including, without limitation, a mechanism for

Senate Amendment No. 244 to Senate Bill No. 417 Page 4
28 earnings-sharing with the customers of the utility. [If an alternative rate-making plan includes
29 a formula rate, section 12 authorizes the Commission to make certain considerations when
30 determining whether to approve the alternative rate-making plan, which include whether the
31 plan includes: (1) the recovery of the cost of certain capital expenditures; and (2) an annual
32 attrition adjustment.] Additionally, section 12 authorizes a natural gas utility to reject an
33 application for an alternative rate-making plan with modifications approved by the
34 Commission. Finally, section 12 authorizes the Commission to investigate and change rates,
35 tolls, charges, rules, regulations, practices and services relating to an alternative rate-making
36 plan under certain circumstances. Section 13 of this bill provides that the provisions of this
37 bill do not limit the existing rate-making authority of the Commission.
38 Sections 3-10 of this bill define certain terms relating to alternative rate-making plans.
39 Sections 14 and 15 of this bill create exceptions from the procedure set forth in existing
40 law to change a general rate schedule to authorize a natural gas utility to file an application to
41 establish an alternative rate-making plan pursuant to section 12.

46 704.100 1. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 704.075, 704.68861 to
47 704.68887, inclusive, 704.7865 and 704.7867, or as may otherwise be provided by

15 are currently in force.
16 (e) A public utility may not set forth as justification for a rate increase any
17 items of expense or rate base that previously have been considered and disallowed
18 by the Commission, unless those items are clearly identified in the application and

20 to justify a reversal of the prior decision of the Commission.
21 (f) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (g), if the proposed change in
22 any schedule does not change any rate or will result in an increase in annual gross

14 Commission.
15 2. An applicant that is a small-scale provider of last resort may submit to the
16 Commission a written request for a waiver of the 5-year period specified in sub-

40 in any schedule, including, without limitation, changes that will result in a
41 discontinuance, modification or restriction of service, the Commission shall
42 investigate the propriety of the proposed changes to determine whether to approve
43 or disapprove the proposed changes. If an electric utility files such an application
44 and the application is a general rate application or an annual deferred energy
45 accounting adjustment application, the Consumer’s Advocate shall be deemed a
46 party of record.
47 2. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3, if a public utility files with
48 the Commission an application to make changes in any schedule, the Commission

53 results of revenues, expenses, investments and costs of capital for its most recent 12

Senate Amendment No. 244 to Senate Bill No. 417 Page 10
1 months for which data were available when the application was prepared. Except as
2 otherwise provided in subsection 4, in determining whether to approve or
3 disapprove any increased rates, the Commission shall consider evidence in support
4 of the increased rates based upon actual recorded results of operations for the same
5 12 months, adjusted for increased revenues, any increased investment in facilities,
6 increased expenses for depreciation, certain other operating expenses as approved
7 by the Commission and changes in the costs of securities which are known and are
8 measurable with reasonable accuracy at the time of filing and which will become
9 effective within 6 months after the last month of those 12 months, but the public
10 utility shall not place into effect any increased rates until the changes have been
11 experienced and certified by the public utility to the Commission and the
12 Commission has approved the increased rates. The Commission shall also consider
13 evidence supporting expenses for depreciation, calculated on an annual basis,
14 applicable to major components of the public utility’s plant placed into service
15 during the recorded test period or the period for certification as set forth in the
16 application. Adjustments to revenues, operating expenses and costs of securities
17 must be calculated on an annual basis. Within 90 days after the date on which the
18 certification required by this subsection is filed with the Commission, or within the
19 period set forth in subsection 2, whichever time is longer, the Commission shall
20 make such order in reference to the increased rates as is required by this chapter.
21 The following public utilities shall each file a general rate application pursuant to
22 this subsection based on the following schedule:
23 (a) An electric utility that primarily serves less densely populated counties
24 shall file a general rate application:
25 (1) Not later than 5 p.m. on or before the first Monday in June 2019; and

36 purposes or services for the disposal of sewage, or both, which had an annual gross
37 operating revenue of $2,000,000 or more for at least 1 year during the immediately
38 preceding 3 years and which had not filed a general rate application with the
39 Commission on or after July 1, 2005, shall file a general rate application on or
40 before June 30, 2008, and at least once every 36 months thereafter unless waived by
41 the Commission pursuant to standards adopted by regulation of the Commission. If
42 a public utility furnishes both water and services for the disposal of sewage, its
43 annual gross operating revenue for each service must be considered separately for
44 determining whether the public utility meets the requirements of this paragraph for
45 either service.
46 (d) A public utility that furnishes water for municipal, industrial or domestic
47 purposes or services for the disposal of sewage, or both, which had an annual gross
48 operating revenue of $2,000,000 or more for at least 1 year during the immediately
49 preceding 3 years and which had filed a general rate application with the
50 Commission on or after July 1, 2005, shall file a general rate application on or

Senate Amendment No. 244 to Senate Bill No. 417 Page 11
1 annual gross operating revenue for each service must be considered separately for
2 determining whether the public utility meets the requirements of this paragraph for
3 either service.
4  The Commission shall adopt regulations setting forth standards for waivers
5 pursuant to paragraphs (c) and (d) and for including the costs incurred by the public
6 utility in preparing and presenting the general rate application before the effective
7 date of any change in rates.
8 4. In addition to submitting the statement required pursuant to subsection 3, a
9 public utility may submit with its general rate application a statement showing the
10 effects, on an annualized basis, of all expected changes in circumstances. If such a
11 statement is filed, it must include all increases and decreases in revenue and
12 expenses which may occur within 210 days after the date on which its general rate
13 application is filed with the Commission if such expected changes in circumstances
14 are reasonably known and are measurable with reasonable accuracy. If a public
15 utility submits such a statement, the public utility has the burden of proving that the
16 expected changes in circumstances set forth in the statement are reasonably known
17 and are measurable with reasonable accuracy. The Commission shall consider
18 expected changes in circumstances to be reasonably known and measurable with
19 reasonable accuracy if the expected changes in circumstances consist of specific
20 and identifiable events or programs rather than general trends, patterns or
21 developments, have an objectively high probability of occurring to the degree, in
22 the amount and at the time expected, are primarily measurable by recorded or
23 verifiable revenues and expenses and are easily and objectively calculated, with the
24 calculation of the expected changes relying only secondarily on estimates,
25 forecasts, projections or budgets. If the Commission determines that the public
26 utility has met its burden of proof:
27 (a) The Commission shall consider the statement submitted pursuant to this
28 subsection and evidence relevant to the statement, including all reasonable
29 projected or forecasted offsets in revenue and expenses that are directly attributable
30 to or associated with the expected changes in circumstances under consideration, in
31 addition to the statement required pursuant to subsection 3 as evidence in
32 establishing just and reasonable rates for the public utility; and
33 (b) The public utility is not required to file with the Commission the
34 certification that would otherwise be required pursuant to subsection 3.
35 5. If a public utility files with the Commission an application to make changes
36 in any schedule and the Commission does not issue a final written order regarding
37 the proposed changes within the time required by this section, the proposed changes
38 shall be deemed to be approved by the Commission.
39 6. If a public utility files with the Commission a general rate application, the
40 public utility, or a public utility affiliated with the public utility through common
41 ownership, shall not file with the Commission another general rate application until
42 all pending general rate applications filed by that public utility have been decided
43 by the Commission unless, after application and hearing, the Commission
44 determines that a substantial financial emergency would exist if the public utility or
45 its affiliate is not permitted to file another general rate application sooner. The
46 provisions of this subsection do not prohibit a public utility from filing with the
47 Commission, while a general rate application is pending, an application to recover
48 the increased cost of purchased fuel, purchased power, or natural gas purchased for
49 resale pursuant to subsection 7, a quarterly rate adjustment pursuant to subsection 8
50 or 10, any information relating to deferred accounting requirements pursuant to
51 NRS 704.185 or an annual deferred energy accounting adjustment application
52 pursuant to NRS 704.187, if the public utility is otherwise authorized to so file by
53 those provisions.

Senate Amendment No. 244 to Senate Bill No. 417 Page 12
1 7. A public utility may file an application to recover the increased cost of
2 purchased fuel, purchased power, or natural gas purchased for resale once every 30
3 days. The provisions of this subsection do not apply to:
4 (a) An electric utility which is required to adjust its rates on a quarterly basis
5 pursuant to subsection 10; or
6 (b) A public utility which purchases natural gas for resale and which adjusts its
7 rates on a quarterly basis pursuant to subsection 8.
8 8. A public utility which purchases natural gas for resale must request
9 approval from the Commission to adjust its rates on a quarterly basis between
10 annual rate adjustment applications based on changes in the public utility’s
11 recorded costs of natural gas purchased for resale. A public utility which purchases
12 natural gas for resale and which adjusts its rates on a quarterly basis may request
13 approval from the Commission to make quarterly adjustments to its deferred energy
14 accounting adjustment. The Commission shall approve or deny such a request not
15 later than 120 days after the application is filed with the Commission. The
16 Commission may approve the request if the Commission finds that approval of the
17 request is in the public interest. If the Commission approves a request to make
18 quarterly adjustments to the deferred energy accounting adjustment of a public
19 utility pursuant to this subsection, any quarterly adjustment to the deferred energy
20 accounting adjustment must not exceed 2.5 cents per therm of natural gas. If the
21 balance of the public utility’s deferred account varies by less than 5 percent from
22 the public utility’s annual recorded costs of natural gas which are used to calculate
23 quarterly rate adjustments, the deferred energy accounting adjustment must be set
24 to zero cents per therm of natural gas.
25 9. If the Commission approves a request to make any rate adjustments on a
26 quarterly basis pursuant to subsection 8:
27 (a) The public utility shall file written notice with the Commission before the
28 public utility makes a quarterly rate adjustment. A quarterly rate adjustment is not
29 subject to the requirements for notice and a hearing pursuant to NRS 703.320 or the
30 requirements for a consumer session pursuant to subsection 1 of NRS 704.069.
31 (b) The public utility shall provide written notice of each quarterly rate
32 adjustment to its customers by including the written notice with a customer’s
33 regular monthly bill or by electronic transmission pursuant to NRS 704.188. The
34 public utility shall begin providing such written notice to its customers not later
35 than 30 days after the date on which the public utility files its written notice with
36 the Commission pursuant to paragraph (a). The written notice required by this
37 paragraph:
38 (1) Must be printed separately, if included with the customer’s regular
39 monthly bill, or the subject line of the electronic transmission must indicate that
40 notice of a quarterly rate adjustment is included, if provided by electronic
41 transmission pursuant to NRS 704.188; and
42 (2) Must include the following in clear and bold text:
43 (I) The total amount of the increase or decrease in the public utility’s
44 revenues from the rate adjustment, stated in dollars and as a percentage;
45 (II) The amount of the monthly increase or decrease in charges for
46 each class of customer or class of service, stated in dollars and as a percentage;
47 (III) A statement that customers may send written comments or
48 protests regarding the rate adjustment to the Commission;
49 (IV) A statement that the transactions and recorded costs of natural gas
50 which are the basis for any quarterly rate adjustment will be reviewed for
51 reasonableness and prudence in the next proceeding held by the Commission to
52 review the annual rate adjustment application pursuant to paragraph (d); and
53 (V) Any other information required by the Commission.

Senate Amendment No. 244 to Senate Bill No. 417 Page 13
1 (c) The public utility shall file an annual rate adjustment application with the
2 Commission. The annual rate adjustment application is subject to the requirements
3 for notice and a hearing pursuant to NRS 703.320 and the requirements for a
4 consumer session pursuant to subsection 1 of NRS 704.069.
5 (d) The proceeding regarding the annual rate adjustment application must
6 include a review of each quarterly rate adjustment and the transactions and recorded
7 costs of natural gas included in each quarterly filing and the annual rate adjustment
8 application. There is no presumption of reasonableness or prudence for any
9 quarterly rate adjustment or for any transactions or recorded costs of natural gas
10 included in any quarterly rate adjustment or the annual rate adjustment application,
11 and the public utility has the burden of proving reasonableness and prudence in the
12 proceeding.
13 (e) The Commission shall not allow the public utility to recover any recorded
14 costs of natural gas which were the result of any practice or transaction that was
15 unreasonable or was undertaken, managed or performed imprudently by the public
16 utility, and the Commission shall order the public utility to adjust its rates if the
17 Commission determines that any recorded costs of natural gas included in any
18 quarterly rate adjustment or the annual rate adjustment application were not
19 reasonable or prudent.
20 10. An electric utility shall adjust its rates on a quarterly basis based on
21 changes in the electric utility’s recorded costs of purchased fuel or purchased
22 power. In addition to adjusting its rates on a quarterly basis, an electric utility may
23 request approval from the Commission to make quarterly adjustments to its
24 deferred energy accounting adjustment. The Commission shall approve or deny
25 such a request not later than 120 days after the application is filed with the
26 Commission. The Commission may approve the request if the Commission finds
27 that approval of the request is in the public interest. If the Commission approves a
28 request to make quarterly adjustments to the deferred energy accounting adjustment
29 of an electric utility pursuant to this subsection, any quarterly adjustment to the
30 deferred energy accounting adjustment must not exceed 0.25 cents per kilowatt-
31 hour of electricity. If the balance of the electric utility’s deferred account varies by
32 less than 5 percent from the electric utility’s annual recorded costs for purchased
33 fuel or purchased power which are used to calculate quarterly rate adjustments, the
34 deferred energy accounting adjustment must be set to zero cents per kilowatt-hour
35 of electricity.
36 11. A quarterly rate adjustment filed pursuant to subsection 10 is subject to
37 the following requirements:
38 (a) The electric utility shall file written notice with the Commission on or
39 before August 15, 2007, and every quarter thereafter of the quarterly rate
40 adjustment to be made by the electric utility for the following quarter. The first
41 quarterly rate adjustment by the electric utility will take effect on October 1, 2007,
42 and each subsequent quarterly rate adjustment will take effect every quarter
43 thereafter. The first quarterly adjustment to a deferred energy accounting
44 adjustment must be made pursuant to an order issued by the Commission approving
45 the application of an electric utility to make quarterly adjustments to its deferred
46 energy accounting adjustment. A quarterly rate adjustment is not subject to the
47 requirements for notice and a hearing pursuant to NRS 703.320 or the requirements
48 for a consumer session pursuant to subsection 1 of NRS 704.069.
49 (b) The electric utility shall provide written notice of each quarterly rate
50 adjustment to its customers by including the written notice with a customer’s
51 regular monthly bill or by electronic submission pursuant to NRS 704.188. The
52 electric utility shall begin providing such written notice to its customers not later
53 than 30 days after the date on which the electric utility files a written notice with

Senate Amendment No. 244 to Senate Bill No. 417 Page 14
1 the Commission pursuant to paragraph (a). The written notice required by this
2 paragraph:
3 (1) Must be printed separately, if included with the customer’s regular
4 monthly bill, or the subject line of the electronic transmission must indicate that
5 notice of a quarterly rate adjustment is included, if provided by electronic
6 transmission pursuant to NRS 704.188; and
7 (2) Must include the following in clear and bold text:
8 (I) The total amount of the increase or decrease in the electric utility’s
9 revenues from the rate adjustment, stated in dollars and as a percentage;
10 (II) The amount of the monthly increase or decrease in charges for
11 each class of customer or class of service, stated in dollars and as a percentage;
12 (III) A statement that customers may send written comments or
13 protests regarding the rate adjustment to the Commission;
14 (IV) A statement that the transactions and recorded costs of purchased
15 fuel or purchased power which are the basis for any quarterly rate adjustment will
16 be reviewed for reasonableness and prudence in the next proceeding held by the
17 Commission to review the annual deferred energy accounting adjustment
18 application pursuant to paragraph (d); and
19 (V) Any other information required by the Commission.
20 (c) The electric utility shall file an annual deferred energy accounting
21 adjustment application pursuant to NRS 704.187 with the Commission. The annual
22 deferred energy accounting adjustment application is subject to the requirements for
23 notice and a hearing pursuant to NRS 703.320 and the requirements for a consumer
24 session pursuant to subsection 1 of NRS 704.069.
25 (d) The proceeding regarding the annual deferred energy accounting
26 adjustment application must include a review of each quarterly rate adjustment and
27 the transactions and recorded costs of purchased fuel and purchased power included
28 in each quarterly filing and the annual deferred energy accounting adjustment
29 application. There is no presumption of reasonableness or prudence for any
30 quarterly rate adjustment or for any transactions or recorded costs of purchased fuel
31 and purchased power included in any quarterly rate adjustment or the annual
32 deferred energy accounting adjustment application, and the electric utility has the
33 burden of proving reasonableness and prudence in the proceeding.
34 (e) The Commission shall not allow the electric utility to recover any recorded
35 costs of purchased fuel and purchased power which were the result of any practice
36 or transaction that was unreasonable or was undertaken, managed or performed
37 imprudently by the electric utility, and the Commission shall order the electric
38 utility to adjust its rates if the Commission determines that any recorded costs of
39 purchased fuel and purchased power included in any quarterly rate adjustment or
40 the annual deferred energy accounting adjustment application were not reasonable
41 or prudent.
42 12. If an electric utility files an annual deferred energy accounting adjustment
43 application pursuant to subsection 11 and NRS 704.187 while a general rate
44 application is pending, the electric utility shall:
45 (a) Submit with its annual deferred energy accounting adjustment application
46 information relating to the cost of service and rate design; and
47 (b) Supplement its general rate application with the same information, if such
48 information was not submitted with the general rate application.
49 13. A utility facility identified in a 3-year plan submitted pursuant to NRS
50 704.741 and accepted by the Commission for acquisition or construction pursuant
51 to NRS 704.751 and the regulations adopted pursuant thereto, or the retirement or
52 elimination of a utility facility identified in an emissions reduction and capacity
53 replacement plan submitted pursuant to NRS 704.7316 and accepted by the

Senate Amendment No. 244 to Senate Bill No. 417 Page 15
1 Commission for retirement or elimination pursuant to NRS 704.751 and the
2 regulations adopted pursuant thereto, shall be deemed to be a prudent investment.
3 The utility may recover all just and reasonable costs of planning and constructing,
4 or retiring or eliminating, as applicable, such a facility. For the purposes of this
5 subsection, a plan or an amendment to a plan shall be deemed to be accepted by the
6 Commission only as to that portion of the plan or amendment accepted as filed or
7 modified with the consent of the utility pursuant to NRS 704.751.
8 14. In regard to any rate or schedule approved or disapproved pursuant to this
9 section, the Commission may, after a hearing:
10 (a) Upon the request of the utility, approve a new rate but delay the
11 implementation of that new rate:
12 (1) Until a date determined by the Commission; and
13 (2) Under conditions as determined by the Commission, including, without
14 limitation, a requirement that interest charges be included in the collection of the
15 new rate; and
16 (b) Authorize a utility to implement a reduced rate for low-income residential
17 customers.
18 15. The Commission may, upon request and for good cause shown, permit a
19 public utility which purchases natural gas for resale or an electric utility to make a
20 quarterly adjustment to its deferred energy accounting adjustment in excess of the
21 maximum allowable adjustment pursuant to subsection 8 or 10.
22 16. A public utility which purchases natural gas for resale or an electric utility
23 that makes quarterly adjustments to its deferred energy accounting adjustment
24 pursuant to subsection 8 or 10 may submit to the Commission for approval an
25 application to discontinue making quarterly adjustments to its deferred energy
26 accounting adjustment and to subsequently make annual adjustments to its deferred
27 energy accounting adjustment. The Commission may approve an application
28 submitted pursuant to this subsection if the Commission finds that approval of the
29 application is in the public interest.
30 17. As used in this section:
31 (a) “Deferred energy accounting adjustment” means the rate of a public utility
32 which purchases natural gas for resale or an electric utility that is calculated by
33 dividing the balance of a deferred account during a specified period by the total
34 therms or kilowatt-hours which have been sold in the geographical area to which
35 the rate applies during the specified period, not including kilowatt-hours sold
36 pursuant to an expanded solar access program established pursuant to NRS
37 704.7865.
38 (b) “Electric utility” has the meaning ascribed to it in NRS 704.187.
39 (c) “Electric utility that primarily serves densely populated counties” means an
40 electric utility that, with regard to the provision of electric service, derives more of
41 its annual gross operating revenue in this State from customers located in counties
42 whose population is 700,000 or more than it does from customers located in
43 counties whose population is less than 700,000.
44 (d) “Electric utility that primarily serves less densely populated counties”
45 means an electric utility that, with regard to the provision of electric service,
46 derives more of its annual gross operating revenue in this State from customers
47 located in counties whose population is less than 700,000 than it does from
48 customers located in counties whose population is 700,000 or more.
