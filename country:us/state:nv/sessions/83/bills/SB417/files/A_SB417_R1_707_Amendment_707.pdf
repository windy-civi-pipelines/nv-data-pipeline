AN ACT relating to [natural gas] public utilities; requiring the Public Utilities
Commission of Nevada to adopt regulations governing the filing of an
application for the establishment of an alternative rate-making plan by
a natural gas utility; setting forth certain requirements for the
submission and approval of such an alternative rate-making plan;
revising certain provisions relating to the application and approval
for an alternative rate-making plan by an electric utility; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth certain procedures for a public utility to make changes to a general
2 rate schedule by applying to Public Utilities Commission of Nevada. (NRS 704.100, 704.110)
3 Section 11 of this bill requires the Commission to adopt regulations establishing procedures
4 for a natural gas utility to apply to the Commission for the approval of an alternative rate-
5 making plan, which establishes the alternative rate-making mechanisms that the natural gas
6 utility is authorized to use to set rates during the time period of the plan. The regulations
7 adopted by the Commission must: (1) establish the alternative rate-making mechanisms that
8 may be included in a plan and any limitations on such alternative rate-making mechanisms;
9 (2) prescribe the information that must be included in an alternative rate-making plan and an
10 application for the approval of such a plan; (3) specify the circumstances under which a
11 natural gas utility for which an alternative rate-making plan has been approved must file a
12 general rate application; (4) provide a process to educate customers of a natural gas utility
13 regarding alternative rate-making mechanisms; (5) require a natural gas utility for which an
14 alternative rate-making plan has been approved to keep certain records; and (6) establish
15 criteria for the evaluation of an alternative rate-making plan. Additionally, section 11
16 [authorizes the Commission to adopt regulations to establish one or more methods to establish
17 a formula for a] requires that, if a natural gas utility files an application for an alternative
18 rate-making plan that includes formula [rate.] rates or a multi-year rate plan, the
19 alternative rate-making plan must include: (1) an earnings-sharing mechanism; and (2)
20 certain information and calculations relating to changes in risk to the natural gas utility.
21 Section 12 of this bill authorizes a natural gas utility to submit an application to establish
22 an alternative rate-making plan pursuant to the regulations adopted by the Commission,
23 establishes time limits for the Commission to approve or deny such an application and
24 requires the Commission to conduct a consumer session in each major geographic area in

Assembly Amendment No. 707 to Senate Bill No. 417 First Reprint Page 4
25 which the natural gas utility provides services before taking action on such an application.
26 Section 12 requires an application for the approval of an alternative rate-making plan to
27 include a plan to educate the customers of the natural gas utility regarding the alternative rate-
28 making mechanisms in the plan proposed by the utility. Section 12 prohibits the Commission
29 from approving an alternative rate-making plan unless the Commission determines that the
30 plan meets certain requirements. Section 12 also authorizes an alternative rate-making plan to
31 include certain provisions, including, without limitation, a mechanism for earnings-sharing
32 with the customers of the utility. Additionally, section 12 authorizes a natural gas utility to
33 reject an application for an alternative rate-making plan with modifications approved by the
34 Commission. Finally, section 12 authorizes the Commission to investigate and change rates,
35 tolls, charges, rules, regulations, practices and services relating to an alternative rate-making
36 plan under certain circumstances. Section 13 of this bill provides that the provisions of this
37 bill do not limit the existing rate-making authority of the Commission.
38 Sections 3-10 of this bill define certain terms relating to alternative rate-making plans.
39 Sections 14 and 15 of this bill create exceptions from the procedure set forth in existing
40 law to change a general rate schedule to authorize a natural gas utility to file an application to
41 establish an alternative rate-making plan pursuant to section 12.
42 Existing law requires the Commission to adopt regulations to establish procedures
43 for an electric utility to apply to the Commission for the approval of an alternative rate-
44 making plan. (NRS 704.762) Section 16 of this bill requires that, if an electric utility files
45 an application for an alternative rate-making plan that includes formula rates or a
46 multi-year rate plan, the alternative rate-making plan must include: (1) an earnings-
47 sharing mechanism; and (2) certain information and calculations relating to changes in
48 risk to the electric utility.
49 Existing law authorizes an electric utility to apply to the Commission to establish an
50 alternative rate-making plan and sets forth certain requirements relating to the
51 approval of the plan by the Commission. (NRS 704.7621) Section 17 of this bill requires
52 that, if the Commission approves an application for an alternative rate-making plan that
53 authorizes the recovery of the costs of a capital expenditure: (1) the electric utility must
54 prove the capital expenditure was prudent; and (2) if the Commission determines that
55 the electric utility did not prove the capital expenditure was prudent, the Commission
56 shall require the electric utility to refund the costs of the capital expenditure charged to
57 the customers of the electric utility.

43 increased expenses for depreciation, certain other operating expenses as approved
44 by the Commission and changes in the costs of securities which are known and are
45 measurable with reasonable accuracy at the time of filing and which will become
46 effective within 6 months after the last month of those 12 months, but the public
47 utility shall not place into effect any increased rates until the changes have been
48 experienced and certified by the public utility to the Commission and the
49 Commission has approved the increased rates. The Commission shall also consider
50 evidence supporting expenses for depreciation, calculated on an annual basis,
51 applicable to major components of the public utility’s plant placed into service
52 during the recorded test period or the period for certification as set forth in the
53 application. Adjustments to revenues, operating expenses and costs of securities

Assembly Amendment No. 707 to Senate Bill No. 417 First Reprint Page 11
1 must be calculated on an annual basis. Within 90 days after the date on which the
2 certification required by this subsection is filed with the Commission, or within the
3 period set forth in subsection 2, whichever time is longer, the Commission shall
4 make such order in reference to the increased rates as is required by this chapter.
5 The following public utilities shall each file a general rate application pursuant to
6 this subsection based on the following schedule:
7 (a) An electric utility that primarily serves less densely populated counties
8 shall file a general rate application:
9 (1) Not later than 5 p.m. on or before the first Monday in June 2019; and
10 (2) At least once every 36 months thereafter or on a date specified in an
11 alternative rate-making plan approved by the Commission pursuant to NRS
12 704.7621.
13 (b) An electric utility that primarily serves densely populated counties shall file
14 a general rate application:
15 (1) Not later than 5 p.m. on or before the first Monday in June 2020; and
16 (2) At least once every 36 months thereafter or on a date specified in an
17 alternative rate-making plan approved by the Commission pursuant to NRS
18 704.7621.
19 (c) A public utility that furnishes water for municipal, industrial or domestic
20 purposes or services for the disposal of sewage, or both, which had an annual gross
21 operating revenue of $2,000,000 or more for at least 1 year during the immediately
22 preceding 3 years and which had not filed a general rate application with the
23 Commission on or after July 1, 2005, shall file a general rate application on or
24 before June 30, 2008, and at least once every 36 months thereafter unless waived by
25 the Commission pursuant to standards adopted by regulation of the Commission. If
26 a public utility furnishes both water and services for the disposal of sewage, its
27 annual gross operating revenue for each service must be considered separately for
28 determining whether the public utility meets the requirements of this paragraph for
29 either service.
30 (d) A public utility that furnishes water for municipal, industrial or domestic
31 purposes or services for the disposal of sewage, or both, which had an annual gross
32 operating revenue of $2,000,000 or more for at least 1 year during the immediately
33 preceding 3 years and which had filed a general rate application with the
34 Commission on or after July 1, 2005, shall file a general rate application on or
35 before June 30, 2009, and at least once every 36 months thereafter unless waived by
36 the Commission pursuant to standards adopted by regulation of the Commission. If
37 a public utility furnishes both water and services for the disposal of sewage, its
38 annual gross operating revenue for each service must be considered separately for
39 determining whether the public utility meets the requirements of this paragraph for
40 either service.
41  The Commission shall adopt regulations setting forth standards for waivers
42 pursuant to paragraphs (c) and (d) and for including the costs incurred by the public
43 utility in preparing and presenting the general rate application before the effective
44 date of any change in rates.
45 4. In addition to submitting the statement required pursuant to subsection 3, a
46 public utility may submit with its general rate application a statement showing the
47 effects, on an annualized basis, of all expected changes in circumstances. If such a
48 statement is filed, it must include all increases and decreases in revenue and
49 expenses which may occur within 210 days after the date on which its general rate
50 application is filed with the Commission if such expected changes in circumstances
51 are reasonably known and are measurable with reasonable accuracy. If a public
52 utility submits such a statement, the public utility has the burden of proving that the
53 expected changes in circumstances set forth in the statement are reasonably known

Assembly Amendment No. 707 to Senate Bill No. 417 First Reprint Page 12
1 and are measurable with reasonable accuracy. The Commission shall consider
2 expected changes in circumstances to be reasonably known and measurable with
3 reasonable accuracy if the expected changes in circumstances consist of specific
4 and identifiable events or programs rather than general trends, patterns or
5 developments, have an objectively high probability of occurring to the degree, in
6 the amount and at the time expected, are primarily measurable by recorded or
7 verifiable revenues and expenses and are easily and objectively calculated, with the
8 calculation of the expected changes relying only secondarily on estimates,
9 forecasts, projections or budgets. If the Commission determines that the public
10 utility has met its burden of proof:
11 (a) The Commission shall consider the statement submitted pursuant to this
12 subsection and evidence relevant to the statement, including all reasonable
13 projected or forecasted offsets in revenue and expenses that are directly attributable
14 to or associated with the expected changes in circumstances under consideration, in
15 addition to the statement required pursuant to subsection 3 as evidence in
16 establishing just and reasonable rates for the public utility; and
17 (b) The public utility is not required to file with the Commission the
18 certification that would otherwise be required pursuant to subsection 3.
19 5. If a public utility files with the Commission an application to make changes
20 in any schedule and the Commission does not issue a final written order regarding
21 the proposed changes within the time required by this section, the proposed changes
22 shall be deemed to be approved by the Commission.
23 6. If a public utility files with the Commission a general rate application, the
24 public utility, or a public utility affiliated with the public utility through common
25 ownership, shall not file with the Commission another general rate application until
26 all pending general rate applications filed by that public utility have been decided
27 by the Commission unless, after application and hearing, the Commission
28 determines that a substantial financial emergency would exist if the public utility or
29 its affiliate is not permitted to file another general rate application sooner. The
30 provisions of this subsection do not prohibit a public utility from filing with the
31 Commission, while a general rate application is pending, an application to recover
32 the increased cost of purchased fuel, purchased power, or natural gas purchased for
33 resale pursuant to subsection 7, a quarterly rate adjustment pursuant to subsection 8
34 or 10, any information relating to deferred accounting requirements pursuant to
35 NRS 704.185 or an annual deferred energy accounting adjustment application
36 pursuant to NRS 704.187, if the public utility is otherwise authorized to so file by
37 those provisions.
38 7. A public utility may file an application to recover the increased cost of
39 purchased fuel, purchased power, or natural gas purchased for resale once every 30
40 days. The provisions of this subsection do not apply to:
41 (a) An electric utility which is required to adjust its rates on a quarterly basis
42 pursuant to subsection 10; or
43 (b) A public utility which purchases natural gas for resale and which adjusts its
44 rates on a quarterly basis pursuant to subsection 8.
45 8. A public utility which purchases natural gas for resale must request
46 approval from the Commission to adjust its rates on a quarterly basis between
47 annual rate adjustment applications based on changes in the public utility’s
48 recorded costs of natural gas purchased for resale. A public utility which purchases
49 natural gas for resale and which adjusts its rates on a quarterly basis may request
50 approval from the Commission to make quarterly adjustments to its deferred energy
51 accounting adjustment. The Commission shall approve or deny such a request not
52 later than 120 days after the application is filed with the Commission. The
53 Commission may approve the request if the Commission finds that approval of the

Assembly Amendment No. 707 to Senate Bill No. 417 First Reprint Page 13
1 request is in the public interest. If the Commission approves a request to make
2 quarterly adjustments to the deferred energy accounting adjustment of a public
3 utility pursuant to this subsection, any quarterly adjustment to the deferred energy
4 accounting adjustment must not exceed 2.5 cents per therm of natural gas. If the
5 balance of the public utility’s deferred account varies by less than 5 percent from
6 the public utility’s annual recorded costs of natural gas which are used to calculate
7 quarterly rate adjustments, the deferred energy accounting adjustment must be set
8 to zero cents per therm of natural gas.
9 9. If the Commission approves a request to make any rate adjustments on a
10 quarterly basis pursuant to subsection 8:
11 (a) The public utility shall file written notice with the Commission before the
12 public utility makes a quarterly rate adjustment. A quarterly rate adjustment is not
13 subject to the requirements for notice and a hearing pursuant to NRS 703.320 or the
14 requirements for a consumer session pursuant to subsection 1 of NRS 704.069.
15 (b) The public utility shall provide written notice of each quarterly rate
16 adjustment to its customers by including the written notice with a customer’s
17 regular monthly bill or by electronic transmission pursuant to NRS 704.188. The
18 public utility shall begin providing such written notice to its customers not later
19 than 30 days after the date on which the public utility files its written notice with
20 the Commission pursuant to paragraph (a). The written notice required by this
21 paragraph:
22 (1) Must be printed separately, if included with the customer’s regular
23 monthly bill, or the subject line of the electronic transmission must indicate that
24 notice of a quarterly rate adjustment is included, if provided by electronic
25 transmission pursuant to NRS 704.188; and
26 (2) Must include the following in clear and bold text:
27 (I) The total amount of the increase or decrease in the public utility’s
28 revenues from the rate adjustment, stated in dollars and as a percentage;
29 (II) The amount of the monthly increase or decrease in charges for
30 each class of customer or class of service, stated in dollars and as a percentage;
31 (III) A statement that customers may send written comments or
32 protests regarding the rate adjustment to the Commission;
33 (IV) A statement that the transactions and recorded costs of natural gas
34 which are the basis for any quarterly rate adjustment will be reviewed for
35 reasonableness and prudence in the next proceeding held by the Commission to
36 review the annual rate adjustment application pursuant to paragraph (d); and
37 (V) Any other information required by the Commission.
38 (c) The public utility shall file an annual rate adjustment application with the
39 Commission. The annual rate adjustment application is subject to the requirements
40 for notice and a hearing pursuant to NRS 703.320 and the requirements for a
41 consumer session pursuant to subsection 1 of NRS 704.069.
42 (d) The proceeding regarding the annual rate adjustment application must
43 include a review of each quarterly rate adjustment and the transactions and recorded
44 costs of natural gas included in each quarterly filing and the annual rate adjustment
45 application. There is no presumption of reasonableness or prudence for any
46 quarterly rate adjustment or for any transactions or recorded costs of natural gas
47 included in any quarterly rate adjustment or the annual rate adjustment application,
48 and the public utility has the burden of proving reasonableness and prudence in the
49 proceeding.
50 (e) The Commission shall not allow the public utility to recover any recorded
51 costs of natural gas which were the result of any practice or transaction that was
52 unreasonable or was undertaken, managed or performed imprudently by the public
53 utility, and the Commission shall order the public utility to adjust its rates if the

Assembly Amendment No. 707 to Senate Bill No. 417 First Reprint Page 14
1 Commission determines that any recorded costs of natural gas included in any
2 quarterly rate adjustment or the annual rate adjustment application were not
3 reasonable or prudent.
4 10. An electric utility shall adjust its rates on a quarterly basis based on
5 changes in the electric utility’s recorded costs of purchased fuel or purchased
6 power. In addition to adjusting its rates on a quarterly basis, an electric utility may
7 request approval from the Commission to make quarterly adjustments to its
8 deferred energy accounting adjustment. The Commission shall approve or deny
9 such a request not later than 120 days after the application is filed with the
10 Commission. The Commission may approve the request if the Commission finds
11 that approval of the request is in the public interest. If the Commission approves a
12 request to make quarterly adjustments to the deferred energy accounting adjustment
13 of an electric utility pursuant to this subsection, any quarterly adjustment to the
14 deferred energy accounting adjustment must not exceed 0.25 cents per kilowatt-
15 hour of electricity. If the balance of the electric utility’s deferred account varies by
16 less than 5 percent from the electric utility’s annual recorded costs for purchased
17 fuel or purchased power which are used to calculate quarterly rate adjustments, the
18 deferred energy accounting adjustment must be set to zero cents per kilowatt-hour
19 of electricity.
20 11. A quarterly rate adjustment filed pursuant to subsection 10 is subject to
21 the following requirements:
22 (a) The electric utility shall file written notice with the Commission on or
23 before August 15, 2007, and every quarter thereafter of the quarterly rate
24 adjustment to be made by the electric utility for the following quarter. The first
25 quarterly rate adjustment by the electric utility will take effect on October 1, 2007,
26 and each subsequent quarterly rate adjustment will take effect every quarter
27 thereafter. The first quarterly adjustment to a deferred energy accounting
28 adjustment must be made pursuant to an order issued by the Commission approving
29 the application of an electric utility to make quarterly adjustments to its deferred
30 energy accounting adjustment. A quarterly rate adjustment is not subject to the
31 requirements for notice and a hearing pursuant to NRS 703.320 or the requirements
32 for a consumer session pursuant to subsection 1 of NRS 704.069.
33 (b) The electric utility shall provide written notice of each quarterly rate
34 adjustment to its customers by including the written notice with a customer’s
35 regular monthly bill or by electronic submission pursuant to NRS 704.188. The
36 electric utility shall begin providing such written notice to its customers not later
37 than 30 days after the date on which the electric utility files a written notice with
38 the Commission pursuant to paragraph (a). The written notice required by this
39 paragraph:
40 (1) Must be printed separately, if included with the customer’s regular
41 monthly bill, or the subject line of the electronic transmission must indicate that
42 notice of a quarterly rate adjustment is included, if provided by electronic
43 transmission pursuant to NRS 704.188; and
44 (2) Must include the following in clear and bold text:
45 (I) The total amount of the increase or decrease in the electric utility’s
46 revenues from the rate adjustment, stated in dollars and as a percentage;
47 (II) The amount of the monthly increase or decrease in charges for
48 each class of customer or class of service, stated in dollars and as a percentage;
49 (III) A statement that customers may send written comments or
50 protests regarding the rate adjustment to the Commission;
51 (IV) A statement that the transactions and recorded costs of purchased
52 fuel or purchased power which are the basis for any quarterly rate adjustment will
53 be reviewed for reasonableness and prudence in the next proceeding held by the

Assembly Amendment No. 707 to Senate Bill No. 417 First Reprint Page 15
1 Commission to review the annual deferred energy accounting adjustment
2 application pursuant to paragraph (d); and
3 (V) Any other information required by the Commission.
4 (c) The electric utility shall file an annual deferred energy accounting
5 adjustment application pursuant to NRS 704.187 with the Commission. The annual
6 deferred energy accounting adjustment application is subject to the requirements for
7 notice and a hearing pursuant to NRS 703.320 and the requirements for a consumer
8 session pursuant to subsection 1 of NRS 704.069.
9 (d) The proceeding regarding the annual deferred energy accounting
10 adjustment application must include a review of each quarterly rate adjustment and
11 the transactions and recorded costs of purchased fuel and purchased power included
12 in each quarterly filing and the annual deferred energy accounting adjustment
13 application. There is no presumption of reasonableness or prudence for any
14 quarterly rate adjustment or for any transactions or recorded costs of purchased fuel
15 and purchased power included in any quarterly rate adjustment or the annual
16 deferred energy accounting adjustment application, and the electric utility has the
17 burden of proving reasonableness and prudence in the proceeding.
18 (e) The Commission shall not allow the electric utility to recover any recorded
19 costs of purchased fuel and purchased power which were the result of any practice
20 or transaction that was unreasonable or was undertaken, managed or performed
21 imprudently by the electric utility, and the Commission shall order the electric
22 utility to adjust its rates if the Commission determines that any recorded costs of
23 purchased fuel and purchased power included in any quarterly rate adjustment or
24 the annual deferred energy accounting adjustment application were not reasonable
25 or prudent.
26 12. If an electric utility files an annual deferred energy accounting adjustment
27 application pursuant to subsection 11 and NRS 704.187 while a general rate
28 application is pending, the electric utility shall:
29 (a) Submit with its annual deferred energy accounting adjustment application
30 information relating to the cost of service and rate design; and
31 (b) Supplement its general rate application with the same information, if such
32 information was not submitted with the general rate application.
33 13. A utility facility identified in a 3-year plan submitted pursuant to NRS
34 704.741 and accepted by the Commission for acquisition or construction pursuant
35 to NRS 704.751 and the regulations adopted pursuant thereto, or the retirement or
36 elimination of a utility facility identified in an emissions reduction and capacity
37 replacement plan submitted pursuant to NRS 704.7316 and accepted by the
38 Commission for retirement or elimination pursuant to NRS 704.751 and the
39 regulations adopted pursuant thereto, shall be deemed to be a prudent investment.
40 The utility may recover all just and reasonable costs of planning and constructing,
41 or retiring or eliminating, as applicable, such a facility. For the purposes of this
42 subsection, a plan or an amendment to a plan shall be deemed to be accepted by the
43 Commission only as to that portion of the plan or amendment accepted as filed or
44 modified with the consent of the utility pursuant to NRS 704.751.
45 14. In regard to any rate or schedule approved or disapproved pursuant to this
46 section, the Commission may, after a hearing:
47 (a) Upon the request of the utility, approve a new rate but delay the
48 implementation of that new rate:
49 (1) Until a date determined by the Commission; and
50 (2) Under conditions as determined by the Commission, including, without
51 limitation, a requirement that interest charges be included in the collection of the
52 new rate; and

Assembly Amendment No. 707 to Senate Bill No. 417 First Reprint Page 16
1 (b) Authorize a utility to implement a reduced rate for low-income residential
2 customers.
3 15. The Commission may, upon request and for good cause shown, permit a
4 public utility which purchases natural gas for resale or an electric utility to make a
5 quarterly adjustment to its deferred energy accounting adjustment in excess of the
6 maximum allowable adjustment pursuant to subsection 8 or 10.
7 16. A public utility which purchases natural gas for resale or an electric utility
8 that makes quarterly adjustments to its deferred energy accounting adjustment
9 pursuant to subsection 8 or 10 may submit to the Commission for approval an
10 application to discontinue making quarterly adjustments to its deferred energy
11 accounting adjustment and to subsequently make annual adjustments to its deferred
12 energy accounting adjustment. The Commission may approve an application
13 submitted pursuant to this subsection if the Commission finds that approval of the
14 application is in the public interest.
15 17. As used in this section:
16 (a) “Deferred energy accounting adjustment” means the rate of a public utility
17 which purchases natural gas for resale or an electric utility that is calculated by
18 dividing the balance of a deferred account during a specified period by the total
19 therms or kilowatt-hours which have been sold in the geographical area to which
20 the rate applies during the specified period, not including kilowatt-hours sold
21 pursuant to an expanded solar access program established pursuant to NRS
22 704.7865.
23 (b) “Electric utility” has the meaning ascribed to it in NRS 704.187.
24 (c) “Electric utility that primarily serves densely populated counties” means an
25 electric utility that, with regard to the provision of electric service, derives more of
26 its annual gross operating revenue in this State from customers located in counties
27 whose population is 700,000 or more than it does from customers located in
28 counties whose population is less than 700,000.
29 (d) “Electric utility that primarily serves less densely populated counties”
30 means an electric utility that, with regard to the provision of electric service,
31 derives more of its annual gross operating revenue in this State from customers
32 located in counties whose population is less than 700,000 than it does from
33 customers located in counties whose population is 700,000 or more.
34 Sec. 16. NRS 704.762 is hereby amended to read as follows:
35 704.762 1. The Commission shall adopt regulations to establish procedures
36 for an electric utility to apply to the Commission for the approval of an alternative
37 rate-making plan. The regulations must:
38 (a) Establish the alternative rate-making mechanisms that may be included in
39 such a plan and any limitations on such alternative rate-making mechanisms as the
40 Commission deems appropriate, including, without limitation, any restrictions on
41 the types of alternative rate-making mechanisms that may be used in concert within
42 the same alternative rate-making plan.
43 (b) Provide the information that must be included in an alternative rate-making
44 plan and an application submitted pursuant to the regulations adopted pursuant to
45 this section.
46 (c) Specify the circumstances under which an electric utility for which the
47 Commission has approved an alternative rate-making plan is required to file a
48 general rate application pursuant to NRS 704.110 including, without limitation, if
49 the alternative rate-making plan ceases to meet the criteria established by the
50 Commission pursuant to paragraph (g).
51 (d) Provide a process to educate customers of an electric utility regarding the
52 available alternative rate-making mechanisms that may be included in an alternative
53 rate-making plan.

1 (e) Establish requirements for an electric utility for which the Commission has
2 approved an alternative rate-making plan to keep or cause to be kept any
3 information and records which the utility would have been required to submit to the
4 Commission as part of an application pursuant to NRS 704.110 or 704.187, if the
5 filing of any such application is delayed or excused pursuant to the alternative rate-
6 making plan.
7 (f) If the Commission determines that it is practicable, require an electric utility
8 to include in its application for the approval of an alternative rate-making plan:
9 (1) One or more cost of service studies.
10 (2) An analysis estimating and comparing:
11 (I) The rates that would be charged and the revenue that would be
12 collected under the alternative rate-making plan proposed in the application; and
13 (II) The rates that would be charged and the revenue that would be
14 collected pursuant to the rate-making process established by NRS 704.110.
15 (g) Establish criteria for the evaluation of an alternative rate-making plan

38 2. In addition to any requirement adopted by regulation of the Commission
39 pursuant to subsection 1, if an electric utility files an application for an
40 alternative rate-making plan that includes formula rates or a multi-year rate
41 plan, the alternative rate-making plan must include, without limitation:
42 (a) An earnings-sharing mechanism; and
43 (b) A discussion identifying any changes in risk to the electric utility and a
44 calculation to adjust the rate of return of the electric utility based on the changes

46 on the rates charged to customers of the electric utility.
47 3. The Commission is not required to accept applications to establish an
48 alternative rate-making plan if the Commission determines, after a reasonable
49 investigation, that the use of an alternative rate-making plan is not consistent with
50 the criteria established by the Commission pursuant to paragraph (g) of subsection

13 the plan.
14 2. The Commission shall approve, with or without modifications, or deny an
15 application submitted pursuant to subsection 1 not later than 210 days after the
16 Commission receives a copy of the application unless the Commission, upon good
17 cause, extends by not more than 90 days the time to act upon the application. If the
18 Commission fails to act upon an application within the time provided by this
19 subsection, the application shall be deemed to be denied.
20 3. The Commission shall conduct at least one consumer session pursuant to
21 NRS 704.069 to solicit comments from the public before taking action on an
22 application submitted pursuant to subsection 1.
23 4. The Commission shall not approve an application submitted pursuant to
24 subsection 1 unless the Commission determines that the plan:
25 (a) Is in the public interest;
26 (b) Results in just and reasonable rates, as determined by the Commission;
27 (c) Protects the interests of the customers of the electric utility;
28 (d) Satisfies the criteria established by the Commission pursuant to paragraph
