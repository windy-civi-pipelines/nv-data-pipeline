AN ACT relating to public utilities; requiring the Public Utilities
Commission of Nevada to adopt regulations governing
the filing of an application for the establishment of an
alternative rate-making plan by a natural gas utility;
setting forth certain requirements for the submission and
approval of such an alternative rate-making plan; revising
certain provisions relating to the application and approval
for an alternative rate-making plan by an electric utility;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth certain procedures for a public utility to make changes to
2 a general rate schedule by applying to Public Utilities Commission of Nevada.
3 (NRS 704.100, 704.110) Section 11 of this bill requires the Commission to adopt
4 regulations establishing procedures for a natural gas utility to apply to the
5 Commission for the approval of an alternative rate-making plan, which establishes
6 the alternative rate-making mechanisms that the natural gas utility is authorized to
7 use to set rates during the time period of the plan. The regulations adopted by the
8 Commission must: (1) establish the alternative rate-making mechanisms that may
9 be included in a plan and any limitations on such alternative rate-making
10 mechanisms; (2) prescribe the information that must be included in an alternative
11 rate-making plan and an application for the approval of such a plan; (3) specify the
12 circumstances under which a natural gas utility for which an alternative rate-
13 making plan has been approved must file a general rate application; (4) provide a
14 process to educate customers of a natural gas utility regarding alternative rate-
15 making mechanisms; (5) require a natural gas utility for which an alternative rate-
16 making plan has been approved to keep certain records; and (6) establish criteria for
17 the evaluation of an alternative rate-making plan. Additionally, section 11 requires
18 that, if a natural gas utility files an application for an alternative rate-making plan
-

19 that includes formula rates or a multi-year rate plan, the alternative rate-making
20 plan must include: (1) an earnings-sharing mechanism; and (2) certain information
21 and calculations relating to changes in risk to the natural gas utility.
22 Section 12 of this bill authorizes a natural gas utility to submit an application to
23 establish an alternative rate-making plan pursuant to the regulations adopted by the
24 Commission, establishes time limits for the Commission to approve or deny such
25 an application and requires the Commission to conduct a consumer session in each
26 major geographic area in which the natural gas utility provides services before
27 taking action on such an application. Section 12 requires an application for the
28 approval of an alternative rate-making plan to include a plan to educate the
29 customers of the natural gas utility regarding the alternative rate-making
30 mechanisms in the plan proposed by the utility. Section 12 prohibits the
31 Commission from approving an alternative rate-making plan unless the
32 Commission determines that the plan meets certain requirements. Section 12 also
33 authorizes an alternative rate-making plan to include certain provisions, including,
34 without limitation, a mechanism for earnings-sharing with the customers of the
35 utility. Additionally, section 12 authorizes a natural gas utility to reject an
36 application for an alternative rate-making plan with modifications approved by the
37 Commission. Finally, section 12 authorizes the Commission to investigate and
38 change rates, tolls, charges, rules, regulations, practices and services relating to an
39 alternative rate-making plan under certain circumstances. Section 13 of this bill
40 provides that the provisions of this bill do not limit the existing rate-making
41 authority of the Commission.
42 Sections 3-10 of this bill define certain terms relating to alternative rate-making
43 plans.
44 Sections 14 and 15 of this bill create exceptions from the procedure set forth in
45 existing law to change a general rate schedule to authorize a natural gas utility
46 to file an application to establish an alternative rate-making plan pursuant to
47 section 12.
48 Existing law requires the Commission to adopt regulations to establish
49 procedures for an electric utility to apply to the Commission for the approval of an
50 alternative rate-making plan. (NRS 704.762) Section 16 of this bill requires that, if
51 an electric utility files an application for an alternative rate-making plan that
52 includes formula rates or a multi-year rate plan, the alternative rate-making plan
53 must include: (1) an earnings-sharing mechanism; and (2) certain information and
54 calculations relating to changes in risk to the electric utility.
55 Existing law authorizes an electric utility to apply to the Commission to
56 establish an alternative rate-making plan and sets forth certain requirements relating
57 to the approval of the plan by the Commission. (NRS 704.7621) Section 17 of this
58 bill requires that, if the Commission approves an application for an alternative rate-
59 making plan that authorizes the recovery of the costs of a capital expenditure: (1)
60 the electric utility must prove the capital expenditure was prudent; and (2) if the
61 Commission determines that the electric utility did not prove the capital
62 expenditure was prudent, the Commission shall require the electric utility to refund
63 the costs of the capital expenditure charged to the customers of the electric utility.

31 force.
32 (e) A public utility may not set forth as justification for a rate

2 application, the public utility shall submit with its application a
3 statement showing the recorded results of revenues, expenses,
4 investments and costs of capital for its most recent 12 months for

10 12 months, adjusted for increased revenues, any increased
11 investment in facilities, increased expenses for depreciation, certain
12 other operating expenses as approved by the Commission and
13 changes in the costs of securities which are known and are
14 measurable with reasonable accuracy at the time of filing and which
15 will become effective within 6 months after the last month of those
16 12 months, but the public utility shall not place into effect any
17 increased rates until the changes have been experienced and
18 certified by the public utility to the Commission and the

23 period or the period for certification as set forth in the application.
24 Adjustments to revenues, operating expenses and costs of securities
25 must be calculated on an annual basis. Within 90 days after the date
26 on which the certification required by this subsection is filed with
27 the Commission, or within the period set forth in subsection 2,
28 whichever time is longer, the Commission shall make such order in
29 reference to the increased rates as is required by this chapter. The
30 following public utilities shall each file a general rate application
31 pursuant to this subsection based on the following schedule:
32 (a) An electric utility that primarily serves less densely
33 populated counties shall file a general rate application:
34 (1) Not later than 5 p.m. on or before the first Monday in
35 June 2019; and
36 (2) At least once every 36 months thereafter or on a date
37 specified in an alternative rate-making plan approved by the
38 Commission pursuant to NRS 704.7621.
39 (b) An electric utility that primarily serves densely populated
40 counties shall file a general rate application:
41 (1) Not later than 5 p.m. on or before the first Monday in
42 June 2020; and

1 (c) A public utility that furnishes water for municipal, industrial
2 or domestic purposes or services for the disposal of sewage, or both,
3 which had an annual gross operating revenue of $2,000,000 or more
4 for at least 1 year during the immediately preceding 3 years and
5 which had not filed a general rate application with the Commission
6 on or after July 1, 2005, shall file a general rate application on or
7 before June 30, 2008, and at least once every 36 months thereafter
8 unless waived by the Commission pursuant to standards adopted by
9 regulation of the Commission. If a public utility furnishes both
10 water and services for the disposal of sewage, its annual gross
11 operating revenue for each service must be considered separately for
12 determining whether the public utility meets the requirements of this
13 paragraph for either service.
14 (d) A public utility that furnishes water for municipal, industrial
15 or domestic purposes or services for the disposal of sewage, or both,
16 which had an annual gross operating revenue of $2,000,000 or more
17 for at least 1 year during the immediately preceding 3 years and
18 which had filed a general rate application with the Commission on
19 or after July 1, 2005, shall file a general rate application on or before
20 June 30, 2009, and at least once every 36 months thereafter unless
21 waived by the Commission pursuant to standards adopted by
22 regulation of the Commission. If a public utility furnishes both
23 water and services for the disposal of sewage, its annual gross
24 operating revenue for each service must be considered separately for
25 determining whether the public utility meets the requirements of this
26 paragraph for either service.
27  The Commission shall adopt regulations setting forth standards
28 for waivers pursuant to paragraphs (c) and (d) and for including the
29 costs incurred by the public utility in preparing and presenting the
30 general rate application before the effective date of any change in
31 rates.
32 4. In addition to submitting the statement required pursuant to
33 subsection 3, a public utility may submit with its general rate
34 application a statement showing the effects, on an annualized basis,
35 of all expected changes in circumstances. If such a statement is
36 filed, it must include all increases and decreases in revenue and
37 expenses which may occur within 210 days after the date on which
38 its general rate application is filed with the Commission if such
39 expected changes in circumstances are reasonably known and are
40 measurable with reasonable accuracy. If a public utility submits
41 such a statement, the public utility has the burden of proving that the
42 expected changes in circumstances set forth in the statement are
43 reasonably known and are measurable with reasonable accuracy.
44 The Commission shall consider expected changes in circumstances
45 to be reasonably known and measurable with reasonable accuracy if
-
*SB417_R2*
– 13 –
1 the expected changes in circumstances consist of specific and
2 identifiable events or programs rather than general trends, patterns
3 or developments, have an objectively high probability of occurring
4 to the degree, in the amount and at the time expected, are primarily
5 measurable by recorded or verifiable revenues and expenses and are
6 easily and objectively calculated, with the calculation of the
7 expected changes relying only secondarily on estimates, forecasts,
8 projections or budgets. If the Commission determines that the public
9 utility has met its burden of proof:
10 (a) The Commission shall consider the statement submitted
11 pursuant to this subsection and evidence relevant to the statement,
12 including all reasonable projected or forecasted offsets in revenue
13 and expenses that are directly attributable to or associated with the
14 expected changes in circumstances under consideration, in addition
15 to the statement required pursuant to subsection 3 as evidence in
16 establishing just and reasonable rates for the public utility; and
17 (b) The public utility is not required to file with the Commission
18 the certification that would otherwise be required pursuant to
19 subsection 3.
20 5. If a public utility files with the Commission an application to
21 make changes in any schedule and the Commission does not issue a
22 final written order regarding the proposed changes within the time
23 required by this section, the proposed changes shall be deemed to be
24 approved by the Commission.
25 6. If a public utility files with the Commission a general rate
26 application, the public utility, or a public utility affiliated with the
27 public utility through common ownership, shall not file with the
28 Commission another general rate application until all pending
29 general rate applications filed by that public utility have been
30 decided by the Commission unless, after application and hearing,
31 the Commission determines that a substantial financial emergency
32 would exist if the public utility or its affiliate is not permitted to file
33 another general rate application sooner. The provisions of this
34 subsection do not prohibit a public utility from filing with the
35 Commission, while a general rate application is pending, an
36 application to recover the increased cost of purchased fuel,
37 purchased power, or natural gas purchased for resale pursuant to
38 subsection 7, a quarterly rate adjustment pursuant to subsection 8 or
39 10, any information relating to deferred accounting requirements
40 pursuant to NRS 704.185 or an annual deferred energy accounting
41 adjustment application pursuant to NRS 704.187, if the public utility
42 is otherwise authorized to so file by those provisions.
43 7. A public utility may file an application to recover the
44 increased cost of purchased fuel, purchased power, or natural gas
-
*SB417_R2*
– 14 –
1 purchased for resale once every 30 days. The provisions of this
2 subsection do not apply to:
3 (a) An electric utility which is required to adjust its rates on a
4 quarterly basis pursuant to subsection 10; or
5 (b) A public utility which purchases natural gas for resale and
6 which adjusts its rates on a quarterly basis pursuant to subsection 8.
7 8. A public utility which purchases natural gas for resale must
8 request approval from the Commission to adjust its rates on a
9 quarterly basis between annual rate adjustment applications based
10 on changes in the public utility’s recorded costs of natural gas
11 purchased for resale. A public utility which purchases natural gas
12 for resale and which adjusts its rates on a quarterly basis may
13 request approval from the Commission to make quarterly
14 adjustments to its deferred energy accounting adjustment. The
15 Commission shall approve or deny such a request not later than 120
16 days after the application is filed with the Commission. The
17 Commission may approve the request if the Commission finds that
18 approval of the request is in the public interest. If the Commission
19 approves a request to make quarterly adjustments to the deferred
20 energy accounting adjustment of a public utility pursuant to this
21 subsection, any quarterly adjustment to the deferred energy
22 accounting adjustment must not exceed 2.5 cents per therm of
23 natural gas. If the balance of the public utility’s deferred account
24 varies by less than 5 percent from the public utility’s annual
25 recorded costs of natural gas which are used to calculate quarterly
26 rate adjustments, the deferred energy accounting adjustment must be
27 set to zero cents per therm of natural gas.
28 9. If the Commission approves a request to make any rate
29 adjustments on a quarterly basis pursuant to subsection 8:
30 (a) The public utility shall file written notice with the
31 Commission before the public utility makes a quarterly rate
32 adjustment. A quarterly rate adjustment is not subject to the
33 requirements for notice and a hearing pursuant to NRS 703.320 or
34 the requirements for a consumer session pursuant to subsection 1 of
35 NRS 704.069.
36 (b) The public utility shall provide written notice of each
37 quarterly rate adjustment to its customers by including the written
38 notice with a customer’s regular monthly bill or by electronic
39 transmission pursuant to NRS 704.188. The public utility shall
40 begin providing such written notice to its customers not later than 30
41 days after the date on which the public utility files its written notice
42 with the Commission pursuant to paragraph (a). The written notice
43 required by this paragraph:
44 (1) Must be printed separately, if included with the
45 customer’s regular monthly bill, or the subject line of the electronic
-
*SB417_R2*
– 15 –
1 transmission must indicate that notice of a quarterly rate adjustment
2 is included, if provided by electronic transmission pursuant to NRS
3 704.188; and
4 (2) Must include the following in clear and bold text:
5 (I) The total amount of the increase or decrease in the
6 public utility’s revenues from the rate adjustment, stated in dollars
7 and as a percentage;
8 (II) The amount of the monthly increase or decrease in
9 charges for each class of customer or class of service, stated in
10 dollars and as a percentage;
11 (III) A statement that customers may send written
12 comments or protests regarding the rate adjustment to the
13 Commission;
14 (IV) A statement that the transactions and recorded costs
15 of natural gas which are the basis for any quarterly rate adjustment
16 will be reviewed for reasonableness and prudence in the next
17 proceeding held by the Commission to review the annual rate
18 adjustment application pursuant to paragraph (d); and
19 (V) Any other information required by the Commission.
20 (c) The public utility shall file an annual rate adjustment
21 application with the Commission. The annual rate adjustment
22 application is subject to the requirements for notice and a hearing
23 pursuant to NRS 703.320 and the requirements for a consumer
24 session pursuant to subsection 1 of NRS 704.069.
25 (d) The proceeding regarding the annual rate adjustment
26 application must include a review of each quarterly rate adjustment
27 and the transactions and recorded costs of natural gas included in
28 each quarterly filing and the annual rate adjustment application.
29 There is no presumption of reasonableness or prudence for any
30 quarterly rate adjustment or for any transactions or recorded costs of
31 natural gas included in any quarterly rate adjustment or the annual
32 rate adjustment application, and the public utility has the burden of
33 proving reasonableness and prudence in the proceeding.
34 (e) The Commission shall not allow the public utility to recover
35 any recorded costs of natural gas which were the result of any
36 practice or transaction that was unreasonable or was undertaken,
37 managed or performed imprudently by the public utility, and the
38 Commission shall order the public utility to adjust its rates if the
39 Commission determines that any recorded costs of natural gas
40 included in any quarterly rate adjustment or the annual rate
41 adjustment application were not reasonable or prudent.
42 10. An electric utility shall adjust its rates on a quarterly basis
43 based on changes in the electric utility’s recorded costs of purchased
44 fuel or purchased power. In addition to adjusting its rates on a
45 quarterly basis, an electric utility may request approval from the
-
*SB417_R2*
– 16 –
1 Commission to make quarterly adjustments to its deferred energy
2 accounting adjustment. The Commission shall approve or deny such
3 a request not later than 120 days after the application is filed with
4 the Commission. The Commission may approve the request if the
5 Commission finds that approval of the request is in the public
6 interest. If the Commission approves a request to make quarterly
7 adjustments to the deferred energy accounting adjustment of an
8 electric utility pursuant to this subsection, any quarterly adjustment
9 to the deferred energy accounting adjustment must not exceed 0.25
10 cents per kilowatt-hour of electricity. If the balance of the electric
11 utility’s deferred account varies by less than 5 percent from the
12 electric utility’s annual recorded costs for purchased fuel or
13 purchased power which are used to calculate quarterly rate
14 adjustments, the deferred energy accounting adjustment must be set
15 to zero cents per kilowatt-hour of electricity.
16 11. A quarterly rate adjustment filed pursuant to subsection 10
17 is subject to the following requirements:
18 (a) The electric utility shall file written notice with the
19 Commission on or before August 15, 2007, and every quarter
20 thereafter of the quarterly rate adjustment to be made by the electric
21 utility for the following quarter. The first quarterly rate adjustment
22 by the electric utility will take effect on October 1, 2007, and each
23 subsequent quarterly rate adjustment will take effect every quarter
24 thereafter. The first quarterly adjustment to a deferred energy
25 accounting adjustment must be made pursuant to an order issued by
26 the Commission approving the application of an electric utility to
27 make quarterly adjustments to its deferred energy accounting
28 adjustment. A quarterly rate adjustment is not subject to the
29 requirements for notice and a hearing pursuant to NRS 703.320 or
30 the requirements for a consumer session pursuant to subsection 1 of
31 NRS 704.069.
32 (b) The electric utility shall provide written notice of each
33 quarterly rate adjustment to its customers by including the written
34 notice with a customer’s regular monthly bill or by electronic
35 submission pursuant to NRS 704.188. The electric utility shall begin
36 providing such written notice to its customers not later than 30 days
37 after the date on which the electric utility files a written notice with
38 the Commission pursuant to paragraph (a). The written notice
39 required by this paragraph:
40 (1) Must be printed separately, if included with the
41 customer’s regular monthly bill, or the subject line of the electronic
42 transmission must indicate that notice of a quarterly rate adjustment
43 is included, if provided by electronic transmission pursuant to NRS
44 704.188; and
45 (2) Must include the following in clear and bold text:
-
*SB417_R2*
– 17 –
1 (I) The total amount of the increase or decrease in the
2 electric utility’s revenues from the rate adjustment, stated in dollars
3 and as a percentage;
4 (II) The amount of the monthly increase or decrease in
5 charges for each class of customer or class of service, stated in
6 dollars and as a percentage;
7 (III) A statement that customers may send written
8 comments or protests regarding the rate adjustment to the
9 Commission;
10 (IV) A statement that the transactions and recorded costs
11 of purchased fuel or purchased power which are the basis for any
12 quarterly rate adjustment will be reviewed for reasonableness and
13 prudence in the next proceeding held by the Commission to review
14 the annual deferred energy accounting adjustment application
15 pursuant to paragraph (d); and
16 (V) Any other information required by the Commission.
17 (c) The electric utility shall file an annual deferred energy
18 accounting adjustment application pursuant to NRS 704.187 with
19 the Commission. The annual deferred energy accounting adjustment
20 application is subject to the requirements for notice and a hearing
21 pursuant to NRS 703.320 and the requirements for a consumer
22 session pursuant to subsection 1 of NRS 704.069.
23 (d) The proceeding regarding the annual deferred energy
24 accounting adjustment application must include a review of each
25 quarterly rate adjustment and the transactions and recorded costs of
26 purchased fuel and purchased power included in each quarterly
27 filing and the annual deferred energy accounting adjustment
28 application. There is no presumption of reasonableness or prudence
29 for any quarterly rate adjustment or for any transactions or recorded
30 costs of purchased fuel and purchased power included in any
31 quarterly rate adjustment or the annual deferred energy accounting
32 adjustment application, and the electric utility has the burden of
33 proving reasonableness and prudence in the proceeding.
34 (e) The Commission shall not allow the electric utility to recover
35 any recorded costs of purchased fuel and purchased power which
36 were the result of any practice or transaction that was unreasonable
37 or was undertaken, managed or performed imprudently by the
38 electric utility, and the Commission shall order the electric utility to
39 adjust its rates if the Commission determines that any recorded costs
40 of purchased fuel and purchased power included in any quarterly
41 rate adjustment or the annual deferred energy accounting adjustment
42 application were not reasonable or prudent.
43 12. If an electric utility files an annual deferred energy
44 accounting adjustment application pursuant to subsection 11 and
-
*SB417_R2*
– 18 –
1 NRS 704.187 while a general rate application is pending, the
2 electric utility shall:
3 (a) Submit with its annual deferred energy accounting
4 adjustment application information relating to the cost of service
5 and rate design; and
6 (b) Supplement its general rate application with the same
7 information, if such information was not submitted with the general
8 rate application.
9 13. A utility facility identified in a 3-year plan submitted
10 pursuant to NRS 704.741 and accepted by the Commission for
11 acquisition or construction pursuant to NRS 704.751 and the
12 regulations adopted pursuant thereto, or the retirement or
13 elimination of a utility facility identified in an emissions reduction
14 and capacity replacement plan submitted pursuant to NRS 704.7316
15 and accepted by the Commission for retirement or elimination
16 pursuant to NRS 704.751 and the regulations adopted pursuant
17 thereto, shall be deemed to be a prudent investment. The utility may
18 recover all just and reasonable costs of planning and constructing, or
19 retiring or eliminating, as applicable, such a facility. For the
20 purposes of this subsection, a plan or an amendment to a plan shall
21 be deemed to be accepted by the Commission only as to that portion
22 of the plan or amendment accepted as filed or modified with the
23 consent of the utility pursuant to NRS 704.751.
24 14. In regard to any rate or schedule approved or disapproved
25 pursuant to this section, the Commission may, after a hearing:
26 (a) Upon the request of the utility, approve a new rate but delay
27 the implementation of that new rate:
28 (1) Until a date determined by the Commission; and
29 (2) Under conditions as determined by the Commission,
30 including, without limitation, a requirement that interest charges be
31 included in the collection of the new rate; and
32 (b) Authorize a utility to implement a reduced rate for low-
33 income residential customers.
34 15. The Commission may, upon request and for good cause
35 shown, permit a public utility which purchases natural gas for resale
36 or an electric utility to make a quarterly adjustment to its deferred
37 energy accounting adjustment in excess of the maximum allowable
38 adjustment pursuant to subsection 8 or 10.
39 16. A public utility which purchases natural gas for resale or an
40 electric utility that makes quarterly adjustments to its deferred
41 energy accounting adjustment pursuant to subsection 8 or 10 may
42 submit to the Commission for approval an application to discontinue
43 making quarterly adjustments to its deferred energy accounting
44 adjustment and to subsequently make annual adjustments to its
45 deferred energy accounting adjustment. The Commission may
-
*SB417_R2*
– 19 –
1 approve an application submitted pursuant to this subsection if the
2 Commission finds that approval of the application is in the public
3 interest.
4 17. As used in this section:
5 (a) “Deferred energy accounting adjustment” means the rate of a
6 public utility which purchases natural gas for resale or an electric
7 utility that is calculated by dividing the balance of a deferred
8 account during a specified period by the total therms or kilowatt-
9 hours which have been sold in the geographical area to which the
10 rate applies during the specified period, not including kilowatt-hours
11 sold pursuant to an expanded solar access program established
12 pursuant to NRS 704.7865.
13 (b) “Electric utility” has the meaning ascribed to it in
14 NRS 704.187.
15 (c) “Electric utility that primarily serves densely populated
16 counties” means an electric utility that, with regard to the provision
17 of electric service, derives more of its annual gross operating
18 revenue in this State from customers located in counties whose
19 population is 700,000 or more than it does from customers located
20 in counties whose population is less than 700,000.
21 (d) “Electric utility that primarily serves less densely populated
22 counties” means an electric utility that, with regard to the provision
23 of electric service, derives more of its annual gross operating
24 revenue in this State from customers located in counties whose
25 population is less than 700,000 than it does from customers located
26 in counties whose population is 700,000 or more.
27 Sec. 16. NRS 704.762 is hereby amended to read as follows:
28 704.762 1. The Commission shall adopt regulations to
29 establish procedures for an electric utility to apply to the
30 Commission for the approval of an alternative rate-making plan.
31 The regulations must:
32 (a) Establish the alternative rate-making mechanisms that may
33 be included in such a plan and any limitations on such alternative
34 rate-making mechanisms as the Commission deems appropriate,
35 including, without limitation, any restrictions on the types of
36 alternative rate-making mechanisms that may be used in concert
37 within the same alternative rate-making plan.
38 (b) Provide the information that must be included in an
39 alternative rate-making plan and an application submitted pursuant
40 to the regulations adopted pursuant to this section.

9 formula rates or a multi-year rate plan, the alternative rate-
10 making plan must include, without limitation:
11 (a) An earnings-sharing mechanism; and
12 (b) A discussion identifying any changes in risk to the electric
13 utility and a calculation to adjust the rate of return of the electric
14 utility based on the changes in risk to the electric utility, which

38 modifications, or deny an application submitted pursuant to
39 subsection 1 not later than 210 days after the Commission receives a
40 copy of the application unless the Commission, upon good cause,
41 extends by not more than 90 days the time to act upon the
42 application. If the Commission fails to act upon an application
43 within the time provided by this subsection, the application shall be
44 deemed to be denied.

1 3. The Commission shall conduct at least one consumer session
2 pursuant to NRS 704.069 to solicit comments from the public before
3 taking action on an application submitted pursuant to subsection 1.
4 4. The Commission shall not approve an application submitted

22 (b) A term or condition waiving the requirement that the electric
23 utility file a general rate application every 36 months pursuant to
24 subsection 3 of NRS 704.110 or extending beyond 36 months the
25 time between required general rate application filings.
26 (c) Any other term or condition proposed by an electric utility or
27 any party participating in the proceeding or that the Commission
28 finds is reasonable and serves the public interest.
29 6. If the Commission approves an application for an
30 alternative rate-making plan that authorizes the recovery of the
31 costs of a capital expenditure:
32 (a) The electric utility must prove that the capital expenditure
33 was prudent at the time the electric utility files a general rate
34 application pursuant to NRS 704.110 or at any time established by
35 regulation of the Commission; and
36 (b) If the Commission determines during a general rate case
37 proceeding conducted pursuant to NRS 704.110 that the electric
38 utility did not prove that the capital expenditure was prudent, the
39 Commission shall require the electric utility to refund the
40 customers of the electric utility the amount previously recovered
41 through charges to customers of the electric utility for the costs of
42 the capital expenditure.
43 7. The Commission may at any time, upon its own motion or
44 after receiving a complaint from any customer, the Consumer’s
45 Advocate or the Regulatory Operations Staff of the Commission,
-

1 investigate any of the rates, tolls, charges, rules, regulations,
2 practices and service relating to an alternative rate-making plan,
3 and, after a full hearing as provided in NRS 704.120, by order, make
4 such changes as may be just and reasonable to the same extent as
5 authorized by NRS 704.120.
6 [7.] 8. As used in this section:
7 (a) “Electric utility that primarily serves densely populated
8 counties” has the meaning ascribed to it in NRS 704.110.

10 counties” has the meaning ascribed to it in NRS 704.110.

GROWTH AND INFRASTRUCTURE
MARCH 20, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Growth and Infrastructure
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to public utilities.
(BDR 58-1106)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public utilities; requiring the Public Utilities
Commission of Nevada to adopt regulations governing
the filing of an application for the establishment of an
alternative rate-making plan by a natural gas utility;
setting forth certain requirements for the submission and
approval of such an alternative rate-making plan; revising
certain provisions relating to the application and approval
for an alternative rate-making plan by an electric utility;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth certain procedures for a public utility to make changes to
2 a general rate schedule by applying to Public Utilities Commission of Nevada.
3 (NRS 704.100, 704.110) Section 11 of this bill requires the Commission to adopt
4 regulations establishing procedures for a natural gas utility to apply to the
5 Commission for the approval of an alternative rate-making plan, which establishes
6 the alternative rate-making mechanisms that the natural gas utility is authorized to
7 use to set rates during the time period of the plan. The regulations adopted by the
8 Commission must: (1) establish the alternative rate-making mechanisms that may
9 be included in a plan and any limitations on such alternative rate-making
10 mechanisms; (2) prescribe the information that must be included in an alternative
11 rate-making plan and an application for the approval of such a plan; (3) specify the
12 circumstances under which a natural gas utility for which an alternative rate-
13 making plan has been approved must file a general rate application; (4) provide a
14 process to educate customers of a natural gas utility regarding alternative rate-
15 making mechanisms; (5) require a natural gas utility for which an alternative rate-
16 making plan has been approved to keep certain records; and (6) establish criteria for
17 the evaluation of an alternative rate-making plan. Additionally, section 11 requires
18 that, if a natural gas utility files an application for an alternative rate-making plan
-
*SB417_R2*

– 2 –
19 that includes formula rates or a multi-year rate plan, the alternative rate-making
20 plan must include: (1) an earnings-sharing mechanism; and (2) certain information
21 and calculations relating to changes in risk to the natural gas utility.
22 Section 12 of this bill authorizes a natural gas utility to submit an application to
23 establish an alternative rate-making plan pursuant to the regulations adopted by the
24 Commission, establishes time limits for the Commission to approve or deny such
25 an application and requires the Commission to conduct a consumer session in each
26 major geographic area in which the natural gas utility provides services before
27 taking action on such an application. Section 12 requires an application for the
28 approval of an alternative rate-making plan to include a plan to educate the
29 customers of the natural gas utility regarding the alternative rate-making
30 mechanisms in the plan proposed by the utility. Section 12 prohibits the
31 Commission from approving an alternative rate-making plan unless the
32 Commission determines that the plan meets certain requirements. Section 12 also
33 authorizes an alternative rate-making plan to include certain provisions, including,
34 without limitation, a mechanism for earnings-sharing with the customers of the
35 utility. Additionally, section 12 authorizes a natural gas utility to reject an
36 application for an alternative rate-making plan with modifications approved by the
37 Commission. Finally, section 12 authorizes the Commission to investigate and
38 change rates, tolls, charges, rules, regulations, practices and services relating to an
39 alternative rate-making plan under certain circumstances. Section 13 of this bill
40 provides that the provisions of this bill do not limit the existing rate-making
41 authority of the Commission.
42 Sections 3-10 of this bill define certain terms relating to alternative rate-making
43 plans.
44 Sections 14 and 15 of this bill create exceptions from the procedure set forth in
45 existing law to change a general rate schedule to authorize a natural gas utility
46 to file an application to establish an alternative rate-making plan pursuant to
47 section 12.
48 Existing law requires the Commission to adopt regulations to establish
49 procedures for an electric utility to apply to the Commission for the approval of an
50 alternative rate-making plan. (NRS 704.762) Section 16 of this bill requires that, if
51 an electric utility files an application for an alternative rate-making plan that
52 includes formula rates or a multi-year rate plan, the alternative rate-making plan
53 must include: (1) an earnings-sharing mechanism; and (2) certain information and
54 calculations relating to changes in risk to the electric utility.
55 Existing law authorizes an electric utility to apply to the Commission to
56 establish an alternative rate-making plan and sets forth certain requirements relating
57 to the approval of the plan by the Commission. (NRS 704.7621) Section 17 of this
58 bill requires that, if the Commission approves an application for an alternative rate-
59 making plan that authorizes the recovery of the costs of a capital expenditure: (1)
60 the electric utility must prove the capital expenditure was prudent; and (2) if the
61 Commission determines that the electric utility did not prove the capital
62 expenditure was prudent, the Commission shall require the electric utility to refund
63 the costs of the capital expenditure charged to the customers of the electric utility.

33 rates charged to customers of the natural gas utility.
34 3. The Commission is not required to accept applications to
35 establish an alternative rate-making plan if the Commission

20 pursuant to NRS 704.069 in each major geographic area in which
21 the natural gas utility provides services to solicit comments from
22 the public before taking action on an application submitted
23 pursuant to subsection 1.
24 5. The Commission shall not approve an application
25 submitted pursuant to subsection 1 unless the Commission
26 determines that the plan:
27 (a) Is in the public interest;
28 (b) Results in just and reasonable rates, as determined by the
29 Commission;
30 (c) Protects the interests of the customers of the natural gas
31 utility;
32 (d) Satisfies the criteria established by the Commission
33 pursuant to paragraph (g) of subsection 1 of section 11 of this act;
34 (e) Specifies the time period to which the plan applies; and
35 (f) Includes a plan for educating the customers of the natural
36 gas utility regarding the alternative rate-making mechanisms
37 included in the plan.
38 6. An alternative rate-making plan may include, without
39 limitation:
40 (a) An earnings-sharing mechanism that balances the interests
41 of customers that purchase natural gas for consumption in this
42 State and the shareholders of the natural gas utility; and
43 (b) Any other term or condition proposed by a natural gas
44 utility or any party participating in the proceeding or that the
45 Commission finds is reasonable and serves the public interest.

1 7. If the Commission approves an application for an
2 alternative rate-making plan that authorizes the recovery of the
3 costs of a capital expenditure:
4 (a) The natural gas utility must prove that the capital
5 expenditure was prudent at the time the natural gas utility files a
6 general rate application pursuant to NRS 704.110 or at any time
7 established by regulation of the Commission; and
8 (b) If the Commission determines during a general rate case
9 proceeding conducted pursuant to NRS 704.110 that the natural
10 gas utility did not prove that the capital expenditure was prudent,
11 the Commission shall require the natural gas utility to refund the
12 customers of the natural gas utility the amount previously
13 recovered through charges to customers of the natural gas utility
14 for the costs of the capital expenditure.
15 8. If the Commission approves an application for an
16 alternative rate-making plan with modifications pursuant to
17 subsection 3, the natural gas utility may accept or reject the
18 modified alternative rate-making plan by filing a notice with
19 the Commission not later than 30 days after the date on which the
20 Commission issues an order approving the application. If a
21 natural gas utility files a notice to reject the modified alternative
22 rate-making plan, the alternative rate-making plan shall be
23 deemed withdrawn and:
24 (a) If a general rate application was filed at the same time as
25 the application for the alternative rate-making plan and the
26 general rate application or any portion thereof was approved, the
27 rates approved in the general rate application shall be deemed in
28 effect. To the extent that a portion of a general rate application is
29 approved, the rates that were in effect before the portion of the
30 general rate application was approved by the Commission remain
31 in effect for any portion of the general rate application not
32 approved by the Commission until changed or modified by the
33 Commission.
34 (b) If a general rate application was not filed at the same time
35 as the application for the alternative rate-making plan, the rates
36 that were in effect before the modified alternative rate-making
37 plan was approved remain in effect until changed or modified by
38 the Commission.
39 9. The Commission may at any time, upon its own motion or
40 after receiving a complaint from any customer, the Consumer’s
41 Advocate or the Regulatory Operations Staff of the Commission,
42 investigate any of the rates, tolls, charges, rules, regulations,
43 practices and services relating to the alternative rate-making plan,
44 and, after a full hearing as provided in NRS 704.120, by order,

1 make such changes as may be just and reasonable to the same
2 extent as authorized by NRS 704.120.
3 Sec. 13. The provisions of sections 2 to 12, inclusive, of this
4 act must not be construed to limit the existing rate-making
5 authority of the Commission.
6 Sec. 14. NRS 704.100 is hereby amended to read as follows:

22 costs of natural gas purchased for resale.
23 (c) An electric utility shall, between annual deferred energy
24 accounting adjustment applications filed pursuant to NRS 704.187,
25 adjust its rates on a quarterly basis pursuant to subsection 10 of

28 and all new or amended schedules in the same offices and in
29 substantially the same form, manner and places as required by NRS
30 704.070 for the posting of copies of schedules that are currently in
31 force.
32 (e) A public utility may not set forth as justification for a rate
33 increase any items of expense or rate base that previously have been

37 application to justify a reversal of the prior decision of the
38 Commission.
39 (f) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (g), if the
40 proposed change in any schedule does not change any rate or will
41 result in an increase in annual gross operating revenue in an amount
42 that does not exceed $15,000:

44 Commission using a letter of advice in lieu of filing an application;
45 and
-
*SB417_R2*

– 9 –
1 (2) The Commission shall determine whether it should
2 dispense with a hearing regarding the proposed change.
3  A letter of advice filed pursuant to this paragraph must include a
4 certification by the attorney for the public utility or an affidavit by
5 an authorized representative of the public utility that to the best of
6 the signatory’s knowledge, information and belief, formed after a

34 dispense with a hearing regarding the proposed change.
35  Not later than 10 business days after the filing of a letter of
36 advice pursuant to subparagraph (1), the Regulatory Operations
37 Staff of the Commission or any other interested party may file with
38 the Commission a request that the Commission order an applicant to
39 file a general rate application in accordance with subsection 3 of
40 NRS 704.110. The Commission may hold a hearing to consider such
41 a request.
42 (h) In making the determination pursuant to paragraph (f) or (g),
43 the Commission shall first consider all timely written protests, any
44 presentation that the Regulatory Operations Staff of the Commission

1 may desire to present, the application of the public utility and any
2 other matters deemed relevant by the Commission.
3 2. An applicant that is a small-scale provider of last resort may
4 submit to the Commission a written request for a waiver of the 5-
5 year period specified in sub-subparagraph (III) of subparagraph (1)
6 of paragraph (g) of subsection 1. The Commission shall, not later
7 than 90 days after receipt of such a request, issue an order approving
8 or denying the request. The Commission may approve the request if
9 the applicant provides proof satisfactory to the Commission that the
10 applicant is not earning more than the rate of return authorized by
11 the Commission and that it is in the public interest for the
12 Commission to grant the request for a waiver. The Commission
13 shall not approve a request for a waiver if the request is submitted
14 later than 7 years after the issuance by the Commission of a final
15 order on a general rate application filed by the applicant in
16 accordance with subsection 3 of NRS 704.110. If the Commission
17 approves a request for a waiver submitted pursuant to this
18 subsection, the applicant shall file the letter of advice pursuant to
19 subparagraph (1) of paragraph (g) of subsection 1 not earlier than
20 120 days after the date on which the applicant submitted the request
21 for a waiver pursuant to this subsection, unless the order issued by
22 the Commission approving the request for a waiver specifies a
23 different period for the filing of the letter of advice.
24 3. As used in this section, “electric utility” has the meaning
25 ascribed to it in NRS 704.187.
26 Sec. 15. NRS 704.110 is hereby amended to read as follows:
27 704.110 Except as otherwise provided in NRS 704.075,
28 704.68861 to 704.68887, inclusive, and 704.7865, or as may

33 changes that will result in a discontinuance, modification or
34 restriction of service, the Commission shall investigate the propriety
35 of the proposed changes to determine whether to approve or
36 disapprove the proposed changes. If an electric utility files such an
37 application and the application is a general rate application or an
38 annual deferred energy accounting adjustment application, the
39 Consumer’s Advocate shall be deemed a party of record.
40 2. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3, if a public
41 utility files with the Commission an application to make changes in
42 any schedule, the Commission shall, not later than 210 days after the
43 date on which the application is filed, issue a written order
44 approving or disapproving, in whole or in part, the proposed

1 3. If a public utility files with the Commission a general rate
2 application, the public utility shall submit with its application a
3 statement showing the recorded results of revenues, expenses,
4 investments and costs of capital for its most recent 12 months for
5 which data were available when the application was prepared.
6 Except as otherwise provided in subsection 4, in determining
7 whether to approve or disapprove any increased rates, the
8 Commission shall consider evidence in support of the increased
9 rates based upon actual recorded results of operations for the same
10 12 months, adjusted for increased revenues, any increased
11 investment in facilities, increased expenses for depreciation, certain
12 other operating expenses as approved by the Commission and
13 changes in the costs of securities which are known and are
14 measurable with reasonable accuracy at the time of filing and which
15 will become effective within 6 months after the last month of those
16 12 months, but the public utility shall not place into effect any
17 increased rates until the changes have been experienced and
18 certified by the public utility to the Commission and the
19 Commission has approved the increased rates. The Commission
20 shall also consider evidence supporting expenses for depreciation,
21 calculated on an annual basis, applicable to major components of the
22 public utility’s plant placed into service during the recorded test
23 period or the period for certification as set forth in the application.
24 Adjustments to revenues, operating expenses and costs of securities
25 must be calculated on an annual basis. Within 90 days after the date
26 on which the certification required by this subsection is filed with
27 the Commission, or within the period set forth in subsection 2,
28 whichever time is longer, the Commission shall make such order in
29 reference to the increased rates as is required by this chapter. The
30 following public utilities shall each file a general rate application
31 pursuant to this subsection based on the following schedule:
32 (a) An electric utility that primarily serves less densely
33 populated counties shall file a general rate application:
34 (1) Not later than 5 p.m. on or before the first Monday in
35 June 2019; and
36 (2) At least once every 36 months thereafter or on a date
37 specified in an alternative rate-making plan approved by the
38 Commission pursuant to NRS 704.7621.
39 (b) An electric utility that primarily serves densely populated
40 counties shall file a general rate application:
41 (1) Not later than 5 p.m. on or before the first Monday in
42 June 2020; and
43 (2) At least once every 36 months thereafter or on a date
44 specified in an alternative rate-making plan approved by the
45 Commission pursuant to NRS 704.7621.

1 (c) A public utility that furnishes water for municipal, industrial
2 or domestic purposes or services for the disposal of sewage, or both,
3 which had an annual gross operating revenue of $2,000,000 or more
4 for at least 1 year during the immediately preceding 3 years and
5 which had not filed a general rate application with the Commission
6 on or after July 1, 2005, shall file a general rate application on or
7 before June 30, 2008, and at least once every 36 months thereafter
8 unless waived by the Commission pursuant to standards adopted by
9 regulation of the Commission. If a public utility furnishes both
10 water and services for the disposal of sewage, its annual gross
11 operating revenue for each service must be considered separately for
12 determining whether the public utility meets the requirements of this
13 paragraph for either service.
14 (d) A public utility that furnishes water for municipal, industrial
15 or domestic purposes or services for the disposal of sewage, or both,
16 which had an annual gross operating revenue of $2,000,000 or more
17 for at least 1 year during the immediately preceding 3 years and
18 which had filed a general rate application with the Commission on
19 or after July 1, 2005, shall file a general rate application on or before
20 June 30, 2009, and at least once every 36 months thereafter unless
21 waived by the Commission pursuant to standards adopted by
22 regulation of the Commission. If a public utility furnishes both
23 water and services for the disposal of sewage, its annual gross
24 operating revenue for each service must be considered separately for
25 determining whether the public utility meets the requirements of this
26 paragraph for either service.
27  The Commission shall adopt regulations setting forth standards
28 for waivers pursuant to paragraphs (c) and (d) and for including the
29 costs incurred by the public utility in preparing and presenting the
30 general rate application before the effective date of any change in
31 rates.
32 4. In addition to submitting the statement required pursuant to
33 subsection 3, a public utility may submit with its general rate
34 application a statement showing the effects, on an annualized basis,
35 of all expected changes in circumstances. If such a statement is
36 filed, it must include all increases and decreases in revenue and
37 expenses which may occur within 210 days after the date on which
38 its general rate application is filed with the Commission if such
39 expected changes in circumstances are reasonably known and are
40 measurable with reasonable accuracy. If a public utility submits
41 such a statement, the public utility has the burden of proving that the
42 expected changes in circumstances set forth in the statement are
43 reasonably known and are measurable with reasonable accuracy.
44 The Commission shall consider expected changes in circumstances
45 to be reasonably known and measurable with reasonable accuracy if
-
*SB417_R2*

– 13 –
1 the expected changes in circumstances consist of specific and
2 identifiable events or programs rather than general trends, patterns
3 or developments, have an objectively high probability of occurring
4 to the degree, in the amount and at the time expected, are primarily
5 measurable by recorded or verifiable revenues and expenses and are
6 easily and objectively calculated, with the calculation of the
7 expected changes relying only secondarily on estimates, forecasts,
8 projections or budgets. If the Commission determines that the public
9 utility has met its burden of proof:
10 (a) The Commission shall consider the statement submitted
11 pursuant to this subsection and evidence relevant to the statement,
12 including all reasonable projected or forecasted offsets in revenue
13 and expenses that are directly attributable to or associated with the
14 expected changes in circumstances under consideration, in addition
15 to the statement required pursuant to subsection 3 as evidence in
16 establishing just and reasonable rates for the public utility; and
17 (b) The public utility is not required to file with the Commission
18 the certification that would otherwise be required pursuant to
19 subsection 3.
20 5. If a public utility files with the Commission an application to
21 make changes in any schedule and the Commission does not issue a
22 final written order regarding the proposed changes within the time
23 required by this section, the proposed changes shall be deemed to be
24 approved by the Commission.
25 6. If a public utility files with the Commission a general rate
26 application, the public utility, or a public utility affiliated with the
27 public utility through common ownership, shall not file with the
28 Commission another general rate application until all pending
29 general rate applications filed by that public utility have been
30 decided by the Commission unless, after application and hearing,
31 the Commission determines that a substantial financial emergency
32 would exist if the public utility or its affiliate is not permitted to file
33 another general rate application sooner. The provisions of this
34 subsection do not prohibit a public utility from filing with the
35 Commission, while a general rate application is pending, an
36 application to recover the increased cost of purchased fuel,
37 purchased power, or natural gas purchased for resale pursuant to
38 subsection 7, a quarterly rate adjustment pursuant to subsection 8 or
39 10, any information relating to deferred accounting requirements
40 pursuant to NRS 704.185 or an annual deferred energy accounting
41 adjustment application pursuant to NRS 704.187, if the public utility
42 is otherwise authorized to so file by those provisions.
43 7. A public utility may file an application to recover the
44 increased cost of purchased fuel, purchased power, or natural gas
-
*SB417_R2*

– 14 –
1 purchased for resale once every 30 days. The provisions of this
2 subsection do not apply to:
3 (a) An electric utility which is required to adjust its rates on a
4 quarterly basis pursuant to subsection 10; or
5 (b) A public utility which purchases natural gas for resale and
6 which adjusts its rates on a quarterly basis pursuant to subsection 8.
7 8. A public utility which purchases natural gas for resale must
8 request approval from the Commission to adjust its rates on a
9 quarterly basis between annual rate adjustment applications based
10 on changes in the public utility’s recorded costs of natural gas
11 purchased for resale. A public utility which purchases natural gas
12 for resale and which adjusts its rates on a quarterly basis may
13 request approval from the Commission to make quarterly
14 adjustments to its deferred energy accounting adjustment. The
15 Commission shall approve or deny such a request not later than 120
16 days after the application is filed with the Commission. The
17 Commission may approve the request if the Commission finds that
18 approval of the request is in the public interest. If the Commission
19 approves a request to make quarterly adjustments to the deferred
20 energy accounting adjustment of a public utility pursuant to this
21 subsection, any quarterly adjustment to the deferred energy
22 accounting adjustment must not exceed 2.5 cents per therm of
23 natural gas. If the balance of the public utility’s deferred account
24 varies by less than 5 percent from the public utility’s annual
25 recorded costs of natural gas which are used to calculate quarterly
26 rate adjustments, the deferred energy accounting adjustment must be
27 set to zero cents per therm of natural gas.
28 9. If the Commission approves a request to make any rate
29 adjustments on a quarterly basis pursuant to subsection 8:
30 (a) The public utility shall file written notice with the
31 Commission before the public utility makes a quarterly rate
32 adjustment. A quarterly rate adjustment is not subject to the
33 requirements for notice and a hearing pursuant to NRS 703.320 or
34 the requirements for a consumer session pursuant to subsection 1 of
35 NRS 704.069.
36 (b) The public utility shall provide written notice of each
37 quarterly rate adjustment to its customers by including the written
38 notice with a customer’s regular monthly bill or by electronic
39 transmission pursuant to NRS 704.188. The public utility shall
40 begin providing such written notice to its customers not later than 30
41 days after the date on which the public utility files its written notice
42 with the Commission pursuant to paragraph (a). The written notice
43 required by this paragraph:
44 (1) Must be printed separately, if included with the
45 customer’s regular monthly bill, or the subject line of the electronic
-
*SB417_R2*

– 15 –
1 transmission must indicate that notice of a quarterly rate adjustment
2 is included, if provided by electronic transmission pursuant to NRS
3 704.188; and
4 (2) Must include the following in clear and bold text:
5 (I) The total amount of the increase or decrease in the
6 public utility’s revenues from the rate adjustment, stated in dollars
7 and as a percentage;
8 (II) The amount of the monthly increase or decrease in
9 charges for each class of customer or class of service, stated in
10 dollars and as a percentage;
11 (III) A statement that customers may send written
12 comments or protests regarding the rate adjustment to the
13 Commission;
14 (IV) A statement that the transactions and recorded costs
15 of natural gas which are the basis for any quarterly rate adjustment
16 will be reviewed for reasonableness and prudence in the next
17 proceeding held by the Commission to review the annual rate
18 adjustment application pursuant to paragraph (d); and
19 (V) Any other information required by the Commission.
20 (c) The public utility shall file an annual rate adjustment
21 application with the Commission. The annual rate adjustment
22 application is subject to the requirements for notice and a hearing
23 pursuant to NRS 703.320 and the requirements for a consumer
24 session pursuant to subsection 1 of NRS 704.069.
25 (d) The proceeding regarding the annual rate adjustment
26 application must include a review of each quarterly rate adjustment
27 and the transactions and recorded costs of natural gas included in
28 each quarterly filing and the annual rate adjustment application.
29 There is no presumption of reasonableness or prudence for any
30 quarterly rate adjustment or for any transactions or recorded costs of
31 natural gas included in any quarterly rate adjustment or the annual
32 rate adjustment application, and the public utility has the burden of
33 proving reasonableness and prudence in the proceeding.
34 (e) The Commission shall not allow the public utility to recover
35 any recorded costs of natural gas which were the result of any
36 practice or transaction that was unreasonable or was undertaken,
37 managed or performed imprudently by the public utility, and the
38 Commission shall order the public utility to adjust its rates if the
39 Commission determines that any recorded costs of natural gas
40 included in any quarterly rate adjustment or the annual rate
41 adjustment application were not reasonable or prudent.
42 10. An electric utility shall adjust its rates on a quarterly basis
43 based on changes in the electric utility’s recorded costs of purchased
44 fuel or purchased power. In addition to adjusting its rates on a
45 quarterly basis, an electric utility may request approval from the
-
*SB417_R2*

– 16 –
1 Commission to make quarterly adjustments to its deferred energy
2 accounting adjustment. The Commission shall approve or deny such
3 a request not later than 120 days after the application is filed with
4 the Commission. The Commission may approve the request if the
5 Commission finds that approval of the request is in the public
6 interest. If the Commission approves a request to make quarterly
7 adjustments to the deferred energy accounting adjustment of an
8 electric utility pursuant to this subsection, any quarterly adjustment
9 to the deferred energy accounting adjustment must not exceed 0.25
10 cents per kilowatt-hour of electricity. If the balance of the electric
11 utility’s deferred account varies by less than 5 percent from the
12 electric utility’s annual recorded costs for purchased fuel or
13 purchased power which are used to calculate quarterly rate
14 adjustments, the deferred energy accounting adjustment must be set
15 to zero cents per kilowatt-hour of electricity.
16 11. A quarterly rate adjustment filed pursuant to subsection 10
17 is subject to the following requirements:
18 (a) The electric utility shall file written notice with the
19 Commission on or before August 15, 2007, and every quarter
20 thereafter of the quarterly rate adjustment to be made by the electric
21 utility for the following quarter. The first quarterly rate adjustment
22 by the electric utility will take effect on October 1, 2007, and each
23 subsequent quarterly rate adjustment will take effect every quarter
24 thereafter. The first quarterly adjustment to a deferred energy
25 accounting adjustment must be made pursuant to an order issued by
26 the Commission approving the application of an electric utility to
27 make quarterly adjustments to its deferred energy accounting
28 adjustment. A quarterly rate adjustment is not subject to the
29 requirements for notice and a hearing pursuant to NRS 703.320 or
30 the requirements for a consumer session pursuant to subsection 1 of
31 NRS 704.069.
32 (b) The electric utility shall provide written notice of each
33 quarterly rate adjustment to its customers by including the written
34 notice with a customer’s regular monthly bill or by electronic
35 submission pursuant to NRS 704.188. The electric utility shall begin
36 providing such written notice to its customers not later than 30 days
37 after the date on which the electric utility files a written notice with
38 the Commission pursuant to paragraph (a). The written notice
39 required by this paragraph:
40 (1) Must be printed separately, if included with the
41 customer’s regular monthly bill, or the subject line of the electronic
42 transmission must indicate that notice of a quarterly rate adjustment
43 is included, if provided by electronic transmission pursuant to NRS
44 704.188; and
45 (2) Must include the following in clear and bold text:
-
*SB417_R2*

– 17 –
1 (I) The total amount of the increase or decrease in the
2 electric utility’s revenues from the rate adjustment, stated in dollars
3 and as a percentage;
4 (II) The amount of the monthly increase or decrease in
5 charges for each class of customer or class of service, stated in
6 dollars and as a percentage;
7 (III) A statement that customers may send written
8 comments or protests regarding the rate adjustment to the
9 Commission;
10 (IV) A statement that the transactions and recorded costs
11 of purchased fuel or purchased power which are the basis for any
12 quarterly rate adjustment will be reviewed for reasonableness and
13 prudence in the next proceeding held by the Commission to review
14 the annual deferred energy accounting adjustment application
15 pursuant to paragraph (d); and
16 (V) Any other information required by the Commission.
17 (c) The electric utility shall file an annual deferred energy
18 accounting adjustment application pursuant to NRS 704.187 with
19 the Commission. The annual deferred energy accounting adjustment
20 application is subject to the requirements for notice and a hearing
21 pursuant to NRS 703.320 and the requirements for a consumer
22 session pursuant to subsection 1 of NRS 704.069.
23 (d) The proceeding regarding the annual deferred energy
24 accounting adjustment application must include a review of each
25 quarterly rate adjustment and the transactions and recorded costs of
26 purchased fuel and purchased power included in each quarterly
27 filing and the annual deferred energy accounting adjustment
28 application. There is no presumption of reasonableness or prudence
29 for any quarterly rate adjustment or for any transactions or recorded
30 costs of purchased fuel and purchased power included in any
31 quarterly rate adjustment or the annual deferred energy accounting
32 adjustment application, and the electric utility has the burden of
33 proving reasonableness and prudence in the proceeding.
34 (e) The Commission shall not allow the electric utility to recover
35 any recorded costs of purchased fuel and purchased power which
36 were the result of any practice or transaction that was unreasonable
37 or was undertaken, managed or performed imprudently by the
38 electric utility, and the Commission shall order the electric utility to
39 adjust its rates if the Commission determines that any recorded costs
40 of purchased fuel and purchased power included in any quarterly
41 rate adjustment or the annual deferred energy accounting adjustment
42 application were not reasonable or prudent.
43 12. If an electric utility files an annual deferred energy
44 accounting adjustment application pursuant to subsection 11 and
-
*SB417_R2*

– 18 –
1 NRS 704.187 while a general rate application is pending, the
2 electric utility shall:
3 (a) Submit with its annual deferred energy accounting
4 adjustment application information relating to the cost of service
5 and rate design; and
6 (b) Supplement its general rate application with the same
7 information, if such information was not submitted with the general
8 rate application.
9 13. A utility facility identified in a 3-year plan submitted
10 pursuant to NRS 704.741 and accepted by the Commission for
11 acquisition or construction pursuant to NRS 704.751 and the
12 regulations adopted pursuant thereto, or the retirement or
13 elimination of a utility facility identified in an emissions reduction
14 and capacity replacement plan submitted pursuant to NRS 704.7316
15 and accepted by the Commission for retirement or elimination
16 pursuant to NRS 704.751 and the regulations adopted pursuant
17 thereto, shall be deemed to be a prudent investment. The utility may
18 recover all just and reasonable costs of planning and constructing, or
19 retiring or eliminating, as applicable, such a facility. For the
20 purposes of this subsection, a plan or an amendment to a plan shall
21 be deemed to be accepted by the Commission only as to that portion
22 of the plan or amendment accepted as filed or modified with the
23 consent of the utility pursuant to NRS 704.751.
24 14. In regard to any rate or schedule approved or disapproved
25 pursuant to this section, the Commission may, after a hearing:
26 (a) Upon the request of the utility, approve a new rate but delay
27 the implementation of that new rate:
28 (1) Until a date determined by the Commission; and
29 (2) Under conditions as determined by the Commission,
30 including, without limitation, a requirement that interest charges be
31 included in the collection of the new rate; and
32 (b) Authorize a utility to implement a reduced rate for low-
33 income residential customers.
34 15. The Commission may, upon request and for good cause
35 shown, permit a public utility which purchases natural gas for resale
36 or an electric utility to make a quarterly adjustment to its deferred
37 energy accounting adjustment in excess of the maximum allowable
38 adjustment pursuant to subsection 8 or 10.
39 16. A public utility which purchases natural gas for resale or an
40 electric utility that makes quarterly adjustments to its deferred
41 energy accounting adjustment pursuant to subsection 8 or 10 may
42 submit to the Commission for approval an application to discontinue
43 making quarterly adjustments to its deferred energy accounting
44 adjustment and to subsequently make annual adjustments to its
45 deferred energy accounting adjustment. The Commission may
-

– 19 –
1 approve an application submitted pursuant to this subsection if the
2 Commission finds that approval of the application is in the public
3 interest.
4 17. As used in this section:
5 (a) “Deferred energy accounting adjustment” means the rate of a
6 public utility which purchases natural gas for resale or an electric
7 utility that is calculated by dividing the balance of a deferred
8 account during a specified period by the total therms or kilowatt-
9 hours which have been sold in the geographical area to which the
10 rate applies during the specified period, not including kilowatt-hours
11 sold pursuant to an expanded solar access program established
12 pursuant to NRS 704.7865.
13 (b) “Electric utility” has the meaning ascribed to it in
14 NRS 704.187.
15 (c) “Electric utility that primarily serves densely populated
16 counties” means an electric utility that, with regard to the provision
17 of electric service, derives more of its annual gross operating
18 revenue in this State from customers located in counties whose
19 population is 700,000 or more than it does from customers located
20 in counties whose population is less than 700,000.
21 (d) “Electric utility that primarily serves less densely populated
22 counties” means an electric utility that, with regard to the provision
23 of electric service, derives more of its annual gross operating
24 revenue in this State from customers located in counties whose
25 population is less than 700,000 than it does from customers located
26 in counties whose population is 700,000 or more.
27 Sec. 16. NRS 704.762 is hereby amended to read as follows:
28 704.762 1. The Commission shall adopt regulations to

33 be included in such a plan and any limitations on such alternative
34 rate-making mechanisms as the Commission deems appropriate,
35 including, without limitation, any restrictions on the types of
36 alternative rate-making mechanisms that may be used in concert
37 within the same alternative rate-making plan.

1 plan ceases to meet the criteria established by the Commission
2 pursuant to paragraph (g).
3 (d) Provide a process to educate customers of an electric utility
4 regarding the available alternative rate-making mechanisms that
5 may be included in an alternative rate-making plan.
6 (e) Establish requirements for an electric utility for which the
7 Commission has approved an alternative rate-making plan to keep
8 or cause to be kept any information and records which the utility
9 would have been required to submit to the Commission as part of an
10 application pursuant to NRS 704.110 or 704.187, if the filing of any
11 such application is delayed or excused pursuant to the alternative
12 rate-making plan.
13 (f) If the Commission determines that it is practicable, require
14 an electric utility to include in its application for the approval of an
15 alternative rate-making plan:
16 (1) One or more cost of service studies.
17 (2) An analysis estimating and comparing:
18 (I) The rates that would be charged and the revenue that

22 would be collected pursuant to the rate-making process established
23 by NRS 704.110.
24 (g) Establish criteria for the evaluation of an alternative rate-

1 (8) Facilitates the research and development of innovative
2 electric utility services and options to benefit customers.
3 (9) Balances the interests of customers and shareholders by
4 providing for services that customers want while preserving

6 2. In addition to any requirement adopted by regulation of
7 the Commission pursuant to subsection 1, if an electric utility files
8 an application for an alternative rate-making plan that includes
9 formula rates or a multi-year rate plan, the alternative rate-
10 making plan must include, without limitation:
11 (a) An earnings-sharing mechanism; and
12 (b) A discussion identifying any changes in risk to the electric
13 utility and a calculation to adjust the rate of return of the electric
14 utility based on the changes in risk to the electric utility, which
