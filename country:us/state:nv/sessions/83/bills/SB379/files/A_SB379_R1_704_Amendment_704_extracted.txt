Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of installment lenders by the
2 Commissioner of Financial Institutions. (Chapter 675 of NRS) [With certain exceptions,
3 existing law prohibits a person from engaging in the business of lending without being
4 licensed by the Commissioner as an installment lender. (NRS 675.060) Section 20 of this bill
5 additionally prohibits a person from engaging in the business of a distributed generation
6 system financier or a manufactured home financier without being licensed by the
7 Commissioner as an installment lender. Section 18 of this bill defines: (1) “distributed
8 generation system financier,” in general, to mean a person who provides a loan to finance the
9 purchase of a distributed generation system, which section 18 designates as a “distributed
10 generation system loan,” leases a distributed generation system or contracts for a power
11 purchase agreement; and (2) “manufactured home financier” to mean, in general, a person
12 who provides a loan to finance the purchase of or leases a manufactured home that is not

13 permanently attached to land.] Section 1 of this bill prohibits an installment lender from
14 engaging in any deceptive trade practice.
15 Existing law imposes certain requirements on solar installation companies that sell and
16 install distributed generation systems in this State. Existing law prescribes certain contractual
17 requirements for an agreement for the purchase or lease of a distributed generation system and
18 a power purchase agreement. (NRS 598.9801-598.9822) Sections [2-17] 23.1-23.3 of this bill
19 impose various requirements on distributed generation system financiers and contractual
20 requirements for an agreement for the provision of a distributed generation system loan [or] ,
21 an agreement for the lease [for] of a distributed generation system [.] and a power purchase
22 agreement. Section 23.11 defines “distributed generation system financier” to mean, in
23 general, a person who provides a distributed generation system loan, leases a distributed
24 generation system or enters into a contract for a power purchase agreement. Section
25 23.12 defines “distributed generation system loan” to mean a loan made for the express
26 purpose of financing the purchase of a distributed generation system or any part thereof.
27 Section [6] 23.13 prohibits a distributed generation system financier from charging a
28 borrower, lessee, host customer or prospective borrower, lessee or host customer certain fees
29 that are attributable to a fee imposed on the financier by a third party in an amount that
30 exceeds the actual amount of the fee charged to the financier by the third party. Section [7]
31 23.14 sets forth certain requirements for the contents of an agreement for the provision of a
32 distributed generation system loan. Section [10] 23.16 requires a distributed generation
33 system financier to provide to a borrower , [or] lessee or host customer a copy of an
34 agreement for the provision of the distributed generation system loan [or] , an agreement for
35 the lease of a distributed generation system or a power purchase agreement immediately
36 after it is signed by the borrower , [or] lessee [.] or host customer.
37 Section [11] 23.17 sets forth certain requirements for a distributed generation system
38 financier with respect to a distributed generation system that will be installed on the roof of a
39 manufactured home.
40 Section [12] 23.18 requires a distributed generation system financier to ensure that any
41 solar installation company that will install a distributed generation system that is leased by
42 [or] the financier or for which a power purchase agreement or agreement for the
43 provision of a distributed generation system loan has been [issued] executed by the financier
44 holds the proper contractor’s license and is acting within the monetary limit of that license. If
45 a distributed generation system financier fails to do so, the loan [or] agreement, lease
46 agreement or power purchase agreement is voidable by the borrower , [or] lessee or host
47 customer for a certain period. Additionally, section [12 provides that] 23.18 prohibits a
48 distributed generation system financier [commits a deceptive trade practice if the financier
49 pays] from providing any money pursuant to a loan [or] agreement, lease agreement or
50 power purchase agreement to a solar installation company that does not have the proper
51 contractor’s license or who is acting outside the monetary limit of such a license. Section [14]
52 23.21 additionally prohibits such a financier from making certain payments to a solar
53 installation company before the distributed generation system has received permission from
54 the appropriate public utility to connect to the power grid or, if the system will not be
55 connected to the power grid, has passed a final inspection and become operational.
56 Section [13] 23.19 requires a distributed generation system financier to make and retain
57 certain recordings with a borrower or lessee. Section 31 of this bill : (1) removes the duty of
58 a solar installation company to make certain recordings concerning a lessee which is
59 imposed in section 23.19 on a distributed generation system financier; and (2) increases,
60 from 4 years to 5 years, the amount of time a solar installation company is required to
61 maintain certain recordings.
62 Section [15] 23.22 prohibits a distributed generation system financier from causing a
63 distributed generation system to be disconnected or otherwise unusable for the failure of a
64 borrower, lessee or host customer to make any payment required under an agreement for the
65 provision of a distributed generation system loan, an agreement for the lease of a distributed

67 customer, as applicable, has failed to make three consecutive monthly payments required
68 under the agreement.
69 Section [17] 23.3 requires a distributed generation system financier to comply with all
70 applicable federal laws and regulations.

72 distributed generation system loan , [or] an agreement for the lease of a distributed generation
73 system or a power purchase agreement is subject to all claims and defenses of the borrower
74 , [or] lessee or host customer against the distributed generation system financier who
75 provided the loan or entered into the lease [.] or power purchase agreement. Under section
76 [16,] 23.23, the liability of the assignee is limited to the amount owed to the assignee at the
77 time the claim or defense is asserted against assignee.
78 Section [21 of this bill revises provisions of existing law prohibiting a licensed
79 installment lender from advertising certain false, misleading or deceptive statements or
80 representations to specify that the prohibition also applies to applicable leases and specifically
81 includes such statements made by] 23.24 prohibits a distributed generation system financier
82 [with] from advertising any false, misleading or deceptive statement with regard to any
83 rate that may be charged by a public utility for electricity. [(NRS 675.280)
84 Section 22 of this bill revises provisions of existing law relating to retail installment sales
85 so that such provisions continue to apply to distributed generation system financiers and
86 manufactured home financiers who engage in certain activities. (NRS 97.125)]
87 Under existing law, a lessee or purchaser of a distributed generation system or a host
88 customer has the right to rescind the lease or purchase agreement 3 business days after the
89 agreement is signed. (NRS 598.98216) Sections [7, 9,] 23.14, 23.15, [26-29] 26-30 and 32 of
90 this bill provide a borrower, lessee , [or] purchaser or host customer the right to rescind an
91 agreement for the provision of a distributed generation system loan , [or] a lease or purchase
92 agreement [:] or a power purchase agreement: (1) 3 business days after signing, if the
93 person is [under] less than 60 years of age; and (2) 10 business days after signing, if the
94 person is 60 years of age or older. Sections [8, 9,] 23.15, 23.2 , 26-30 and 32 of this bill also
95 provide a borrower, lessee , [or] purchaser or host customer the right to rescind such an
96 agreement if the results of a required on-site physical survey of the premises conducted after
97 the execution of the agreement would require the alteration of the terms of the agreement to
98 increase the price of the distributed generation system or , with certain exceptions, change
99 the type of equipment used for the distributed generation system.
100 Section 23.4 of this bill imposes certain requirements and restrictions upon a person who
101 generates leads or referrals to perform work concerning a distributed generation system.
102 Section 23.6 of this bill prohibits a solar installation company from accepting any payment as

108 connection with the lease or purchase of a distributed generation system or the contracting for
109 a power purchase agreement.
110 Section 24 of this bill makes a conforming change so that the definitions applicable to the
111 provisions of existing law governing distributed generation systems apply to sections [23.2-
112 23.8.] 23.1-23.8. Section 33 of this bill provides that a violation of sections [23.2-23.8] 23.1-
113 23.8 constitutes a deceptive trade practice and consumer fraud.
114 Sections [7,] 23.6, 27 , [and] 29 and 30 also provide that a borrower, lessee , [or]
115 purchaser or host customer is not required to pay any money to a distributed generation
116 system financier or solar installation company , except for an initial deposit or down
117 payment that does not exceed a certain amount, before the distributed generation system
118 has received permission from the appropriate public utility to connect to the power grid or, if
119 the system will not be connected to the power grid, has passed a final inspection and become
120 operational.
121 Sections 27 and 29 additionally impose certain duties on a solar installation company if a
122 distributed generation system fails to meet the estimated amount of production in the first year
123 of operation of the system. Sections [7,] 23.14, 29 and 30 of this bill require an agreement for
124 the provision of a distributed generation system loan, an agreement for the lease of a
125 distributed generation system or a power purchase agreement to contain information
126 concerning whether a borrower, lessee or host customer may transfer the agreement in the
127 event of a sale of the property to which the distributed generation system is affixed and the
128 process to complete a payoff of any amount owed under the agreement. Sections 27, 29 and
Assembly Amendment No. 704 to Senate Bill No. 379 First Reprint Page 6
129 30 additionally require certain other provisions and disclosures to be included in an agreement
130 for the purchase or lease of a distributed generation system and a power purchase agreement.
131 Existing law excludes from the definition of “solar installation company” a person who
132 generates leads or referrals to perform work concerning a distributed generation system, if the
133 person’s activities are limited to certain specified activities. (NRS 598.9808) Section 25 of
134 this bill requires such a person to collect only the name, contact information and information
135 concerning the power bill of a prospective purchaser or lessee. Section 25 additionally
136 prohibits such a person from engaging in advertising through any media other than print
137 media.
138 Section 23.7 of this bill authorizes the State Contractors’ Board to adopt regulations

AN ACT relating to commerce; [requiring certain persons to obtain a license as an
installment lender;] imposing various requirements upon a distributed
generation system financier who finances the purchase of or leases a
distributed generation system or contracts for a power purchase
agreement; revising requirements for solar installation companies that
sell and install distributed generation systems; imposing certain
requirements and restrictions upon persons who generate leads or
referrals to perform work concerning a distributed generation system;
establishing and revising certain requirements for the contents of an
agreement for the provision of a distributed generation system loan, an
agreement for the purchase or lease of a distributed generation system
and a power purchase agreement; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of installment lenders by the
2 Commissioner of Financial Institutions. (Chapter 675 of NRS) [With certain exceptions,
3 existing law prohibits a person from engaging in the business of lending without being
4 licensed by the Commissioner as an installment lender. (NRS 675.060) Section 20 of this bill
5 additionally prohibits a person from engaging in the business of a distributed generation
6 system financier or a manufactured home financier without being licensed by the
7 Commissioner as an installment lender. Section 18 of this bill defines: (1) “distributed
8 generation system financier,” in general, to mean a person who provides a loan to finance the
9 purchase of a distributed generation system, which section 18 designates as a “distributed
10 generation system loan,” leases a distributed generation system or contracts for a power
11 purchase agreement; and (2) “manufactured home financier” to mean, in general, a person
12 who provides a loan to finance the purchase of or leases a manufactured home that is not

13 permanently attached to land.] Section 1 of this bill prohibits an installment lender from
14 engaging in any deceptive trade practice.
15 Existing law imposes certain requirements on solar installation companies that sell and
16 install distributed generation systems in this State. Existing law prescribes certain contractual
17 requirements for an agreement for the purchase or lease of a distributed generation system and
18 a power purchase agreement. (NRS 598.9801-598.9822) Sections [2-17] 23.1-23.3 of this bill
19 impose various requirements on distributed generation system financiers and contractual
20 requirements for an agreement for the provision of a distributed generation system loan [or] ,
21 an agreement for the lease [for] of a distributed generation system [.] and a power purchase
22 agreement. Section 23.11 defines “distributed generation system financier” to mean, in
23 general, a person who provides a distributed generation system loan, leases a distributed
24 generation system or enters into a contract for a power purchase agreement. Section
25 23.12 defines “distributed generation system loan” to mean a loan made for the express
26 purpose of financing the purchase of a distributed generation system or any part thereof.
27 Section [6] 23.13 prohibits a distributed generation system financier from charging a
28 borrower, lessee, host customer or prospective borrower, lessee or host customer certain fees
29 that are attributable to a fee imposed on the financier by a third party in an amount that
30 exceeds the actual amount of the fee charged to the financier by the third party. Section [7]
31 23.14 sets forth certain requirements for the contents of an agreement for the provision of a
32 distributed generation system loan. Section [10] 23.16 requires a distributed generation
33 system financier to provide to a borrower , [or] lessee or host customer a copy of an
34 agreement for the provision of the distributed generation system loan [or] , an agreement for
35 the lease of a distributed generation system or a power purchase agreement immediately
36 after it is signed by the borrower , [or] lessee [.] or host customer.
37 Section [11] 23.17 sets forth certain requirements for a distributed generation system
38 financier with respect to a distributed generation system that will be installed on the roof of a
39 manufactured home.
40 Section [12] 23.18 requires a distributed generation system financier to ensure that any
41 solar installation company that will install a distributed generation system that is leased by
42 [or] the financier or for which a power purchase agreement or agreement for the
43 provision of a distributed generation system loan has been [issued] executed by the financier
44 holds the proper contractor’s license and is acting within the monetary limit of that license. If
45 a distributed generation system financier fails to do so, the loan [or] agreement, lease
46 agreement or power purchase agreement is voidable by the borrower , [or] lessee or host
47 customer for a certain period. Additionally, section [12 provides that] 23.18 prohibits a
48 distributed generation system financier [commits a deceptive trade practice if the financier
49 pays] from providing any money pursuant to a loan [or] agreement, lease agreement or
50 power purchase agreement to a solar installation company that does not have the proper
51 contractor’s license or who is acting outside the monetary limit of such a license. Section [14]
52 23.21 additionally prohibits such a financier from making certain payments to a solar
53 installation company before the distributed generation system has received permission from
54 the appropriate public utility to connect to the power grid or, if the system will not be
55 connected to the power grid, has passed a final inspection and become operational.
56 Section [13] 23.19 requires a distributed generation system financier to make and retain
57 certain recordings with a borrower or lessee. Section 31 of this bill : (1) removes the duty of
58 a solar installation company to make certain recordings concerning a lessee which is
59 imposed in section 23.19 on a distributed generation system financier; and (2) increases,
60 from 4 years to 5 years, the amount of time a solar installation company is required to
61 maintain certain recordings.
62 Section [15] 23.22 prohibits a distributed generation system financier from causing a
63 distributed generation system to be disconnected or otherwise unusable for the failure of a
64 borrower, lessee or host customer to make any payment required under an agreement for the
65 provision of a distributed generation system loan, an agreement for the lease of a distributed
66 generation system or a power purchase agreement unless the borrower, lessee or host
67 customer, as applicable, has failed to make three consecutive monthly payments required
68 under the agreement.
69 Section [17] 23.3 requires a distributed generation system financier to comply with all
70 applicable federal laws and regulations.

Assembly Amendment No. 704 to Senate Bill No. 379 First Reprint Page 5
71 Section [16] 23.23 provides that the assignee of an agreement for the provision of a
72 distributed generation system loan , [or] an agreement for the lease of a distributed generation
73 system or a power purchase agreement is subject to all claims and defenses of the borrower
74 , [or] lessee or host customer against the distributed generation system financier who
75 provided the loan or entered into the lease [.] or power purchase agreement. Under section
76 [16,] 23.23, the liability of the assignee is limited to the amount owed to the assignee at the
77 time the claim or defense is asserted against assignee.
78 Section [21 of this bill revises provisions of existing law prohibiting a licensed
79 installment lender from advertising certain false, misleading or deceptive statements or
80 representations to specify that the prohibition also applies to applicable leases and specifically
81 includes such statements made by] 23.24 prohibits a distributed generation system financier
82 [with] from advertising any false, misleading or deceptive statement with regard to any
83 rate that may be charged by a public utility for electricity. [(NRS 675.280)
84 Section 22 of this bill revises provisions of existing law relating to retail installment sales
85 so that such provisions continue to apply to distributed generation system financiers and
86 manufactured home financiers who engage in certain activities. (NRS 97.125)]
87 Under existing law, a lessee or purchaser of a distributed generation system or a host
88 customer has the right to rescind the lease or purchase agreement 3 business days after the
89 agreement is signed. (NRS 598.98216) Sections [7, 9,] 23.14, 23.15, [26-29] 26-30 and 32 of
90 this bill provide a borrower, lessee , [or] purchaser or host customer the right to rescind an
91 agreement for the provision of a distributed generation system loan , [or] a lease or purchase
92 agreement [:] or a power purchase agreement: (1) 3 business days after signing, if the
93 person is [under] less than 60 years of age; and (2) 10 business days after signing, if the
94 person is 60 years of age or older. Sections [8, 9,] 23.15, 23.2 , 26-30 and 32 of this bill also
95 provide a borrower, lessee , [or] purchaser or host customer the right to rescind such an
96 agreement if the results of a required on-site physical survey of the premises conducted after
97 the execution of the agreement would require the alteration of the terms of the agreement to
98 increase the price of the distributed generation system or , with certain exceptions, change
99 the type of equipment used for the distributed generation system.
100 Section 23.4 of this bill imposes certain requirements and restrictions upon a person who
101 generates leads or referrals to perform work concerning a distributed generation system.
102 Section 23.6 of this bill prohibits a solar installation company from accepting any payment as
103 an initial down payment or deposit to be paid for the installation of a distributed generation
104 system that exceeds a certain amount. Section 23.8 of this bill prohibits a solar installation
105 company, a person who generates leads or referrals to perform work concerning a distributed
106 generation system or a distributed generation system financier from engaging in certain
107 conduct, including, without limitation, certain specified deceptive or fraudulent conduct in
108 connection with the lease or purchase of a distributed generation system or the contracting for
109 a power purchase agreement.
110 Section 24 of this bill makes a conforming change so that the definitions applicable to the
111 provisions of existing law governing distributed generation systems apply to sections [23.2-
112 23.8.] 23.1-23.8. Section 33 of this bill provides that a violation of sections [23.2-23.8] 23.1-
113 23.8 constitutes a deceptive trade practice and consumer fraud.
114 Sections [7,] 23.6, 27 , [and] 29 and 30 also provide that a borrower, lessee , [or]
115 purchaser or host customer is not required to pay any money to a distributed generation
116 system financier or solar installation company , except for an initial deposit or down
117 payment that does not exceed a certain amount, before the distributed generation system
118 has received permission from the appropriate public utility to connect to the power grid or, if
119 the system will not be connected to the power grid, has passed a final inspection and become
120 operational.
121 Sections 27 and 29 additionally impose certain duties on a solar installation company if a
122 distributed generation system fails to meet the estimated amount of production in the first year
123 of operation of the system. Sections [7,] 23.14, 29 and 30 of this bill require an agreement for
124 the provision of a distributed generation system loan, an agreement for the lease of a
125 distributed generation system or a power purchase agreement to contain information
126 concerning whether a borrower, lessee or host customer may transfer the agreement in the
127 event of a sale of the property to which the distributed generation system is affixed and the
128 process to complete a payoff of any amount owed under the agreement. Sections 27, 29 and

Assembly Amendment No. 704 to Senate Bill No. 379 First Reprint Page 6
129 30 additionally require certain other provisions and disclosures to be included in an agreement
130 for the purchase or lease of a distributed generation system and a power purchase agreement.
131 Existing law excludes from the definition of “solar installation company” a person who
132 generates leads or referrals to perform work concerning a distributed generation system, if the
133 person’s activities are limited to certain specified activities. (NRS 598.9808) Section 25 of
134 this bill requires such a person to collect only the name, contact information and information
135 concerning the power bill of a prospective purchaser or lessee. Section 25 additionally
136 prohibits such a person from engaging in advertising through any media other than print
137 media.
138 Section 23.7 of this bill authorizes the State Contractors’ Board to adopt regulations
139 that require any employee of a solar installation company to submit to a background
140 check and which set forth requirements for such background checks.
141 Sections [7 and] 23.14, 26 and 29.5 of this bill require an agreement for the provision of
142 a distributed generation system loan and the cover page for an agreement for the lease of a
143 distributed generation system or power purchase agreement to prominently display at the
144 top of the agreement or cover page the length of the term of the [loan or lease] agreement and
145 a description of the consequences if the borrower , [or] lessee or host customer dies during

148 or purchase of a distributed generation system or a power purchase agreement to contain
149 certain information relating to the amount paid by the company for certain leads and referrals
150 and certain notice relating to the terms of the agreement. Sections 26, 28 and 29.5 [of this
151 bill] also require such a cover page to contain a statement providing certain information
152 concerning financial covenants and restrictions that may affect the future sale or
153 transferability of the property of the purchaser, lessee or host customer.
