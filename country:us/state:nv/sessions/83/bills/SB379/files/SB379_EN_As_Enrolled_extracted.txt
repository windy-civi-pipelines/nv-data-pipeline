Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of installment lenders by
the Commissioner of Financial Institutions. (Chapter 675 of NRS) Section 1 of this
bill prohibits an installment lender from engaging in any deceptive trade practice.
Existing law imposes certain requirements on solar installation companies that
sell and install distributed generation systems in this State. Existing law prescribes
certain contractual requirements for an agreement for the purchase or lease of a
distributed generation system and a power purchase agreement. (NRS 598.9801-

Section 2:

distributed generation system financiers and contractual requirements for an
agreement for the provision of a distributed generation system loan, an agreement
for the lease of a distributed generation system and a power purchase agreement.

Section 3:
Section 23.11 defines “distributed generation system financier” to mean, in general,
a person who provides a distributed generation system loan, leases a distributed
generation system or enters into a contract for a power purchase agreement. Section

Section 4:
23.12 defines “distributed generation system loan” to mean a loan made for the

Section 6:
Section 23.17 sets forth certain requirements for a distributed generation
system financier with respect to a distributed generation system that will be
installed on the roof of a manufactured home.

Section 7:
Section 23.18 requires a distributed generation system financier to ensure that
any solar installation company that will install a distributed generation system that
is leased by the financier or for which a power purchase agreement or agreement
for the provision of a distributed generation system loan has been executed by the
financier holds the proper contractor’s license and is acting within the monetary
limit of that license. If a distributed generation system financier fails to do so, the
loan agreement, lease agreement or power purchase agreement is voidable by the
borrower, lessee or host customer for a certain period. Additionally, section 23.18
prohibits a distributed generation system financier from providing any money
pursuant to a loan agreement, lease agreement or power purchase agreement to a
solar installation company that does not have the proper contractor’s license or who
is acting outside the monetary limit of such a license. Section 23.21 additionally
prohibits such a financier from making certain payments to a solar installation
company before the distributed generation system has received permission from the
appropriate public utility to connect to the power grid or, if the system will not be
connected to the power grid, has passed a final inspection and become operational.

Section 8:
Section 23.19 requires a distributed generation system financier to make and
retain certain recordings with a borrower or lessee. Section 31 of this bill: (1)
removes the duty of a solar installation company to make certain recordings
concerning a lessee which is imposed in section 23.19 on a distributed generation
system financier; and (2) increases, from 4 years to 5 years, the amount of time a
solar installation company is required to maintain certain recordings.

Section 9:
Section 23.22 prohibits a distributed generation system financier from causing
a distributed generation system to be disconnected or otherwise unusable for the
failure of a borrower, lessee or host customer to make any payment required under
an agreement for the provision of a distributed generation system loan, an
agreement for the lease of a distributed generation system or a power purchase
agreement unless the borrower, lessee or host customer, as applicable, has failed to
make three consecutive monthly payments required under the agreement.

Section 10:
Section 23.3 requires a distributed generation system financier to comply with
all applicable federal laws and regulations.

Section 11:
Section 23.23 provides that the assignee of an agreement for the provision of a
distributed generation system loan, an agreement for the lease of a distributed
generation system or a power purchase agreement is subject to all claims and
defenses of the borrower, lessee or host customer against the distributed generation
system financier who provided the loan or entered into the lease or power purchase
agreement. Under section 23.23, the liability of the assignee is limited to the
amount owed to the assignee at the time the claim or defense is asserted against
assignee.

Section 12:
Section 23.24 prohibits a distributed generation system financier from
advertising any false, misleading or deceptive statement with regard to any rate that
may be charged by a public utility for electricity.
Under existing law, a lessee or purchaser of a distributed generation system or a
host customer has the right to rescind the lease or purchase agreement 3 business
days after the agreement is signed. (NRS 598.98216) Sections 23.14, 23.15, 26-30
and 32 of this bill provide a borrower, lessee, purchaser or host customer the right
to rescind an agreement for the provision of a distributed generation system loan, a
lease or purchase agreement or a power purchase agreement: (1) 3 business days
after signing, if the person is less than 60 years of age; and (2) 10 business days

and 32 of this bill also provide a borrower, lessee, purchaser or host customer the
right to rescind such an agreement if the results of a required on-site physical
survey of the premises conducted after the execution of the agreement would
require the alteration of the terms of the agreement to increase the price of the
distributed generation system or, with certain exceptions, change the type of
equipment used for the distributed generation system.

Section 13:
Section 23.4 of this bill imposes certain requirements and restrictions upon a
person who generates leads or referrals to perform work concerning a distributed
generation system. Section 23.6 of this bill prohibits a solar installation company
from accepting any payment as an initial down payment or deposit to be paid for
the installation of a distributed generation system that exceeds a certain amount.

Section 14:
Section 23.8 of this bill prohibits a solar installation company, a person who
generates leads or referrals to perform work concerning a distributed generation
system or a distributed generation system financier from engaging in certain
conduct, including, without limitation, certain specified deceptive or fraudulent
conduct in connection with the lease or purchase of a distributed generation system
or the contracting for a power purchase agreement.

Section 15:
Section 24 of this bill makes a conforming change so that the definitions
applicable to the provisions of existing law governing distributed generation
systems apply to sections 23.1-23.8. Section 33 of this bill provides that a violation
of sections 23.1-23.8 constitutes a deceptive trade practice and consumer fraud.

Section 16:
Sections 23.6, 27, 29 and 30 also provide that a borrower, lessee, purchaser or
host customer is not required to pay any money to a distributed generation system
financier or solar installation company, except for an initial deposit or down
payment that does not exceed a certain amount, before the distributed generation
system has received permission from the appropriate public utility to connect to the
power grid or, if the system will not be connected to the power grid, has passed a
final inspection and become operational.

Section 17:
Sections 27 and 29 additionally impose certain duties on a solar installation
company if a distributed generation system fails to meet the estimated amount of
production in the first year of operation of the system. Sections 23.14, 29 and 30 of
this bill require an agreement for the provision of a distributed generation system
loan, an agreement for the lease of a distributed generation system or a power
purchase agreement to contain information concerning whether a borrower, lessee
or host customer may transfer the agreement in the event of a sale of the property to
which the distributed generation system is affixed and the process to complete a
payoff of any amount owed under the agreement. Sections 27, 29 and 30
additionally require certain other provisions and disclosures to be included in an
agreement for the purchase or lease of a distributed generation system and a power
purchase agreement.
Existing law excludes from the definition of “solar installation company” a
person who generates leads or referrals to perform work concerning a distributed
generation system, if the person’s activities are limited to certain specified
activities. (NRS 598.9808) Section 25 of this bill requires such a person to collect
only the name, contact information and information concerning the power bill of a
prospective purchaser or lessee. Section 25 additionally prohibits such a person
from engaging in advertising through any media other than print media.

Section 18:
Section 23.7 of this bill authorizes the State Contractors’ Board to adopt
regulations that require any employee of a solar installation company to submit to a
background check and which set forth requirements for such background checks.

Raw Text:
Senate Bill No. 379–Senators Doñate; Cruz-Crawford,
Daly, Flores, Steinbeck and Stone
Joint Sponsors: Assemblymembers Moore; and Watts
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to commerce; imposing various requirements
upon a distributed generation system financier who finances
the purchase of or leases a distributed generation system or
contracts for a power purchase agreement; revising
requirements for solar installation companies that sell and
install distributed generation systems; imposing certain
requirements and restrictions upon persons who generate
leads or referrals to perform work concerning a distributed
generation system; establishing and revising certain
requirements for the contents of an agreement for the
provision of a distributed generation system loan, an
agreement for the purchase or lease of a distributed
generation system and a power purchase agreement; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of installment lenders by
the Commissioner of Financial Institutions. (Chapter 675 of NRS) Section 1 of this
bill prohibits an installment lender from engaging in any deceptive trade practice.
Existing law imposes certain requirements on solar installation companies that
sell and install distributed generation systems in this State. Existing law prescribes
certain contractual requirements for an agreement for the purchase or lease of a
distributed generation system and a power purchase agreement. (NRS 598.9801-
598.9822) Sections 23.1-23.3 of this bill impose various requirements on
distributed generation system financiers and contractual requirements for an
agreement for the provision of a distributed generation system loan, an agreement
for the lease of a distributed generation system and a power purchase agreement.
Section 23.11 defines “distributed generation system financier” to mean, in general,
a person who provides a distributed generation system loan, leases a distributed
generation system or enters into a contract for a power purchase agreement. Section
23.12 defines “distributed generation system loan” to mean a loan made for the
express purpose of financing the purchase of a distributed generation system or any
part thereof.
Section 23.13 prohibits a distributed generation system financier from charging
a borrower, lessee, host customer or prospective borrower, lessee or host customer
certain fees that are attributable to a fee imposed on the financier by a third party in
an amount that exceeds the actual amount of the fee charged to the financier by the
third party. Section 23.14 sets forth certain requirements for the contents of an
agreement for the provision of a distributed generation system loan. Section 23.16
requires a distributed generation system financier to provide to a borrower, lessee
or host customer a copy of an agreement for the provision of the distributed
generation system loan, an agreement for the lease of a distributed generation
system or a power purchase agreement immediately after it is signed by the
borrower, lessee or host customer.

83rd Session (2025)

– 2 –
Section 23.17 sets forth certain requirements for a distributed generation
system financier with respect to a distributed generation system that will be
installed on the roof of a manufactured home.
Section 23.18 requires a distributed generation system financier to ensure that
any solar installation company that will install a distributed generation system that
is leased by the financier or for which a power purchase agreement or agreement
for the provision of a distributed generation system loan has been executed by the
financier holds the proper contractor’s license and is acting within the monetary
limit of that license. If a distributed generation system financier fails to do so, the
loan agreement, lease agreement or power purchase agreement is voidable by the
borrower, lessee or host customer for a certain period. Additionally, section 23.18
prohibits a distributed generation system financier from providing any money
pursuant to a loan agreement, lease agreement or power purchase agreement to a
solar installation company that does not have the proper contractor’s license or who
is acting outside the monetary limit of such a license. Section 23.21 additionally
prohibits such a financier from making certain payments to a solar installation
company before the distributed generation system has received permission from the
appropriate public utility to connect to the power grid or, if the system will not be
connected to the power grid, has passed a final inspection and become operational.
Section 23.19 requires a distributed generation system financier to make and
retain certain recordings with a borrower or lessee. Section 31 of this bill: (1)
removes the duty of a solar installation company to make certain recordings
concerning a lessee which is imposed in section 23.19 on a distributed generation
system financier; and (2) increases, from 4 years to 5 years, the amount of time a
solar installation company is required to maintain certain recordings.
Section 23.22 prohibits a distributed generation system financier from causing
a distributed generation system to be disconnected or otherwise unusable for the
failure of a borrower, lessee or host customer to make any payment required under
an agreement for the provision of a distributed generation system loan, an
agreement for the lease of a distributed generation system or a power purchase
agreement unless the borrower, lessee or host customer, as applicable, has failed to
make three consecutive monthly payments required under the agreement.
Section 23.3 requires a distributed generation system financier to comply with
all applicable federal laws and regulations.
Section 23.23 provides that the assignee of an agreement for the provision of a
distributed generation system loan, an agreement for the lease of a distributed
generation system or a power purchase agreement is subject to all claims and
defenses of the borrower, lessee or host customer against the distributed generation
system financier who provided the loan or entered into the lease or power purchase
agreement. Under section 23.23, the liability of the assignee is limited to the
amount owed to the assignee at the time the claim or defense is asserted against
assignee.
Section 23.24 prohibits a distributed generation system financier from
advertising any false, misleading or deceptive statement with regard to any rate that
may be charged by a public utility for electricity.
Under existing law, a lessee or purchaser of a distributed generation system or a
host customer has the right to rescind the lease or purchase agreement 3 business
days after the agreement is signed. (NRS 598.98216) Sections 23.14, 23.15, 26-30
and 32 of this bill provide a borrower, lessee, purchaser or host customer the right
to rescind an agreement for the provision of a distributed generation system loan, a
lease or purchase agreement or a power purchase agreement: (1) 3 business days

and 32 of this bill also provide a borrower, lessee, purchaser or host customer the
right to rescind such an agreement if the results of a required on-site physical
survey of the premises conducted after the execution of the agreement would
require the alteration of the terms of the agreement to increase the price of the
distributed generation system or, with certain exceptions, change the type of
equipment used for the distributed generation system.
Section 23.4 of this bill imposes certain requirements and restrictions upon a
person who generates leads or referrals to perform work concerning a distributed
generation system. Section 23.6 of this bill prohibits a solar installation company
from accepting any payment as an initial down payment or deposit to be paid for
the installation of a distributed generation system that exceeds a certain amount.
Section 23.8 of this bill prohibits a solar installation company, a person who
generates leads or referrals to perform work concerning a distributed generation
system or a distributed generation system financier from engaging in certain
conduct, including, without limitation, certain specified deceptive or fraudulent
conduct in connection with the lease or purchase of a distributed generation system
or the contracting for a power purchase agreement.
Section 24 of this bill makes a conforming change so that the definitions
applicable to the provisions of existing law governing distributed generation
systems apply to sections 23.1-23.8. Section 33 of this bill provides that a violation
of sections 23.1-23.8 constitutes a deceptive trade practice and consumer fraud.
Sections 23.6, 27, 29 and 30 also provide that a borrower, lessee, purchaser or
host customer is not required to pay any money to a distributed generation system
financier or solar installation company, except for an initial deposit or down
payment that does not exceed a certain amount, before the distributed generation
system has received permission from the appropriate public utility to connect to the
power grid or, if the system will not be connected to the power grid, has passed a
final inspection and become operational.
Sections 27 and 29 additionally impose certain duties on a solar installation
company if a distributed generation system fails to meet the estimated amount of
production in the first year of operation of the system. Sections 23.14, 29 and 30 of
this bill require an agreement for the provision of a distributed generation system
loan, an agreement for the lease of a distributed generation system or a power
purchase agreement to contain information concerning whether a borrower, lessee
or host customer may transfer the agreement in the event of a sale of the property to
which the distributed generation system is affixed and the process to complete a
payoff of any amount owed under the agreement. Sections 27, 29 and 30
additionally require certain other provisions and disclosures to be included in an
agreement for the purchase or lease of a distributed generation system and a power
purchase agreement.
Existing law excludes from the definition of “solar installation company” a
person who generates leads or referrals to perform work concerning a distributed
generation system, if the person’s activities are limited to certain specified
activities. (NRS 598.9808) Section 25 of this bill requires such a person to collect
only the name, contact information and information concerning the power bill of a
prospective purchaser or lessee. Section 25 additionally prohibits such a person
from engaging in advertising through any media other than print media.
Section 23.7 of this bill authorizes the State Contractors’ Board to adopt
regulations that require any employee of a solar installation company to submit to a
background check and which set forth requirements for such background checks.
Sections 23.14, 26 and 29.5 of this bill require an agreement for the provision
of a distributed generation system loan and the cover page for an agreement for the
lease of a distributed generation system or power purchase agreement to
-
83rd Session (2025)

prominently display at the top of the agreement or cover page the length of the term
of the agreement and a description of the consequences if the borrower, lessee or
host customer dies during the term of the agreement.
Sections 26, 28 and 29.5 of this bill require the cover page of an agreement for
the lease or purchase of a distributed generation system or a power purchase
agreement to contain certain information relating to the amount paid by the
company for certain leads and referrals and certain notice relating to the terms of
the agreement. Sections 26, 28 and 29.5 also require such a cover page to contain a
statement providing certain information concerning financial covenants and
restrictions that may affect the future sale or transferability of the property of the
purchaser, lessee or host customer.
