Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of installment lenders by
2 the Commissioner of Financial Institutions. (Chapter 675 of NRS) With certain
3 exceptions, existing law prohibits a person from engaging in the business of lending
4 without being licensed by the Commissioner as an installment lender. (NRS
5 675.060) Section 20 of this bill additionally prohibits a person from engaging in the
6 business of a distributed generation system financier or a manufactured home
7 financier without being licensed by the Commissioner as an installment lender.
8 Section 18 of this bill defines: (1) “distributed generation system financier,” in
9 general, to mean a person who provides a loan to finance the purchase of a
10 distributed generation system, which section 18 designates as a “distributed
11 generation system loan,” leases a distributed generation system or contracts for a
12 power purchase agreement; and (2) “manufactured home financier” to mean, in
13 general, a person who provides a loan to finance the purchase of or leases a
14 manufactured home that is not permanently attached to land.
15 Existing law imposes certain requirements on solar installation companies that
16 sell and install distributed generation systems in this State. Existing law prescribes
17 certain contractual requirements for an agreement for the purchase or lease of a
18 distributed generation system and a power purchase agreement. (NRS 598.9801-
19 598.9822) Sections 2-17 of this bill impose various requirements on distributed
20 generation system financiers and contractual requirements for an agreement for the
21 provision of a distributed generation system loan or lease for a distributed
22 generation system.
23 Section 6 prohibits a distributed generation system financier from charging a
24 borrower, lessee, host customer or prospective borrower, lessee or host customer
25 certain fees that are attributable to a fee imposed on the financier by a third party in
26 an amount that exceeds the actual amount of the fee charged to the financier by the
27 third party. Section 7 sets forth certain requirements for the contents of an
28 agreement for the provision of a distributed generation system loan. Section 10
29 requires a distributed generation system financier to provide to a borrower or lessee
30 a copy of an agreement for the provision of the distributed generation system loan
31 or lease of a distributed generation system immediately after it is signed by the
32 borrower or lessee.
33 Section 11 sets forth certain requirements for a distributed generation system
34 financier with respect to a distributed generation system that will be installed on the
35 roof of a manufactured home.
36 Section 12 requires a distributed generation system financier to ensure that any
37 solar installation company that will install a distributed generation system that is
38 leased by or for which a distributed generation system loan has been issued by the
39 financier holds the proper contractor’s license and is acting within the monetary
40 limit of that license. If a distributed generation system financier fails to do so, the
41 loan or lease agreement is voidable by the borrower or lessee for a certain period.
42 Additionally, section 12 provides that a distributed generation system financier
43 commits a deceptive trade practice if the financier pays any money pursuant to a
44 loan or lease agreement to a solar installation company that does not have the
45 proper contractor’s license or who is acting outside the monetary limit of such a
46 license. Section 14 additionally prohibits such a financier from making certain
47 payments to a solar installation company before the distributed generation system
48 has received permission from the appropriate public utility to connect to the power
49 grid or, if the system will not be connected to the power grid, has passed a final
50 inspection and become operational.
51 Section 13 requires a distributed generation system financier to make and retain
52 certain recordings with a borrower or lessee. Section 31 of this bill increases, from
53 4 years to 5 years, the amount of time a solar installation company is required to
54 maintain certain recordings.

55 Section 15 prohibits a distributed generation system financier from causing a
56 distributed generation system to be disconnected or otherwise unusable for failure
57 of a borrower, lessee or host customer to make any payment required under an
58 agreement for the provision of a distributed generation system loan, an agreement
59 for the lease of a distributed generation system or a power purchase agreement
60 unless the borrower, lessee or host customer, as applicable, has failed to make three
61 consecutive monthly payments required under the agreement.
62 Section 17 requires a distributed generation system financier to comply with all
63 applicable federal laws and regulations.
64 Section 16 provides that the assignee of an agreement for the provision of a
65 distributed generation system loan or an agreement for the lease of a distributed
66 generation system is subject to all claims and defenses of the borrower or lessee
67 against the distributed generation system financier who provided the loan or entered
68 into the lease. Under section 16, the liability of the assignee is limited to the
69 amount owed to the assignee at the time the claim or defense is asserted against
70 assignee.
71 Section 21 of this bill revises provisions of existing law prohibiting a licensed
72 installment lender from advertising certain false, misleading or deceptive
73 statements or representations to specify that the prohibition also applies to
74 applicable leases and specifically includes such statements made by a distributed
75 generation system financier with regard to any rate that may be charged by a public
76 utility for electricity. (NRS 675.280)
77 Section 22 of this bill revises provisions of existing law relating to retail
78 installment sales so that such provisions continue to apply to distributed generation
79 system financiers and manufactured home financiers who engage in certain
80 activities. (NRS 97.125)
81 Under existing law, a lessee or purchaser of a distributed generation system has
82 the right to rescind the lease or purchase agreement 3 business days after the
83 agreement is signed. (NRS 598.98216) Sections 7, 9, 26-29 and 32 of this bill
84 provide a borrower, lessee or purchaser the right to rescind an agreement for the
85 provision of a distributed generation system loan or a lease or purchase agreement:
86 (1) three business days after signing, if the person is under 60 years of age; and (2)
87 ten business days after signing, if the person is 60 years of age or older. Sections 8,
88 9, 23.2 and 32 of this bill also provide a borrower, lessee or purchaser the right to
89 rescind such an agreement if the results of a required on-site physical survey of the
90 premises conducted after the execution of the agreement would require the
91 alteration of the terms of the agreement to increase the price of the distributed
92 generation system or change the type of equipment used for the distributed
93 generation system.
94 Section 23.4 of this bill imposes certain requirements and restrictions upon a
95 person who generates leads or referrals to perform work concerning a distributed
96 generation system. Section 23.6 of this bill prohibits a solar installation company
97 from accepting any payment as an initial down payment or deposit to be paid for
98 the installation of a distributed generation system that exceeds a certain amount.
99 Section 23.8 of this bill prohibits a solar installation company, a person who
100 generates leads or referrals to perform work concerning a distributed generation
101 system or a distributed generation system financier from engaging in certain
102 conduct, including, without limitation, certain specified deceptive or fraudulent
103 conduct in connection with the lease or purchase of a distributed generation system
104 or the contracting for a power purchase agreement.
105 Section 24 of this bill makes a conforming change so that the definitions
106 applicable to the provisions of existing law governing distributed generation
107 systems apply to sections 23.2-23.8. Section 33 of this bill provides that a violation
108 of sections 23.2-23.8 constitutes a deceptive trade practice and consumer fraud.

109 Sections 7, 27 and 29 also provide that a borrower, lessee or purchaser is not
110 required to pay any money to a distributed generation system financier or solar
111 installation company before the distributed generation system has received
112 permission from the appropriate public utility to connect to the power grid or, if the
113 system will not be connected to the power grid, has passed a final inspection and
114 become operational.
115 Sections 27 and 29 additionally impose certain duties on a solar installation
116 company if a distributed generation system fails to meet the estimated amount of
117 production in the first year of operation of the system. Sections 7, 29 and 30 of this
118 bill require an agreement for the provision of a distributed generation system loan,
119 an agreement for the lease of a distributed generation system or a power purchase
120 agreement to contain information concerning whether a borrower, lessee or host
121 customer may transfer the agreement in the event of a sale of the property to which
122 the distributed generation system is affixed and the process to complete a payoff of
123 any amount owed under the agreement. Sections 27, 29 and 30 additionally require
124 certain other provisions and disclosures to be included in an agreement for the
125 purchase or lease of a distributed generation system and a power purchase
126 agreement.
127 Existing law excludes from the definition of “solar installation company” a
128 person who generates leads or referrals to perform work concerning a distributed
129 generation system, if the person’s activities are limited to certain specified
130 activities. (NRS 598.9808) Section 25 of this bill requires such a person to collect
131 only the name, contact information and information concerning the power bill of a
132 prospective purchaser or lessee. Section 25 additionally prohibits such a person
133 from engaging in advertising through any media other than print media.
134 Sections 7 and 26 require an agreement for the provision of a distributed
135 generation system loan and the cover page for an agreement for the lease of a
136 distributed generation system to prominently display at the top of the agreement or
137 cover page the length of the term of the loan or lease and a description of the
138 consequences if the borrower or lessee dies during the term of the loan or lease.
139 Sections 26, 28 and 29.5 of this bill require the cover page of an agreement for
140 the lease or purchase of a distributed generation system or a power purchase
141 agreement to contain certain information relating to the amount paid by the
142 company for certain leads and referrals and certain notice relating to the terms of

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of installment lenders by
2 the Commissioner of Financial Institutions. (Chapter 675 of NRS) With certain
3 exceptions, existing law prohibits a person from engaging in the business of lending
4 without being licensed by the Commissioner as an installment lender. (NRS
5 675.060) Section 20 of this bill additionally prohibits a person from engaging in the
6 business of a distributed generation system financier or a manufactured home
7 financier without being licensed by the Commissioner as an installment lender.
8 Section 18 of this bill defines: (1) “distributed generation system financier,” in
9 general, to mean a person who provides a loan to finance the purchase of a
10 distributed generation system, which section 18 designates as a “distributed
11 generation system loan,” leases a distributed generation system or contracts for a
12 power purchase agreement; and (2) “manufactured home financier” to mean, in
13 general, a person who provides a loan to finance the purchase of or leases a
14 manufactured home that is not permanently attached to land.
15 Existing law imposes certain requirements on solar installation companies that
16 sell and install distributed generation systems in this State. Existing law prescribes
17 certain contractual requirements for an agreement for the purchase or lease of a
18 distributed generation system and a power purchase agreement. (NRS 598.9801-
19 598.9822) Sections 2-17 of this bill impose various requirements on distributed
20 generation system financiers and contractual requirements for an agreement for the
21 provision of a distributed generation system loan or lease for a distributed
22 generation system.
23 Section 6 prohibits a distributed generation system financier from charging a
24 borrower, lessee, host customer or prospective borrower, lessee or host customer
25 certain fees that are attributable to a fee imposed on the financier by a third party in
26 an amount that exceeds the actual amount of the fee charged to the financier by the
27 third party. Section 7 sets forth certain requirements for the contents of an
28 agreement for the provision of a distributed generation system loan. Section 10
29 requires a distributed generation system financier to provide to a borrower or lessee
30 a copy of an agreement for the provision of the distributed generation system loan
31 or lease of a distributed generation system immediately after it is signed by the
32 borrower or lessee.
33 Section 11 sets forth certain requirements for a distributed generation system
34 financier with respect to a distributed generation system that will be installed on the
35 roof of a manufactured home.
36 Section 12 requires a distributed generation system financier to ensure that any
37 solar installation company that will install a distributed generation system that is
38 leased by or for which a distributed generation system loan has been issued by the
39 financier holds the proper contractor’s license and is acting within the monetary
40 limit of that license. If a distributed generation system financier fails to do so, the
41 loan or lease agreement is voidable by the borrower or lessee for a certain period.
42 Additionally, section 12 provides that a distributed generation system financier
43 commits a deceptive trade practice if the financier pays any money pursuant to a
44 loan or lease agreement to a solar installation company that does not have the
45 proper contractor’s license or who is acting outside the monetary limit of such a
46 license. Section 14 additionally prohibits such a financier from making certain
47 payments to a solar installation company before the distributed generation system
48 has received permission from the appropriate public utility to connect to the power
49 grid or, if the system will not be connected to the power grid, has passed a final
50 inspection and become operational.
51 Section 13 requires a distributed generation system financier to make and retain
52 certain recordings with a borrower or lessee. Section 31 of this bill increases, from
53 4 years to 5 years, the amount of time a solar installation company is required to
54 maintain certain recordings.

– 3 –
55 Section 15 prohibits a distributed generation system financier from causing a
56 distributed generation system to be disconnected or otherwise unusable for failure
57 of a borrower, lessee or host customer to make any payment required under an
58 agreement for the provision of a distributed generation system loan, an agreement
59 for the lease of a distributed generation system or a power purchase agreement
60 unless the borrower, lessee or host customer, as applicable, has failed to make three
61 consecutive monthly payments required under the agreement.
62 Section 17 requires a distributed generation system financier to comply with all
63 applicable federal laws and regulations.
64 Section 16 provides that the assignee of an agreement for the provision of a
65 distributed generation system loan or an agreement for the lease of a distributed
66 generation system is subject to all claims and defenses of the borrower or lessee
67 against the distributed generation system financier who provided the loan or entered
68 into the lease. Under section 16, the liability of the assignee is limited to the
69 amount owed to the assignee at the time the claim or defense is asserted against
70 assignee.
71 Section 21 of this bill revises provisions of existing law prohibiting a licensed
72 installment lender from advertising certain false, misleading or deceptive
73 statements or representations to specify that the prohibition also applies to
74 applicable leases and specifically includes such statements made by a distributed
75 generation system financier with regard to any rate that may be charged by a public
76 utility for electricity. (NRS 675.280)
77 Section 22 of this bill revises provisions of existing law relating to retail
78 installment sales so that such provisions continue to apply to distributed generation
79 system financiers and manufactured home financiers who engage in certain
80 activities. (NRS 97.125)
81 Under existing law, a lessee or purchaser of a distributed generation system has
82 the right to rescind the lease or purchase agreement 3 business days after the
83 agreement is signed. (NRS 598.98216) Sections 7, 9, 26-29 and 32 of this bill
84 provide a borrower, lessee or purchaser the right to rescind an agreement for the
85 provision of a distributed generation system loan or a lease or purchase agreement:
86 (1) three business days after signing, if the person is under 60 years of age; and (2)
87 ten business days after signing, if the person is 60 years of age or older. Sections 8,
88 9, 23.2 and 32 of this bill also provide a borrower, lessee or purchaser the right to
89 rescind such an agreement if the results of a required on-site physical survey of the
90 premises conducted after the execution of the agreement would require the
91 alteration of the terms of the agreement to increase the price of the distributed
92 generation system or change the type of equipment used for the distributed
93 generation system.
94 Section 23.4 of this bill imposes certain requirements and restrictions upon a
95 person who generates leads or referrals to perform work concerning a distributed
96 generation system. Section 23.6 of this bill prohibits a solar installation company
97 from accepting any payment as an initial down payment or deposit to be paid for
98 the installation of a distributed generation system that exceeds a certain amount.
99 Section 23.8 of this bill prohibits a solar installation company, a person who
100 generates leads or referrals to perform work concerning a distributed generation
101 system or a distributed generation system financier from engaging in certain
102 conduct, including, without limitation, certain specified deceptive or fraudulent
103 conduct in connection with the lease or purchase of a distributed generation system
104 or the contracting for a power purchase agreement.
105 Section 24 of this bill makes a conforming change so that the definitions
106 applicable to the provisions of existing law governing distributed generation
107 systems apply to sections 23.2-23.8. Section 33 of this bill provides that a violation
108 of sections 23.2-23.8 constitutes a deceptive trade practice and consumer fraud.

109 Sections 7, 27 and 29 also provide that a borrower, lessee or purchaser is not
110 required to pay any money to a distributed generation system financier or solar
111 installation company before the distributed generation system has received
112 permission from the appropriate public utility to connect to the power grid or, if the
113 system will not be connected to the power grid, has passed a final inspection and
114 become operational.
115 Sections 27 and 29 additionally impose certain duties on a solar installation
116 company if a distributed generation system fails to meet the estimated amount of
117 production in the first year of operation of the system. Sections 7, 29 and 30 of this
118 bill require an agreement for the provision of a distributed generation system loan,
119 an agreement for the lease of a distributed generation system or a power purchase
120 agreement to contain information concerning whether a borrower, lessee or host
121 customer may transfer the agreement in the event of a sale of the property to which
122 the distributed generation system is affixed and the process to complete a payoff of
123 any amount owed under the agreement. Sections 27, 29 and 30 additionally require
124 certain other provisions and disclosures to be included in an agreement for the
125 purchase or lease of a distributed generation system and a power purchase
126 agreement.
127 Existing law excludes from the definition of “solar installation company” a
128 person who generates leads or referrals to perform work concerning a distributed
129 generation system, if the person’s activities are limited to certain specified
130 activities. (NRS 598.9808) Section 25 of this bill requires such a person to collect
131 only the name, contact information and information concerning the power bill of a
132 prospective purchaser or lessee. Section 25 additionally prohibits such a person
133 from engaging in advertising through any media other than print media.
134 Sections 7 and 26 require an agreement for the provision of a distributed
135 generation system loan and the cover page for an agreement for the lease of a
136 distributed generation system to prominently display at the top of the agreement or
137 cover page the length of the term of the loan or lease and a description of the
138 consequences if the borrower or lessee dies during the term of the loan or lease.
139 Sections 26, 28 and 29.5 of this bill require the cover page of an agreement for
140 the lease or purchase of a distributed generation system or a power purchase
141 agreement to contain certain information relating to the amount paid by the
142 company for certain leads and referrals and certain notice relating to the terms of
143 the agreement. Sections 26, 28 and 29.5 of this bill also require such a cover page
144 to contain a statement providing certain information concerning financial covenants
145 and restrictions that may affect the future sale or transferability of the property of
146 the purchaser, lessee or host customer.
