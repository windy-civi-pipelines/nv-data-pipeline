6 certain contractual requirements for an agreement for the purchase or lease of a
-

– 2 –
7 distributed generation system and a power purchase agreement. (NRS 598.9801-
8 598.9822) Sections 23.1-23.3 of this bill impose various requirements on
9 distributed generation system financiers and contractual requirements for an
10 agreement for the provision of a distributed generation system loan, an agreement
11 for the lease of a distributed generation system and a power purchase agreement.
12 Section 23.11 defines “distributed generation system financier” to mean, in general,
13 a person who provides a distributed generation system loan, leases a distributed
14 generation system or enters into a contract for a power purchase agreement. Section
15 23.12 defines “distributed generation system loan” to mean a loan made for the
16 express purpose of financing the purchase of a distributed generation system or any
17 part thereof.
18 Section 23.13 prohibits a distributed generation system financier from charging
19 a borrower, lessee, host customer or prospective borrower, lessee or host customer
20 certain fees that are attributable to a fee imposed on the financier by a third party in
21 an amount that exceeds the actual amount of the fee charged to the financier by the
22 third party. Section 23.14 sets forth certain requirements for the contents of an
23 agreement for the provision of a distributed generation system loan. Section 23.16
24 requires a distributed generation system financier to provide to a borrower, lessee
25 or host customer a copy of an agreement for the provision of the distributed
26 generation system loan, an agreement for the lease of a distributed generation
27 system or a power purchase agreement immediately after it is signed by the
28 borrower, lessee or host customer.
29 Section 23.17 sets forth certain requirements for a distributed generation
30 system financier with respect to a distributed generation system that will be
31 installed on the roof of a manufactured home.
32 Section 23.18 requires a distributed generation system financier to ensure that
33 any solar installation company that will install a distributed generation system that
34 is leased by the financier or for which a power purchase agreement or agreement
35 for the provision of a distributed generation system loan has been executed by the
36 financier holds the proper contractor’s license and is acting within the monetary
37 limit of that license. If a distributed generation system financier fails to do so, the
38 loan agreement, lease agreement or power purchase agreement is voidable by the
39 borrower, lessee or host customer for a certain period. Additionally, section 23.18
40 prohibits a distributed generation system financier from providing any money
41 pursuant to a loan agreement, lease agreement or power purchase agreement to a
42 solar installation company that does not have the proper contractor’s license or who
43 is acting outside the monetary limit of such a license. Section 23.21 additionally
44 prohibits such a financier from making certain payments to a solar installation
45 company before the distributed generation system has received permission from the
46 appropriate public utility to connect to the power grid or, if the system will not be
47 connected to the power grid, has passed a final inspection and become operational.
48 Section 23.19 requires a distributed generation system financier to make and
49 retain certain recordings with a borrower or lessee. Section 31 of this bill: (1)
50 removes the duty of a solar installation company to make certain recordings
51 concerning a lessee which is imposed in section 23.19 on a distributed generation
52 system financier; and (2) increases, from 4 years to 5 years, the amount of time a
53 solar installation company is required to maintain certain recordings.
54 Section 23.22 prohibits a distributed generation system financier from causing
55 a distributed generation system to be disconnected or otherwise unusable for the
56 failure of a borrower, lessee or host customer to make any payment required under
57 an agreement for the provision of a distributed generation system loan, an
58 agreement for the lease of a distributed generation system or a power purchase
59 agreement unless the borrower, lessee or host customer, as applicable, has failed to
60 make three consecutive monthly payments required under the agreement.

61 Section 23.3 requires a distributed generation system financier to comply with
62 all applicable federal laws and regulations.
63 Section 23.23 provides that the assignee of an agreement for the provision of a
64 distributed generation system loan, an agreement for the lease of a distributed
65 generation system or a power purchase agreement is subject to all claims and
66 defenses of the borrower, lessee or host customer against the distributed generation
67 system financier who provided the loan or entered into the lease or power purchase
68 agreement. Under section 23.23, the liability of the assignee is limited to the
69 amount owed to the assignee at the time the claim or defense is asserted against
70 assignee.
71 Section 23.24 prohibits a distributed generation system financier from
72 advertising any false, misleading or deceptive statement with regard to any rate that
73 may be charged by a public utility for electricity.
74 Under existing law, a lessee or purchaser of a distributed generation system or a
75 host customer has the right to rescind the lease or purchase agreement 3 business
76 days after the agreement is signed. (NRS 598.98216) Sections 23.14, 23.15, 26-30
77 and 32 of this bill provide a borrower, lessee, purchaser or host customer the right
78 to rescind an agreement for the provision of a distributed generation system loan, a
79 lease or purchase agreement or a power purchase agreement: (1) 3 business days
80 after signing, if the person is less than 60 years of age; and (2) 10 business days
81 after signing, if the person is 60 years of age or older. Sections 23.15, 23.2, 26-30
82 and 32 of this bill also provide a borrower, lessee, purchaser or host customer the
83 right to rescind such an agreement if the results of a required on-site physical
84 survey of the premises conducted after the execution of the agreement would
85 require the alteration of the terms of the agreement to increase the price of the
86 distributed generation system or, with certain exceptions, change the type of
87 equipment used for the distributed generation system.
88 Section 23.4 of this bill imposes certain requirements and restrictions upon a
89 person who generates leads or referrals to perform work concerning a distributed
90 generation system. Section 23.6 of this bill prohibits a solar installation company
91 from accepting any payment as an initial down payment or deposit to be paid for
92 the installation of a distributed generation system that exceeds a certain amount.

97 conduct in connection with the lease or purchase of a distributed generation system
98 or the contracting for a power purchase agreement.
99 Section 24 of this bill makes a conforming change so that the definitions
100 applicable to the provisions of existing law governing distributed generation
101 systems apply to sections 23.1-23.8. Section 33 of this bill provides that a violation
102 of sections 23.1-23.8 constitutes a deceptive trade practice and consumer fraud.
103 Sections 23.6, 27, 29 and 30 also provide that a borrower, lessee, purchaser or
104 host customer is not required to pay any money to a distributed generation system
105 financier or solar installation company, except for an initial deposit or down
106 payment that does not exceed a certain amount, before the distributed generation
107 system has received permission from the appropriate public utility to connect to the
108 power grid or, if the system will not be connected to the power grid, has passed a
109 final inspection and become operational.
110 Sections 27 and 29 additionally impose certain duties on a solar installation
111 company if a distributed generation system fails to meet the estimated amount of
112 production in the first year of operation of the system. Sections 23.14, 29 and 30 of
113 this bill require an agreement for the provision of a distributed generation system
114 loan, an agreement for the lease of a distributed generation system or a power
115 purchase agreement to contain information concerning whether a borrower, lessee

118 payoff of any amount owed under the agreement. Sections 27, 29 and 30
119 additionally require certain other provisions and disclosures to be included in an
120 agreement for the purchase or lease of a distributed generation system and a power
121 purchase agreement.
122 Existing law excludes from the definition of “solar installation company” a
123 person who generates leads or referrals to perform work concerning a distributed
124 generation system, if the person’s activities are limited to certain specified
125 activities. (NRS 598.9808) Section 25 of this bill requires such a person to collect
126 only the name, contact information and information concerning the power bill of a
127 prospective purchaser or lessee. Section 25 additionally prohibits such a person
128 from engaging in advertising through any media other than print media.
129 Section 23.7 of this bill authorizes the State Contractors’ Board to adopt
130 regulations that require any employee of a solar installation company to submit to a
131 background check and which set forth requirements for such background checks.
132 Sections 23.14, 26 and 29.5 of this bill require an agreement for the provision
133 of a distributed generation system loan and the cover page for an agreement for the
134 lease of a distributed generation system or power purchase agreement to
135 prominently display at the top of the agreement or cover page the length of the term
136 of the agreement and a description of the consequences if the borrower, lessee or
137 host customer dies during the term of the agreement.
