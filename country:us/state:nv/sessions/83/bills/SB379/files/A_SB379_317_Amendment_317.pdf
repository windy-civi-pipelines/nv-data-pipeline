AN ACT relating to commerce; requiring certain persons to obtain a license as an
installment lender; imposing various requirements upon a distributed
generation system financier who finances the purchase of or leases a
distributed generation system [;] or contracts for a power purchase
agreement; revising requirements for solar installation companies that
sell and install distributed generation systems; imposing certain
requirements and restrictions upon persons who generate leads or
referrals to perform work concerning a distributed generation
system; establishing and revising certain requirements for the contents
of an agreement for the provision of a distributed generation system
loan, an agreement for the purchase or lease of a distributed generation
system and a power purchase agreement; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of installment lenders by the
2 Commissioner of Financial Institutions. (Chapter 675 of NRS) With certain exceptions,
3 existing law prohibits a person from engaging in the business of lending without being
4 licensed by the Commissioner as an installment lender. (NRS 675.060) Section 20 of this bill
5 additionally prohibits a person from engaging in the business of a distributed generation
6 system financier [,] or a manufactured home financier [or a covered lessor] without being
7 licensed by the Commissioner as an installment lender. Section 18 of this bill defines: (1)
8 “distributed generation system financier,” in general, to mean a person who provides a loan to
9 finance the purchase of a distributed generation system, which section 18 designates as a
10 “distributed generation system loan,” [or] leases a distributed generation system [;] or
11 contracts for a power purchase agreement; and (2) “manufactured home financier” to
12 mean, in general, a person who provides a loan to finance the purchase of or leases a

Senate Amendment No. 317 to Senate Bill No. 379 Page 4
13 manufactured home that is not permanently attached to land . [; and (3) “covered lessor” to
14 mean a person who leases personal property to another person pursuant to a lease agreement
15 with an option to purchase.
16 Existing law exempts from the provisions of existing law governing installment lenders
17 persons doing business as a pawnbroker, insurance company, bank or certain other financial
18 institutions. (NRS 675.040) Section 19 of this bill removes that exception if such a person is
19 operating as a distributed generation system financier, manufactured housing financier or
20 covered lessor.]
21 Existing law imposes certain requirements on solar installation companies that sell and
22 install distributed generation systems in this State. Existing law prescribes certain contractual
23 requirements for an agreement for the purchase or lease of a distributed generation system and
24 a power purchase agreement. (NRS 598.9801-598.9822) Sections 2-17 of this bill impose
25 various requirements on distributed generation system financiers and contractual requirements
26 for an agreement for the provision of a distributed generation system loan or lease for a
27 distributed generation system.
28 Section 6 prohibits a distributed generation system financier from charging a borrower,
29 lessee , host customer or prospective borrower , [or] lessee or host customer certain fees that
30 are attributable to a fee imposed on the financier by a third party in an amount that exceeds the
31 actual amount of the fee charged to the financier by the third party. Section 7 sets forth certain
32 requirements for the contents of an agreement for the provision of a distributed generation
33 system loan. Section 10 requires a distributed generation system financier to provide to a
34 borrower or lessee a copy of an agreement for the provision of the distributed generation
35 system loan or lease of a distributed generation system immediately after it is signed by the
36 borrower or lessee.
37 Section 11 sets forth certain requirements for a distributed generation system financier
38 with respect to a distributed generation system that will be installed on the roof of a
39 manufactured home.
40 Section 12 requires a distributed generation system financier to ensure that any solar
41 installation company that will install a distributed generation system that is leased by or for
42 which a distributed generation system loan has been issued by the financier holds the proper
43 contractor’s license and is acting within the monetary limit of that license. If a distributed
44 generation system financier fails to do so, the loan or lease agreement is voidable by the
45 borrower or lessee for a certain period. Additionally, section 12 provides that a distributed
46 generation system financier commits a deceptive trade practice if the financier pays any
47 money pursuant to a loan or lease agreement to a solar installation company that does not have
48 the proper contractor’s license or who is acting outside the monetary limit of such a license.
49 Section 14 additionally prohibits such a financier from making certain payments to a solar
50 installation company before the distributed generation system has received permission from
51 the appropriate public utility to connect to the power grid or, if the system will not be
52 connected to the power grid, has [received] passed a final inspection [.] and become
53 operational.
54 Section 13 requires a distributed generation system financier to make and retain certain
55 recordings with a borrower or lessee. Section 31 of this bill increases, from 4 years to 5 years,
56 the amount of time a solar installation company is required to maintain certain recordings.
57 Section 15 prohibits a distributed generation system financier from causing a distributed
58 generation system to be disconnected or otherwise unusable for failure of a borrower , lessee
59 or host customer to make any payment required under an agreement for the provision of a
60 distributed generation system loan [.] , an agreement for the lease of a distributed
61 generation system or a power purchase agreement unless the borrower, lessee or host
62 customer, as applicable, has failed to make three consecutive monthly payments
63 required under the agreement.
64 Section 17 requires a distributed generation system financier to comply with all
65 applicable federal laws and regulations.
66 Section 16 provides that the assignee of an agreement for the provision of a distributed
67 generation system loan or an agreement for the lease of a distributed generation system is
68 subject to all claims and defenses of the borrower or lessee against the distributed generation
69 system financier who provided the loan or entered into the lease. Under section 16, the
70 liability of the assignee is limited to the amount owed to the assignee at the time the claim or
71 defense is asserted against assignee.

Senate Amendment No. 317 to Senate Bill No. 379 Page 5
72 Section 21 of this bill revises provisions of existing law prohibiting a licensed installment
73 lender from advertising certain false, misleading or deceptive statements or representations to
74 specify that the prohibition also applies to applicable leases and specifically includes such
75 statements made by a distributed generation system financier with regard to any rate that may
76 be charged by a public utility for electricity. (NRS 675.280)
77 Section 22 of this bill revises provisions of existing law relating to retail installment sales
78 so that such provisions continue to apply to distributed generation system financiers [,] and
79 manufactured home financiers [and covered lessors] who engage in certain activities. (NRS
80 97.125)
81 Under existing law, a lessee or purchaser of a distributed generation system has the right
82 to rescind the lease or purchase agreement 3 business days after the agreement is signed.
83 (NRS 598.98216) Sections 7, 9, 26-29 and 32 of this bill provide a borrower, lessee or
84 purchaser the right to rescind an agreement for the provision of a distributed generation
85 system loan or a lease or purchase agreement: (1) three business days after signing, if the
86 person is under 60 years of age; and (2) ten business days after signing, if the person is 60
87 years of age or older. Sections 8, 9, [23] 23.2 and 32 of this bill also provide a borrower,
88 lessee or purchaser the right to rescind such an agreement if the results of a required on-site
89 physical survey of the premises conducted after the execution of the agreement would
90 require the alteration of [any of] the terms of the agreement [.] to increase the price of the
91 distributed generation system or change the type of equipment used for the distributed
92 generation system.
93 Section 23.4 of this bill imposes certain requirements and restrictions upon a person
94 who generates leads or referrals to perform work concerning a distributed generation
95 system. Section 23.6 of this bill prohibits a solar installation company from accepting
96 any payment as an initial down payment or deposit to be paid for the installation of a
97 distributed generation system that exceeds a certain amount. Section 23.8 of this bill
98 prohibits a solar installation company, a person who generates leads or referrals to
99 perform work concerning a distributed generation system or a distributed generation
100 system financier from engaging in certain conduct, including, without limitation, certain
101 specified deceptive or fraudulent conduct in connection with the lease or purchase of a
102 distributed generation system or the contracting for a power purchase agreement.
103 Section 24 of this bill makes a conforming change so that the definitions applicable to the
104 provisions of existing law governing distributed generation systems apply to [section 23.]
105 sections 23.2-23.8. Section 33 of this bill provides that a violation of [section 23] sections
106 23.2-23.8 constitutes a deceptive trade practice and consumer fraud.
107 Sections 7, 27 and 29 also provide that a borrower, lessee or purchaser is not required to
108 pay any money to a distributed generation system financier or solar installation company
109 before the distributed generation system has received permission from the appropriate public
110 utility to connect to the power grid or, if the system will not be connected to the power grid,
111 has [received] passed a final inspection [.] and become operational.
112 Sections 27 and 29 additionally impose certain duties on a solar installation company if a
113 distributed generation system fails to meet the estimated amount of production in the first year
114 of operation of the system. Sections 7, 29 and 30 of this bill require an agreement for the
115 provision of a distributed generation system loan, an agreement for the lease of a distributed
116 generation system or a power purchase agreement to contain [provisions allowing]
117 information concerning whether a borrower, lessee or host customer [to] may transfer the
118 agreement in the event of a sale of the property to which the distributed generation system is
119 affixed [.] and the process to complete a payoff of any amount owed under the
120 agreement. Sections 27, 29 and 30 additionally require certain other provisions and
121 disclosures to be included in an agreement for the purchase or lease of a distributed generation
122 system and a power purchase agreement.
123 Existing law excludes from the definition of “solar installation company” a person who
124 generates leads or referrals to perform work concerning a distributed generation system, if the
125 person’s activities are limited to certain specified activities. (NRS 598.9808) Section 25 of
126 this bill requires such a person to collect only the name, contact information and information
127 concerning the power bill of a prospective purchaser or lessee. Section 25 additionally
128 prohibits such a person from engaging in advertising through any media other than
129 print media.

Senate Amendment No. 317 to Senate Bill No. 379 Page 6
130 Sections 7 and 26 require an agreement for the provision of a distributed generation
131 system loan and the cover page for an agreement for the lease of a distributed generation
132 system to prominently display at the top of the agreement or cover page the length of the term
133 of the loan or lease and a description of the consequences if the borrower or lessee dies during
134 the term of the loan or lease.
135 Sections 26, 28 and 29.5 of this bill require the cover page of an agreement for the
136 lease or purchase of a distributed generation system or a power purchase agreement to
137 contain certain information relating to the amount paid by the company for certain
138 leads and referrals and certain notice relating to the terms of the agreement. Sections 26,
139 28 and 29.5 of this bill also require such a cover page to contain a statement providing
140 certain information concerning financial covenants and restrictions that may affect the
141 future sale or transferability of the property of the purchaser, lessee or host customer.
