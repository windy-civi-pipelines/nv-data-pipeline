AN ACT relating to commerce; requiring certain persons to obtain a
license as an installment lender; imposing various
requirements upon a distributed generation system
financier who finances the purchase of or leases a
distributed generation system; revising requirements for
solar installation companies that sell and install
distributed generation systems; establishing and revising
certain requirements for the contents of an agreement for
the provision of a distributed generation system loan, an
agreement for the purchase or lease of a distributed
generation system and a power purchase agreement; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of installment lenders by
2 the Commissioner of Financial Institutions. (Chapter 675 of NRS) With certain
3 exceptions, existing law prohibits a person from engaging in the business of lending
4 without being licensed by the Commissioner as an installment lender. (NRS
5 675.060) Section 20 of this bill additionally prohibits a person from engaging in the
6 business of a distributed generation system financier, a manufactured home
7 financier or a covered lessor without being licensed by the Commissioner as an
8 installment lender. Section 18 of this bill defines: (1) “distributed generation
-
*SB379*

– 2 –
9 system financier,” in general, to mean a person who provides a loan to finance the
10 purchase of a distributed generation system, which section 18 designates as a
11 “distributed generation system loan,” or leases a distributed generation system; (2)
12 “manufactured home financier” to mean, in general, a person who provides a loan
13 to finance the purchase of or leases a manufactured home that is not permanently
14 attached to land; and (3) “covered lessor” to mean a person who leases personal
15 property to another person pursuant to a lease agreement with an option to
16 purchase.
17 Existing law exempts from the provisions of existing law governing installment
18 lenders persons doing business as a pawnbroker, insurance company, bank or
19 certain other financial institutions. (NRS 675.040) Section 19 of this bill removes
20 that exception if such a person is operating as a distributed generation system
21 financier, manufactured housing financier or covered lessor.
22 Existing law imposes certain requirements on solar installation companies that
23 sell and install distributed generation systems in this State. Existing law prescribes
24 certain contractual requirements for an agreement for the purchase or lease of a
25 distributed generation system and a power purchase agreement. (NRS 598.9801-
26 598.9822) Sections 2-17 of this bill impose various requirements on distributed
27 generation system financiers and contractual requirements for an agreement for the
28 provision of a distributed generation system loan or lease for a distributed
29 generation system.
30 Section 6 prohibits a distributed generation system financier from charging a
31 borrower, lessee or prospective borrower or lessee certain fees that are attributable
32 to a fee imposed on the financier by a third party in an amount that exceeds the
33 actual amount of the fee charged to the financier by the third party. Section 7 sets
34 forth certain requirements for the contents of an agreement for the provision of a
35 distributed generation system loan. Section 10 requires a distributed generation
36 system financier to provide to a borrower or lessee a copy of an agreement for the
37 provision of the distributed generation system loan or lease of a distributed
38 generation system immediately after it is signed by the borrower or lessee.
39 Section 11 sets forth certain requirements for a distributed generation system
40 financier with respect to a distributed generation system that will be installed on the
41 roof of a manufactured home.
42 Section 12 requires a distributed generation system financier to ensure that any
43 solar installation company that will install a distributed generation system that is
44 leased by or for which a distributed generation system loan has been issued by the
45 financier holds the proper contractor’s license and is acting within the monetary
46 limit of that license. If a distributed generation system financier fails to do so, the
47 loan or lease agreement is voidable by the borrower or lessee for a certain period.
48 Additionally, section 12 provides that a distributed generation system financier
49 commits a deceptive trade practice if the financier pays any money pursuant to a
50 loan or lease agreement to a solar installation company that does not have the
51 proper contractor’s license or who is acting outside the monetary limit of such a
52 license. Section 14 additionally prohibits such a financier from making certain
53 payments to a solar installation company before the distributed generation system
54 has received permission from the appropriate public utility to connect to the power
55 grid or, if the system will not be connected to the power grid, has received a final
56 inspection.
57 Section 13 requires a distributed generation system financier to make and retain
58 certain recordings with a borrower or lessee. Section 31 of this bill increases, from
59 4 years to 5 years, the amount of time a solar installation company is required to
60 maintain certain recordings.
61 Section 15 prohibits a distributed generation system financier from causing a
62 distributed generation system to be disconnected or otherwise unusable for failure
-

– 3 –
63 of a borrower to make any payment required under an agreement for the provision
64 of a distributed generation system loan.
65 Section 17 requires a distributed generation system financier to comply with all
66 applicable federal laws and regulations.
67 Section 16 provides that the assignee of an agreement for the provision of a
68 distributed generation system loan or an agreement for the lease of a distributed
69 generation system is subject to all claims and defenses of the borrower or lessee
70 against the distributed generation system financier who provided the loan or entered
71 into the lease. Under section 16, the liability of the assignee is limited to the
72 amount owed to the assignee at the time the claim or defense is asserted against
73 assignee.
74 Section 21 of this bill revises provisions of existing law prohibiting a licensed
75 installment lender from advertising certain false, misleading or deceptive
76 statements or representations to specify that the prohibition also applies to
77 applicable leases and specifically includes such statements made by a distributed
78 generation system financier with regard to any rate that may be charged by a public
79 utility for electricity. (NRS 675.280)
80 Section 22 of this bill revises provisions of existing law relating to retail
81 installment sales so that such provisions continue to apply to distributed generation
82 system financiers, manufactured home financiers and covered lessors who engage
83 in certain activities. (NRS 97.125)
84 Under existing law, a lessee or purchaser of a distributed generation system has
85 the right to rescind the lease or purchase agreement 3 business days after the
86 agreement is signed. (NRS 598.98216) Sections 7, 9, 26-29 and 32 of this bill
87 provide a borrower, lessee or purchaser the right to rescind an agreement for the
88 provision of a distributed generation system loan or a lease or purchase agreement:
89 (1) three business days after signing, if the person is under 60 years of age; and (2)
90 ten business days after signing, if the person is 60 years of age or older. Sections 8,
91 9, 23 and 32 of this bill also provide a borrower, lessee or purchaser the right to
92 rescind such an agreement if the results of a required physical survey of the
93 premises would require the alteration of any of the terms of the agreement. Section
94 24 of this bill makes a conforming change so that the definitions applicable to the
95 provisions of existing law governing distributed generation systems apply to
96 section 23. Section 33 of this bill provides that a violation of section 23 constitutes
97 a deceptive trade practice and consumer fraud.
98 Sections 7, 27 and 29 also provide that a borrower, lessee or purchaser is not
99 required to pay any money to a distributed generation system financier or solar
100 installation company before the distributed generation system has received
101 permission from the appropriate public utility to connect to the power grid or, if the
102 system will not be connected to the power grid, has received a final inspection.
103 Sections 27 and 29 additionally impose certain duties on a solar installation
104 company if a distributed generation system fails to meet the estimated amount of
105 production in the first year of operation of the system. Sections 7, 29 and 30 of this
106 bill require an agreement for the provision of a distributed generation system loan,
107 an agreement for the lease of a distributed generation system or a power purchase
108 agreement to contain provisions allowing a borrower, lessee or host customer to
109 transfer the agreement in the event of a sale of the property to which the distributed
110 generation system is affixed. Sections 27, 29 and 30 additionally require certain
111 other provisions and disclosures to be included in an agreement for the purchase or
112 lease of a distributed generation system and a power purchase agreement.
113 Existing law excludes from the definition of “solar installation company” a
114 person who generates leads or referrals to perform work concerning a distributed
115 generation system, if the person’s activities are limited to certain specified
116 activities. (NRS 598.9808) Section 25 of this bill requires such a person to collect
-
*SB379*

– 4 –
117 only the name, contact information and information concerning the power bill of a
118 prospective purchaser or lessee.
119 Sections 7 and 26 require an agreement for the provision of a distributed
120 generation system loan and the cover page for an agreement for the lease of a
121 distributed generation system to prominently display at the top of the agreement or
122 cover page the length of the term of the loan or lease and a description of the
123 consequences if the borrower or lessee dies during the term of the loan or lease.
