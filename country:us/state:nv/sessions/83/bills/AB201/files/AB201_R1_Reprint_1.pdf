EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to evictions; requiring the automatic sealing of
certain eviction case court files under certain
circumstances; revising the circumstances under which a
court is authorized to seal certain eviction case court files;
requiring the automatic sealing of certain case court files
related to unjustified lockouts under certain
circumstances; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the automatic sealing of certain eviction case court
2 files relating to an action for summary eviction. (NRS 40.2545) Section 1 of this
3 bill expands the circumstances under which an eviction case court file related to an
4 action for summary eviction is sealed automatically by providing for the automatic
5 sealing of any such file: (1) upon motion of the tenant, if the landlord does not file a
6 timely response opposing the motion; or (2) if an appeal taken by a party to the
7 action is resolved in certain ways.
8 Existing law authorizes a court to seal an eviction case court file under certain
9 circumstances, including, without limitation, upon motion by the tenant, if the court
10 finds that sealing the eviction case court file is in the interests of justice and those
11 interests are not outweighed by the public’s interest in knowing about the contents
12 of the eviction case court file. (NRS 40.2545) Section 1 provides that the filing of a
13 motion to seal an eviction case court file more than 1 year after the date on which
14 the eviction order is entered creates a rebuttable presumption that sealing the
15 eviction case court file is in the interests of justice.
16 Existing law authorizes an occupant locked out of a dwelling by the owner or
17 an authorized representative of the owner to recover possession of the dwelling by
18 filing a verified complaint for reentry in justice court. Under existing law, if an
19 occupant files such a complaint, the court is required to hold a trial and, if the court
20 finds that the lockout was unjustified, issue a writ of restitution to restore

21 possession of the dwelling to the occupant. (NRS 40.416) Section 1.5 of this bill
22 provides for the automatic sealing of the case court file relating to a verified
23 complaint for reentry if the court finds that the lockout was unjustified and certain
24 conditions are met.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 40.2545 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 40.2545 1. If a court grants an action for summary eviction
3 pursuant to NRS 40.253 during the COVID-19 emergency, the court
4 shall automatically seal the eviction case court file.
5 2. In addition to the provisions for the automatic sealing of an
6 eviction case court file pursuant to subsection 1, in any action for
7 summary eviction pursuant to NRS 40.253, 40.254 or 40.2542, the
8 eviction case court file is sealed automatically and not open to
9 inspection:
10 (a) Upon the entry of a court order which dismisses the action
11 for summary eviction;
12 (b) Upon motion of the tenant, if the landlord does not file a
13 response opposing the motion within 7 judicial days after the date
14 of service of the motion;
15 (c) Ten judicial days after the entry of a court order which
16 denies the action for summary eviction; [or
17 (c)] (d) Thirty-one days after the tenant has filed an affidavit
18 described in subsection 3 of NRS 40.253 or subsection 3 of NRS
19 40.2542, if the landlord has failed to file an affidavit of complaint
20 pursuant to subsection 5 of NRS 40.253 or subsection 5 of NRS
21 40.2542 within 30 days after the tenant filed the affidavit [.] ; or
22 (e) If an appeal is taken, upon a district court with jurisdiction
23 over the matter rendering a decision that:
24 (1) Upholds an order which dismisses an action for
25 summary eviction;
26 (2) Upholds an order which denies an action for summary
27 eviction; or
28 (3) Remands the case to the court from which the appeal
29 was taken for the entry of an order which:
30 (I) Dismisses an action for summary eviction; or
31 (II) Denies an action for summary eviction.
32 3. In addition to the provisions for the automatic sealing of an
33 eviction case court file pursuant to subsections 1 and 2, the court
34 may order the sealing of an eviction case court file for an action for
35 summary eviction pursuant to NRS 40.253, 40.254 or 40.2542:
-
*AB201_R1*

– 3 –
1 (a) Upon the filing of a written stipulation by the landlord and
2 the tenant to set aside the order of eviction and seal the eviction case
3 court file; or
4 (b) Upon motion of the tenant and decision by the court if the
5 court finds that:
6 (1) The eviction should be set aside pursuant to Rule 60 of
7 the Justice Court Rules of Civil Procedure; or
8 (2) Sealing the eviction case court file is in the interests of
9 justice and those interests are not outweighed by the public’s
10 interest in knowing about the contents of the eviction case court file,
11 after considering, without limitation, the following factors:
12 (I) Circumstances beyond the control of the tenant that
13 led to the eviction;
14 (II) Other extenuating circumstances under which the
15 order of eviction was granted; and
16 (III) The amount of time that has elapsed between the
17 granting of the order of eviction and the filing of the motion to seal
18 the eviction case court file. For the purposes of this subparagraph,
19 if the filing of the motion to seal the eviction case court file occurs
20 more than 1 year after the date on which the eviction order is
21 entered, there is a presumption that sealing the eviction case court
22 file is in the interests of justice and those interests are not
23 outweighed by the public’s interest in knowing about the contents
24 of the eviction case court file unless the presumption is rebutted by
25 clear and convincing evidence to the contrary.
26 4. If the court orders the eviction case court file sealed pursuant
27 to this section, all proceedings recounted in the eviction case court
28 file shall be deemed never to have occurred.
29 5. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, a notice to
30 surrender must not be made available for public inspection by any
31 person or governmental entity, including, without limitation, by a
32 sheriff or constable. This subsection does not:
33 (a) Apply to a notice to surrender which has been filed with a
34 court and which is part of an eviction case court file that has not
35 been sealed pursuant to this section.
36 (b) Prohibit the service of a notice to surrender pursuant to NRS
37 40.280, and such service of a notice to surrender shall be deemed
38 not to constitute making the notice to surrender available for public
39 inspection as described in this subsection.
40 6. Any order issued by the court pursuant to this section must
41 include the basis for the decision of the court.
42 7. As used in this section:
43 (a) “COVID-19 emergency” means the period of time:
44 (1) Beginning on March 12, 2020, the date on which the
45 Governor issued the Declaration of Emergency for COVID-19; and
-

– 4 –
1 (2) Ending on the date on which the Governor terminates the
2 emergency described in the Declaration [May 20, 2022].
3 (b) “Eviction case court file” means all records relating to an
4 action for summary eviction which are maintained by the court,
5 including, without limitation, records maintained by a justice court
6 or district court, the affidavit of complaint and any other pleadings,
7 proof of service, findings of the court, any order made on motion as
8 provided in Nevada Rules of Civil Procedure, Justice Court Rules of
9 Civil Procedure , District Court Rules and local rules of practice
10 and all other papers, records, proceedings and evidence, including
11 exhibits and transcript of the testimony.
12 Sec. 1.5. NRS 40.416 is hereby amended to read as follows:
13 40.416 1. If the owner of a dwelling or an authorized
14 representative of the owner locks an occupant out of the dwelling
15 pursuant to NRS 40.412, the occupant may recover possession of
16 the dwelling as provided in this section.
17 2. The occupant must file with the justice court of the township
18 in which the dwelling is located a verified complaint for reentry,
19 specifying:
20 (a) The facts of the lockout by the owner of the dwelling or the
21 authorized representative of the owner; and
22 (b) The legal basis upon which reentry into the dwelling is
23 warranted.
24 3. The court shall, after notice to both parties, hold a trial on
25 the occupant’s verified complaint for reentry not later than 10
26 judicial days after the date on which the occupant files the verified
27 complaint for reentry.
28 4. If the court finds that an unjustified lockout has occurred,
29 the court [must issue] shall:
30 (a) Issue a writ of restitution, restoring possession of the
31 dwelling to the occupant [.] ; and
32 (b) Automatically seal the case court file:
33 (1) Upon the expiration of the period for filing a notice of
34 appeal, if no notice of appeal has been filed within that period; or
35 (2) If a notice of appeal is timely filed, upon final
36 resolution of the appeal, if the finding that an unjustified lockout
37 occurred is affirmed.
38 5. A party may appeal from the court’s judgment at the trial on
39 the verified complaint for reentry in the same manner as a party may
40 appeal a judgment in an action for forcible detainer.
41 6. If the owner of the dwelling or the person on whom a writ of
42 restitution is served fails to immediately comply with the writ or
43 later disobeys the writ, the failure is grounds for contempt of court
44 against the owner or the person on whom the writ was served, under
45 chapter 22 of NRS.
