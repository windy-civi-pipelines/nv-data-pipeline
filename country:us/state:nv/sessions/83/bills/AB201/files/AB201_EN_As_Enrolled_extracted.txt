Section 1:
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to evictions; requiring the automatic sealing of
certain eviction case court files under certain circumstances;
revising the circumstances under which a court is authorized
to seal certain eviction case court files; requiring the
automatic sealing of certain case court files related to
unjustified lockouts under certain circumstances; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law provides for the automatic sealing of certain eviction case court
files relating to an action for summary eviction. (NRS 40.2545) Section 1 of this
bill expands the circumstances under which an eviction case court file related to an
action for summary eviction is sealed automatically by providing for the automatic
sealing of any such file: (1) upon motion of the tenant, if the landlord does not file a
timely response opposing the motion; or (2) if an appeal taken by a party to the
action is resolved in certain ways.
Existing law authorizes a court to seal an eviction case court file under certain
circumstances, including, without limitation, upon motion by the tenant, if the court
finds that sealing the eviction case court file is in the interests of justice and those
interests are not outweighed by the public’s interest in knowing about the contents
of the eviction case court file. (NRS 40.2545) Section 1 provides that the filing of a
motion to seal an eviction case court file more than 1 year after the date on which
the eviction order is entered creates a rebuttable presumption that sealing the
eviction case court file is in the interests of justice.
Existing law authorizes an occupant locked out of a dwelling by the owner or
an authorized representative of the owner to recover possession of the dwelling by
filing a verified complaint for reentry in justice court. Under existing law, if an
occupant files such a complaint, the court is required to hold a trial and, if the court
finds that the lockout was unjustified, issue a writ of restitution to restore
possession of the dwelling to the occupant. (NRS 40.416) Section 1.5 of this bill
provides for the automatic sealing of the case court file relating to a verified
complaint for reentry if the court finds that the lockout was unjustified and certain
conditions are met.

(c)] (d) Thirty-one days after the tenant has filed an affidavit
described in subsection 3 of NRS 40.253 or subsection 3 of NRS

Section 5:
40.2542, if the landlord has failed to file an affidavit of complaint
pursuant to subsection 5 of NRS 40.253 or subsection 5 of NRS

court finds that:
(1) The eviction should be set aside pursuant to Rule 60 of
the Justice Court Rules of Civil Procedure; or
(2) Sealing the eviction case court file is in the interests of
justice and those interests are not outweighed by the public’s
interest in knowing about the contents of the eviction case court file,
after considering, without limitation, the following factors:

led to the eviction;

entered, there is a presumption that sealing the eviction case court
file is in the interests of justice and those interests are not

of the eviction case court file unless the presumption is rebutted by
clear and convincing evidence to the contrary.
