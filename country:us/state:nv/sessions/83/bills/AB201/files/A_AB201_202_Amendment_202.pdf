EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to evictions; requiring the automatic sealing of certain eviction
case court files under certain circumstances; revising the circumstances
under which a court is authorized to seal certain eviction case court
files; requiring the automatic sealing of certain case court files
related to unjustified lockouts under certain circumstances; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the automatic sealing of certain eviction case court files relating
2 to an action for summary eviction. (NRS 40.2545) Section 1 of this bill expands the
3 circumstances under which an eviction case court file related to an action for summary
4 eviction is sealed automatically by providing for the automatic sealing of any such file: (1)
5 upon motion of the tenant, if [the court finds that] the landlord does not [oppose] file a timely
6 response opposing the motion; or (2) if an appeal taken by a party to the action is resolved in
7 certain ways.
8 Existing law authorizes a court to seal an eviction case court file under certain
9 circumstances, including, without limitation, upon motion by the tenant, if the court finds that
10 sealing the eviction case court file is in the interests of justice and those interests are not
11 outweighed by the public’s interest in knowing about the contents of the eviction case court
12 file. (NRS 40.2545) Section 1 provides that the filing of a motion to seal an eviction case
13 court file more than 1 year after the date on which the eviction order is entered creates a
14 rebuttable presumption that sealing the eviction case court file is in the interests of justice.
15 Existing law authorizes an occupant locked out of a dwelling by the owner or an
16 authorized representative of the owner to recover possession of the dwelling by filing a
17 verified complaint for reentry in justice court. Under existing law, if an occupant files
18 such a complaint, the court is required to hold a trial and, if the court finds that the
19 lockout was unjustified, issue a writ of restitution to restore possession of the dwelling to
20 the occupant. (NRS 40.416) Section 1.5 of this bill provides for the automatic sealing of
21 the case court file relating to a verified complaint for reentry if the court finds that the
22 lockout was unjustified and certain conditions are met.

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 40.2545 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 40.2545 1. If a court grants an action for summary eviction pursuant to NRS
3 40.253 during the COVID-19 emergency, the court shall automatically seal the
4 eviction case court file.
5 2. In addition to the provisions for the automatic sealing of an eviction case
6 court file pursuant to subsection 1, in any action for summary eviction pursuant to
7 NRS 40.253, 40.254 or 40.2542, the eviction case court file is sealed automatically
8 and not open to inspection:
9 (a) Upon the entry of a court order which dismisses the action for summary
10 eviction;
11 (b) Upon motion of the tenant , [and decision by the court] if [the court finds
12 that] the landlord does not [oppose] file a response opposing the motion [;] within
13 7 judicial days after the date of service of the motion;
14 (c) Ten judicial days after the entry of a court order which denies the action for
15 summary eviction; [or
16 (c)] (d) Thirty-one days after the tenant has filed an affidavit described in
17 subsection 3 of NRS 40.253 or subsection 3 of NRS 40.2542, if the landlord has
18 failed to file an affidavit of complaint pursuant to subsection 5 of NRS 40.253 or
19 subsection 5 of NRS 40.2542 within 30 days after the tenant filed the affidavit [.] ;
20 or
21 (e) If an appeal is taken, upon a district court [, the Court of Appeals or the
22 Supreme Court of Nevada, whichever has] with jurisdiction over the matter [,]
23 rendering a decision that:
24 (1) Upholds an order which dismisses an action for summary eviction;
25 (2) Upholds an order which denies an action for summary eviction; or
26 (3) Remands the case to the court from which the appeal was taken for
27 the entry of an order which:
28 (I) Dismisses an action for summary eviction; or
29 (II) Denies an action for summary eviction.
30 3. In addition to the provisions for the automatic sealing of an eviction case
31 court file pursuant to subsections 1 and 2, the court may order the sealing of an
32 eviction case court file for an action for summary eviction pursuant to NRS 40.253,
33 40.254 or 40.2542:
34 (a) Upon the filing of a written stipulation by the landlord and the tenant to set
35 aside the order of eviction and seal the eviction case court file; or
36 (b) Upon motion of the tenant and decision by the court if the court finds that:
37 (1) The eviction should be set aside pursuant to Rule 60 of the Justice
38 Court Rules of Civil Procedure; or
39 (2) Sealing the eviction case court file is in the interests of justice and those
40 interests are not outweighed by the public’s interest in knowing about the contents
41 of the eviction case court file, after considering, without limitation, the following
42 factors:
43 (I) Circumstances beyond the control of the tenant that led to the
44 eviction;
45 (II) Other extenuating circumstances under which the order of eviction
46 was granted; and
47 (III) The amount of time that has elapsed between the granting of the
48 order of eviction and the filing of the motion to seal the eviction case court file. For
49 the purposes of this subparagraph, if the filing of the motion to seal the eviction

Assembly Amendment No. 202 to Assembly Bill No. 201 Page 5
1 case court file occurs more than 1 year after the date on which the eviction order
2 is entered, there is a presumption that sealing the eviction case court file is in the
3 interests of justice and those interests are not outweighed by the public’s interest
4 in knowing about the contents of the eviction case court file unless the
5 presumption is rebutted by clear and convincing evidence to the contrary.
6 4. If the court orders the eviction case court file sealed pursuant to this
7 section, all proceedings recounted in the eviction case court file shall be deemed
8 never to have occurred.
9 5. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, a notice to surrender must
10 not be made available for public inspection by any person or governmental entity,
11 including, without limitation, by a sheriff or constable. This subsection does not:
12 (a) Apply to a notice to surrender which has been filed with a court and which
13 is part of an eviction case court file that has not been sealed pursuant to this section.
14 (b) Prohibit the service of a notice to surrender pursuant to NRS 40.280, and
15 such service of a notice to surrender shall be deemed not to constitute making the
16 notice to surrender available for public inspection as described in this subsection.
17 6. Any order issued by the court pursuant to this section must include the
18 basis for the decision of the court.
19 7. As used in this section:
20 (a) “COVID-19 emergency” means the period of time:
21 (1) Beginning on March 12, 2020, the date on which the Governor issued

23 (2) Ending on the date on which the Governor terminates the emergency
24 described in the Declaration [May 20, 2022].
25 (b) “Eviction case court file” means all records relating to an action for
26 summary eviction which are maintained by the court, including, without limitation,
27 records maintained by a justice court or district court, the affidavit of complaint
28 and any other pleadings, proof of service, findings of the court, any order made on
29 motion as provided in Nevada Rules of Civil Procedure, Justice Court Rules of
30 Civil Procedure , District Court Rules and local rules of practice and all other
31 papers, records, proceedings and evidence, including exhibits and transcript of the
32 testimony.
33 Sec. 1.5. NRS 40.416 is hereby amended to read as follows:
34 40.416 1. If the owner of a dwelling or an authorized representative of the
35 owner locks an occupant out of the dwelling pursuant to NRS 40.412, the occupant
36 may recover possession of the dwelling as provided in this section.
37 2. The occupant must file with the justice court of the township in which the
38 dwelling is located a verified complaint for reentry, specifying:
39 (a) The facts of the lockout by the owner of the dwelling or the authorized
40 representative of the owner; and
41 (b) The legal basis upon which reentry into the dwelling is warranted.
42 3. The court shall, after notice to both parties, hold a trial on the occupant’s
43 verified complaint for reentry not later than 10 judicial days after the date on which
44 the occupant files the verified complaint for reentry.
45 4. If the court finds that an unjustified lockout has occurred, the court [must
46 issue] shall:
47 (a) Issue a writ of restitution, restoring possession of the dwelling to the
48 occupant [.] ; and
49 (b) Automatically seal the case court file:
50 (1) Upon the expiration of the period for filing a notice of appeal, if no

52 (2) If a notice of appeal is timely filed, upon final resolution of the
53 appeal, if the finding that an unjustified lockout occurred is affirmed.

Assembly Amendment No. 202 to Assembly Bill No. 201 Page 6
1 5. A party may appeal from the court’s judgment at the trial on the verified
2 complaint for reentry in the same manner as a party may appeal a judgment in an
3 action for forcible detainer.
4 6. If the owner of the dwelling or the person on whom a writ of restitution is
5 served fails to immediately comply with the writ or later disobeys the writ, the
6 failure is grounds for contempt of court against the owner or the person on whom
7 the writ was served, under chapter 22 of NRS.
8 7. This section does not affect:
9 (a) The right of any party to pursue a separate cause of action under this

11 relationship exists between the parties; or
12 (b) The rights of an owner or occupant in a forcible detainer, unlawful detainer
13 or forcible entry and detainer action.
14 Sec. 2. The amendatory provisions [of section 1] of this act apply to [any
15 action for summary eviction] actions filed before, on or after July 1, 2025.
