EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; enacting the School Psychologist
Interstate Licensure Compact; exempting a person
licensed pursuant to the Compact from certain
requirements generally applicable to licensure;
authorizing the sharing of certain information when
required pursuant to the Compact; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Commission on Professional Standards in Education
2 to prescribe regulations for licensing educational personnel, including regulations
3 which provide for the reciprocal licensure of educational personnel from other
4 states. (NRS 391.019, 319.032) Existing law defines the term “school psychologist”
5 to mean a person who holds a license issued pursuant to the provisions of existing
6 law governing the licensing of educational personnel and an endorsement to serve
7 as a school psychologist issued pursuant to the regulations adopted by the
8 Commission or who is otherwise authorized by the Superintendent of Public
9 Instruction to serve as a school psychologist. (NRS 385.007)
10 Section 2 of this bill enacts the School Psychologist Interstate Licensure
11 Compact. The Compact allows a person who has been issued a license as a school
12 psychologist in his or her home state that is a member of the Compact, which the
13 Compact designates as a “home state license,” to obtain an equivalent license in
14 any other state that is a member of the Compact. Sections 3 and 5 of this bill
15 require the Commission on Professional Standards in Education to adopt
16 regulations: (1) to carry out the provisions of the Compact; and (2) which provide
17 for the licensure of persons pursuant to the Compact.

18 The Compact provides for the creation by member states of a joint
19 governmental agency called the School Psychologist Interstate Licensure Compact
20 Commission. Under the Compact, the Commission has the power to establish and
21 amend rules and bylaws and various other powers relating to the administration of
22 the Compact. The Compact establishes procedures and requirements for the
23 conduct of meetings of the Commission and for the promulgation of rules by the
24 Commission.
25 The Compact sets forth certain requirements for a state to be eligible to join the
26 Compact, including qualifications that a state must impose for the issuance of a
27 home state license. Existing regulations of the Commission on Professional
28 Standards in Education, with certain exceptions, set forth three alternative avenues
29 for a person to qualify for an endorsement to serve as a school psychologist in this
30 State. Under the first avenue, a person must: (1) hold a master’s or more advanced
31 degree; (2) have preparation in school psychology; (3) have successfully completed
32 certain areas of study; (4) have earned 60 semester hours of graduate credits in
33 certain areas of study; and (5) have completed an internship in school psychology
34 consisting of two full-time regular consecutive semesters or 1,000 hours of
35 supervised and practical experience which meet certain criteria. Under the second
36 avenue, a person must hold a credential as a Nationally Certified School
37 Psychologist issued by the National Association of School Psychologists or its
38 successor organization. Finally, under the third avenue, a person must have
39 completed a program approved by the State Board of Education which prepares a
40 person to be a school psychologist. (NAC 391.315, as amended by LCB File No.
41 R120-22 and R165-22, NAC 391.319, as amended by LCB File No. 124-22) The
42 Compact requires that, to be eligible to join the Compact, a state must require an
43 applicant for a home state license as a school psychologist to have: (1) taken and
44 passed a qualifying national examination, as defined by the rules of the School
45 Psychologist Interstate Licensure Compact Commission; (2) completed a minimum
46 of 1,200 hours of supervised internship, of which at least 600 must have been
47 completed in a school, before being approved for licensure; and (3) graduated from
48 a qualifying school psychologist education program approved by the rules of the
49 Commission.
50 The Compact sets forth procedures by which a person who has been issued a
51 home state license as a school psychologist may obtain an equivalent license in
52 another state that is a member of the Compact. In order to obtain and maintain such
53 an equivalent license, the Compact requires the person to: (1) hold and maintain a
54 home state license; (2) satisfy any applicable state-specific requirements established
55 by the member state after an equivalent license is granted; (3) complete certain
56 administrative or application requirements and pay certain fees; (4) complete any
57 requirements for renewal in his or her home state; and (5) undergo a criminal
58 background check. To renew an equivalent license issued pursuant to the Compact,
59 the Compact requires a person only to apply for renewal, complete a background
60 check and pay any applicable fees for renewal.
61 Sections 4, 6 and 8 of this bill exempt a person licensed pursuant to the
62 Compact from: (1) requirements concerning the examinations required for the
63 initial licensing of teachers and other educational personnel; (2) requirements for
64 continuing education for school psychologists; and (3) a requirement for an
65 applicant for a license as a teacher or administrator or to perform some other
66 educational function to submit with his or her application for licensure proof of
67 completion of a certain course of study and training approved by the Commission
68 on Professional Standards in Education. (NRS 391.021, 391.0349, 391.037)
69 Section 1 of this bill revises the definition of the term “school psychologist” to
70 include a person licensed pursuant to the Compact among the persons who
71 constitute a school psychologist.
-

72 The Compact also requires a member state to agree to provide for the
73 facilitation of certain information concerning persons licensed as school
74 psychologists. Section 7 of this bill revises provisions governing the confidentiality
75 of certain information concerning an application for licensure to authorize such
76 information to be disclosed when required by the Compact. Section 9 of this bill
77 provides for the confidentiality of certain information disclosed pursuant to the
78 Compact.
79 The Compact provides additional provisions to carry out the Compact,
80 including provisions relating to active military members or their spouses,
81 provisions for oversight, dispute resolution and enforcement by the School
82 Psychologist Interstate Licensure Compact Commission and procedures for
83 amendments of and withdrawals from the Compact. The Compact becomes
84 effective upon ratification from seven states. Currently, only Colorado and West
85 Virginia have ratified the Compact.

15 Rules adopted thereunder. Rules and amendments shall become
16 binding as of the date specified in each Rule or amendment.
17 B. The Commission shall promulgate reasonable Rules to
18 achieve the intent and purpose of this interstate Compact. In the
19 event the Commission exercises its Rulemaking authority in a
20 manner that is beyond the purpose and intent of this interstate
21 Compact, or the powers granted hereunder, then such an action by
22 the Commission shall be invalid and have no force and effect of
23 law in the Member States.
24 C. If a majority of the legislatures of the Member States
25 rejects a Rule, by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same

26 any action against a licensee for professional malpractice,

28 3. The Commission shall be entitled to receive service of
29 process in any proceeding regarding the enforcement or
30 interpretation of the Compact and shall have standing to intervene
31 in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide the
32 Commission service of process shall render a judgment or order
33 void as to the Commission, this Compact, or promulgated Rules.
34 B. Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination
35 1. If the Commission determines that a Member State has
36 defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities

2 State may be terminated from the Compact upon an affirmative
3 vote of a supermajority of the delegates of the Member States, and
4 all rights, privileges and benefits conferred on that state by this
5 Compact may be terminated on the effective date of termination. A
6 cure of the default does not relieve the offending State of
7 obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.
8 D. Termination of membership in the Compact shall be
9 imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have
10 been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be
11 given by the Commission to the governor, the majority and
12 minority leaders of the defaulting State’s legislature, the
13 defaulting State’s Licensing Authority and each of the Member
14 States’ Licensing Authorities.

20 Compact, that State shall immediately provide notice to all

30 Commission by petitioning the U.S. District Court for the District

45 United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the
-
*SB227*
– 20 –
1 federal district where the Commission has its principal offices to
2 enforce compliance with the provisions of the Compact and its
3 promulgated Rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive
4 relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary,
5 the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation,

9 defaulting Member State’s law.
10 2. A Member State may initiate legal action against the
11 Commission in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia

33 be materially different from the Model Compact statute shall be
34 entitled to the default process set forth in Section 10.
35 b. If any Member State is later found to be in default, or

37 shall remain in existence and the Compact shall remain in effect
38 even if the number of Member States should be less than seven.
39 2. Member States enacting the Compact subsequent to the
40 Charter Member States shall be subject to the process set forth in

44 3. All actions taken for the benefit of the Commission or in
45 furtherance of the purposes of the administration of the Compact
-
*SB227*
– 21 –

3 Commission unless specifically repudiated by the Commission.
4 a. Any State that joins the Compact subsequent to the
5 Commission’s initial adoption of the Rules and bylaws shall be

22 subsequent statutory enactment to the contrary, such withdrawing
23 State shall continue to recognize all licenses granted pursuant to
24 this Compact for a minimum of six (6) months after the date of
25 such notice of withdrawal.
26 1. Nothing contained in this Compact shall be construed to

36
37 A. This Compact and the Commission’s rulemaking authority
38 shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes, and
39 the implementation and administration of the Compact. Provisions

42 Commission’s rulemaking authority solely for those purposes.
43 B. The provisions of this Compact shall be severable and if
44 any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this Compact is held
45 by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the
-
*SB227*
– 22 –
1 constitution of any Member State, a State seeking participation in
2 the Compact, or of the United States, or the applicability thereof to
3 any government, agency, person or circumstance is held to be

7 be affected thereby.
8 C. Notwithstanding subsection B of this Section, the
9 Commission may deny a State’s participation in the Compact or,
10 in accordance with the requirements of Section 10.B, terminate a
11 Member State’s participation in the Compact, if it determines that
12 a constitutional requirement of a Member State is a material
13 departure from the Compact. Otherwise, if this Compact shall be
14 held to be contrary to the constitution of any Member State, the
15 Compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining
16 Member States and in full force and effect as to the Member State
17 affected as to all severable matters.
18
19 SECTION 13. CONSISTENT EFFECT AND

4 may be prepared from those public books and public records. Any
5 such copies, abstracts or memoranda may be used to supply the
6 general public with copies, abstracts or memoranda of the records or
7 may be used in any other way to the advantage of the governmental
8 entity or of the general public. This section does not supersede or in
9 any manner affect the federal laws governing copyrights or enlarge,
10 diminish or affect in any other manner the rights of a person in any
11 written book or record which is copyrighted pursuant to federal law.
12 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record
13 which is copyrighted solely because it is copyrighted.
14 3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a
15 public book or record shall not deny a request made pursuant to
16 subsection 1 to inspect or copy or receive a copy of a public book or
17 record on the basis that the requested public book or record contains
18 information that is confidential if the governmental entity can

29 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
30 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
31 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by
32 means of an electronic medium would:
33 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
34 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential
35 and that cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from
36 information that is not otherwise confidential.
37 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who
38 has legal custody or control of a public record:
39 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the

Raw Text:
REQUIRES TWO-THIRDS MAJORITY VOTE (§ 2)
S.B. 227
SENATE BILL NO. 227–COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION
(ON BEHALF OF THE JOINT INTERIM STANDING
COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION)
FEBRUARY 20, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Education
SUMMARY—Enacts the School Psychologist Interstate Licensure
Compact. (BDR 34-531)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; enacting the School Psychologist
Interstate Licensure Compact; exempting a person
licensed pursuant to the Compact from certain
requirements generally applicable to licensure;
authorizing the sharing of certain information when
required pursuant to the Compact; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Commission on Professional Standards in Education
2 to prescribe regulations for licensing educational personnel, including regulations
3 which provide for the reciprocal licensure of educational personnel from other
4 states. (NRS 391.019, 319.032) Existing law defines the term “school psychologist”
5 to mean a person who holds a license issued pursuant to the provisions of existing
6 law governing the licensing of educational personnel and an endorsement to serve
7 as a school psychologist issued pursuant to the regulations adopted by the
8 Commission or who is otherwise authorized by the Superintendent of Public
9 Instruction to serve as a school psychologist. (NRS 385.007)
10 Section 2 of this bill enacts the School Psychologist Interstate Licensure
11 Compact. The Compact allows a person who has been issued a license as a school
12 psychologist in his or her home state that is a member of the Compact, which the
13 Compact designates as a “home state license,” to obtain an equivalent license in
14 any other state that is a member of the Compact. Sections 3 and 5 of this bill
15 require the Commission on Professional Standards in Education to adopt
16 regulations: (1) to carry out the provisions of the Compact; and (2) which provide
17 for the licensure of persons pursuant to the Compact.

*SB227*

– 2 –
18 The Compact provides for the creation by member states of a joint
19 governmental agency called the School Psychologist Interstate Licensure Compact
20 Commission. Under the Compact, the Commission has the power to establish and
21 amend rules and bylaws and various other powers relating to the administration of
22 the Compact. The Compact establishes procedures and requirements for the
23 conduct of meetings of the Commission and for the promulgation of rules by the
24 Commission.
25 The Compact sets forth certain requirements for a state to be eligible to join the
26 Compact, including qualifications that a state must impose for the issuance of a
27 home state license. Existing regulations of the Commission on Professional
28 Standards in Education, with certain exceptions, set forth three alternative avenues
29 for a person to qualify for an endorsement to serve as a school psychologist in this
30 State. Under the first avenue, a person must: (1) hold a master’s or more advanced
31 degree; (2) have preparation in school psychology; (3) have successfully completed
32 certain areas of study; (4) have earned 60 semester hours of graduate credits in
33 certain areas of study; and (5) have completed an internship in school psychology
34 consisting of two full-time regular consecutive semesters or 1,000 hours of
35 supervised and practical experience which meet certain criteria. Under the second
36 avenue, a person must hold a credential as a Nationally Certified School
37 Psychologist issued by the National Association of School Psychologists or its
38 successor organization. Finally, under the third avenue, a person must have
39 completed a program approved by the State Board of Education which prepares a
40 person to be a school psychologist. (NAC 391.315, as amended by LCB File No.
41 R120-22 and R165-22, NAC 391.319, as amended by LCB File No. 124-22) The
42 Compact requires that, to be eligible to join the Compact, a state must require an
43 applicant for a home state license as a school psychologist to have: (1) taken and
44 passed a qualifying national examination, as defined by the rules of the School
45 Psychologist Interstate Licensure Compact Commission; (2) completed a minimum

47 completed in a school, before being approved for licensure; and (3) graduated from
48 a qualifying school psychologist education program approved by the rules of the
49 Commission.
50 The Compact sets forth procedures by which a person who has been issued a
51 home state license as a school psychologist may obtain an equivalent license in
52 another state that is a member of the Compact. In order to obtain and maintain such
53 an equivalent license, the Compact requires the person to: (1) hold and maintain a
54 home state license; (2) satisfy any applicable state-specific requirements established
55 by the member state after an equivalent license is granted; (3) complete certain
56 administrative or application requirements and pay certain fees; (4) complete any
57 requirements for renewal in his or her home state; and (5) undergo a criminal
58 background check. To renew an equivalent license issued pursuant to the Compact,
59 the Compact requires a person only to apply for renewal, complete a background
60 check and pay any applicable fees for renewal.
61 Sections 4, 6 and 8 of this bill exempt a person licensed pursuant to the
62 Compact from: (1) requirements concerning the examinations required for the
63 initial licensing of teachers and other educational personnel; (2) requirements for
64 continuing education for school psychologists; and (3) a requirement for an
65 applicant for a license as a teacher or administrator or to perform some other
66 educational function to submit with his or her application for licensure proof of
67 completion of a certain course of study and training approved by the Commission
68 on Professional Standards in Education. (NRS 391.021, 391.0349, 391.037)
69 Section 1 of this bill revises the definition of the term “school psychologist” to
70 include a person licensed pursuant to the Compact among the persons who
71 constitute a school psychologist.

72 The Compact also requires a member state to agree to provide for the
73 facilitation of certain information concerning persons licensed as school
74 psychologists. Section 7 of this bill revises provisions governing the confidentiality
75 of certain information concerning an application for licensure to authorize such
76 information to be disclosed when required by the Compact. Section 9 of this bill
77 provides for the confidentiality of certain information disclosed pursuant to the
78 Compact.
79 The Compact provides additional provisions to carry out the Compact,
80 including provisions relating to active military members or their spouses,
81 provisions for oversight, dispute resolution and enforcement by the School
82 Psychologist Interstate Licensure Compact Commission and procedures for
83 amendments of and withdrawals from the Compact. The Compact becomes

15 Rules adopted thereunder. Rules and amendments shall become
16 binding as of the date specified in each Rule or amendment.
17 B. The Commission shall promulgate reasonable Rules to
18 achieve the intent and purpose of this interstate Compact. In the
19 event the Commission exercises its Rulemaking authority in a
20 manner that is beyond the purpose and intent of this interstate
21 Compact, or the powers granted hereunder, then such an action by
22 the Commission shall be invalid and have no force and effect of
23 law in the Member States.

28 3. The Commission shall be entitled to receive service of
29 process in any proceeding regarding the enforcement or
30 interpretation of the Compact and shall have standing to intervene
31 in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide the
32 Commission service of process shall render a judgment or order
33 void as to the Commission, this Compact, or promulgated Rules.
34 B. Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination
35 1. If the Commission determines that a Member State has
36 defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities

44 default to the other Member States.

2 State may be terminated from the Compact upon an affirmative
3 vote of a supermajority of the delegates of the Member States, and
4 all rights, privileges and benefits conferred on that state by this
5 Compact may be terminated on the effective date of termination. A
6 cure of the default does not relieve the offending State of
7 obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.
8 D. Termination of membership in the Compact shall be
9 imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have
10 been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be
11 given by the Commission to the governor, the majority and
12 minority leaders of the defaulting State’s legislature, the
13 defaulting State’s Licensing Authority and each of the Member
14 States’ Licensing Authorities.

16 assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the
17 effective date of termination, including obligations that extend
18 beyond the effective date of termination.
19 F. Upon the termination of a State’s membership from this
20 Compact, that State shall immediately provide notice to all
21 Licensees within that State of such termination. The terminated
22 State shall continue to recognize all Licenses granted pursuant to
23 this Compact for a minimum of six (6) months after the date of
24 said notice of termination.

30 Commission by petitioning the U.S. District Court for the District

33 such litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees.
34 I. Dispute Resolution

40 both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as

45 United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the
-
*SB227*

– 20 –
1 federal district where the Commission has its principal offices to
2 enforce compliance with the provisions of the Compact and its
3 promulgated Rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive
4 relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary,
5 the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation,

7 not be the exclusive remedies of the Commission. The Commission
8 may pursue any other remedies available under federal law or the
9 defaulting Member State’s law.
10 2. A Member State may initiate legal action against the
11 Commission in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia
12 or the federal district where the Commission has its principal

44 3. All actions taken for the benefit of the Commission or in
45 furtherance of the purposes of the administration of the Compact
-

22 subsequent statutory enactment to the contrary, such withdrawing
23 State shall continue to recognize all licenses granted pursuant to
24 this Compact for a minimum of six (6) months after the date of
25 such notice of withdrawal.
26 1. Nothing contained in this Compact shall be construed to

38 shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes, and
39 the implementation and administration of the Compact. Provisions

42 Commission’s rulemaking authority solely for those purposes.
43 B. The provisions of this Compact shall be severable and if
44 any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this Compact is held
45 by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the
-
*SB227*

– 22 –
1 constitution of any Member State, a State seeking participation in
2 the Compact, or of the United States, or the applicability thereof to
3 any government, agency, person or circumstance is held to be

9 Commission may deny a State’s participation in the Compact or,
10 in accordance with the requirements of Section 10.B, terminate a
11 Member State’s participation in the Compact, if it determines that
12 a constitutional requirement of a Member State is a material
13 departure from the Compact. Otherwise, if this Compact shall be
14 held to be contrary to the constitution of any Member State, the
15 Compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining
16 Member States and in full force and effect as to the Member State
17 affected as to all severable matters.
18
19 SECTION 13. CONSISTENT EFFECT AND

3 any person, and may be fully copied or an abstract or memorandum
4 may be prepared from those public books and public records. Any
5 such copies, abstracts or memoranda may be used to supply the
6 general public with copies, abstracts or memoranda of the records or
7 may be used in any other way to the advantage of the governmental
8 entity or of the general public. This section does not supersede or in
9 any manner affect the federal laws governing copyrights or enlarge,
10 diminish or affect in any other manner the rights of a person in any
11 written book or record which is copyrighted pursuant to federal law.
12 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record
13 which is copyrighted solely because it is copyrighted.
14 3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a
15 public book or record shall not deny a request made pursuant to
16 subsection 1 to inspect or copy or receive a copy of a public book or
17 record on the basis that the requested public book or record contains
18 information that is confidential if the governmental entity can
19 redact, delete, conceal or separate, including, without limitation,
20 electronically, the confidential information from the information
21 included in the public book or record that is not otherwise
22 confidential.

29 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
30 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
31 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by
32 means of an electronic medium would:
33 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
34 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential
35 and that cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from
36 information that is not otherwise confidential.
37 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who
38 has legal custody or control of a public record:
39 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the
40 medium that is requested because the officer, employee or agent has
41 already prepared or would prefer to provide the copy in a different
42 medium.
