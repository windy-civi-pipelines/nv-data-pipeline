AN ACT relating to industrial insurance; authorizing an injured
employee with a claim for an occupational lung disease or
occupational heart disease to seek treatment or services
from a physician or chiropractic physician which is not on
the panel of physicians and chiropractic physicians
maintained by the Administrator of the Division of
Industrial Relations of the Department of Business and
Industry under certain circumstances; setting forth certain
requirements for the reimbursement of the costs for such
treatment or services; providing for a penalty for failure to
comply with those requirements; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes the Nevada Industrial Insurance Act and the Nevada
2 Occupational Diseases Act, which provide for the payment of compensation to
3 employees who are injured or disabled as a result of an occupational injury or
4 occupational disease. (Chapters 616A-616D and 617 of NRS) Existing law
5 provides for the payment of compensation for claims for the occupational diseases
6 of lung disease and heart disease for certain firefighters, arson investigators and
7 police officers. (NRS 617.455, 617.457)
8 Existing law requires the Administrator of the Division of Industrial Relations
9 of the Department of Business and Industry to maintain a panel of physicians and
10 chiropractic physicians to treat the injured employees of certain employers under
11 the Nevada Industrial Insurance Act and the Nevada Occupational Diseases Act.
12 (NRS 616C.087, 616C.090) Existing law authorizes an injured employee to choose
13 a treating physician or chiropractic physician from the panel unless the insurer of
14 the injured employee’s employer has entered into certain contracts with an
15 organization for managed care or with providers of health care, in which case the
-
*SB376*

– 2 –
16 injured employee is required to choose a physician or chiropractic physician in
17 accordance with the provisions of the contract. (NRS 616C.090)
18 Sections 1, 2 and 4 of this bill provide an exception from those requirements to
19 authorize certain injured employees who have filed a claim for the occupational
20 diseases of lung disease or heart disease to seek treatment or other services from a
21 physician or chiropractic physician of his or her own choice if the panel of treating
22 physicians or chiropractic physicians maintained by the Administrator contains
23 fewer than 12 physicians or chiropractic physicians who accept and treat injured
24 employees in a discipline or specialization appropriate for the treatment of or the
25 provision of other services related to the occupational disease of the injured
26 employee.
27 Section 2 also provides that the injured employee or certain other persons who
28 pay for the treatment or services may seek full reimbursement for the costs of the
29 treatment or services from the employer of the injured employee or certain other
30 persons who are obligated to provide applicable coverage or benefits to the injured
31 employee by providing a request for reimbursement, which includes certain
32 specified contents. Section 2 requires a person from whom reimbursement is
33 sought to fully reimburse the requester not later than 30 days after receiving notice
34 of the request for reimbursement. Under section 2, if the person fails to fully
35 reimburse the requester within that time, the Administrator is required to order the
36 person to pay to the requester an amount that is equal to three times the amount of
37 the reimbursement for each day the reimbursement remains unpaid beginning on
38 the date on which the person received the request for reimbursement.
39 Sections 3 and 5 of this bill revise provisions of existing law relating to the
40 selection of a treating physician or chiropractic physician to reflect the selection of
41 a physician or chiropractic physician pursuant to section 2.

7 5. If the injured employee is not satisfied with the physician or
8 chiropractic physician selected by himself or herself or by the
9 insurer, the organization for managed care or the provider of health
10 care pursuant to subsection 4, the injured employee may make an
11 alternative choice of physician or chiropractic physician pursuant to
12 the terms of the contract. A change in the treating physician or

15 officer. A request for a change of physician or chiropractic
16 physician must be granted or denied within 10 days after a written
17 request for such a change is received from the injured employee. If

20 chiropractic physician must include the name of the new physician
21 or chiropractic physician chosen by the injured employee. If the
22 insurer denies a request for a change in the treating physician or
23 chiropractic physician under this subsection, the insurer must
24 include in a written notice of denial to the injured employee the
25 specific reason for the denial of the request.
26 6. Except when emergency medical care is required and except
27 as otherwise provided in NRS 616C.055, the insurer is not
28 responsible for any charges for medical treatment or other accident
29 benefits furnished or ordered by any physician, chiropractic
30 physician or other person selected by the injured employee in
31 disregard of the provisions of this section or for any compensation
32 for any aggravation of the injured employee’s injury attributable to
33 improper treatments by such physician, chiropractic physician or
34 other person.
35 7. The Administrator may order necessary changes in a panel
36 of physicians and chiropractic physicians and shall:

19 paragraph (b) of subsection 7 may request, on a form prescribed by
20 the Administrator, to be reinstated on a panel for that discipline or
21 specialization if the physician or chiropractic physician
22 demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Administrator that he or she
23 accepts and treats injured employees for that discipline or
24 specialization.
25 11. An injured employee may receive treatment by more than
26 one physician or chiropractic physician:
27 (a) If the insurer provides written authorization for such
28 treatment; or

40 the course of employment, or his or her dependents, is entitled to
41 receive for the period of temporary total disability, 66 2/3 percent of
42 the average monthly wage.
43 2. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 616B.028 and

5 totally disabled by a physician or chiropractic physician.
6 3. If a claim for the period of temporary total disability is
7 allowed, the first payment pursuant to this section must be issued by
8 the insurer within 14 working days after receipt of the initial
9 certification of disability and regularly thereafter.
10 4. Any increase in compensation and benefits effected by the
11 amendment of subsection 1 is not retroactive.
12 5. Payments for a temporary total disability must cease when:
13 (a) A physician or chiropractic physician determines that the
