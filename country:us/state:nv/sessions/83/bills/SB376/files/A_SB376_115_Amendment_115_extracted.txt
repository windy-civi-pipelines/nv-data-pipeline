of the Department of Business and Industry under certain
circumstances; setting forth certain requirements for the reimbursement

failure to comply with those requirements; authorizing certain
notices and other documents required in certain hearings or
appeals relating to industrial insurance to be provided by means of

relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes the Nevada Industrial Insurance Act and the Nevada
2 Occupational Diseases Act, which provide for the payment of compensation to employees
3 who are injured or disabled as a result of an occupational injury or occupational disease.
4 (Chapters 616A-616D and 617 of NRS) Existing law provides for the payment of
5 compensation for claims for the occupational diseases of lung disease and heart disease for
6 certain firefighters, arson investigators and police officers. (NRS 617.455, 617.457)
7 Existing law requires the Administrator of the Division of Industrial Relations of the
8 Department of Business and Industry to maintain a panel of physicians and chiropractic
9 physicians to treat the injured employees of certain employers under the Nevada Industrial
10 Insurance Act and the Nevada Occupational Diseases Act. (NRS 616C.087, 616C.090)
11 Existing law authorizes an injured employee to choose a treating physician or chiropractic
12 physician from the panel unless the insurer of the injured employee’s employer has entered
13 into certain contracts with an organization for managed care or with providers of health care,
14 in which case the injured employee is required to choose a physician or chiropractic physician
15 in accordance with the provisions of the contract. (NRS 616C.090)
16 Sections 1, 2 and 4 of this bill provide an exception from those requirements to authorize
17 certain injured employees who have filed a claim for the occupational diseases of lung disease
18 or heart disease to seek treatment or other services from a physician or chiropractic physician
19 of his or her own choice , who meets certain other requirements, if the panel of treating
20 physicians or chiropractic physicians maintained by the Administrator contains fewer than 12
Senate Amendment No. 115 to Senate Bill No. 376 Page 4
21 physicians or chiropractic physicians [who accept and treat injured employees] in a discipline
22 or specialization appropriate for the treatment of or the provision of other services related to
23 the occupational disease of the injured employee [.] who are accepting new patients and
24 available to make an appointment within 30 days.
25 [Section] Sections 2 , 4.1 and 4.3 of this bill also [provides] provide that the injured
26 employee or certain other persons who pay for the treatment or services may seek full
27 reimbursement for the costs of the treatment or services from the employer of the injured
28 employee or certain other persons who are obligated to provide applicable coverage or
29 benefits to the injured employee by providing a request for reimbursement, which includes
30 certain specified contents. Section 2 requires a person from whom reimbursement is sought to
31 fully reimburse the requester not later than 30 days after receiving notice of the request for
32 reimbursement. Under section 2, if the person fails to fully reimburse the requester within that
33 time, the Administrator is required to order the person to pay to the requester an amount that is
34 equal to [three] two times the amount of the reimbursement [for each day the reimbursement]
35 which remains unpaid [beginning] on the date on which the [person received the request for
36 reimbursement.] Administrator issues the order.
37 Sections 3 and 5 of this bill revise provisions of existing law relating to the selection of a
38 treating physician or chiropractic physician to reflect the selection of a physician or
39 chiropractic physician pursuant to section 2.
40 Existing law authorizes an aggrieved party in a contested case relating to industrial
41 insurance to: (1) request a hearing before a hearing officer; and (2) appeal from a
42 decision of a hearing officer or from a determination made by certain parties. (NRS
43 616C.315, 616C.330, 616C.345, 616C.355) Sections 4.5, 4.7 and 4.9 of this bill authorize
44 certain notices and other documents required in such hearings and appeals to be
45 provided by means of an electronic filing system that complies with the Nevada
46 Electronic Filing and Conversion Rules adopted by the Nevada Supreme Court.

28 impractical for the injured employee to continue treatment with the physician or
29 chiropractic physician, the injured employee must choose a treating physician or
30 chiropractic physician who has agreed to the terms of that contract unless the
31 insurer authorizes the injured employee to choose another physician or chiropractic
32 physician. If the treating physician or chiropractic physician refers the injured
33 employee to a specialist for treatment, the insurer shall provide to the injured
34 employee a list that includes the name of each physician or chiropractic physician
35 with that specialization who is available pursuant to the terms of the contract with
36 the organization for managed care or with providers of health care pursuant to NRS
37 616B.527, as appropriate. Not later than 14 days after receiving the list, the injured
38 employee shall select a physician or chiropractic physician from the list. If the

41 chiropractic physician with that specialization is not available pursuant to the terms
42 of the contract, the organization for managed care or the provider of health care
43 may select a physician or chiropractic physician with that specialization.
44 5. If the injured employee is not satisfied with the physician or chiropractic
45 physician selected by himself or herself or by the insurer, the organization for
46 managed care or the provider of health care pursuant to subsection 4, the injured
47 employee may make an alternative choice of physician or chiropractic physician
48 pursuant to the terms of the contract. A change in the treating physician or

50 insurer or by order of a hearing officer or appeals officer. A request for a change of
51 physician or chiropractic physician must be granted or denied within 10 days after a
52 written request for such a change is received from the injured employee. If no
53 action is taken on the request within 10 days, the request shall be deemed granted.

5 notice of denial to the injured employee the specific reason for the denial of the
6 request.
7 6. Except when emergency medical care is required and except as otherwise
8 provided in NRS 616C.055, the insurer is not responsible for any charges for
9 medical treatment or other accident benefits furnished or ordered by any physician,
10 chiropractic physician or other person selected by the injured employee in disregard
11 of the provisions of this section or for any compensation for any aggravation of the
12 injured employee’s injury attributable to improper treatments by such physician,
13 chiropractic physician or other person.

26 industrial injuries or occupational diseases; or

41 demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Administrator that he or she accepts and
42 treats injured employees for that discipline or specialization.

44 or chiropractic physician:

48 occupational disease.
49 (b) Do not apply to a provider of health care that is a hospital as defined in

11 managed care, third-party administrator or employer who provides accident benefits
12 to pay to the injured employee or the health or casualty insurer the amount which
13 the injured employee or the health or casualty insurer paid that is allowed for the
14 treatment or other services set forth in the schedule of fees and charges established
15 pursuant to NRS 616C.260 or, if the insurer has contracted with an organization for

17 amount that is allowed for the treatment or other services under that contract.
18 4. If:
19 (a) A hearing officer, appeals officer or district court issues an order or
20 otherwise renders a decision requiring an insurer, organization for managed care,
21 third-party administrator or employer to pay for treatment or other services
22 provided to an injured employee;
23 (b) The insurer, organization for managed care, third-party administrator or
24 employer appeals the order or decision, but is unable to obtain a stay of the order or

47 2. The notice must include a statement that the injured employee may be
48 represented by a private attorney or seek assistance and advice from the Nevada
49 Attorney for Injured Workers.
50 3. If necessary to resolve a medical question concerning an injured
51 employee’s condition or to determine the necessity of treatment for which
52 authorization for payment has been denied, the hearing officer may order an
53 independent medical examination, which must not involve treatment, and refer the
Senate Amendment No. 115 to Senate Bill No. 376 Page 13
1 employee to a physician or chiropractic physician of his or her choice who has
2 demonstrated special competence to treat the particular medical condition of the
3 employee, whether or not the physician or chiropractic physician is on the insurer’s
4 panel of providers of health care. If the medical question concerns the rating of a
5 permanent disability, the hearing officer may refer the employee to a rating
6 physician or chiropractic physician. The rating physician or chiropractic physician
7 must be selected at random from the list of qualified physicians and chiropractic
8 physicians maintained by the Administrator pursuant to subsection 2 of NRS

13 chiropractic physician, physician assistant or advanced practice registered nurse, in
14 addition to the opinion of an authorized treating physician, chiropractic physician,
15 physician assistant or advanced practice registered nurse, in determining the
16 compensation payable to the injured employee.
17 5. If an injured employee has requested payment for the cost of obtaining a
18 second determination of his or her percentage of disability pursuant to NRS
19 616C.100, the hearing officer shall decide whether the determination of the higher
20 percentage of disability made pursuant to NRS 616C.100 is appropriate and, if so,
21 may order the insurer to pay to the employee an amount equal to the maximum
22 allowable fee established by the Administrator pursuant to NRS 616C.260 for the
23 type of service performed, or the usual fee of that physician or chiropractic
24 physician for such service, whichever is less.
25 6. The hearing officer shall order an insurer, organization for managed care or
26 employer who provides accident benefits for injured employees pursuant to NRS
27 616C.265 to pay to the appropriate person the charges of a provider of health care if
28 the conditions of NRS 616C.138 are satisfied.
29 7. The hearing officer may allow or forbid the presence of a court reporter
30 and the use of a tape recorder in a hearing.
31 8. The hearing officer shall render his or her decision within 15 days after:
32 (a) The hearing; or
33 (b) The hearing officer receives a copy of the report from the medical
34 examination the hearing officer requested.
35 9. The hearing officer shall render a decision in the most efficient format
36 developed by the Chief of the Hearings Division of the Department of
37 Administration.
38 10. The hearing officer shall give notice of the decision to each party by mail
39 [.] or by means of an electronic filing system that complies with the Nevada
40 Electronic Filing and Conversion Rules adopted by the Nevada Supreme Court.
41 The hearing officer shall include with the notice of the decision the necessary forms
42 for appealing from the decision.
43 11. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 616C.380, the decision of the
44 hearing officer is not stayed if an appeal from that decision is taken unless an
45 application for a stay is submitted by a party. If such an application is submitted,
46 the decision is automatically stayed until a determination is made on the
47 application. A determination on the application must be made within 30 days after
48 the filing of the application. If, after reviewing the application, a stay is not granted
49 by the hearing officer or an appeals officer, the decision must be complied with
50 within 10 days after the refusal to grant a stay.
51 12. References to a physician assistant and an advanced practice registered
52 nurse in this section are for the purposes of the examination and treatment of an
53 injured employee which are authorized to be provided by a physician assistant or
Senate Amendment No. 115 to Senate Bill No. 376 Page 14
1 advanced practice registered nurse in the exclusive context of an initial examination
2 and treatment pursuant to NRS 616C.010.
3 Sec. 4.7. NRS 616C.345 is hereby amended to read as follows:
4 616C.345 1. Any party aggrieved by a decision of the hearing officer
5 relating to a claim for compensation may appeal from the decision by, except as
6 otherwise provided in subsections 9, 10 and 11, filing a notice of appeal with an
7 appeals officer within 30 days after the date of the decision.
8 2. A claimant aggrieved by a written determination of the denial of a claim, in
9 whole or in part, by an insurer, or the failure of an insurer to respond in writing
10 within 30 days to a written request of the claimant mailed to the insurer, concerning
11 a claim arising from the provisions of NRS 617.453, 617.455, 617.457, 617.485 or
12 617.487 may file a notice of a contested claim with an appeals officer. The notice
13 must include the information required pursuant to subsection 3 and, except as
14 otherwise provided in subsections 9 to 12, inclusive, must be filed within 70 days
15 after the date on which the notice of the insurer’s determination was mailed or, if
16 requested by the claimant or the person acting on behalf of the claimant, sent by
17 facsimile or other electronic transmission the proof of sending and receipt of which
18 is readily verifiable by the insurer or the unanswered written request was mailed to
19 the insurer, as applicable. The failure of an insurer to respond in writing to a written
20 request for a determination within 30 days after receipt of such a request shall be
21 deemed by the appeals officer to be a denial of the request. The insurer shall
22 provide, without cost, the forms necessary to file a notice of a contested claim to
23 any person who requests them.
24 3. A hearing must not be scheduled until the following information is
25 provided to the appeals officer:
26 (a) The name of:
27 (1) The claimant;
28 (2) The employer; and
29 (3) The insurer or third-party administrator;
30 (b) The number of the claim; and
31 (c) If applicable, a copy of the letter of determination being appealed or, if such
32 a copy is unavailable, the date of the determination and the issues stated in the
33 determination.
34 4. If a dispute is required to be submitted to a procedure for resolving
35 complaints pursuant to NRS 616C.305 and:
36 (a) A final determination was rendered pursuant to that procedure; or
37 (b) The dispute was not resolved pursuant to that procedure within 14 days
38 after it was submitted,
39  any party to the dispute may, except as otherwise provided in subsections 9 to
40 12, inclusive, file a notice of appeal within 70 days after the date on which the final
41 determination was mailed to the employee, or the dependent of the employee, or the
42 unanswered request for resolution was submitted. Failure to render a written
43 determination within 30 days after receipt of such a request shall be deemed by the
44 appeals officer to be a denial of the request.
45 5. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 616C.380, the filing of a notice of
46 appeal does not automatically stay the enforcement of the decision of a hearing
47 officer or a determination rendered pursuant to NRS 616C.305. The appeals officer
48 may order a stay, when appropriate, upon the application of a party. If such an
49 application is submitted, the decision is automatically stayed until a determination
50 is made concerning the application. A determination on the application must be
51 made within 30 days after the filing of the application. If a stay is not granted by the
52 officer after reviewing the application, the decision must be complied with within
53 10 days after the date of the refusal to grant a stay.

8 pay all additional costs directly related to an alternative location, at any other place
9 of convenience to the parties, at the discretion of the appeals officer; and
10 (b) Give notice by mail , [or] by personal service or by means of an electronic
11 filing system that complies with the Nevada Electronic Filing and Conversion
12 Rules adopted by the Nevada Supreme Court to all parties to the matter and their
13 attorneys or agents at least 30 days before the date and time scheduled.

19  may be submitted to the appeals officer only if all parties to the appeal or
20 contested claim agree to the request.
21 8. An appeal or contested claim may be continued upon written stipulation of
22 all parties, or upon good cause shown.
23 9. The period specified in subsection 1, 2 or 4 within which a notice of appeal
24 or a notice of a contested claim must be filed may be extended for an additional 90
25 days if the person aggrieved shows by a preponderance of the evidence that the

32 receipt of which is readily verifiable.
33 11. Failure to file a notice of appeal within the period specified in subsection
34 1 or 4 may be excused if the party aggrieved shows by a preponderance of the
35 evidence that he or she did not receive the notice of the determination and the forms
36 necessary to appeal the determination. The claimant, employer or insurer shall
37 notify the hearing officer of a change of address.
38 12. Failure to file a notice of a contested claim within the period specified in
39 subsection 2 may be excused if the claimant shows by a preponderance of the
40 evidence that he or she did not receive the notice of the determination and the forms
41 necessary to file the notice. The claimant or employer shall notify the insurer of a
42 change of address.
43 13. Within 10 days after receiving a notice of a contested claim pursuant to

4 unless all parties agree to the introduction.
5 Sec. 4.9. NRS 616C.355 is hereby amended to read as follows:
6 616C.355 At any time 10 or more days before a scheduled hearing before an
7 appeals officer, the Administrator or the Administrator’s designee, a party shall
8 mail , [or] deliver by personal service or deliver by means of an electronic filing
9 system that complies with the Nevada Electronic Filing and Conversion Rules
10 adopted by the Nevada Supreme Court, to the opposing party any affidavit or
11 declaration which the party proposes to introduce into evidence and notice to the
12 effect that unless the opposing party, within 7 days after the mailing or delivery of
13 such affidavit or declaration, mails or delivers to the proponent a request to cross-
14 examine the affiant or declarant, the opposing party’s right to cross-examine the
15 affiant or declarant is waived and the affidavit or declaration, if introduced into
16 evidence, will have the same effect as if the affiant or declarant had given sworn
17 testimony before the appeals officer, the Administrator or the Administrator’s
18 designee.
19 Sec. 5. NRS 616C.475 is hereby amended to read as follows:
20 616C.475 1. Except as otherwise provided in this section, NRS 616C.175
21 and 616C.390, every employee in the employ of an employer, within the provisions
22 of chapters 616A to 616D, inclusive, of NRS, who is injured by accident arising out
23 of and in the course of employment, or his or her dependents, is entitled to receive
24 for the period of temporary total disability, 66 2/3 percent of the average monthly
25 wage.
26 2. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 616B.028 and 616B.029, an injured
27 employee or his or her dependents are not entitled to accrue or be paid any benefits
28 for a temporary total disability during the time the injured employee is incarcerated.
29 The injured employee or his or her dependents are entitled to receive such benefits
30 when the injured employee is released from incarceration if the injured employee is
31 certified as temporarily totally disabled by a physician or chiropractic physician.
32 3. If a claim for the period of temporary total disability is allowed, the first
33 payment pursuant to this section must be issued by the insurer within 14 working
34 days after receipt of the initial certification of disability and regularly thereafter.
35 4. Any increase in compensation and benefits effected by the amendment of
36 subsection 1 is not retroactive.
37 5. Payments for a temporary total disability must cease when:
38 (a) A physician or chiropractic physician determines that the employee is
39 physically capable of any gainful employment for which the employee is suited,
40 after giving consideration to the employee’s education, training and experience;
41 (b) The employer offers the employee light-duty employment or employment
42 that is modified according to the limitations or restrictions imposed by a physician
43 or chiropractic physician pursuant to subsection 7; or
44 (c) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 616B.028 and 616B.029, the
45 employee is incarcerated.
46 6. Each insurer may, with each check that it issues to an injured employee for
47 a temporary total disability, include a form approved by the Division for the injured
48 employee to request continued compensation for the temporary total disability.
49 7. A certification of disability issued by a physician or chiropractic physician
50 must:
51 (a) Include the period of disability and a description of any physical limitations
52 or restrictions imposed upon the work of the employee;
Senate Amendment No. 115 to Senate Bill No. 376 Page 17
1 (b) Specify whether the limitations or restrictions are permanent or temporary;
2 and
3 (c) Be signed by the treating physician or chiropractic physician authorized
4 pursuant to NRS 616B.527 or appropriately chosen pursuant to subsection 4 or 5 of
5 NRS 616C.090 [.] or [subsection 1 of] section 2 of this act.
6 8. If the certification of disability specifies that the physical limitations or
7 restrictions are temporary, the employer of the employee at the time of the
8 employee’s accident may offer temporary, light-duty employment to the employee.
9 If the employer makes such an offer, the employer shall confirm the offer in writing
10 within 10 days after making the offer. The making, acceptance or rejection of an
11 offer of temporary, light-duty employment pursuant to this subsection does not
12 affect the eligibility of the employee to receive vocational rehabilitation services,
13 including compensation, and does not exempt the employer from complying with
14 NRS 616C.545 to 616C.575, inclusive, and 616C.590 or the regulations adopted by
15 the Division governing vocational rehabilitation services. Any offer of temporary,
16 light-duty employment made by the employer must specify a position that:
17 (a) Is substantially similar to the employee’s position at the time of his or her
18 injury in relation to the location of the employment and the hours the employee is
19 required to work;
20 (b) Provides a gross wage that is:
21 (1) If the position is in the same classification of employment, equal to the
22 gross wage the employee was earning at the time of his or her injury; or
23 (2) If the position is not in the same classification of employment,
24 substantially similar to the gross wage the employee was earning at the time of his
25 or her injury; and
26 (c) Has the same employment benefits as the position of the employee at the
27 time of his or her injury.
28 Sec. 6. The amendatory provisions of this act apply prospectively with regard
29 to any claim filed pursuant to chapters 616A to 616D, inclusive, or 617 of NRS
30 which is filed on or after October 1, 2025.

AN ACT relating to industrial insurance; authorizing an injured employee with a
claim for an occupational lung disease or occupational heart disease to
seek treatment or services from a physician or chiropractic physician
which is not on the panel of physicians and chiropractic physicians
maintained by the Administrator of the Division of Industrial Relations
of the Department of Business and Industry under certain
circumstances; setting forth certain requirements for the reimbursement
of the costs for such treatment or services; providing for a penalty for
failure to comply with those requirements; authorizing certain
notices and other documents required in certain hearings or
appeals relating to industrial insurance to be provided by means of
an electronic filing system; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes the Nevada Industrial Insurance Act and the Nevada
2 Occupational Diseases Act, which provide for the payment of compensation to employees
3 who are injured or disabled as a result of an occupational injury or occupational disease.
4 (Chapters 616A-616D and 617 of NRS) Existing law provides for the payment of
5 compensation for claims for the occupational diseases of lung disease and heart disease for
6 certain firefighters, arson investigators and police officers. (NRS 617.455, 617.457)
7 Existing law requires the Administrator of the Division of Industrial Relations of the
8 Department of Business and Industry to maintain a panel of physicians and chiropractic
9 physicians to treat the injured employees of certain employers under the Nevada Industrial
10 Insurance Act and the Nevada Occupational Diseases Act. (NRS 616C.087, 616C.090)
11 Existing law authorizes an injured employee to choose a treating physician or chiropractic
12 physician from the panel unless the insurer of the injured employee’s employer has entered
13 into certain contracts with an organization for managed care or with providers of health care,
14 in which case the injured employee is required to choose a physician or chiropractic physician
15 in accordance with the provisions of the contract. (NRS 616C.090)
16 Sections 1, 2 and 4 of this bill provide an exception from those requirements to authorize
17 certain injured employees who have filed a claim for the occupational diseases of lung disease
18 or heart disease to seek treatment or other services from a physician or chiropractic physician
19 of his or her own choice , who meets certain other requirements, if the panel of treating
20 physicians or chiropractic physicians maintained by the Administrator contains fewer than 12

Senate Amendment No. 115 to Senate Bill No. 376 Page 4
21 physicians or chiropractic physicians [who accept and treat injured employees] in a discipline
22 or specialization appropriate for the treatment of or the provision of other services related to
23 the occupational disease of the injured employee [.] who are accepting new patients and
24 available to make an appointment within 30 days.
25 [Section] Sections 2 , 4.1 and 4.3 of this bill also [provides] provide that the injured
26 employee or certain other persons who pay for the treatment or services may seek full
27 reimbursement for the costs of the treatment or services from the employer of the injured
28 employee or certain other persons who are obligated to provide applicable coverage or
29 benefits to the injured employee by providing a request for reimbursement, which includes
30 certain specified contents. Section 2 requires a person from whom reimbursement is sought to
31 fully reimburse the requester not later than 30 days after receiving notice of the request for
32 reimbursement. Under section 2, if the person fails to fully reimburse the requester within that
33 time, the Administrator is required to order the person to pay to the requester an amount that is
34 equal to [three] two times the amount of the reimbursement [for each day the reimbursement]
35 which remains unpaid [beginning] on the date on which the [person received the request for
36 reimbursement.] Administrator issues the order.
37 Sections 3 and 5 of this bill revise provisions of existing law relating to the selection of a
38 treating physician or chiropractic physician to reflect the selection of a physician or
39 chiropractic physician pursuant to section 2.
40 Existing law authorizes an aggrieved party in a contested case relating to industrial
41 insurance to: (1) request a hearing before a hearing officer; and (2) appeal from a
42 decision of a hearing officer or from a determination made by certain parties. (NRS
43 616C.315, 616C.330, 616C.345, 616C.355) Sections 4.5, 4.7 and 4.9 of this bill authorize
44 certain notices and other documents required in such hearings and appeals to be
45 provided by means of an electronic filing system that complies with the Nevada
46 Electronic Filing and Conversion Rules adopted by the Nevada Supreme Court.

15 Sec. 4. NRS 616C.090 is hereby amended to read as follows:
16 616C.090 1. The Administrator shall establish, maintain and update not less
17 frequently than annually on or before July 1 of each year, a panel of physicians and
18 chiropractic physicians who have demonstrated special competence and interest in

24 (c) The legal name of the practice of the physician or chiropractic physician
25 and the name under which the practice does business.
26 (d) The street address of the location of every office of the physician or
27 chiropractic physician.
28 (e) The telephone number of every office of the physician or chiropractic
29 physician.
30 (f) Every discipline and specialization practiced by the physician or
31 chiropractic physician.
32 (g) Every condition and part of the body which the physician or chiropractic
33 physician will treat.
34 2. Every employer whose insurer has not entered into a contract with an
35 organization for managed care or with providers of health care pursuant to NRS
36 616B.527 shall maintain a list of those physicians and chiropractic physicians on
37 the panel who are reasonably accessible to his or her employees.
38 3. [An] Except as otherwise provided in section 2 of this act, an injured
39 employee whose employer’s insurer has not entered into a contract with an
40 organization for managed care or with providers of health care pursuant to NRS
41 616B.527 may choose a treating physician or chiropractic physician from the panel
42 of physicians and chiropractic physicians. If the injured employee is not satisfied
43 with the first physician or chiropractic physician he or she so chooses, the injured
44 employee may make an alternative choice of physician or chiropractic physician
45 from the panel if the choice is made within 90 days after his or her injury. The
46 insurer shall notify the first physician or chiropractic physician in writing. The
47 notice must be postmarked within 3 working days after the insurer receives
48 knowledge of the change. The first physician or chiropractic physician must be
49 reimbursed only for the services the physician or chiropractic physician, as
50 applicable, rendered to the injured employee up to and including the date of
51 notification. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, any further change is
52 subject to the approval of the insurer or by order of a hearing officer or appeals
53 officer. A request for a change of physician or chiropractic physician must be

Senate Amendment No. 115 to Senate Bill No. 376 Page 8
1 granted or denied within 10 days after a written request for such a change is
2 received from the injured employee. If the insurer takes no action on the request
3 within 10 days, the request shall be deemed granted. Any request for a change of
4 physician or chiropractic physician must include the name of the new physician or
5 chiropractic physician chosen by the injured employee. If the treating physician or
6 chiropractic physician refers the injured employee to a specialist for treatment, the
7 insurer shall provide to the injured employee a list that includes the name of each
8 physician or chiropractic physician with that specialization who is on the panel. Not
9 later than 14 days after receiving the list, the injured employee shall select a
10 physician or chiropractic physician from the list.
11 4. [An] Except as otherwise provided in section 2 of this act, an injured
12 employee whose employer’s insurer has entered into a contract with an
13 organization for managed care or with providers of health care pursuant to NRS
14 616B.527 must choose a treating physician or chiropractic physician pursuant to the
15 terms of that contract. If the injured employee is not satisfied with the first
16 physician or chiropractic physician he or she so chooses, the injured employee may
17 make an alternative choice of physician or chiropractic physician pursuant to the
18 terms of the contract without the approval of the insurer if the choice is made
19 within 90 days after his or her injury. Except as otherwise provided in this
20 subsection, any further change is subject to the approval of the insurer or by order
21 of a hearing officer or appeals officer. A request for a change of physician or
22 chiropractic physician must be granted or denied within 10 days after a written
23 request for such a change is received from the injured employee. If the insurer takes
24 no action on the request within 10 days, the request shall be deemed granted. If the
25 injured employee, after choosing a treating physician or chiropractic physician,
26 moves to a county which is not served by the organization for managed care or
27 providers of health care named in the contract and the insurer determines that it is
28 impractical for the injured employee to continue treatment with the physician or
29 chiropractic physician, the injured employee must choose a treating physician or
30 chiropractic physician who has agreed to the terms of that contract unless the
31 insurer authorizes the injured employee to choose another physician or chiropractic
32 physician. If the treating physician or chiropractic physician refers the injured
33 employee to a specialist for treatment, the insurer shall provide to the injured
34 employee a list that includes the name of each physician or chiropractic physician
35 with that specialization who is available pursuant to the terms of the contract with
36 the organization for managed care or with providers of health care pursuant to NRS
37 616B.527, as appropriate. Not later than 14 days after receiving the list, the injured
38 employee shall select a physician or chiropractic physician from the list. If the
39 employee fails to select a physician or chiropractic physician, the insurer may select
40 a physician or chiropractic physician with that specialization. If a physician or
41 chiropractic physician with that specialization is not available pursuant to the terms
42 of the contract, the organization for managed care or the provider of health care
43 may select a physician or chiropractic physician with that specialization.
44 5. If the injured employee is not satisfied with the physician or chiropractic

47 officer or a determination rendered pursuant to NRS 616C.305. The appeals officer

49 application is submitted, the decision is automatically stayed until a determination

32 3. If a claim for the period of temporary total disability is allowed, the first
33 payment pursuant to this section must be issued by the insurer within 14 working
34 days after receipt of the initial certification of disability and regularly thereafter.
35 4. Any increase in compensation and benefits effected by the amendment of
36 subsection 1 is not retroactive.
37 5. Payments for a temporary total disability must cease when:
38 (a) A physician or chiropractic physician determines that the employee is
39 physically capable of any gainful employment for which the employee is suited,
40 after giving consideration to the employee’s education, training and experience;
41 (b) The employer offers the employee light-duty employment or employment
42 that is modified according to the limitations or restrictions imposed by a physician
43 or chiropractic physician pursuant to subsection 7; or
44 (c) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 616B.028 and 616B.029, the
45 employee is incarcerated.
46 6. Each insurer may, with each check that it issues to an injured employee for
47 a temporary total disability, include a form approved by the Division for the injured
48 employee to request continued compensation for the temporary total disability.
49 7. A certification of disability issued by a physician or chiropractic physician
50 must:
51 (a) Include the period of disability and a description of any physical limitations
52 or restrictions imposed upon the work of the employee;

Senate Amendment No. 115 to Senate Bill No. 376 Page 17
1 (b) Specify whether the limitations or restrictions are permanent or temporary;
2 and
3 (c) Be signed by the treating physician or chiropractic physician authorized
4 pursuant to NRS 616B.527 or appropriately chosen pursuant to subsection 4 or 5 of
5 NRS 616C.090 [.] or [subsection 1 of] section 2 of this act.
6 8. If the certification of disability specifies that the physical limitations or
7 restrictions are temporary, the employer of the employee at the time of the
8 employee’s accident may offer temporary, light-duty employment to the employee.
9 If the employer makes such an offer, the employer shall confirm the offer in writing
10 within 10 days after making the offer. The making, acceptance or rejection of an
11 offer of temporary, light-duty employment pursuant to this subsection does not
12 affect the eligibility of the employee to receive vocational rehabilitation services,
13 including compensation, and does not exempt the employer from complying with
14 NRS 616C.545 to 616C.575, inclusive, and 616C.590 or the regulations adopted by
15 the Division governing vocational rehabilitation services. Any offer of temporary,
16 light-duty employment made by the employer must specify a position that:
17 (a) Is substantially similar to the employee’s position at the time of his or her
18 injury in relation to the location of the employment and the hours the employee is
19 required to work;
20 (b) Provides a gross wage that is:
21 (1) If the position is in the same classification of employment, equal to the
22 gross wage the employee was earning at the time of his or her injury; or
23 (2) If the position is not in the same classification of employment,
24 substantially similar to the gross wage the employee was earning at the time of his
25 or her injury; and
26 (c) Has the same employment benefits as the position of the employee at the
27 time of his or her injury.
28 Sec. 6. The amendatory provisions of this act apply prospectively with regard
29 to any claim filed pursuant to chapters 616A to 616D, inclusive, or 617 of NRS
30 which is filed on or after October 1, 2025.
