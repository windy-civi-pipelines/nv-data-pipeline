AN ACT relating to industrial insurance; authorizing an injured
employee with a claim for an occupational lung disease or
occupational heart disease to seek treatment or services
from a physician or chiropractic physician which is not on
the panel of physicians and chiropractic physicians
maintained by the Administrator of the Division of
Industrial Relations of the Department of Business and
Industry under certain circumstances; setting forth certain
requirements for the reimbursement of the costs for such
treatment or services; providing for a penalty for failure to
comply with those requirements; authorizing certain
notices and other documents required in certain hearings
or appeals relating to industrial insurance to be provided

other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes the Nevada Industrial Insurance Act and the Nevada
2 Occupational Diseases Act, which provide for the payment of compensation to
3 employees who are injured or disabled as a result of an occupational injury or
4 occupational disease. (Chapters 616A-616D and 617 of NRS) Existing law
5 provides for the payment of compensation for claims for the occupational diseases
6 of lung disease and heart disease for certain firefighters, arson investigators and
7 police officers. (NRS 617.455, 617.457)
8 Existing law requires the Administrator of the Division of Industrial Relations
9 of the Department of Business and Industry to maintain a panel of physicians and
10 chiropractic physicians to treat the injured employees of certain employers under
11 the Nevada Industrial Insurance Act and the Nevada Occupational Diseases Act.
12 (NRS 616C.087, 616C.090) Existing law authorizes an injured employee to choose
-
*SB376_R1*

– 2 –
13 a treating physician or chiropractic physician from the panel unless the insurer of
14 the injured employee’s employer has entered into certain contracts with an
15 organization for managed care or with providers of health care, in which case the
16 injured employee is required to choose a physician or chiropractic physician in
17 accordance with the provisions of the contract. (NRS 616C.090)
18 Sections 1, 2 and 4 of this bill provide an exception from those requirements to
19 authorize certain injured employees who have filed a claim for the occupational
20 diseases of lung disease or heart disease to seek treatment or other services from a
21 physician or chiropractic physician of his or her own choice, who meets certain
22 other requirements, if the panel of treating physicians or chiropractic physicians
23 maintained by the Administrator contains fewer than 12 physicians or chiropractic
24 physicians in a discipline or specialization appropriate for the treatment of or the
25 provision of other services related to the occupational disease of the injured
26 employee who are accepting new patients and available to make an appointment
27 within 30 days.
28 Sections 2, 4.1 and 4.3 of this bill also provide that the injured employee or
29 certain other persons who pay for the treatment or services may seek full
30 reimbursement for the costs of the treatment or services from the employer of the
31 injured employee or certain other persons who are obligated to provide applicable
32 coverage or benefits to the injured employee by providing a request for
33 reimbursement, which includes certain specified contents. Section 2 requires a
34 person from whom reimbursement is sought to fully reimburse the requester not
35 later than 30 days after receiving notice of the request for reimbursement. Under
36 section 2, if the person fails to fully reimburse the requester within that time, the
37 Administrator is required to order the person to pay to the requester an amount that
38 is equal to two times the amount of the reimbursement which remains unpaid on the
39 date on which the Administrator issues the order.
40 Sections 3 and 5 of this bill revise provisions of existing law relating to the
41 selection of a treating physician or chiropractic physician to reflect the selection of
42 a physician or chiropractic physician pursuant to section 2.
43 Existing law authorizes an aggrieved party in a contested case relating to
44 industrial insurance to: (1) request a hearing before a hearing officer; and (2) appeal
45 from a decision of a hearing officer or from a determination made by certain
46 parties. (NRS 616C.315, 616C.330, 616C.345, 616C.355) Sections 4.5, 4.7 and 4.9
47 of this bill authorize certain notices and other documents required in such hearings
48 and appeals to be provided by means of an electronic filing system that complies
49 with the Nevada Electronic Filing and Conversion Rules adopted by the Nevada
50 Supreme Court.

42 automatically stayed until a determination is made on the

44 30 days after the filing of the application. If, after reviewing the

1 officer, the decision must be complied with within 10 days after the

28 unanswered written request was mailed to the insurer, as applicable.
29 The failure of an insurer to respond in writing to a written request
30 for a determination within 30 days after receipt of such a request

32 The insurer shall provide, without cost, the forms necessary to file a
33 notice of a contested claim to any person who requests them.
34 3. A hearing must not be scheduled until the following

13 a notice of appeal does not automatically stay the enforcement of the
14 decision of a hearing officer or a determination rendered pursuant to
15 NRS 616C.305. The appeals officer may order a stay, when
16 appropriate, upon the application of a party. If such an application is

26 the average monthly wage.
27 2. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 616B.028 and
28 616B.029, an injured employee or his or her dependents are not
29 entitled to accrue or be paid any benefits for a temporary total
30 disability during the time the injured employee is incarcerated. The
31 injured employee or his or her dependents are entitled to receive
32 such benefits when the injured employee is released from
33 incarceration if the injured employee is certified as temporarily
34 totally disabled by a physician or chiropractic physician.
35 3. If a claim for the period of temporary total disability is
36 allowed, the first payment pursuant to this section must be issued by
37 the insurer within 14 working days after receipt of the initial
38 certification of disability and regularly thereafter.

6 616B.029, the employee is incarcerated.
7 6. Each insurer may, with each check that it issues to an injured
8 employee for a temporary total disability, include a form approved
9 by the Division for the injured employee to request continued
10 compensation for the temporary total disability.
11 7. A certification of disability issued by a physician or

13 (a) Include the period of disability and a description of any

37 of his or her injury in relation to the location of the employment and
38 the hours the employee is required to work;
39 (b) Provides a gross wage that is:
40 (1) If the position is in the same classification of
41 employment, equal to the gross wage the employee was earning at
42 the time of his or her injury; or

44 employment, substantially similar to the gross wage the employee
45 was earning at the time of his or her injury; and

2 employee at the time of his or her injury.
