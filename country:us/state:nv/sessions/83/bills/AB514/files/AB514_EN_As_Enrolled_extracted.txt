CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to mental health; requiring Medicaid to provide
coverage for rehabilitative residential mental health care;
requiring the State Long-Term Care Ombudsman to
investigate and provide certain assistance to providers of
rehabilitative residential mental health care; providing for the
licensure and regulation of providers of rehabilitative
residential mental health care; making appropriations to and
authorizing certain expenditures by the Division of Health
Care Financing and Policy of the Department of Health and
Human Services; providing a penalty; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law requires the Department of Health and Human Services to
administer Medicaid. (NRS 422.270) Section 1 of this bill requires the Director of
the Department to include under Medicaid coverage for rehabilitative residential
mental health care provided to certain recipients of Medicaid. Section 5 of this bill
defines the term “rehabilitative residential mental health care” to mean community-
based, medically monitored care provided in a residential setting that uses
established rehabilitative principles to achieve certain goals relating to mental
health. Section 6 of this bill applies that definition to provisions of existing law
governing medical facilities and other related entities. Section 3 of this bill makes a
conforming change to require the Director to administer the provisions of section 1
in the same manner as the provisions of existing law governing the State Plan for
Medicaid. Section 17.5 of this bill makes appropriations to and authorizes
expenditures by the Division of Health Care Financing and Policy of the
Department for costs associated with providing the coverage required by section 1.
Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation by the Division of Public
and Behavioral Health of the Department of community-based living arrangement
services, which are flexible, individualized services that are: (1) provided in the
home, for compensation, to persons with mental illness; and (2) designed and
coordinated to assist such persons in maximizing their independence. (NRS

Section 2:
449.0026, 449.0045, 449.030, 449.0302) Sections 2 and 4-16 of this bill similarly
provide for the licensure and regulation of providers of rehabilitative residential
mental health care. Section 8 requires such a provider to obtain a license as a
facility for the dependent and comply with other requirements applicable to such
facilities. Sections 7, 9 and 10 clarify that such a provider is separate from certain
other types of facilities for the dependent. Section 11 requires the State Board of
Health to adopt specific regulations governing providers of rehabilitative residential
mental health care. Sections 12 and 15 provide for the inspection of buildings
operated by such providers. Sections 13 and 14: (1) require periodic background
investigations of the personnel of a provider of rehabilitative residential mental
health care; and (2) authorize the suspension or revocation of the license of such a
provider if the provider or an employee of the provider has been convicted of
certain crimes. (NRS 449.174) Section 16 requires a provider of rehabilitative
residential mental health care to notify a person receiving such care from the
provider, his or her parent or legal guardian or another designated person upon the
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 2 –
discovery by the Division of a deficiency affecting the health and safety of a
patient. Section 4 requires such a provider to comply with provisions governing the
reporting and investigation of sentinel events and the designation of patient safety
officers. (NRS 439.800-439.890) Section 2 adds providers of rehabilitative
residential mental health care to the list of facilities that the State Long-Term Care
Ombudsman is required to investigate and assist. (NRS 427A.125-427A.165)

Section 3:
Section 17 of this bill provides that a person is not required to be a licensed nurse
to provide rehabilitative residential mental health care if the person is licensed
pursuant to the provisions of this bill. Operating as a provider of rehabilitative
residential mental health care without a license would be a misdemeanor.

Raw Text:
Assembly Bill No. 514–Committee on
Health and Human Services
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to mental health; requiring Medicaid to provide
coverage for rehabilitative residential mental health care;
requiring the State Long-Term Care Ombudsman to
investigate and provide certain assistance to providers of
rehabilitative residential mental health care; providing for the
licensure and regulation of providers of rehabilitative
residential mental health care; making appropriations to and
authorizing certain expenditures by the Division of Health
Care Financing and Policy of the Department of Health and
Human Services; providing a penalty; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law requires the Department of Health and Human Services to
administer Medicaid. (NRS 422.270) Section 1 of this bill requires the Director of
the Department to include under Medicaid coverage for rehabilitative residential
mental health care provided to certain recipients of Medicaid. Section 5 of this bill
defines the term “rehabilitative residential mental health care” to mean community-
based, medically monitored care provided in a residential setting that uses
established rehabilitative principles to achieve certain goals relating to mental
health. Section 6 of this bill applies that definition to provisions of existing law
governing medical facilities and other related entities. Section 3 of this bill makes a
conforming change to require the Director to administer the provisions of section 1
in the same manner as the provisions of existing law governing the State Plan for
Medicaid. Section 17.5 of this bill makes appropriations to and authorizes
expenditures by the Division of Health Care Financing and Policy of the
Department for costs associated with providing the coverage required by section 1.
Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation by the Division of Public
and Behavioral Health of the Department of community-based living arrangement
services, which are flexible, individualized services that are: (1) provided in the
home, for compensation, to persons with mental illness; and (2) designed and
coordinated to assist such persons in maximizing their independence. (NRS
449.0026, 449.0045, 449.030, 449.0302) Sections 2 and 4-16 of this bill similarly
provide for the licensure and regulation of providers of rehabilitative residential
mental health care. Section 8 requires such a provider to obtain a license as a
facility for the dependent and comply with other requirements applicable to such
facilities. Sections 7, 9 and 10 clarify that such a provider is separate from certain
other types of facilities for the dependent. Section 11 requires the State Board of
Health to adopt specific regulations governing providers of rehabilitative residential
mental health care. Sections 12 and 15 provide for the inspection of buildings
operated by such providers. Sections 13 and 14: (1) require periodic background
investigations of the personnel of a provider of rehabilitative residential mental
health care; and (2) authorize the suspension or revocation of the license of such a
provider if the provider or an employee of the provider has been convicted of
certain crimes. (NRS 449.174) Section 16 requires a provider of rehabilitative
residential mental health care to notify a person receiving such care from the
provider, his or her parent or legal guardian or another designated person upon the
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 2 –
discovery by the Division of a deficiency affecting the health and safety of a
patient. Section 4 requires such a provider to comply with provisions governing the
reporting and investigation of sentinel events and the designation of patient safety
officers. (NRS 439.800-439.890) Section 2 adds providers of rehabilitative
residential mental health care to the list of facilities that the State Long-Term Care
Ombudsman is required to investigate and assist. (NRS 427A.125-427A.165)
Section 17 of this bill provides that a person is not required to be a licensed nurse
to provide rehabilitative residential mental health care if the person is licensed
pursuant to the provisions of this bill. Operating as a provider of rehabilitative
residential mental health care without a license would be a misdemeanor.
(NRS 449.210)
