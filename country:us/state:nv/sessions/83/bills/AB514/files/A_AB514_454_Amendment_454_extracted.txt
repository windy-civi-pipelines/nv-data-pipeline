EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets
[omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to [Medicaid;] mental health; requiring Medicaid to provide
coverage for [certain community-based living arrangement services;]
rehabilitative residential mental health care; requiring the State
Long-Term Care Ombudsman to investigate and provide certain
assistance to providers of rehabilitative residential mental health
care; providing for the licensure and regulation of providers of
rehabilitative residential mental health care; providing a penalty;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Department of Health and Human Services to administer
2 Medicaid. (NRS 422.270) Section 1 of this bill requires the Director of the Department to
3 include under Medicaid coverage for rehabilitative residential mental health care provided
4 [through a therapeutic group home] to certain recipients of Medicaid . [who have serious
5 mental illnesses.] Section [1] 5 of this bill defines the term [“therapeutic group home”]
6 “rehabilitative residential mental health care” to mean [a provider of community-based
7 living arrangement services that supports independent, community-based living for persons
8 with serious mental illnesses.] community-based, medically monitored care provided in a
9 residential setting that uses established rehabilitative principles to achieve certain goals
10 relating to mental health. Section 6 of this bill applies that definition to provisions of
11 existing law governing medical facilities and other related entities. Section [2] 3 of this
12 bill makes a conforming change to require the Director to administer the provisions of section
13 1 in the same manner as the provisions of existing law governing the State Plan for Medicaid.
14 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation by the Division of Public and
15 Behavioral Health of the Department of community-based living arrangement services,
16 which are flexible, individualized services that are: (1) provided in the home, for
17 compensation, to persons with mental illness; and (2) designed and coordinated to assist
18 such persons in maximizing their independence. (NRS 449.0026, 449.0045, 449.030,
Assembly Amendment No. 454 to Assembly Bill No. 514 Page 4
19 449.0302) Sections 2 and 4-16 of this bill similarly provide for the licensure and
20 regulation of providers of rehabilitative residential mental health care. Section 8
21 requires such a provider to obtain a license as a facility for the dependent and comply
22 with other requirements applicable to such facilities. Sections 7, 9 and 10 clarify that
23 such a provider is separate from certain other types of facilities for the dependent.
24 Section 11 requires the State Board of Health to adopt specific regulations governing
25 providers of rehabilitative residential mental health care. Sections 12 and 15 provide for
26 the inspection of buildings operated by such providers. Sections 13 and 14: (1) require
27 periodic background investigations of the personnel of a provider of rehabilitative
28 residential mental health care; and (2) authorize the suspension or revocation of the
29 license of such a provider if the provider or an employee of the provider has been
30 convicted of certain crimes. (NRS 449.174) Section 16 requires a provider of
31 rehabilitative residential mental health care to notify a person receiving such care from
32 the provider, his or her parent or legal guardian or another designated person upon the
33 discovery by the Division of a deficiency affecting the health and safety of a patient.
34 Section 4 requires such a provider to comply with provisions governing the reporting
35 and investigation of sentinel events and the designation of patient safety officers. (NRS
36 439.800-439.890) Section 2 adds providers of rehabilitative residential mental health care
37 to the list of facilities that the State Long-Term Care Ombudsman is required to
38 investigate and assist. (NRS 427A.125-427A.165) Section 17 of this bill provides that a
39 person is not required to be a licensed nurse to provide rehabilitative residential mental
40 health care if the person is licensed pursuant to the provisions of this bill. Operating as a
41 provider of rehabilitative residential mental health care without a license would be a
42 misdemeanor. (NRS 449.210)

Makes revisions relating to mental health care.
(BDR 38-350)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.

~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets
[omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to [Medicaid;] mental health; requiring Medicaid to provide
coverage for [certain community-based living arrangement services;]
rehabilitative residential mental health care; requiring the State
Long-Term Care Ombudsman to investigate and provide certain
assistance to providers of rehabilitative residential mental health
care; providing for the licensure and regulation of providers of
rehabilitative residential mental health care; providing a penalty;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Department of Health and Human Services to administer
2 Medicaid. (NRS 422.270) Section 1 of this bill requires the Director of the Department to
3 include under Medicaid coverage for rehabilitative residential mental health care provided
4 [through a therapeutic group home] to certain recipients of Medicaid . [who have serious
5 mental illnesses.] Section [1] 5 of this bill defines the term [“therapeutic group home”]
6 “rehabilitative residential mental health care” to mean [a provider of community-based
7 living arrangement services that supports independent, community-based living for persons
8 with serious mental illnesses.] community-based, medically monitored care provided in a
9 residential setting that uses established rehabilitative principles to achieve certain goals
10 relating to mental health. Section 6 of this bill applies that definition to provisions of
11 existing law governing medical facilities and other related entities. Section [2] 3 of this
12 bill makes a conforming change to require the Director to administer the provisions of section
13 1 in the same manner as the provisions of existing law governing the State Plan for Medicaid.
14 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation by the Division of Public and
15 Behavioral Health of the Department of community-based living arrangement services,
16 which are flexible, individualized services that are: (1) provided in the home, for
17 compensation, to persons with mental illness; and (2) designed and coordinated to assist
18 such persons in maximizing their independence. (NRS 449.0026, 449.0045, 449.030,

Assembly Amendment No. 454 to Assembly Bill No. 514 Page 4
19 449.0302) Sections 2 and 4-16 of this bill similarly provide for the licensure and
20 regulation of providers of rehabilitative residential mental health care. Section 8
21 requires such a provider to obtain a license as a facility for the dependent and comply
22 with other requirements applicable to such facilities. Sections 7, 9 and 10 clarify that
23 such a provider is separate from certain other types of facilities for the dependent.
24 Section 11 requires the State Board of Health to adopt specific regulations governing
25 providers of rehabilitative residential mental health care. Sections 12 and 15 provide for
26 the inspection of buildings operated by such providers. Sections 13 and 14: (1) require
27 periodic background investigations of the personnel of a provider of rehabilitative
28 residential mental health care; and (2) authorize the suspension or revocation of the
29 license of such a provider if the provider or an employee of the provider has been
30 convicted of certain crimes. (NRS 449.174) Section 16 requires a provider of
31 rehabilitative residential mental health care to notify a person receiving such care from
32 the provider, his or her parent or legal guardian or another designated person upon the
33 discovery by the Division of a deficiency affecting the health and safety of a patient.
34 Section 4 requires such a provider to comply with provisions governing the reporting
35 and investigation of sentinel events and the designation of patient safety officers. (NRS
36 439.800-439.890) Section 2 adds providers of rehabilitative residential mental health care
37 to the list of facilities that the State Long-Term Care Ombudsman is required to
38 investigate and assist. (NRS 427A.125-427A.165) Section 17 of this bill provides that a
39 person is not required to be a licensed nurse to provide rehabilitative residential mental
40 health care if the person is licensed pursuant to the provisions of this bill. Operating as a
41 provider of rehabilitative residential mental health care without a license would be a
42 misdemeanor. (NRS 449.210)
