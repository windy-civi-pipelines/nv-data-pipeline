EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to mental health; requiring Medicaid to provide
coverage for rehabilitative residential mental health care;
requiring the State Long-Term Care Ombudsman to
investigate and provide certain assistance to providers of
rehabilitative residential mental health care; providing for
the licensure and regulation of providers of rehabilitative
residential mental health care; providing a penalty; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Department of Health and Human Services to
2 administer Medicaid. (NRS 422.270) Section 1 of this bill requires the Director of
3 the Department to include under Medicaid coverage for rehabilitative residential
4 mental health care provided to certain recipients of Medicaid. Section 5 of this bill
5 defines the term “rehabilitative residential mental health care” to mean community-
6 based, medically monitored care provided in a residential setting that uses
7 established rehabilitative principles to achieve certain goals relating to mental
8 health. Section 6 of this bill applies that definition to provisions of existing law
9 governing medical facilities and other related entities. Section 3 of this bill makes a
10 conforming change to require the Director to administer the provisions of section 1
11 in the same manner as the provisions of existing law governing the State Plan for
12 Medicaid.
13 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation by the Division of Public
14 and Behavioral Health of the Department of community-based living arrangement

15 services, which are flexible, individualized services that are: (1) provided in the
16 home, for compensation, to persons with mental illness; and (2) designed and
17 coordinated to assist such persons in maximizing their independence. (NRS
18 449.0026, 449.0045, 449.030, 449.0302) Sections 2 and 4-16 of this bill similarly
19 provide for the licensure and regulation of providers of rehabilitative residential
20 mental health care. Section 8 requires such a provider to obtain a license as a
21 facility for the dependent and comply with other requirements applicable to such
22 facilities. Sections 7, 9 and 10 clarify that such a provider is separate from certain
23 other types of facilities for the dependent. Section 11 requires the State Board of
24 Health to adopt specific regulations governing providers of rehabilitative residential
25 mental health care. Sections 12 and 15 provide for the inspection of buildings
26 operated by such providers. Sections 13 and 14: (1) require periodic background
27 investigations of the personnel of a provider of rehabilitative residential mental
28 health care; and (2) authorize the suspension or revocation of the license of such a
29 provider if the provider or an employee of the provider has been convicted of
30 certain crimes. (NRS 449.174) Section 16 requires a provider of rehabilitative
31 residential mental health care to notify a person receiving such care from the
32 provider, his or her parent or legal guardian or another designated person upon the
33 discovery by the Division of a deficiency affecting the health and safety of a
34 patient. Section 4 requires such a provider to comply with provisions governing the
35 reporting and investigation of sentinel events and the designation of patient safety
36 officers. (NRS 439.800-439.890) Section 2 adds providers of rehabilitative
37 residential mental health care to the list of facilities that the State Long-Term Care
38 Ombudsman is required to investigate and assist. (NRS 427A.125-427A.165)
39 Section 17 of this bill provides that a person is not required to be a licensed nurse
40 to provide rehabilitative residential mental health care if the person is licensed
41 pursuant to the provisions of this bill. Operating as a provider of rehabilitative
42 residential mental health care without a license would be a misdemeanor.
