EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; requiring the Division of Health Care Financing
and Policy of the Department of Health and Human Services to impose
an assessment on private emergency medical transport providers;
creating the Account to Improve Emergency Medical Transportation
Quality and Access; prescribing the authorized uses of the revenue
generated by the assessment; requiring the Division to adopt
regulations establishing administrative penalties; authorizing the
Division to collect an unpaid assessment or administrative penalty;
authorizing certain health authorities to impose administrative penalties
or take other disciplinary actions in certain circumstances; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the Division of Health Care Financing and Policy of the
2 Department of Health and Human Services to impose, in certain circumstances, an assessment
3 on agencies to provide personal care services in the home or medical facilities that are
4 required to obtain a certain type of license. (NRS 422.3794) Existing law requires the Division
5 to expend the revenue generated from the assessment to: (1) provide supplemental payments
6 and enhanced rates of reimbursement to operators of agencies to provide personal care
7 services in the home and operators of medical facilities for services rendered to recipients of
8 Medicaid; (2) fund certain additional supports and services under Medicaid; and (3) pay
9 administrative costs. (NRS 422.37945) Sections 2-9 of this bill require the imposition of a
10 similar assessment on private emergency medical transport providers. Section 6 requires: (1)
11 the percentage of the assessment to be based on a percentage of net revenue earned by the
12 private emergency medical transport service from providing services in this State; and (2) the
13 Division to set the amount of the percentage of the assessment by regulation, subject to certain
14 requirements.
15 Section 7 creates the Account to Improve Emergency Medical Transportation Quality and
16 Access. Section 7 requires the Division to administer the Account and to deposit the proceeds
17 collected from the assessment into the Account. Section 7 provides that money in the Account
18 may only be expended to: (1) provide enhanced rates of reimbursement under Medicaid to
19 private emergency medical transport providers for providing emergency ambulance services
20 to recipients of Medicaid; (2) fund certain data infrastructure improvements and educational
Senate Amendment No. 467 to Senate Bill No. 424 Page 4
21 and community outreach initiatives undertaken by the Department; and (3) pay administrative
22 costs related to the assessment. If the Legislature authorizes the money in the Account to be
23 used for any other purpose, section 7: (1) requires that the Division cease imposing the
24 assessment; and (2) provides that the regulations adopted to impose the assessment are void.
25 Section 8 requires the Division to adopt regulations establishing administrative penalties
26 against a private emergency medical transport provider that fails to pay an assessment in a
27 timely manner. Section 8 authorizes the Division, after notifying the provider, to: (1) deduct
28 the amount of an unpaid assessment or administrative penalty from future payments owed to
29 the private emergency medical transport provider under Medicaid; and (2) negotiate a
30 payment plan with a delinquent private emergency medical transport provider before making
31 such deductions. Section 8 also requires the Division to notify the health authority that issued
32 a private emergency medical transport provider a permit to own or operate an ambulance [or
33 air ambulance] in this State if the provider has failed to pay an assessment or administrative
34 penalty in a timely manner. Section 11 of this bill authorizes the applicable health authority
35 to, after receiving such a notification from the Division, take certain disciplinary actions
36 against the private emergency medical transport provider.
37 Section 9 authorizes the Division to modify the amount of the assessment, the enhanced
38 rates of reimbursement or any other requirement established by sections 2-9 as necessary to
39 receive federal financial participation to carry out the provisions of sections 2-9. Section 9
40 also requires the suspension of the assessment and the payment of enhanced rates of
41 reimbursement upon the occurrence of certain events. Section 9 requires the retroactive
42 reimposition of such assessments and payments when the event triggering the suspension is no
43 longer applicable.
44 Sections [3, 4 and 5] 3-5 define certain terms and section 2 establishes the applicability
45 of those definitions. Section 10 of this bill requires the Director of the Department to
46 administer the provisions of sections 2-9 in the same manner as other provisions relating to
47 Medicaid.

SUMMARY—Requires an assessment to be imposed on private emergency
medical transport providers. (BDR 38-561)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; requiring the Division of Health Care Financing
and Policy of the Department of Health and Human Services to impose
an assessment on private emergency medical transport providers;
creating the Account to Improve Emergency Medical Transportation
Quality and Access; prescribing the authorized uses of the revenue
generated by the assessment; requiring the Division to adopt
regulations establishing administrative penalties; authorizing the
Division to collect an unpaid assessment or administrative penalty;
authorizing certain health authorities to impose administrative penalties
or take other disciplinary actions in certain circumstances; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the Division of Health Care Financing and Policy of the
2 Department of Health and Human Services to impose, in certain circumstances, an assessment
3 on agencies to provide personal care services in the home or medical facilities that are
4 required to obtain a certain type of license. (NRS 422.3794) Existing law requires the Division
5 to expend the revenue generated from the assessment to: (1) provide supplemental payments
6 and enhanced rates of reimbursement to operators of agencies to provide personal care
7 services in the home and operators of medical facilities for services rendered to recipients of
8 Medicaid; (2) fund certain additional supports and services under Medicaid; and (3) pay
9 administrative costs. (NRS 422.37945) Sections 2-9 of this bill require the imposition of a
10 similar assessment on private emergency medical transport providers. Section 6 requires: (1)
11 the percentage of the assessment to be based on a percentage of net revenue earned by the
12 private emergency medical transport service from providing services in this State; and (2) the
13 Division to set the amount of the percentage of the assessment by regulation, subject to certain
14 requirements.
15 Section 7 creates the Account to Improve Emergency Medical Transportation Quality and
16 Access. Section 7 requires the Division to administer the Account and to deposit the proceeds
17 collected from the assessment into the Account. Section 7 provides that money in the Account
18 may only be expended to: (1) provide enhanced rates of reimbursement under Medicaid to
19 private emergency medical transport providers for providing emergency ambulance services
20 to recipients of Medicaid; (2) fund certain data infrastructure improvements and educational

Senate Amendment No. 467 to Senate Bill No. 424 Page 4
21 and community outreach initiatives undertaken by the Department; and (3) pay administrative
22 costs related to the assessment. If the Legislature authorizes the money in the Account to be
23 used for any other purpose, section 7: (1) requires that the Division cease imposing the
24 assessment; and (2) provides that the regulations adopted to impose the assessment are void.
25 Section 8 requires the Division to adopt regulations establishing administrative penalties
26 against a private emergency medical transport provider that fails to pay an assessment in a
27 timely manner. Section 8 authorizes the Division, after notifying the provider, to: (1) deduct
28 the amount of an unpaid assessment or administrative penalty from future payments owed to
29 the private emergency medical transport provider under Medicaid; and (2) negotiate a
30 payment plan with a delinquent private emergency medical transport provider before making
31 such deductions. Section 8 also requires the Division to notify the health authority that issued
32 a private emergency medical transport provider a permit to own or operate an ambulance [or
33 air ambulance] in this State if the provider has failed to pay an assessment or administrative
34 penalty in a timely manner. Section 11 of this bill authorizes the applicable health authority
35 to, after receiving such a notification from the Division, take certain disciplinary actions
36 against the private emergency medical transport provider.
37 Section 9 authorizes the Division to modify the amount of the assessment, the enhanced
38 rates of reimbursement or any other requirement established by sections 2-9 as necessary to
39 receive federal financial participation to carry out the provisions of sections 2-9. Section 9
40 also requires the suspension of the assessment and the payment of enhanced rates of
41 reimbursement upon the occurrence of certain events. Section 9 requires the retroactive
42 reimposition of such assessments and payments when the event triggering the suspension is no
43 longer applicable.
44 Sections [3, 4 and 5] 3-5 define certain terms and section 2 establishes the applicability
45 of those definitions. Section 10 of this bill requires the Director of the Department to
46 administer the provisions of sections 2-9 in the same manner as other provisions relating to
47 Medicaid.
