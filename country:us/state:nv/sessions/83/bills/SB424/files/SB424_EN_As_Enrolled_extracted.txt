Health and Human Services
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to emergency medical services; requiring the
Division of Health Care Financing and Policy of the
Department of Health and Human Services to impose an
assessment on private emergency medical transport
providers; creating the Account to Improve Emergency
Medical Transportation Quality and Access; prescribing the
authorized uses of the revenue generated by the assessment;
requiring the Division to adopt regulations establishing
administrative penalties; authorizing the Division to collect
an unpaid assessment or administrative penalty; authorizing
certain health authorities to impose administrative penalties
or take other disciplinary actions in certain circumstances;
authorizing a health authority to establish a training program
relating to human trafficking; establishing requirements for
such a training program; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law authorizes the Division of Health Care Financing and Policy of the
Department of Health and Human Services to impose, in certain circumstances, an
assessment on agencies to provide personal care services in the home or medical
facilities that are required to obtain a certain type of license. (NRS 422.3794)
Existing law requires the Division to expend the revenue generated from the
assessment to: (1) provide supplemental payments and enhanced rates of
reimbursement to operators of agencies to provide personal care services in the
home and operators of medical facilities for services rendered to recipients of
Medicaid; (2) fund certain additional supports and services under Medicaid; and (3)
pay administrative costs. (NRS 422.37945) Sections 2-9 of this bill require the
imposition of a similar assessment on private emergency medical transport
providers. Section 6 requires: (1) the percentage of the assessment to be based on a
percentage of net revenue earned by the private emergency medical transport
provider from providing services in this State; and (2) the Division to set the
amount of the percentage of the assessment by regulation, subject to certain
requirements.

Section 2:
Section 7 creates the Account to Improve Emergency Medical Transportation
Quality and Access. Section 7 requires the Division to administer the Account and
to deposit the proceeds collected from the assessment into the Account. Section 7
provides that money in the Account may only be expended to: (1) provide enhanced
rates of reimbursement under Medicaid to private emergency medical transport
providers for providing emergency ambulance services to recipients of Medicaid;
(2) fund certain data infrastructure improvements and educational and community
outreach initiatives undertaken by the Department; and (3) pay administrative costs
related to the assessment. If the Legislature authorizes the money in the Account to
be used for any other purpose, section 7: (1) requires that the Division cease
imposing the assessment; and (2) provides that the regulations adopted to impose
the assessment are void.

Section 3:
Section 8 requires the Division to adopt regulations establishing administrative
penalties against a private emergency medical transport provider that fails to pay an
assessment in a timely manner. Section 8 authorizes the Division, after notifying
the provider, to: (1) deduct the amount of an unpaid assessment or administrative
penalty from future payments owed to the private emergency medical transport
provider under Medicaid; and (2) negotiate a payment plan with a delinquent
private emergency medical transport provider before making such deductions.

Section 4:
Section 8 also requires the Division to notify the health authority that issued a
private emergency medical transport provider a permit to own or operate an
ambulance in this State if the provider has failed to pay an assessment or
administrative penalty in a timely manner. Section 11 of this bill authorizes the
applicable health authority to, after receiving such a notification from the Division,
take certain disciplinary actions against the private emergency medical transport
provider.

Section 5:
Section 9 authorizes the Division to modify the amount of the assessment, the
enhanced rates of reimbursement or any other requirement established by sections
2-9 as necessary to receive federal financial participation to carry out the provisions
of sections 2-9. Section 9 also requires the suspension of the assessment and the
payment of enhanced rates of reimbursement upon the occurrence of certain events.

Section 6:
Section 9 requires the retroactive reimposition of such assessments and payments
when the event triggering the suspension is no longer applicable.

Section 7:
Sections 3-5 define certain terms and section 2 establishes the applicability of
those definitions. Section 10 of this bill requires the Director of the Department to
administer the provisions of sections 2-9 in the same manner as other provisions
relating to Medicaid.
Existing law authorizes a health authority to operate a training program in
emergency first aid, emergency care and other techniques associated with
emergency care for the benefit of certain professionals who may respond to
emergencies as a part of their job duties, including ambulance attendants and
firefighters. (NRS 450B.850) Section 11.5 of this bill authorizes a health authority
to establish a separate training program which is focused on identifying and
responding to victims of human trafficking.

Raw Text:
Senate Bill No. 424–Committee on
Health and Human Services
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to emergency medical services; requiring the
Division of Health Care Financing and Policy of the
Department of Health and Human Services to impose an
assessment on private emergency medical transport
providers; creating the Account to Improve Emergency
Medical Transportation Quality and Access; prescribing the
authorized uses of the revenue generated by the assessment;
requiring the Division to adopt regulations establishing
administrative penalties; authorizing the Division to collect
an unpaid assessment or administrative penalty; authorizing
certain health authorities to impose administrative penalties
or take other disciplinary actions in certain circumstances;
authorizing a health authority to establish a training program
relating to human trafficking; establishing requirements for
such a training program; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law authorizes the Division of Health Care Financing and Policy of the
Department of Health and Human Services to impose, in certain circumstances, an
assessment on agencies to provide personal care services in the home or medical
facilities that are required to obtain a certain type of license. (NRS 422.3794)
Existing law requires the Division to expend the revenue generated from the
assessment to: (1) provide supplemental payments and enhanced rates of
reimbursement to operators of agencies to provide personal care services in the
home and operators of medical facilities for services rendered to recipients of
Medicaid; (2) fund certain additional supports and services under Medicaid; and (3)
pay administrative costs. (NRS 422.37945) Sections 2-9 of this bill require the
imposition of a similar assessment on private emergency medical transport
providers. Section 6 requires: (1) the percentage of the assessment to be based on a
percentage of net revenue earned by the private emergency medical transport
provider from providing services in this State; and (2) the Division to set the
amount of the percentage of the assessment by regulation, subject to certain
requirements.
Section 7 creates the Account to Improve Emergency Medical Transportation
Quality and Access. Section 7 requires the Division to administer the Account and
to deposit the proceeds collected from the assessment into the Account. Section 7
provides that money in the Account may only be expended to: (1) provide enhanced
rates of reimbursement under Medicaid to private emergency medical transport
providers for providing emergency ambulance services to recipients of Medicaid;
(2) fund certain data infrastructure improvements and educational and community
outreach initiatives undertaken by the Department; and (3) pay administrative costs
related to the assessment. If the Legislature authorizes the money in the Account to
be used for any other purpose, section 7: (1) requires that the Division cease
imposing the assessment; and (2) provides that the regulations adopted to impose
the assessment are void.
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 2 –
Section 8 requires the Division to adopt regulations establishing administrative
penalties against a private emergency medical transport provider that fails to pay an
assessment in a timely manner. Section 8 authorizes the Division, after notifying
the provider, to: (1) deduct the amount of an unpaid assessment or administrative
penalty from future payments owed to the private emergency medical transport
provider under Medicaid; and (2) negotiate a payment plan with a delinquent
private emergency medical transport provider before making such deductions.
Section 8 also requires the Division to notify the health authority that issued a
private emergency medical transport provider a permit to own or operate an
ambulance in this State if the provider has failed to pay an assessment or
administrative penalty in a timely manner. Section 11 of this bill authorizes the
applicable health authority to, after receiving such a notification from the Division,
take certain disciplinary actions against the private emergency medical transport
provider.
Section 9 authorizes the Division to modify the amount of the assessment, the
enhanced rates of reimbursement or any other requirement established by sections
2-9 as necessary to receive federal financial participation to carry out the provisions
of sections 2-9. Section 9 also requires the suspension of the assessment and the
payment of enhanced rates of reimbursement upon the occurrence of certain events.
Section 9 requires the retroactive reimposition of such assessments and payments
when the event triggering the suspension is no longer applicable.
Sections 3-5 define certain terms and section 2 establishes the applicability of
those definitions. Section 10 of this bill requires the Director of the Department to
administer the provisions of sections 2-9 in the same manner as other provisions
relating to Medicaid.
Existing law authorizes a health authority to operate a training program in
emergency first aid, emergency care and other techniques associated with
emergency care for the benefit of certain professionals who may respond to
emergencies as a part of their job duties, including ambulance attendants and
firefighters. (NRS 450B.850) Section 11.5 of this bill authorizes a health authority
to establish a separate training program which is focused on identifying and
responding to victims of human trafficking.
