AN ACT relating to emergency medical services; requiring the
Division of Health Care Financing and Policy of the
Department of Health and Human Services to impose an
assessment on private emergency medical transport
providers; creating the Account to Improve Emergency
Medical Transportation Quality and Access; prescribing
the authorized uses of the revenue generated by the
assessment; requiring the Division to adopt regulations
establishing administrative penalties; authorizing the
Division to collect an unpaid assessment or administrative
penalty; authorizing certain health authorities to impose
administrative penalties or take other disciplinary actions
in certain circumstances; authorizing a health authority to
establish a training program relating to human trafficking;
establishing requirements for such a training program;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the Division of Health Care Financing and Policy of the
2 Department of Health and Human Services to impose, in certain circumstances, an
3 assessment on agencies to provide personal care services in the home or medical
4 facilities that are required to obtain a certain type of license. (NRS 422.3794)
5 Existing law requires the Division to expend the revenue generated from the
6 assessment to: (1) provide supplemental payments and enhanced rates of
7 reimbursement to operators of agencies to provide personal care services in the
8 home and operators of medical facilities for services rendered to recipients of
9 Medicaid; (2) fund certain additional supports and services under Medicaid; and (3)

– 2 –
10 pay administrative costs. (NRS 422.37945) Sections 2-9 of this bill require the
11 imposition of a similar assessment on private emergency medical transport
12 providers. Section 6 requires: (1) the percentage of the assessment to be based on a
13 percentage of net revenue earned by the private emergency medical transport
14 provider from providing services in this State; and (2) the Division to set the
15 amount of the percentage of the assessment by regulation, subject to certain
16 requirements.
17 Section 7 creates the Account to Improve Emergency Medical Transportation
18 Quality and Access. Section 7 requires the Division to administer the Account and
19 to deposit the proceeds collected from the assessment into the Account. Section 7
20 provides that money in the Account may only be expended to: (1) provide enhanced
21 rates of reimbursement under Medicaid to private emergency medical transport
22 providers for providing emergency ambulance services to recipients of Medicaid;
23 (2) fund certain data infrastructure improvements and educational and community
24 outreach initiatives undertaken by the Department; and (3) pay administrative costs
25 related to the assessment. If the Legislature authorizes the money in the Account to
26 be used for any other purpose, section 7: (1) requires that the Division cease
27 imposing the assessment; and (2) provides that the regulations adopted to impose
28 the assessment are void.
29 Section 8 requires the Division to adopt regulations establishing administrative
30 penalties against a private emergency medical transport provider that fails to pay an
31 assessment in a timely manner. Section 8 authorizes the Division, after notifying
32 the provider, to: (1) deduct the amount of an unpaid assessment or administrative
33 penalty from future payments owed to the private emergency medical transport
34 provider under Medicaid; and (2) negotiate a payment plan with a delinquent
35 private emergency medical transport provider before making such deductions.
36 Section 8 also requires the Division to notify the health authority that issued a
37 private emergency medical transport provider a permit to own or operate an
38 ambulance in this State if the provider has failed to pay an assessment or
39 administrative penalty in a timely manner. Section 11 of this bill authorizes the
40 applicable health authority to, after receiving such a notification from the Division,
41 take certain disciplinary actions against the private emergency medical transport
42 provider.
43 Section 9 authorizes the Division to modify the amount of the assessment, the
44 enhanced rates of reimbursement or any other requirement established by sections
45 2-9 as necessary to receive federal financial participation to carry out the provisions
46 of sections 2-9. Section 9 also requires the suspension of the assessment and the
47 payment of enhanced rates of reimbursement upon the occurrence of certain events.
48 Section 9 requires the retroactive reimposition of such assessments and payments
49 when the event triggering the suspension is no longer applicable.
50 Sections 3-5 define certain terms and section 2 establishes the applicability of
51 those definitions. Section 10 of this bill requires the Director of the Department to
52 administer the provisions of sections 2-9 in the same manner as other provisions
53 relating to Medicaid.
54 Existing law authorizes a health authority to operate a training program in
55 emergency first aid, emergency care and other techniques associated with
56 emergency care for the benefit of certain professionals who may respond to
57 emergencies as a part of their job duties, including ambulance attendants and
58 firefighters. (NRS 450B.850) Section 11.5 of this bill authorizes a health authority
59 to establish a separate training program which is focused on identifying and
60 responding to victims of human trafficking.
