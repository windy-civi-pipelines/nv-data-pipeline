EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to [health care;] emergency medical services; requiring the
Division of Health Care Financing and Policy of the Department of
Health and Human Services to impose an assessment on private
emergency medical transport providers; creating the Account to
Improve Emergency Medical Transportation Quality and Access;
prescribing the authorized uses of the revenue generated by the
assessment; requiring the Division to adopt regulations establishing
administrative penalties; authorizing the Division to collect an unpaid
assessment or administrative penalty; authorizing certain health
authorities to impose administrative penalties or take other disciplinary
actions in certain circumstances; authorizing a health authority to
establish a training program relating to human trafficking;
establishing requirements for such a training program; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the Division of Health Care Financing and Policy of the
2 Department of Health and Human Services to impose, in certain circumstances, an assessment
3 on agencies to provide personal care services in the home or medical facilities that are
4 required to obtain a certain type of license. (NRS 422.3794) Existing law requires the Division
5 to expend the revenue generated from the assessment to: (1) provide supplemental payments
6 and enhanced rates of reimbursement to operators of agencies to provide personal care
7 services in the home and operators of medical facilities for services rendered to recipients of
8 Medicaid; (2) fund certain additional supports and services under Medicaid; and (3) pay
9 administrative costs. (NRS 422.37945) Sections 2-9 of this bill require the imposition of a
10 similar assessment on private emergency medical transport providers. Section 6 requires: (1)
11 the percentage of the assessment to be based on a percentage of net revenue earned by the
12 private emergency medical transport [service] provider from providing services in this State;
13 and (2) the Division to set the amount of the percentage of the assessment by regulation,
14 subject to certain requirements.
Senate Amendment No. 759 to Senate Bill No. 424 First Reprint Page 4
15 Section 7 creates the Account to Improve Emergency Medical Transportation Quality and
16 Access. Section 7 requires the Division to administer the Account and to deposit the proceeds
17 collected from the assessment into the Account. Section 7 provides that money in the Account
18 may only be expended to: (1) provide enhanced rates of reimbursement under Medicaid to
19 private emergency medical transport providers for providing emergency ambulance services
20 to recipients of Medicaid; (2) fund certain data infrastructure improvements and educational
21 and community outreach initiatives undertaken by the Department; and (3) pay administrative
22 costs related to the assessment. If the Legislature authorizes the money in the Account to be
23 used for any other purpose, section 7: (1) requires that the Division cease imposing the
24 assessment; and (2) provides that the regulations adopted to impose the assessment are void.
25 Section 8 requires the Division to adopt regulations establishing administrative penalties
26 against a private emergency medical transport provider that fails to pay an assessment in a
27 timely manner. Section 8 authorizes the Division, after notifying the provider, to: (1) deduct
28 the amount of an unpaid assessment or administrative penalty from future payments owed to
29 the private emergency medical transport provider under Medicaid; and (2) negotiate a
30 payment plan with a delinquent private emergency medical transport provider before making
31 such deductions. Section 8 also requires the Division to notify the health authority that issued
32 a private emergency medical transport provider a permit to own or operate an ambulance in
33 this State if the provider has failed to pay an assessment or administrative penalty in a timely
34 manner. Section 11 of this bill authorizes the applicable health authority to, after receiving
35 such a notification from the Division, take certain disciplinary actions against the private
36 emergency medical transport provider.
37 Section 9 authorizes the Division to modify the amount of the assessment, the enhanced
38 rates of reimbursement or any other requirement established by sections 2-9 as necessary to
39 receive federal financial participation to carry out the provisions of sections 2-9. Section 9
40 also requires the suspension of the assessment and the payment of enhanced rates of
41 reimbursement upon the occurrence of certain events. Section 9 requires the retroactive
42 reimposition of such assessments and payments when the event triggering the suspension is no
43 longer applicable.
44 Sections 3-5 define certain terms and section 2 establishes the applicability of those
45 definitions. Section 10 of this bill requires the Director of the Department to administer the
46 provisions of sections 2-9 in the same manner as other provisions relating to Medicaid.
47 Existing law authorizes a health authority to operate a training program in
48 emergency first aid, emergency care and other techniques associated with emergency
49 care for the benefit of certain professionals who may respond to emergencies as a part of
50 their job duties, including ambulance attendants and firefighters. (NRS 450B.850)
51 Section 11.5 of this bill authorizes a health authority to establish a separate training
52 program which is focused on identifying and responding to victims of human trafficking.

Referred to Committee on Health and Human Services
SUMMARY—[Requires an assessment to be imposed on private emergency
medical transport providers.] Revises provisions relating to
emergency medical services. (BDR 38-561)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to [health care;] emergency medical services; requiring the
Division of Health Care Financing and Policy of the Department of
Health and Human Services to impose an assessment on private
emergency medical transport providers; creating the Account to
Improve Emergency Medical Transportation Quality and Access;
prescribing the authorized uses of the revenue generated by the
assessment; requiring the Division to adopt regulations establishing
administrative penalties; authorizing the Division to collect an unpaid
assessment or administrative penalty; authorizing certain health
authorities to impose administrative penalties or take other disciplinary
actions in certain circumstances; authorizing a health authority to
establish a training program relating to human trafficking;
establishing requirements for such a training program; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the Division of Health Care Financing and Policy of the
2 Department of Health and Human Services to impose, in certain circumstances, an assessment
3 on agencies to provide personal care services in the home or medical facilities that are
4 required to obtain a certain type of license. (NRS 422.3794) Existing law requires the Division
5 to expend the revenue generated from the assessment to: (1) provide supplemental payments
6 and enhanced rates of reimbursement to operators of agencies to provide personal care
7 services in the home and operators of medical facilities for services rendered to recipients of
8 Medicaid; (2) fund certain additional supports and services under Medicaid; and (3) pay
9 administrative costs. (NRS 422.37945) Sections 2-9 of this bill require the imposition of a
10 similar assessment on private emergency medical transport providers. Section 6 requires: (1)
11 the percentage of the assessment to be based on a percentage of net revenue earned by the
12 private emergency medical transport [service] provider from providing services in this State;
13 and (2) the Division to set the amount of the percentage of the assessment by regulation,
14 subject to certain requirements.

Senate Amendment No. 759 to Senate Bill No. 424 First Reprint Page 4
15 Section 7 creates the Account to Improve Emergency Medical Transportation Quality and
16 Access. Section 7 requires the Division to administer the Account and to deposit the proceeds
17 collected from the assessment into the Account. Section 7 provides that money in the Account
18 may only be expended to: (1) provide enhanced rates of reimbursement under Medicaid to
19 private emergency medical transport providers for providing emergency ambulance services
20 to recipients of Medicaid; (2) fund certain data infrastructure improvements and educational
21 and community outreach initiatives undertaken by the Department; and (3) pay administrative
22 costs related to the assessment. If the Legislature authorizes the money in the Account to be
23 used for any other purpose, section 7: (1) requires that the Division cease imposing the
24 assessment; and (2) provides that the regulations adopted to impose the assessment are void.
25 Section 8 requires the Division to adopt regulations establishing administrative penalties
26 against a private emergency medical transport provider that fails to pay an assessment in a
27 timely manner. Section 8 authorizes the Division, after notifying the provider, to: (1) deduct
28 the amount of an unpaid assessment or administrative penalty from future payments owed to
29 the private emergency medical transport provider under Medicaid; and (2) negotiate a
30 payment plan with a delinquent private emergency medical transport provider before making
31 such deductions. Section 8 also requires the Division to notify the health authority that issued
32 a private emergency medical transport provider a permit to own or operate an ambulance in
33 this State if the provider has failed to pay an assessment or administrative penalty in a timely
34 manner. Section 11 of this bill authorizes the applicable health authority to, after receiving
35 such a notification from the Division, take certain disciplinary actions against the private
36 emergency medical transport provider.
37 Section 9 authorizes the Division to modify the amount of the assessment, the enhanced
38 rates of reimbursement or any other requirement established by sections 2-9 as necessary to
39 receive federal financial participation to carry out the provisions of sections 2-9. Section 9
40 also requires the suspension of the assessment and the payment of enhanced rates of
41 reimbursement upon the occurrence of certain events. Section 9 requires the retroactive
42 reimposition of such assessments and payments when the event triggering the suspension is no
43 longer applicable.
44 Sections 3-5 define certain terms and section 2 establishes the applicability of those
45 definitions. Section 10 of this bill requires the Director of the Department to administer the
46 provisions of sections 2-9 in the same manner as other provisions relating to Medicaid.
47 Existing law authorizes a health authority to operate a training program in
48 emergency first aid, emergency care and other techniques associated with emergency
49 care for the benefit of certain professionals who may respond to emergencies as a part of
50 their job duties, including ambulance attendants and firefighters. (NRS 450B.850)
51 Section 11.5 of this bill authorizes a health authority to establish a separate training
52 program which is focused on identifying and responding to victims of human trafficking.

40 pursuant to section 6 of this act, the amount of any enhanced rate of
41 reimbursement described in paragraph (a) of subsection 3 of section 7 of this act
42 or any other requirement or formula established pursuant to sections 2 to 9,
43 inclusive, of this act to the extent necessary to obtain federal financial
44 participation for the enhanced rates of reimbursement described in paragraph (a)
45 of subsection 3 of section 7 of this act. Such modifications must not result in the
46 collection of assessments in an amount greater than is required for the purposes
47 prescribed by subsection 3 of section 7 of this act.
48 2. The Division shall take the actions described in subsection 3 after
49 determining that:
50 (a) The amount of funding available for the reimbursement of private

11 Division shall:
12 (a) Immediately cease imposing and collecting the assessment otherwise
13 required to be imposed pursuant to section 6 of this act;
14 (b) Immediately cease using the money generated through that assessment
15 for the purposes described in subsection 3 of section 7 of this act; and
16 (c) Return any money collected through the assessment imposed pursuant to
17 section 6 of this act that the Division is prohibited by paragraph (b) from using
18 for the purposes described in subsection 3 of section 7 of this act to the private
19 emergency medical transport provider from whom it was collected.
20 4. If the Division, after suspending the collection of assessments and the
21 payment of enhanced rates of reimbursement pursuant to subsection 3,
22 determines that the provisions of subsection 2 no longer apply, the Division shall:
23 (a) Resume collecting assessments pursuant to section 6 of this act;
