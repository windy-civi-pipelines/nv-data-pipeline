EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; requiring the Division of Health
Care Financing and Policy of the Department of Health
and Human Services to impose an assessment on private
emergency medical transport providers; creating the
Account to Improve Emergency Medical Transportation
Quality and Access; prescribing the authorized uses of the
revenue generated by the assessment; requiring the
Division to adopt regulations establishing administrative
penalties; authorizing the Division to collect an unpaid
assessment or administrative penalty; authorizing certain
health authorities to impose administrative penalties or
take other disciplinary actions in certain circumstances;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the Division of Health Care Financing and Policy of the
2 Department of Health and Human Services to impose, in certain circumstances, an
3 assessment on agencies to provide personal care services in the home or medical
4 facilities that are required to obtain a certain type of license. (NRS 422.3794)
5 Existing law requires the Division to expend the revenue generated from the
6 assessment to: (1) provide supplemental payments and enhanced rates of
7 reimbursement to operators of agencies to provide personal care services in the
8 home and operators of medical facilities for services rendered to recipients of
9 Medicaid; (2) fund certain additional supports and services under Medicaid; and (3)
10 pay administrative costs. (NRS 422.37945) Sections 2-9 of this bill require the
11 imposition of a similar assessment on private emergency medical transport
12 providers. Section 6 requires: (1) the percentage of the assessment to be based on a
-
*SB424*
– 2 –
13 percentage of net revenue earned by the private emergency medical transport
14 service from providing services in this State; and (2) the Division to set the amount
15 of the percentage of the assessment by regulation, subject to certain requirements.
16 Section 7 creates the Account to Improve Emergency Medical Transportation
17 Quality and Access. Section 7 requires the Division to administer the Account and
18 to deposit the proceeds collected from the assessment into the Account. Section 7
19 provides that money in the Account may only be expended to: (1) provide enhanced
20 rates of reimbursement under Medicaid to private emergency medical transport
21 providers for providing emergency ambulance services to recipients of Medicaid;
22 (2) fund certain data infrastructure improvements and educational and community
23 outreach initiatives undertaken by the Department; and (3) pay administrative costs
24 related to the assessment. If the Legislature authorizes the money in the Account to
25 be used for any other purpose, section 7: (1) requires that the Division cease
26 imposing the assessment; and (2) provides that the regulations adopted to impose
27 the assessment are void.
28 Section 8 requires the Division to adopt regulations establishing administrative
29 penalties against a private emergency medical transport provider that fails to pay an
30 assessment in a timely manner. Section 8 authorizes the Division, after notifying
31 the provider, to: (1) deduct the amount of an unpaid assessment or administrative
32 penalty from future payments owed to the private emergency transport provider
33 under Medicaid; and (2) negotiate a payment plan with a delinquent private
34 emergency medical transport provider before making such deductions. Section 8
35 also requires the Division to notify the health authority that issued a private
36 emergency medical transport provider a permit to own or operate an ambulance or
37 air ambulance in this State if the provider has failed to pay an assessment or
38 administrative penalty in a timely manner. Section 11 of this bill authorizes the
39 applicable health authority to, after receiving such a notification from the Division,
40 take certain disciplinary actions against the private emergency medical transport
41 provider.
42 Section 9 authorizes the Division to modify the amount of the assessment, the
43 enhanced rates of reimbursement or any other requirement established by sections
44 2-9 as necessary to receive federal financial participation to carry out the provisions
45 of sections 2-9. Section 9 also requires the suspension of the assessment and the
46 payment of enhanced rates of reimbursement upon the occurrence of certain events.
47 Section 9 requires the retroactive reimposition of such assessments and payments
48 when the event triggering the suspension is no longer applicable.
49 Sections 3, 4 and 5 define certain terms and section 2 establishes the
50 applicability of those definitions. Section 10 of this bill requires the Director of the
51 Department to administer the provisions of sections 2-9 in the same manner as
52 other provisions relating to Medicaid.

SENATE BILL NO. 424–COMMITTEE ON
HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES
MARCH 24, 2025

SUMMARY—Requires an assessment to be imposed on private
emergency medical transport providers.
(BDR 38-561)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; requiring the Division of Health
Care Financing and Policy of the Department of Health
and Human Services to impose an assessment on private
emergency medical transport providers; creating the
Account to Improve Emergency Medical Transportation
Quality and Access; prescribing the authorized uses of the
revenue generated by the assessment; requiring the
Division to adopt regulations establishing administrative
penalties; authorizing the Division to collect an unpaid
assessment or administrative penalty; authorizing certain
health authorities to impose administrative penalties or
take other disciplinary actions in certain circumstances;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the Division of Health Care Financing and Policy of the
2 Department of Health and Human Services to impose, in certain circumstances, an
3 assessment on agencies to provide personal care services in the home or medical
4 facilities that are required to obtain a certain type of license. (NRS 422.3794)
5 Existing law requires the Division to expend the revenue generated from the
6 assessment to: (1) provide supplemental payments and enhanced rates of
7 reimbursement to operators of agencies to provide personal care services in the
8 home and operators of medical facilities for services rendered to recipients of
9 Medicaid; (2) fund certain additional supports and services under Medicaid; and (3)
10 pay administrative costs. (NRS 422.37945) Sections 2-9 of this bill require the
11 imposition of a similar assessment on private emergency medical transport
12 providers. Section 6 requires: (1) the percentage of the assessment to be based on a
-
*SB424*

– 2 –
13 percentage of net revenue earned by the private emergency medical transport
14 service from providing services in this State; and (2) the Division to set the amount
15 of the percentage of the assessment by regulation, subject to certain requirements.
16 Section 7 creates the Account to Improve Emergency Medical Transportation
17 Quality and Access. Section 7 requires the Division to administer the Account and
18 to deposit the proceeds collected from the assessment into the Account. Section 7
19 provides that money in the Account may only be expended to: (1) provide enhanced
20 rates of reimbursement under Medicaid to private emergency medical transport
21 providers for providing emergency ambulance services to recipients of Medicaid;
22 (2) fund certain data infrastructure improvements and educational and community
23 outreach initiatives undertaken by the Department; and (3) pay administrative costs
24 related to the assessment. If the Legislature authorizes the money in the Account to
25 be used for any other purpose, section 7: (1) requires that the Division cease
26 imposing the assessment; and (2) provides that the regulations adopted to impose
27 the assessment are void.
28 Section 8 requires the Division to adopt regulations establishing administrative
29 penalties against a private emergency medical transport provider that fails to pay an
30 assessment in a timely manner. Section 8 authorizes the Division, after notifying
31 the provider, to: (1) deduct the amount of an unpaid assessment or administrative
32 penalty from future payments owed to the private emergency transport provider
33 under Medicaid; and (2) negotiate a payment plan with a delinquent private
34 emergency medical transport provider before making such deductions. Section 8
35 also requires the Division to notify the health authority that issued a private
36 emergency medical transport provider a permit to own or operate an ambulance or
37 air ambulance in this State if the provider has failed to pay an assessment or
38 administrative penalty in a timely manner. Section 11 of this bill authorizes the
39 applicable health authority to, after receiving such a notification from the Division,
40 take certain disciplinary actions against the private emergency medical transport
41 provider.
42 Section 9 authorizes the Division to modify the amount of the assessment, the
43 enhanced rates of reimbursement or any other requirement established by sections
44 2-9 as necessary to receive federal financial participation to carry out the provisions
45 of sections 2-9. Section 9 also requires the suspension of the assessment and the
46 payment of enhanced rates of reimbursement upon the occurrence of certain events.
47 Section 9 requires the retroactive reimposition of such assessments and payments
48 when the event triggering the suspension is no longer applicable.
49 Sections 3, 4 and 5 define certain terms and section 2 establishes the
50 applicability of those definitions. Section 10 of this bill requires the Director of the
51 Department to administer the provisions of sections 2-9 in the same manner as
52 other provisions relating to Medicaid.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
