EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; requiring the Division of Health
Care Financing and Policy of the Department of Health
and Human Services to impose an assessment on private
emergency medical transport providers; creating the
Account to Improve Emergency Medical Transportation
Quality and Access; prescribing the authorized uses of the
revenue generated by the assessment; requiring the
Division to adopt regulations establishing administrative
penalties; authorizing the Division to collect an unpaid
assessment or administrative penalty; authorizing certain
health authorities to impose administrative penalties or
take other disciplinary actions in certain circumstances;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the Division of Health Care Financing and Policy of the
2 Department of Health and Human Services to impose, in certain circumstances, an
3 assessment on agencies to provide personal care services in the home or medical
4 facilities that are required to obtain a certain type of license. (NRS 422.3794)
5 Existing law requires the Division to expend the revenue generated from the
6 assessment to: (1) provide supplemental payments and enhanced rates of
7 reimbursement to operators of agencies to provide personal care services in the
8 home and operators of medical facilities for services rendered to recipients of
9 Medicaid; (2) fund certain additional supports and services under Medicaid; and (3)
10 pay administrative costs. (NRS 422.37945) Sections 2-9 of this bill require the
11 imposition of a similar assessment on private emergency medical transport
12 providers. Section 6 requires: (1) the percentage of the assessment to be based on a
-
*SB424_R1*

– 2 –
13 percentage of net revenue earned by the private emergency medical transport
14 service from providing services in this State; and (2) the Division to set the amount
15 of the percentage of the assessment by regulation, subject to certain requirements.
16 Section 7 creates the Account to Improve Emergency Medical Transportation
17 Quality and Access. Section 7 requires the Division to administer the Account and
18 to deposit the proceeds collected from the assessment into the Account. Section 7
19 provides that money in the Account may only be expended to: (1) provide enhanced
20 rates of reimbursement under Medicaid to private emergency medical transport
21 providers for providing emergency ambulance services to recipients of Medicaid;
22 (2) fund certain data infrastructure improvements and educational and community
23 outreach initiatives undertaken by the Department; and (3) pay administrative costs
24 related to the assessment. If the Legislature authorizes the money in the Account to
25 be used for any other purpose, section 7: (1) requires that the Division cease
26 imposing the assessment; and (2) provides that the regulations adopted to impose
27 the assessment are void.
28 Section 8 requires the Division to adopt regulations establishing administrative
29 penalties against a private emergency medical transport provider that fails to pay an
30 assessment in a timely manner. Section 8 authorizes the Division, after notifying
31 the provider, to: (1) deduct the amount of an unpaid assessment or administrative
32 penalty from future payments owed to the private emergency medical transport
33 provider under Medicaid; and (2) negotiate a payment plan with a delinquent
34 private emergency medical transport provider before making such deductions.
35 Section 8 also requires the Division to notify the health authority that issued a
36 private emergency medical transport provider a permit to own or operate an
37 ambulance in this State if the provider has failed to pay an assessment or
38 administrative penalty in a timely manner. Section 11 of this bill authorizes the
39 applicable health authority to, after receiving such a notification from the Division,
40 take certain disciplinary actions against the private emergency medical transport
41 provider.
42 Section 9 authorizes the Division to modify the amount of the assessment, the
43 enhanced rates of reimbursement or any other requirement established by sections
44 2-9 as necessary to receive federal financial participation to carry out the provisions
45 of sections 2-9. Section 9 also requires the suspension of the assessment and the
46 payment of enhanced rates of reimbursement upon the occurrence of certain events.
47 Section 9 requires the retroactive reimposition of such assessments and payments
48 when the event triggering the suspension is no longer applicable.
49 Sections 3-5 define certain terms and section 2 establishes the applicability of
50 those definitions. Section 10 of this bill requires the Director of the Department to
51 administer the provisions of sections 2-9 in the same manner as other provisions
52 relating to Medicaid.
