Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires each person conducting a business in this State to obtain a
2 state business license issued by the Secretary of State. (NRS 76.100) Existing law
3 also: (1) establishes certain fees that are required to be paid to the Secretary of State
4 to form a business entity or transact business in this State as a foreign business
5 entity; and (2) requires business entities to file an annual list of the officers,
-
*SB75*
– 2 –
6 directors, members and partners, as applicable, of the business entity, and pay an
7 annual fee to the Secretary of State to maintain the authority to transact business in
8 this State as a business entity. (See, e.g., NRS 78.150, 78.760, 80.050, 80.110,
9 86.263, 86.5461, 86.561) Sections 1, 3, 4, 7-10, 13-16, 18-21, 23, 25-27, 29-35, 37,
10 39-44, 47-53, 56-69 and 71-74 of this bill authorize the Secretary of State to
11 establish by regulation different amounts for: (1) the annual state business license
12 fee, the fees to form a business entity or transact business in this State as a foreign
13 business entity in this State, and the fees for the filing of an annual list by a
14 business entity; and (2) the penalties and fees for failing to pay such fees in a timely
15 manner. Sections 2 and 75 of this bill make conforming changes to update
16 references to provisions renumbered by this bill.
17 Existing law prohibits certain records which are written in a language other
18 than English from being filed or submitted for filing in the Office of the Secretary
19 of State unless accompanied by a verified translation of that record into the English
20 language. (NRS 78.028, 78A.015, 81.003, 82.528, 84.008, 86.566, 87A.270,
21 88.338, 89.027, 600.025) Sections 5, 11, 17, 22, 24, 36, 46, 55, 70 and 76 of this
22 bill authorize the Office of the Secretary of State to accept for filing a record which
23 is written in a language other than English if the Secretary of State determines that
24 sufficient resources are available to provide for a verified translation of that record
25 into the English language.
26 Existing law prohibits the Secretary of State from accepting for filing
27 documents used to form certain business entities, documents which amend the
28 documents used to form such entities or the records required to be filed by a foreign
29 corporation before doing business in this State, if the document or record provides
30 that the name of the business entity contains the words “architect,” “architecture,”
31 “registered architect,” “licensed architect,” “registered interior designer,”
32 “registered interior design,” “residential designer,” “registered residential
33 designer,” “licensed residential designer” or “residential design,” unless the State
34 Board of Architecture, Interior Design and Residential Design certifies that: (1) the
35 principals of the business entity hold a certificate of registration to practice the
36 relevant profession; or (2) the business entity meets the requirements to do business
37 as an entity whose ownership consists of both persons who are qualified to practice
38 the relevant profession and persons who are not so qualified or who are qualified to
39 practice a different profession regulated by the Board. (NRS 78.045, 80.010,
40 86.171, 87.450, 87A.175, 88.320, 623.349) As an alternative to a certification from
41 the Board, Sections 6, 12, 28, 38, 45, and 54 of this bill authorize the Secretary of
42 State to accept documents on behalf of a business entity that uses one of the
43 restricted professional titles in its name if the principals of the business entity
44 present documentation satisfactory to the Secretary of State that: (1) the principals
45 hold a certificate of registration to practice the relevant profession; or (2) the
46 business entity meets the requirements to do business as an entity whose ownership
47 consists of both persons who are qualified to practice the relevant profession and
48 persons who are not so qualified or who are qualified to practice a different
49 profession regulated by the Board.
50 Existing law authorizes a person who is using a trademark, trade name or
51 service mark in this State to register that mark with the Secretary of State. (NRS
52 600.340) The Secretary of State is authorized, for the purposes of administrative
53 convenience, to adopt regulations that define general classes of goods and services
54 for which a mark may be registered. (NRS 600.400) An application for registration
55 must identify the class of the goods or services, as designated by the Secretary of
56 State, in connection with which the mark is used. (NRS 600.340) Section 79 of this
57 bill removes the authority for the Secretary of State to define the classes of goods
58 and services for which a mark may be registered and instead sets forth the schedule
59 of classes of goods and services adopted by the United States Patent and Trademark
60 Office for the purpose of classifying marks which are registered federally.
-
*SB75*
– 3 –
61 Section 77 of this bill makes a conforming change to reflect that the classes of
62 goods and services for which a mark may be registered will no longer be defined by
63 the Secretary of State.
64 Existing law authorizes a person to assign a mark and its registration. (NRS
65 600.370) Section 78 of this bill requires an assignment of a mark to be made on a
66 form prescribed by the Secretary of State.

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires each person conducting a business in this State to obtain a
2 state business license issued by the Secretary of State. (NRS 76.100) Existing law
3 also: (1) establishes certain fees that are required to be paid to the Secretary of State
4 to form a business entity or transact business in this State as a foreign business
5 entity; and (2) requires business entities to file an annual list of the officers,
-
*SB75*

– 2 –
6 directors, members and partners, as applicable, of the business entity, and pay an
7 annual fee to the Secretary of State to maintain the authority to transact business in
8 this State as a business entity. (See, e.g., NRS 78.150, 78.760, 80.050, 80.110,
9 86.263, 86.5461, 86.561) Sections 1, 3, 4, 7-10, 13-16, 18-21, 23, 25-27, 29-35, 37,
10 39-44, 47-53, 56-69 and 71-74 of this bill authorize the Secretary of State to
11 establish by regulation different amounts for: (1) the annual state business license
12 fee, the fees to form a business entity or transact business in this State as a foreign
13 business entity in this State, and the fees for the filing of an annual list by a
14 business entity; and (2) the penalties and fees for failing to pay such fees in a timely
15 manner. Sections 2 and 75 of this bill make conforming changes to update
16 references to provisions renumbered by this bill.
17 Existing law prohibits certain records which are written in a language other
18 than English from being filed or submitted for filing in the Office of the Secretary
19 of State unless accompanied by a verified translation of that record into the English
20 language. (NRS 78.028, 78A.015, 81.003, 82.528, 84.008, 86.566, 87A.270,
21 88.338, 89.027, 600.025) Sections 5, 11, 17, 22, 24, 36, 46, 55, 70 and 76 of this
22 bill authorize the Office of the Secretary of State to accept for filing a record which
23 is written in a language other than English if the Secretary of State determines that
24 sufficient resources are available to provide for a verified translation of that record
25 into the English language.
26 Existing law prohibits the Secretary of State from accepting for filing
27 documents used to form certain business entities, documents which amend the
28 documents used to form such entities or the records required to be filed by a foreign
29 corporation before doing business in this State, if the document or record provides
30 that the name of the business entity contains the words “architect,” “architecture,”
31 “registered architect,” “licensed architect,” “registered interior designer,”
32 “registered interior design,” “residential designer,” “registered residential
33 designer,” “licensed residential designer” or “residential design,” unless the State
34 Board of Architecture, Interior Design and Residential Design certifies that: (1) the
35 principals of the business entity hold a certificate of registration to practice the
36 relevant profession; or (2) the business entity meets the requirements to do business
37 as an entity whose ownership consists of both persons who are qualified to practice
38 the relevant profession and persons who are not so qualified or who are qualified to
39 practice a different profession regulated by the Board. (NRS 78.045, 80.010,
40 86.171, 87.450, 87A.175, 88.320, 623.349) As an alternative to a certification from
41 the Board, Sections 6, 12, 28, 38, 45, and 54 of this bill authorize the Secretary of
42 State to accept documents on behalf of a business entity that uses one of the
43 restricted professional titles in its name if the principals of the business entity
44 present documentation satisfactory to the Secretary of State that: (1) the principals
45 hold a certificate of registration to practice the relevant profession; or (2) the
46 business entity meets the requirements to do business as an entity whose ownership
47 consists of both persons who are qualified to practice the relevant profession and
48 persons who are not so qualified or who are qualified to practice a different
49 profession regulated by the Board.
50 Existing law authorizes a person who is using a trademark, trade name or
51 service mark in this State to register that mark with the Secretary of State. (NRS
52 600.340) The Secretary of State is authorized, for the purposes of administrative
53 convenience, to adopt regulations that define general classes of goods and services
54 for which a mark may be registered. (NRS 600.400) An application for registration
55 must identify the class of the goods or services, as designated by the Secretary of
56 State, in connection with which the mark is used. (NRS 600.340) Section 79 of this
57 bill removes the authority for the Secretary of State to define the classes of goods
58 and services for which a mark may be registered and instead sets forth the schedule
59 of classes of goods and services adopted by the United States Patent and Trademark
60 Office for the purpose of classifying marks which are registered federally.
-
*SB75*

– 3 –
61 Section 77 of this bill makes a conforming change to reflect that the classes of
62 goods and services for which a mark may be registered will no longer be defined by
63 the Secretary of State.
64 Existing law authorizes a person to assign a mark and its registration. (NRS
65 600.370) Section 78 of this bill requires an assignment of a mark to be made on a
66 form prescribed by the Secretary of State.
