Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires each person conducting a business in this State to obtain a state
2 business license issued by the Secretary of State. (NRS 76.100) Existing law also: (1)
3 establishes certain fees that are required to be paid to the Secretary of State to form a business
4 entity or transact business in this State as a foreign business entity; and (2) requires business
5 entities to file an annual list of the officers, directors, members and partners, as applicable, of
Senate Amendment No. 336 to Senate Bill No. 75 Page 4
6 the business entity, and pay an annual fee to the Secretary of State to maintain the authority to
7 transact business in this State as a business entity. (See, e.g., NRS 78.150, 78.760, 80.050,
8 80.110, 86.263, 86.5461, 86.561) Sections 1, 3, 4, [7-10,] 7-9, 10, 13-16, 18-21, 23, 25-27,
9 29-35, 37, 39-44, 47-53, 56-69 and 71-74 of this bill authorize the Secretary of State to
10 establish by regulation [different] lower amounts for: (1) the annual state business license fee,
11 the fees to form a business entity or transact business in this State as a foreign business entity
12 in this State, and the fees for the filing of an annual list by a business entity; and (2) the
13 penalties and fees for failing to pay such fees in a timely manner. Sections 2 and 75 of this
14 bill make conforming changes to update references to provisions renumbered by this bill.
15 Existing law imposes fees to file certain documents with the Secretary of State to
16 dissolve a business entity or cancel the registration of a foreign business entity. (NRS
17 78.780, 82.531, 84.015, 86.561, 87.470, 87A.315, 88.415, 88A.900) Sections 9.5, 18.5, 23,
18 25, 31.5, 34.5, 35, 38.5, 41.5, 50, 50.5, 53.5, 59, 59.5, 62.5, 65.5, 68.5, 69 and 79.7 of this
19 bill eliminate these fees.
20 Existing law requires the Secretary of State to send a notice to a person who holds a
21 state business license notifying the person of the fee to renew the license and the
22 requirement to file an application for renewal of the license. (NRS 76.130) Section 4 of
23 this bill authorizes the Secretary of State to provide this notice electronically, unless the
24 person has requested to receive communications by mail. Section 4 also authorizes the
25 Secretary of State to establish a procedure for a person who has provided payment
26 information to the Secretary of State to apply to automatically renew his or her state
27 business license and pay the fee.
28 Existing law requires certain entities doing business in this State to appoint and keep
29 a registered agent who resides or is located in this State upon whom legal process may be
30 served. (NRS 14.020) The Model Registered Agents Act governs registered agents.
31 (Chapter 77 of NRS) Section 4.5 of this bill requires, whenever a provision of the Model
32 Registered Agents Act requires a filing to state an address, the filing to include an
33 electronic mail address in addition to a physical address.
34 Existing law prohibits certain records which are written in a language other than English
35 from being filed or submitted for filing in the Office of the Secretary of State unless
36 accompanied by a verified translation of that record into the English language. (NRS 78.028,
37 78A.015, 81.003, 82.528, 84.008, 86.566, 87A.270, 88.338, 89.027, 600.025) Sections 5, 11,
38 17, 22, 24, 36, 46, 55, 70 and 76 of this bill authorize the Office of the Secretary of State to
39 accept for filing a record which is written in a language other than English if the Secretary of
40 State determines that sufficient resources are available to provide for a verified translation of
41 that record into the English language.
42 Existing law prohibits the Secretary of State from accepting for filing documents used to
43 form certain business entities, documents which amend the documents used to form such
44 entities or the records required to be filed by a foreign corporation before doing business in
45 this State, if the document or record provides that the name of the business entity contains the
46 words “architect,” “architecture,” “registered architect,” “licensed architect,” “registered
47 interior designer,” “registered interior design,” “residential designer,” “registered residential
48 designer,” “licensed residential designer” or “residential design,” unless the State Board of
49 Architecture, Interior Design and Residential Design certifies that: (1) the principals of the
50 business entity hold a certificate of registration to practice the relevant profession; or (2) the
51 business entity meets the requirements to do business as an entity whose ownership consists of
52 both persons who are qualified to practice the relevant profession and persons who are not so
53 qualified or who are qualified to practice a different profession regulated by the Board. (NRS
54 78.045, 80.010, 86.171, 87.450, 87A.175, 88.320, 623.349) As an alternative to a certification
55 from the Board, Sections 6, 12, 28, 38, 45, and 54 of this bill authorize the Secretary of State
56 to accept documents on behalf of a business entity that uses one of the restricted professional
57 titles in its name if the principals of the business entity present documentation satisfactory to
58 the Secretary of State that: (1) the principals hold a certificate of registration to practice the
59 relevant profession; or (2) the business entity meets the requirements to do business as an
60 entity whose ownership consists of both persons who are qualified to practice the relevant
61 profession and persons who are not so qualified or who are qualified to practice a different
62 profession regulated by the Board.
63 Existing law prohibits a person from practicing architecture in this State without a
64 certificate of registration issued by the State Board of Architecture, Interior Design and
Senate Amendment No. 336 to Senate Bill No. 75 Page 5
65 Residential Design. (NRS 623.180) Before receiving a certificate of registration, existing
66 law requires an applicant to pass an examination adopted by the Board. (NRS 623.200)
67 Section 79.3 of this bill authorizes the Board to accept, in lieu of an examination,
68 evidence that the application is a laureate of the Pritzker Architecture Prize.
69 Existing law authorizes a person who is using a trademark, trade name or service mark in
70 this State to register that mark with the Secretary of State. (NRS 600.340) The Secretary of
71 State is authorized, for the purposes of administrative convenience, to adopt regulations that
72 define general classes of goods and services for which a mark may be registered. (NRS
73 600.400) An application for registration must identify the class of the goods or services, as
74 designated by the Secretary of State, in connection with which the mark is used. (NRS
75 600.340) Section 79 of this bill removes the authority for the Secretary of State to define the
76 classes of goods and services for which a mark may be registered and instead sets forth the
77 schedule of classes of goods and services adopted by the United States Patent and Trademark
78 Office for the purpose of classifying marks which are registered federally. Section 77 of this
79 bill makes a conforming change to reflect that the classes of goods and services for which a
80 mark may be registered will no longer be defined by the Secretary of State.
81 Existing law authorizes a person to assign a mark and its registration. (NRS 600.370)
82 Section 78 of this bill requires an assignment of a mark to be made on a form prescribed by
83 the Secretary of State.

37 state business license fee required by this section. Failure of any person to pay
38 the state business license fee as a result of not maintaining current payment
39 information with the Secretary of State does not excuse the person from the
40 penalty imposed by law for failure to timely pay the state business license fee.
41 6. A person who continues to do business in this State without renewing the
42 person’s state business license before its renewal date is subject to the fees and

44 cancellation of the person’s state business license with the Secretary of State.
45 [6.] 7. The Secretary of State shall waive the annual state business license fee

Senate Amendment No. 336 to Senate Bill No. 75 Page 9

2 penalty, as applicable, set forth in this section. If the Secretary of State
3 establishes by regulation the amount of:
4 (a) The fee for the renewal of a state business license, the amount of the fee
5 for such renewal is the amount of the fee established by the Secretary of State by
6 regulation.
7 (b) The penalty required to be paid pursuant to this section by a person who
8 fails to pay the annual state business license fee in a timely manner, the amount
9 of any such penalty must be the amount established by the Secretary of State by

22 the Secretary of State pursuant to the provisions of this chapter unless it is
23 accompanied by a verified translation of that record into the English language.

42 the reinstatement relates back to and takes effect on the effective date of the
43 revocation, and the limited partnership’s status as a limited partnership continues as
44 if the revocation had never occurred.

43 in full force and effect.

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires each person conducting a business in this State to obtain a state
2 business license issued by the Secretary of State. (NRS 76.100) Existing law also: (1)
3 establishes certain fees that are required to be paid to the Secretary of State to form a business
4 entity or transact business in this State as a foreign business entity; and (2) requires business
5 entities to file an annual list of the officers, directors, members and partners, as applicable, of

Senate Amendment No. 336 to Senate Bill No. 75 Page 4
6 the business entity, and pay an annual fee to the Secretary of State to maintain the authority to
7 transact business in this State as a business entity. (See, e.g., NRS 78.150, 78.760, 80.050,
8 80.110, 86.263, 86.5461, 86.561) Sections 1, 3, 4, [7-10,] 7-9, 10, 13-16, 18-21, 23, 25-27,
9 29-35, 37, 39-44, 47-53, 56-69 and 71-74 of this bill authorize the Secretary of State to
10 establish by regulation [different] lower amounts for: (1) the annual state business license fee,
11 the fees to form a business entity or transact business in this State as a foreign business entity
12 in this State, and the fees for the filing of an annual list by a business entity; and (2) the
13 penalties and fees for failing to pay such fees in a timely manner. Sections 2 and 75 of this
14 bill make conforming changes to update references to provisions renumbered by this bill.
15 Existing law imposes fees to file certain documents with the Secretary of State to
16 dissolve a business entity or cancel the registration of a foreign business entity. (NRS
17 78.780, 82.531, 84.015, 86.561, 87.470, 87A.315, 88.415, 88A.900) Sections 9.5, 18.5, 23,
18 25, 31.5, 34.5, 35, 38.5, 41.5, 50, 50.5, 53.5, 59, 59.5, 62.5, 65.5, 68.5, 69 and 79.7 of this
19 bill eliminate these fees.
20 Existing law requires the Secretary of State to send a notice to a person who holds a
21 state business license notifying the person of the fee to renew the license and the
22 requirement to file an application for renewal of the license. (NRS 76.130) Section 4 of
23 this bill authorizes the Secretary of State to provide this notice electronically, unless the
24 person has requested to receive communications by mail. Section 4 also authorizes the
25 Secretary of State to establish a procedure for a person who has provided payment
26 information to the Secretary of State to apply to automatically renew his or her state
27 business license and pay the fee.
28 Existing law requires certain entities doing business in this State to appoint and keep
29 a registered agent who resides or is located in this State upon whom legal process may be
30 served. (NRS 14.020) The Model Registered Agents Act governs registered agents.
31 (Chapter 77 of NRS) Section 4.5 of this bill requires, whenever a provision of the Model
32 Registered Agents Act requires a filing to state an address, the filing to include an
33 electronic mail address in addition to a physical address.
34 Existing law prohibits certain records which are written in a language other than English
35 from being filed or submitted for filing in the Office of the Secretary of State unless
36 accompanied by a verified translation of that record into the English language. (NRS 78.028,
37 78A.015, 81.003, 82.528, 84.008, 86.566, 87A.270, 88.338, 89.027, 600.025) Sections 5, 11,
38 17, 22, 24, 36, 46, 55, 70 and 76 of this bill authorize the Office of the Secretary of State to
39 accept for filing a record which is written in a language other than English if the Secretary of
40 State determines that sufficient resources are available to provide for a verified translation of
41 that record into the English language.
42 Existing law prohibits the Secretary of State from accepting for filing documents used to
43 form certain business entities, documents which amend the documents used to form such
44 entities or the records required to be filed by a foreign corporation before doing business in
45 this State, if the document or record provides that the name of the business entity contains the
46 words “architect,” “architecture,” “registered architect,” “licensed architect,” “registered
47 interior designer,” “registered interior design,” “residential designer,” “registered residential
48 designer,” “licensed residential designer” or “residential design,” unless the State Board of
49 Architecture, Interior Design and Residential Design certifies that: (1) the principals of the
50 business entity hold a certificate of registration to practice the relevant profession; or (2) the
51 business entity meets the requirements to do business as an entity whose ownership consists of
52 both persons who are qualified to practice the relevant profession and persons who are not so
53 qualified or who are qualified to practice a different profession regulated by the Board. (NRS
54 78.045, 80.010, 86.171, 87.450, 87A.175, 88.320, 623.349) As an alternative to a certification
55 from the Board, Sections 6, 12, 28, 38, 45, and 54 of this bill authorize the Secretary of State
56 to accept documents on behalf of a business entity that uses one of the restricted professional
57 titles in its name if the principals of the business entity present documentation satisfactory to
58 the Secretary of State that: (1) the principals hold a certificate of registration to practice the
59 relevant profession; or (2) the business entity meets the requirements to do business as an
60 entity whose ownership consists of both persons who are qualified to practice the relevant
61 profession and persons who are not so qualified or who are qualified to practice a different
62 profession regulated by the Board.
63 Existing law prohibits a person from practicing architecture in this State without a
64 certificate of registration issued by the State Board of Architecture, Interior Design and

Senate Amendment No. 336 to Senate Bill No. 75 Page 5
65 Residential Design. (NRS 623.180) Before receiving a certificate of registration, existing
66 law requires an applicant to pass an examination adopted by the Board. (NRS 623.200)
67 Section 79.3 of this bill authorizes the Board to accept, in lieu of an examination,
68 evidence that the application is a laureate of the Pritzker Architecture Prize.
69 Existing law authorizes a person who is using a trademark, trade name or service mark in
70 this State to register that mark with the Secretary of State. (NRS 600.340) The Secretary of
71 State is authorized, for the purposes of administrative convenience, to adopt regulations that
72 define general classes of goods and services for which a mark may be registered. (NRS
73 600.400) An application for registration must identify the class of the goods or services, as
74 designated by the Secretary of State, in connection with which the mark is used. (NRS
75 600.340) Section 79 of this bill removes the authority for the Secretary of State to define the
76 classes of goods and services for which a mark may be registered and instead sets forth the
77 schedule of classes of goods and services adopted by the United States Patent and Trademark
78 Office for the purpose of classifying marks which are registered federally. Section 77 of this
79 bill makes a conforming change to reflect that the classes of goods and services for which a
80 mark may be registered will no longer be defined by the Secretary of State.
81 Existing law authorizes a person to assign a mark and its registration. (NRS 600.370)
82 Section 78 of this bill requires an assignment of a mark to be made on a form prescribed by
83 the Secretary of State.
