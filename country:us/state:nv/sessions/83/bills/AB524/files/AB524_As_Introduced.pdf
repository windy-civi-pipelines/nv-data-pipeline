AN ACT relating to motor carriers; exempting certain common
motor carriers from provisions governing short-term
lessors of motor vehicles; requiring the Nevada
Transportation Authority to adopt regulations authorizing
certain common motor carriers to deviate from certain
requirements and regulations under circumstances
prescribed by the Authority; exempting certain applicants

fingerprinting requirements; repealing a provision relating

providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the supervision and regulation of common carriers
2 and contract carriers of passengers by the Nevada Transportation Authority. (NRS
3 706.072, 706.166) Existing regulations of the Authority establish requirements for
4 common motor carriers who provide special services, which are defined as the
5 transportation of persons who have acquired the use of a vehicle for a special event,
6 or for a specific purpose approved by the Authority, between definite points of
7 origin and destination, at a per capita rate. (NAC 706.119, 706.239) Section 3 of
8 this bill requires the Authority to adopt regulations to establish circumstances under
9 which a common motor carrier that provides special services may deviate, without
10 obtaining approval from the Authority for the deviation, from the otherwise
11 applicable terms of the permit issued to the common carrier or the generally
12 applicable regulations of the Authority governing common carriers. Section 3
13 defines the term “special services” in the same manner as the existing regulations of
14 the Authority governing such services.
15 Existing law provides requirements governing persons who engage in business
16 as a short-term lessor of motor vehicles, including a requirement to obtain a license

– 2 –
17 from the Department of Motor Vehicles. (NRS 482.300, 482.363) Section 1 of this
18 bill provides that the term “lease” for the purpose of such provisions does not
19 include the providing of special services by a common motor carrier. Section 2 of
20 this bill provides that a common motor carrier who is authorized to provide special
21 services is not engaged in the activities of a short-term lessor for the purpose of the
22 provisions requiring short-term lessors to be licensed.
23 Existing law: (1) prohibits a person from driving a motor vehicle for a fully
24 regulated carrier of passengers as an employee, independent contractor or lessee
25 unless the person has been issued a driver’s permit by the Authority; and (2)
26 requires an applicant for a driver’s permit to submit a complete set of fingerprints
27 to the Authority for the purpose of investigating the applicant’s background. (NRS
28 706.462) Section 4 of this bill exempts an applicant for a driver’s permit who is a
29 person registered with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration and who
30 has an active USDOT number issued by the United States Department of
31 Transportation from the requirement to submit a complete set of fingerprints.
32 Section 5 of this bill repeals a provision which requires the Department of
33 Motor Vehicles to license every common, contract and private motor carrier who is
34 required to be licensed by the provisions governing motor carriers.

23 which would otherwise be applicable to such services. In adopting
