7 technology, before giving testimony, the witness must be sworn and must sign a written
8 declaration which acknowledges that the witness: (1) understands that he or she is subject to
9 the jurisdiction of the courts of this State and may be subject to criminal prosecution for the
10 commission of any crime in connection with his or her testimony, including, without

18 the State to file, together with the declaration, a notice stating [the reason why] whether it is
19 necessary for the witness to testify at the preliminary examination or grand jury proceeding

21 miles from the place of the preliminary examination or grand jury proceeding or is
