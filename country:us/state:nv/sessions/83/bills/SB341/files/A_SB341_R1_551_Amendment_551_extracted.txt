9 the jurisdiction of the courts of this State and may be subject to criminal prosecution for the
10 commission of any crime in connection with his or her testimony, including, without

12 Sections 1 and 2 of this bill: (1) [remove the authorization for a witness to testify at a

18 the court, together with the declaration, a notice stating whether it is necessary for the witness
19 to testify at the preliminary examination or grand jury proceeding through the use of
20 audiovisual technology because the witness resides more than 100 miles from the place of the
21 preliminary examination or grand jury proceeding [or] , the witness is unable to attend the
22 preliminary examination or grand jury proceeding because of a medical condition [.] or good
