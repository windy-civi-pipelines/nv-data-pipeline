AN ACT relating to transportation; revising the minimum dollar amount of
transportation network company insurance that a transportation
network company, a driver or a monitored autonomous vehicle
provider is required to maintain under certain circumstances; defining
certain terms related to delivery network companies; providing that
certain delivery network companies are not vicariously liable for any
acts or omissions of a driver who provides delivery services for the
delivery network company; providing that a transportation network
company is not vicariously liable for any acts or omissions of a driver
who provides transportation services for the transportation network
company; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth various provisions governing transportation network companies
2 which enter into agreements with one or more drivers to receive connections to potential
3 passengers from the company in exchange for the payment of a fee by the driver to the
4 company. (Chapter 706A of NRS) Existing law requires a transportation network company or
5 driver to continuously provide, during any period in which the driver is providing
6 transportation services, transportation network company insurance for the payment of
7 liabilities arising from the operation of a motor vehicle by the driver. Existing law sets forth
8 certain minimum amounts of coverage that are required to be provided by a transportation
9 network company or driver for the periods in which the driver is providing transportation
10 services and for the periods in which a driver is logged into the digital network or software
11 application service of the transportation network company and available to receive requests
12 for transportation services but is not otherwise providing transportation services. (NRS
13 690B.470) Section 1 of this bill reduces the minimum amount of transportation network
14 company insurance required to be maintained while a driver is providing transportation
15 services from an amount of not less than $1,500,000 to an amount of not less than $1,000,000.
16 Section 3 of this bill provides that a transportation network company is not vicariously
17 liable for any act or omission of a driver or passenger that harms a person or property under
18 any theory of liability or duty of care.
19 Existing law requires every monitored autonomous vehicle provider to continuously
20 provide transportation network company insurance in an amount of not less than $1,500,000
21 during any period in which the monitored autonomous vehicle provider is operating a

Assembly Amendment No. 3 to Assembly Bill No. 523 Page 4
22 monitored autonomous vehicle, regardless of whether the provider is providing transportation
23 services. (NRS 690B.470) Section 1 reduces the minimum amount of transportation network
24 company insurance required to be maintained to an amount of not less than $1,000,000.
25 Section 2.3 of this bill defines “delivery network company” to mean certain entities
26 that operate in this State and use a digital network to connect a customer to a driver for
27 the purpose of providing delivery services. Sections 2.2 and 2.4-2.8 of this bill define
28 certain other terms relating to delivery network companies. Section [2] 2.9 of this bill
29 provides that a delivery network company [which uses a digital network to connect a customer
30 to a driver for the purpose of providing delivery services] is not vicariously liable for any act
31 or omission of a driver that harms a person or property under any theory of liability or duty of
32 care. [Section 2 defines “delivery services” to mean the delivery of an item by a person
33 through the use of a digital network of a delivery network company to a customer located
34 within 50 miles of the pick-up location of the item.] Section [2] 2.9 further provides that a
35 delivery network company shall be deemed to not control, direct or manage a driver or the
36 personal [motor] vehicle of a driver. Additionally, section [2] 2.9 limits , for any driver who
37 uses a personal vehicle which is a motor vehicle, the applicability of its provisions to a
38 delivery network company that [maintains] maintained a [casualty] motor vehicle insurance
39 policy in an amount of not less than $1,000,000.
