AN ACT relating to transportation; revising the minimum dollar
amount of transportation network company insurance that
a transportation network company, a driver or a
monitored autonomous vehicle provider is required to

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth various provisions governing transportation network
2 companies which enter into agreements with one or more drivers to receive
3 connections to potential passengers from the company in exchange for the payment
4 of a fee by the driver to the company. (Chapter 706A of NRS) Existing law requires
5 a transportation network company or driver to continuously provide, during any
6 period in which the driver is providing transportation services, transportation
7 network company insurance for the payment of liabilities arising from the operation
8 of a motor vehicle by the driver. Existing law sets forth certain minimum amounts
9 of coverage that are required to be provided by a transportation network company
10 or driver for the periods in which the driver is providing transportation services and
11 for the periods in which a driver is logged into the digital network or software
12 application service of the transportation network company and available to receive

13 requests for transportation services but is not otherwise providing transportation
14 services. (NRS 690B.470) Section 1 of this bill reduces the minimum amount of
15 transportation network company insurance required to be maintained while a driver
16 is providing transportation services from an amount of not less than $1,500,000 to
17 an amount of not less than $1,000,000.
18 Section 3 of this bill provides that a transportation network company is not
19 vicariously liable for any act or omission of a driver or passenger that harms a
20 person or property under any theory of liability or duty of care.
21 Existing law requires every monitored autonomous vehicle provider to
22 continuously provide transportation network company insurance in an amount of
23 not less than $1,500,000 during any period in which the monitored autonomous
24 vehicle provider is operating a monitored autonomous vehicle, regardless of
25 whether the provider is providing transportation services. (NRS 690B.470) Section
26 1 reduces the minimum amount of transportation network company insurance
27 required to be maintained to an amount of not less than $1,000,000.
28 Section 2.3 of this bill defines “delivery network company” to mean certain
29 entities that operate in this State and use a digital network to connect a customer to
30 a driver for the purpose of providing delivery services. Sections 2.2 and 2.4-2.8 of
31 this bill define certain other terms relating to delivery network companies. Section
32 2.9 of this bill provides that a delivery network company is not vicariously liable
33 for any act or omission of a driver that harms a person or property under any theory
34 of liability or duty of care. Section 2.9 further provides that a delivery network
35 company shall be deemed to not control, direct or manage a driver or the personal
36 vehicle of a driver. Additionally, section 2.9 limits, for any driver who uses a
37 personal vehicle which is a motor vehicle, the applicability of its provisions to a
38 delivery network company that maintained a motor vehicle insurance policy in an
39 amount of not less than $1,000,000.
