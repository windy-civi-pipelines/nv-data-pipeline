EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to transportation; revising the minimum dollar
amount of transportation network company insurance that
a transportation network company, a driver or a
monitored autonomous vehicle provider is required to
maintain under certain circumstances; providing that
certain delivery network companies are not vicariously
liable for any acts or omissions of a driver who provides
delivery services for the delivery network company;
providing that a transportation network company is not
vicariously liable for any acts or omissions of a driver
who provides transportation services for the transportation
network company; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth various provisions governing transportation network
2 companies which enter into agreements with one or more drivers to receive
3 connections to potential passengers from the company in exchange for the payment
4 of a fee by the driver to the company. (Chapter 706A of NRS) Existing law requires
5 a transportation network company or driver to continuously provide, during any
6 period in which the driver is providing transportation services, transportation
7 network company insurance for the payment of liabilities arising from the operation
8 of a motor vehicle by the driver. Existing law sets forth certain minimum amounts
9 of coverage that are required to be provided by a transportation network company
10 or driver for the periods in which the driver is providing transportation services and
11 for the periods in which a driver is logged into the digital network or software
12 application service of the transportation network company and available to receive
13 requests for transportation services but is not otherwise providing transportation

14 services. (NRS 690B.470) Section 1 of this bill reduces the minimum amount of
15 transportation network company insurance required to be maintained while a driver
16 is providing transportation services from an amount of not less than $1,500,000 to
17 an amount of not less than $1,000,000.
18 Section 3 of this bill provides that a transportation network company is not
19 vicariously liable for any act or omission of a driver or passenger that harms a
20 person or property under any theory of liability or duty of care.
21 Existing law requires every monitored autonomous vehicle provider to
22 continuously provide transportation network company insurance in an amount of
23 not less than $1,500,000 during any period in which the monitored autonomous
24 vehicle provider is operating a monitored autonomous vehicle, regardless of
25 whether the provider is providing transportation services. (NRS 690B.470) Section
26 1 reduces the minimum amount of transportation network company insurance
27 required to be maintained to an amount of not less than $1,000,000.
28 Section 2 of this bill provides that a delivery network company which uses a
29 digital network to connect a customer to a driver for the purpose of providing
30 delivery services is not vicariously liable for any act or omission of a driver that
31 harms a person or property under any theory of liability or duty of care. Section 2
32 defines “delivery services” to mean the delivery of an item by a person through the
33 use of a digital network of a delivery network company to a customer located
34 within 50 miles of the pick-up location of the item. Section 2 further provides that a
35 delivery network company shall be deemed to not control, direct or manage a driver
36 or the personal motor vehicle of a driver. Additionally, section 2 limits the
37 applicability of its provisions to a delivery network company that maintains a
38 casualty insurance policy in an amount of not less than $1,000,000.
