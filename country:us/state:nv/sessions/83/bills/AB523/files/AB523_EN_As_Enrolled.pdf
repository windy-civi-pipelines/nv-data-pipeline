Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law sets forth various provisions governing transportation network
companies which enter into agreements with one or more drivers to receive
connections to potential passengers from the company in exchange for the payment
of a fee by the driver to the company. (Chapter 706A of NRS) Existing law requires
a transportation network company or driver to continuously provide, during any
period in which the driver is providing transportation services, transportation
network company insurance for the payment of liabilities arising from the operation
of a motor vehicle by the driver. Existing law sets forth certain minimum amounts
of coverage that are required to be provided by a transportation network company
or driver for the periods in which the driver is providing transportation services and
for the periods in which a driver is logged into the digital network or software
application service of the transportation network company and available to receive
requests for transportation services but is not otherwise providing transportation
services. (NRS 690B.470) Section 1 of this bill reduces the minimum amount of
transportation network company insurance required to be maintained while a driver
is providing transportation services from an amount of not less than $1,500,000 to
an amount of not less than $1,000,000.
Section 3 of this bill provides that a transportation network company is not
vicariously liable for any act or omission of a driver or passenger that harms a
person or property under any theory of liability or duty of care.
Existing law requires every monitored autonomous vehicle provider to
continuously provide transportation network company insurance in an amount of
not less than $1,500,000 during any period in which the monitored autonomous
vehicle provider is operating a monitored autonomous vehicle, regardless of
whether the provider is providing transportation services. (NRS 690B.470) Section
1 reduces the minimum amount of transportation network company insurance
required to be maintained to an amount of not less than $1,000,000.
Section 2.3 of this bill defines “delivery network company” to mean certain
entities that operate in this State and use a digital network to connect a customer to
a driver for the purpose of providing delivery services. Sections 2.2 and 2.4-2.8 of
this bill define certain other terms relating to delivery network companies.

Section 2.9 of this bill provides that a delivery network company is not vicariously
liable for any act or omission of a driver that harms a person or property under any
theory of liability or duty of care. Section 2.9 further provides that a delivery
network company shall be deemed to not control, direct or manage a driver or the
personal vehicle of a driver. Additionally, section 2.9 limits, for any driver who
uses a personal vehicle which is a motor vehicle, the applicability of its provisions
to a delivery network company that maintained a motor vehicle insurance policy in
an amount of not less than $1,000,000.
