EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to water; revising provisions governing the
appropriation of water for geothermal wells or dissolved
mineral resources; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides that, with certain exceptions, the consumptive use of
2 water brought to the surface outside of a geothermal well is subject to the
3 procedures governing the appropriation of water, except for: (1) water removed
4 from an aquifer or geothermal reservoir to develop and obtain geothermal resources
5 if the water is returned to or reinjected into the same aquifer or reservoir; and (2)
6 the reasonable loss of water under certain circumstances. (NRS 534A.040) Section
7 1 of this bill instead provides that any consumptive or nonconsumptive use of water
8 brought to the surface to develop and obtain geothermal resources is subject to
9 these procedures. Section 1 also removes the exception for water removed from an
10 aquifer or geothermal reservoir and instead creates an exception for water used for
11 an exploratory well.
12 Existing law provides that, with certain exceptions, the owner of real property
13 owns the rights to the underlying geothermal resources. (NRS 534A.050) Section 2
14 of this bill clarifies that underground waters belong to the public and the use of
15 such waters for the development of geothermal resources is subject to existing state
16 laws governing the appropriation of water.
17 Existing law requires a person to obtain a permit from the Administrator of the
18 Division of Minerals of the Commission on Mineral Resources and comply with
19 the conditions of the permit before he or she may drill or operate a geothermal well
20 or drill an exploratory well. (NRS 534A.060) Sections 3 and 4 of this bill require a
21 person to obtain a permit to appropriate water from the State Engineer before he or
22 she may drill or operate such a well, if the well uses water that is subject to the
23 procedures governing the appropriation of water.
24 Existing law provides that ownership of dissolved mineral resources is
25 determined by the applicable federal and state laws and regulations. (NRS
26 534B.010) Section 5 of this bill clarifies that underground waters containing
-

– 2 –
27 dissolved mineral resources belong to the public and are subject to state laws
28 governing the appropriation of water.
29 Existing law exempts from the procedures governing the appropriation of water
30 the reasonable loss of water of not more than 5 acre-feet during the testing and
31 sampling of water pumped within a dissolved mineral resource exploration project.
32 (NRS 534B.110) Existing law also requires a person seeking to drill a dissolved
33 mineral resource exploration well to obtain a permit from the Administrator. (NRS
34 534B.080) Section 6 of this bill requires that, upon receipt of an application for
35 such a permit, the Administrator must transmit the application to the State Engineer
36 for review. If the State Engineer determines that the application may interfere with
37 existing rights or protectable interests in existing domestic wells or threaten the
38 public interest, section 6 requires the applicant to obtain a permit to appropriate
39 water before he or she may proceed with the application. Section 8 of this bill
40 provides that this requirement is an exception to the exemption for the reasonable
41 loss of water of not more than 5 acre-feet.
42 Existing law requires, with certain exceptions, the Administrator to approve or
43 reject an application to drill a dissolved mineral resource exploration well within 30
44 days after receiving the application. (NRS 534B.090) Section 7 of this bill provides
45 an exception from this requirement if the State Engineer requires the applicant to
46 obtain a permit to appropriate water.

19 NRS do not apply to the reasonable loss of water of not more than 5
20 acre-feet during the testing and sampling of water pumped within a
21 dissolved mineral resource exploration project.
22 2. Any water pumped in excess of 5 acre-feet within a
23 dissolved mineral resource exploration project is subject to the
24 appropriation procedures of chapters 533 and 534 of NRS. An
25 operator of a dissolved mineral resource exploration project must
26 ensure that the project is in compliance with the appropriation
27 requirements of chapters 533 and 534 of NRS before the project
28 exceeds the threshold of 5-acre-feet.
29 3. As used in this section, “dissolved mineral resource
30 exploration project” means a project, which may consist of one or
31 more dissolved mineral resource exploration wells or boreholes or
32 both, that is conducted on:
33 (a) Private land owned or controlled by a natural person or an
34 exploration or mining company; or
35 (b) A mining claim on public land that is identified in an
