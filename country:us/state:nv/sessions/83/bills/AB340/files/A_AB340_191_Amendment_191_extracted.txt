EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to insurance; requiring certain health insurance to include
coverage for the screening, assessment and diagnosis of attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder, fetal alcohol spectrum disorders,
intellectual disabilities and specific learning disabilities for certain
persons; establishing certain administrative sanctions for failure to
provide such coverage; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires public and private policies of health insurance regulated under
2 Nevada law to include certain coverage. (NRS 287.010, 287.04335, 422.2717-422.27248,
3 689A.04033-689A.0465, 689B.0303-689B.0379, 689C.1652-689C.169, 689C.194-689C.195,
4 689C.425, 695A.184-695A.1875, 695A.265, 695B.1901-695B.1948, 695C.050, 695C.1691-
5 695C.176, 695G.162-695G.177) Existing law also requires employers to provide certain
6 benefits for health care to employees, including the coverage required of health insurers, if the
7 employer provides health benefits for its employees. (NRS 608.1555) Sections 1, 3-9, 11 and
8 13-15 of this bill require certain public and private policies of health insurance and health care
9 plans, including Medicaid, to include coverage for screening for and the assessment and
10 diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, fetal alcohol spectrum disorders,
11 intellectual disabilities and specific learning disabilities for persons covered by the policy
12 under the age of 18 years or, if enrolled in high school, until the person reaches the age of 22
13 years. Section 2 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner of Insurance to require certain
14 policies of insurance issued by a domestic insurer to a person residing in another state to
15 include such coverage. Section 10 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner to suspend or
16 revoke the certificate of a health maintenance organization that fails to comply with the
17 requirements of section 8. The Commissioner would also be authorized under existing law to
18 take such action against other health insurers who fail to comply with the requirements of
Assembly Amendment No. 191 to Assembly Bill No. 340 Page 4
19 sections 1, 3-7 and 11 of this bill. (NRS 680A.200) Section 12 of this bill makes a
20 conforming change to require the Director of the Department of Health and Human Services
21 to administer the provisions of section 15 in the same manner as other provisions relating to
22 Medicaid.

(NOT REQUESTED BY AFFECTED LOCAL GOVERNMENT)
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to insurance; requiring certain health insurance to include
coverage for the screening, assessment and diagnosis of attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder, fetal alcohol spectrum disorders,
intellectual disabilities and specific learning disabilities for certain
persons; establishing certain administrative sanctions for failure to
provide such coverage; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires public and private policies of health insurance regulated under
2 Nevada law to include certain coverage. (NRS 287.010, 287.04335, 422.2717-422.27248,
3 689A.04033-689A.0465, 689B.0303-689B.0379, 689C.1652-689C.169, 689C.194-689C.195,
4 689C.425, 695A.184-695A.1875, 695A.265, 695B.1901-695B.1948, 695C.050, 695C.1691-
5 695C.176, 695G.162-695G.177) Existing law also requires employers to provide certain
6 benefits for health care to employees, including the coverage required of health insurers, if the
7 employer provides health benefits for its employees. (NRS 608.1555) Sections 1, 3-9, 11 and
8 13-15 of this bill require certain public and private policies of health insurance and health care
9 plans, including Medicaid, to include coverage for screening for and the assessment and
10 diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, fetal alcohol spectrum disorders,
11 intellectual disabilities and specific learning disabilities for persons covered by the policy
12 under the age of 18 years or, if enrolled in high school, until the person reaches the age of 22
13 years. Section 2 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner of Insurance to require certain
14 policies of insurance issued by a domestic insurer to a person residing in another state to
15 include such coverage. Section 10 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner to suspend or
16 revoke the certificate of a health maintenance organization that fails to comply with the
17 requirements of section 8. The Commissioner would also be authorized under existing law to
18 take such action against other health insurers who fail to comply with the requirements of

Assembly Amendment No. 191 to Assembly Bill No. 340 Page 4
19 sections 1, 3-7 and 11 of this bill. (NRS 680A.200) Section 12 of this bill makes a
20 conforming change to require the Director of the Department of Health and Human Services
21 to administer the provisions of section 15 in the same manner as other provisions relating to
22 Medicaid.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 689A of NRS is hereby amended by adding thereto a new
2 section to read as follows:
3 1. An insurer that issues a policy of health insurance shall include in the
4 policy coverage for screening for and the assessment and diagnosis of attention
5 deficit hyperactivity disorder, fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, intellectual
6 disabilities and specific learning disabilities for insureds under the age of 18
7 years or, if enrolled in high school, until the insured reaches the age of 22 years.
8 2. [An insurer that issues a policy of health insurance must ensure that the
9 benefits required by subsection 1 are made available to an insured through a
10 provider of health care who participates in the network plan of the insurer.
11 3.] Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring an insurer that
12 issues a policy of health insurance to provide reimbursement to a school for
13 services delivered through school services.
14 [4.] 3. A policy of health insurance subject to the provisions of this chapter
15 which is delivered, issued for delivery or renewed on or after January 1, 2026,
16 has the legal effect of including the coverage required by this section, and any
17 provision of the policy or renewal which is in conflict with this section is void.
18 [5.] 4. As used in this section:
19 (a) “Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder” has the meaning ascribed to it in NRS
20 432B.0655.
21 (b) “Intellectual disability” has the meaning ascribed to it in NRS 435.007.
22 (c) [“Network plan” means a policy of health insurance offered by an
23 insurer under which the financing and delivery of medical care, including items
24 and services paid for as medical care, are provided, in whole or in part, through a
25 defined set of providers under contract with the insurer. The term does not
26 include an arrangement for the financing of premiums.
27 (d) “Provider of health care” has the meaning ascribed to it in NRS 629.031.
28 (e)] “Specific learning disability” has the meaning ascribed to it in NRS
29 388.417.
