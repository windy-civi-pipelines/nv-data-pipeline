Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires public and private policies of health insurance regulated
2 under Nevada law to include certain coverage. (NRS 287.010, 287.04335,
3 422.2717-422.27248, 689A.04033-689A.0465, 689B.0303-689B.0379, 689C.1652-
4 689C.169, 689C.194-689C.195, 689C.425, 695A.184-695A.1875, 695A.265,
5 695B.1901-695B.1948, 695C.050, 695C.1691-695C.176, 695G.162-695G.177)
6 Existing law also requires employers to provide certain benefits for health care to
7 employees, including the coverage required of health insurers, if the employer
8 provides health benefits for its employees. (NRS 608.1555) Sections 1, 3-9, 11 and
9 13-15 of this bill require certain public and private policies of health insurance and
10 health care plans, including Medicaid, to include coverage for screening for and the
11 assessment and diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, fetal alcohol

– 2 –
12 spectrum disorders, intellectual disabilities and specific learning disabilities for
13 persons covered by the policy under the age of 18 years or, if enrolled in high
14 school, until the person reaches the age of 22 years. Section 2 of this bill authorizes
15 the Commissioner of Insurance to require certain policies of insurance issued by a
16 domestic insurer to a person residing in another state to include such coverage.
17 Section 10 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner to suspend or revoke the
18 certificate of a health maintenance organization that fails to comply with the
19 requirements of section 8. The Commissioner would also be authorized under
20 existing law to take such action against other health insurers who fail to comply
21 with the requirements of sections 1, 3-7 and 11 of this bill. (NRS 680A.200)
22 Section 12 of this bill makes a conforming change to require the Director of the
23 Department of Health and Human Services to administer the provisions of section
24 15 in the same manner as other provisions relating to Medicaid.
