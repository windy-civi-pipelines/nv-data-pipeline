Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires public and private policies of health insurance regulated
2 under Nevada law to include certain coverage. (NRS 287.010, 287.04335,
3 422.2717-422.27248, 689A.04033-689A.0465, 689B.0303-689B.0379, 689C.1652-
4 689C.169, 689C.194-689C.195, 689C.425, 695A.184-695A.1875, 695A.265,
5 695B.1901-695B.1948, 695C.050, 695C.1691-695C.176, 695G.162-695G.177)
6 Existing law also requires employers to provide certain benefits for health care to
7 employees, including the coverage required of health insurers, if the employer
8 provides health benefits for its employees. (NRS 608.1555) Sections 1, 3-9, 11 and
9 13-15 of this bill require certain public and private policies of health insurance and
10 health care plans, including Medicaid, to include coverage for screening for and the
11 assessment and diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, fetal alcohol

– 2 –
12 spectrum disorders, intellectual disabilities and specific learning disabilities for
13 persons covered by the policy under the age of 18 years or, if enrolled in high
14 school, until the person reaches the age of 22 years. Section 2 of this bill authorizes
15 the Commissioner of Insurance to require certain policies of insurance issued by a
16 domestic insurer to a person residing in another state to include such coverage.
17 Section 10 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner to suspend or revoke the
18 certificate of a health maintenance organization that fails to comply with the
19 requirements of section 8. The Commissioner would also be authorized under
20 existing law to take such action against other health insurers who fail to comply
21 with the requirements of sections 1, 3-7 and 11 of this bill. (NRS 680A.200)
22 Section 12 of this bill makes a conforming change to require the Director of the
23 Department of Health and Human Services to administer the provisions of section
24 15 in the same manner as other provisions relating to Medicaid.

ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES)

Referred to Committee on Commerce and Labor
SUMMARY—Requires health insurance to cover certain
screenings, assessments and diagnoses.
(BDR 57-351)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
CONTAINS UNFUNDED MANDATE (§ 13)
(NOT REQUESTED BY AFFECTED LOCAL GOVERNMENT)
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to insurance; requiring certain health insurance to
include coverage for the screening, assessment and
diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, fetal
alcohol spectrum disorders, intellectual disabilities and
specific learning disabilities for certain persons;
establishing certain administrative sanctions for failure to
provide such coverage; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires public and private policies of health insurance regulated
2 under Nevada law to include certain coverage. (NRS 287.010, 287.04335,
3 422.2717-422.27248, 689A.04033-689A.0465, 689B.0303-689B.0379, 689C.1652-
4 689C.169, 689C.194-689C.195, 689C.425, 695A.184-695A.1875, 695A.265,
5 695B.1901-695B.1948, 695C.050, 695C.1691-695C.176, 695G.162-695G.177)
6 Existing law also requires employers to provide certain benefits for health care to
7 employees, including the coverage required of health insurers, if the employer
8 provides health benefits for its employees. (NRS 608.1555) Sections 1, 3-9, 11 and
9 13-15 of this bill require certain public and private policies of health insurance and
10 health care plans, including Medicaid, to include coverage for screening for and the
11 assessment and diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, fetal alcohol
-
*AB340*

– 2 –
12 spectrum disorders, intellectual disabilities and specific learning disabilities for
13 persons covered by the policy under the age of 18 years or, if enrolled in high
14 school, until the person reaches the age of 22 years. Section 2 of this bill authorizes
15 the Commissioner of Insurance to require certain policies of insurance issued by a
16 domestic insurer to a person residing in another state to include such coverage.
17 Section 10 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner to suspend or revoke the
18 certificate of a health maintenance organization that fails to comply with the
19 requirements of section 8. The Commissioner would also be authorized under
20 existing law to take such action against other health insurers who fail to comply
21 with the requirements of sections 1, 3-7 and 11 of this bill. (NRS 680A.200)
22 Section 12 of this bill makes a conforming change to require the Director of the
23 Department of Health and Human Services to administer the provisions of section
24 15 in the same manner as other provisions relating to Medicaid.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 689A of NRS is hereby amended by
2 adding thereto a new section to read as follows:
3 1. An insurer that issues a policy of health insurance shall
4 include in the policy coverage for screening for and the
5 assessment and diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity
6 disorder, fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, intellectual disabilities
7 and specific learning disabilities for insureds under the age of 18
8 years or, if enrolled in high school, until the insured reaches the
9 age of 22 years.
10 2. An insurer that issues a policy of health insurance must
11 ensure that the benefits required by subsection 1 are made
12 available to an insured through a provider of health care who
13 participates in the network plan of the insurer.
14 3. Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring an
15 insurer that issues a policy of health insurance to provide
16 reimbursement to a school for services delivered through school
17 services.
18 4. A policy of health insurance subject to the provisions of
19 this chapter which is delivered, issued for delivery or renewed on
20 or after January 1, 2026, has the legal effect of including the
21 coverage required by this section, and any provision of the policy
22 or renewal which is in conflict with this section is void.

24 (a) “Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder” has the meaning
25 ascribed to it in NRS 432B.0655.
26 (b) “Intellectual disability” has the meaning ascribed to it in

– 3 –
1 provided, in whole or in part, through a defined set of providers
2 under contract with the insurer. The term does not include an
3 arrangement for the financing of premiums.
4 (d) “Provider of health care” has the meaning ascribed to it in
5 NRS 629.031.
6 (e) “Specific learning disability” has the meaning ascribed to
7 it in NRS 388.417.
8 Sec. 2. NRS 689A.330 is hereby amended to read as follows:
9 689A.330 If any policy is issued by a domestic insurer for
10 delivery to a person residing in another state, and if the insurance
11 commissioner or corresponding public officer of that other state has
12 informed the Commissioner that the policy is not subject to approval
13 or disapproval by that officer, the Commissioner may by ruling
14 require that the policy meet the standards set forth in NRS 689A.030
15 to 689A.320, inclusive [.] , and section 1 of this act.
16 Sec. 3. Chapter 689B of NRS is hereby amended by adding
17 thereto a new section to read as follows:
18 1. An insurer that issues a policy of group health insurance
19 shall include in the policy coverage for screening for and the
