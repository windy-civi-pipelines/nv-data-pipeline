Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Section 1 of this bill establishes a procedure by which the superintendent of
2 schools of a school district or the Superintendent of Public Instruction is authorized
3 to modify, suspend or eliminate a requirement for a public school or school district
4 to report information or data that is redundant or duplicative or does not provide
5 information or data that is used by the Department of Education, the State Board of
6 Education or any other person or entity to support educational outcomes.
7 Existing law establishes a statewide system of accountability for public schools
8 that includes, without limitation, a method to annually rate each public school
9 based on the performance of the school and on whether each public school meets
10 the school achievement targets and performance targets established pursuant to the
11 statewide system of accountability. (NRS 385A.600) Sections 3-5 and 11 of this
12 bill establish a similar system of accountability for school districts in this State.
13 Section 6 of this bill establishes criteria and procedures for the Superintendent to
14 designate a school district as low-performing or underperforming. Section 13 of
15 this bill requires: (1) the Superintendent to place a school district designated as
16 underperforming on probation if the designation is based on certain findings related
17 to the performance of the board of trustees of the school district; and (2) such a
18 school district to submit to the Department a school district performance
19 improvement plan and a school board improvement plan. Section 14 of this bill
20 authorizes the Superintendent to take certain actions if the board of trustees of a
21 school district does not make adequate progress toward meeting the goals and
22 benchmarks necessary to improve the performance of the school district, including,
23 without limitation, state oversight of the governance of the school district by the
24 board of trustees. Section 15 of this bill requires: (1) the Superintendent to place a
25 school district designated as underperforming on probation if the designation was
26 based on certain findings relating to the performance of pupils within the school
27 district; and (2) such a school district to submit to the Superintendent a school
28 district performance improvement plan. Section 15 also establishes the actions that
29 the Superintendent is authorized to take if the school district does not make
30 adequate progress toward improving the performance of pupils in the school
31 district, including, without limitation, replacing the leadership of the school district,
32 reallocating school district resources to prioritize support for low-performing
33 schools and assuming state control over certain functions of the school district.
34 Section 7 of this bill establishes criteria for designating a public school as low-
35 performing, and sections 28-37 of this bill prescribe the actions that may be taken
36 with respect to a public school designated as low-performing or persistently
37 underperforming. Under section 28: (1) the Superintendent is required to place on
-
*AB584*
– 3 –
38 probation a public school designated as low-performing; (2) the principal of the
39 public school is required to submit to the Superintendent a school improvement
40 plan; (3) the Superintendent is authorized to appoint an independent school
41 improvement official to oversee and monitor the progress of the school; and (4) the
42 Superintendent is required to designate as persistently underperforming a public
43 school placed on probation that fails to make adequate progress toward improving
44 pupil performance. Section 29 requires the Superintendent to initiate a process for
45 state intervention to implement certain corrective measures for a school that is
46 designated as persistently underperforming. Section 30 establishes provisions
47 governing the corrective measure of replacing the principal and key members of the
48 staff of a school. Section 31 establishes provisions governing the corrective
49 measure of the direct management of a school by the Department, as implemented
50 by the Superintendent. Section 32 establishes provisions governing the corrective
51 measure of transferring management of a school to the city or county in which the
52 school is located. Section 33 establishes provisions governing the corrective
53 measure of the conversion of a school into a charter school. Section 34 establishes
54 provisions governing the corrective measure of the conversion of a school to an
55 innovation school, and section 35 provides for the creation of networks of such
56 innovation schools. Section 36 provides for the transfer of ownership and
57 possession or the leasing of school facilities of a public school that is subject to
58 certain corrective measures. Section 61 of this bill: (1) creates the Education
59 Service Center; (2) provides for the appointment of a governing body for the
60 Center; and (3) requires the Center to provide certain assistance and guidance to
61 public schools and school districts that are experiencing low performance.
62 Section 37 requires a school that is designated as low-performing for 3
63 consecutive years to be designated as chronically low-performing and provides for
64 expanded achievement options for the pupils attending the school, including,
65 without limitation, attending another public school in the school district, a charter
66 school or a private school that satisfies certain requirements. Section 38 of this bill
67 requires the State Treasurer to adopt regulations to establish and carry out the
68 Nevada Integrity in Academic Funding Program. Under section 38, to the extent
69 that money is available to carry out the Program, the State Treasurer is required to
70 create a Resources for Inspiring Student Excellence Account, or “RISE Account,”
71 which may be used by the parent or legal guardian of a qualified pupil to pay
72 certain qualified educational expenses associated with participating in an expanded
73 achievement option pursuant to section 37.
74 Existing law provides that on or before December 31 of each year, the board of
75 trustees of each school district and the sponsor of each charter school is required to
76 prepare for the immediately preceding school year a report of accountability
77 concerning the educational goals and objectives of the school district or charter
78 school. (NRS 385A.070) Section 8 of this bill revises the date on which the board
79 of trustees of a school district or sponsor of a charter is required to provide written
80 notice that the report is available on the Internet website maintained by the school
81 district or sponsor of the charter school. Section 9 of this bill requires such a report
82 to include applicable comparisons to pupils in other states.
83 Existing law: (1) creates the Education Stabilization Account as a reserve
84 account within the State Education Fund; (2) authorizes the transfer of money
85 between the Account and the Fund for certain purposes; and (3) provides that the
86 balance in the Account must not exceed 20 percent of the total of all appropriations
87 and authorizations from the Fund, excluding the Account, for the immediately
88 preceding fiscal year. (NRS 387.1213) Section 17 of this bill: (1) creates the
89 Excellence in Education Account in the State Education Fund; (2) establishes the
90 maximum amount of money that may be in the Excellence in Education Account;
91 and (3) provides for the transfer of money to the Excellence in Education Account
92 under certain circumstances. Under section 17, money in the Excellence in
-

– 4 –
93 Education Account must be used only to make grants of money to school districts,
94 charter schools and university schools for profoundly gifted pupils to provide
95 nonrecurring incentives to school administrators, teachers and other educational
96 personnel, including, without limitation, to pay incentives to school administrators
97 and teachers pursuant to any program established pursuant to section 59 or 60 of
98 this bill. Section 18 of this bill: (1) makes conforming changes to provisions
99 of existing law governing the Education Stabilization Account to reflect the transfer
100 of certain money to the Excellence in Education Account; and (2) requires money
101 in the Education Stabilization Account to be transferred to the Department to
102 undertake certain measures to oversee or allocate resources to a school district that
103 is designated as low-performing or underperforming pursuant to section 6 or a
104 school that is designated as low-performing pursuant to section 7 or persistently
105 underperforming pursuant to section 28.
106 As part of the Pupil-Centered Funding Plan, existing law requires money in
107 each fiscal year to be appropriated to each school district to provide transportation
108 for pupils. (NRS 387.1214) Section 19 of this bill additionally authorizes a charter
109 school to receive money to provide transportation for pupils if the provision of
110 transportation for pupils is authorized in the charter contract entered into by the
111 governing body of the charter school and the sponsor of the charter school.
112 Existing law creates the Commission on School Funding and establishes the
113 duties of the Commission. (NRS 387.1246, 387.12463) Section 20 of this bill
114 requires the Commission to review the process of adjusting school funding
115 allocations based on the count of weighted pupil groups and evaluate alternatives
116 for making those adjustments. Under existing law, any recommendations resulting
117 from such a review are required to be presented to the Joint Interim Standing
118 Committee on Education, and after consideration by the Committee, the
119 Commission is required to transmit the recommendations to the Governor and the
120 Legislature. (NRS 387.12463)
121 Existing law: (1) authorizes the board of trustees of certain school districts to
122 zone the school district and determine which pupils must attend each school; and
123 (2) allows pupils to attend certain schools despite the zoning decision of the board
124 of trustees. (NRS 388.040) Section 22 of this bill provides for the implementation
125 of a system of open enrollment managed by each school district pursuant to which
126 the parent or legal guardian of a pupil may apply for the pupil to attend a school
127 outside of the zone of attendance in which the pupil resides. Section 39 of this bill
128 makes a conforming change to authorize a pupil to attend a public school outside of
129 the zone of attendance in which the pupil resides if the pupil is selected to attend a
130 different public school under the system of open enrollment. Section 23 of this bill
131 requires the school district to provide transportation services, or subsidize
132 transportation services, for a pupil who is attending or is zoned to attend a school
133 designated as low-performing pursuant to section 7 and who is selected to attend a
134 different school under the system of open enrollment. Section 16 of this bill
135 authorizes the board of trustees of a school district that furnishes transportation to
136 pupils to elect not to provide transportation to a pupil who attends a public school
137 outside of his or her zone of attendance pursuant to section 22, unless the school
138 district is required to provide transportation to such a pupil pursuant to section 23.
139 Section 24 of this bill requires the Department to monitor the system of open
140 enrollment, collect data and prepare certain reports concerning the system.
141 Existing law requires an elementary school to provide intervention services and
142 intensive instruction to a pupil during the time the pupil attends the school if the
143 pupil does not obtain a score in the subject area of reading on the criterion-
144 referenced examination in reading that meets the score prescribed by the State
145 Board. (NRS 388A.487, 392.760) Sections 25-27 of this bill provide for the
146 creation by each school district of a Parent-Selected Intervention Options Program
147 under which the parent or legal guardian of a pupil who is required to be provided
-
*AB584*
– 5 –
148 such intervention services and intensive instruction may receive a grant of money
149 from the school district to pay the expenses of literacy interventions, tutoring and
150 other related services. Section 25 establishes the Empowering Parents Account in
151 the State Education Fund and requires $1,000,000 per fiscal year, or such greater
152 amount as may be appropriated by the Legislature, to be transferred from the State
153 Education Fund to the Account for the purpose of making distributions to school
154 districts for the Program. Section 26 requires each school district to establish the
155 Program and establishes an order of priority for making grants under the Program
156 based on the adjusted gross income of the household in which the pupil resides.
157 Section 27 requires: (1) a service provider to register with the school district to be
158 eligible to provide literacy intervention, tutoring and related services to pupils
159 under the Program; and (2) such services to be evidence-based and to meet certain
160 criteria. Section 10 of this bill requires the statewide system of accountability for
161 public schools to include, for elementary schools, the proportion of pupils
162 demonstrating adequate proficiency in the subject area of reading and adequate
163 progress to achieving such proficiency.
164 Existing law: (1) authorizes certain entities, including, without limitation, a city
165 or county, to sponsor charter schools; and (2) prohibits a city or county from
166 sponsoring a new charter school or expanding the enrollment or operating an
167 additional campus of an existing charter school sponsored by the city or county if
168 the total number of pupils enrolled in the charter schools sponsored by the city or
169 county exceeds a certain percentage of the pupils enrolled in public schools in the
170 city or county other than in charter schools not sponsored by the city or county.
171 (NRS 388A.220) Section 40 of this bill creates an exception to this prohibition by
172 authorizing a city or county to sponsor a new charter school or expand the
173 enrollment or operate an additional campus of an existing charter school sponsored
174 by the city or county, regardless of the number of pupils that will be enrolled in the
175 charter schools sponsored by the city or county, if: (1) the city or county is in a
176 school district that is designated as low-performing pursuant to section 6; and (2)
177 the new charter school or increase in enrollment or additional campus of the
178 existing charter school will serve pupils who reside in the zone of attendance of a
179 public school that is designated as low-performing pursuant to section 7 or
180 persistently underperforming pursuant to section 28 or is overcrowded.
181 Existing law: (1) designates certain academic subjects, including English
182 language arts, as core academic subjects that must be taught in all public schools;
183 and (2) requires the Council to Establish Academic Standards for Public Schools to
184 adopt standards of content and performance for certain courses of study, including
185 courses in the core academic subjects. (NRS 389.018, 389.520) Section 44 of this
186 bill requires the standards for English language arts in kindergarten and grades 1, 2
187 and 3 to include phonics-based instruction and to integrate science, technology,
188 engineering and mathematics into instruction in English language arts. Section 42
189 of this bill requires the Department, to the extent that money is available for such a
190 purpose, to establish a pilot program under which schools or groups of schools may
191 apply to the Department for grants to integrate science, technology, engineering and
192 mathematics into instruction in literacy. Section 43 of this bill requires the model
193 curriculum for English language arts, which the State Board is required to develop
194 under existing law, to include phonics-based instruction and the integration of
195 science, technology, engineering and mathematics into English language arts in
196 kindergarten and grades 1, 2 and 3. Under existing law, such a model curriculum is
197 required to be distributed to public schools for use by teachers and administrators in
198 developing class lesson plans and to the governing bodies of regional training
199 programs for the professional development of teachers and administrators for use in
200 the provision of training to teachers and administrators. (NRS 389.026)
201 Section 46 of this bill provides that a school employee is immune from civil
202 and criminal liability for actions taken in good faith to intervene in physical
-
*AB584*
– 6 –
203 altercations, fights or other incidents that pose an imminent risk to the safety of
204 pupils or staff if: (1) the school employee is acting within the course and scope of
205 his or her employment and within the course and scope of his or her role in
206 maintaining order, discipline or the safety of pupils; (2) the actions of the school
207 employee are consistent with state, federal and local laws and the policies of the
208 school district or school at which the school employee is employed; and (3) any
209 harm caused by the intervention is not the result of intentional, willful, grossly
210 negligent or reckless misconduct or a conscious and flagrant indifference to the
211 rights or safety of the person harmed. Section 64 of this bill applies this immunity
212 from civil and criminal liability to employees of private schools.
213 Existing law requires the Commission on Professional Standards in Education
214 to adopt regulations prescribing the qualifications for licensing teachers and other
215 educational personnel, including regulations governing examinations for the initial
216 licensing of teachers and other educational personnel and the procedures for the
217 issuance and renewal of those licenses. (NRS 391.019, 391.021) Under existing
218 regulations, a license to teach elementary education authorizes the holder to teach
219 all subjects in elementary grades. (NAC 391.090) Sections 53-55 of this bill require
220 the Commission to adopt regulations requiring that, to be eligible to teach pupils in
221 kindergarten or grade 1, 2 or 3 on or after July 1, 2028, a teacher is required to
222 obtain an endorsement to teach such pupils by successfully completing a course of
223 instruction in foundational literacy skills that is approved by the Commission and
224 meets certain standards. Section 65 of this bill authorizes the Board of Regents of
225 the University of Nevada to require certain institutions within the System to
226 collaborate with the Department and the Commission to establish such courses of
227 instruction at the institutions.
228 Existing law requires a postprobationary employee of a school district whose
229 performance is designated as developing or ineffective for 2 consecutive years to
230 serve an additional probationary period. (NRS 391.730) Under existing law: (1) a
231 period of probation is for three 1-year periods and a probationary employee has no
232 right to employment after any of the three probationary contract years; and (2)
233 during the contract year, the probationary employee may be dismissed after
234 receiving notice and an opportunity for a hearing. (NRS 391.820-391.826) Section
235 56 of this bill provides that if a postprobationary employee is serving an additional
236 probationary period under existing law and the postprobationary employee receives
237 a rating of ineffective for 2 consecutive years during that additional probationary
238 period: (1) the board of trustees of the school district may notify the employee that
239 the employee will not be reemployed for the next contract year; or (2) the
240 superintendent of the school district may initiate the process of dismissing the
241 employee during a contract year. Under section 56, if a school district does not
242 reemploy or dismisses such an employee, the Department is required to provide: (1)
243 the school district with certain assistance in recruiting and hiring a highly effective
244 administrator to fill any vacancy created; and (2) school leadership with access to
245 certain coaching to assist the school leadership in managing transitions and
246 improving teaching practices.
247 Section 52 of this bill authorizes a postprobationary teacher to be placed on a
248 period of probation of 2 school years if the evaluations of the postprobationary
249 teacher have consistently rated the postprobationary teacher as ineffective in certain
250 areas. If a postprobationary teacher is placed on such a period of probation, a
251 performance improvement plan must be established for the postprobationary
252 teacher pursuant to section 51 of this bill. Under section 52, at the conclusion of
253 the period of probation pursuant to that section, the postprobationary teacher must
254 be evaluated. If, based on that evaluation, the teacher has not made adequate
255 progress toward meeting improvement goals, section 52 authorizes the teacher to
256 not be reemployed or to be dismissed in the same manner as a probationary
257 employee.

258 Sections 47 and 48 of this bill enact provisions for administrators similar to
259 sections 51 and 52. Section 49 of this bill provides that if the principal of a public
260 school in a large school district, as defined in existing law, (currently only Clark
261 County School District) receives a rating of ineffective or minimally effective, or is
262 placed on probation pursuant to section 48, the Superintendent of Public Instruction
263 is authorized to suspend or modify certain site-based decision-making authority of
264 the school organizational team. (NRS 388G.500-388G.810) Section 50 of this bill
265 requires the Department to track certain data relating to the effectiveness of
266 programs that provide training for school administrators, assess the effectiveness of
267 such programs and make recommendations for the improvement of such programs.
268 Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district and the
269 governing body of each charter school to ensure that teachers employed by the
270 school district or charter school have access to certain professional development
271 training. (NRS 391A.370) Under existing law, a program of professional
272 development training provided by regional training programs is required to include,
273 without limitation, training in methods to teach fundamental reading skills for
274 teachers who teach kindergarten and grades 1, 2 and 3. (NRS 391A.125) Section 58
275 of this bill requires the board of trustees of each school district and the governing
276 body of each charter school to ensure that teachers who teach pupils in kindergarten
277 and grades 1, 2 and 3, administrators of schools in which such pupils are enrolled,
278 certain other administrators and paraprofessionals who directly serve such pupils
279 complete a course of professional development training in the science of reading
280 that is approved by the Department.
281 Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district to establish a
282 program of performance pay and enhanced compensation for the recruitment and
283 retention of licensed teachers and administrators. The program is required to have
284 as its primary focus improvement in the academic achievement of pupils and
285 implementation in at-risk schools and schools receiving the lowest rating possible
286 indicating underperformance of a public school. (NRS 391A.450) Under the
287 program: (1) the board of trustees of each school district is required to reserve, for
288 each fiscal year, an amount of money sufficient to provide an increase in base
289 salaries, not including monetary benefits, for at least 5 percent of the teachers and
290 administrators employed by the school district; and (2) the amount of the increase
291 must not exceed 10 percent of the annual base salary of each teacher and
292 administrator to whom the increase is paid. (NRS 391A.455) Section 59 provides
293 that if, at any time, the proportion of administrators in a school district, charter
294 school or network of charter schools whose performance evaluation is highly
295 effective is 85 percent or less for 2 consecutive school years, the board of trustees
296 of a school district or the sponsor of a charter school is authorized to establish a
297 program to pay one-time incentives in an amount not to exceed 10 percent of the
298 annual base salary of administrators who achieve a performance rating of highly
299 effective for 5 consecutive years. Section 60 authorizes the board of trustees of a
300 school district or the sponsor of a charter school to establish a similar program for
301 teachers who achieve a performance rating of highly effective for 3 consecutive
302 years.
303 Sections 66-68 of this bill make appropriations to carry out the provisions of
304 this bill.

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 385 of NRS is hereby amended by adding
2 thereto a new section to read as follows:
3 1. It is the intent of the Legislature to:
4 (a) Enhance the efficiency of education reporting
5 requirements by eliminating the reporting of redundant
6 information and data, reducing administrative burdens and
7 ensuring that all reports serve a meaningful purpose in supporting
8 educational outcomes.
9 (b) Ensure that teachers and school administrators, who are
10 directly impacted by reporting requirements, have agency in
11 recommending modifications to reporting requirements.
12 (c) Preserve transparency, the accountability of public schools
13 and school districts for the quality of schools and the educational
14 achievement of pupils, and the accessibility of information and
15 data concerning the educational achievement of pupils.
16 2. A teacher or school administrator employed at a public
17 school, a charter management organization that operates a
18 charter school or an educational management organization that
19 provides support or operations to a charter school may submit a
20 petition to modify, suspend or eliminate a requirement for a public
21 school or school district to report information or data to another
22 person or entity. Such a petition must be submitted to the
23 superintendent of schools of the school district in which the public
24 school is located or, if the public school is a charter school, the
25 governing body of the charter school. The petition must:
26 (a) Clearly identify the requirement to report information or
27 data that the petitioner is seeking to modify, suspend or eliminate;
28 (b) Contain a detailed explanation of the reason that the
29 requirement to report information or data is duplicative or
30 redundant or does not provide information or data that is used by
31 the Department, the State Board or any other person or entity to
32 support educational outcomes; and
33 (c) Propose an alternative report of information or data, if any,
34 that would ensure that information and data to support
35 educational outcomes remains accessible.
36 3. Upon receipt of a petition submitted pursuant to subsection
37 2, the superintendent of schools of the school district or governing
38 body of the charter school, as applicable, shall:
39 (a) Review the petition to determine whether the requirement
40 to report data or information that is proposed for modification,
41 suspension or elimination is duplicative or redundant or does not
42 provide data or information that is used by the Department, the
-
*AB584*
– 9 –
1 State Board or any other person or entity to support educational
2 outcomes.
3 (b) If the petition requests to modify, suspend or eliminate a
4 requirement for a public school to report data or information to
5 the school district and the superintendent of schools of the school
6 district finds that the requirement to report data or information
7 proposed for modification, suspension or elimination is duplicative
8 or redundant or does not provide data that is used by the school
9 district to support educational outcomes, approve the petition and
10 issue a decision modifying, eliminating or suspending the
11 requirement. If the superintendent of schools of the school district
12 issues such a decision, the superintendent shall provide notice of
13 the approval of the petition to the petitioner, each public school
14 within the school district and any other person or entity affected
15 by the modification, suspension or elimination of the reporting
16 requirement. If the superintendent of public schools of the school
17 district denies a petition to modify, suspend or eliminate a
18 requirement for a public school to report data or information to
19 the school district, the superintendent shall provide a written
20 explanation of the reasons for the denial to the petitioner. A
21 petitioner whose petition is denied pursuant to this paragraph may
22 submit a request for reconsideration of the denial to the
23 superintendent of schools of the school district or resubmit the

17 act.
18 Sec. 3. 1. The Department shall make every effort to ensure
19 that the statewide system of accountability for public schools

21 with all requirements for the accountability of public schools,
22 including, without limitation, requirements for the receipt of
23 federal money under the Elementary and Secondary Education
24 Act of 1965, 20 U.S.C. §§ 6301 et seq., as amended.
25 2. The statewide system of accountability for public schools
26 applies to all school districts in this State, regardless of size or
27 demographics, and must, except as otherwise provided in
28 subsection 3 of section 5 of this act:
29 (a) Include a method to, on an annual basis, rate each school
30 district based upon the collective performance of the public
31 schools within the school district and the achievement of district-
32 wide performance targets established pursuant to the statewide
33 system of accountability for public schools;
34 (b) Include a method to implement consequences, rewards and
35 supports for school districts based upon such ratings, with a focus

44 performance targets for specific groups of pupils, including,
45 without limitation, pupils who are economically disadvantaged,
-
*AB584*
– 13 –
1 pupils from major racial and ethnic groups, pupils with disabilities
2 and pupils who are English learners. The district-wide
3 achievement targets and performance targets must be based on
4 aggregated metrics from the public schools within the school
5 district, including, without limitation, measurements of the
6 progress and proficiency of pupils on the examinations
7 administered pursuant to NRS 390.105.
8 3. The statewide system of accountability for public schools

12 achievement in school districts throughout this State;
13 (b) Provide for the monitoring and oversight of the operations
14 of, and allocation of resources by, school districts for the purpose
15 of improving pupil outcomes; and

18 accountability metrics and a detailed analysis of the progress of
19 each school district toward its district-wide achievement targets.
20 4. In developing the statewide system of accountability for
21 public schools required by this section, including, without
22 limitation, the achievement and performance targets for school
23 districts and the criteria used to rate each school district, the
24 Department shall meaningfully consult with the parents and
25 guardians of pupils enrolled in public schools in this State.
26 5. The Department shall provide technical assistance and
27 guidance to school districts to support compliance with the
28 statewide system of accountability for public schools and to
29 address deficiencies identified through the rating process.

31 Superintendent of Public Instruction, but not later than the third
32 Friday in August of each year, the Department shall determine
33 whether each school district is meeting the district-wide

35 to the statewide system of accountability for public schools.
36 2. The determination for a school district must be made
37 pursuant to subsection 1 in consultation with the board of trustees
38 of the school district and must be based only upon the information
39 and data for those pupils who are enrolled in the public schools
40 within the school district for a full academic year. On or before a
41 date determined by the Superintendent of Public Instruction, but
42 not later than the third Friday in August of each year, the

8 enrolled in a public school in a school district is insufficient to
9 yield statistically reliable information:
10 (a) The Department shall not determine that the school district
11 has failed to meet the performance targets established pursuant to
12 the statewide system of accountability for public schools based
13 solely upon that particular group.
14 (b) The pupils in such a group must be included in the overall
15 count of pupils enrolled in the public schools in the school district
16 and who took the examinations administered pursuant to
17 NRS 390.105.
18  The Department shall use the mechanism approved by the
19 United States Department of Education for the statewide system of
20 accountability for public schools for determining the number of
21 pupils that must be in a group for that group to yield statistically
22 reliable information.
23 4. If an irregularity in testing administration or an
24 irregularity in testing security occurs at one or more public
25 schools in the school district and the irregularity invalidates the
26 test scores of pupils, such test scores must be included in the
27 aggregate of scores reported for the school district, the attendance
28 of those pupils must be counted toward the total number of pupils
29 who took the examinations administered pursuant to NRS 390.105
30 and the pupils must be included in the total number of pupils who
31 were required to take the examinations. The determination made
32 pursuant to subsection 1 for a school district must reflect any such
33 irregularity and describe the impact of any such irregularity on
34 the determination.

20 consultants to address specific challenges identified during the
21 review; and
22 (5) Evaluating the feasibility of school district
23 restructuring, including, without limitation, the reorganization
24 and restructuring of the school district.
25 13. If the Superintendent of Public Instruction takes any
26 action authorized pursuant to paragraph (b) of subsection 12, the
27 Department shall continue to engage with community
28 stakeholders, including, without limitation, parents, teachers and
29 local leaders, to provide regular updates on intervention efforts
30 and to ensure alignment with the needs of pupils and the broader
31 community. Any actions taken pursuant to paragraph (b) of
32 subsection 12, including, without limitation, documentation of the
33 performance deficiencies of the school district, the steps taken to
34 address those deficiencies, progress made during the intervention
35 period and recommendations for additional measures to achieve
36 sustained improvement, must be reported by the Superintendent to
37 the:

*AB584*
– 37 –
1 maximum balance in the Account calculated pursuant to this
2 subsection for the immediately preceding fiscal year by the rate of
3 inflation, as defined in NRS 387.12455.

15 priority:
16 (a) Any money that would otherwise remain in the State
17 Education Fund pursuant to subsection 7 of NRS 387.1213
18 because the balance in the Education Stabilization Account has

20 must be transferred to the Excellence in Education Account.
21 (b) Any money that would otherwise be transferred from a
22 county school district fund to the Education Stabilization Account
23 pursuant to subsection 1 of NRS 387.1213 but is not transferred to

27 Excellence in Education Account.
28 (c) Any interest earned on the money in the Education
29 Stabilization Account pursuant to subsection 1 of NRS 387.1213
30 must be transferred to the Excellence in Education Account.

44 bonuses or financial awards, to teachers, school administrators
45 and other educational personnel who demonstrate high
-

– 38 –
1 performance and significant contributions to pupil achievement
2 and school improvement. If the board of trustees of a school
3 district or the sponsor of a charter school or university school for
4 profoundly gifted pupils has established a program to pay
5 incentives to teachers or school administrators pursuant to section
6 59 or 60 of this act, or both. Money in the Excellence in Education
7 Account must be granted to the boards of trustees of such school
8 districts and the sponsors of charter schools or university schools
9 for profoundly gifted pupils to pay incentives under the program.
10 Eighty-five percent of the money in the Excellence in Education
11 Account must be designated to pay incentives to teachers, and 15
12 percent of the money in the Excellence in Education Account
13 must be designated to pay incentives to school administrators.
14 Money in the Excellence in Education Account, or money from a
15 grant awarded from the Excellence in Education Account, may
16 not be used to pay recurring expenses or administrative expenses.
17 8. On or before November 1 of each even-numbered year, the

19 pursuant to subsection 7 and submit the report to the Governor,
20 the State Board and the Director of the Legislative Counsel
21 Bureau for transmittal to the next regular session of the
22 Legislature.
23 Sec. 18. NRS 387.1213 is hereby amended to read as follows:
24 387.1213 1. The Education Stabilization Account is hereby
25 created in the State Education Fund. Except as otherwise provided
26 in this section [,] and section 17 of this act, each year after the close
27 of the previous fiscal year and before the issuance of the State
28 Controller’s annual report, each county school district shall transfer
29 from the county school district fund to the Education Stabilization
30 Account any amount by which the actual ending fund balance of the
31 county school district fund exceeds 16.6 percent of the total actual
32 expenditures for the fund. [The] Except as otherwise provided in
33 section 17 of this act, the interest and income earned on the money
34 in the Account, after deducting any applicable charges, must be
35 credited to the Account.
36 2. Money transferred pursuant to subsection 1 to the Education
37 Stabilization Account is a continuing appropriation solely for the
38 purpose of authorizing the expenditure of the transferred money for
39 the purposes set forth in this section.

41 exceed 20 percent of the total of all appropriations and
42 authorizations from the State Education Fund, excluding the
43 Education Stabilization Account, for the immediately preceding
44 fiscal year. Any money transferred to the Education Stabilization
-
*AB584*
– 39 –
1 Account which exceeds this amount must instead be transferred to
2 the State Education Fund.
3 4. If the Interim Finance Committee finds that:
4 (a) Upon submission of a request from the Department, the
5 actual enrollment growth for a fiscal year exceeds the projected
6 enrollment growth by an amount that the Interim Finance
7 Committee determines would make a transfer of money to the State
8 Education Fund necessary to fund the excess enrollment;
9 (b) The collection of revenue in any fiscal year will result in the
10 State Education Fund receiving less money than authorized for
11 expenditure from the State Education Fund;
12 (c) Upon submission of a request from the Department, any
13 amount of money which was deposited in the State Education Fund
14 is found by an audit to have been deposited in error; [or]
15 (d) Upon submission of a request from the Department, any
16 error in the application of the Pupil-Centered Funding Plan by the
17 Department has created a shortfall in the State Education Fund [,] ;
18 or
19 (e) Upon submission of a request from the Department, the
20 Department is required to undertake extraordinary measures to
21 oversee or allocate resources to a school district that is designated
22 as a low-performing school district or underperforming school
23 district pursuant to section 6 of this act or a public school that is
24 designated as a low-performing school pursuant to section 7 of
25 this act or as persistently underperforming pursuant to subsection
26 6 of section 28 of this act,
27  the Committee shall by resolution establish an amount of money
28 to transfer from the Education Stabilization Account to the State
29 Education Fund and direct the State Controller to transfer that
30 amount to the State Education Fund. The State Controller shall
31 thereupon make the transfer.
32 5. When determining the actual ending fund balance for the
33 purposes of subsection 1, each county school district shall exclude:
34 (a) Any money deposited in the county school district fund on or
35 before June 30, 2020;
36 (b) Any money apportioned to the county school district for
37 capital projects or debt service pursuant to subsection 2 of NRS
38 362.170 and deposited in the county school district fund when

40 (c) Any money transferred to the county school district and
41 authorized for expenditure as a continuing appropriation pursuant to
42 paragraph (b) of subsection 6 of NRS 387.1214.

44 the money due from the State Education Fund to a county school
45 district, charter school or university school for profoundly gifted
-
*AB584*
– 40 –
1 pupils pursuant to NRS 387.185 exceeds the amount of money
2 available in the State Education Fund because of a delay in expected
3 receipts, he or she may request from the Director of the Office of
4 Finance a temporary advance from the Education Stabilization
5 Account for the payment of such money due. Upon receipt of such a
6 request, the Director of the Office of Finance shall make a
7 recommendation to the Interim Finance Committee to approve the
8 temporary advance in whole or in part or to deny the request. If the
9 Interim Finance Committee approves the request in whole or in part,
10 the Director of the Office of Finance shall notify the State Controller
11 and the Fiscal Analysis Division of the Legislative Counsel Bureau
12 of the amount approved by the Interim Finance Committee, and the
13 State Controller shall draw his or her warrant upon receipt of such a
14 notice of approval. Any money which is temporarily advanced from
15 the Education Stabilization Account pursuant to this subsection
16 must be repaid by August 31 following the end of the fiscal year in
17 which the temporary advance is made.
18 7. [The] Except as otherwise provided in section 17 of this
19 act, the balance remaining in the State Education Fund, excluding
20 the balance remaining in the Education Stabilization Account, that
21 has not been committed for expenditure on or before June 30 of an
22 odd-numbered fiscal year must be transferred to the Education
23 Stabilization Account to the extent that such a transfer would not
24 cause the balance in the Education Stabilization Account to exceed
25 the limit established in subsection 3.
26 Sec. 19. NRS 387.1214 is hereby amended to read as follows:
27 387.1214 1. After a direct legislative appropriation is made to
28 the State Education Fund from the State General Fund pursuant to
29 NRS 387.1212, the Legislature shall determine the statewide base
30 per pupil funding amount for each fiscal year of the biennium,
31 which is the amount of money expressed on a per pupil basis for the
32 projected enrollment of the public schools in this State, determined
33 to be sufficient by the Legislature to fund the costs of all public
34 schools in this State to operate and provide general education to all
35 pupils for any purpose for which specific funding is not
36 appropriated pursuant to paragraph (a), (b) , (c) or [(e)] (f) of
37 subsection 2 or NRS 387.122. It is the intent of the Legislature that
38 the statewide base per pupil funding amount for any fiscal year, to
39 the extent practicable, be not less than the statewide base per pupil
40 funding amount for the immediately preceding fiscal year, adjusted
41 by the rate of inflation, unless the amount of money contained in the
42 State Education Fund, excluding the Education Stabilization
43 Account, decreases from the preceding fiscal year. If the amount of
44 money contained in the State Education Fund, excluding the
45 Education Stabilization Account, decreases from the preceding
-
*AB584*
– 41 –
1 fiscal year, it is the intent of the Legislature that a proportional
2 reduction be made in both the statewide base per pupil funding
3 amount and the weighted funding appropriated pursuant to
4 paragraph [(e)] (f) of subsection 2.
5 2. After a direct legislative appropriation is made to the State
6 Education Fund from the State General Fund pursuant to NRS
7 387.1212, the money in the State Education Fund, excluding any
8 amount of money in the Education Stabilization Account, must be
9 appropriated as established by law for each fiscal year of the
10 biennium for the following purposes:
11 (a) To each school district, an amount of money determined to
12 be sufficient by the Legislature, when combined with any other
13 resources available for this purpose, to provide food services [and
14 transportation] for pupils and any other similar service that the
15 Legislature deems appropriate.
16 (b) To each school district and charter school authorized
17 under its charter contract, as defined in NRS 388A.015, to offer
18 transportation for pupils, an amount of money determined to be
19 sufficient by the Legislature, when combined with any other
20 resources available for this purpose, to provide transportation for
21 pupils.
22 (c) To each school district, charter school or university school
23 for profoundly gifted pupils, an amount of money determined to be
24 sufficient by the Legislature, when combined with any other
25 resources available for this purpose, to provide local funding to
26 support pupils with disabilities.
27 [(c)] (d) To each school district, an amount of money
28 determined to be sufficient by the Legislature, when combined with
29 any other resources available for this purpose, to provide adjusted
30 base per pupil funding for each pupil estimated to be enrolled in the
31 school district.
32 [(d)] (e) To each charter school or university school for
33 profoundly gifted pupils, an amount of money determined to be
34 sufficient by the Legislature, when combined with any other
35 resources available for this purpose, to provide:
36 (1) The statewide base per pupil funding amount for each
37 pupil estimated to be enrolled full-time in a program of distance
38 education provided by the charter school or university school for
39 profoundly gifted pupils; and
40 (2) Adjusted base per pupil funding for each pupil estimated
41 to be enrolled in the charter school or university school for
42 profoundly gifted pupils other than a pupil identified in
43 subparagraph (1).
44 [(e)] (f) To each school district, charter school or university
45 school for profoundly gifted pupils, an amount of money determined
-
*AB584*
– 42 –
1 to be sufficient by the Legislature, when combined with any other
2 resources available for this purpose, to provide additional weighted
3 funding for each pupil estimated to be enrolled in the school district,
4 charter school or university school for profoundly gifted pupils who
5 is:
6 (1) An English learner;
7 (2) An at-risk pupil; or
8 (3) A gifted and talented pupil.
9 3. The adjusted base per pupil funding appropriated pursuant to
10 paragraph [(c)] (d) of subsection 2 for each school district must be
11 determined by applying the cost adjustment factor established
12 pursuant to NRS 387.1215 which applies to the school district and
13 the attendance area adjustment established pursuant to NRS
14 387.1218 which applies to each applicable area of the school district
15 to the statewide base per pupil funding amount.
16 4. The adjusted base per pupil funding appropriated pursuant to
17 subparagraph (2) of paragraph [(d)] (e) of subsection 2 for each
18 charter school or university school for profoundly gifted pupils must
19 be determined by applying the cost adjustment factor established
20 pursuant to NRS 387.1215 which applies to the charter school or
21 university school and, if applicable, the attendance area adjustment
22 established pursuant to NRS 387.1218 to the statewide base per
23 pupil funding amount.
24 5. The weighted funding appropriated pursuant to paragraph
25 [(e)] (f) of subsection 2 must be established separately for each
26 category of pupils identified in that paragraph and expressed as a
27 multiplier to be applied to the statewide base per pupil funding
28 amount determined pursuant to subsection 1. A pupil who belongs
29 to more than one category of pupils or for whom a school district,
30 charter school or university school for profoundly gifted pupils is
31 eligible to receive the statewide multiplier pursuant to NRS 387.122
32 must receive only the weighted funding for the single category to
33 which the pupil belongs which has the largest multiplier or the
34 statewide multiplier, whichever is larger. It is the intent of the
35 Legislature that, to the extent practicable:
36 (a) The multiplier for each category of pupils for any fiscal year
37 be not less than the multiplier for the immediately preceding fiscal
38 year unless:
39 (1) The amount of money contained in the State Education
40 Fund, excluding the Education Stabilization Account, decreases
41 from the preceding fiscal year, in which event it is the intent of the
42 Legislature that a proportional reduction be made in both the
43 statewide base per pupil funding amount and the weighted funding
44 appropriated pursuant to paragraph [(e)] (f) of subsection 2; or
-
*AB584*
– 43 –
1 (2) The amount of money contained in the State Education
2 Fund, excluding the Education Stabilization Account, increases
3 from the preceding fiscal year but in an amount which, after funding
4 the appropriations required by paragraphs (a) to [(d),] (e), inclusive,
5 of subsection 2, is insufficient to fund the multiplier for each
6 category of pupils, in which event it is the intent of the Legislature
7 that the remaining money in the State Education Fund be used to
8 provide a multiplier for each category of pupils which is as close as
9 practicable to the multiplier for the preceding fiscal year;
10 (b) The recommendations of the Commission for the multiplier
11 for each category of pupils be considered and the multiplier for one
12 category of pupils may be changed by an amount that is not
13 proportional to the change in the multiplier for one or more other
14 categories of pupils if the Legislature determines that a
15 disproportionate need to serve the pupils in the affected category
16 exists; and
17 (c) If the multipliers for all categories of pupils in a fiscal year
18 are increased from the multipliers in the immediately preceding
19 fiscal year, a proportional increase is considered for the statewide
20 base per pupil funding amount.
21 6. For any money identified in subsection 4 of NRS 362.170
22 which is deposited to the credit of the State Education Fund:
23 (a) The amount of such money for the county from which the
24 money was collected that does not exceed the total amount of
25 money appropriated pursuant to subsection 2 to the county school
26 district is deemed to be the first money appropriated pursuant to
27 subsection 2 for that county school district and the first money spent
28 by that county school district from the county school district fund
29 during the applicable fiscal year.
30 (b) The amount of such money for the county from which the
31 money was collected which exceeds the total amount of money
32 appropriated pursuant to subsection 2 to the county school district
33 must be transferred to the county school district and is hereby
34 authorized for expenditure as a continuing appropriation for the
35 purpose of mitigating the adverse effects of the cyclical nature of
36 the industry of extracting and processing minerals on the ability of
37 the county school district to offer its pupils a reasonably equal
38 educational opportunity.
39 7. The weighted funding appropriated pursuant to paragraph
40 [(e)] (f) of subsection 2:
41 (a) May not be used to settle or arbitrate disputes between a
42 recognized organization representing employees of a school district
43 or the governing body of a charter school and the school district or
44 governing body or to settle any negotiations; and
-
*AB584*
– 44 –
1 (b) May not be used to adjust the district-wide schedules of
2 salaries and benefits of the employees of a school district.
3 8. As used in this section, “rate of inflation” has the meaning
4 ascribed to it in NRS 387.12455.
5 Sec. 20. NRS 387.12463 is hereby amended to read as
6 follows:
7 387.12463 1. The Commission shall:

42 a pupil in a school district may attend any public school in that
43 school district, regardless of the zone of attendance in which the
44 pupil resides. The Department shall oversee the transition to a
45 system of open enrollment for school districts in this State by
-
*AB584*
– 48 –
1 providing school districts with guidance, support and resources to
2 ensure pupils and their parents or legal guardians are informed of
3 the option to participate in the system of open enrollment. The
4 provision of guidance, support and resources pursuant to this
5 subsection may include, without limitation, the creation of a
6 centralized system for the selection of public schools to facilitate
7 the application, ranking and enrollment process for pupils
8 throughout the State.
9 2. Each school district shall adopt a uniform methodology for
10 calculating the capacity of each public school within the school
11 district for the purposes of open enrollment. The methodology
12 must be documented, applied consistently across all public schools
13 within the school district and made available on the Internet
14 website maintained by the school district. The calculation of the
15 capacity of each public school within the school district for the
16 purposes of open enrollment:
17 (a) Must be finalized and published on the Internet website
18 maintained by the school district not later than 90 days before the
19 beginning of an open enrollment period pursuant to this section;
20 and
21 (b) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, after the
22 capacity of a public school is published pursuant to paragraph (a),
23 must not be reduced for that open enrollment period unless a
24 significant change occurs that was unforeseeable at the time the
25 capacity was determined, including, without limitation, a
26 significant change in capacity caused by any issue with the
27 facilities of the public school. If such a change occurs, the school
28 district shall post on the Internet website maintained by the school
29 district an updated capacity calculation, with a written explanation
30 of the change, not less than 15 days before the date that
31 enrollment decisions are made pursuant to this section.

37 shall report to the school district in which it is located the number
38 of pupils by grade who plan to remain enrolled in the public
39 school in the following school year. Based on the information
40 reported to a school district pursuant to this subsection and the
41 capacity of each public school, on or before March 31 of each
42 year, the school district shall:
43 (a) Calculate the number of spots available for open
44 enrollment in each grade in each public school in the school
45 district; and
-
*AB584*
– 49 –
1 (b) Post on the Internet website maintained by the school
2 district the number of available spots in each grade in each public
3 school in the school district and take such other actions as are
4 reasonably calculated to notify parents or legal guardians of
5 pupils in the school district of that information.
6 5. Not later than April 15 of each year, the parent or legal
7 guardian of a pupil in the school district may, through a
8 centralized system managed by the school district, apply for the
9 pupil to attend a public school in the school district, other than the
10 public school for the zone of attendance in which the pupil resides,
11 by selecting three public schools in the school district for potential
12 enrollment by the pupil, ranked in order of preference. If a school
13 district receives more applications for a public school than there
14 are spots available in a grade in the public school, the school
15 district shall conduct a transparent two-tiered lottery to allocate
16 the spots in that grade in the public school. Such a lottery must
17 prioritize pupils as follows:
18 (a) Pupils zoned to attend a public school designated as a low-
19 performing school pursuant to section 7 of this act receive first
20 priority to fill the available spots at the requested schools.
21 (b) After accommodating pupils zoned to attend low-
22 performing schools, any remaining spots are made available to all
23 other pupils in the school district.
24 6. Not later than May 1 of each year, each school district
25 shall notify each parent or legal guardian of a pupil who
26 submitted an application pursuant to subsection 5 whether the
27 pupil will be offered a placement at a public school other than the
28 public school for the zone of attendance in which the pupil resides.
29 On or before May 15 of each year, the parent or legal guardian
30 may accept the placement. If the parent or legal guardian does not
31 accept the placement or does not respond within the required time
32 period, the pupil must be enrolled in the public school for the zone
33 of attendance in which the pupil resides.
34 7. All placements of pupils made pursuant to this section
35 must be made not later than July 15 of each school year.
36 8. Notwithstanding any provision of this section, a pupil with
37 a disability who has an individualized education program must be
38 able to attend a public school that is able to provide all
39 accommodations and services necessary to meet the requirements
40 outlined in the individualized education program.

9 subsection 1 by directly providing transportation services to
10 transport a pupil to and from the public school that the pupil is
11 selected to attend through the use of school buses or other
12 transportation services provided through a contract entered into
13 with the school district. If it is not feasible for a school district to
14 provide such direct transportation services, the school district shall
15 provide a transportation subsidy to the parent or legal guardian of
16 the pupil to assist with the cost of transporting the pupil to and
17 from the public school that the pupil is selected to attend, which
18 may be used to pay the cost of public transportation, carpool
19 expenses or other verified costs of transporting the pupil to and
20 from the public school that the pupil is selected to attend.
21 3. A subsidy for transportation services provided pursuant to
22 subsection 2 by a school district to the parent or legal guardian of
23 a pupil must be:
24 (a) In an amount not more than 200 percent of the
25 average per-pupil transportation cost of the school district for
26 the immediately preceding fiscal year, as determined by the
27 transportation expenditures of the school district for the
28 immediately preceding fiscal year;
29 (b) Distributed monthly or quarterly to the parent or legal
30 guardian of the pupil; and
31 (c) Based on the reported transportation expenses of the
32 parent or legal guardian of the pupil or a flat rate determined by
33 the school district.
34 4. To the extent practicable and to the extent of available
35 resources, each school district shall provide or coordinate
36 transportation options for pupils, other than pupils for whom the
37 school district is required by this section to provide transportation
38 services or a subsidy for transportation services, who are attending
39 a public school outside the zone of attendance in which the pupil
40 resides.

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Section 1 of this bill establishes a procedure by which the superintendent of
2 schools of a school district or the Superintendent of Public Instruction is authorized
3 to modify, suspend or eliminate a requirement for a public school or school district
4 to report information or data that is redundant or duplicative or does not provide
5 information or data that is used by the Department of Education, the State Board of
6 Education or any other person or entity to support educational outcomes.
7 Existing law establishes a statewide system of accountability for public schools
8 that includes, without limitation, a method to annually rate each public school
9 based on the performance of the school and on whether each public school meets
10 the school achievement targets and performance targets established pursuant to the
11 statewide system of accountability. (NRS 385A.600) Sections 3-5 and 11 of this
12 bill establish a similar system of accountability for school districts in this State.
13 Section 6 of this bill establishes criteria and procedures for the Superintendent to
14 designate a school district as low-performing or underperforming. Section 13 of
15 this bill requires: (1) the Superintendent to place a school district designated as
16 underperforming on probation if the designation is based on certain findings related
17 to the performance of the board of trustees of the school district; and (2) such a
18 school district to submit to the Department a school district performance
19 improvement plan and a school board improvement plan. Section 14 of this bill
20 authorizes the Superintendent to take certain actions if the board of trustees of a
21 school district does not make adequate progress toward meeting the goals and
22 benchmarks necessary to improve the performance of the school district, including,
23 without limitation, state oversight of the governance of the school district by the
24 board of trustees. Section 15 of this bill requires: (1) the Superintendent to place a
25 school district designated as underperforming on probation if the designation was
26 based on certain findings relating to the performance of pupils within the school
27 district; and (2) such a school district to submit to the Superintendent a school
28 district performance improvement plan. Section 15 also establishes the actions that
29 the Superintendent is authorized to take if the school district does not make
30 adequate progress toward improving the performance of pupils in the school
31 district, including, without limitation, replacing the leadership of the school district,
32 reallocating school district resources to prioritize support for low-performing
33 schools and assuming state control over certain functions of the school district.
34 Section 7 of this bill establishes criteria for designating a public school as low-
35 performing, and sections 28-37 of this bill prescribe the actions that may be taken
36 with respect to a public school designated as low-performing or persistently
37 underperforming. Under section 28: (1) the Superintendent is required to place on
-
*AB584*

– 3 –
38 probation a public school designated as low-performing; (2) the principal of the
39 public school is required to submit to the Superintendent a school improvement
40 plan; (3) the Superintendent is authorized to appoint an independent school
41 improvement official to oversee and monitor the progress of the school; and (4) the
42 Superintendent is required to designate as persistently underperforming a public
43 school placed on probation that fails to make adequate progress toward improving
44 pupil performance. Section 29 requires the Superintendent to initiate a process for
45 state intervention to implement certain corrective measures for a school that is
46 designated as persistently underperforming. Section 30 establishes provisions
47 governing the corrective measure of replacing the principal and key members of the
48 staff of a school. Section 31 establishes provisions governing the corrective
49 measure of the direct management of a school by the Department, as implemented
50 by the Superintendent. Section 32 establishes provisions governing the corrective
51 measure of transferring management of a school to the city or county in which the
52 school is located. Section 33 establishes provisions governing the corrective
53 measure of the conversion of a school into a charter school. Section 34 establishes
54 provisions governing the corrective measure of the conversion of a school to an
55 innovation school, and section 35 provides for the creation of networks of such
56 innovation schools. Section 36 provides for the transfer of ownership and
57 possession or the leasing of school facilities of a public school that is subject to
58 certain corrective measures. Section 61 of this bill: (1) creates the Education
59 Service Center; (2) provides for the appointment of a governing body for the
60 Center; and (3) requires the Center to provide certain assistance and guidance to
61 public schools and school districts that are experiencing low performance.
62 Section 37 requires a school that is designated as low-performing for 3
63 consecutive years to be designated as chronically low-performing and provides for
64 expanded achievement options for the pupils attending the school, including,
65 without limitation, attending another public school in the school district, a charter
66 school or a private school that satisfies certain requirements. Section 38 of this bill
67 requires the State Treasurer to adopt regulations to establish and carry out the
68 Nevada Integrity in Academic Funding Program. Under section 38, to the extent
69 that money is available to carry out the Program, the State Treasurer is required to
70 create a Resources for Inspiring Student Excellence Account, or “RISE Account,”
71 which may be used by the parent or legal guardian of a qualified pupil to pay
72 certain qualified educational expenses associated with participating in an expanded
73 achievement option pursuant to section 37.
74 Existing law provides that on or before December 31 of each year, the board of
75 trustees of each school district and the sponsor of each charter school is required to
76 prepare for the immediately preceding school year a report of accountability
77 concerning the educational goals and objectives of the school district or charter
78 school. (NRS 385A.070) Section 8 of this bill revises the date on which the board
79 of trustees of a school district or sponsor of a charter is required to provide written
80 notice that the report is available on the Internet website maintained by the school
81 district or sponsor of the charter school. Section 9 of this bill requires such a report
82 to include applicable comparisons to pupils in other states.
83 Existing law: (1) creates the Education Stabilization Account as a reserve
84 account within the State Education Fund; (2) authorizes the transfer of money
85 between the Account and the Fund for certain purposes; and (3) provides that the
86 balance in the Account must not exceed 20 percent of the total of all appropriations
87 and authorizations from the Fund, excluding the Account, for the immediately
88 preceding fiscal year. (NRS 387.1213) Section 17 of this bill: (1) creates the
89 Excellence in Education Account in the State Education Fund; (2) establishes the
90 maximum amount of money that may be in the Excellence in Education Account;
91 and (3) provides for the transfer of money to the Excellence in Education Account
92 under certain circumstances. Under section 17, money in the Excellence in
-
*AB584*

– 4 –
93 Education Account must be used only to make grants of money to school districts,
94 charter schools and university schools for profoundly gifted pupils to provide
95 nonrecurring incentives to school administrators, teachers and other educational
96 personnel, including, without limitation, to pay incentives to school administrators
97 and teachers pursuant to any program established pursuant to section 59 or 60 of
98 this bill. Section 18 of this bill: (1) makes conforming changes to provisions
99 of existing law governing the Education Stabilization Account to reflect the transfer
100 of certain money to the Excellence in Education Account; and (2) requires money
101 in the Education Stabilization Account to be transferred to the Department to
102 undertake certain measures to oversee or allocate resources to a school district that
103 is designated as low-performing or underperforming pursuant to section 6 or a
104 school that is designated as low-performing pursuant to section 7 or persistently
105 underperforming pursuant to section 28.
106 As part of the Pupil-Centered Funding Plan, existing law requires money in
107 each fiscal year to be appropriated to each school district to provide transportation
108 for pupils. (NRS 387.1214) Section 19 of this bill additionally authorizes a charter
109 school to receive money to provide transportation for pupils if the provision of
110 transportation for pupils is authorized in the charter contract entered into by the
111 governing body of the charter school and the sponsor of the charter school.
112 Existing law creates the Commission on School Funding and establishes the
113 duties of the Commission. (NRS 387.1246, 387.12463) Section 20 of this bill
114 requires the Commission to review the process of adjusting school funding
115 allocations based on the count of weighted pupil groups and evaluate alternatives
116 for making those adjustments. Under existing law, any recommendations resulting
117 from such a review are required to be presented to the Joint Interim Standing
118 Committee on Education, and after consideration by the Committee, the
119 Commission is required to transmit the recommendations to the Governor and the
120 Legislature. (NRS 387.12463)
121 Existing law: (1) authorizes the board of trustees of certain school districts to
122 zone the school district and determine which pupils must attend each school; and
123 (2) allows pupils to attend certain schools despite the zoning decision of the board
124 of trustees. (NRS 388.040) Section 22 of this bill provides for the implementation
125 of a system of open enrollment managed by each school district pursuant to which
126 the parent or legal guardian of a pupil may apply for the pupil to attend a school
127 outside of the zone of attendance in which the pupil resides. Section 39 of this bill
128 makes a conforming change to authorize a pupil to attend a public school outside of
129 the zone of attendance in which the pupil resides if the pupil is selected to attend a
130 different public school under the system of open enrollment. Section 23 of this bill
131 requires the school district to provide transportation services, or subsidize
132 transportation services, for a pupil who is attending or is zoned to attend a school
133 designated as low-performing pursuant to section 7 and who is selected to attend a
134 different school under the system of open enrollment. Section 16 of this bill
135 authorizes the board of trustees of a school district that furnishes transportation to
136 pupils to elect not to provide transportation to a pupil who attends a public school
137 outside of his or her zone of attendance pursuant to section 22, unless the school
138 district is required to provide transportation to such a pupil pursuant to section 23.
139 Section 24 of this bill requires the Department to monitor the system of open
140 enrollment, collect data and prepare certain reports concerning the system.
141 Existing law requires an elementary school to provide intervention services and
142 intensive instruction to a pupil during the time the pupil attends the school if the
143 pupil does not obtain a score in the subject area of reading on the criterion-
144 referenced examination in reading that meets the score prescribed by the State
145 Board. (NRS 388A.487, 392.760) Sections 25-27 of this bill provide for the
146 creation by each school district of a Parent-Selected Intervention Options Program
147 under which the parent or legal guardian of a pupil who is required to be provided
-
*AB584*

– 5 –
148 such intervention services and intensive instruction may receive a grant of money
149 from the school district to pay the expenses of literacy interventions, tutoring and
150 other related services. Section 25 establishes the Empowering Parents Account in
151 the State Education Fund and requires $1,000,000 per fiscal year, or such greater
152 amount as may be appropriated by the Legislature, to be transferred from the State
153 Education Fund to the Account for the purpose of making distributions to school
154 districts for the Program. Section 26 requires each school district to establish the
155 Program and establishes an order of priority for making grants under the Program
156 based on the adjusted gross income of the household in which the pupil resides.
157 Section 27 requires: (1) a service provider to register with the school district to be
158 eligible to provide literacy intervention, tutoring and related services to pupils
159 under the Program; and (2) such services to be evidence-based and to meet certain
160 criteria. Section 10 of this bill requires the statewide system of accountability for
161 public schools to include, for elementary schools, the proportion of pupils
162 demonstrating adequate proficiency in the subject area of reading and adequate
163 progress to achieving such proficiency.
164 Existing law: (1) authorizes certain entities, including, without limitation, a city
165 or county, to sponsor charter schools; and (2) prohibits a city or county from
166 sponsoring a new charter school or expanding the enrollment or operating an
167 additional campus of an existing charter school sponsored by the city or county if
168 the total number of pupils enrolled in the charter schools sponsored by the city or
169 county exceeds a certain percentage of the pupils enrolled in public schools in the
170 city or county other than in charter schools not sponsored by the city or county.
171 (NRS 388A.220) Section 40 of this bill creates an exception to this prohibition by
172 authorizing a city or county to sponsor a new charter school or expand the
173 enrollment or operate an additional campus of an existing charter school sponsored
174 by the city or county, regardless of the number of pupils that will be enrolled in the
175 charter schools sponsored by the city or county, if: (1) the city or county is in a
176 school district that is designated as low-performing pursuant to section 6; and (2)
177 the new charter school or increase in enrollment or additional campus of the
178 existing charter school will serve pupils who reside in the zone of attendance of a
179 public school that is designated as low-performing pursuant to section 7 or
180 persistently underperforming pursuant to section 28 or is overcrowded.
181 Existing law: (1) designates certain academic subjects, including English
182 language arts, as core academic subjects that must be taught in all public schools;
183 and (2) requires the Council to Establish Academic Standards for Public Schools to
184 adopt standards of content and performance for certain courses of study, including
185 courses in the core academic subjects. (NRS 389.018, 389.520) Section 44 of this
186 bill requires the standards for English language arts in kindergarten and grades 1, 2
187 and 3 to include phonics-based instruction and to integrate science, technology,
188 engineering and mathematics into instruction in English language arts. Section 42
189 of this bill requires the Department, to the extent that money is available for such a
190 purpose, to establish a pilot program under which schools or groups of schools may
191 apply to the Department for grants to integrate science, technology, engineering and
192 mathematics into instruction in literacy. Section 43 of this bill requires the model
193 curriculum for English language arts, which the State Board is required to develop
194 under existing law, to include phonics-based instruction and the integration of
195 science, technology, engineering and mathematics into English language arts in
196 kindergarten and grades 1, 2 and 3. Under existing law, such a model curriculum is
197 required to be distributed to public schools for use by teachers and administrators in
198 developing class lesson plans and to the governing bodies of regional training
199 programs for the professional development of teachers and administrators for use in
200 the provision of training to teachers and administrators. (NRS 389.026)
201 Section 46 of this bill provides that a school employee is immune from civil
202 and criminal liability for actions taken in good faith to intervene in physical
-
*AB584*

– 6 –
203 altercations, fights or other incidents that pose an imminent risk to the safety of
204 pupils or staff if: (1) the school employee is acting within the course and scope of
205 his or her employment and within the course and scope of his or her role in
206 maintaining order, discipline or the safety of pupils; (2) the actions of the school
207 employee are consistent with state, federal and local laws and the policies of the
208 school district or school at which the school employee is employed; and (3) any
209 harm caused by the intervention is not the result of intentional, willful, grossly
210 negligent or reckless misconduct or a conscious and flagrant indifference to the
211 rights or safety of the person harmed. Section 64 of this bill applies this immunity
212 from civil and criminal liability to employees of private schools.
213 Existing law requires the Commission on Professional Standards in Education
214 to adopt regulations prescribing the qualifications for licensing teachers and other
215 educational personnel, including regulations governing examinations for the initial
216 licensing of teachers and other educational personnel and the procedures for the
217 issuance and renewal of those licenses. (NRS 391.019, 391.021) Under existing
218 regulations, a license to teach elementary education authorizes the holder to teach
219 all subjects in elementary grades. (NAC 391.090) Sections 53-55 of this bill require
220 the Commission to adopt regulations requiring that, to be eligible to teach pupils in
221 kindergarten or grade 1, 2 or 3 on or after July 1, 2028, a teacher is required to
222 obtain an endorsement to teach such pupils by successfully completing a course of
223 instruction in foundational literacy skills that is approved by the Commission and
224 meets certain standards. Section 65 of this bill authorizes the Board of Regents of
225 the University of Nevada to require certain institutions within the System to
226 collaborate with the Department and the Commission to establish such courses of
227 instruction at the institutions.
228 Existing law requires a postprobationary employee of a school district whose
229 performance is designated as developing or ineffective for 2 consecutive years to
230 serve an additional probationary period. (NRS 391.730) Under existing law: (1) a
231 period of probation is for three 1-year periods and a probationary employee has no
232 right to employment after any of the three probationary contract years; and (2)
233 during the contract year, the probationary employee may be dismissed after
234 receiving notice and an opportunity for a hearing. (NRS 391.820-391.826) Section
235 56 of this bill provides that if a postprobationary employee is serving an additional
236 probationary period under existing law and the postprobationary employee receives
237 a rating of ineffective for 2 consecutive years during that additional probationary
238 period: (1) the board of trustees of the school district may notify the employee that
239 the employee will not be reemployed for the next contract year; or (2) the
240 superintendent of the school district may initiate the process of dismissing the
241 employee during a contract year. Under section 56, if a school district does not
242 reemploy or dismisses such an employee, the Department is required to provide: (1)
243 the school district with certain assistance in recruiting and hiring a highly effective
244 administrator to fill any vacancy created; and (2) school leadership with access to
245 certain coaching to assist the school leadership in managing transitions and
246 improving teaching practices.
247 Section 52 of this bill authorizes a postprobationary teacher to be placed on a
248 period of probation of 2 school years if the evaluations of the postprobationary
249 teacher have consistently rated the postprobationary teacher as ineffective in certain
250 areas. If a postprobationary teacher is placed on such a period of probation, a
251 performance improvement plan must be established for the postprobationary
252 teacher pursuant to section 51 of this bill. Under section 52, at the conclusion of
253 the period of probation pursuant to that section, the postprobationary teacher must
254 be evaluated. If, based on that evaluation, the teacher has not made adequate
255 progress toward meeting improvement goals, section 52 authorizes the teacher to
256 not be reemployed or to be dismissed in the same manner as a probationary
257 employee.

258 Sections 47 and 48 of this bill enact provisions for administrators similar to
259 sections 51 and 52. Section 49 of this bill provides that if the principal of a public
260 school in a large school district, as defined in existing law, (currently only Clark
261 County School District) receives a rating of ineffective or minimally effective, or is
262 placed on probation pursuant to section 48, the Superintendent of Public Instruction
263 is authorized to suspend or modify certain site-based decision-making authority of
264 the school organizational team. (NRS 388G.500-388G.810) Section 50 of this bill
265 requires the Department to track certain data relating to the effectiveness of
266 programs that provide training for school administrators, assess the effectiveness of
267 such programs and make recommendations for the improvement of such programs.
268 Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district and the
269 governing body of each charter school to ensure that teachers employed by the
270 school district or charter school have access to certain professional development
271 training. (NRS 391A.370) Under existing law, a program of professional
272 development training provided by regional training programs is required to include,
273 without limitation, training in methods to teach fundamental reading skills for
274 teachers who teach kindergarten and grades 1, 2 and 3. (NRS 391A.125) Section 58
275 of this bill requires the board of trustees of each school district and the governing
276 body of each charter school to ensure that teachers who teach pupils in kindergarten
277 and grades 1, 2 and 3, administrators of schools in which such pupils are enrolled,
278 certain other administrators and paraprofessionals who directly serve such pupils
279 complete a course of professional development training in the science of reading
280 that is approved by the Department.
281 Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district to establish a
282 program of performance pay and enhanced compensation for the recruitment and
283 retention of licensed teachers and administrators. The program is required to have
284 as its primary focus improvement in the academic achievement of pupils and
285 implementation in at-risk schools and schools receiving the lowest rating possible
286 indicating underperformance of a public school. (NRS 391A.450) Under the
287 program: (1) the board of trustees of each school district is required to reserve, for
288 each fiscal year, an amount of money sufficient to provide an increase in base
289 salaries, not including monetary benefits, for at least 5 percent of the teachers and
290 administrators employed by the school district; and (2) the amount of the increase
291 must not exceed 10 percent of the annual base salary of each teacher and
292 administrator to whom the increase is paid. (NRS 391A.455) Section 59 provides
293 that if, at any time, the proportion of administrators in a school district, charter
294 school or network of charter schools whose performance evaluation is highly
295 effective is 85 percent or less for 2 consecutive school years, the board of trustees
296 of a school district or the sponsor of a charter school is authorized to establish a
297 program to pay one-time incentives in an amount not to exceed 10 percent of the
298 annual base salary of administrators who achieve a performance rating of highly
299 effective for 5 consecutive years. Section 60 authorizes the board of trustees of a
300 school district or the sponsor of a charter school to establish a similar program for
301 teachers who achieve a performance rating of highly effective for 3 consecutive
302 years.
303 Sections 66-68 of this bill make appropriations to carry out the provisions of
304 this bill.

1 Section 1. Chapter 385 of NRS is hereby amended by adding
2 thereto a new section to read as follows:
3 1. It is the intent of the Legislature to:
4 (a) Enhance the efficiency of education reporting
5 requirements by eliminating the reporting of redundant
6 information and data, reducing administrative burdens and
7 ensuring that all reports serve a meaningful purpose in supporting
8 educational outcomes.
9 (b) Ensure that teachers and school administrators, who are
10 directly impacted by reporting requirements, have agency in
11 recommending modifications to reporting requirements.
12 (c) Preserve transparency, the accountability of public schools
13 and school districts for the quality of schools and the educational
14 achievement of pupils, and the accessibility of information and
15 data concerning the educational achievement of pupils.
16 2. A teacher or school administrator employed at a public
17 school, a charter management organization that operates a
18 charter school or an educational management organization that
19 provides support or operations to a charter school may submit a
20 petition to modify, suspend or eliminate a requirement for a public
21 school or school district to report information or data to another
22 person or entity. Such a petition must be submitted to the
23 superintendent of schools of the school district in which the public
24 school is located or, if the public school is a charter school, the
25 governing body of the charter school. The petition must:
26 (a) Clearly identify the requirement to report information or
27 data that the petitioner is seeking to modify, suspend or eliminate;
28 (b) Contain a detailed explanation of the reason that the

30 redundant or does not provide information or data that is used by
31 the Department, the State Board or any other person or entity to
32 support educational outcomes; and
33 (c) Propose an alternative report of information or data, if any,
34 that would ensure that information and data to support
35 educational outcomes remains accessible.
36 3. Upon receipt of a petition submitted pursuant to subsection
37 2, the superintendent of schools of the school district or governing
38 body of the charter school, as applicable, shall:
39 (a) Review the petition to determine whether the requirement
40 to report data or information that is proposed for modification,

17 district denies a petition to modify, suspend or eliminate a
18 requirement for a public school to report data or information to
19 the school district, the superintendent shall provide a written
20 explanation of the reasons for the denial to the petitioner. A
21 petitioner whose petition is denied pursuant to this paragraph may
22 submit a request for reconsideration of the denial to the
23 superintendent of schools of the school district or resubmit the
24 petition with additional information.
25 (c) If the petition requests to modify, suspend or eliminate a
26 requirement for a public school or the school district to report data
27 or information to any person or entity other than the school
28 district and the superintendent of schools of the school district
29 finds that the requirement to report data or information proposed
30 for modification, suspension or elimination is duplicative or
31 redundant or does not provide data that is used by the school
32 district to support educational outcomes, approve the petition and
33 forward the petition to the Department for consideration pursuant

10 learning; and
11 (e) The potential impact of the modification, suspension or
12 elimination of the reporting requirement on transparency, the
13 accountability of public schools and schools districts for the
14 quality of schools and the educational achievement of pupils, and

30 the Department, the State Board or any other person or entity to
31 support educational outcomes, the Superintendent may issue an
32 order modifying, suspending or eliminating the requirement. If the

13 (d) Any other requirements necessary to implement the
14 provisions of this section.
15 Sec. 2. Chapter 385A of NRS is hereby amended by adding
16 thereto the provisions set forth as sections 3 to 7, inclusive, of this
17 act.
18 Sec. 3. 1. The Department shall make every effort to ensure
19 that the statewide system of accountability for public schools
20 applies uniformly to all school districts in this State and complies
21 with all requirements for the accountability of public schools,
22 including, without limitation, requirements for the receipt of
23 federal money under the Elementary and Secondary Education
24 Act of 1965, 20 U.S.C. §§ 6301 et seq., as amended.
25 2. The statewide system of accountability for public schools
26 applies to all school districts in this State, regardless of size or
27 demographics, and must, except as otherwise provided in
28 subsection 3 of section 5 of this act:
29 (a) Include a method to, on an annual basis, rate each school
30 district based upon the collective performance of the public
31 schools within the school district and the achievement of district-
32 wide performance targets established pursuant to the statewide
33 system of accountability for public schools;
34 (b) Include a method to implement consequences, rewards and
35 supports for school districts based upon such ratings, with a focus
36 on addressing disparities and improving outcomes for historically
37 underserved populations;
38 (c) Include a method to provide grants, financial support or
39 other resources, to the extent that money is available for that
40 purpose, to school districts receiving one of the two lowest ratings
41 of performance pursuant to the statewide system of accountability
42 for public schools; and
43 (d) Establish district-wide achievement targets and
44 performance targets for specific groups of pupils, including,
45 without limitation, pupils who are economically disadvantaged,
-
*AB584*

– 13 –
1 pupils from major racial and ethnic groups, pupils with disabilities
2 and pupils who are English learners. The district-wide
3 achievement targets and performance targets must be based on
4 aggregated metrics from the public schools within the school
5 district, including, without limitation, measurements of the
6 progress and proficiency of pupils on the examinations
7 administered pursuant to NRS 390.105.
8 3. The statewide system of accountability for public schools
9 must:
10 (a) Ensure that data collected under the system is used to
11 promote transparency, equity and measureable progress in pupil
12 achievement in school districts throughout this State;
13 (b) Provide for the monitoring and oversight of the operations
14 of, and allocation of resources by, school districts for the purpose
15 of improving pupil outcomes; and
16 (c) Establish mechanisms for public reporting on the
17 performance of each school district, including, without limitation,
18 accountability metrics and a detailed analysis of the progress of
19 each school district toward its district-wide achievement targets.
20 4. In developing the statewide system of accountability for
21 public schools required by this section, including, without
22 limitation, the achievement and performance targets for school
23 districts and the criteria used to rate each school district, the
24 Department shall meaningfully consult with the parents and
25 guardians of pupils enrolled in public schools in this State.
26 5. The Department shall provide technical assistance and
27 guidance to school districts to support compliance with the
28 statewide system of accountability for public schools and to
29 address deficiencies identified through the rating process.
30 Sec. 4. 1. On or before a date determined by the
31 Superintendent of Public Instruction, but not later than the third
32 Friday in August of each year, the Department shall determine
33 whether each school district is meeting the district-wide
34 achievement targets and performance targets established pursuant
35 to the statewide system of accountability for public schools.
36 2. The determination for a school district must be made
37 pursuant to subsection 1 in consultation with the board of trustees
38 of the school district and must be based only upon the information
39 and data for those pupils who are enrolled in the public schools
40 within the school district for a full academic year. On or before a
41 date determined by the Superintendent of Public Instruction, but
42 not later than the third Friday in August of each year, the
43 Department shall:
44 (a) Transmit the determination made for each school district to
45 the board of trustees of that school district;
-
*AB584*

– 14 –
1 (b) Transmit the determination made for each school district to
2 the State Board and the Governor; and
3 (c) Post on the Internet website maintained by the Department
4 a report summarizing the determination made for each school
5 district, including, without limitation, the metrics for measuring
6 the achievement and performance for each school district.
7 3. If the number of pupils in a particular group who are
8 enrolled in a public school in a school district is insufficient to
9 yield statistically reliable information:
10 (a) The Department shall not determine that the school district
11 has failed to meet the performance targets established pursuant to
12 the statewide system of accountability for public schools based
13 solely upon that particular group.
14 (b) The pupils in such a group must be included in the overall
15 count of pupils enrolled in the public schools in the school district
16 and who took the examinations administered pursuant to
17 NRS 390.105.
18  The Department shall use the mechanism approved by the
19 United States Department of Education for the statewide system of
20 accountability for public schools for determining the number of
21 pupils that must be in a group for that group to yield statistically
22 reliable information.
23 4. If an irregularity in testing administration or an
24 irregularity in testing security occurs at one or more public
25 schools in the school district and the irregularity invalidates the
26 test scores of pupils, such test scores must be included in the
27 aggregate of scores reported for the school district, the attendance
28 of those pupils must be counted toward the total number of pupils
29 who took the examinations administered pursuant to NRS 390.105
30 and the pupils must be included in the total number of pupils who
31 were required to take the examinations. The determination made
32 pursuant to subsection 1 for a school district must reflect any such
33 irregularity and describe the impact of any such irregularity on
34 the determination.
35 5. As used in this section:
36 (a) “Irregularity in testing administration” has the meaning
37 ascribed to it in NRS 390.255.
38 (b) “Irregularity in testing security” has the meaning ascribed
39 to it in NRS 390.260.
40 Sec. 5. 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3,
41 based upon the determinations made by the Department pursuant
42 to section 4 of this act, the Department shall, on or before a date
43 determined by the Superintendent of Public Instruction but not
44 later than the third Friday in August of each year, issue a
-
*AB584*

– 15 –
1 preliminary rating for each school district in accordance with the
2 statewide system of accountability for public schools.
3 2. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3:
4 (a) Before making a final rating for a school district, the
5 Department shall provide the school district an opportunity to
6 review the data upon which the preliminary rating is based and to
7 present evidence or corrections. The Department shall notify the
8 board of trustees of the school district of the opportunities
9 provided pursuant to this paragraph and provide a reasonable
10 period within which to present evidence or corrections pursuant to
11 this paragraph.
12 (b) After considering any evidence or corrections submitted by
13 a school district within the reasonable period prescribed by the
14 Department pursuant to paragraph (a), the Department shall, on
15 or before a date determined by the Superintendent of Public
16 Instruction but not later than the third Friday in September of
17 each year, make a final determination concerning the rating for
18 the school district.
19 3. The Department may temporarily waive or otherwise pause
20 the requirement to make ratings for school districts that comply
21 with 20 U.S.C. § 6311(c) pursuant to this section if the United
22 States Department of Education grants a waiver from or otherwise
23 pauses the requirements of 20 U.S.C. § 6311(c).

3 4. If the Interim Finance Committee finds that:
4 (a) Upon submission of a request from the Department, the
5 actual enrollment growth for a fiscal year exceeds the projected
6 enrollment growth by an amount that the Interim Finance
7 Committee determines would make a transfer of money to the State
8 Education Fund necessary to fund the excess enrollment;
9 (b) The collection of revenue in any fiscal year will result in the
10 State Education Fund receiving less money than authorized for
11 expenditure from the State Education Fund;
12 (c) Upon submission of a request from the Department, any
13 amount of money which was deposited in the State Education Fund
14 is found by an audit to have been deposited in error; [or]
15 (d) Upon submission of a request from the Department, any
16 error in the application of the Pupil-Centered Funding Plan by the
17 Department has created a shortfall in the State Education Fund [,] ;
18 or
19 (e) Upon submission of a request from the Department, the
20 Department is required to undertake extraordinary measures to
21 oversee or allocate resources to a school district that is designated
22 as a low-performing school district or underperforming school
23 district pursuant to section 6 of this act or a public school that is
24 designated as a low-performing school pursuant to section 7 of
25 this act or as persistently underperforming pursuant to subsection
26 6 of section 28 of this act,
27  the Committee shall by resolution establish an amount of money
28 to transfer from the Education Stabilization Account to the State
29 Education Fund and direct the State Controller to transfer that
30 amount to the State Education Fund. The State Controller shall
31 thereupon make the transfer.
32 5. When determining the actual ending fund balance for the
33 purposes of subsection 1, each county school district shall exclude:
34 (a) Any money deposited in the county school district fund on or
35 before June 30, 2020;
36 (b) Any money apportioned to the county school district for

*AB584*

– 40 –
1 pupils pursuant to NRS 387.185 exceeds the amount of money
2 available in the State Education Fund because of a delay in expected
3 receipts, he or she may request from the Director of the Office of
4 Finance a temporary advance from the Education Stabilization
5 Account for the payment of such money due. Upon receipt of such a
6 request, the Director of the Office of Finance shall make a
7 recommendation to the Interim Finance Committee to approve the
8 temporary advance in whole or in part or to deny the request. If the
9 Interim Finance Committee approves the request in whole or in part,
10 the Director of the Office of Finance shall notify the State Controller
11 and the Fiscal Analysis Division of the Legislative Counsel Bureau
12 of the amount approved by the Interim Finance Committee, and the
13 State Controller shall draw his or her warrant upon receipt of such a
14 notice of approval. Any money which is temporarily advanced from
15 the Education Stabilization Account pursuant to this subsection
16 must be repaid by August 31 following the end of the fiscal year in
17 which the temporary advance is made.

19 act, the balance remaining in the State Education Fund, excluding
20 the balance remaining in the Education Stabilization Account, that
21 has not been committed for expenditure on or before June 30 of an
22 odd-numbered fiscal year must be transferred to the Education
23 Stabilization Account to the extent that such a transfer would not
24 cause the balance in the Education Stabilization Account to exceed
25 the limit established in subsection 3.
26 Sec. 19. NRS 387.1214 is hereby amended to read as follows:
27 387.1214 1. After a direct legislative appropriation is made to
28 the State Education Fund from the State General Fund pursuant to
29 NRS 387.1212, the Legislature shall determine the statewide base
30 per pupil funding amount for each fiscal year of the biennium,
31 which is the amount of money expressed on a per pupil basis for the
32 projected enrollment of the public schools in this State, determined
33 to be sufficient by the Legislature to fund the costs of all public
34 schools in this State to operate and provide general education to all
35 pupils for any purpose for which specific funding is not
36 appropriated pursuant to paragraph (a), (b) , (c) or [(e)] (f) of
37 subsection 2 or NRS 387.122. It is the intent of the Legislature that
38 the statewide base per pupil funding amount for any fiscal year, to
39 the extent practicable, be not less than the statewide base per pupil
40 funding amount for the immediately preceding fiscal year, adjusted
41 by the rate of inflation, unless the amount of money contained in the
42 State Education Fund, excluding the Education Stabilization
43 Account, decreases from the preceding fiscal year. If the amount of
44 money contained in the State Education Fund, excluding the
45 Education Stabilization Account, decreases from the preceding
-
*AB584*

– 41 –
1 fiscal year, it is the intent of the Legislature that a proportional
2 reduction be made in both the statewide base per pupil funding
3 amount and the weighted funding appropriated pursuant to
4 paragraph [(e)] (f) of subsection 2.
5 2. After a direct legislative appropriation is made to the State
6 Education Fund from the State General Fund pursuant to NRS
7 387.1212, the money in the State Education Fund, excluding any
8 amount of money in the Education Stabilization Account, must be
9 appropriated as established by law for each fiscal year of the
10 biennium for the following purposes:
11 (a) To each school district, an amount of money determined to
12 be sufficient by the Legislature, when combined with any other
13 resources available for this purpose, to provide food services [and
14 transportation] for pupils and any other similar service that the
15 Legislature deems appropriate.
16 (b) To each school district and charter school authorized
17 under its charter contract, as defined in NRS 388A.015, to offer
18 transportation for pupils, an amount of money determined to be
19 sufficient by the Legislature, when combined with any other
20 resources available for this purpose, to provide transportation for
21 pupils.
22 (c) To each school district, charter school or university school
23 for profoundly gifted pupils, an amount of money determined to be
24 sufficient by the Legislature, when combined with any other
25 resources available for this purpose, to provide local funding to
26 support pupils with disabilities.
27 [(c)] (d) To each school district, an amount of money
28 determined to be sufficient by the Legislature, when combined with
29 any other resources available for this purpose, to provide adjusted
30 base per pupil funding for each pupil estimated to be enrolled in the
31 school district.
32 [(d)] (e) To each charter school or university school for
33 profoundly gifted pupils, an amount of money determined to be
34 sufficient by the Legislature, when combined with any other
35 resources available for this purpose, to provide:
36 (1) The statewide base per pupil funding amount for each
37 pupil estimated to be enrolled full-time in a program of distance
38 education provided by the charter school or university school for
39 profoundly gifted pupils; and
40 (2) Adjusted base per pupil funding for each pupil estimated
41 to be enrolled in the charter school or university school for
42 profoundly gifted pupils other than a pupil identified in
43 subparagraph (1).
44 [(e)] (f) To each school district, charter school or university
45 school for profoundly gifted pupils, an amount of money determined
-
*AB584*

– 42 –
1 to be sufficient by the Legislature, when combined with any other
2 resources available for this purpose, to provide additional weighted
3 funding for each pupil estimated to be enrolled in the school district,
4 charter school or university school for profoundly gifted pupils who
5 is:
6 (1) An English learner;
7 (2) An at-risk pupil; or
8 (3) A gifted and talented pupil.
9 3. The adjusted base per pupil funding appropriated pursuant to
10 paragraph [(c)] (d) of subsection 2 for each school district must be
11 determined by applying the cost adjustment factor established
12 pursuant to NRS 387.1215 which applies to the school district and
13 the attendance area adjustment established pursuant to NRS
14 387.1218 which applies to each applicable area of the school district
15 to the statewide base per pupil funding amount.
16 4. The adjusted base per pupil funding appropriated pursuant to
17 subparagraph (2) of paragraph [(d)] (e) of subsection 2 for each
18 charter school or university school for profoundly gifted pupils must
19 be determined by applying the cost adjustment factor established
20 pursuant to NRS 387.1215 which applies to the charter school or
21 university school and, if applicable, the attendance area adjustment
22 established pursuant to NRS 387.1218 to the statewide base per
23 pupil funding amount.
24 5. The weighted funding appropriated pursuant to paragraph
25 [(e)] (f) of subsection 2 must be established separately for each
26 category of pupils identified in that paragraph and expressed as a
27 multiplier to be applied to the statewide base per pupil funding
28 amount determined pursuant to subsection 1. A pupil who belongs
29 to more than one category of pupils or for whom a school district,
30 charter school or university school for profoundly gifted pupils is
31 eligible to receive the statewide multiplier pursuant to NRS 387.122
32 must receive only the weighted funding for the single category to
33 which the pupil belongs which has the largest multiplier or the
34 statewide multiplier, whichever is larger. It is the intent of the
35 Legislature that, to the extent practicable:
36 (a) The multiplier for each category of pupils for any fiscal year
37 be not less than the multiplier for the immediately preceding fiscal
38 year unless:
39 (1) The amount of money contained in the State Education
40 Fund, excluding the Education Stabilization Account, decreases
41 from the preceding fiscal year, in which event it is the intent of the
42 Legislature that a proportional reduction be made in both the
43 statewide base per pupil funding amount and the weighted funding
44 appropriated pursuant to paragraph [(e)] (f) of subsection 2; or
-
*AB584*

– 43 –
1 (2) The amount of money contained in the State Education
2 Fund, excluding the Education Stabilization Account, increases
3 from the preceding fiscal year but in an amount which, after funding
4 the appropriations required by paragraphs (a) to [(d),] (e), inclusive,
5 of subsection 2, is insufficient to fund the multiplier for each
6 category of pupils, in which event it is the intent of the Legislature
7 that the remaining money in the State Education Fund be used to
8 provide a multiplier for each category of pupils which is as close as
9 practicable to the multiplier for the preceding fiscal year;
10 (b) The recommendations of the Commission for the multiplier
11 for each category of pupils be considered and the multiplier for one
12 category of pupils may be changed by an amount that is not
13 proportional to the change in the multiplier for one or more other
14 categories of pupils if the Legislature determines that a
15 disproportionate need to serve the pupils in the affected category
16 exists; and
17 (c) If the multipliers for all categories of pupils in a fiscal year
18 are increased from the multipliers in the immediately preceding
19 fiscal year, a proportional increase is considered for the statewide
20 base per pupil funding amount.
21 6. For any money identified in subsection 4 of NRS 362.170
22 which is deposited to the credit of the State Education Fund:
23 (a) The amount of such money for the county from which the
24 money was collected that does not exceed the total amount of
25 money appropriated pursuant to subsection 2 to the county school
26 district is deemed to be the first money appropriated pursuant to
27 subsection 2 for that county school district and the first money spent
28 by that county school district from the county school district fund
29 during the applicable fiscal year.
30 (b) The amount of such money for the county from which the
31 money was collected which exceeds the total amount of money
32 appropriated pursuant to subsection 2 to the county school district
33 must be transferred to the county school district and is hereby
34 authorized for expenditure as a continuing appropriation for the
35 purpose of mitigating the adverse effects of the cyclical nature of
36 the industry of extracting and processing minerals on the ability of
37 the county school district to offer its pupils a reasonably equal
38 educational opportunity.
39 7. The weighted funding appropriated pursuant to paragraph
40 [(e)] (f) of subsection 2:
41 (a) May not be used to settle or arbitrate disputes between a
42 recognized organization representing employees of a school district
43 or the governing body of a charter school and the school district or
44 governing body or to settle any negotiations; and
-
*AB584*

– 44 –
1 (b) May not be used to adjust the district-wide schedules of
2 salaries and benefits of the employees of a school district.
3 8. As used in this section, “rate of inflation” has the meaning
4 ascribed to it in NRS 387.12455.
5 Sec. 20. NRS 387.12463 is hereby amended to read as

21 and recommend any revisions the Commission determines to be
22 appropriate to create an optimal level of funding for the public
23 schools in this State, including, without limitation, by
24 recommending the creation or elimination of one or more categories
25 of pupils to receive additional weighted funding. If the Commission
26 makes a recommendation pursuant to this paragraph which would
27 require more money to implement than was appropriated from the
28 State Education Fund in the immediately preceding biennium,
29 the Commission shall also identify a method to fully fund the
30 recommendation within 10 years after the date of the
31 recommendation.
32 (d) Review the laws and regulations of this State relating to
33 education, make recommendations to the Joint Interim Standing
34 Committee on Education for any revision of such laws and

39 act.
40 Sec. 22. 1. Each school district shall implement a system of
41 open enrollment for school districts in this State pursuant to which
42 a pupil in a school district may attend any public school in that
43 school district, regardless of the zone of attendance in which the
44 pupil resides. The Department shall oversee the transition to a
45 system of open enrollment for school districts in this State by
-
*AB584*

– 48 –
1 providing school districts with guidance, support and resources to
2 ensure pupils and their parents or legal guardians are informed of
3 the option to participate in the system of open enrollment. The
4 provision of guidance, support and resources pursuant to this
5 subsection may include, without limitation, the creation of a
6 centralized system for the selection of public schools to facilitate
7 the application, ranking and enrollment process for pupils
8 throughout the State.
9 2. Each school district shall adopt a uniform methodology for
10 calculating the capacity of each public school within the school
11 district for the purposes of open enrollment. The methodology
12 must be documented, applied consistently across all public schools
13 within the school district and made available on the Internet
14 website maintained by the school district. The calculation of the
15 capacity of each public school within the school district for the
16 purposes of open enrollment:
17 (a) Must be finalized and published on the Internet website
18 maintained by the school district not later than 90 days before the
19 beginning of an open enrollment period pursuant to this section;
20 and
21 (b) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, after the
22 capacity of a public school is published pursuant to paragraph (a),
23 must not be reduced for that open enrollment period unless a
24 significant change occurs that was unforeseeable at the time the
25 capacity was determined, including, without limitation, a
26 significant change in capacity caused by any issue with the
27 facilities of the public school. If such a change occurs, the school
28 district shall post on the Internet website maintained by the school
29 district an updated capacity calculation, with a written explanation
30 of the change, not less than 15 days before the date that
31 enrollment decisions are made pursuant to this section.
32 3. Not later than October 15 of each year, the Department
33 shall issue guidelines for school districts to use to establish a
34 process for open enrollment for the following school year, which
35 is to be managed by each school district.
36 4. On or before January 15 of each year, each public school
37 shall report to the school district in which it is located the number
38 of pupils by grade who plan to remain enrolled in the public
39 school in the following school year. Based on the information
40 reported to a school district pursuant to this subsection and the
41 capacity of each public school, on or before March 31 of each
42 year, the school district shall:
43 (a) Calculate the number of spots available for open
44 enrollment in each grade in each public school in the school
45 district; and
-
*AB584*

– 49 –
1 (b) Post on the Internet website maintained by the school
2 district the number of available spots in each grade in each public
3 school in the school district and take such other actions as are
4 reasonably calculated to notify parents or legal guardians of
5 pupils in the school district of that information.
6 5. Not later than April 15 of each year, the parent or legal
7 guardian of a pupil in the school district may, through a
8 centralized system managed by the school district, apply for the
9 pupil to attend a public school in the school district, other than the
10 public school for the zone of attendance in which the pupil resides,
11 by selecting three public schools in the school district for potential
12 enrollment by the pupil, ranked in order of preference. If a school
13 district receives more applications for a public school than there
14 are spots available in a grade in the public school, the school
15 district shall conduct a transparent two-tiered lottery to allocate
16 the spots in that grade in the public school. Such a lottery must
17 prioritize pupils as follows:
18 (a) Pupils zoned to attend a public school designated as a low-
19 performing school pursuant to section 7 of this act receive first
20 priority to fill the available spots at the requested schools.
21 (b) After accommodating pupils zoned to attend low-
22 performing schools, any remaining spots are made available to all
23 other pupils in the school district.
24 6. Not later than May 1 of each year, each school district
25 shall notify each parent or legal guardian of a pupil who
26 submitted an application pursuant to subsection 5 whether the
27 pupil will be offered a placement at a public school other than the
28 public school for the zone of attendance in which the pupil resides.
29 On or before May 15 of each year, the parent or legal guardian
30 may accept the placement. If the parent or legal guardian does not
31 accept the placement or does not respond within the required time
32 period, the pupil must be enrolled in the public school for the zone
33 of attendance in which the pupil resides.
34 7. All placements of pupils made pursuant to this section
35 must be made not later than July 15 of each school year.
36 8. Notwithstanding any provision of this section, a pupil with
37 a disability who has an individualized education program must be
38 able to attend a public school that is able to provide all
39 accommodations and services necessary to meet the requirements
40 outlined in the individualized education program.
41 Sec. 23. 1. In accordance with this section, each school
42 district shall provide transportation services, or subsidize
43 transportation services, for pupils who:
-
*AB584*

– 50 –
1 (a) Are currently attending or zoned to attend a public school
2 designated as a low-performing school pursuant to section 7 of
3 this act; and
4 (b) Apply and are selected to attend a public school in the same
5 school district that has received one of the three highest ratings of
6 performance pursuant to the statewide system of accountability for
7 public schools.
8 2. To the extent feasible, a school district shall comply with
9 subsection 1 by directly providing transportation services to
10 transport a pupil to and from the public school that the pupil is
