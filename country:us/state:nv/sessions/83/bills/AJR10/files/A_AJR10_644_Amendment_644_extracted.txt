ASSEMBLY JOINT RESOLUTION—Urging the Federal Government to release
federally managed land in Nevada for housing.
1 WHEREAS, The State of Nevada is experiencing a significant housing crisis
2 characterized by a shortage of affordable housing and an insufficient amount of
3 land for residential development; and
4 WHEREAS, Approximately 85 percent of land in Nevada is owned and managed
5 by the Federal Government with the United States Bureau of Land Management
6 overseeing the majority of such land; and
7 WHEREAS, The limited availability of developable land is a key factor in the
8 future of affordable housing in Nevada in order to meet the needs of the growing
9 population of the State; and
10 WHEREAS, The State of Nevada has a history of bipartisan efforts that sought to
11 make certain lands available for housing while protecting other public lands for
12 future generations; and
13 WHEREAS, Releasing certain federally managed lands to the State or local
14 governments would allow for a flexible and targeted approach to address the State’s
15 long-term housing needs, economic development and community planning
16 initiatives; and
17 WHEREAS, The State of Nevada is committed to managing land in a responsible
18 and sustainable manner to balance economic development, environmental
19 stewardship and public access; and
20 WHEREAS, Transferring ownership of certain federal lands to the State or local
21 governments for the purpose of addressing the housing crisis would align with the
22 goals of the Federal Government to support local economic development and foster
23 community resilience; and
24 WHEREAS, Collaboration between federal, state and local governments is
25 essential to ensuring that land use decisions are made in the best interest of the
26 residents of Nevada while respecting environmental and cultural considerations;
27 now, therefore, be it
28 RESOLVED BY THE ASSEMBLY AND SENATE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, JOINTLY,
29 That the members of the 83rd Session of the Nevada Legislature hereby urge the
Senate Amendment No. 644 to Assembly Joint Resolution No. 10 Page 4
1 President of the United States and the Congress of the United States to prioritize the
2 passage and implementation of the Southern Nevada Economic Development and
3 Conservation Act , which releases certain parcels of federally managed land to the
4 State of Nevada and the local governments of the State for the purposes of
5 addressing and stabilizing the State’s housing crisis, while protecting public lands,
6 conservation and wildlife; and be it further
7 RESOLVED, That such transfers of land should be conducted not through
8 partisan amendments that threaten the interests of the State of Nevada, but
9 rather in a bipartisan and collaborative manner that ensures comprehensive
10 planning and public input, does not diminish potential revenue to the State,
11 promotes sustainable development and protects the environmental values,
12 including, without limitation, access to water and conservation efforts, and
13 cultural values of the affected areas; and be it further
14 RESOLVED, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly prepare and transmit a copy
15 of this resolution to the President of the United States, the Vice President of the
16 United States as the presiding officer of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the
17 United States House of Representatives and each member of the Nevada
18 Congressional Delegation; and be it further
19 RESOLVED, That this resolution becomes effective upon passage.
