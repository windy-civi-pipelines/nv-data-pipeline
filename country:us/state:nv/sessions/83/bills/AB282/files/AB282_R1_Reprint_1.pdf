4 a patient with an itemized bill at no additional cost to the patient. (NRS 629.071)
5 Sections 2 and 3 of this bill, respectively, require a medical facility or provider of
6 health care that receives notice from a patient that a medical bill contains one or
7 more specific billing errors to: (1) respond to the patient concerning the billing
8 errors, including by providing the contact information for the Office for Consumer
9 Health Assistance in the Department of Health and Human Services if the facility
10 or provider does not intend to refund the disputed charge; or (2) notify the patient
11 that the disputed charge is being reviewed. Sections 2 and 3 require the medical
12 facility or provider of health care to refund any overpayment by the patient. Section
13 2 requires the State Board of Health to establish by regulation an administrative
14 fine to impose on a medical facility that violates section 2. Section 3 authorizes the
15 imposition of disciplinary action against a provider of health care who fails to
16 comply with the requirements of section 3. Section 2.5 of this bill requires the
