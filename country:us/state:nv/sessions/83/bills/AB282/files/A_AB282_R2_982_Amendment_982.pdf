EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; requiring a medical facility or an entity that bills
for care provided by a provider of health care that receives notice from
a patient of an overcharge in a medical bill to review the potential
overcharge and refund any overpayment; authorizing the imposition of
certain administrative fines for the failure to issue such a refund within
a certain period; [providing for the payment of interest on such unpaid
refunds from the proceeds of such administrative fines;] requiring the
Governor’s Consumer Health Advocate to provide certain assistance
concerning overcharges and overpayments for health care; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides every patient of a medical facility with the right to examine the bill
2 for his or her care and receive an explanation of the bill. (NRS 449A.106) Existing law also
3 requires each provider of health care to timely provide a patient with an itemized bill at no
4 additional cost to the patient. (NRS 629.071) Sections 2 and 3 of this bill, respectively,
5 require a medical facility or an entity that bills for care provided by a provider of health care
6 that receives notice from a patient that a medical bill contains one or more overcharges to: (1)
7 respond to the patient concerning the overcharges, including by providing the contact
8 information for the Office for Consumer Health Assistance in the Department of Health and
9 Human Services if the facility or provider does not intend to refund the disputed charge; or (2)
10 notify the patient that more time is needed to investigate the disputed charge. Sections 2 and
11 3 require the medical facility or billing entity to refund any overpayment by the patient.
12 Sections 2 and 3 provide for the imposition of administrative fines against a medical facility
13 or billing entity that fails to issue such a refund. [Sections 2 and 3 require the payment of
14 interest on an overdue refund to a patient from the proceeds of those fines, and sections 5-18
15 of this bill make conforming changes to allow the use of those proceeds for that purpose.]
16 Section 2.5 of this bill requires the Governor’s Consumer Health Advocate, who serves as the
17 head of the Office, to review medical bills that consumers believe to be erroneous and assist
18 consumers in addressing overcharges and overpayments for health care.
