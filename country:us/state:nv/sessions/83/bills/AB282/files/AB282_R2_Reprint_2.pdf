AN ACT relating to health care; requiring a medical facility or an
entity that bills for care provided by a provider of health
care that receives notice from a patient of an overcharge
in a medical bill to review the potential overcharge and
refund any overpayment; authorizing the imposition of
certain administrative fines for the failure to issue such a
refund within a certain period; providing for the payment
of interest on such unpaid refunds from the proceeds of
such administrative fines; requiring the Governor’s
Consumer Health Advocate to provide certain assistance
concerning overcharges and overpayments for health care;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides every patient of a medical facility with the right to
2 examine the bill for his or her care and receive an explanation of the bill. (NRS
3 449A.106) Existing law also requires each provider of health care to timely provide
4 a patient with an itemized bill at no additional cost to the patient. (NRS 629.071)
5 Sections 2 and 3 of this bill, respectively, require a medical facility or an entity that
6 bills for care provided by a provider of health care that receives notice from a
7 patient that a medical bill contains one or more overcharges to: (1) respond to the
8 patient concerning the overcharges, including by providing the contact information
9 for the Office for Consumer Health Assistance in the Department of Health and
10 Human Services if the facility or provider does not intend to refund the disputed
11 charge; or (2) notify the patient that more time is needed to investigate the disputed
12 charge. Sections 2 and 3 require the medical facility or billing entity to refund any
13 overpayment by the patient. Sections 2 and 3 provide for the imposition of
14 administrative fines against a medical facility or billing entity that fails to issue
15 such a refund. Sections 2 and 3 require the payment of interest on an overdue
16 refund to a patient from the proceeds of those fines, and sections 5-18 of this bill
-

20 be erroneous and assist consumers in addressing overcharges and overpayments for
21 health care.
