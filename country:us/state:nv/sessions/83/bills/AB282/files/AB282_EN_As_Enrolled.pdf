the bill for his or her care and receive an explanation of the bill. (NRS 449A.106)
Existing law also requires each provider of health care to timely provide a patient with
an itemized bill at no additional cost to the patient. (NRS 629.071) Sections 2 and 3
of this bill, respectively, require a medical facility or an entity that bills for care
provided by a provider of health care that receives notice from a patient that a medical
bill contains one or more overcharges to: (1) respond to the patient concerning the
overcharges, including by providing the contact information for the Office for
Consumer Health Assistance in the Department of Health and Human Services if the
facility or provider does not intend to refund the disputed charge; or (2) notify the
patient that more time is needed to investigate the disputed charge. Sections 2 and 3
require the medical facility or billing entity to refund any overpayment by the patient.
Sections 2 and 3 provide for the imposition of administrative fines against a medical
facility or billing entity that fails to issue such a refund. Section 2.5 of this bill
requires the Governor’s Consumer Health Advocate, who serves as the head of the
Office, to review medical bills that consumers believe to be erroneous and assist
consumers in addressing overcharges and overpayments for health care.
