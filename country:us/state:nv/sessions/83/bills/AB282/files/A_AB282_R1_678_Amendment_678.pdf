bills for care provided by a provider of health care [who] that
receives notice from a patient of an [error] overcharge in a medical
bill to review the potential [error] overcharge and refund any
overpayment; authorizing the imposition of certain [disciplinary
action] administrative fines for the failure to [comply with such
requirements;] issue such a refund within a certain period;
providing for the payment of interest on such unpaid refunds from
the proceeds of such administrative fines; requiring the Governor’s
Consumer Health Advocate to provide certain assistance concerning
[medical billing errors;] overcharges and overpayments for health
care; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides every patient of a medical facility with the right to examine the bill
2 for his or her care and receive an explanation of the bill. (NRS 449A.106) Existing law also
3 requires each provider of health care to timely provide a patient with an itemized bill at no
4 additional cost to the patient. (NRS 629.071) Sections 2 and 3 of this bill, respectively,
5 require a medical facility or an entity that bills for care provided by a provider of health
6 care that receives notice from a patient that a medical bill contains one or more [specific
7 billing errors] overcharges to: (1) respond to the patient concerning the [billing errors,]
8 overcharges, including by providing the contact information for the Office for Consumer
9 Health Assistance in the Department of Health and Human Services if the facility or provider
10 does not intend to refund the disputed charge; or (2) notify the patient that more time is
11 needed to investigate the disputed charge . [is being reviewed.] Sections 2 and 3 require the
12 medical facility or [provider of health care] billing entity to refund any overpayment by the
13 patient. [Section] Sections 2 [requires the State Board of Health to establish by regulation an
14 administrative fine to impose on a medical facility that violates section 2. Section 3
15 authorizes] and 3 provide for the imposition of [disciplinary action] administrative fines
16 against a [provider of health care who] medical facility or billing entity that fails to [comply
17 with the requirements of section 3.] issue such a refund. Sections 2 and 3 require the
18 payment of interest on an overdue refund to a patient from the proceeds of those fines,
19 and sections 5-18 of this bill make conforming changes to allow the use of those proceeds
20 for that purpose. Section 2.5 of this bill requires the Governor’s Consumer Health Advocate,
21 who serves as the head of the Office, to review medical bills that consumers believe to be

Senate Amendment No. 678 to Assembly Bill No. 282 First Reprint Page 4
22 erroneous and assist consumers in addressing [medical billing errors.] overcharges and
23 overpayments for health care.
