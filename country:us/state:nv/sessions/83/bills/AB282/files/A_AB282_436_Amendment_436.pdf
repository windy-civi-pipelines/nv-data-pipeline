2 for his or her care and receive an explanation of the bill. (NRS 449A.106) Existing law also
3 requires each provider of health care to timely provide a patient with an itemized bill at no
4 additional cost to the patient. (NRS 629.071) Sections 2 and 3 of this bill, respectively,
5 require a medical facility or provider of health care that [determines or] receives notice from
6 a patient that a medical bill [may contain] contains one or more specific billing errors to: (1)
7 [review the potential] respond to the patient concerning the billing errors [;] , including by
8 providing the contact information for the Office for Consumer Health Assistance in the
9 Department of Health and Human Services if the facility or provider does not intend to
10 refund the disputed charge; or (2) notify the patient [of the review and the results of the
11 review; and (3) refund any overpayment by the patient. Sections 1 and 4 of this bill,
12 respectively, authorize the suspension or revocation of the license of a medical facility that
13 violates section 2, and the imposition of disciplinary action against and administrator of
14 certain facilities who aids or abets a violation of section 2.] that the disputed charge is being
15 reviewed. Sections 2 and 3 require the medical facility or provider of health care to
16 refund any overpayment by the patient. Section 2 requires the State Board of Health to
17 establish by regulation an administrative fine to impose on a medical facility that
18 violates section 2. Section 3 authorizes the imposition of disciplinary action against a
19 provider of health care who fails to comply with the requirements of section 3. Section 2.5 of
20 this bill requires the Governor’s Consumer Health Advocate, who serves as the head of
21 the Office, to review medical bills that consumers believe to be erroneous and assist
22 consumers in addressing medical billing errors.
