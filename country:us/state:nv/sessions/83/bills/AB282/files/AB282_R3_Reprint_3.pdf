EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; requiring a medical facility or an
entity that bills for care provided by a provider of health
care that receives notice from a patient of an overcharge
in a medical bill to review the potential overcharge and
refund any overpayment; authorizing the imposition of
certain administrative fines for the failure to issue such a
refund within a certain period; requiring the Governor’s
Consumer Health Advocate to provide certain assistance
concerning overcharges and overpayments for health care;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides every patient of a medical facility with the right to examine
2 the bill for his or her care and receive an explanation of the bill. (NRS 449A.106)
3 Existing law also requires each provider of health care to timely provide a patient with
4 an itemized bill at no additional cost to the patient. (NRS 629.071) Sections 2 and 3
5 of this bill, respectively, require a medical facility or an entity that bills for care
6 provided by a provider of health care that receives notice from a patient that a medical
7 bill contains one or more overcharges to: (1) respond to the patient concerning the
8 overcharges, including by providing the contact information for the Office for
9 Consumer Health Assistance in the Department of Health and Human Services if the
10 facility or provider does not intend to refund the disputed charge; or (2) notify the
11 patient that more time is needed to investigate the disputed charge. Sections 2 and 3
12 require the medical facility or billing entity to refund any overpayment by the patient.
13 Sections 2 and 3 provide for the imposition of administrative fines against a medical
14 facility or billing entity that fails to issue such a refund. Section 2.5 of this bill
15 requires the Governor’s Consumer Health Advocate, who serves as the head of the
16 Office, to review medical bills that consumers believe to be erroneous and assist
17 consumers in addressing overcharges and overpayments for health care.
