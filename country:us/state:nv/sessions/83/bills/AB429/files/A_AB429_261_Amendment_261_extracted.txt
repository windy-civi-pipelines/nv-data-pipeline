AN ACT relating to natural resources; providing, with certain exceptions, that any
person is authorized to perform certain actions relating to an easement
for conservation; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes, with certain exceptions, an easement for conservation to be
2 created , conveyed, recorded, assigned, released, modified, terminated or otherwise altered or
3 affected in the same manner as other easements. (NRS 111.420) This bill instead provides that
4 any person, including a state or local government or any agency or instrumentality thereof, is
5 authorized to create, convey, record, assign, release, reserve, modify, terminate or otherwise
6 alter or affect an easement for conservation in the same manner as other easements.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 111.420 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 111.420 1. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 111.390 to 111.440,
3 inclusive, [an] any person, including, without limitation, a state or local
4 government or any agency or instrumentality thereof, may create, convey, record,
5 assign, release, reserve, modify, terminate or otherwise alter or affect an
6 easement for conservation [may be created, conveyed, recorded, assigned, released,
7 modified, terminated or otherwise altered or affected] in the same manner as other
8 easements.
9 2. No right or duty in favor of or against a holder and no right of enforcement
10 in favor of a third person arises under an easement for conservation before it is
11 accepted by the holder and the acceptance is recorded.
12 3. An easement for conservation is unlimited in duration unless:
13 (a) The instrument creating it otherwise provides; or
14 (b) A court orders that the easement be terminated or modified, according to
15 subsection 2 of NRS 111.430.
