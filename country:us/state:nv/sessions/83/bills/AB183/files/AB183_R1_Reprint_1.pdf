Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law governs the practice of optometry, including, without limitation,
2 the licensing of optometrists by the Nevada State Board of Optometry. (Chapter
3 636 of NRS) Section 2 of this bill provides that: (1) the purpose of licensing
4 optometrists is to protect the public health and safety and general welfare of the
5 people of this State; and (2) any license issued by the Board is a revocable
6 privilege.
7 Section 3 of this bill establishes procedures by which the Board may
8 summarily suspend the license of a licensee to practice optometry under certain
9 circumstances.
10 Section 5 of this bill revises the definition of the term “pharmaceutical agent”
11 for the purposes of provisions governing the practice of optometry to specify that
12 the term includes any drug subject to certain provisions restricting the prescription
13 of controlled substances or added to schedule III, schedule IV or schedule V by the
14 State Board of Pharmacy by regulation.
15 Section 6 of this bill increases the number of members of the Nevada State
16 Board of Optometry from four members to five.
17 Existing law requires the Governor to appoint to the Board: (1) three members
18 who are licensed to practice optometry in this State and are actually engaged in that
19 practice; and (2) one member who is a representative of the general public. (NRS
20 636.035) Section 7 of this bill increases the number of members who are licensees
21 who the Governor must appoint from three members to four members.
22 Existing law authorizes the Board to issue a license by endorsement to certain
23 persons who hold a corresponding valid, active and unrestricted license to engage
24 in the practice of optometry in the District of Columbia or any state or territory of
25 the United States and who meet certain other requirements. (NRS 636.206) Section
26 8 of this bill requires an applicant for a license by endorsement to submit to the
27 Board with his or her application proof satisfactory to the Board that the applicant
28 has passed each part of the comprehensive national optometry examination
29 administered by the National Board of Examiners in Optometry or its successor as a
30 prerequisite to the issuance of the applicant’s corresponding, valid, active and
31 unrestricted license from the other jurisdiction.
32 Existing law requires the Board to adopt regulations which prescribe the
33 requirements for certification to administer and prescribe certain pharmaceutical
34 agents and sets forth certain requirements for inclusion in those regulations. (NRS
35 636.287) Section 9 of this bill eliminates the requirement that an applicant for
36 certification have successfully completed not fewer than 40 hours of clinical
37 training in administering and prescribing pharmaceutical agents in a training
38 program which is conducted by an ophthalmologist and approved by the Board.
39 Existing law prohibits an optometrist who is certified to administer and
40 prescribe certain pharmaceutical agents from prescribing a controlled substance
41 unless certain conditions are satisfied, including, without limitation, the
42 requirement that the optometrist prescribes the controlled substance in an amount
43 that does not exceed 90 morphine milligram equivalents per day and will not last
44 more than 72 hours. (NRS 636.2882) Section 9.5 of this bill specifies that this
45 requirement is applicable only to the prescription of a narcotic opioid analgesic.
46 Existing law requires the Board to adopt regulations that prescribe the
47 requirements for the issuance of a certificate to treat persons diagnosed with
48 glaucoma. Existing law requires those requirements to include, among other
49 requirements, proof that each optometrist who applies for such a certificate has
50 treated at least 15 persons who were diagnosed with glaucoma by an
51 ophthalmologist licensed in this State. (NRS 636.2893) Section 10 of this bill
52 revises that requirement to specify that such persons diagnosed with glaucoma must
53 have been diagnosed by an ophthalmologist licensed in this State, the District of
54 Columbia or any other state or territory of the United States.

55 Existing law requires the Board to cause any complaint filed with the Board to
56 be investigated if the Executive Director of the Board determines the complaint is
57 not frivolous and alleges on or more grounds for disciplinary action. (NRS
58 636.305) Section 11 of this bill authorizes the Board to issue orders to aid such an
59 investigation, including, without limitation, an order compelling a licensee to
60 appear before the Board or an investigative committee of the Board.
61 Existing law provides that a person who is licensed to practice optometry
62 pursuant to chapter 636 of NRS is authorized and entitled to practice optometry in
63 this State subject to the provisions of that chapter. (NRS 636.345) Section 12 of
64 this bill clarifies that the practice of optometry includes optometric telemedicine.
65 Existing law authorizes an assistant in any setting where optometry is practiced
66 to perform certain activities if the assistant acts under the direct supervision of a
67 licensed optometrist. (NRS 636.346) Section 13 of this bill clarifies that an
68 assistant is authorized to perform those same activities under the direct supervision
69 of a licensed optometrist in any setting where optometric telemedicine is practiced.
70 Existing law requires a licensee to report to the Board within 30 days the
71 revocation, suspension or surrender of, or any disciplinary action taken against, a
72 license, certificate or registration to practice any occupation or profession issued by
73 any other jurisdiction. (NRS 636.371) Section 14 of this bill provides an exception
74 to this duty, providing that a licensee is not required to report to the Board an
75 administrative fine imposed by a regulatory board or other equivalent
76 administrative body of any other jurisdiction if: (1) the National Practitioner Data
77 Bank contains no corresponding report of the administrative fine; and (2) the
78 regulatory board or other administrative body that imposed the fine did not issue an
79 order of formal disciplinary action relating to the act or acts which served as the
80 basis for the fine.
81 Existing law authorizes a surviving family member of a licensed optometrist
82 who died and was the sole owner of an optometry practice to own the practice
83 without holding a license to practice optometry in this State for not more than 1
84 year after the death of the licensed optometrist. (NRS 636.398) Section 15 of this
85 bill authorizes a guardian or guardian ad litem who is appointed for a licensed
86 optometrist who is permanently incapacitated and was the sole owner of an
87 optometry practice to own the practice without holding a license to practice
88 optometry in this State for not more than 1 year after the appointment of
89 guardianship.
90 Existing law authorizes the Board to issue a citation to a licensee or other
91 person who violates certain provisions of law governing the practice of optometry.
92 (NRS 636.420) Section 16 of this bill authorizes the issuance of a citation only for
93 violations not involving: (1) the care of a patient; or (2) unethical or unprofessional
94 conduct. Section 16 also provides that the issuance of a citation and the imposition
95 of an administrative fine against a licensee for certain violations: (1) do not
96 constitute formal disciplinary action by the Board; and (2) must not be reported to
97 the National Practitioner Data Bank.
