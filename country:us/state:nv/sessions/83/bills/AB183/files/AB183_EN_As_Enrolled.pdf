Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law governs the practice of optometry, including, without limitation,
the licensing of optometrists by the Nevada State Board of Optometry. (Chapter
636 of NRS) Section 2 of this bill provides that: (1) the purpose of licensing
optometrists is to protect the public health and safety and general welfare of the
people of this State; and (2) any license issued by the Board is a revocable
privilege.
Section 3 of this bill establishes procedures by which the Board may
summarily suspend the license of a licensee to practice optometry under certain
circumstances.
Section 5 of this bill revises the definition of the term “pharmaceutical agent”
for the purposes of provisions governing the practice of optometry to specify that
the term includes any drug subject to certain provisions restricting the prescription

State Board of Pharmacy by regulation.

Existing law authorizes the Board to issue a license by endorsement to certain
persons who hold a corresponding valid, active and unrestricted license to engage
in the practice of optometry in the District of Columbia or any state or territory of
the United States and who meet certain other requirements. (NRS 636.206) Section
8 of this bill requires an applicant for a license by endorsement to submit to the
Board with his or her application proof satisfactory to the Board that the applicant
has passed each part of the comprehensive national optometry examination
administered by the National Board of Examiners in Optometry or its successor as a
prerequisite to the issuance of the applicant’s corresponding, valid, active and
unrestricted license from the other jurisdiction.
Existing law requires the Board to adopt regulations which prescribe the
requirements for certification to administer and prescribe certain pharmaceutical
agents and sets forth certain requirements for inclusion in those regulations. (NRS
636.287) Section 9 of this bill eliminates the requirement that an applicant for
certification have successfully completed not fewer than 40 hours of clinical
training in administering and prescribing pharmaceutical agents in a training
program which is conducted by an ophthalmologist and approved by the Board.
Existing law prohibits an optometrist who is certified to administer and
prescribe certain pharmaceutical agents from prescribing a controlled substance
unless certain conditions are satisfied, including, without limitation, the
requirement that the optometrist prescribes the controlled substance in an amount
that does not exceed 90 morphine milligram equivalents per day and will not last
more than 72 hours. (NRS 636.2882) Section 9.5 of this bill specifies that this
requirement is applicable only to the prescription of a narcotic opioid analgesic.
Existing law requires the Board to adopt regulations that prescribe the
requirements for the issuance of a certificate to treat persons diagnosed with
glaucoma. Existing law requires those requirements to include, among other
requirements, proof that each optometrist who applies for such a certificate has
treated at least 15 persons who were diagnosed with glaucoma by an
ophthalmologist licensed in this State. (NRS 636.2893) Section 10 of this bill
revises that requirement to specify that such persons diagnosed with glaucoma must
have been diagnosed by an ophthalmologist licensed in this State, the District of
Columbia or any other state or territory of the United States.
Existing law requires the Board to cause any complaint filed with the Board to
be investigated if the Executive Director of the Board determines the complaint is
not frivolous and alleges on or more grounds for disciplinary action. (NRS
636.305) Section 11 of this bill authorizes the Board to issue orders to aid such an
investigation, including, without limitation, an order compelling a licensee to
appear before the Board or an investigative committee of the Board.
Existing law provides that a person who is licensed to practice optometry
pursuant to chapter 636 of NRS is authorized and entitled to practice optometry in
this State subject to the provisions of that chapter. (NRS 636.345) Section 12 of
this bill clarifies that the practice of optometry includes optometric telemedicine.
Existing law authorizes an assistant in any setting where optometry is practiced
to perform certain activities if the assistant acts under the direct supervision of a
licensed optometrist. (NRS 636.346) Section 13 of this bill clarifies that an
assistant is authorized to perform those same activities under the direct supervision
of a licensed optometrist in any setting where optometric telemedicine is practiced.
Existing law requires a licensee to report to the Board within 30 days the
revocation, suspension or surrender of, or any disciplinary action taken against, a
license, certificate or registration to practice any occupation or profession issued by
any other jurisdiction. (NRS 636.371) Section 14 of this bill provides an exception
to this duty, providing that a licensee is not required to report to the Board an
-

administrative fine imposed by a regulatory board or other equivalent
administrative body of any other jurisdiction if: (1) the National Practitioner Data
Bank contains no corresponding report of the administrative fine; and (2) the
regulatory board or other administrative body that imposed the fine did not issue an
order of formal disciplinary action relating to the act or acts which served as the
basis for the fine.
Existing law authorizes a surviving family member of a licensed optometrist
who died and was the sole owner of an optometry practice to own the practice
without holding a license to practice optometry in this State for not more than 1
year after the death of the licensed optometrist. (NRS 636.398) Section 15 of this
bill authorizes a guardian or guardian ad litem who is appointed for a licensed
optometrist who is permanently incapacitated and was the sole owner of an
optometry practice to own the practice without holding a license to practice
optometry in this State for not more than 1 year after the appointment of
guardianship.
Existing law authorizes the Board to issue a citation to a licensee or other
person who violates certain provisions of law governing the practice of optometry.
(NRS 636.420) Section 16 of this bill authorizes the issuance of a citation only for
violations not involving: (1) the care of a patient; or (2) unethical or unprofessional
conduct. Section 16 also provides that the issuance of a citation and the imposition
of an administrative fine against a licensee for certain violations: (1) do not
constitute formal disciplinary action by the Board; and (2) must not be reported to
the National Practitioner Data Bank.
