Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law governs the practice of optometry, including, without limitation, the
2 licensing of optometrists by the Nevada State Board of Optometry. (Chapter 636 of NRS)
3 Section 2 of this bill provides that: (1) the purpose of licensing optometrists is to protect the
4 public health and safety and general welfare of the people of this State; and (2) any license
5 issued by the Board is a revocable privilege.
6 Section 3 of this bill establishes procedures by which the Board may summarily suspend
7 the license of a licensee to practice optometry under certain circumstances.
8 [Section 4 of this bill prohibits a court from staying an order of the Board suspending the
9 license of a licensee pending proceedings for disciplinary action.]
10 Section 5 of this bill revises the definition of the term “pharmaceutical agent” for the
11 purposes of provisions governing the practice of optometry to specify that the term includes
12 [certain non-analgesic drugs.] any drug subject to certain provisions restricting the

Assembly Amendment No. 67 to Assembly Bill No. 183 Page 4
13 prescription of controlled substances or added to schedule III, schedule IV or schedule V
14 by the State Board of Pharmacy by regulation.
15 Section 6 of this bill increases the number of members of the Nevada State Board of
16 Optometry from four members to five.
17 Existing law requires the Governor to appoint to the Board: (1) three members who are
18 licensed to practice optometry in this State and are actually engaged in that practice; and (2)
19 one member who is a representative of the general public. (NRS 636.035) Section 7 of this
20 bill increases the number of members who are licensees who the Governor must appoint from
21 three members to four members.
22 Existing law authorizes the Board to issue a license by endorsement to certain persons
23 who hold a corresponding valid, active and unrestricted license to engage in the practice of
24 optometry in the District of Columbia or any state or territory of the United States and who
25 meet certain other requirements. (NRS 636.206) Section 8 of this bill requires an applicant for
26 a license by endorsement to submit to the Board with his or her application proof satisfactory
27 to the Board that the applicant has passed each part of the comprehensive national optometry
28 examination administered by the National Board of Examiners in Optometry or its successor
29 as a prerequisite to the issuance of the applicant’s corresponding, valid, active and unrestricted
30 license from the other jurisdiction.
31 Existing law requires the Board to adopt regulations which prescribe the requirements for
32 certification to administer and prescribe certain pharmaceutical agents and sets forth certain
33 requirements for inclusion in those regulations. (NRS 636.287) Section 9 of this bill
34 eliminates the requirement that an applicant for certification have successfully completed not
35 fewer than 40 hours of clinical training in administering and prescribing pharmaceutical
36 agents in a training program which is conducted by an ophthalmologist and approved by the
37 Board.
38 Existing law prohibits an optometrist who is certified to administer and prescribe
39 certain pharmaceutical agents from prescribing a controlled substance unless certain
40 conditions are satisfied, including, without limitation, the requirement that the
41 optometrist prescribes the controlled substance in an amount that does not exceed 90
42 morphine milligram equivalents per day and will not last more than 72 hours. (NRS
43 636.2882) Section 9.5 of this bill specifies that this requirement is applicable only to the
44 prescription of a narcotic opioid analgesic.
45 Existing law requires the Board to adopt regulations that prescribe the requirements for
46 the issuance of a certificate to treat persons diagnosed with glaucoma. Existing law requires
47 those requirements to include, among other requirements, proof that each optometrist who
48 applies for such a certificate has treated at least 15 persons who were diagnosed with
49 glaucoma by an ophthalmologist licensed in this State. (NRS 636.2893) Section 10 of this bill
50 revises that requirement to specify that such persons diagnosed with glaucoma must have been
51 diagnosed by an ophthalmologist licensed in this State, the District of Columbia or any other
52 state or territory of the United States.
53 Existing law requires the Board to cause any complaint filed with the Board to be
54 investigated if the Executive Director of the Board determines the complaint is not frivolous
55 and alleges on or more grounds for disciplinary action. (NRS 636.305) Section 11 of this bill
56 authorizes the Board to issue orders to aid such an investigation, including, without limitation,
57 an order compelling a licensee to appear before the Board or an investigative committee of the
58 Board.
59 Existing law provides that a person who is licensed to practice optometry pursuant to
60 chapter 636 of NRS is authorized and entitled to practice optometry in this State subject to the
61 provisions of that chapter. (NRS 636.345) Section 12 of this bill clarifies that the practice of
62 optometry includes optometric telemedicine.
63 Existing law authorizes an assistant in any setting where optometry is practiced to
64 perform certain activities if the assistant acts under the direct supervision of a licensed
65 optometrist. (NRS 636.346) Section 13 of this bill clarifies that an assistant is authorized to
66 perform those same activities under the direct supervision of a licensed optometrist in any
67 setting where optometric telemedicine is practiced.
68 Existing law requires a licensee to report to the Board within 30 days the revocation,
69 suspension or surrender of, or any disciplinary action taken against, a license, certificate or
70 registration to practice any occupation or profession issued by any other jurisdiction. (NRS
71 636.371) Section 14 of this bill provides an exception to this duty, providing that a licensee is

Assembly Amendment No. 67 to Assembly Bill No. 183 Page 5
72 not required to report to the Board an administrative fine imposed by a regulatory board or
73 other equivalent administrative body of any other jurisdiction if: (1) the National Practitioner
74 Data Bank contains no corresponding report of the administrative fine; and (2) the regulatory
75 board or other administrative body that imposed the fine did not issue an order of formal
76 disciplinary action relating to the act or acts which served as the basis for the fine.
77 Existing law authorizes a surviving family member of a licensed optometrist who died
78 and was the sole owner of an optometry practice to own the practice without holding a license
79 to practice optometry in this State for not more than 1 year after the death of the licensed
80 optometrist. (NRS 636.398) Section 15 of this bill authorizes a guardian or guardian ad litem
81 who is appointed for a licensed optometrist who is permanently incapacitated and was the sole
82 owner of an optometry practice to own the practice without holding a license to practice
83 optometry in this State for not more than 1 year after the appointment of guardianship.
84 Existing law authorizes the Board to issue a citation to a licensee or other person who
85 violates certain provisions of law governing the practice of optometry. (NRS 636.420) Section
86 16 of this bill authorizes the issuance of a citation only for violations not involving: (1) the
87 care of a patient; or (2) unethical or unprofessional conduct. Section 16 also provides that the
88 issuance of a citation and the imposition of an administrative fine against a licensee for certain
89 violations: (1) do not constitute formal disciplinary action by the Board; and (2) must not be
90 reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank.
