AN ACT relating to taxation; revising provisions governing the
taxation of remote sales of cigars and pipe tobacco;
revising provisions governing the licensing of remote
retail sellers of cigars and pipe tobacco; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law imposes a tax on the receipt, purchase or sale in this State of
2 cigarettes and other tobacco products, including, without limitation, cigars and pipe
3 tobacco. (NRS 370.0318, 370.165, 370.350, 370.440, 370.450) Under existing law,
4 the tax on tobacco products, other than cigarettes, is required to be paid by the
5 wholesale dealer who purchased the products from the manufacturer and who
6 distributes the products to a retail dealer in this State. If any tobacco products, other
7 than cigarettes, are authorized by law to be sold directly to a consumer in this State
8 by a person located outside this State, the tax is imposed on the person making the
9 sale and the tax is based on the established price for which the products are sold to
10 the consumer. (NRS 370.440, 370.450)
11 This bill enacts provisions to provide for the taxation of the remote sale of
12 cigars and pipe tobacco by persons who make sales of cigars and pipe tobacco
13 through any means by which the cigars or pipe tobacco are delivered to the
14 consumer through the mail or another delivery service. Section 8 of this bill
15 requires the tax for a remote sale of cigars or pipe tobacco to be based on the actual
16 cost of the cigars or pipe tobacco to the remote retail seller, as defined in section 6
17 of this bill. Section 9 of this bill provides for the filing of a monthly report of the
18 sales of cigars and pipe tobacco by a remote retail seller in a manner similar to the
19 monthly report for a wholesale dealer of such products, and section 10 of this bill
20 imposes recordkeeping requirements on a remote retail seller of cigars and pipe
21 tobacco that are similar to the recordkeeping requirements for a wholesale dealer of
22 such products. Section 11 of this bill excludes remote retail sellers of cigars and
23 pipe tobacco from obtaining the credit provided under existing law for the cost of
24 collecting taxes on tobacco products. Sections 2, 3 and 12-19 of this bill provide
-
*AB471*
– 2 –
25 for the licensing of remote retail sellers of cigars and pipe tobacco in the same
26 manner as wholesale dealers of such products, including, without limitation,
27 imposing the same fees for a license, which are set forth in section 18, and
28 imposing the same bonding requirements, which are set forth in section 19. Section
29 7 of this bill clarifies requirements for wholesale dealers of tobacco products, other
30 than cigarettes, to maintain an inventory of such products by providing that such
31 inventory must be maintained at each location in this State at which the wholesaler
32 maintains a place of business. Section 20 of this bill makes a conforming change to
33 align with existing requirements for the use of an independent, third-party age
34 verification service by remote retail sellers of certain tobacco products.

REQUIRES TWO-THIRDS MAJORITY VOTE
(§§ 8, 14, 18)
A.B. 471
ASSEMBLY BILL NO. 471–ASSEMBLYMEMBER HIBBETTS
MARCH 17, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Revenue
SUMMARY—Revises provisions governing remote sales of certain
tobacco products. (BDR 32-846)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to taxation; revising provisions governing the
taxation of remote sales of cigars and pipe tobacco;
revising provisions governing the licensing of remote
retail sellers of cigars and pipe tobacco; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law imposes a tax on the receipt, purchase or sale in this State of
2 cigarettes and other tobacco products, including, without limitation, cigars and pipe
3 tobacco. (NRS 370.0318, 370.165, 370.350, 370.440, 370.450) Under existing law,
4 the tax on tobacco products, other than cigarettes, is required to be paid by the
5 wholesale dealer who purchased the products from the manufacturer and who
6 distributes the products to a retail dealer in this State. If any tobacco products, other
7 than cigarettes, are authorized by law to be sold directly to a consumer in this State
8 by a person located outside this State, the tax is imposed on the person making the
9 sale and the tax is based on the established price for which the products are sold to
10 the consumer. (NRS 370.440, 370.450)
11 This bill enacts provisions to provide for the taxation of the remote sale of
12 cigars and pipe tobacco by persons who make sales of cigars and pipe tobacco
13 through any means by which the cigars or pipe tobacco are delivered to the
14 consumer through the mail or another delivery service. Section 8 of this bill
15 requires the tax for a remote sale of cigars or pipe tobacco to be based on the actual
16 cost of the cigars or pipe tobacco to the remote retail seller, as defined in section 6
17 of this bill. Section 9 of this bill provides for the filing of a monthly report of the
18 sales of cigars and pipe tobacco by a remote retail seller in a manner similar to the
19 monthly report for a wholesale dealer of such products, and section 10 of this bill
20 imposes recordkeeping requirements on a remote retail seller of cigars and pipe
21 tobacco that are similar to the recordkeeping requirements for a wholesale dealer of
22 such products. Section 11 of this bill excludes remote retail sellers of cigars and
23 pipe tobacco from obtaining the credit provided under existing law for the cost of
24 collecting taxes on tobacco products. Sections 2, 3 and 12-19 of this bill provide
-
*AB471*

– 2 –
25 for the licensing of remote retail sellers of cigars and pipe tobacco in the same
26 manner as wholesale dealers of such products, including, without limitation,
27 imposing the same fees for a license, which are set forth in section 18, and
28 imposing the same bonding requirements, which are set forth in section 19. Section
29 7 of this bill clarifies requirements for wholesale dealers of tobacco products, other
30 than cigarettes, to maintain an inventory of such products by providing that such
31 inventory must be maintained at each location in this State at which the wholesaler
32 maintains a place of business. Section 20 of this bill makes a conforming change to
33 align with existing requirements for the use of an independent, third-party age
34 verification service by remote retail sellers of certain tobacco products.
