CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to taxation; revising provisions governing the
taxation of remote sales of cigars and pipe tobacco; revising
provisions governing the licensing of remote retail sellers of
cigars and pipe tobacco; revising provisions governing age
verification for remote retail sales of certain tobacco

providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law imposes a tax on the receipt, purchase or sale in this State of
cigarettes and other tobacco products, including, without limitation, cigars and pipe
tobacco. (NRS 370.0318, 370.165, 370.350, 370.440, 370.450) Under existing law,
the tax on tobacco products, other than cigarettes, is required to be paid by the
wholesale dealer who purchased the products from the manufacturer and who
distributes the products to a retail dealer in this State. If any tobacco products, other
than cigarettes, are authorized by law to be sold directly to a consumer in this State
by a person located outside this State, the tax is imposed on the person making the
sale and the tax is based on the established price for which the products are sold to
the consumer. (NRS 370.440, 370.450)
This bill enacts provisions to provide for the taxation of the remote sale of
cigars and pipe tobacco by persons who make sales of cigars and pipe tobacco
through any means by which the cigars or pipe tobacco are delivered to the
consumer through remote sales. Sections 2 and 3 of this bill, respectively, define
the sales that constitute a remote retail sale and the sellers who are remote retail
sellers for the purposes of taxing such remote retail sales of cigars and pipe
tobacco. Section 3.3 of this bill requires the tax for a remote sale of cigars or pipe
tobacco to be based on the actual cost of the cigars or pipe tobacco to the remote
retail seller, as defined in section 1.3 of this bill. Under section 3.3, a remote retail
seller is subject to this tax only if the remote retail seller meets certain thresholds
for the retail sale of cigars or pipe tobacco to consumers in this State. Section 3.4 of
this bill provides for the filing of a monthly report of the sales of cigars and pipe
tobacco by a remote retail seller in a manner similar to the monthly report for a
wholesale dealer of such products, and section 3.5 of this bill imposes
recordkeeping requirements on a remote retail seller of cigars and pipe tobacco that
are similar to the recordkeeping requirements for a wholesale dealer of such
products. Sections 3.6-3.9 of this bill provide for the licensing of remote retail
sellers of cigars and pipe tobacco in the same manner as wholesale dealers of such
products. Specifically: (1) section 3.65 prohibits the issuance, maintenance or
renewal of a license if the applicant or licensee is not registered to collect and remit
sales and use tax, is delinquent in the payment of sales and use tax or the tax
imposed by section 3.3, or does not comply with certain age-verification
requirements; (2) section 3.8 imposes the same fees for a license that are imposed
on similar tobacco licensees; and (3) section 3.9 imposes the same bonding
requirements that are imposed on similar tobacco licensees. Section 7 of this bill
clarifies requirements for wholesale dealers of tobacco products, other than
cigarettes, to maintain an inventory of such products by providing that such
inventory must be maintained at each location in this State at which the wholesaler
maintains a place of business. Section 12.5 of this bill makes a remote retail seller
-

subject to the penalties that apply under existing law to delinquency in the payment
of taxes on tobacco products. (NRS 370.523) Section 20 of this bill makes a
conforming change to align with existing requirements for the use of an
independent, third-party age verification service by remote retail sellers of certain
tobacco products. Section 20.5 of this bill makes a conforming change to ensure
premium cigars sold to a remote retail seller are taxed in the same manner as
premium cigars sold by other retail sellers in this State. Section 20.7 of this bill
makes an appropriation to the Department of Taxation for certain costs to
implement the provisions of this bill.
