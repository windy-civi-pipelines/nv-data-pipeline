EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to taxation; revising provisions governing the taxation of remote
sales of cigars and pipe tobacco; revising provisions governing the
licensing of remote retail sellers of cigars and pipe tobacco; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law imposes a tax on the receipt, purchase or sale in this State of cigarettes and
2 other tobacco products, including, without limitation, cigars and pipe tobacco. (NRS
3 370.0318, 370.165, 370.350, 370.440, 370.450) Under existing law, the tax on tobacco
4 products, other than cigarettes, is required to be paid by the wholesale dealer who purchased
5 the products from the manufacturer and who distributes the products to a retail dealer in this
6 State. If any tobacco products, other than cigarettes, are authorized by law to be sold directly
7 to a consumer in this State by a person located outside this State, the tax is imposed on the
8 person making the sale and the tax is based on the established price for which the products are
9 sold to the consumer. (NRS 370.440, 370.450)
10 This bill enacts provisions to provide for the taxation of the remote sale of cigars and pipe
11 tobacco by persons who make sales of cigars and pipe tobacco through any means by which
12 the cigars or pipe tobacco are delivered to the consumer through [the mail or another delivery
13 service.] remote sales. Sections 2 and 3 of this bill, respectively, define the sales that
14 constitute a remote retail sale and the sellers who are remote retail sellers for the
15 purposes of taxing such remote retail sales of cigars and pipe tobacco. Section [8] 3.3 of
16 this bill requires the tax for a remote sale of cigars or pipe tobacco to be based on the actual
17 cost of the cigars or pipe tobacco to the remote retail seller, as defined in section [6] 1.3 of
18 this bill. Section [9] 3.4 of this bill provides for the filing of a monthly report of the sales of
19 cigars and pipe tobacco by a remote retail seller in a manner similar to the monthly report for
20 a wholesale dealer of such products, and section [10] 3.5 of this bill imposes recordkeeping
21 requirements on a remote retail seller of cigars and pipe tobacco that are similar to the
22 recordkeeping requirements for a wholesale dealer of such products. [Section 11 of this bill
23 excludes remote retail sellers of cigars and pipe tobacco from obtaining the credit provided
24 under existing law for the cost of collecting taxes on tobacco products.] Sections [2, 3 and 12-
25 19] 3.6-3.9 of this bill provide for the licensing of remote retail sellers of cigars and pipe
26 tobacco in the same manner as wholesale dealers of such products, including, without
27 limitation, imposing the same fees for a license, which are set forth in section [18,] 3.8 and
28 imposing the same bonding requirements, which are set forth in section [19.] 3.9. Section 7 of
29 this bill clarifies requirements for wholesale dealers of tobacco products, other than cigarettes,

Assembly Amendment No. 370 to Assembly Bill No. 471 Page 4
30 to maintain an inventory of such products by providing that such inventory must be
31 maintained at each location in this State at which the wholesaler maintains a place of business.
32 Section 20 of this bill makes a conforming change to align with existing requirements for the
33 use of an independent, third-party age verification service by remote retail sellers of certain
34 tobacco products.
