EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to taxation; revising provisions governing the
taxation of remote sales of cigars and pipe tobacco;
revising provisions governing the licensing of remote
retail sellers of cigars and pipe tobacco; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law imposes a tax on the receipt, purchase or sale in this State of
2 cigarettes and other tobacco products, including, without limitation, cigars and pipe
3 tobacco. (NRS 370.0318, 370.165, 370.350, 370.440, 370.450) Under existing law,
4 the tax on tobacco products, other than cigarettes, is required to be paid by the
5 wholesale dealer who purchased the products from the manufacturer and who
6 distributes the products to a retail dealer in this State. If any tobacco products, other
7 than cigarettes, are authorized by law to be sold directly to a consumer in this State
8 by a person located outside this State, the tax is imposed on the person making the
9 sale and the tax is based on the established price for which the products are sold to
10 the consumer. (NRS 370.440, 370.450)
11 This bill enacts provisions to provide for the taxation of the remote sale of
12 cigars and pipe tobacco by persons who make sales of cigars and pipe tobacco
13 through any means by which the cigars or pipe tobacco are delivered to the
14 consumer through remote sales. Sections 2 and 3 of this bill, respectively, define
15 the sales that constitute a remote retail sale and the sellers who are remote retail
16 sellers for the purposes of taxing such remote retail sales of cigars and pipe
17 tobacco. Section 3.3 of this bill requires the tax for a remote sale of cigars or pipe
18 tobacco to be based on the actual cost of the cigars or pipe tobacco to the remote
19 retail seller, as defined in section 1.3 of this bill. Section 3.4 of this bill provides
20 for the filing of a monthly report of the sales of cigars and pipe tobacco by a remote
21 retail seller in a manner similar to the monthly report for a wholesale dealer of such
22 products, and section 3.5 of this bill imposes recordkeeping requirements on a
-
*AB471_R1*
– 2 –
23 remote retail seller of cigars and pipe tobacco that are similar to the recordkeeping
24 requirements for a wholesale dealer of such products. Sections 3.6-3.9 of this bill
25 provide for the licensing of remote retail sellers of cigars and pipe tobacco in the
26 same manner as wholesale dealers of such products, including, without limitation,
27 imposing the same fees for a license, which are set forth in section 3.8 and
28 imposing the same bonding requirements, which are set forth in section 3.9.
29 Section 7 of this bill clarifies requirements for wholesale dealers of tobacco
30 products, other than cigarettes, to maintain an inventory of such products by
31 providing that such inventory must be maintained at each location in this State at
32 which the wholesaler maintains a place of business. Section 20 of this bill makes a
33 conforming change to align with existing requirements for the use of an
34 independent, third-party age verification service by remote retail sellers of certain
35 tobacco products.

SUMMARY—Revises provisions governing remote sales of certain
tobacco products. (BDR 32-846)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to taxation; revising provisions governing the
taxation of remote sales of cigars and pipe tobacco;
revising provisions governing the licensing of remote
retail sellers of cigars and pipe tobacco; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law imposes a tax on the receipt, purchase or sale in this State of
2 cigarettes and other tobacco products, including, without limitation, cigars and pipe
3 tobacco. (NRS 370.0318, 370.165, 370.350, 370.440, 370.450) Under existing law,
4 the tax on tobacco products, other than cigarettes, is required to be paid by the
5 wholesale dealer who purchased the products from the manufacturer and who
6 distributes the products to a retail dealer in this State. If any tobacco products, other
7 than cigarettes, are authorized by law to be sold directly to a consumer in this State
8 by a person located outside this State, the tax is imposed on the person making the
9 sale and the tax is based on the established price for which the products are sold to
10 the consumer. (NRS 370.440, 370.450)
11 This bill enacts provisions to provide for the taxation of the remote sale of
12 cigars and pipe tobacco by persons who make sales of cigars and pipe tobacco
13 through any means by which the cigars or pipe tobacco are delivered to the
14 consumer through remote sales. Sections 2 and 3 of this bill, respectively, define
15 the sales that constitute a remote retail sale and the sellers who are remote retail
16 sellers for the purposes of taxing such remote retail sales of cigars and pipe
17 tobacco. Section 3.3 of this bill requires the tax for a remote sale of cigars or pipe
18 tobacco to be based on the actual cost of the cigars or pipe tobacco to the remote
19 retail seller, as defined in section 1.3 of this bill. Section 3.4 of this bill provides
20 for the filing of a monthly report of the sales of cigars and pipe tobacco by a remote
21 retail seller in a manner similar to the monthly report for a wholesale dealer of such
22 products, and section 3.5 of this bill imposes recordkeeping requirements on a
-
*AB471_R1*

– 2 –
23 remote retail seller of cigars and pipe tobacco that are similar to the recordkeeping
24 requirements for a wholesale dealer of such products. Sections 3.6-3.9 of this bill
25 provide for the licensing of remote retail sellers of cigars and pipe tobacco in the
26 same manner as wholesale dealers of such products, including, without limitation,
27 imposing the same fees for a license, which are set forth in section 3.8 and
28 imposing the same bonding requirements, which are set forth in section 3.9.
29 Section 7 of this bill clarifies requirements for wholesale dealers of tobacco
30 products, other than cigarettes, to maintain an inventory of such products by
31 providing that such inventory must be maintained at each location in this State at
32 which the wholesaler maintains a place of business. Section 20 of this bill makes a
33 conforming change to align with existing requirements for the use of an
34 independent, third-party age verification service by remote retail sellers of certain
35 tobacco products.

16 bond must be in a principal sum equal to the largest amount of tax
17 precollected by the remote retail seller in any quarter of the
18 preceding year. If the information to establish that amount is not
19 available, then the bond must be in a sum required from a licensee
20 operating under conditions deemed comparable by the
21 Department. No bond may be for less than $1,000. When cash is
22 used, the amount must be rounded up to the next larger integral
23 multiple of $100.

26 required by subsection 1, based on the record of taxes remitted by

33 4. A remote retail seller is not entitled to a refund of any
