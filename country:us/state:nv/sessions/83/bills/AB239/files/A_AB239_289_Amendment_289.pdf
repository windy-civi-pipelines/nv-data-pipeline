Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth various provisions governing business entities, including private
2 corporations and limited-liability companies. (Chapters 78 and 86 of NRS) This bill makes
3 various changes to business entities.
4 Section 1 of this bill clarifies that the inclusion of certain materials provided with a notice
5 or other communication by a business entity are deemed to be part of the notice or
6 communication. Section 1.5 of this bill authorizes the articles of incorporation of a
7 corporation to require certain internal actions to be tried before a judge and not a jury.
8 Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change relating to the fiduciary duties of directors
9 and officers of a private corporation for consistency within existing law.

Assembly Amendment No. 289 to Assembly Bill No. 239 Page 4
10 Sections 3 and 4 of this bill require that votes relating to the approval of a reverse stock
11 split be approved by the vote of the relevant stockholders of such a class or series of stock.
12 Sections 5 and 9 of this bill remove the phrase “share dividend” from provisions governing
13 the issuance of shares of a private corporation. Section 5.5 of this bill sets forth provisions
14 relating to the fiduciary duties of certain stockholders of a corporation, limits the
15 individual liability of a stockholder of a corporation under certain circumstances and
16 defines certain terms for such purposes.
17 Section 6 of this bill authorizes a board of directors of a private corporation to take
18 certain actions in final form or such preliminary form as the directors deem appropriate in
19 their business judgment.
20 Section 7 of this bill: (1) provides that voting agreements entered into by stockholders
21 may include a private corporation; and (2) makes conforming changes authorizing the
22 reference in such an agreement to facts or events outside of the agreement as provided in
23 existing law. Section 8 of this bill: (1) provides that a proposed amendment to the articles of
24 incorporation of a private corporation after the issuance of stock that designates one or more
25 new series of an existing class does not adversely alter or change the preferences or rights of
26 the existing series; and (2) authorizes a publicly traded corporation to amend its articles of
27 incorporation to increase or decrease the shares it is authorized to issue through a stockholder
28 vote.
29 Section 11 of this bill clarifies the notice required if the approval of a dissolution of a
30 corporation was obtained by written consent and replaces the phrase “certificate of
31 dissolution” with “articles of dissolution” for purposes of provisions relating to the dissolution
32 of a corporation. Sections 10-12, 15 and 18-21 of this bill make conforming changes to
33 reference “articles of dissolution” for purposes of provisions relating to the dissolution of a
34 corporation or a limited-liability company, as applicable. Section 13 of this bill makes a
35 conforming change to replace “certificate of dissolution” with “record of dissolution.” Section
36 16 of this bill provides an effective date and time for filing the articles of dissolution of a
37 limited-liability company.
38 Sections 14 and 17 of this bill provide for either the residence or business address of
39 members and managers of a limited-liability company to be listed for certain records.
40 Section 22 of this bill establishes a new process by which a corporation may: (1)
41 reorganize through the formation of a holding corporation; and (2) issue stockholders shares
42 in the new holding corporation in exchange for their previous shares. Section 23 of this bill:
43 (1) revises the steps required for a board of directors to approve a plan of merger, conversion
44 or exchange; and (2) removes provisions of existing law which allowed for the board to cancel
45 a proposed meeting to consider or remove a plan of merger, conversion or exchange. Section
46 24 of this bill makes a conforming change relating to voting for purposes of the new process
47 of reorganization into a holding corporation.
48 Section 25 of this bill makes a technical change relating to one domestic entity
49 converting into one foreign entity.
50 Section 26 of this bill provides that the right to dissent is the exclusive remedy for
51 stockholders who have the ability to dissent from a particular corporate action.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 75.150 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 75.150 1. Except as otherwise provided by specific statute:
3 (a) Any notice or other communication described in this title may be given or
4 sent by any method of delivery [;] and each agreement, instrument, certificate or
5 other document enclosed with, or annexed or appended to, such notice or other
6 communication shall be deemed part of the notice or communication solely for
7 purposes of determining whether notice was duly given under this title and the
8 organic rules of the entity giving or sending the notice or other communication;
9 and
10 (b) An electronic transmission must be in accordance with this section.

Assembly Amendment No. 289 to Assembly Bill No. 239 Page 5
1 2. A notice or other communication given or sent pursuant to the organic law
2 or organic rules of an entity may be delivered by electronic transmission if:
3 (a) Consented to by the recipient or authorized by subsection 9; and
4 (b) The electronic transmission contains or is accompanied by information
5 from which the recipient can determine the date of the transmission.
6 3. Any consent under subsection 2 may be revoked by the person who
7 consented by written or electronic notice to the person to whom the consent was
8 delivered. Any such consent is deemed revoked if:
9 (a) The person is unable to receive two consecutive electronic transmissions
10 given by the entity or organization in accordance with such consent; and
11 (b) Such inability becomes known to the secretary of the entity sending the
12 electronic transmissions or to the transfer agent or other person responsible for the
13 giving of notice or other communications.
14  The inadvertent failure to treat any such inability as a revocation does not
15 invalidate any meeting or other action.
16 4. Unless otherwise agreed between sender and recipient, an electronic
17 transmission is received when:
18 (a) It enters an information processing system that the recipient has designated
19 or uses for the purpose of receiving electronic transmissions or information of the
20 type sent; and
21 (b) It is in a form ordinarily capable of being processed by that system.
22 5. Receipt of an electronic acknowledgment from an information processing
23 system described in paragraph (a) of subsection 4 establishes that an electronic
24 transmission was received but, by itself, does not establish that the content sent
25 corresponds to the content received.
26 6. An electronic transmission is received under this section even if no natural
27 person is aware of its receipt.
28 7. Except as otherwise provided by specific statute, any notice or other
29 communication, if in a comprehensible form or manner, is effective at the earliest
30 of the following:
31 (a) If in a physical form, when it is left at:
32 (1) The address of a stockholder, member, partner or other owner of an
33 entity, whichever is applicable, as it appears upon the records of the entity;
34 (2) The residence or usual place of business of a director, manager or
35 general partner, whichever is applicable;
36 (3) The entity’s principal place of business; or
37 (4) If to a recipient other than a stockholder, director, member, partner or
38 other owner of an entity or an entity, such person’s residence or usual place of
39 business;
40 (b) If mailed by United States mail postage prepaid and correctly addressed to
41 a stockholder, member, partner or other owner of an entity, upon deposit in the
42 United States mail;
43 (c) If mailed by United States mail postage prepaid and correctly addressed to
44 a recipient other than a stockholder, member, partner or other owner of an entity,
45 the earliest of:
46 (1) If sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, the date
47 shown on the return receipt signed by or on behalf of the addressee; or
48 (2) Five days after it is deposited in the United States mail;
49 (d) If an electronic transmission, when it is received as provided in subsection
50 4; and
51 (e) If oral, when communicated.

Assembly Amendment No. 289 to Assembly Bill No. 239 Page 6
1  In the absence of fraud, an affidavit of the secretary of the entity or the transfer
2 agent or any other agent of the entity that the notice has been given by a form of
3 electronic transmission is prima facie evidence of the facts stated in the affidavit.
4 8. A notice or other communication may be in the form of an electronic
5 transmission that cannot be directly reproduced in paper form by the recipient
6 through an automated process used in conventional commercial practice only if:
7 (a) The electronic transmission is otherwise retrievable in perceivable form;
8 and
9 (b) The sender and the recipient have consented in writing to the use of such
10 form of electronic transmission.
11 9. If any provision of this title prescribes requirements for notices or other
12 communication in particular circumstances, those requirements govern. If the
13 organic rules of an entity prescribe requirements for notices or other
14 communications, not inconsistent with this section or other provisions of this title,
15 those requirements govern. The organic rules of an entity may authorize, require or
16 prohibit delivery of notices of meetings of directors, managers, members, partners
17 or other owners of the entity by electronic transmission.
18 10. In the event that any provisions of this section are deemed to modify, limit
19 or supersede the federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce
20 Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 7001 et seq., the provisions of this section shall be deemed to
21 control to the maximum extent permitted by section 102(a)(2) of that Act, 15
22 U.S.C. § 7002(a)(2).
23 11. As used in this section:
24 (a) “Entity” has the meaning ascribed to it in NRS 77.060.
25 (b) “Organic law” has the meaning ascribed to it in NRS 77.170.
26 (c) “Organic rules” has the meaning ascribed to it in NRS 77.180.
27 Sec. 1.5. NRS 78.046 is hereby amended to read as follows:
28 78.046 1. The articles of incorporation or bylaws of a corporation may
29 require, to the extent not inconsistent with any applicable jurisdictional
30 requirements and the laws of the United States, that any, all or certain:
31 (a) Concurrent jurisdiction actions must be brought solely or exclusively in the
32 court or courts specified in the requirement; and
33 (b) Internal actions must be brought solely or exclusively in the court or courts
34 specified in the requirement, which must include at least one court in this State.
35 2. Unless otherwise expressly set forth in the articles of incorporation or
36 bylaws, any requirement described in subsection 1 must not be interpreted as
37 prohibiting any corporation from consenting, or requiring any corporation to
38 consent, to any alternative forum in any instance.
39 3. The provisions of this section do not create or authorize any cause of action
40 against a corporation , [or] its directors or officers [.] or any controlling
41 stockholder.
42 4. The articles of incorporation of a corporation may require, to the extent
43 not inconsistent with any applicable laws of the United States, that any, all or
44 certain internal actions to be tried in any court of this State must be tried before
45 the presiding judge as the trier of fact and not before a jury. Upon and during its
46 effectiveness, any such requirement must conclusively operate as a waiver of the
47 right to trial by jury by each party to any internal action to which such
48 requirement applies. Nothing in this section or any such requirement shall be
49 construed as to limit or otherwise affect any right to a jury trial in any action, suit
50 or proceeding that is not an internal action.
51 5. As used in this section:
52 (a) “Concurrent jurisdiction action” means any action, suit or proceeding
53 against the corporation or any of its directors or officers, that:

2 (2) Could be properly commenced in either a federal forum or a forum of
3 this State or any other state; and
4 (3) Is brought by or in the name or on behalf of:
5 (I) The corporation;
6 (II) Any stockholder of the corporation; or
7 (III) Any subscriber for, or purchaser or offeree of, any shares or other
8 securities of the corporation.
9 (b) “Controlling stockholder” has the meaning ascribed to it in NRS 78.240.
10 (c) “Court” means any court of:
11 (1) This State, including, without limitation, those courts in any county
12 having a business court, as that term is defined in NRS 13.050;
13 (2) A state other than this State; or
14 (3) The United States.
15 [(c)] (d) “Internal action” means any action, suit or proceeding:
16 (1) Brought in the name or right of the corporation or on its behalf,
17 including, without limitation, any action subject to NRS 41.520;
18 (2) For or based upon any breach of any fiduciary duty owed by any
19 director, officer [, employee] or [agent] controlling stockholder of the corporation
20 in such capacity; or
21 (3) Arising pursuant to, or to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the
22 validity of, any provision of this title, the articles of incorporation, the bylaws or
23 any agreement entered into pursuant to NRS 78.365 to which the corporation is a
24 party or a stated beneficiary thereof.
25 Sec. 2. NRS 78.138 is hereby amended to read as follows:

34 believed to be reliable and competent in the matters prepared or presented;
35 (b) Counsel, public accountants, financial advisers, valuation advisers,

39 serve, established in accordance with NRS 78.125, as to matters within the
40 committee’s designated authority and matters on which the committee is reasonably
41 believed to merit confidence,
42  but a director or officer is not entitled to rely on such information, opinions,
43 reports, books of account or statements if the director or officer has knowledge
44 concerning the matter in question that would cause reliance thereon to be
45 unwarranted.
46 3. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 1 of NRS 78.139, directors and
47 officers, in deciding upon matters of business, are presumed to act in good faith, on
48 an informed basis and with a view to the interests of the corporation. A director or

12 independence of the corporation.
13 (b) Consider or assign weight to the interests of any particular person or group,
14 or to any other relevant facts, circumstances, contingencies or constituencies.
15 5. Directors and officers are not required to consider, as a dominant factor, the
16 effect of a proposed corporate action upon any particular group or constituency
17 having an interest in the corporation.
18 6. The provisions of subsections 4 and 5 do not create or authorize any causes
19 of action against the corporation or its directors or officers.
20 7. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 35.230, 90.660, 91.250, 452.200,

37 corporation that desires to decrease the number of issued and outstanding shares of
38 a class or series held by each stockholder of record at the effective date and time of
39 the change without correspondingly decreasing the number of authorized shares of
40 the same class or series may do so if:
41 (a) The board of directors adopts a resolution setting forth the proposal to
42 decrease the number of issued and outstanding shares of a class or series; and
43 (b) If the corporation is:
44 (1) A publicly traded corporation, the proposal is approved by the
45 stockholders of the affected class or series, regardless of limitations or restrictions
46 on the voting power of the affected class or series; or
47 (2) Not a publicly traded corporation, the proposal is approved by the vote
48 of stockholders holding a majority of the voting power of the affected class or
49 series,
50  or such greater proportion as may be provided in the articles of incorporation,
51 regardless of limitations or restrictions on the voting power of the affected class or
52 series.

Assembly Amendment No. 289 to Assembly Bill No. 239 Page 9
1 2. If the proposal required by subsection 1 is approved by the stockholders
2 entitled to vote, the corporation may reissue its stock in accordance with the
3 proposal after the effective date and time of the change.
4 3. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection [,] and unless the articles
5 of incorporation require a greater proportion, if a proposed decrease in the
6 number of issued and outstanding shares of any class or series would adversely
7 alter or change any preference, or any relative or other right given to any other class
8 or series of outstanding shares, then the decrease must be approved , [by the vote,]
9 in addition to any vote otherwise required [, of] :
10 (a) If the corporation is a publicly traded corporation, by the vote of the
11 stockholders of each class or series whose preference or rights are adversely
12 affected by the decrease; or

14 shares representing a majority of the voting power of each class or series whose
15 preference or rights are adversely affected by the decrease,
16  [or such greater proportion as may be provided in the articles of incorporation,]
17 regardless of limitations or restrictions on the voting power of the adversely
18 affected class or series. The decrease does not have to be approved by the vote of
19 the holders of shares representing a majority of the voting power of each class or
20 series whose preference or rights are adversely affected by the decrease if the
21 articles of incorporation specifically deny the right to vote on such a decrease.
22 4. If any proposed corporate action pursuant to this section would result in
23 only money being paid or scrip being issued to stockholders who:
24 (a) Before the decrease in the number of shares becomes effective, in the
25 aggregate hold 1 percent or more of the outstanding shares of the affected class or
26 series; and
27 (b) Would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share in exchange for
28 the cancellation of all their outstanding shares,
29  any stockholder who is obligated, as a result of the corporate action taken
30 pursuant to this section, to accept money or scrip rather than receive a fraction of a
31 share in exchange for the cancellation of all the stockholder’s outstanding shares,
32 may dissent in accordance with the provisions of NRS 92A.300 to 92A.500,
33 inclusive, and obtain payment of the fair value of the fraction of a share to which
34 the stockholder would otherwise be entitled.
35 Sec. 4. NRS 78.207 is hereby amended to read as follows:
36 78.207 1. Unless otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation, a
37 corporation that desires to change the number of shares of a class or series, if any,
38 of its authorized stock by increasing or decreasing the number of authorized shares
39 of the class or series and correspondingly increasing or decreasing the number of
40 issued and outstanding shares of the same class or series held by each stockholder
41 of record at the effective date and time of the change, may, except as otherwise
42 provided in subsections 2 and 3, do so by a resolution adopted by the board of
43 directors, without obtaining the approval of the stockholders. The resolution may
44 also provide for a change of the par value, if any, of the same class or series of the
45 shares increased or decreased. After the effective date and time of the change, the
46 corporation may issue its stock in accordance therewith.
47 2. A proposal to increase or decrease the number of authorized shares of any
48 class or series, if any, that includes provisions pursuant to which only money will
49 be paid or scrip will be issued to stockholders who:

52 class or series; and

Assembly Amendment No. 289 to Assembly Bill No. 239 Page 10

2 the cancellation of all their outstanding shares,

5 in the articles of incorporation, regardless of limitations or restrictions on the voting
6 power thereof.
7 3. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection [,] and unless the articles
8 of incorporation require a greater proportion, if a proposed increase or decrease in
9 the number of authorized shares of any class or series would adversely alter or
10 change any preference or any relative or other right given to any other class or
11 series of outstanding shares, then the increase or decrease must be approved , [by
12 the vote,] in addition to any vote otherwise required [, of] :
13 (a) If the corporation is a publicly traded corporation, by the vote of
14 stockholders of each class or series whose preference or rights are adversely
15 affected by the increase or decrease; and
16 (b) If the corporation is not a publicly traded corporation, by the holders of
17 shares representing a majority of the voting power of each class or series whose
18 preference or rights are adversely affected by the increase or decrease,
19  regardless of limitations or restrictions on the voting power thereof. The increase
20 or decrease does not have to be approved by the vote of the holders of shares
21 [representing a majority of the voting power in each] of any class or series whose
22 preference or rights are adversely affected by the increase or decrease if the articles
23 of incorporation specifically deny the holders of shares of such class or series the
24 right to vote on such an increase or decrease.
25 4. If any proposed corporate action pursuant to this section would result in
26 only money being paid or scrip being issued to stockholders who:
27 (a) Before the increase or decrease in the number of shares becomes effective,
28 in the aggregate hold 1 percent or more of the outstanding shares of the affected
29 class or series; and
30 (b) Would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share in exchange for
31 the cancellation of all of their outstanding shares,
32  any stockholder who is obligated, as a result of the corporate action taken
33 pursuant to this section, to accept money or scrip rather than receive a fraction of a
34 share in exchange for the cancellation of all the stockholder’s outstanding shares,
35 may dissent in accordance with the provisions of NRS 92A.300 to 92A.500,
36 inclusive, and obtain payment of the fair value of the fraction of a share to which
37 the stockholder would otherwise be entitled.
38 Sec. 5. NRS 78.215 is hereby amended to read as follows:
39 78.215 1. A corporation may issue and dispose of its authorized shares for
40 such consideration as may be prescribed in the articles of incorporation or, if no
41 consideration is so prescribed, then for such consideration as may be fixed by the
42 board of directors.
43 2. If a consideration is prescribed for shares without par value, that
44 consideration must not be used to determine the fees required for filing articles of
45 incorporation pursuant to NRS 78.760.
46 3. Unless the articles of incorporation provide otherwise [,] and except as
47 otherwise provided by subsection 4, shares may be issued pro rata and without
48 consideration to the corporation’s stockholders or to the stockholders of one or
49 more classes or series. [An issuance of shares under this subsection is a share
50 dividend.]

7 Sec. 5.5. NRS 78.240 is hereby amended to read as follows:
8 78.240 1. The shares of stock in every corporation shall be personal
9 property and shall be transferable on the books of the corporation, in such manner
10 and under such regulations as may be provided in the articles of incorporation or
11 bylaws, and as provided in this title and chapters 104 to 104C, inclusive, of NRS.
12 2. Except to the extent set forth in subsection 3:
13 (a) The holder of any share of stock in a corporation, regardless of the
14 holder’s relative beneficial ownership of shares or relative voting power, may,
15 and shall be entitled to, exercise or withhold the voting power of such share in the
16 holder’s personal interest and without regard to any other person or interest; and
17 (b) No stockholder of a corporation, in such person’s capacity as a
18 stockholder and regardless of the stockholder’s relative beneficial ownership of
19 share or relative voting power, shall have any fiduciary duty to the corporation or
20 any other stockholder.
21 3. The only fiduciary duty of a controlling stockholder of a corporation, in
22 such person’s capacity as a stockholder, is to refrain from exerting undue
23 influence over any director or officer of the corporation with the purpose and
24 proximate effect of inducing a breach of fiduciary duty by such director or
25 officer:
26 (a) For which breach the director or officer is liable pursuant to NRS
27 78.138; and
28 (b) Which breach:
29 (1) Directly relates to the initiation, evaluation, negotiation,
30 authorization or approval by the board of directors, or a committee thereof, of a
31 contract or transaction to which the controlling stockholder or any of its affiliates
32 or associates is a party or in which the controlling stockholder or any of its
33 affiliates or associates has a material and nonspeculative financial interest; and
34 (2) Results in material, nonspeculative and non-ratable financial benefit
35 to the controlling stockholder, which benefit excludes, and results in a material
36 and nonspeculative detriment to the other stockholders generally.
37  The exercise or withholding of voting power by a controlling stockholder, or
38 the indication or implication by a controlling stockholder as to whether or to
39 what extent such voting power may be exercised or withheld, does not, by itself,
40 constitute or indicate a breach of the fiduciary duty imposed by this subsection.
41 4. A controlling stockholder is presumed to have not breached the fiduciary
42 duty imposed by subsection 3 with respect to a contract or other transaction if
43 such contract or transaction has been authorized or approved by:
44 (a) A committee of the board of directors consisting of only disinterested
45 directors; or
46 (b) The board of directors in reliance on the recommendation of a committee
47 of the board of directors consisting of only disinterested directors.
48 5. A stockholder of a corporation is not individually liable to the
49 corporation or its stockholders or creditors for any damages as a result of any act
50 or failure to act in such person’s capacity as a stockholder unless:
51 (a) The stockholder is a controlling stockholder;
52 (b) The presumption established by subsection 4 has been rebutted; and

Assembly Amendment No. 289 to Assembly Bill No. 239 Page 12
1 (c) It is proven that the stockholder’s act or failure to act constituted a
2 breach of the stockholder’s fiduciary duty imposed by subsection 3.
3 6. As used in this section:
4 (a) “Affiliate” has the meaning ascribed to it in NRS 78.412.
5 (b) “Associate” has the meaning ascribed to it in NRS 78.413.
6 (c) “Beneficial ownership” means being the beneficial owner of shares. As
7 used in this paragraph, “beneficial owner” has the meaning ascribed to it in NRS
8 78.414.
9 (d) “Controlling stockholder” means a stockholder of a corporation having
10 the voting power, by virtue of such stockholder’s relative beneficial ownership of
11 shares or otherwise pursuant to the articles of incorporation, to elect at least a
12 majority of the corporation’s directors.
13 (e) “Disinterested director,” when used with respect to a contract or
14 transaction, includes, without limitation, a director of a corporation who:
15 (1) Individually, or with or through any of the director’s affiliates or
16 associates other than the corporation, neither has a material and nonspeculative
17 financial interest in, nor is a party to, the contract or transaction; and
18 (2) Would satisfy the independence standards, without regard to any
19 financial literacy of financial expert qualifications, required to serve on an audit
20 committee of a board of directors of a non-investment company issuer pursuant
21 to section 10A(m) of the Securities Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78j-1(m) and Rule
22 10A-3 thereunder, 17 C.F.R. § 240.10A-3 and the rules of the national securities
23 exchange, if any, on which any shares of the corporation’s stock are listed for
24 trading.
25 Sec. 6. NRS 78.315 is hereby amended to read as follows:
26 78.315 1. Unless the articles of incorporation or the bylaws provide for a
27 greater or lesser proportion, a majority of the board of directors of the corporation
28 then in office, at a meeting duly assembled, is necessary to constitute a quorum for
29 the transaction of business, and the act of directors holding a majority of the voting
30 power of the directors, present at a meeting at which a quorum is present, is the act
31 of the board of directors.
32 2. Unless otherwise restricted by the articles of incorporation or bylaws, any
33 action required or permitted to be taken at a meeting of the board of directors or of
34 a committee thereof may be taken without a meeting if, before or after the action, a
35 written consent thereto is signed by all the members of the board or of the
36 committee, except that such written consent is not required to be signed by:
37 (a) A common or interested director who abstains in writing from providing
38 consent to the action. If a common or interested director abstains in writing from
39 providing consent:
40 (1) The fact of the common directorship, office or financial interest must
41 be known to the board of directors or committee before a written consent is signed
42 by all the members of the board of the committee.
43 (2) Such fact must be described in the written consent.
44 (3) The board of directors or committee must approve, authorize or ratify
45 the action in good faith by unanimous consent without counting the abstention of
46 the common or interested director.
47 (b) A director who is a party to an action, suit or proceeding who abstains in
48 writing from providing consent to the action of the board of directors or committee.
49 If a director who is a party to an action, suit or proceeding abstains in writing from
50 providing consent on the basis that he or she is a party to an action, suit or
51 proceeding, the board of directors or committee must:
52 (1) Make a determination pursuant to NRS 78.7502 that indemnification of
53 the director is proper under the circumstances.

Assembly Amendment No. 289 to Assembly Bill No. 239 Page 13
1 (2) Approve, authorize or ratify the action of the board of directors or
2 committee in good faith by unanimous consent without counting the abstention of
3 the director who is a party to an action, suit or proceeding.
4 3. Unless otherwise restricted by the articles of incorporation or bylaws,
5 members of the board of directors or the governing body of any corporation, or of
6 any committee designated by such board or body, may participate in a meeting of
7 the board, body or committee through electronic communications,
8 videoconferencing, teleconferencing or other available technology if the

10 (a) Verify the identity of each person participating through such means as a
11 director or member of the governing body or committee, as the case may be; and
12 (b) Provide the directors or members a reasonable opportunity to participate in
13 the meeting and to vote on matters submitted to the directors or members, as the
14 case may be, including an opportunity to communicate and to read or hear the
15 proceedings of the meeting in a substantially concurrent manner with such
16 proceedings.
17 4. Participation in a meeting pursuant to subsection 3 constitutes presence in
18 person at the meeting.
19 5. Whenever this title expressly requires the board of directors to approve or
20 take other action with respect to any agreement, instrument, certificate or other
21 document, including, without limitation, any agreement, instrument, certificate
22 or other document required to be filed with the Secretary of State, the directors
23 may approve, adopt or otherwise act upon such agreement, instrument, certificate
24 or other document in final form or such preliminary form as the directors deem
25 appropriate in their business judgment.
26 Sec. 7. NRS 78.365 is hereby amended to read as follows:
27 78.365 1. A stockholder, by agreement in writing, may transfer his or her
28 stock to a voting trustee or trustees for the purpose of conferring the right to vote
29 the stock for a period not exceeding 15 years upon the terms and conditions therein
30 stated. Any certificates of stock so transferred must be surrendered and cancelled
31 and new certificates for the stock issued to the trustee or trustees in which it must
32 appear that they are issued pursuant to the agreement, and in the entry of ownership
33 in the proper books of the corporation that fact must also be noted, and thereupon
34 the trustee or trustees may vote the stock so transferred during the terms of the
35 agreement. A duplicate of every such agreement must be filed in the registered
36 office of the corporation and at all times during its terms be open to inspection by
37 any stockholder or his or her attorney.
38 2. At any time within the 2 years next preceding the expiration of an
39 agreement entered into pursuant to the provisions of subsection 1, or the expiration
40 of an extension of that agreement, any beneficiary of the trust may, by written
41 agreement with the trustee or trustees, extend the duration of the trust for a time not
42 to exceed 15 years after the scheduled expiration date of the original agreement or
43 the latest extension. An extension is not effective unless the trustee, before the
44 expiration date of the original agreement or the latest extension, files a duplicate of
45 the agreement providing for the extension in the registered office of the
46 corporation. An agreement providing for an extension does not affect the rights or
47 obligations of any person not a party to that agreement. An agreement entered into
48 pursuant to the provisions of subsection 1 is not invalidated by the fact that, by its
49 terms, its duration is more than 15 years, but its duration shall be deemed amended
50 to conform with the provisions of this section.
51 3. An agreement between two or more stockholders, or between the
52 corporation and one or more stockholders, if in writing and signed by each

Assembly Amendment No. 289 to Assembly Bill No. 239 Page 14
1 [stockholder] party to be bound thereby, may provide that in exercising any voting
2 rights, the stock held by each such stockholder must be voted:
3 (a) Pursuant to the provisions of the agreement;
4 (b) As [they] the parties to the agreement may subsequently agree; [or]
5 (c) In accordance with a procedure [agreed upon.] specified in the agreement;
6 or
7 (d) In a manner dependent upon any fact or event which may be ascertained
8 outside of the agreement if the manner in which a fact or event may operate upon
9 the exercise of the voting rights is stated in the agreement. As used in this
10 paragraph, “fact or event” includes, without limitation, the existence of a fact or
11 an occurrence of an event, including, without limitation, a determination or
12 action by a person, the corporation itself or any government, governmental
13 agency or political subdivision of a government.
14 4. An agreement pursuant to the provisions of subsection 3 is valid and
15 enforceable against the transferee of a stockholder party to the agreement only:
16 (a) If and to the extent that the transferee agrees in writing to be bound by the
17 agreement; or
18 (b) If the agreement expressly provides that it is enforceable against the
19 transferee of a stockholder party to the agreement and:
20 (1) The transferee had actual knowledge of the existence of the agreement
21 before the transfer; or
22 (2) The existence of the agreement is noted conspicuously on the front or
23 back of the stock certificate or is contained in the written statement of information
24 required by subsection 5 of NRS 78.235.
25 5. An agreement pursuant to the provisions of subsection 3, or an amendment
26 thereto or an extension thereof, in each case entered into before October 1, 2021, is
27 not:
28 (a) Effective for a term of more than 15 years, but at any time within the 2
29 years next preceding the expiration of the agreement the parties thereto may extend
30 its duration for such period as is stated in the extension; and
31 (b) Invalidated by the fact that by its terms its duration is more than 15 years,
32 but its duration shall be deemed amended to conform with the provisions of this
33 section.
34 Sec. 8. NRS 78.390 is hereby amended to read as follows:
35 78.390 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 8 or in NRS 77.340 or
36 78.209 or chapter 92A of NRS, every amendment to the articles of incorporation
37 must be made and approved in the following manner:
38 (a) The board of directors must adopt a resolution setting forth the amendment
39 proposed and submit the proposed amendment to the stockholders for approval [.
40 (b) If] and if the corporation is:
41 (1) A publicly traded corporation and the amendment proposed relates
42 solely to an increase or decrease in the number of shares the corporation is
43 authorized to issue, the stockholders of the affected class or series, regardless of
44 limitations or restrictions on the voting power of the affected class or series, must
45 approve the proposed amendment; or
46 (2) Not a publicly traded corporation, or is a publicly traded corporation
47 but the amendment proposed does not relate solely to an increase or decrease in
48 the number of shares the corporation is authorized to issue, the stockholders
49 holding shares in the corporation representing at least a majority of the voting
50 power, or such greater proportion of the voting power as may be required in the
51 case of a vote by classes or series, as provided in subsections 2 and 4, or as may be
52 required by the provisions of the articles of incorporation, [have approved] must
53 approve the proposed amendment.

Assembly Amendment No. 289 to Assembly Bill No. 239 Page 15
1  Upon the approval of the proposed amendment [,] by the stockholders as
2 provided in this subsection, an officer of the corporation shall sign a certificate
3 setting forth the amendment, or setting forth the articles of incorporation as
4 amended, and the vote by which the amendment was adopted.
5 [(c)] (b) The certificate so signed must be filed with the Secretary of State.
6 (c) An amendment adopted pursuant to this subsection that would have the
7 effect of decreasing the number of shares of a class or series of shares the
8 corporation is authorized to issue below the number of shares of such class or
9 series then issued and outstanding shall be void and of no effect.
10 2. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, if any proposed
11 amendment would adversely alter or change any preference or any relative or other
12 right given to any class or series of outstanding shares, then, in addition to any
13 approval otherwise required, the amendment must be approved by the holders of
14 shares representing a majority of the voting power of each class or series adversely
15 affected by the amendment regardless of limitations or restrictions on the voting
16 power thereof. The amendment does not have to be approved by the holders of
17 shares [representing a majority of the voting power] of [each] any class or series
18 whose preference or rights are adversely affected by the amendment if the articles
19 of incorporation specifically deny the holders of such class or series the right to
20 vote on such an amendment. Except as otherwise provided in the articles of
21 incorporation, a proposed amendment that designates one or more new series of
22 an existing class as having any preference or any relative or other right that has
23 higher or equal seniority to the corresponding preference or relative or other
24 right of an existing series of the same class does not, solely by virtue of the higher
25 or equal seniority of the preference or right of the proposed new series, constitute
26 an amendment that would adversely alter or change the preference or rights of
27 the existing series.
28 3. Provision may be made in the articles of incorporation requiring, in the
29 case of any specified amendments, approval by a larger proportion of the voting
30 power of stockholders than that required by this section.
31 4. Different series of the same class of shares do not constitute different
32 classes of shares for the purpose of voting by classes except when the series is
33 adversely affected by an amendment in a different manner than other series of the
34 same class.
35 5. The board of directors may, by resolution, abandon the proposed
36 amendment without further action by the stockholders if the resolution of the
37 stockholders approving the proposed amendment authorizes the board of directors
38 to do so. The board of directors may, by resolution, abandon a proposed
39 amendment pursuant to subsection 8 without any action by the stockholders.
40 6. A certificate filed pursuant to subsection 1 is effective at the time of the
41 filing of the certificate with the Secretary of State or upon a later date and time as
42 specified in the certificate, which date must not be more than 90 days after the date
43 on which the certificate is filed. If a certificate filed pursuant to subsection 1
44 specifies a later effective date but does not specify an effective time, the certificate
45 is effective at 12:01 a.m. in the Pacific time zone on the specified later date.
46 7. If a certificate filed pursuant to subsection 1 specifies a later effective date
47 or time and if the board of directors is authorized to abandon the proposed
48 amendment pursuant to subsection 5, the board of directors may terminate the
49 effectiveness of the certificate by resolution and by filing a certificate of
50 termination with the Secretary of State that:
51 (a) Is filed before the effective time of the certificate filed with the Secretary of
52 State pursuant to subsection 1;
53 (b) Identifies the certificate being terminated;

Assembly Amendment No. 289 to Assembly Bill No. 239 Page 16
1 (c) States that the board of directors is authorized to terminate the effectiveness
2 of the certificate;
3 (d) States that the effectiveness of the certificate has been terminated;
4 (e) Is signed by an officer of the corporation; and
5 (f) Is accompanied by a filing fee of $175.
6 8. No action by the stockholders is required if the proposed amendment to the
7 articles of incorporation consists only of a change in the name of the corporation.
8 The articles of incorporation may forbid a corporation from amending the articles
9 of incorporation pursuant to this subsection without stockholder approval.
