Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth various provisions governing business entities, including
2 private corporations and limited-liability companies. (Chapters 78 and 86 of NRS)
3 This bill makes various changes to business entities.
4 Section 1 of this bill clarifies that the inclusion of certain materials provided
5 with a notice or other communication by a business entity are deemed to be part of
6 the notice or communication. Section 1.5 of this bill authorizes the articles of
7 incorporation of a corporation to require certain internal actions to be tried before a
8 judge and not a jury. Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change relating to
9 the fiduciary duties of directors and officers of a private corporation for consistency
10 within existing law.
11 Sections 3 and 4 of this bill require that votes relating to the approval of a
12 reverse stock split be approved by the vote of the relevant stockholders of such a
13 class or series of stock. Sections 5 and 9 of this bill remove the phrase “share
14 dividend” from provisions governing the issuance of shares of a private
15 corporation. Section 5.5 of this bill sets forth provisions relating to the fiduciary
16 duties of certain stockholders of a corporation, limits the individual liability of a
17 stockholder of a corporation under certain circumstances and defines certain terms
18 for such purposes.
19 Section 6 of this bill authorizes a board of directors of a private corporation to
20 take certain actions in final form or such preliminary form as the directors deem
21 appropriate in their business judgment.
22 Section 7 of this bill: (1) provides that voting agreements entered into by
23 stockholders may include a private corporation; and (2) makes conforming changes
24 authorizing the reference in such an agreement to facts or events outside of the
25 agreement as provided in existing law. Section 8 of this bill: (1) provides that a
26 proposed amendment to the articles of incorporation of a private corporation after
27 the issuance of stock that designates one or more new series of an existing class
28 does not adversely alter or change the preferences or rights of the existing series;
29 and (2) authorizes a publicly traded corporation to amend its articles of
30 incorporation to increase or decrease the shares it is authorized to issue through a
31 stockholder vote.
32 Section 11 of this bill clarifies the notice required if the approval of a
33 dissolution of a corporation was obtained by written consent and replaces the
34 phrase “certificate of dissolution” with “articles of dissolution” for purposes of
35 provisions relating to the dissolution of a corporation. Sections 10-12, 15 and 18-
36 21 of this bill make conforming changes to reference “articles of dissolution” for
37 purposes of provisions relating to the dissolution of a corporation or a limited-
38 liability company, as applicable. Section 13 of this bill makes a conforming change
39 to replace “certificate of dissolution” with “record of dissolution.” Section 16 of
40 this bill provides an effective date and time for filing the articles of dissolution of a
41 limited-liability company.
42 Sections 14 and 17 of this bill provide for either the residence or business
43 address of members and managers of a limited-liability company to be listed for
44 certain records.
45 Section 22 of this bill establishes a new process by which a corporation may:
46 (1) reorganize through the formation of a holding corporation; and (2) issue
47 stockholders shares in the new holding corporation in exchange for their previous
48 shares. Section 23 of this bill: (1) revises the steps required for a board of directors
49 to approve a plan of merger, conversion or exchange; and (2) removes provisions of
50 existing law which allowed for the board to cancel a proposed meeting to consider
51 or remove a plan of merger, conversion or exchange. Section 24 of this bill makes a
52 conforming change relating to voting for purposes of the new process of
53 reorganization into a holding corporation.

54 Section 25 of this bill makes a technical change relating to one domestic entity
55 converting into one foreign entity.
56 Section 26 of this bill provides that the right to dissent is the exclusive remedy
57 for stockholders who have the ability to dissent from a particular corporate action.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 75.150 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 75.150 1. Except as otherwise provided by specific statute:
3 (a) Any notice or other communication described in this title
4 may be given or sent by any method of delivery [;] and each
5 agreement, instrument, certificate or other document enclosed
6 with, or annexed or appended to, such notice or other
7 communication shall be deemed part of the notice or
8 communication solely for purposes of determining whether notice
9 was duly given under this title and the organic rules of the entity
10 giving or sending the notice or other communication; and
11 (b) An electronic transmission must be in accordance with this
12 section.
13 2. A notice or other communication given or sent pursuant to
14 the organic law or organic rules of an entity may be delivered by
15 electronic transmission if:
16 (a) Consented to by the recipient or authorized by subsection 9;
17 and
18 (b) The electronic transmission contains or is accompanied by
19 information from which the recipient can determine the date of the
20 transmission.
21 3. Any consent under subsection 2 may be revoked by the
22 person who consented by written or electronic notice to the person
23 to whom the consent was delivered. Any such consent is deemed
24 revoked if:
25 (a) The person is unable to receive two consecutive electronic
26 transmissions given by the entity or organization in accordance with
27 such consent; and
28 (b) Such inability becomes known to the secretary of the entity
29 sending the electronic transmissions or to the transfer agent or other
30 person responsible for the giving of notice or other communications.
31  The inadvertent failure to treat any such inability as a revocation
32 does not invalidate any meeting or other action.
33 4. Unless otherwise agreed between sender and recipient, an
34 electronic transmission is received when:
35 (a) It enters an information processing system that the recipient
36 has designated or uses for the purpose of receiving electronic
37 transmissions or information of the type sent; and
-
*AB239_R1*
– 4 –
1 (b) It is in a form ordinarily capable of being processed by that
2 system.
3 5. Receipt of an electronic acknowledgment from an
4 information processing system described in paragraph (a) of
5 subsection 4 establishes that an electronic transmission was received
6 but, by itself, does not establish that the content sent corresponds to
7 the content received.
8 6. An electronic transmission is received under this section
9 even if no natural person is aware of its receipt.
10 7. Except as otherwise provided by specific statute, any notice
11 or other communication, if in a comprehensible form or manner, is
12 effective at the earliest of the following:
13 (a) If in a physical form, when it is left at:
14 (1) The address of a stockholder, member, partner or other
15 owner of an entity, whichever is applicable, as it appears upon the
16 records of the entity;
17 (2) The residence or usual place of business of a director,
18 manager or general partner, whichever is applicable;
19 (3) The entity’s principal place of business; or
20 (4) If to a recipient other than a stockholder, director,
21 member, partner or other owner of an entity or an entity, such
22 person’s residence or usual place of business;
23 (b) If mailed by United States mail postage prepaid and
24 correctly addressed to a stockholder, member, partner or other
25 owner of an entity, upon deposit in the United States mail;
26 (c) If mailed by United States mail postage prepaid and correctly
27 addressed to a recipient other than a stockholder, member, partner or
28 other owner of an entity, the earliest of:
29 (1) If sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt
30 requested, the date shown on the return receipt signed by or on
31 behalf of the addressee; or
32 (2) Five days after it is deposited in the United States mail;
33 (d) If an electronic transmission, when it is received as provided
34 in subsection 4; and
35 (e) If oral, when communicated.
36  In the absence of fraud, an affidavit of the secretary of the entity
37 or the transfer agent or any other agent of the entity that the notice
38 has been given by a form of electronic transmission is prima facie
39 evidence of the facts stated in the affidavit.
40 8. A notice or other communication may be in the form of an
41 electronic transmission that cannot be directly reproduced in paper
42 form by the recipient through an automated process used in
43 conventional commercial practice only if:
44 (a) The electronic transmission is otherwise retrievable in
45 perceivable form; and
-
*AB239_R1*
– 5 –
1 (b) The sender and the recipient have consented in writing to the
2 use of such form of electronic transmission.
3 9. If any provision of this title prescribes requirements for
4 notices or other communication in particular circumstances, those
5 requirements govern. If the organic rules of an entity prescribe
6 requirements for notices or other communications, not inconsistent
7 with this section or other provisions of this title, those requirements
8 govern. The organic rules of an entity may authorize, require or
9 prohibit delivery of notices of meetings of directors, managers,
10 members, partners or other owners of the entity by electronic
11 transmission.
12 10. In the event that any provisions of this section are deemed
13 to modify, limit or supersede the federal Electronic Signatures in
14 Global and National Commerce Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 7001 et seq., the
15 provisions of this section shall be deemed to control to the
16 maximum extent permitted by section 102(a)(2) of that Act, 15
17 U.S.C. § 7002(a)(2).
18 11. As used in this section:
19 (a) “Entity” has the meaning ascribed to it in NRS 77.060.
20 (b) “Organic law” has the meaning ascribed to it in NRS 77.170.
21 (c) “Organic rules” has the meaning ascribed to it in
22 NRS 77.180.
23 Sec. 1.5. NRS 78.046 is hereby amended to read as follows:
24 78.046 1. The articles of incorporation or bylaws of a
25 corporation may require, to the extent not inconsistent with any
26 applicable jurisdictional requirements and the laws of the United
27 States, that any, all or certain:
28 (a) Concurrent jurisdiction actions must be brought solely or
29 exclusively in the court or courts specified in the requirement; and
30 (b) Internal actions must be brought solely or exclusively in the
31 court or courts specified in the requirement, which must include at
32 least one court in this State.
33 2. Unless otherwise expressly set forth in the articles of
34 incorporation or bylaws, any requirement described in subsection 1
35 must not be interpreted as prohibiting any corporation from
36 consenting, or requiring any corporation to consent, to any
37 alternative forum in any instance.
38 3. The provisions of this section do not create or authorize any
39 cause of action against a corporation , [or] its directors or officers [.]
40 or any controlling stockholder.
41 4. The articles of incorporation of a corporation may require,
42 to the extent not inconsistent with any applicable laws of the
43 United States, that any, all or certain internal actions to be tried in
44 any court of this State must be tried before the presiding judge as
45 the trier of fact and not before a jury. Upon and during its
-
*AB239_R1*
– 6 –
1 effectiveness, any such requirement must conclusively operate as a
2 waiver of the right to trial by jury by each party to any internal
3 action to which such requirement applies. Nothing in this section
4 or any such requirement shall be construed as to limit or
5 otherwise affect any right to a jury trial in any action, suit or
6 proceeding that is not an internal action.
7 5. As used in this section:
8 (a) “Concurrent jurisdiction action” means any action, suit or

17 (II) Any stockholder of the corporation; or
18 (III) Any subscriber for, or purchaser or offeree of, any

23 (1) This State, including, without limitation, those courts in
24 any county having a business court, as that term is defined in

26 (2) A state other than this State; or
27 (3) The United States.
28 [(c)] (d) “Internal action” means any action, suit or proceeding:
29 (1) Brought in the name or right of the corporation or on its
30 behalf, including, without limitation, any action subject to
31 NRS 41.520;
32 (2) For or based upon any breach of any fiduciary duty owed

36 determine the validity of, any provision of this title, the articles of

38 NRS 78.365 to which the corporation is a party or a stated
39 beneficiary thereof.
40 Sec. 2. NRS 78.138 is hereby amended to read as follows:

11 does not serve, established in accordance with NRS 78.125, as to
12 matters within the committee’s designated authority and matters on
13 which the committee is reasonably believed to merit confidence,
14  but a director or officer is not entitled to rely on such

3 6. The provisions of subsections 4 and 5 do not create or

27 issued and outstanding shares of a class or series held by each
28 stockholder of record at the effective date and time of the change
29 without correspondingly decreasing the number of authorized shares
30 of the same class or series may do so if:

6 unless the articles of incorporation require a greater proportion, if
7 a proposed decrease in the number of issued and outstanding shares
8 of any class or series would adversely alter or change any
9 preference, or any relative or other right given to any other class or
10 series of outstanding shares, then the decrease must be approved ,
11 [by the vote,] in addition to any vote otherwise required [, of] :
12 (a) If the corporation is a publicly traded corporation, by the

18 affected by the decrease,
19  [or such greater proportion as may be provided in the articles of
20 incorporation,] regardless of limitations or restrictions on the voting
21 power of the adversely affected class or series. The decrease does
22 not have to be approved by the vote of the holders of shares
23 representing a majority of the voting power of each class or series
24 whose preference or rights are adversely affected by the decrease if
25 the articles of incorporation specifically deny the right to vote on
26 such a decrease.
27 4. If any proposed corporate action pursuant to this section
28 would result in only money being paid or scrip being issued to
29 stockholders who:
30 (a) Before the decrease in the number of shares becomes
31 effective, in the aggregate hold 1 percent or more of the outstanding
32 shares of the affected class or series; and

39 with the provisions of NRS 92A.300 to 92A.500, inclusive, and
40 obtain payment of the fair value of the fraction of a share to which
41 the stockholder would otherwise be entitled.
42 Sec. 4. NRS 78.207 is hereby amended to read as follows:
43 78.207 1. Unless otherwise provided in the articles of
44 incorporation, a corporation that desires to change the number of

3 number of issued and outstanding shares of the same class or series
4 held by each stockholder of record at the effective date and time of
5 the change, may, except as otherwise provided in subsections 2 and

26 unless the articles of incorporation require a greater proportion, if
27 a proposed increase or decrease in the number of authorized shares
28 of any class or series would adversely alter or change any preference
29 or any relative or other right given to any other class or series of
30 outstanding shares, then the increase or decrease must be approved ,

41 the vote of the holders of shares [representing a majority of the
42 voting power in each] of any class or series whose preference or
43 rights are adversely affected by the increase or decrease if the

16 obtain payment of the fair value of the fraction of a share to which

36 series to be issued approve the issue; or
37 (c) There are no outstanding shares of the class or series to be
38 issued.
39 5. If the board of directors does not fix the record date for
40 determining stockholders entitled to [a share dividend,] shares
41 issued pursuant to subsection 3, it is the date the board of directors
42 authorizes the [share dividend.] issuance.
43 Sec. 5.5. NRS 78.240 is hereby amended to read as follows:
44 78.240 1. The shares of stock in every corporation shall be
45 personal property and shall be transferable on the books of the
-
*AB239_R1*
– 12 –
1 corporation, in such manner and under such regulations as may be
2 provided in the articles of incorporation or bylaws, and as provided
3 in this title and chapters 104 to 104C, inclusive, of NRS.
4 2. Except to the extent set forth in subsection 3:
5 (a) The holder of any share of stock in a corporation,
6 regardless of the holder’s relative beneficial ownership of shares
7 or relative voting power, may, and shall be entitled to, exercise or
8 withhold the voting power of such share in the holder’s personal
9 interest and without regard to any other person or interest; and
10 (b) No stockholder of a corporation, in such person’s capacity
11 as a stockholder and regardless of the stockholder’s relative
12 beneficial ownership of share or relative voting power, shall have
13 any fiduciary duty to the corporation or any other stockholder.
14 3. The only fiduciary duty of a controlling stockholder of a
15 corporation, in such person’s capacity as a stockholder, is to
16 refrain from exerting undue influence over any director or officer
17 of the corporation with the purpose and proximate effect of
18 inducing a breach of fiduciary duty by such director or officer:
19 (a) For which breach the director or officer is liable pursuant
20 to NRS 78.138; and
21 (b) Which breach:
22 (1) Directly relates to the initiation, evaluation, negotiation,
23 authorization or approval by the board of directors, or a committee
24 thereof, of a contract or transaction to which the controlling
25 stockholder or any of its affiliates or associates is a party or in
26 which the controlling stockholder or any of its affiliates or
27 associates has a material and nonspeculative financial interest;
28 and
29 (2) Results in material, nonspeculative and non-ratable
30 financial benefit to the controlling stockholder, which benefit
31 excludes, and results in a material and nonspeculative detriment
32 to the other stockholders generally.
33  The exercise or withholding of voting power by a controlling
34 stockholder, or the indication or implication by a controlling
35 stockholder as to whether or to what extent such voting power may
36 be exercised or withheld, does not, by itself, constitute or indicate a
37 breach of the fiduciary duty imposed by this subsection.
38 4. A controlling stockholder is presumed to have not
39 breached the fiduciary duty imposed by subsection 3 with respect
40 to a contract or other transaction if such contract or transaction
41 has been authorized or approved by:
42 (a) A committee of the board of directors consisting of only
43 disinterested directors; or

2 of a committee of the board of directors consisting of only
3 disinterested directors.
4 5. A stockholder of a corporation is not individually liable to
5 the corporation or its stockholders or creditors for any damages as
6 a result of any act or failure to act in such person’s capacity as a
7 stockholder unless:
8 (a) The stockholder is a controlling stockholder;
9 (b) The presumption established by subsection 4 has been
10 rebutted; and
11 (c) It is proven that the stockholder’s act or failure to act
12 constituted a breach of the stockholder’s fiduciary duty imposed
13 by subsection 3.
14 6. As used in this section:
15 (a) “Affiliate” has the meaning ascribed to it in NRS 78.412.
16 (b) “Associate” has the meaning ascribed to it in NRS 78.413.
17 (c) “Beneficial ownership” means being the beneficial owner
18 of shares. As used in this paragraph, “beneficial owner” has the
19 meaning ascribed to it in NRS 78.414.
20 (d) “Controlling stockholder” means a stockholder of a
21 corporation having the voting power, by virtue of such
22 stockholder’s relative beneficial ownership of shares or otherwise
23 pursuant to the articles of incorporation, to elect at least a
24 majority of the corporation’s directors.
25 (e) “Disinterested director,” when used with respect to a
26 contract or transaction, includes, without limitation, a director of
27 a corporation who:
28 (1) Individually, or with or through any of the director’s
29 affiliates or associates other than the corporation, neither has a
30 material and nonspeculative financial interest in, nor is a party to,
31 the contract or transaction; and
32 (2) Would satisfy the independence standards, without
33 regard to any financial literacy of financial expert qualifications,

38 securities exchange, if any, on which any shares of the
39 corporation’s stock are listed for trading.
40 Sec. 6. NRS 78.315 is hereby amended to read as follows:
41 78.315 1. Unless the articles of incorporation or the bylaws
42 provide for a greater or lesser proportion, a majority of the board of
43 directors of the corporation then in office, at a meeting duly
44 assembled, is necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of
45 business, and the act of directors holding a majority of the voting
-
*AB239_R1*
– 14 –
1 power of the directors, present at a meeting at which a quorum is
2 present, is the act of the board of directors.

26 on the basis that he or she is a party to an action, suit or proceeding,
27 the board of directors or committee must:
28 (1) Make a determination pursuant to NRS 78.7502 that
29 indemnification of the director is proper under the circumstances.
30 (2) Approve, authorize or ratify the action of the board of
31 directors or committee in good faith by unanimous consent without

35 or bylaws, members of the board of directors or the governing body
36 of any corporation, or of any committee designated by such board or

11 directors may approve, adopt or otherwise act upon such
12 agreement, instrument, certificate or other document in final form
13 or such preliminary form as the directors deem appropriate in
14 their business judgment.
15 Sec. 7. NRS 78.365 is hereby amended to read as follows:
16 78.365 1. A stockholder, by agreement in writing, may
17 transfer his or her stock to a voting trustee or trustees for the
18 purpose of conferring the right to vote the stock for a period not
19 exceeding 15 years upon the terms and conditions therein stated.
20 Any certificates of stock so transferred must be surrendered and
21 cancelled and new certificates for the stock issued to the trustee or
22 trustees in which it must appear that they are issued pursuant to the
23 agreement, and in the entry of ownership in the proper books of the
24 corporation that fact must also be noted, and thereupon the trustee or
25 trustees may vote the stock so transferred during the terms of the

33 trustee or trustees, extend the duration of the trust for a time not to

36 unless the trustee, before the expiration date of the original
37 agreement or the latest extension, files a duplicate of the agreement
38 providing for the extension in the registered office of the
39 corporation. An agreement providing for an extension does not
40 affect the rights or obligations of any person not a party to that
41 agreement. An agreement entered into pursuant to the provisions of
42 subsection 1 is not invalidated by the fact that, by its terms, its
43 duration is more than 15 years, but its duration shall be deemed
44 amended to conform with the provisions of this section.

*AB239_R1*
– 16 –
1 3. An agreement between two or more stockholders, or
2 between the corporation and one or more stockholders, if in

11 (d) In a manner dependent upon any fact or event which may
12 be ascertained outside of the agreement if the manner in which a

14 stated in the agreement. As used in this paragraph, “fact or event”
15 includes, without limitation, the existence of a fact or an
16 occurrence of an event, including, without limitation, a
17 determination or action by a person, the corporation itself or any
18 government, governmental agency or political subdivision of a
19 government.
20 4. An agreement pursuant to the provisions of subsection 3 is
21 valid and enforceable against the transferee of a stockholder party to
22 the agreement only:
23 (a) If and to the extent that the transferee agrees in writing to be
24 bound by the agreement; or
25 (b) If the agreement expressly provides that it is enforceable
26 against the transferee of a stockholder party to the agreement and:
27 (1) The transferee had actual knowledge of the existence of
28 the agreement before the transfer; or
29 (2) The existence of the agreement is noted conspicuously on
30 the front or back of the stock certificate or is contained in the written

32 5. An agreement pursuant to the provisions of subsection 3, or
33 an amendment thereto or an extension thereof, in each case entered
34 into before October 1, 2021, is not:
35 (a) Effective for a term of more than 15 years, but at any time
36 within the 2 years next preceding the expiration of the agreement the
37 parties thereto may extend its duration for such period as is stated in
38 the extension; and
39 (b) Invalidated by the fact that by its terms its duration is more
40 than 15 years, but its duration shall be deemed amended to conform
41 with the provisions of this section.
42 Sec. 8. NRS 78.390 is hereby amended to read as follows:
43 78.390 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 8 or in
44 NRS 77.340 or 78.209 or chapter 92A of NRS, every amendment to
-
*AB239_R1*
– 17 –
1 the articles of incorporation must be made and approved in the
2 following manner:
3 (a) The board of directors must adopt a resolution setting forth
4 the amendment proposed and submit the proposed amendment to the
5 stockholders for approval [.
6 (b) If] and if the corporation is:
7 (1) A publicly traded corporation and the amendment
8 proposed relates solely to an increase or decrease in the number of
9 shares the corporation is authorized to issue, the stockholders of
10 the affected class or series, regardless of limitations or restrictions
11 on the voting power of the affected class or series, must approve
12 the proposed amendment; or
13 (2) Not a publicly traded corporation, or is a publicly traded
14 corporation but the amendment proposed does not relate solely to
15 an increase or decrease in the number of shares the corporation is
16 authorized to issue, the stockholders holding shares in the
17 corporation representing at least a majority of the voting power, or
18 such greater proportion of the voting power as may be required in
19 the case of a vote by classes or series, as provided in subsections 2
20 and 4, or as may be required by the provisions of the articles of
21 incorporation, [have approved] must approve the proposed
22 amendment.
23  Upon the approval of the proposed amendment [,] by the
24 stockholders as provided in this subsection, an officer of the
25 corporation shall sign a certificate setting forth the amendment, or
26 setting forth the articles of incorporation as amended, and the vote
27 by which the amendment was adopted.
28 [(c)] (b) The certificate so signed must be filed with the
29 Secretary of State.
30 (c) An amendment adopted pursuant to this subsection that
31 would have the effect of decreasing the number of shares of a
32 class or series of shares the corporation is authorized to issue
33 below the number of shares of such class or series then issued and
34 outstanding shall be void and of no effect.
35 2. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, if any
36 proposed amendment would adversely alter or change any
37 preference or any relative or other right given to any class or series
38 of outstanding shares, then, in addition to any approval otherwise
39 required, the amendment must be approved by the holders of shares
40 representing a majority of the voting power of each class or series
41 adversely affected by the amendment regardless of limitations or
42 restrictions on the voting power thereof. The amendment does not
43 have to be approved by the holders of shares [representing a
44 majority of the voting power] of [each] any class or series whose
45 preference or rights are adversely affected by the amendment if the
-
*AB239_R1*
– 18 –
1 articles of incorporation specifically deny the holders of such class
2 or series the right to vote on such an amendment. Except as
3 otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation, a proposed
4 amendment that designates one or more new series of an existing
5 class as having any preference or any relative or other right that
6 has higher or equal seniority to the corresponding preference or
7 relative or other right of an existing series of the same class does
8 not, solely by virtue of the higher or equal seniority of the
9 preference or right of the proposed new series, constitute an
10 amendment that would adversely alter or change the preference or
11 rights of the existing series.
12 3. Provision may be made in the articles of incorporation
13 requiring, in the case of any specified amendments, approval by a
14 larger proportion of the voting power of stockholders than that
15 required by this section.
16 4. Different series of the same class of shares do not constitute
17 different classes of shares for the purpose of voting by classes
18 except when the series is adversely affected by an amendment in a
19 different manner than other series of the same class.
20 5. The board of directors may, by resolution, abandon the
21 proposed amendment without further action by the stockholders if
22 the resolution of the stockholders approving the proposed
23 amendment authorizes the board of directors to do so. The board of
24 directors may, by resolution, abandon a proposed amendment
25 pursuant to subsection 8 without any action by the stockholders.
26 6. A certificate filed pursuant to subsection 1 is effective at the
27 time of the filing of the certificate with the Secretary of State or
28 upon a later date and time as specified in the certificate, which date
29 must not be more than 90 days after the date on which the certificate
30 is filed. If a certificate filed pursuant to subsection 1 specifies a later
31 effective date but does not specify an effective time, the certificate
32 is effective at 12:01 a.m. in the Pacific time zone on the specified
33 later date.
34 7. If a certificate filed pursuant to subsection 1 specifies a later
35 effective date or time and if the board of directors is authorized to
36 abandon the proposed amendment pursuant to subsection 5, the
37 board of directors may terminate the effectiveness of the certificate
38 by resolution and by filing a certificate of termination with the
39 Secretary of State that:
40 (a) Is filed before the effective time of the certificate filed with
41 the Secretary of State pursuant to subsection 1;

2 terminated;
3 (e) Is signed by an officer of the corporation; and
4 (f) Is accompanied by a filing fee of $175.
5 8. No action by the stockholders is required if the proposed
6 amendment to the articles of incorporation consists only of a change
7 in the name of the corporation. The articles of incorporation may
8 forbid a corporation from amending the articles of incorporation
9 pursuant to this subsection without stockholder approval.

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth various provisions governing business entities, including
2 private corporations and limited-liability companies. (Chapters 78 and 86 of NRS)
3 This bill makes various changes to business entities.
4 Section 1 of this bill clarifies that the inclusion of certain materials provided
5 with a notice or other communication by a business entity are deemed to be part of
6 the notice or communication. Section 1.5 of this bill authorizes the articles of
7 incorporation of a corporation to require certain internal actions to be tried before a
8 judge and not a jury. Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change relating to
9 the fiduciary duties of directors and officers of a private corporation for consistency
10 within existing law.
11 Sections 3 and 4 of this bill require that votes relating to the approval of a
12 reverse stock split be approved by the vote of the relevant stockholders of such a
13 class or series of stock. Sections 5 and 9 of this bill remove the phrase “share
14 dividend” from provisions governing the issuance of shares of a private
15 corporation. Section 5.5 of this bill sets forth provisions relating to the fiduciary
16 duties of certain stockholders of a corporation, limits the individual liability of a
17 stockholder of a corporation under certain circumstances and defines certain terms
18 for such purposes.
19 Section 6 of this bill authorizes a board of directors of a private corporation to
20 take certain actions in final form or such preliminary form as the directors deem
21 appropriate in their business judgment.
22 Section 7 of this bill: (1) provides that voting agreements entered into by
23 stockholders may include a private corporation; and (2) makes conforming changes
24 authorizing the reference in such an agreement to facts or events outside of the
25 agreement as provided in existing law. Section 8 of this bill: (1) provides that a
26 proposed amendment to the articles of incorporation of a private corporation after
27 the issuance of stock that designates one or more new series of an existing class
28 does not adversely alter or change the preferences or rights of the existing series;
29 and (2) authorizes a publicly traded corporation to amend its articles of
30 incorporation to increase or decrease the shares it is authorized to issue through a
31 stockholder vote.
32 Section 11 of this bill clarifies the notice required if the approval of a
33 dissolution of a corporation was obtained by written consent and replaces the
34 phrase “certificate of dissolution” with “articles of dissolution” for purposes of
35 provisions relating to the dissolution of a corporation. Sections 10-12, 15 and 18-
36 21 of this bill make conforming changes to reference “articles of dissolution” for
37 purposes of provisions relating to the dissolution of a corporation or a limited-
38 liability company, as applicable. Section 13 of this bill makes a conforming change
39 to replace “certificate of dissolution” with “record of dissolution.” Section 16 of
40 this bill provides an effective date and time for filing the articles of dissolution of a
41 limited-liability company.
42 Sections 14 and 17 of this bill provide for either the residence or business
43 address of members and managers of a limited-liability company to be listed for
44 certain records.
45 Section 22 of this bill establishes a new process by which a corporation may:
46 (1) reorganize through the formation of a holding corporation; and (2) issue
47 stockholders shares in the new holding corporation in exchange for their previous
48 shares. Section 23 of this bill: (1) revises the steps required for a board of directors
49 to approve a plan of merger, conversion or exchange; and (2) removes provisions of
50 existing law which allowed for the board to cancel a proposed meeting to consider
51 or remove a plan of merger, conversion or exchange. Section 24 of this bill makes a
52 conforming change relating to voting for purposes of the new process of
53 reorganization into a holding corporation.

*AB239_R1*

– 3 –
54 Section 25 of this bill makes a technical change relating to one domestic entity
55 converting into one foreign entity.
56 Section 26 of this bill provides that the right to dissent is the exclusive remedy
57 for stockholders who have the ability to dissent from a particular corporate action.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 75.150 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 75.150 1. Except as otherwise provided by specific statute:
3 (a) Any notice or other communication described in this title
4 may be given or sent by any method of delivery [;] and each
5 agreement, instrument, certificate or other document enclosed
6 with, or annexed or appended to, such notice or other
7 communication shall be deemed part of the notice or
8 communication solely for purposes of determining whether notice
9 was duly given under this title and the organic rules of the entity
10 giving or sending the notice or other communication; and
11 (b) An electronic transmission must be in accordance with this
12 section.
13 2. A notice or other communication given or sent pursuant to
14 the organic law or organic rules of an entity may be delivered by
15 electronic transmission if:
16 (a) Consented to by the recipient or authorized by subsection 9;
17 and
18 (b) The electronic transmission contains or is accompanied by
19 information from which the recipient can determine the date of the
20 transmission.
21 3. Any consent under subsection 2 may be revoked by the
22 person who consented by written or electronic notice to the person
23 to whom the consent was delivered. Any such consent is deemed
24 revoked if:
25 (a) The person is unable to receive two consecutive electronic
26 transmissions given by the entity or organization in accordance with
27 such consent; and
28 (b) Such inability becomes known to the secretary of the entity
29 sending the electronic transmissions or to the transfer agent or other
30 person responsible for the giving of notice or other communications.
31  The inadvertent failure to treat any such inability as a revocation
32 does not invalidate any meeting or other action.
33 4. Unless otherwise agreed between sender and recipient, an
34 electronic transmission is received when:
35 (a) It enters an information processing system that the recipient
36 has designated or uses for the purpose of receiving electronic
37 transmissions or information of the type sent; and
-
*AB239_R1*

– 4 –
1 (b) It is in a form ordinarily capable of being processed by that
2 system.
3 5. Receipt of an electronic acknowledgment from an
4 information processing system described in paragraph (a) of
5 subsection 4 establishes that an electronic transmission was received
6 but, by itself, does not establish that the content sent corresponds to
7 the content received.
8 6. An electronic transmission is received under this section
9 even if no natural person is aware of its receipt.
10 7. Except as otherwise provided by specific statute, any notice
11 or other communication, if in a comprehensible form or manner, is
12 effective at the earliest of the following:

39 evidence of the facts stated in the affidavit.
40 8. A notice or other communication may be in the form of an
41 electronic transmission that cannot be directly reproduced in paper

45 the trier of fact and not before a jury. Upon and during its
-
*AB239_R1*

– 6 –
1 effectiveness, any such requirement must conclusively operate as a
2 waiver of the right to trial by jury by each party to any internal
3 action to which such requirement applies. Nothing in this section
4 or any such requirement shall be construed as to limit or
5 otherwise affect any right to a jury trial in any action, suit or
6 proceeding that is not an internal action.

11 does not serve, established in accordance with NRS 78.125, as to
12 matters within the committee’s designated authority and matters on

14  but a director or officer is not entitled to rely on such

25 78.2055 1. Unless otherwise provided in the articles of
26 incorporation, a corporation that desires to decrease the number of
27 issued and outstanding shares of a class or series held by each
28 stockholder of record at the effective date and time of the change
29 without correspondingly decreasing the number of authorized shares

24 that consideration must not be used to determine the fees required
25 for filing articles of incorporation pursuant to NRS 78.760.
26 3. Unless the articles of incorporation provide otherwise [,]
27 and except as otherwise provided by subsection 4, shares may be
28 issued pro rata and without consideration to the corporation’s
29 stockholders or to the stockholders of one or more classes or series.

43 Sec. 5.5. NRS 78.240 is hereby amended to read as follows:
44 78.240 1. The shares of stock in every corporation shall be
45 personal property and shall be transferable on the books of the

9 interest and without regard to any other person or interest; and
10 (b) No stockholder of a corporation, in such person’s capacity
11 as a stockholder and regardless of the stockholder’s relative
12 beneficial ownership of share or relative voting power, shall have
13 any fiduciary duty to the corporation or any other stockholder.
14 3. The only fiduciary duty of a controlling stockholder of a
15 corporation, in such person’s capacity as a stockholder, is to
16 refrain from exerting undue influence over any director or officer

30 financial benefit to the controlling stockholder, which benefit
31 excludes, and results in a material and nonspeculative detriment
32 to the other stockholders generally.
33  The exercise or withholding of voting power by a controlling
34 stockholder, or the indication or implication by a controlling
35 stockholder as to whether or to what extent such voting power may
36 be exercised or withheld, does not, by itself, constitute or indicate a
37 breach of the fiduciary duty imposed by this subsection.
38 4. A controlling stockholder is presumed to have not
39 breached the fiduciary duty imposed by subsection 3 with respect
40 to a contract or other transaction if such contract or transaction

12 constituted a breach of the stockholder’s fiduciary duty imposed
13 by subsection 3.

18 of shares. As used in this paragraph, “beneficial owner” has the
19 meaning ascribed to it in NRS 78.414.
20 (d) “Controlling stockholder” means a stockholder of a
21 corporation having the voting power, by virtue of such
22 stockholder’s relative beneficial ownership of shares or otherwise
23 pursuant to the articles of incorporation, to elect at least a
24 majority of the corporation’s directors.
25 (e) “Disinterested director,” when used with respect to a
26 contract or transaction, includes, without limitation, a director of
27 a corporation who:
28 (1) Individually, or with or through any of the director’s
29 affiliates or associates other than the corporation, neither has a
30 material and nonspeculative financial interest in, nor is a party to,

45 business, and the act of directors holding a majority of the voting
-
*AB239_R1*

– 14 –
1 power of the directors, present at a meeting at which a quorum is
2 present, is the act of the board of directors.

19 exceeding 15 years upon the terms and conditions therein stated.
20 Any certificates of stock so transferred must be surrendered and
21 cancelled and new certificates for the stock issued to the trustee or
22 trustees in which it must appear that they are issued pursuant to the
23 agreement, and in the entry of ownership in the proper books of the
24 corporation that fact must also be noted, and thereupon the trustee or
25 trustees may vote the stock so transferred during the terms of the
26 agreement. A duplicate of every such agreement must be filed in the
27 registered office of the corporation and at all times during its terms
28 be open to inspection by any stockholder or his or her attorney.

32 any beneficiary of the trust may, by written agreement with the
33 trustee or trustees, extend the duration of the trust for a time not to

2 following manner:
3 (a) The board of directors must adopt a resolution setting forth
4 the amendment proposed and submit the proposed amendment to the
5 stockholders for approval [.
6 (b) If] and if the corporation is:

8 proposed relates solely to an increase or decrease in the number of
9 shares the corporation is authorized to issue, the stockholders of

18 such greater proportion of the voting power as may be required in

27 by which the amendment was adopted.
28 [(c)] (b) The certificate so signed must be filed with the

35 2. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, if any
36 proposed amendment would adversely alter or change any
37 preference or any relative or other right given to any class or series
38 of outstanding shares, then, in addition to any approval otherwise
39 required, the amendment must be approved by the holders of shares
40 representing a majority of the voting power of each class or series
41 adversely affected by the amendment regardless of limitations or

11 rights of the existing series.

13 requiring, in the case of any specified amendments, approval by a
14 larger proportion of the voting power of stockholders than that

17 different classes of shares for the purpose of voting by classes
18 except when the series is adversely affected by an amendment in a
19 different manner than other series of the same class.
20 5. The board of directors may, by resolution, abandon the
21 proposed amendment without further action by the stockholders if
22 the resolution of the stockholders approving the proposed
23 amendment authorizes the board of directors to do so. The board of
24 directors may, by resolution, abandon a proposed amendment
25 pursuant to subsection 8 without any action by the stockholders.
26 6. A certificate filed pursuant to subsection 1 is effective at the
27 time of the filing of the certificate with the Secretary of State or
28 upon a later date and time as specified in the certificate, which date
29 must not be more than 90 days after the date on which the certificate
