3 This bill makes various changes to business entities.
4 Section 1 of this bill clarifies that the inclusion of certain materials provided

6 the notice or communication. Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change
7 relating to the fiduciary duties of directors and officers of a private corporation for
8 consistency within existing law.
9 Sections 3 and 4 of this bill require that votes relating to the approval of a
10 reverse stock split be approved by the vote of the relevant stockholders of such a
11 class or series of stock. Sections 5 and 9 of this bill remove the phrase “share
12 dividend” from provisions governing the issuance of shares of a private
13 corporation.

15 take certain actions in final form or such preliminary form as the directors deem
16 appropriate in their business judgment.
17 Section 7 of this bill: (1) provides that voting agreements entered into by
18 stockholders may include a private corporation; and (2) makes conforming changes
19 authorizing the reference in such an agreement to facts or events outside of the

21 proposed amendment to the articles of incorporation of a private corporation after
22 the issuance of stock that designates one or more new series of an existing class
23 does not adversely alter or change the preferences or rights of the existing series;
24 and (2) authorizes a publicly traded corporation to amend its articles of
25 incorporation to increase or decrease the shares it is authorized to issue through a
26 stockholder vote.
27 Section 11 of this bill clarifies the notice required if the approval of a
28 dissolution of a corporation was obtained by written consent and replaces the
29 phrase “certificate of dissolution” with “articles of dissolution” for purposes of
30 provisions relating to the dissolution of a corporation. Sections 10-12, 15 and 18-

32 purposes of provisions relating to the dissolution of a corporation or a limited-
33 liability company, as applicable. Section 13 of this bill makes a conforming change
34 to replace “certificate of dissolution” with “record of dissolution.” Section 16 of
35 this bill provides an effective date and time for filing the articles of dissolution of a
36 limited-liability company.

38 address of members and managers of a limited-liability company to be listed for
39 certain records.
40 Section 22 of this bill establishes a new process by which a corporation may:

42 stockholders shares in the new holding corporation in exchange for their previous
43 shares. Section 23 of this bill: (1) revises the steps required for a board of directors

47 conforming change relating to voting for purposes of the new process of
48 reorganization into a holding corporation.

4 may be given or sent by any method of delivery [;] and each
5 agreement, instrument, certificate or other document enclosed
6 with, or annexed or appended to, such notice or other
7 communication shall be deemed part of the notice or
8 communication solely for purposes of determining whether notice
9 was duly given under this title and the organic rules of the entity
10 giving or sending the notice or other communication; and
11 (b) An electronic transmission must be in accordance with this
12 section.
13 2. A notice or other communication given or sent pursuant to
14 the organic law or organic rules of an entity may be delivered by
15 electronic transmission if:
16 (a) Consented to by the recipient or authorized by subsection 9;
17 and
18 (b) The electronic transmission contains or is accompanied by
19 information from which the recipient can determine the date of the

21 3. Any consent under subsection 2 may be revoked by the

23 to whom the consent was delivered. Any such consent is deemed
24 revoked if:
25 (a) The person is unable to receive two consecutive electronic
26 transmissions given by the entity or organization in accordance with
27 such consent; and
28 (b) Such inability becomes known to the secretary of the entity
29 sending the electronic transmissions or to the transfer agent or other
30 person responsible for the giving of notice or other communications.
31  The inadvertent failure to treat any such inability as a revocation
32 does not invalidate any meeting or other action.
33 4. Unless otherwise agreed between sender and recipient, an
34 electronic transmission is received when:
35 (a) It enters an information processing system that the recipient
36 has designated or uses for the purpose of receiving electronic
37 transmissions or information of the type sent; and
38 (b) It is in a form ordinarily capable of being processed by that
39 system.
40 5. Receipt of an electronic acknowledgment from an
41 information processing system described in paragraph (a) of
42 subsection 4 establishes that an electronic transmission was received
-
*AB239*

– 4 –
1 but, by itself, does not establish that the content sent corresponds to
2 the content received.
3 6. An electronic transmission is received under this section
4 even if no natural person is aware of its receipt.
5 7. Except as otherwise provided by specific statute, any notice
6 or other communication, if in a comprehensible form or manner, is
7 effective at the earliest of the following:
8 (a) If in a physical form, when it is left at:

14 (3) The entity’s principal place of business; or

21 (c) If mailed by United States mail postage prepaid and correctly
22 addressed to a recipient other than a stockholder, member, partner or
23 other owner of an entity, the earliest of:
24 (1) If sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt

31  In the absence of fraud, an affidavit of the secretary of the entity
32 or the transfer agent or any other agent of the entity that the notice
33 has been given by a form of electronic transmission is prima facie
34 evidence of the facts stated in the affidavit.
35 8. A notice or other communication may be in the form of an
36 electronic transmission that cannot be directly reproduced in paper
37 form by the recipient through an automated process used in
38 conventional commercial practice only if:
39 (a) The electronic transmission is otherwise retrievable in
40 perceivable form; and
41 (b) The sender and the recipient have consented in writing to the

10 provisions of this section shall be deemed to control to the
11 maximum extent permitted by section 102(a)(2) of that Act, 15

13 11. As used in this section:

37  but a director or officer is not entitled to rely on such
38 information, opinions, reports, books of account or statements if the

25 (a) The board of directors must adopt a resolution setting forth
26 the amendment proposed and submit the proposed amendment to the

33 on the voting power of the affected class or series, must approve
34 the proposed amendment; or

10 2. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, if any
11 proposed amendment would adversely alter or change any

14 required, the amendment must be approved by the holders of shares
15 representing a majority of the voting power of each class or series
16 adversely affected by the amendment regardless of limitations or
17 restrictions on the voting power thereof. The amendment does not
18 have to be approved by the holders of shares [representing a
19 majority of the voting power] of [each] any class or series whose
20 preference or rights are adversely affected by the amendment if the
21 articles of incorporation specifically deny the holders of such class
22 or series the right to vote on such an amendment. Except as
23 otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation, a proposed
24 amendment that designates one or more new series of an existing
25 class as having any preference or any relative or other right that
26 has higher or equal seniority to the corresponding preference or
27 relative or other right of an existing series of the same class does
28 not, solely by virtue of the higher or equal seniority of the

33 requiring, in the case of any specified amendments, approval by a
34 larger proportion of the voting power of stockholders than that

39 different manner than other series of the same class.
40 5. The board of directors may, by resolution, abandon the
41 proposed amendment without further action by the stockholders if
42 the resolution of the stockholders approving the proposed
43 amendment authorizes the board of directors to do so. The board of
44 directors may, by resolution, abandon a proposed amendment

42 officer, director or stockholder must also approve the plan of
43 conversion.

*AB239*

– 35 –

23 provisions of NRS 78.378 to 78.3793, inclusive, or NRS 78.411 to
24 78.444, inclusive.
25 4. As used in this section:

43 the capital stock of the domestic corporation that are the subject of a
44 written agreement requiring such shares to be contributed or
45 otherwise transferred to the other constituent entity in the merger or

– 37 –
1 any of the owned affiliates of the other constituent entity in
2 exchange for shares or other equity interest in the other constituent
3 entity or any of its owned affiliates. Shares must cease to be rollover
4 shares if, as of the effective time of the merger, the shares have not
5 been contributed or otherwise transferred pursuant to the written
6 agreement.
7 Sec. 25. NRS 92A.195 is hereby amended to read as follows:
8 92A.195 1. One foreign entity or foreign general partnership
9 may convert into one domestic entity if:

18 provisions of NRS 92A.205 and 92A.220.
19 2. One domestic entity or domestic general partnership may

22 governing the resulting foreign entity and the resulting foreign entity
23 complies with that law in effecting the conversion; and
24 (b) The domestic entity complies with the applicable provisions
25 of NRS 92A.105, 92A.120, 92A.135, 92A.140, 92A.150, 92A.165,
26 92A.205, 92A.207, 92A.210, 92A.230 and 92A.240.
27 3. When a conversion pursuant to subsection 2 takes effect, the
28 resulting foreign entity shall be deemed to have appointed the
29 Secretary of State as its agent for service of process in a proceeding
30 to enforce any obligation. Service of process must be made
31 personally by delivering to and leaving with the Secretary of State
32 duplicate copies of the process and the payment of a fee of $100 for
33 accepting and transmitting the process. The Secretary of State shall
34 send one of the copies of the process by registered or certified mail
35 to the resulting entity at its specified address, unless the resulting
36 entity has designated in writing to the Secretary of State a different
37 address for that purpose, in which case it must be mailed to the last
38 address so designated.
39 Sec. 26. NRS 92A.380 is hereby amended to read as follows:

44 following corporate actions:
-
*AB239*

– 38 –
1 (a) Consummation of a plan of merger to which the domestic
2 corporation is a constituent entity:
3 (1) If approval by the stockholders is required for the merger
4 by [NRS 92A.120 to 92A.160, inclusive,] this chapter or the articles
5 of incorporation, regardless of whether the stockholder is entitled to
6 vote on the plan of merger;
7 (2) If the domestic corporation is a subsidiary and is merged
8 with its parent pursuant to NRS 92A.180; or
9 (3) If the domestic corporation is a constituent entity in a
10 merger pursuant to NRS 92A.133.
11 (b) Consummation of a plan of conversion to which the
12 domestic corporation is a constituent entity as the corporation whose
13 subject owner’s interests will be converted.
14 (c) Consummation of a plan of exchange to which the domestic
15 corporation is a constituent entity as the corporation whose subject
16 owner’s interests will be acquired, if the stockholder’s shares are to
17 be acquired in the plan of exchange.
18 (d) Any corporate action taken pursuant to a vote of the
19 stockholders to the extent that the articles of incorporation, bylaws
20 or a resolution of the board of directors provides that voting or

30 stockholder’s outstanding shares, except where the stockholder
31 would not be entitled to receive such payment pursuant to NRS
32 78.205, 78.2055 or 78.207. A dissent pursuant to this paragraph
33 applies only to the fraction of a share, and the stockholder is entitled
34 only to obtain payment of the fair value of the fraction of a share.
35 2. A stockholder who is entitled to dissent and obtain payment
36 pursuant to NRS 92A.300 to 92A.500, inclusive, must not otherwise
37 object to or challenge the corporate action creating the entitlement
38 [unless the action is unlawful or constitutes or] , except to the extent
39 that:

6 other distributions on shares. This subsection does not apply to
7 dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders on a date
8 before the effective date of any corporate action from which the
9 stockholder has dissented. If a stockholder exercises the right to
10 dissent with respect to a corporate action described in paragraph (f)
11 of subsection 1, the restrictions of this subsection apply only to the
12 shares to be converted into a fraction of a share and the dividends
13 and distributions to those shares.
