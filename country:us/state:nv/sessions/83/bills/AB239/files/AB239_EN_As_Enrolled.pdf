with, or annexed or appended to, such notice or other
communication shall be deemed part of the notice or
communication solely for purposes of determining whether notice
was duly given under this title and the organic rules of the entity
giving or sending the notice or other communication; and
(b) An electronic transmission must be in accordance with this
section.

the organic law or organic rules of an entity may be delivered by
electronic transmission if:
(a) Consented to by the recipient or authorized by subsection 9;
and

information from which the recipient can determine the date of the

transmissions given by the entity or organization in accordance with
such consent; and
(b) Such inability becomes known to the secretary of the entity
sending the electronic transmissions or to the transfer agent or other
person responsible for the giving of notice or other communications.
 The inadvertent failure to treat any such inability as a revocation
does not invalidate any meeting or other action.

electronic transmission is received when:
(a) It enters an information processing system that the recipient
has designated or uses for the purpose of receiving electronic
transmissions or information of the type sent; and
(b) It is in a form ordinarily capable of being processed by that
system.
5. Receipt of an electronic acknowledgment from an
information processing system described in paragraph (a) of

in subsection 4; and
(e) If oral, when communicated.

electronic transmission that cannot be directly reproduced in paper
form by the recipient through an automated process used in
conventional commercial practice only if:
(a) The electronic transmission is otherwise retrievable in

prohibit delivery of notices of meetings of directors, managers,
members, partners or other owners of the entity by electronic
transmission.

any court of this State must be tried before the presiding judge as
the trier of fact and not before a jury. Upon and during its
effectiveness, any such requirement must conclusively operate as a
waiver of the right to trial by jury by each party to any internal

stockholders who:
(a) Before the decrease in the number of shares becomes
effective, in the aggregate hold 1 percent or more of the outstanding
shares of the affected class or series; and
(b) Would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share

regardless of limitations or restrictions on the voting power thereof.
3. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection [,] and
unless the articles of incorporation require a greater proportion, if
a proposed increase or decrease in the number of authorized shares
of any class or series would adversely alter or change any preference

-
83rd Session (2025)

– 11 –
each class or series whose preference or rights are adversely

 regardless of limitations or restrictions on the voting power
thereof. The increase or decrease does not have to be approved by
the vote of the holders of shares [representing a majority of the
voting power in each] of any class or series whose preference or
rights are adversely affected by the increase or decrease if the
articles of incorporation specifically deny the holders of shares of
such class or series the right to vote on such an increase or
decrease.
4. If any proposed corporate action pursuant to this section
would result in only money being paid or scrip being issued to
stockholders who:

 any stockholder who is obligated, as a result of the corporate
action taken pursuant to this section, to accept money or scrip rather

Sec. 5. NRS 78.215 is hereby amended to read as follows:
78.215 1. A corporation may issue and dispose of its
authorized shares for such consideration as may be prescribed in the
articles of incorporation or, if no consideration is so prescribed, then
for such consideration as may be fixed by the board of directors.
2. If a consideration is prescribed for shares without par value,
that consideration must not be used to determine the fees required
for filing articles of incorporation pursuant to NRS 78.760.
3. Unless the articles of incorporation provide otherwise [,]
and except as otherwise provided by subsection 4, shares may be
issued pro rata and without consideration to the corporation’s
stockholders or to the stockholders of one or more classes or series.
[An issuance of shares under this subsection is a share dividend.]
4. Shares of one class or series may not be issued [as a share
dividend] pursuant to subsection 3 in respect of shares of another
class or series unless:
(a) The articles of incorporation so authorize;
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 12 –
(b) A majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the class or
series to be issued approve the issue; or
(c) There are no outstanding shares of the class or series to be

determining stockholders entitled to [a share dividend,] shares
issued pursuant to subsection 3, it is the date the board of directors
authorizes the [share dividend.] issuance.
Sec. 5.5. NRS 78.240 is hereby amended to read as follows:
78.240 1. The shares of stock in every corporation shall be
personal property and shall be transferable on the books of the

interest and without regard to any other person or interest; and
(b) No stockholder of a corporation, in such person’s capacity
as a stockholder and regardless of the stockholder’s relative
beneficial ownership of share or relative voting power, shall have
any fiduciary duty to the corporation or any other stockholder.
3. The only fiduciary duty of a controlling stockholder of a
corporation, in such person’s capacity as a stockholder, is to
refrain from exerting undue influence over any director or officer
of the corporation with the purpose and proximate effect of
inducing a breach of fiduciary duty by such director or officer:
(a) For which breach the director or officer is liable pursuant
to NRS 78.138; and
(b) Which breach:
(1) Directly relates to the initiation, evaluation, negotiation,

 The exercise or withholding of voting power by a controlling
stockholder, or the indication or implication by a controlling
stockholder as to whether or to what extent such voting power may
be exercised or withheld, does not, by itself, constitute or indicate a
breach of the fiduciary duty imposed by this subsection.
4. A controlling stockholder is presumed to have not

disinterested directors.

rebutted; and
(c) It is proven that the stockholder’s act or failure to act
constituted a breach of the stockholder’s fiduciary duty imposed
by subsection 3.

agreement or the latest extension, files a duplicate of the agreement
providing for the extension in the registered office of the
corporation. An agreement providing for an extension does not
affect the rights or obligations of any person not a party to that
agreement. An agreement entered into pursuant to the provisions of
subsection 1 is not invalidated by the fact that, by its terms, its
duration is more than 15 years, but its duration shall be deemed
amended to conform with the provisions of this section.

occurrence of an event, including, without limitation, a
determination or action by a person, the corporation itself or any
government, governmental agency or political subdivision of a
government.
4. An agreement pursuant to the provisions of subsection 3 is
valid and enforceable against the transferee of a stockholder party to
the agreement only:
(a) If and to the extent that the transferee agrees in writing to be
bound by the agreement; or

the articles of incorporation must be made and approved in the
following manner:
(a) The board of directors must adopt a resolution setting forth
the amendment proposed and submit the proposed amendment to the
stockholders for approval [.
(b) If] and if the corporation is:
(1) A publicly traded corporation and the amendment
proposed relates solely to an increase or decrease in the number of
shares the corporation is authorized to issue, the stockholders of
the affected class or series, regardless of limitations or restrictions
on the voting power of the affected class or series, must approve
the proposed amendment; or
(2) Not a publicly traded corporation, or is a publicly traded
corporation but the amendment proposed does not relate solely to
an increase or decrease in the number of shares the corporation is
authorized to issue, the stockholders holding shares in the
corporation representing at least a majority of the voting power, or
such greater proportion of the voting power as may be required in
the case of a vote by classes or series, as provided in subsections 2
and 4, or as may be required by the provisions of the articles of
incorporation, [have approved] must approve the proposed
amendment.

setting forth the articles of incorporation as amended, and the vote

[(c)] (b) The certificate so signed must be filed with the
Secretary of State.
(c) An amendment adopted pursuant to this subsection that
would have the effect of decreasing the number of shares of a
class or series of shares the corporation is authorized to issue
below the number of shares of such class or series then issued and
outstanding shall be void and of no effect.
2. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, if any
proposed amendment would adversely alter or change any
preference or any relative or other right given to any class or series
of outstanding shares, then, in addition to any approval otherwise
required, the amendment must be approved by the holders of shares
representing a majority of the voting power of each class or series
adversely affected by the amendment regardless of limitations or
restrictions on the voting power thereof. The amendment does not
have to be approved by the holders of shares [representing a
majority of the voting power] of [each] any class or series whose
preference or rights are adversely affected by the amendment if the
articles of incorporation specifically deny the holders of such class
or series the right to vote on such an amendment. Except as
otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation, a proposed
amendment that designates one or more new series of an existing
class as having any preference or any relative or other right that
has higher or equal seniority to the corresponding preference or
relative or other right of an existing series of the same class does
not, solely by virtue of the higher or equal seniority of the
preference or right of the proposed new series, constitute an
amendment that would adversely alter or change the preference or
rights of the existing series.
3. Provision may be made in the articles of incorporation
requiring, in the case of any specified amendments, approval by a
larger proportion of the voting power of stockholders than that
required by this section.
4. Different series of the same class of shares do not constitute
different classes of shares for the purpose of voting by classes
except when the series is adversely affected by an amendment in a
different manner than other series of the same class.

proposed amendment without further action by the stockholders if
the resolution of the stockholders approving the proposed
amendment authorizes the board of directors to do so. The board of
directors may, by resolution, abandon a proposed amendment
pursuant to subsection 8 without any action by the stockholders.

time of the filing of the certificate with the Secretary of State or

must not be more than 90 days after the date on which the certificate
is filed. If a certificate filed pursuant to subsection 1 specifies a later
effective date but does not specify an effective time, the certificate
is effective at 12:01 a.m. in the Pacific time zone on the specified
later date.
7. If a certificate filed pursuant to subsection 1 specifies a later
effective date or time and if the board of directors is authorized to
abandon the proposed amendment pursuant to subsection 5, the
board of directors may terminate the effectiveness of the certificate
by resolution and by filing a certificate of termination with the
Secretary of State that:
(a) Is filed before the effective time of the certificate filed with
the Secretary of State pursuant to subsection 1;
(b) Identifies the certificate being terminated;

the effectiveness of the certificate;
(d) States that the effectiveness of the certificate has been
terminated;
(e) Is signed by an officer of the corporation; and
(f) Is accompanied by a filing fee of $175.
8. No action by the stockholders is required if the proposed
amendment to the articles of incorporation consists only of a change
in the name of the corporation. The articles of incorporation may
forbid a corporation from amending the articles of incorporation
pursuant to this subsection without stockholder approval.

this section, would be entitled to vote on the approval of the plan of
merger. The other constituent entity in the merger may, but is not
required to, engage in the consummation of separate offers for
separate classes or series of the stock of the domestic corporation.
An offer may, but is not required to:
(1) Exclude any excluded shares; and
(2) Be conditioned on the tender of a minimum number or
proportion of shares of any class or series of the stock of the
domestic corporation.
(f) “Owned affiliate” means, with respect to a constituent entity,
any other person who owns, directly or indirectly, all of the
outstanding equity interests of the constituent entity, or any direct or
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the constituent entity or other
person.
(g) “Ownership threshold requirement” means that the voting
power of the stock of the domestic corporation otherwise owned
beneficially or of record by the other constituent entity in the merger
or any of the owned affiliates of the other constituent entity,
together with the voting power of any rollover shares and any shares
irrevocably accepted for purchase or exchange pursuant to any offer
and received before the expiration of the offer by the agent or
depositary appointed to facilitate the consummation of the offer,
equals at least that proportion of the voting power of the stock, and
of each class or series thereof, of the domestic corporation that,
absent this section, would be required to approve the plan of merger
under this chapter and the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the
domestic corporation. For the purposes of this paragraph, shares are
received:
(1) If the shares are certificated shares, upon physical receipt
by the agent or depositary of a stock certificate with an executed
letter of transmittal or other instrument of transfer;
(2) If the shares are uncertificated shares held of record by a
clearing corporation as nominee, upon transfer into the account of
the agent or depositary by way of an agent’s message; and
(3) If the shares are uncertificated shares held of record by a
person other than a clearing corporation as nominee, upon physical
receipt by the agent or depositary of an executed letter of transmittal
or other instrument of transfer.
(h) “Publicly traded corporation” means a domestic corporation
that has a class or series of voting shares which is a covered security

U.S.C. § 77r(b)(1)(A) or (B), as amended.
(i) “Rollover shares” means any shares of any class or series of
the capital stock of the domestic corporation that are the subject of a
written agreement requiring such shares to be contributed or
otherwise transferred to the other constituent entity in the merger or
any of the owned affiliates of the other constituent entity in
exchange for shares or other equity interest in the other constituent
entity or any of its owned affiliates. Shares must cease to be rollover
shares if, as of the effective time of the merger, the shares have not
been contributed or otherwise transferred pursuant to the written
agreement.
Sec. 25. NRS 92A.195 is hereby amended to read as follows:
92A.195 1. One foreign entity or foreign general partnership

(b) The foreign entity or foreign general partnership complies
with the applicable provisions of NRS 92A.205, 92A.207, 92A.210,

Sec. 26. NRS 92A.380 is hereby amended to read as follows:
92A.380 1. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 92A.370
and 92A.390 and subject to the limitation in paragraph (f), any
stockholder is entitled to dissent from, and obtain payment of the
fair value of the stockholder’s shares in the event of any of the
following corporate actions:
(a) Consummation of a plan of merger to which the domestic
corporation is a constituent entity:
(1) If approval by the stockholders is required for the merger
by [NRS 92A.120 to 92A.160, inclusive,] this chapter or the articles
of incorporation, regardless of whether the stockholder is entitled to
vote on the plan of merger;
(2) If the domestic corporation is a subsidiary and is merged
with its parent pursuant to NRS 92A.180; or
(3) If the domestic corporation is a constituent entity in a
merger pursuant to NRS 92A.133.
(b) Consummation of a plan of conversion to which the
domestic corporation is a constituent entity as the corporation whose
subject owner’s interests will be converted.
(c) Consummation of a plan of exchange to which the domestic

owner’s interests will be acquired, if the stockholder’s shares are to
be acquired in the plan of exchange.
(d) Any corporate action taken pursuant to a vote of the
stockholders to the extent that the articles of incorporation, bylaws
or a resolution of the board of directors provides that voting or
nonvoting stockholders are entitled to dissent and obtain payment
for their shares.
(e) Accordance of full voting rights to control shares, as defined
in NRS 78.3784, only to the extent provided for pursuant to
NRS 78.3793.
(f) Any corporate action not described in this subsection

would not be entitled to receive such payment pursuant to NRS
78.205, 78.2055 or 78.207. A dissent pursuant to this paragraph
applies only to the fraction of a share, and the stockholder is entitled
only to obtain payment of the fair value of the fraction of a share.

2. A stockholder who is entitled to dissent and obtain payment
pursuant to NRS 92A.300 to 92A.500, inclusive, must not otherwise
object to or challenge the corporate action creating the entitlement
[unless the action is unlawful or constitutes or] , except to the extent
that:
(a) The domestic corporation did not obtain the vote or consent
of the requisite voting power of the stockholders to approve the
action as prescribed under this chapter and the articles of
incorporation and bylaws of the domestic corporation; or
(b) The corporate action is the proximate result of actual fraud
against the stockholder or the domestic corporation.
3. Subject to the limitations in this subsection, from and after
the effective date of any corporate action described in subsection 1,
no stockholder who has exercised the right to dissent pursuant to
NRS 92A.300 to 92A.500, inclusive, is entitled to vote his or her
shares for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or any
other distributions on shares. This subsection does not apply to
dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders on a date
before the effective date of any corporate action from which the

of subsection 1, the restrictions of this subsection apply only to the
shares to be converted into a fraction of a share and the dividends
and distributions to those shares.
Sec. 27. This act becomes effective upon passage and
approval.
