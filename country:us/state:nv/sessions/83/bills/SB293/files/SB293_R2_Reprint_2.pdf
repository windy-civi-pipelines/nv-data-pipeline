9 of the name, image or likeness of the student athlete by an organization other than
10 the institution or a national collegiate athletic association. (NRS 398.045, 398.300)
11 Section 1 of this bill eliminates these prohibitions.

13 federal laws governing copyrights or enlarge, diminish or affect in
14 any other manner the rights of a person in any written book or
15 record which is copyrighted pursuant to federal law.
16 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record

19 public book or record shall not deny a request made pursuant to
