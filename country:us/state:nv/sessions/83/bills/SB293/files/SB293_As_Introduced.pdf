Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits a public or private institution that offers educational
2 services beyond the secondary level from: (1) upholding or enforcing certain rules
3 that prevent student athletes from being compensated for the use of the name,
4 image or likeness of the student athlete by the institution or a national collegiate
5 association; (2) compensating a current student athlete of the institution for the use
6 of the name, image or likeness of the student athlete; or (3) altering, withholding or
7 otherwise reducing the amount of a scholarship awarded to a student athlete
8 because the student athlete is compensated for the use of the name, image or
9 likeness of the student athlete by the institution or a national collegiate athletic
10 association. (NRS 398.045, 398.300) Section 1 of this bill eliminates these
11 prohibitions.
12 Existing law authorizes a student athlete to enter into a contract with an
13 organization other than an institution or a national collegiate athletic association
14 that provides for the student athlete to be compensated for the use of the name,
15 image or likeness of the student athlete. (NRS 398.310) Section 2 of this bill
16 authorizes a student athlete to enter into such a contract with an institution or a
17 national collegiate athletic association.
