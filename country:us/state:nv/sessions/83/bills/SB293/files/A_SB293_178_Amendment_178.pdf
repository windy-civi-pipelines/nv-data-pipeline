EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; revising provisions relating to the compensation of
student athletes for use of their name, image or likeness; revising
provisions relating to contracts for compensation for the use of the
name, image or likeness of student athletes; making confidential
certain information and contracts relating to the compensation of
student athletes for the use of their name, image or likeness; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits a public or private institution that offers educational services
2 beyond the secondary level from: (1) upholding or enforcing certain rules that prevent student
3 athletes from being compensated for the use of the name, image or likeness of the student
4 athlete by an organization other than the institution or a national collegiate association; (2)
5 compensating a current student athlete of the institution for the use of the name, image or
6 likeness of the student athlete; or (3) altering, withholding or otherwise reducing the amount
7 of a scholarship awarded to a student athlete because the student athlete is compensated for
8 the use of the name, image or likeness of the student athlete by an organization other than
9 the institution or a national collegiate athletic association. (NRS 398.045, 398.300) Section 1
10 of this bill eliminates these prohibitions.
11 Existing law authorizes a student athlete to enter into a contract with an organization
12 other than an institution or a national collegiate athletic association that provides for the
13 student athlete to be compensated for the use of the name, image or likeness of the student
14 athlete. (NRS 398.310) Section 2 of this bill authorizes a student athlete to enter into such a
15 contract with an institution or a national collegiate athletic association. Section 2 also
16 provides that any gift, donation, bequest, grant or other source of money received by a
17 university foundation which is specifically designated for supporting any aspect of the
18 name, image or likeness of a student athlete must only be used for the purpose specified
19 by the donor. Sections 2 and 2.5 of this bill provide that such contracts entered into by a
20 student athlete and materials relating to such contracts are confidential and are not
21 public records.

Senate Amendment No. 178 to Senate Bill No. 293 Page 7
1 office hours to inspection by any person, and may be fully copied or an abstract or
2 memorandum may be prepared from those public books and public records. Any
3 such copies, abstracts or memoranda may be used to supply the general public with
4 copies, abstracts or memoranda of the records or may be used in any other way to
5 the advantage of the governmental entity or of the general public. This section does
6 not supersede or in any manner affect the federal laws governing copyrights or
7 enlarge, diminish or affect in any other manner the rights of a person in any written
8 book or record which is copyrighted pursuant to federal law.
9 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record which is
10 copyrighted solely because it is copyrighted.
11 3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a public book or
12 record shall not deny a request made pursuant to subsection 1 to inspect or copy or
13 receive a copy of a public book or record on the basis that the requested public
14 book or record contains information that is confidential if the governmental entity
15 can redact, delete, conceal or separate, including, without limitation, electronically,
16 the confidential information from the information included in the public book or
17 record that is not otherwise confidential.
18 4. If requested, a governmental entity shall provide a copy of a public record
19 in an electronic format by means of an electronic medium. Nothing in this
20 subsection requires a governmental entity to provide a copy of a public record in an
21 electronic format or by means of an electronic medium if:
22 (a) The public record:
23 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
24 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
25 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by means of an
26 electronic medium would:
27 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
28 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential and that
29 cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from information that is not
30 otherwise confidential.
31 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who has legal
32 custody or control of a public record:
33 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the medium that
34 is requested because the officer, employee or agent has already prepared or would
35 prefer to provide the copy in a different medium.
36 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon request, prepare
37 the copy of the public record and shall not require the person who has requested the
38 copy to prepare the copy himself or herself.
39 Sec. 3. This act becomes effective on July 1, 2025.
