Senate Bill No. 293–Senator Lange
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to education; revising provisions relating to the
compensation of student athletes for the use of their name,
image or likeness; revising provisions relating to contracts for
compensation for the use of the name, image or likeness of
student athletes; making confidential certain information and
contracts relating to the compensation of student athletes for
the use of their name, image or likeness; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law prohibits a public or private institution that offers educational
services beyond the secondary level from: (1) upholding or enforcing certain rules
that prevent student athletes from being compensated for the use of the name,
image or likeness of the student athlete by an organization other than the institution
or a national collegiate association; (2) compensating a current student athlete of
the institution for the use of the name, image or likeness of the student athlete; or
(3) altering, withholding or otherwise reducing the amount of a scholarship
awarded to a student athlete because the student athlete is compensated for the use
of the name, image or likeness of the student athlete by an organization other than
the institution or a national collegiate athletic association. (NRS 398.045, 398.300)
Section 1 of this bill eliminates these prohibitions.
Existing law authorizes a student athlete to enter into a contract with an
organization other than an institution or a national collegiate athletic association
that provides for the student athlete to be compensated for the use of the name,
image or likeness of the student athlete. (NRS 398.310) Section 2 of this bill
authorizes a student athlete to enter into such a contract with an institution or a
national collegiate athletic association. Sections 2 and 2.5 of this bill provide that
such contracts entered into by a student athlete and materials relating to such
contracts are confidential and are not public records.
