21 as practicable, be segregated from offenders whose crimes were
22 violent and, insofar as practicable, be assigned to an institution or
23 facility of minimum security.
24 4. A prosecuting attorney shall not dismiss a charge of
25 homicide by vessel in exchange for a plea of guilty, guilty but
26 mentally ill or nolo contendere to a lesser charge or for any other
27 reason unless the prosecuting attorney knows or it is obvious that
28 the charge is not supported by probable cause or cannot be proved at
29 the time of trial. A sentence imposed pursuant to subsection 2 may
30 not be suspended nor may probation be granted.
31 5. If consumption is proven by a preponderance of the
32 evidence, it is an affirmative defense under subparagraph (3) of

34 sufficient quantity of alcohol after operating or being in actual
35 physical control of the power-driven vessel or sailing vessel, as
36 applicable, under way and before his or her blood or breath was
37 tested, to cause the defendant to have a concentration of alcohol of
38 0.08 or more in his or her blood or breath. A defendant who intends
39 to offer this defense at a trial or preliminary hearing must, not less
40 than 14 days before the trial or hearing or at such other time as the
41 court may direct, file and serve on the prosecuting attorney a written
42 notice of that intent.
43 6. If the defendant was transporting a person who is less than
44 15 years of age in the power-driven vessel or sailing vessel, as
45 applicable, under way at the time of the violation, the court shall

7 way while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or a controlled
8 substance or resulting from any other conduct prohibited by this
9 section or NRS 488.410 or 488.420; or
