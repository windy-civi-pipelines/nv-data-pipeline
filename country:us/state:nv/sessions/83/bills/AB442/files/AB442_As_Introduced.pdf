AN ACT relating to state financial administration; declaring the

corporations under a grant agreement within a certain
period of time; with certain exceptions, imposing interest
on amounts due under a written grant agreement which

requiring state entities that make grants to take certain
actions upon the receipt of an invoice; authorizing the use
of media other than original paper documents to expedite

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 With certain exceptions, this bill enacts requirements governing payments by
2 agencies of the Executive Department of the State Government to private nonprofit
3 corporations that receive grants from those agencies and are reimbursed by those
4 agencies for services or other performance under a grant agreement. Section 3 of
5 this bill defines the term “grant” to establish the types of financial assistance to
6 which these requirements apply. Section 8 of this bill declares that it is the policy
7 of this State to: (1) complete all processing and authorization required by law to
8 make a payment, as defined in section 4 of this bill, within 30 calendar days after
9 the later of the date on which the payment becomes due under a grant agreement or
10 the date on which the state entity that made the grant receives a proper invoice, as
11 defined in section 6 of this bill; and (2) make an advance of a grant to a private
12 nonprofit corporation to facilitate the expeditious carrying out of the grant.

13 Section 9 of this bill provides that, with certain exceptions, a state entity that makes
14 a grant to a private nonprofit corporation, which is defined in section 7 of this bill
15 as a “state grant-making entity,” is liable for interest on amounts which are due and
16 payable under a written grant agreement at the rate that has been agreed upon in the
17 grant agreement, or if no such rate has been agreed upon, by a specified rate.
18 Section 9 provides that, with certain exceptions, interest begins accruing on the
19 31st calendar day after the date on which the state grant-making entity receives a
20 proper invoice and requires interest to be paid from the operating budget of the
21 state grant-making entity, not including money appropriated to fund a grant.
22 Section 10 of this bill requires a state grant-making entity to mark an invoice
23 with the date on which the invoice was received and review the invoice as soon as
24 practicable to determine whether the invoice is a proper invoice. Section 10
25 authorizes a state grant-making entity to use media that produce tangible recordings
26 of information to expedite payment in lieu of requiring original paper documents.
27 Section 11 of this bill authorizes a private nonprofit corporation to submit to a
28 state grant-making entity a request for an advance of money from the grant that was
29 awarded to the private nonprofit corporation by the state grant-making entity.
30 Section 11 requires the private nonprofit corporation to: (1) submit an expenditure
31 plan with its request for an advance and any other information requested by the
32 state grant-making entity; and (2) agree to requirements relating to reporting
33 expenditures, returning unexpended money and depositing the advance. Section 11,
34 with certain exceptions, requires, to the greatest extent practicable, the state grant-
35 making entity to approve the advance if it determines that the private nonprofit
36 corporation has demonstrated sufficient justification for the advance and, if
37 applicable, it has verified compliance by recipients of subgrants with the grant
38 agreement and applicable law. With certain exceptions, section 11 limits the
39 amount of such an advance to be: (1) if the source of funding for the grant is state
40 money, the amount requested by the private nonprofit corporation, but not to
41 exceed 25 percent of the annual amount of the grant award; or (2) if the source of
42 the grant is federal money, the minimum amount to cover the immediate cash
43 requirements of the private nonprofit corporation in carrying out the purpose of the
44 grant.
45 Section 11 requires the State Board of Examiners to adopt policies and
46 procedures to carry out that provision, which are required under existing law to be
47 published in the State Administrative Manual. (NRS 232.004) Section 11 also
48 requires: (1) the state grant-making entity to provide written notice of the approval
49 of any advance to the Director of the Office of Finance; and (2) the Director to
50 submit an annual report to the Interim Finance Committee relating to advance
51 payments of which the Director was notified.
52 Section 13 of this bill excludes from the requirements of this bill grants which
53 are executed, renewed or extended before July 1, 2026.
