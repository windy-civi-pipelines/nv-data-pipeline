EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to state financial administration; declaring the
policy of this State to make payments to private nonprofit
corporations under a grant agreement within a certain
period of time and to make advance payments of grants to
such corporations; with certain exceptions, imposing
interest on amounts due under a written grant agreement
which are not timely paid after receipt of a proper invoice;
requiring state entities that make grants to take certain
actions upon the receipt of an invoice; authorizing the use
of media other than original paper documents to expedite
grant payments; revising provisions relating to advance
payments of grants to private nonprofit corporations; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 With certain exceptions, this bill enacts requirements governing payments by
2 agencies of the Executive Department of the State Government to private nonprofit
3 corporations that receive grants from those agencies and are reimbursed by those
4 agencies for services or other performance under a grant agreement. Section 3 of
5 this bill defines the term “grant” to establish the types of financial assistance to
6 which these requirements apply. Section 8 of this bill declares that it is the policy
7 of this State to: (1) complete all processing and authorization required by law to
8 make a payment, as defined in section 4 of this bill, within 30 calendar days after
9 receipt of a proper invoice, as defined in section 6 of this bill; and (2) make an
10 advance of a grant to a private nonprofit corporation to facilitate the expeditious
11 carrying out of the grant. Section 8.5 of this bill requires the State Board of
-

– 2 –
12 Examiners to adopt policies and procedures to carry out the provisions of this bill,
13 which are required under existing law to be published in the State Administrative
14 Manual. (NRS 232.004) Section 8.5 mandates that such policies and procedures
15 include a requirement that a summary of the provisions relating to prompt
16 payments and advance payments be included in each grant agreement with a private
17 nonprofit corporation.
18 Section 9 of this bill provides that, with certain exceptions, a state entity that
19 makes a grant to a private nonprofit corporation, which is defined in section 7 of
20 this bill as a “state grant-making entity,” is liable for interest on amounts which are
21 due and payable under a written grant agreement at the rate that has been agreed
22 upon in the grant agreement, or if no such rate has been agreed upon, by a specified
23 rate. Section 9 provides that, with certain exceptions, interest begins accruing on
24 the 31st calendar day after the date on which the state grant-making entity receives
25 a proper invoice and requires interest to be paid from the operating budget of the
26 state grant-making entity, not including money appropriated to fund a grant.
27 Section 9 also requires a state grant-making entity that does not make a payment
28 that is due and payable under a written grant agreement within 30 calendar days
29 after receipt of a proper invoice to: (1) provide written notice to the private
30 nonprofit corporation of the reason for the delay in making the payment; and (2)
31 make a written record of the delayed payment and submit an annual compilation of
32 such records to the Director of the Office of Finance.
33 Section 10 of this bill requires a state grant-making entity to mark an invoice
34 with the date on which the invoice was received and review the invoice as soon as
35 practicable to determine whether the invoice is a proper invoice. Section 10
36 authorizes a state grant-making entity to use media that produce tangible recordings
37 of information to expedite payment in lieu of requiring original paper documents.
38 Section 11 of this bill authorizes a private nonprofit corporation to submit to a
39 state grant-making entity a request for an advance of money from the grant that was
40 awarded to the private nonprofit corporation by the state grant-making entity.
41 Section 11 requires the private nonprofit corporation to: (1) submit an expenditure
42 plan with its request for an advance and any other information requested by the
43 state grant-making entity; and (2) agree to requirements relating to reporting
44 expenditures, returning unexpended money, depositing the advance and reporting
45 related interest. Section 11, with certain exceptions, authorizes the state grant-
46 making entity to approve the advance if it makes specific determinations and
47 verifications. With certain exceptions, section 11 limits the amount of such an
48 advance to be: (1) if the source of funding for the grant is state money, the amount
49 requested by the private nonprofit corporation, but not to exceed 25 percent of the
50 amount of the grant award; or (2) if the source of the grant is federal money, the
51 minimum amount to cover the immediate cash requirements of the private nonprofit
52 corporation in carrying out the purpose of the grant. Section 11 prohibits a state
53 grant-making entity from making an advance if the entity does not have sufficient
54 budgetary authority or a sufficient cash balance to pay the advance.
55 Section 11 requires: (1) the state grant-making entity to provide written notice
56 of the approval of any advance to the Director of the Office of Finance; and (2) the
57 Director to submit an annual report to the Interim Finance Committee relating to
58 advance payments of which the Director was notified.
59 Section 14 of this bill makes this bill effective on July 1, 2026, and section 13
60 of this bill excludes from the requirements of this bill grants which are executed,
61 renewed or extended before July 1, 2026.
