EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to state financial administration; declaring the policy of this State
to make payments to private nonprofit corporations under a grant
agreement within a certain period of time [;] and to make advance
payments of grants to such corporations; with certain exceptions,
imposing interest on amounts due under a written grant agreement
which are not timely paid after receipt of a proper invoice; requiring
state entities that make grants to take certain actions upon the receipt of
an invoice; authorizing the use of media other than original paper
documents to expedite grant payments; revising provisions relating to
advance payments of grants to private nonprofit corporations; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 With certain exceptions, this bill enacts requirements governing payments by agencies of
2 the Executive Department of the State Government to private nonprofit corporations that
3 receive grants from those agencies and are reimbursed by those agencies for services or other
4 performance under a grant agreement. Section 3 of this bill defines the term “grant” to
5 establish the types of financial assistance to which these requirements apply. Section 8 of this
6 bill declares that it is the policy of this State to: (1) complete all processing and authorization
7 required by law to make a payment, as defined in section 4 of this bill, within 30 calendar
8 days after [the later of the date on which the payment becomes due under a grant agreement or
9 the date on which the state entity that made the grant receives] receipt of a proper invoice, as
10 defined in section 6 of this bill; and (2) make an advance of a grant to a private nonprofit
11 corporation to facilitate the expeditious carrying out of the grant. Section 8.5 of this bill
12 requires the State Board of Examiners to adopt policies and procedures to carry out the
13 provisions of this bill, which are required under existing law to be published in the State
14 Administrative Manual. (NRS 232.004) Section 8.5 mandates that such policies and
15 procedures include a requirement that a summary of the provisions relating to prompt
16 payments and advance payments be included in each grant agreement with a private
17 nonprofit corporation.
Assembly Amendment No. 282 to Assembly Bill No. 442 Page 4
18 Section 9 of this bill provides that, with certain exceptions, a state entity that makes a
19 grant to a private nonprofit corporation, which is defined in section 7 of this bill as a “state
20 grant-making entity,” is liable for interest on amounts which are due and payable under a
21 written grant agreement at the rate that has been agreed upon in the grant agreement, or if no
22 such rate has been agreed upon, by a specified rate. Section 9 provides that, with certain
23 exceptions, interest begins accruing on the 31st calendar day after the date on which the state
24 grant-making entity receives a proper invoice and requires interest to be paid from the
25 operating budget of the state grant-making entity, not including money appropriated to fund a
26 grant. Section 9 also requires a state grant-making entity that does not make a payment
27 that is due and payable under a written grant agreement within 30 calendar days after
28 receipt of a proper invoice to: (1) provide written notice to the private nonprofit
29 corporation of the reason for the delay in making the payment; and (2) make a written
30 record of the delayed payment and submit an annual compilation of such records to the
31 Director of the Office of Finance.
32 Section 10 of this bill requires a state grant-making entity to mark an invoice with the
33 date on which the invoice was received and review the invoice as soon as practicable to
34 determine whether the invoice is a proper invoice. Section 10 authorizes a state grant-making
35 entity to use media that produce tangible recordings of information to expedite payment in
36 lieu of requiring original paper documents.
37 Section 11 of this bill authorizes a private nonprofit corporation to submit to a state grant-
38 making entity a request for an advance of money from the grant that was awarded to the
39 private nonprofit corporation by the state grant-making entity. Section 11 requires the private
40 nonprofit corporation to: (1) submit an expenditure plan with its request for an advance and
41 any other information requested by the state grant-making entity; and (2) agree to
42 requirements relating to reporting expenditures, returning unexpended money , [and]
43 depositing the advance [.] and reporting related interest. Section 11, with certain
44 exceptions, [requires, to the greatest extent practicable,] authorizes the state grant-making
45 entity to approve the advance if it [determines that the private nonprofit corporation has
46 demonstrated sufficient justification for the advance and, if applicable, it has verified
47 compliance by recipients of subgrants with the grant agreement and applicable law.] makes
48 specific determinations and verifications. With certain exceptions, section 11 limits the
49 amount of such an advance to be: (1) if the source of funding for the grant is state money, the
50 amount requested by the private nonprofit corporation, but not to exceed 25 percent of the
51 [annual] amount of the grant award; or (2) if the source of the grant is federal money, the
52 minimum amount to cover the immediate cash requirements of the private nonprofit
53 corporation in carrying out the purpose of the grant. Section 11 prohibits a state grant-
54 making entity from making an advance if the entity does not have sufficient budgetary
55 authority or a sufficient cash balance to pay the advance.
56 [Section 11 requires the State Board of Examiners to adopt policies and procedures to
57 carry out that provision, which are required under existing law to be published in the State
58 Administrative Manual. (NRS 232.004)] Section 11 [also] requires: (1) the state grant-making
59 entity to provide written notice of the approval of any advance to the Director of the Office of
60 Finance; and (2) the Director to submit an annual report to the Interim Finance Committee
61 relating to advance payments of which the Director was notified.
62 Section 14 of this bill makes this bill effective on July 1, 2026, and section 13 of this
63 bill excludes from the requirements of this bill grants which are executed, renewed or
64 extended before July 1, 2026.

payments of grants to such corporations; with certain exceptions,
imposing interest on amounts due under a written grant agreement
which are not timely paid after receipt of a proper invoice; requiring
state entities that make grants to take certain actions upon the receipt of
an invoice; authorizing the use of media other than original paper
documents to expedite grant payments; revising provisions relating to
advance payments of grants to private nonprofit corporations; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 With certain exceptions, this bill enacts requirements governing payments by agencies of
2 the Executive Department of the State Government to private nonprofit corporations that
3 receive grants from those agencies and are reimbursed by those agencies for services or other
4 performance under a grant agreement. Section 3 of this bill defines the term “grant” to
5 establish the types of financial assistance to which these requirements apply. Section 8 of this
6 bill declares that it is the policy of this State to: (1) complete all processing and authorization
7 required by law to make a payment, as defined in section 4 of this bill, within 30 calendar
8 days after [the later of the date on which the payment becomes due under a grant agreement or
9 the date on which the state entity that made the grant receives] receipt of a proper invoice, as
10 defined in section 6 of this bill; and (2) make an advance of a grant to a private nonprofit
11 corporation to facilitate the expeditious carrying out of the grant. Section 8.5 of this bill
12 requires the State Board of Examiners to adopt policies and procedures to carry out the
13 provisions of this bill, which are required under existing law to be published in the State
14 Administrative Manual. (NRS 232.004) Section 8.5 mandates that such policies and
15 procedures include a requirement that a summary of the provisions relating to prompt
16 payments and advance payments be included in each grant agreement with a private
17 nonprofit corporation.

Assembly Amendment No. 282 to Assembly Bill No. 442 Page 4
18 Section 9 of this bill provides that, with certain exceptions, a state entity that makes a
19 grant to a private nonprofit corporation, which is defined in section 7 of this bill as a “state
20 grant-making entity,” is liable for interest on amounts which are due and payable under a
21 written grant agreement at the rate that has been agreed upon in the grant agreement, or if no
22 such rate has been agreed upon, by a specified rate. Section 9 provides that, with certain
23 exceptions, interest begins accruing on the 31st calendar day after the date on which the state
24 grant-making entity receives a proper invoice and requires interest to be paid from the
25 operating budget of the state grant-making entity, not including money appropriated to fund a
26 grant. Section 9 also requires a state grant-making entity that does not make a payment
27 that is due and payable under a written grant agreement within 30 calendar days after
28 receipt of a proper invoice to: (1) provide written notice to the private nonprofit
29 corporation of the reason for the delay in making the payment; and (2) make a written
30 record of the delayed payment and submit an annual compilation of such records to the
31 Director of the Office of Finance.
32 Section 10 of this bill requires a state grant-making entity to mark an invoice with the
33 date on which the invoice was received and review the invoice as soon as practicable to
34 determine whether the invoice is a proper invoice. Section 10 authorizes a state grant-making
35 entity to use media that produce tangible recordings of information to expedite payment in
36 lieu of requiring original paper documents.
37 Section 11 of this bill authorizes a private nonprofit corporation to submit to a state grant-
38 making entity a request for an advance of money from the grant that was awarded to the
39 private nonprofit corporation by the state grant-making entity. Section 11 requires the private
40 nonprofit corporation to: (1) submit an expenditure plan with its request for an advance and
41 any other information requested by the state grant-making entity; and (2) agree to
42 requirements relating to reporting expenditures, returning unexpended money , [and]
43 depositing the advance [.] and reporting related interest. Section 11, with certain
44 exceptions, [requires, to the greatest extent practicable,] authorizes the state grant-making
45 entity to approve the advance if it [determines that the private nonprofit corporation has
46 demonstrated sufficient justification for the advance and, if applicable, it has verified
47 compliance by recipients of subgrants with the grant agreement and applicable law.] makes
48 specific determinations and verifications. With certain exceptions, section 11 limits the
49 amount of such an advance to be: (1) if the source of funding for the grant is state money, the
50 amount requested by the private nonprofit corporation, but not to exceed 25 percent of the
51 [annual] amount of the grant award; or (2) if the source of the grant is federal money, the
52 minimum amount to cover the immediate cash requirements of the private nonprofit
53 corporation in carrying out the purpose of the grant. Section 11 prohibits a state grant-
54 making entity from making an advance if the entity does not have sufficient budgetary
55 authority or a sufficient cash balance to pay the advance.
56 [Section 11 requires the State Board of Examiners to adopt policies and procedures to
57 carry out that provision, which are required under existing law to be published in the State
58 Administrative Manual. (NRS 232.004)] Section 11 [also] requires: (1) the state grant-making
59 entity to provide written notice of the approval of any advance to the Director of the Office of
60 Finance; and (2) the Director to submit an annual report to the Interim Finance Committee
61 relating to advance payments of which the Director was notified.
62 Section 14 of this bill makes this bill effective on July 1, 2026, and section 13 of this
63 bill excludes from the requirements of this bill grants which are executed, renewed or
64 extended before July 1, 2026.
