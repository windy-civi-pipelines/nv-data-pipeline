AN ACT relating to state financial administration; [declaring the policy of this
State to make payments to private nonprofit corporations under a grant
agreement within a certain period of time and to make advance
payments of grants to such corporations; with certain exceptions,
imposing interest on amounts due under a written grant agreement
which are not timely paid after receipt of a proper invoice; requiring
state entities that make grants to take certain actions upon the receipt of
an invoice; authorizing the use of media other than original paper
documents to expedite grant payments; revising provisions relating to
advance payments of grants to private nonprofit corporations;]
requiring a state grant-making entity to provide written notice to a
private nonprofit corporation when a payment under a grant
agreement is not made within a certain period of time; authorizing
the Office of Federal Assistance to coordinate and collaborate with
state grant-making entities on certain topics related to grants;
revising provisions governing the State Plan for Maximizing
Federal Assistance; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 [With certain exceptions, this bill enacts requirements governing payments by agencies of
2 the Executive Department of the State Government to private nonprofit corporations that
3 receive grants from those agencies and are reimbursed by those agencies for services or other
4 performance under a grant agreement. Section 3 of this bill defines the term “grant” to
5 establish the types of financial assistance to which these requirements apply. Section 8 of this
6 bill declares that it is the policy of this State to: (1) complete all processing and authorization
7 required by law to make a payment, as defined in section 4 of this bill, within 30 calendar
8 days after receipt of a proper invoice, as defined in section 6 of this bill; and (2) make an
9 advance of a grant to a private nonprofit corporation to facilitate the expeditious carrying out

Assembly Amendment No. 861 to Assembly Bill No. 442 First Reprint Page 4
10 of the grant. Section 8.5 of this bill requires the State Board of Examiners to adopt policies
11 and procedures to carry out the provisions of this bill, which are required under existing law to
12 be published in the State Administrative Manual. (NRS 232.004) Section 8.5 mandates that
13 such policies and procedures include a requirement that a summary of the provisions relating
14 to prompt payments and advance payments be included in each grant agreement with a private
15 nonprofit corporation.]
16 Section 9 of this bill [provides that, with certain exceptions,] requires a state entity that
17 makes a grant to a private nonprofit corporation, which is defined in section 7 of this bill as a
18 “state grant-making entity,” [is liable for interest on amounts which are due and payable under
19 a written grant agreement at the rate that has been agreed upon in the grant agreement, or if no
20 such rate has been agreed upon, by a specified rate. Section 9 provides that, with certain
21 exceptions, interest begins accruing on the 31st calendar day after the date on which the state
22 grant-making entity receives a proper invoice and requires interest to be paid from the
23 operating budget of the state grant-making entity, not including money appropriated to fund a
24 grant. Section 9 also requires a state grant-making entity] that does not make a payment that is
25 due and payable under a written grant agreement within 30 calendar days after receipt of a
26 proper invoice to: (1) provide written notice to the private nonprofit corporation of the reason
27 for the delay in making the payment; and (2) [make a written record of the delayed payment
28 and] submit an annual compilation of such records to the Director of the Office of Finance [.]
29 and the Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau for transmittal to the Interim
30 Finance Committee. Sections 2-6 of this bill define certain terms relating to these
31 requirements.
32 [Section 10 of this bill requires a state grant-making entity to mark an invoice with the
33 date on which the invoice was received and review the invoice as soon as practicable to
34 determine whether the invoice is a proper invoice. Section 10 authorizes a state grant-making
35 entity to use media that produce tangible recordings of information to expedite payment in
36 lieu of requiring original paper documents.
37 Section 11 of this bill authorizes a private nonprofit corporation to submit to a state grant-
38 making entity a request for an advance of money from the grant that was awarded to the
39 private nonprofit corporation by the state grant-making entity. Section 11 requires the private
40 nonprofit corporation to: (1) submit an expenditure plan with its request for an advance and
41 any other information requested by the state grant-making entity; and (2) agree to
42 requirements relating to reporting expenditures, returning unexpended money, depositing the
43 advance and reporting related interest. Section 11, with certain exceptions, authorizes the state
44 grant-making entity to approve the advance if it makes specific determinations and
45 verifications. With certain exceptions, section 11 limits the amount of such an advance to be:
46 (1) if the source of funding for the grant is state money, the amount requested by the private
47 nonprofit corporation, but not to exceed 25 percent of the amount of the grant award; or (2) if
48 the source of the grant is federal money, the minimum amount to cover the immediate cash
49 requirements of the private nonprofit corporation in carrying out the purpose of the grant.
50 Section 11 prohibits a state grant-making entity from making an advance if the entity does not
51 have sufficient budgetary authority or a sufficient cash balance to pay the advance.
52 Section 11 requires: (1) the state grant-making entity to provide written notice of the
53 approval of any advance to the Director of the Office of Finance; and (2) the Director to
54 submit an annual report to the Interim Finance Committee relating to advance payments of
55 which the Director was notified.]
56 Existing law requires the Director of the Office of Federal Assistance, in
57 consultation with the Nevada Advisory Council on Federal Assistance, to develop a State
58 Plan for Maximizing Federal Assistance which is required to include, without limitation,
59 methods for the effective administration of grants. (NRS 223.486) Section 11.7 of this bill
60 requires the State Plan to include methods for the administration of advanced payments
61 of grants to private nonprofit corporations.
62 Section 11.3 of this bill authorizes the Office to coordinate and collaborate with state
63 grant-making entities to identify certain policies, procedures and best practices that are
64 related to the advanced payment of a grant and methods for compliance with certain
65 federal regulations relating to grants. Section 11.3 authorizes the Director to adopt
66 regulations to carry out such coordination and collaboration. Section 11.5 of this bill
67 applies the definitions in existing law governing the Office to the provisions of section
68 11.3.

Assembly Amendment No. 861 to Assembly Bill No. 442 First Reprint Page 5
69 Section 14 of this bill makes this bill effective on July 1, 2026, and section 13 of this bill
70 excludes from the requirements of this bill grants which are executed, renewed or extended
71 before July 1, 2026.
