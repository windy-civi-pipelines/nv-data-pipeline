ASSEMBLY JOINT RESOLUTION—Urging Congress to enact
the Protecting the Right to Organize Act.
1 WHEREAS, An imbalance of earning power exists in the United
2 States economy, where annual income for the bottom 90 percent of
3 U.S. workers increased by 44 percent between 1979 and 2023, while
4 income for the top 1 percent of U.S. workers increased by over 180
5 percent during that period; and
6 WHEREAS, Unions play a critical role in increasing wages for
7 workers and reducing income inequality and, according to a 2023
8 report published by the Economic Policy Institute, workers covered
9 by a union contract earn 13.5 percent more on average than
10 similarly situated workers who are not covered by a union contract;
11 and
12 WHEREAS, Polls reveal that public support for unions has surged
13 in recent years, with approval for unions at some of the highest
14 levels since the 1960s; and
15 WHEREAS, On March 5, 2025, the Richard L. Trumka
16 Protecting the Right to Organize Act of 2025 was introduced in the
17 United States Congress as H.R. 20, 119th Cong. (2025), to increase
18 protections relating to the rights of employees to collectively
19 bargain; and
20 WHEREAS, This comprehensive legislation would prevent
21 employers from misclassifying employees so as to exempt those
22 employees from existing protections under labor laws; and

– 2 –
1 WHEREAS, The Act would allow a collective bargaining
2 agreement to require the collection of fair share fees by unions to
3 cover the cost of representing all represented workers; and
4 WHEREAS, The Act would also prohibit employers from
5 permanently replacing or discriminating against workers who
6 participate in strikes; and
7 WHEREAS, The Act would additionally prevent employers from
8 requiring workers to attend mandatory meetings designed to
9 discourage them from joining a union; now, therefore, be it
10 RESOLVED BY THE ASSEMBLY AND SENATE OF THE STATE OF
11 NEVADA, JOINTLY, That the members of the 83rd Session of the
12 Nevada Legislature respectfully urge the Congress of the United
13 States to enact the Richard L. Trumka Protecting the Right to
14 Organize Act of 2025 to increase protections relating to the rights of
15 employees to collectively bargain; and be it further
16 RESOLVED, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly prepare and
17 transmit a copy of this resolution to the President of the United
18 States, the Vice President of the United States as presiding officer of
