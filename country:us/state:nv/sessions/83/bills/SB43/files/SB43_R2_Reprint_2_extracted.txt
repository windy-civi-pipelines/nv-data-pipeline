Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth provisions governing the collection and disposal of solid
2 waste. (NRS 444.440-444.645) For the purposes of such provisions, existing law
3 defines a “solid waste management authority” to mean: (1) the district board of
4 health in any area in which a health district has been created and, under certain
5 circumstances, certain other areas under the jurisdiction of the board, if the board
6 has adopted certain regulations; and (2) the Division of Environmental Protection
7 of the State Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, in all other areas
8 of the State and at any site previously used for the production of electricity from a
9 coal-fired electric generating plant. (NRS 444.495) Section 4 of this bill authorizes
10 the Administrator of the Division to designate a district board of health to act as a
11 solid waste management authority or to carry out limited duties of a solid waste
12 management authority if the district board of health: (1) applies to the
13 Administrator for such a designation; (2) demonstrates that the district board of
14 health is capable of carrying out the provisions of existing law relating to solid
15 waste management, as determined by the Administrator; and (3) has adopted
16 certain regulations relating to solid waste management.
17 Section 13.5 of this bill requires the State Environmental Commission to adopt
18 regulations establishing the criteria for a district board of health to demonstrate
19 capability to be designated by the Administrator.
20 Section 34 of this bill provides that any district board of health that is currently
21 acting as a solid waste management authority shall be deemed to have been
22 determined capable by the Administrator and may continue to act as a solid waste
23 management authority.
24 Section 7 of this bill revises the definition of “solid waste management
25 authority” to mean: (1) a district board of health if the board is designated under
26 section 4; and (2) the Division, in all other areas of the State and at any site
27 previously used for the production of electricity from a coal-fired electric
28 generating plant. As a result of this change, a district board of health that is not
29 designated by the Administrator is not authorized to act as a solid waste
30 management authority.
31 Consistent with these changes, sections 8, 13 and 16 of this bill provide that
32 only a designated district board of health of a health district is required to adopt
33 certain regulations relating to the collection and disposal of solid waste. Sections
34 8.5, 9, 14, 18 and 19 of this bill make conforming changes to reflect the divestment
35 of the authority of a district board of health of a health district that is not designated
36 to act as a solid waste management authority.
37 Existing law authorizes any district board of health and any governing body of
38 a municipality to adopt certain standards and regulations relating to solid waste
39 disposal sites and solid waste management systems that are more restrictive than
40 those adopted by the Commission and authorizes the district board of health to
41 issue permits thereunder. Existing law also authorizes any district board of health to
42 adopt such other regulations as are necessary to carry out provisions relating to the
43 collection and disposal of solid waste. (NRS 444.580) Section 15 of this bill
44 provides that certain standards and regulations adopted by a district board of health
45 or governing body must be consistent with an approved plan to provide for a solid
46 waste management system. Section 15 also provides that if a district board of
47 health adopts regulations other than standards and regulations for the location,
48 design, construction, operation and maintenance of a solid waste management
49 system or solid waste disposal system that are more restrictive than those adopted
50 by the Commission, the district board of health must provide reasonable
51 notification of the proposed regulations to the Division.
52 Section 2 of this bill defines “health district” for the purposes of existing law
53 governing the collection and disposal of solid waste. Section 10 of this bill makes
54 conforming changes to a reference to this term.

*SB43_R2*
– 3 –
55 Section 3 of this bill defines the “Resource Conservation and Recovery Act”
56 and, consistent with this definition, sections 6, 11-13 and 16 of this bill revise
57 references to that Act in existing law governing the collection and disposal of solid
58 waste.
59 Section 5 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law and sections 2 and
60 3 to the provisions of existing law and section 4 that govern the collection and
61 disposal of solid waste.
62 Sections 17 and 18 of this bill make provisions of existing law establishing the
63 powers of a solid waste management authority to enforce existing law, recover civil
64 penalties or damages, obtain injunctive relief or issue subpoenas apply to the
65 provisions of sections 2-4.
66 Existing law sets forth certain provisions governing public water systems and
67 authorizes the Division and a district board of health to administer and enforce
68 these provisions. (NRS 445A.800-445A.955) Existing law also authorizes the State
69 Environmental Commission to designate a district board of health to issue permits
70 to an owner of a public water system to operate the system. (NRS 445A.860,
71 445A.885) Section 20 of this bill authorizes the Administrator of the Division to
72 designate the district board of health of the health district to issue permits or
73 administer and enforce the provisions or limited provisions governing public water
74 systems if the district board of health: (1) applies for such a designation; and (2)
75 demonstrates to the Administrator that the district board is capable of performing
76 such actions. Section 23 of this bill requires the Commission to adopt regulations
77 establishing the criteria for a district board of health to demonstrate capability to be
78 designated by the Administrator.
79 Section 34 provides that any district board of health that is currently
80 administering and enforcing the provisions governing public water systems shall be
81 deemed to have been designated by the Administrator and may continue to
82 administer and enforce those provisions.
83 Consistent with these changes, sections 23 and 24-28 of this bill limit the
84 authority of a district board of health to issue permits or administer and enforce the
85 provisions governing public water systems to only a district board of health
86 designated by the Administrator.
87 Section 22 of this bill revises the definition of the term “district board of
88 health” to clarify that a health district is created pursuant to certain provisions of
89 existing law. Section 21 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law governing
90 public water systems to section 20.
91 Sections 29-33 of this bill make certain provisions of existing law governing
92 the enforcement powers of the Division, the imposition of civil penalties,
93 administrative fines and criminal penalties and obtaining injunctive relief apply to
94 section 20.
95 Section 23.5 of this bill makes a conforming change to revise an internal
96 reference to a provision of the Nevada Revised Statutes.
97 Existing law defines the term “public swimming pool” for the purposes of
98 provisions governing the sanitation of such structures and provides that the term
99 does not include any such structure at any location if the structure is a privately
100 owned pool used by members of a private club or invited guests of the members.
101 (NRS 444.065) Section 4.5 of this bill instead provides that the term does not
102 include any such structure at any location if the structure is a privately owned pool
103 used by members of a private organization that is recognized as a social club
104 exempt from taxation pursuant to certain provisions of the Internal Revenue Code
105 or invited guests of members of such an organization.

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth provisions governing the collection and disposal of solid
2 waste. (NRS 444.440-444.645) For the purposes of such provisions, existing law
3 defines a “solid waste management authority” to mean: (1) the district board of
4 health in any area in which a health district has been created and, under certain
5 circumstances, certain other areas under the jurisdiction of the board, if the board
6 has adopted certain regulations; and (2) the Division of Environmental Protection
7 of the State Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, in all other areas
8 of the State and at any site previously used for the production of electricity from a
9 coal-fired electric generating plant. (NRS 444.495) Section 4 of this bill authorizes
10 the Administrator of the Division to designate a district board of health to act as a
11 solid waste management authority or to carry out limited duties of a solid waste
12 management authority if the district board of health: (1) applies to the
13 Administrator for such a designation; (2) demonstrates that the district board of
14 health is capable of carrying out the provisions of existing law relating to solid
15 waste management, as determined by the Administrator; and (3) has adopted
16 certain regulations relating to solid waste management.
17 Section 13.5 of this bill requires the State Environmental Commission to adopt
18 regulations establishing the criteria for a district board of health to demonstrate
19 capability to be designated by the Administrator.
20 Section 34 of this bill provides that any district board of health that is currently
21 acting as a solid waste management authority shall be deemed to have been
22 determined capable by the Administrator and may continue to act as a solid waste
23 management authority.
24 Section 7 of this bill revises the definition of “solid waste management
25 authority” to mean: (1) a district board of health if the board is designated under
26 section 4; and (2) the Division, in all other areas of the State and at any site
27 previously used for the production of electricity from a coal-fired electric
28 generating plant. As a result of this change, a district board of health that is not
29 designated by the Administrator is not authorized to act as a solid waste
30 management authority.
31 Consistent with these changes, sections 8, 13 and 16 of this bill provide that
32 only a designated district board of health of a health district is required to adopt
33 certain regulations relating to the collection and disposal of solid waste. Sections
34 8.5, 9, 14, 18 and 19 of this bill make conforming changes to reflect the divestment
35 of the authority of a district board of health of a health district that is not designated
36 to act as a solid waste management authority.
37 Existing law authorizes any district board of health and any governing body of
38 a municipality to adopt certain standards and regulations relating to solid waste
39 disposal sites and solid waste management systems that are more restrictive than
40 those adopted by the Commission and authorizes the district board of health to
41 issue permits thereunder. Existing law also authorizes any district board of health to
42 adopt such other regulations as are necessary to carry out provisions relating to the
43 collection and disposal of solid waste. (NRS 444.580) Section 15 of this bill
44 provides that certain standards and regulations adopted by a district board of health
45 or governing body must be consistent with an approved plan to provide for a solid
46 waste management system. Section 15 also provides that if a district board of
47 health adopts regulations other than standards and regulations for the location,
48 design, construction, operation and maintenance of a solid waste management
49 system or solid waste disposal system that are more restrictive than those adopted
50 by the Commission, the district board of health must provide reasonable
51 notification of the proposed regulations to the Division.
52 Section 2 of this bill defines “health district” for the purposes of existing law
53 governing the collection and disposal of solid waste. Section 10 of this bill makes
54 conforming changes to a reference to this term.
-
*SB43_R2*

– 3 –
55 Section 3 of this bill defines the “Resource Conservation and Recovery Act”
56 and, consistent with this definition, sections 6, 11-13 and 16 of this bill revise
57 references to that Act in existing law governing the collection and disposal of solid
58 waste.
59 Section 5 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law and sections 2 and
60 3 to the provisions of existing law and section 4 that govern the collection and
61 disposal of solid waste.
62 Sections 17 and 18 of this bill make provisions of existing law establishing the
63 powers of a solid waste management authority to enforce existing law, recover civil
64 penalties or damages, obtain injunctive relief or issue subpoenas apply to the
65 provisions of sections 2-4.
66 Existing law sets forth certain provisions governing public water systems and
67 authorizes the Division and a district board of health to administer and enforce
68 these provisions. (NRS 445A.800-445A.955) Existing law also authorizes the State
69 Environmental Commission to designate a district board of health to issue permits
70 to an owner of a public water system to operate the system. (NRS 445A.860,
71 445A.885) Section 20 of this bill authorizes the Administrator of the Division to
72 designate the district board of health of the health district to issue permits or
73 administer and enforce the provisions or limited provisions governing public water
74 systems if the district board of health: (1) applies for such a designation; and (2)
75 demonstrates to the Administrator that the district board is capable of performing
76 such actions. Section 23 of this bill requires the Commission to adopt regulations
77 establishing the criteria for a district board of health to demonstrate capability to be
78 designated by the Administrator.
79 Section 34 provides that any district board of health that is currently
80 administering and enforcing the provisions governing public water systems shall be
81 deemed to have been designated by the Administrator and may continue to
82 administer and enforce those provisions.
83 Consistent with these changes, sections 23 and 24-28 of this bill limit the
84 authority of a district board of health to issue permits or administer and enforce the
85 provisions governing public water systems to only a district board of health
86 designated by the Administrator.
87 Section 22 of this bill revises the definition of the term “district board of
88 health” to clarify that a health district is created pursuant to certain provisions of
89 existing law. Section 21 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law governing
90 public water systems to section 20.
91 Sections 29-33 of this bill make certain provisions of existing law governing
92 the enforcement powers of the Division, the imposition of civil penalties,
93 administrative fines and criminal penalties and obtaining injunctive relief apply to
94 section 20.
95 Section 23.5 of this bill makes a conforming change to revise an internal
96 reference to a provision of the Nevada Revised Statutes.
97 Existing law defines the term “public swimming pool” for the purposes of
98 provisions governing the sanitation of such structures and provides that the term
99 does not include any such structure at any location if the structure is a privately
100 owned pool used by members of a private club or invited guests of the members.
101 (NRS 444.065) Section 4.5 of this bill instead provides that the term does not
102 include any such structure at any location if the structure is a privately owned pool
103 used by members of a private organization that is recognized as a social club
104 exempt from taxation pursuant to certain provisions of the Internal Revenue Code
105 or invited guests of members of such an organization.
