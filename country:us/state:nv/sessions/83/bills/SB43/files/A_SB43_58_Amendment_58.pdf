AN ACT relating to environmental protection; authorizing certain district boards of
health to be designated to act as a solid waste management authority
or exercise certain powers of a solid waste management authority
under certain circumstances; removing the authority of certain district
boards of health to administer the collection and disposal of solid
waste; requiring the State Environmental Commission to adopt
regulations establishing certain criteria for a district board of
health to demonstrate capability for certain purposes; authorizing
certain district boards of health to issue certain permits and administer
and enforce certain provisions relating to public water systems under
certain circumstances; removing the authority of certain district boards
of health to administer certain provisions relating to public water
systems; providing a penalty; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth provisions governing the collection and disposal of solid waste.
2 (NRS 444.440-444.645) For the purposes of such provisions, existing law defines a “solid
3 waste management authority” to mean: (1) the district board of health in any area in which a
4 health district has been created and, under certain circumstances, certain other areas under the
5 jurisdiction of the board, if the board has adopted certain regulations; and (2) the Division of
6 Environmental Protection of the State Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, in
7 all other areas of the State and at any site previously used for the production of electricity
8 from a coal-fired electric generating plant. (NRS 444.495) Section 4 of this bill [provides that
9 in any area in which a health district includes a county whose population is 100,000 or more

Senate Amendment No. 58 to Senate Bill No. 43 Page 4
10 (currently Clark and Washoe Counties) and in any area in which the district board of health of
11 the health district has authority pursuant to an interlocal agreement,] authorizes the
12 Administrator of the Division to designate a district board of health [may] to act as a solid
13 waste management authority or to carry out limited duties of a solid waste management
14 authority if the district board of health: (1) applies to the Administrator for such a
15 designation; (2) demonstrates that the district board of health is capable of carrying out
16 the provisions of existing law relating to solid waste management, as determined by the
17 Administrator ; [of the Division;] and [(2)] (3) has adopted certain regulations relating to solid
18 waste management.
19 Section 13.5 of this bill requires the State Environmental Commission to adopt
20 regulations establishing the criteria for a district board of health to demonstrate
21 capability to be designated by the Administrator.
22 Section 34 of this bill provides that any district board of health that is currently acting as
23 a solid waste management authority shall be deemed to have been determined capable by the
24 Administrator and may continue to act as a solid waste management authority.
25 Section 7 of this bill revises the definition of “solid waste management authority” to
26 mean: (1) a district board of health if the board [meets the requirements of] is designated
27 under section 4; and (2) the Division, in all other areas of the State and at any site previously
28 used for the production of electricity from a coal-fired electric generating plant. As a result of
29 this change, a district board of health [in an area in which a health district does not include a
30 county whose population is 100,000 or more] that is not designated by the Administrator is
31 not authorized to act as a solid waste management authority.
32 Consistent with these changes, sections 8, 13 [, 15] and 16 of this bill provide that only a
33 designated district board of health of a health district [that includes a county whose
34 population is 100,000 or more] is required to adopt certain regulations relating to the
35 collection and disposal of solid waste. Sections 8.5, 9, [10,] 14, 18 and 19 of this bill make
36 conforming changes to reflect the divestment of the authority of a district board of health of a
37 health district that [does not include a county whose population is 100,000 or more] is not
38 designated to act as a solid waste management authority.
39 Existing law authorizes any district board of health and any governing body of a
40 municipality to adopt certain standards and regulations relating to solid waste disposal sites
41 and solid waste management systems that are more restrictive than those adopted by the
42 Commission and authorizes the district board of health to issue permits thereunder. Existing
43 law also authorizes any district board of health to adopt such other regulations as are
44 necessary to carry out provisions relating to the collection and disposal of solid waste.
45 (NRS 444.580) Section 15 [limits this authorization to only] of this bill provides that certain
46 standards and regulations adopted by a district [boards] board of health [and] or
47 governing [bodies in an area with a health district that includes a county whose population is
48 100,000 or more.
49 Existing law requires the governing] body [of every municipality or district board of
50 health to develop a plan to provide for a solid waste management system. (NRS 444.510)
51 Section 10 requires that only a district board of health that includes a county whose population
52 is 100,000 or more develop such a] must be consistent with an approved plan [.] to provide
53 for a solid waste management system. Section 15 also provides that if a district board of
54 health adopts regulations other than standards and regulations for the location, design,
55 construction, operation and maintenance of a solid waste management system or solid
56 waste disposal system that are more restrictive than those adopted by the Commission,
57 the district board of health must provide reasonable notification of the proposed
58 regulations to the Division.
59 Section 2 of this bill defines “health district” for the purposes of existing law governing
60 the collection and disposal of solid waste. Section 10 of this bill makes conforming changes
61 to a reference to this term.
62 Section 3 of this bill defines the “Resource Conservation and Recovery Act” and,
63 consistent with this definition, sections 6, [11-14] 11-13 and 16 of this bill revise references
64 to that Act in existing law governing the collection and disposal of solid waste.
65 Section 5 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law and sections 2 and 3 to the
66 provisions of existing law and section 4 that govern the collection and disposal of solid waste.

Senate Amendment No. 58 to Senate Bill No. 43 Page 5
67 Sections 17 and 18 of this bill make provisions of existing law establishing the powers of
68 a solid waste management authority to enforce existing law, recover civil penalties or
69 damages, obtain injunctive relief or issue subpoenas apply to the provisions of sections 2-4.
70 Existing law sets forth certain provisions governing public water systems and authorizes
71 the Division and a district board of health to administer and enforce these provisions. (NRS
72 445A.800-445A.955) Existing law also authorizes the State Environmental Commission to
73 designate a district board of health to issue permits to an owner of a public water system to
74 operate the system. (NRS 445A.860, 445A.885) Section 20 of this bill authorizes the
75 Administrator of the Division to [, in any area in which a health district includes a county
76 whose population is 100,000 or more,] designate the district board of health of the health
77 district to issue permits or administer and enforce the provisions or limited provisions
78 governing public water systems if the district board of health : (1) applies for such a
79 designation; and (2) demonstrates to the Administrator that the district board is capable of
80 performing such actions. Section 23 of this bill requires the Commission to adopt
81 regulations establishing the criteria for a district board of health to demonstrate
82 capability to be designated by the Administrator.
83 Section 34 provides that any district board of health that is currently administering and
84 enforcing the provisions governing public water systems shall be deemed to have been
85 designated by the Administrator and may continue to administer and enforce those provisions.
86 Consistent with [this change,] these changes, sections [23-28] 23 and 24-28 of this bill
87 limit the authority of a district board of health to issue permits or administer and enforce the
88 provisions governing public water systems to only a district board of health designated by the
89 Administrator.
90 Section 22 of this bill revises the definition of the term “district board of health” to
91 clarify that a health district is created pursuant to certain provisions of existing law. Section
92 21 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law governing public water systems to section
93 20.
94 Sections 29-33 of this bill make certain provisions of existing law governing the
95 enforcement powers of the Division, the imposition of civil penalties, administrative fines and
96 criminal penalties and obtaining injunctive relief apply to section 20.
97 Section 23.5 of this bill makes a conforming change to revise an internal reference to
98 a provision of the Nevada Revised Statutes.
