Health and Human Services
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to public health; authorizing certain district boards
of health to be designated to act as a solid waste management
authority or exercise certain powers of a solid waste
management authority under certain circumstances; revising
provisions relating to public swimming pools; removing the
authority of certain district boards of health to administer the
collection and disposal of solid waste; requiring the State
Environmental Commission to adopt regulations establishing
certain criteria for a district board of health to demonstrate
capability for certain purposes; authorizing certain district
boards of health to issue certain permits and administer and
enforce certain provisions relating to public water systems
under certain circumstances; removing the authority of
certain district boards of health to administer certain

penalty; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law sets forth provisions governing the collection and disposal of solid
waste. (NRS 444.440-444.645) For the purposes of such provisions, existing law
defines a “solid waste management authority” to mean: (1) the district board of
health in any area in which a health district has been created and, under certain
circumstances, certain other areas under the jurisdiction of the board, if the board
has adopted certain regulations; and (2) the Division of Environmental Protection
of the State Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, in all other areas
of the State and at any site previously used for the production of electricity from a
coal-fired electric generating plant. (NRS 444.495) Section 4 of this bill authorizes
the Administrator of the Division to designate a district board of health to act as a
solid waste management authority or to carry out limited duties of a solid waste
management authority if the district board of health: (1) applies to the
Administrator for such a designation; (2) demonstrates that the district board of
health is capable of carrying out the provisions of existing law relating to solid
waste management, as determined by the Administrator; and (3) has adopted
certain regulations relating to solid waste management.
Section 13.5 of this bill requires the State Environmental Commission to adopt
regulations establishing the criteria for a district board of health to demonstrate
capability to be designated by the Administrator.
Section 34 of this bill provides that any district board of health that is currently
acting as a solid waste management authority shall be deemed to have been
determined capable by the Administrator and may continue to act as a solid waste
management authority.
Section 7 of this bill revises the definition of “solid waste management
authority” to mean: (1) a district board of health if the board is designated under
section 4; and (2) the Division, in all other areas of the State and at any site
previously used for the production of electricity from a coal-fired electric
generating plant. As a result of this change, a district board of health that is not
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 2 –
designated by the Administrator is not authorized to act as a solid waste
management authority.
Consistent with these changes, sections 8, 13 and 16 of this bill provide that
only a designated district board of health of a health district is required to adopt
certain regulations relating to the collection and disposal of solid waste. Sections
8.5, 9, 14, 18 and 19 of this bill make conforming changes to reflect the divestment
of the authority of a district board of health of a health district that is not designated
to act as a solid waste management authority.
Existing law authorizes any district board of health and any governing body of
a municipality to adopt certain standards and regulations relating to solid waste
disposal sites and solid waste management systems that are more restrictive than
those adopted by the Commission and authorizes the district board of health to
issue permits thereunder. Existing law also authorizes any district board of health to
adopt such other regulations as are necessary to carry out provisions relating to the
collection and disposal of solid waste. (NRS 444.580) Section 15 of this bill
provides that certain standards and regulations adopted by a district board of health
or governing body must be consistent with an approved plan to provide for a solid
waste management system. Section 15 also provides that if a district board of
health adopts regulations other than standards and regulations for the location,
design, construction, operation and maintenance of a solid waste management
system or solid waste disposal system that are more restrictive than those adopted
by the Commission, the district board of health must provide reasonable
notification of the proposed regulations to the Division.
Section 2 of this bill defines “health district” for the purposes of existing law
governing the collection and disposal of solid waste. Section 10 of this bill makes
conforming changes to a reference to this term.
Section 3 of this bill defines the “Resource Conservation and Recovery Act”
and, consistent with this definition, sections 6, 11-13 and 16 of this bill revise
references to that Act in existing law governing the collection and disposal of solid
waste.
Section 5 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law and sections 2 and
3 to the provisions of existing law and section 4 that govern the collection and
disposal of solid waste.
Sections 17 and 18 of this bill make provisions of existing law establishing the
powers of a solid waste management authority to enforce existing law, recover civil
penalties or damages, obtain injunctive relief or issue subpoenas apply to the
provisions of sections 2-4.
Existing law sets forth certain provisions governing public water systems and
authorizes the Division and a district board of health to administer and enforce
these provisions. (NRS 445A.800-445A.955) Existing law also authorizes the State
Environmental Commission to designate a district board of health to issue permits
to an owner of a public water system to operate the system. (NRS 445A.860,
445A.885) Section 20 of this bill authorizes the Administrator of the Division to
designate the district board of health of the health district to issue permits or
administer and enforce the provisions or limited provisions governing public water
systems if the district board of health: (1) applies for such a designation; and (2)
demonstrates to the Administrator that the district board is capable of performing
such actions. Section 23 of this bill requires the Commission to adopt regulations
establishing the criteria for a district board of health to demonstrate capability to be
designated by the Administrator.
Section 34 provides that any district board of health that is currently
administering and enforcing the provisions governing public water systems shall be
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 3 –
deemed to have been designated by the Administrator and may continue to
administer and enforce those provisions.
Consistent with these changes, sections 23 and 24-28 of this bill limit the
authority of a district board of health to issue permits or administer and enforce the
provisions governing public water systems to only a district board of health
designated by the Administrator.
Section 22 of this bill revises the definition of the term “district board of
health” to clarify that a health district is created pursuant to certain provisions of
existing law. Section 21 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law governing
public water systems to section 20.
Sections 29-33 of this bill make certain provisions of existing law governing
the enforcement powers of the Division, the imposition of civil penalties,
administrative fines and criminal penalties and obtaining injunctive relief apply to
section 20.
Section 23.5 of this bill makes a conforming change to revise an internal
reference to a provision of the Nevada Revised Statutes.
Existing law defines the term “public swimming pool” for the purposes of
provisions governing the sanitation of such structures and provides that the term
does not include any such structure at any location if the structure is a privately
owned pool used by members of a private club or invited guests of the members.
(NRS 444.065) Section 4.5 of this bill instead provides that the term does not
include any such structure at any location if the structure is a privately owned pool
used by members of a private organization that is recognized as a social club
exempt from taxation pursuant to certain provisions of the Internal Revenue Code
or invited guests of members of such an organization.
