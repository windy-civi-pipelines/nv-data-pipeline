AN ACT relating to environmental protection; authorizing certain
district boards of health to act as a solid waste
management authority under certain circumstances;
removing the authority of certain district boards of health
to administer the collection and disposal of solid waste;
authorizing certain district boards of health to issue
certain permits and administer and enforce certain
provisions relating to public water systems under certain
circumstances; removing the authority of certain district
boards of health to administer certain provisions relating
to public water systems; providing a penalty; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth provisions governing the collection and disposal of solid
2 waste. (NRS 444.440-444.645) For the purposes of such provisions, existing law
3 defines a “solid waste management authority” to mean: (1) the district board of
4 health in any area in which a health district has been created and, under certain
5 circumstances, certain other areas under the jurisdiction of the board, if the board
6 has adopted certain regulations; and (2) the Division of Environmental Protection
7 of the State Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, in all other areas
-
*SB43*
– 2 –
8 of the State and at any site previously used for the production of electricity from a
9 coal-fired electric generating plant. (NRS 444.495) Section 4 of this bill provides
10 that in any area in which a health district includes a county whose population is
11 100,000 or more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties) and in any area in which
12 the district board of health of the health district has authority pursuant to an
13 interlocal agreement, the district board of health may act as a solid waste
14 management authority if the district board of health: (1) is capable of carrying out
15 the provisions of existing law relating to solid waste management, as determined by
16 the Administrator of the Division; and (2) has adopted certain regulations relating
17 to solid waste management.
18 Section 34 of this bill provides that any district board of health that is currently
19 acting as a solid waste management authority shall be deemed to have been
20 determined capable by the Administrator and may continue to act as a solid waste
21 management authority.
22 Section 7 of this bill revises the definition of “solid waste management
23 authority” to mean: (1) a district board of health if the board meets the requirements
24 of section 4; and (2) the Division, in all other areas of the State and at any site
25 previously used for the production of electricity from a coal-fired electric
26 generating plant. As a result of this change, a district board of health in an area in
27 which a health district does not include a county whose population is 100,000 or
28 more is not authorized to act as a solid waste management authority.
29 Consistent with these changes, sections 8, 13, 15 and 16 of this bill provide
30 that only a district board of health of a health district that includes a county whose
31 population is 100,000 or more is required to adopt certain regulations relating to the
32 collection and disposal of solid waste. Sections 9, 10, 14, 18 and 19 of this bill
33 make conforming changes to reflect the divestment of the authority of a district
34 board of health of a health district that does not include a county whose population
35 is 100,000 or more to act as a solid waste management authority.
36 Existing law authorizes any district board of health and any governing body of
37 a municipality to adopt certain standards and regulations relating to solid waste
38 disposal sites and solid waste management systems and authorizes the district board
39 of health to issue permits thereunder. (NRS 444.580) Section 15 limits this
40 authorization to only district boards of health and governing bodies in an area with
41 a health district that includes a county whose population is 100,000 or more.
42 Existing law requires the governing body of every municipality or district board
43 of health to develop a plan to provide for a solid waste management system. (NRS
44 444.510) Section 10 requires that only a district board of health that includes a
45 county whose population is 100,000 or more develop such a plan.
46 Section 2 of this bill defines “health district” for the purposes of existing law
47 governing the collection and disposal of solid waste.
48 Section 3 of this bill defines the “Resource Conservation and Recovery Act”
49 and, consistent with this definition, sections 6, 11-14 and 16 of this bill revise
50 references to that Act in existing law governing the collection and disposal of solid
51 waste.
52 Section 5 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law and sections 2 and
53 3 to the provisions of existing law and section 4 that govern the collection and
54 disposal of solid waste.
55 Sections 17 and 18 of this bill make provisions of existing law establishing the
56 powers of a solid waste management authority to enforce existing law, recover civil
57 penalties or damages, obtain injunctive relief or issue subpoenas apply to the
58 provisions of sections 2-4.
59 Existing law sets forth certain provisions governing public water systems and
60 authorizes the Division and a district board of health to administer and enforce
61 these provisions. (NRS 445A.800-445A.955) Existing law also authorizes the State
62 Environmental Commission to designate a district board of health to issue permits
-
*SB43*
– 3 –
63 to an owner of a public water system to operate the system. (NRS 445A.860,
64 445A.885) Section 20 of this bill authorizes the Administrator of the Division to, in
65 any area in which a health district includes a county whose population is 100,000 or
66 more, designate the district board of health of the health district to issue permits or
67 administer and enforce the provisions governing public water systems if the district
68 board of health demonstrates to the Administrator that the district board is capable
69 of performing such actions.
70 Section 34 provides that any district board of health that is currently
71 administering and enforcing the provisions governing public water systems shall be
72 deemed to have been designated by the Administrator and may continue to
73 administer and enforce those provisions. Consistent with this change, sections 23-
74 28 of this bill limit the authority of a district board of health to issue permits or
75 administer and enforce the provisions governing public water systems to only a
76 district board of health designated by the Administrator.
77 Section 22 of this bill revises the definition of the term “district board of
78 health” to clarify that a health district is created pursuant to certain provisions of
79 existing law. Section 21 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law governing
80 public water systems to section 20.
81 Sections 29-33 of this bill make certain provisions of existing law governing
82 the enforcement powers of the Division, the imposition of civil penalties,
83 administrative fines and criminal penalties and obtaining injunctive relief apply to
84 section 20.

S.B. 43
SENATE BILL NO. 43–COMMITTEE ON
HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES
(ON BEHALF OF THE DIVISION OF ENVIRONMENTAL
PROTECTION OF THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF
CONSERVATION AND NATURAL RESOURCES)
PREFILED NOVEMBER 18, 2024
____________
Referred to Committee on Health and Human Services
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to environmental
protection. (BDR 40-264)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: Increases or Newly
Provides for Term of Imprisonment in County or City
Jail or Detention Facility.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to environmental protection; authorizing certain
district boards of health to act as a solid waste
management authority under certain circumstances;
removing the authority of certain district boards of health
to administer the collection and disposal of solid waste;
authorizing certain district boards of health to issue
certain permits and administer and enforce certain
provisions relating to public water systems under certain
circumstances; removing the authority of certain district
boards of health to administer certain provisions relating
to public water systems; providing a penalty; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth provisions governing the collection and disposal of solid
2 waste. (NRS 444.440-444.645) For the purposes of such provisions, existing law
3 defines a “solid waste management authority” to mean: (1) the district board of
4 health in any area in which a health district has been created and, under certain
5 circumstances, certain other areas under the jurisdiction of the board, if the board
6 has adopted certain regulations; and (2) the Division of Environmental Protection
7 of the State Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, in all other areas
-
*SB43*

– 2 –
8 of the State and at any site previously used for the production of electricity from a
9 coal-fired electric generating plant. (NRS 444.495) Section 4 of this bill provides
10 that in any area in which a health district includes a county whose population is
11 100,000 or more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties) and in any area in which
12 the district board of health of the health district has authority pursuant to an
13 interlocal agreement, the district board of health may act as a solid waste
14 management authority if the district board of health: (1) is capable of carrying out
15 the provisions of existing law relating to solid waste management, as determined by
16 the Administrator of the Division; and (2) has adopted certain regulations relating
17 to solid waste management.
18 Section 34 of this bill provides that any district board of health that is currently
19 acting as a solid waste management authority shall be deemed to have been
20 determined capable by the Administrator and may continue to act as a solid waste
21 management authority.
22 Section 7 of this bill revises the definition of “solid waste management
23 authority” to mean: (1) a district board of health if the board meets the requirements
24 of section 4; and (2) the Division, in all other areas of the State and at any site
25 previously used for the production of electricity from a coal-fired electric
26 generating plant. As a result of this change, a district board of health in an area in
27 which a health district does not include a county whose population is 100,000 or
28 more is not authorized to act as a solid waste management authority.
29 Consistent with these changes, sections 8, 13, 15 and 16 of this bill provide
30 that only a district board of health of a health district that includes a county whose
31 population is 100,000 or more is required to adopt certain regulations relating to the
32 collection and disposal of solid waste. Sections 9, 10, 14, 18 and 19 of this bill
33 make conforming changes to reflect the divestment of the authority of a district
34 board of health of a health district that does not include a county whose population
35 is 100,000 or more to act as a solid waste management authority.
36 Existing law authorizes any district board of health and any governing body of
37 a municipality to adopt certain standards and regulations relating to solid waste
38 disposal sites and solid waste management systems and authorizes the district board
39 of health to issue permits thereunder. (NRS 444.580) Section 15 limits this
40 authorization to only district boards of health and governing bodies in an area with
41 a health district that includes a county whose population is 100,000 or more.
42 Existing law requires the governing body of every municipality or district board
43 of health to develop a plan to provide for a solid waste management system. (NRS
44 444.510) Section 10 requires that only a district board of health that includes a
45 county whose population is 100,000 or more develop such a plan.
46 Section 2 of this bill defines “health district” for the purposes of existing law
47 governing the collection and disposal of solid waste.
48 Section 3 of this bill defines the “Resource Conservation and Recovery Act”
49 and, consistent with this definition, sections 6, 11-14 and 16 of this bill revise
50 references to that Act in existing law governing the collection and disposal of solid
51 waste.
52 Section 5 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law and sections 2 and
53 3 to the provisions of existing law and section 4 that govern the collection and
54 disposal of solid waste.
55 Sections 17 and 18 of this bill make provisions of existing law establishing the
56 powers of a solid waste management authority to enforce existing law, recover civil
57 penalties or damages, obtain injunctive relief or issue subpoenas apply to the
58 provisions of sections 2-4.
59 Existing law sets forth certain provisions governing public water systems and
60 authorizes the Division and a district board of health to administer and enforce
61 these provisions. (NRS 445A.800-445A.955) Existing law also authorizes the State
62 Environmental Commission to designate a district board of health to issue permits
-
*SB43*

– 3 –
63 to an owner of a public water system to operate the system. (NRS 445A.860,
64 445A.885) Section 20 of this bill authorizes the Administrator of the Division to, in
65 any area in which a health district includes a county whose population is 100,000 or
66 more, designate the district board of health of the health district to issue permits or
67 administer and enforce the provisions governing public water systems if the district
68 board of health demonstrates to the Administrator that the district board is capable
69 of performing such actions.
70 Section 34 provides that any district board of health that is currently
71 administering and enforcing the provisions governing public water systems shall be
72 deemed to have been designated by the Administrator and may continue to
73 administer and enforce those provisions. Consistent with this change, sections 23-
74 28 of this bill limit the authority of a district board of health to issue permits or
75 administer and enforce the provisions governing public water systems to only a
76 district board of health designated by the Administrator.
77 Section 22 of this bill revises the definition of the term “district board of
78 health” to clarify that a health district is created pursuant to certain provisions of
79 existing law. Section 21 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law governing
80 public water systems to section 20.
81 Sections 29-33 of this bill make certain provisions of existing law governing
82 the enforcement powers of the Division, the imposition of civil penalties,
83 administrative fines and criminal penalties and obtaining injunctive relief apply to
84 section 20.

13 health of the health district may act as a solid waste management
14 authority if the district board of health:
