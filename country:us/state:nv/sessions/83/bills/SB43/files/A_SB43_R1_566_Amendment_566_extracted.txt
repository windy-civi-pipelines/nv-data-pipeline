EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to [environmental protection;] public health; authorizing certain
district boards of health to be designated to act as a solid waste
management authority or exercise certain powers of a solid waste
management authority under certain circumstances; revising
provisions relating to public swimming pools; removing the
authority of certain district boards of health to administer the collection
and disposal of solid waste; requiring the State Environmental
Commission to adopt regulations establishing certain criteria for a
district board of health to demonstrate capability for certain purposes;
authorizing certain district boards of health to issue certain permits and
administer and enforce certain provisions relating to public water
systems under certain circumstances; removing the authority of certain
district boards of health to administer certain provisions relating to
public water systems; providing a penalty; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth provisions governing the collection and disposal of solid waste.
2 (NRS 444.440-444.645) For the purposes of such provisions, existing law defines a “solid
3 waste management authority” to mean: (1) the district board of health in any area in which a
4 health district has been created and, under certain circumstances, certain other areas under the
5 jurisdiction of the board, if the board has adopted certain regulations; and (2) the Division of
6 Environmental Protection of the State Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, in
7 all other areas of the State and at any site previously used for the production of electricity
Assembly Amendment No. 566 to Senate Bill No. 43 First Reprint Page 4
8 from a coal-fired electric generating plant. (NRS 444.495) Section 4 of this bill authorizes the
9 Administrator of the Division to designate a district board of health to act as a solid waste
10 management authority or to carry out limited duties of a solid waste management authority if
11 the district board of health: (1) applies to the Administrator for such a designation; (2)
12 demonstrates that the district board of health is capable of carrying out the provisions of
13 existing law relating to solid waste management, as determined by the Administrator; and (3)
14 has adopted certain regulations relating to solid waste management.
15 Section 13.5 of this bill requires the State Environmental Commission to adopt
16 regulations establishing the criteria for a district board of health to demonstrate capability to
17 be designated by the Administrator.
18 Section 34 of this bill provides that any district board of health that is currently acting as
19 a solid waste management authority shall be deemed to have been determined capable by the
20 Administrator and may continue to act as a solid waste management authority.
21 Section 7 of this bill revises the definition of “solid waste management authority” to
22 mean: (1) a district board of health if the board is designated under section 4; and (2) the
23 Division, in all other areas of the State and at any site previously used for the production of
24 electricity from a coal-fired electric generating plant. As a result of this change, a district
25 board of health that is not designated by the Administrator is not authorized to act as a solid
26 waste management authority.
27 Consistent with these changes, sections 8, 13 and 16 of this bill provide that only a
28 designated district board of health of a health district is required to adopt certain regulations
29 relating to the collection and disposal of solid waste. Sections 8.5, 9, 14, 18 and 19 of this bill
30 make conforming changes to reflect the divestment of the authority of a district board of
31 health of a health district that is not designated to act as a solid waste management authority.
32 Existing law authorizes any district board of health and any governing body of a
33 municipality to adopt certain standards and regulations relating to solid waste disposal sites
34 and solid waste management systems that are more restrictive than those adopted by the
35 Commission and authorizes the district board of health to issue permits thereunder. Existing
36 law also authorizes any district board of health to adopt such other regulations as are
37 necessary to carry out provisions relating to the collection and disposal of solid waste. (NRS
38 444.580) Section 15 of this bill provides that certain standards and regulations adopted by a
39 district board of health or governing body must be consistent with an approved plan to provide
40 for a solid waste management system. Section 15 also provides that if a district board of
41 health adopts regulations other than standards and regulations for the location, design,
42 construction, operation and maintenance of a solid waste management system or solid waste
43 disposal system that are more restrictive than those adopted by the Commission, the district
44 board of health must provide reasonable notification of the proposed regulations to the
45 Division.
46 Section 2 of this bill defines “health district” for the purposes of existing law governing
47 the collection and disposal of solid waste. Section 10 of this bill makes conforming changes to
48 a reference to this term.
49 Section 3 of this bill defines the “Resource Conservation and Recovery Act” and,
50 consistent with this definition, sections 6, 11-13 and 16 of this bill revise references to that
51 Act in existing law governing the collection and disposal of solid waste.
52 Section 5 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law and sections 2 and 3 to the
53 provisions of existing law and section 4 that govern the collection and disposal of solid waste.
54 Sections 17 and 18 of this bill make provisions of existing law establishing the powers of
55 a solid waste management authority to enforce existing law, recover civil penalties or
56 damages, obtain injunctive relief or issue subpoenas apply to the provisions of sections 2-4.
57 Existing law sets forth certain provisions governing public water systems and authorizes
58 the Division and a district board of health to administer and enforce these provisions. (NRS
59 445A.800-445A.955) Existing law also authorizes the State Environmental Commission to
60 designate a district board of health to issue permits to an owner of a public water system to
61 operate the system. (NRS 445A.860, 445A.885) Section 20 of this bill authorizes the
62 Administrator of the Division to designate the district board of health of the health district to
63 issue permits or administer and enforce the provisions or limited provisions governing public
64 water systems if the district board of health: (1) applies for such a designation; and (2)
65 demonstrates to the Administrator that the district board is capable of performing such actions.
Assembly Amendment No. 566 to Senate Bill No. 43 First Reprint Page 5
66 Section 23 of this bill requires the Commission to adopt regulations establishing the criteria
67 for a district board of health to demonstrate capability to be designated by the Administrator.
68 Section 34 provides that any district board of health that is currently administering and
69 enforcing the provisions governing public water systems shall be deemed to have been
70 designated by the Administrator and may continue to administer and enforce those provisions.
71 Consistent with these changes, sections 23 and 24-28 of this bill limit the authority of a
72 district board of health to issue permits or administer and enforce the provisions governing
73 public water systems to only a district board of health designated by the Administrator.
74 Section 22 of this bill revises the definition of the term “district board of health” to
75 clarify that a health district is created pursuant to certain provisions of existing law. Section
76 21 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law governing public water systems to section
77 20.
78 Sections 29-33 of this bill make certain provisions of existing law governing the
79 enforcement powers of the Division, the imposition of civil penalties, administrative fines and
80 criminal penalties and obtaining injunctive relief apply to section 20.
81 Section 23.5 of this bill makes a conforming change to revise an internal reference to a
82 provision of the Nevada Revised Statutes.
83 Existing law defines the term “public swimming pool” for the purposes of provisions
84 governing the sanitation of such structures and provides that the term does not include
85 any such structure at any location if the structure is a privately owned pool used by
86 members of a private club or invited guests of the members. (NRS 444.065) Section 4.5 of
87 this bill instead provides that the term does not include any such structure at any
88 location if the structure is a privately owned pool used by members of a private
89 organization that is recognized as a social club exempt from taxation pursuant to certain
90 provisions of the Internal Revenue Code or invited guests of members of such an
91 organization.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

1 2. If the Administrator designates a district board of health pursuant to
2 subsection 1, the Division of Environmental Protection shall periodically review
3 the activities of the district board of health to evaluate the continued capability of
4 the district board of health to carry out the provisions or limited provisions of

10 provide written notice of a deficiency by certified mail to the district board of
11 health of this determination. If the deficiency identified in the written notice:
12 (a) Does not present an imminent or substantial hazard to public health,
13 safety or the environment, as determined by the Administrator, the written notice
14 must set forth a date by which the district board of health must correct the
15 deficiency, which must be not less than 60 days after the date the notice was

30 is not subject to additional review.

5 impracticable.
6 Sec. 10. NRS 444.510 is hereby amended to read as follows:
7 444.510 1. The governing body of every municipality or district board of

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth provisions governing the collection and disposal of solid waste.
2 (NRS 444.440-444.645) For the purposes of such provisions, existing law defines a “solid
3 waste management authority” to mean: (1) the district board of health in any area in which a
4 health district has been created and, under certain circumstances, certain other areas under the
5 jurisdiction of the board, if the board has adopted certain regulations; and (2) the Division of
6 Environmental Protection of the State Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, in
7 all other areas of the State and at any site previously used for the production of electricity

Assembly Amendment No. 566 to Senate Bill No. 43 First Reprint Page 4
8 from a coal-fired electric generating plant. (NRS 444.495) Section 4 of this bill authorizes the
9 Administrator of the Division to designate a district board of health to act as a solid waste
10 management authority or to carry out limited duties of a solid waste management authority if
11 the district board of health: (1) applies to the Administrator for such a designation; (2)
12 demonstrates that the district board of health is capable of carrying out the provisions of
13 existing law relating to solid waste management, as determined by the Administrator; and (3)
14 has adopted certain regulations relating to solid waste management.
15 Section 13.5 of this bill requires the State Environmental Commission to adopt
16 regulations establishing the criteria for a district board of health to demonstrate capability to
17 be designated by the Administrator.
18 Section 34 of this bill provides that any district board of health that is currently acting as
19 a solid waste management authority shall be deemed to have been determined capable by the
20 Administrator and may continue to act as a solid waste management authority.
21 Section 7 of this bill revises the definition of “solid waste management authority” to
22 mean: (1) a district board of health if the board is designated under section 4; and (2) the
23 Division, in all other areas of the State and at any site previously used for the production of
24 electricity from a coal-fired electric generating plant. As a result of this change, a district
25 board of health that is not designated by the Administrator is not authorized to act as a solid
26 waste management authority.
27 Consistent with these changes, sections 8, 13 and 16 of this bill provide that only a
28 designated district board of health of a health district is required to adopt certain regulations
29 relating to the collection and disposal of solid waste. Sections 8.5, 9, 14, 18 and 19 of this bill
30 make conforming changes to reflect the divestment of the authority of a district board of
31 health of a health district that is not designated to act as a solid waste management authority.
32 Existing law authorizes any district board of health and any governing body of a
33 municipality to adopt certain standards and regulations relating to solid waste disposal sites
34 and solid waste management systems that are more restrictive than those adopted by the
35 Commission and authorizes the district board of health to issue permits thereunder. Existing
36 law also authorizes any district board of health to adopt such other regulations as are
37 necessary to carry out provisions relating to the collection and disposal of solid waste. (NRS
38 444.580) Section 15 of this bill provides that certain standards and regulations adopted by a
39 district board of health or governing body must be consistent with an approved plan to provide
40 for a solid waste management system. Section 15 also provides that if a district board of
41 health adopts regulations other than standards and regulations for the location, design,
42 construction, operation and maintenance of a solid waste management system or solid waste
43 disposal system that are more restrictive than those adopted by the Commission, the district
44 board of health must provide reasonable notification of the proposed regulations to the
45 Division.
46 Section 2 of this bill defines “health district” for the purposes of existing law governing
47 the collection and disposal of solid waste. Section 10 of this bill makes conforming changes to
48 a reference to this term.
49 Section 3 of this bill defines the “Resource Conservation and Recovery Act” and,
50 consistent with this definition, sections 6, 11-13 and 16 of this bill revise references to that
51 Act in existing law governing the collection and disposal of solid waste.
52 Section 5 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law and sections 2 and 3 to the
53 provisions of existing law and section 4 that govern the collection and disposal of solid waste.
54 Sections 17 and 18 of this bill make provisions of existing law establishing the powers of
55 a solid waste management authority to enforce existing law, recover civil penalties or
56 damages, obtain injunctive relief or issue subpoenas apply to the provisions of sections 2-4.
57 Existing law sets forth certain provisions governing public water systems and authorizes
58 the Division and a district board of health to administer and enforce these provisions. (NRS
59 445A.800-445A.955) Existing law also authorizes the State Environmental Commission to
60 designate a district board of health to issue permits to an owner of a public water system to
61 operate the system. (NRS 445A.860, 445A.885) Section 20 of this bill authorizes the
62 Administrator of the Division to designate the district board of health of the health district to
63 issue permits or administer and enforce the provisions or limited provisions governing public
64 water systems if the district board of health: (1) applies for such a designation; and (2)
65 demonstrates to the Administrator that the district board is capable of performing such actions.

Assembly Amendment No. 566 to Senate Bill No. 43 First Reprint Page 5
66 Section 23 of this bill requires the Commission to adopt regulations establishing the criteria
67 for a district board of health to demonstrate capability to be designated by the Administrator.
68 Section 34 provides that any district board of health that is currently administering and
69 enforcing the provisions governing public water systems shall be deemed to have been
70 designated by the Administrator and may continue to administer and enforce those provisions.
71 Consistent with these changes, sections 23 and 24-28 of this bill limit the authority of a
72 district board of health to issue permits or administer and enforce the provisions governing
73 public water systems to only a district board of health designated by the Administrator.
74 Section 22 of this bill revises the definition of the term “district board of health” to
75 clarify that a health district is created pursuant to certain provisions of existing law. Section
76 21 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law governing public water systems to section
77 20.
78 Sections 29-33 of this bill make certain provisions of existing law governing the
79 enforcement powers of the Division, the imposition of civil penalties, administrative fines and
80 criminal penalties and obtaining injunctive relief apply to section 20.
81 Section 23.5 of this bill makes a conforming change to revise an internal reference to a
82 provision of the Nevada Revised Statutes.
83 Existing law defines the term “public swimming pool” for the purposes of provisions
84 governing the sanitation of such structures and provides that the term does not include
85 any such structure at any location if the structure is a privately owned pool used by
86 members of a private club or invited guests of the members. (NRS 444.065) Section 4.5 of
87 this bill instead provides that the term does not include any such structure at any
88 location if the structure is a privately owned pool used by members of a private
89 organization that is recognized as a social club exempt from taxation pursuant to certain
90 provisions of the Internal Revenue Code or invited guests of members of such an
91 organization.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN

10 provide written notice of a deficiency by certified mail to the district board of
11 health of this determination. If the deficiency identified in the written notice:
12 (a) Does not present an imminent or substantial hazard to public health,
13 safety or the environment, as determined by the Administrator, the written notice
14 must set forth a date by which the district board of health must correct the
