AN ACT relating to collective bargaining; requiring, with certain
exceptions, each school district to semiannually provide
each employee organization recognized by the school
district certain information relating to each employee of
the bargaining unit represented by the employee
organization; requiring collective bargaining between the
Executive Department of State Government and classified
employees to include matters relating to parking and
transportation; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires each employee organization recognized by a local
2 government employer, including, without limitation, a school district, in this State
3 to file a report with the Government Employee-Management Relations Board each
4 year containing certain information, including, without limitation, the total number
5 of persons in each bargaining unit represented by the employee organization. (NRS
6 288.165) Section 1 of this bill requires, with certain exception, that each school
7 district provide each employee organization recognized by the school district the
8 name, address, electronic mail address, telephone number, work contact
9 information and work location of each employee in the bargaining unit represented
10 by the employee organization at least on a semiannual basis, unless the school
11 district and an employee organization recognized by the school district agree
12 otherwise. Section 1 further provides that if a school district employee notifies his
13 or her employer in writing that he or she does not want the employer to provide his

14 or her information to the employee organization, the school district must not
15 provide the information to the employee organization but must still provide the
16 information to the Government Employee-Management Relations Board when
17 requested by order of the Board. Section 1 also provides that information about any
18 school district employee provided to an employee organization or the Board is
19 confidential and is not a public record. Section 3 of this bill makes a conforming
20 change relating to making such information confidential and not a public record.
21 Existing law sets forth the requirements for collective bargaining between the
22 Executive Department of State Government and employee organizations that
23 represent classified employees, including the subjects of mandatory bargaining.
24 (NRS 288.500) Section 2.5 of this bill additionally requires such collective
25 bargaining to include matters relating to parking and transportation.
26 Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to indicate the proper
27 placement of section 1 in the Nevada Revised Statutes.

16 entity must be open at all times during office hours to inspection by
17 any person, and may be fully copied or an abstract or memorandum
18 may be prepared from those public books and public records. Any
19 such copies, abstracts or memoranda may be used to supply the
20 general public with copies, abstracts or memoranda of the records or
21 may be used in any other way to the advantage of the governmental
22 entity or of the general public. This section does not supersede or in
23 any manner affect the federal laws governing copyrights or enlarge,
24 diminish or affect in any other manner the rights of a person in any
25 written book or record which is copyrighted pursuant to federal law.
26 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record

28 3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a
29 public book or record shall not deny a request made pursuant to
30 subsection 1 to inspect or copy or receive a copy of a public book or
31 record on the basis that the requested public book or record contains
32 information that is confidential if the governmental entity can

35 included in the public book or record that is not otherwise
36 confidential.
37 4. If requested, a governmental entity shall provide a copy of a
38 public record in an electronic format by means of an electronic

SUMMARY—Revises provisions governing collective bargaining
for certain public employees. (BDR 23-700)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to collective bargaining; requiring, with certain
exceptions, each school district to semiannually provide
each employee organization recognized by the school
district certain information relating to each employee of
the bargaining unit represented by the employee
organization; requiring collective bargaining between the
Executive Department of State Government and classified
employees to include matters relating to parking and
transportation; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires each employee organization recognized by a local
2 government employer, including, without limitation, a school district, in this State
3 to file a report with the Government Employee-Management Relations Board each
4 year containing certain information, including, without limitation, the total number
5 of persons in each bargaining unit represented by the employee organization. (NRS
6 288.165) Section 1 of this bill requires, with certain exception, that each school
7 district provide each employee organization recognized by the school district the
8 name, address, electronic mail address, telephone number, work contact
9 information and work location of each employee in the bargaining unit represented
10 by the employee organization at least on a semiannual basis, unless the school
11 district and an employee organization recognized by the school district agree
12 otherwise. Section 1 further provides that if a school district employee notifies his
13 or her employer in writing that he or she does not want the employer to provide his

14 or her information to the employee organization, the school district must not
15 provide the information to the employee organization but must still provide the
16 information to the Government Employee-Management Relations Board when
17 requested by order of the Board. Section 1 also provides that information about any
18 school district employee provided to an employee organization or the Board is
19 confidential and is not a public record. Section 3 of this bill makes a conforming
20 change relating to making such information confidential and not a public record.
21 Existing law sets forth the requirements for collective bargaining between the
22 Executive Department of State Government and employee organizations that
23 represent classified employees, including the subjects of mandatory bargaining.
24 (NRS 288.500) Section 2.5 of this bill additionally requires such collective
25 bargaining to include matters relating to parking and transportation.
26 Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to indicate the proper
27 placement of section 1 in the Nevada Revised Statutes.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 288 of NRS is hereby amended by adding

5 July 1, each school district shall provide each employee
6 organization recognized by the school district the name, address,
7 electronic mail address, telephone number, work contact
8 information and work location of each school district employee of
9 the bargaining unit represented by the employee organization. A
10 school district and an employee organization may agree to provide
11 such information about school district employees at other times
12 that are in addition to or in place of January 1 and July 1 of each
13 year.
14 2. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3, a school
15 district is required to provide an employee organization with the
16 information about a school district employee pursuant to
17 subsection 1 regardless of whether the employee has joined the
18 employee organization.
19 3. If a school district employee notifies the school district in
20 writing that he or she does not want the school district to provide
21 any of his or her information to the employee organization
22 recognized by the school district, the school district:
23 (a) Must not provide the information set forth in subsection 1
24 to the employee organization; and
25 (b) Must still provide the information set forth in subsection 1
26 to the Government Employee-Management Relations Board when

3 Sec. 2. NRS 288.131 is hereby amended to read as follows:
4 288.131 As used in NRS 288.131 to 288.280, inclusive, and

8 Sec. 2.5. NRS 288.500 is hereby amended to read as follows:
9 288.500 1. For the purposes of collective bargaining,
10 supplemental bargaining and other mutual aid or protection,
11 employees have the right to:
12 (a) Organize, form, join and assist labor organizations, engage in
13 collective bargaining and supplemental bargaining through
14 exclusive representatives and engage in other concerted activities;
15 and
16 (b) Refrain from engaging in such activity.
17 2. Collective bargaining and supplemental bargaining entail a
18 mutual obligation of the Executive Department and an exclusive
19 representative to meet at reasonable times and to bargain in good
20 faith with respect to:
21 (a) The subjects of mandatory bargaining set forth in subsection
22 2 of NRS 288.150, except paragraph (f) of that subsection;

33 agreement negotiated pursuant to the provisions of NRS 288.400 to

39 288.400 to 288.630, inclusive, do not require, the Executive
40 Department to negotiate subject matters set forth in subsection 3
41 which are outside the scope of mandatory bargaining. The Executive
42 Department shall discuss subject matters outside the scope of
43 mandatory bargaining but it is not required to negotiate those
44 matters.

10 Board before October 1, 2019, relating to the interpretation of, or
