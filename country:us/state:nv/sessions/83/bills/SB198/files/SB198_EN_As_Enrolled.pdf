Senate Bill No. 198–Senator Daly
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to employment; revising provisions governing the
payment of wages and compensation to an employee who
resigns, quits or is discharged or placed on nonworking
status; revising the penalty imposed upon an employer for the
failure to pay such wages when due; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Under existing law, whenever an employer: (1) discharges an employee, the
wages and compensation earned and unpaid at the time of the discharge become
due and payable immediately; and (2) places an employee on nonworking status,
the wages earned and unpaid at the time the employee is placed on such status
become due and payable immediately. (NRS 608.020) Additionally, existing law
provides that whenever an employee resigns or quits his or her employment, the
wages and compensation earned and unpaid at the time of the employee’s
resignation or quitting are required to be paid not later than the day on which the
employee would have regularly been paid the wages or compensation or 7 days
after the employee resigns or quits, whichever is earlier. (NRS 608.030) Sections 1
and 2 of this bill revise those requirements with respect to compensation to instead
provide that any compensation of such an employee that is earned and unpaid at the
time the employee is discharged, resigns or quits is required to be paid in the same
manner and on the same day on which the employee would have regularly been
paid the compensation. Sections 1-3 of this bill define “compensation” to mean any
bonus, arrangement to share profits, fringe benefits, matching contribution made to
a plan authorized by 26 U.S.C. § 401(k) and any other similar contribution that an
employer has agreed to pay to an employee.
Existing law provides for the imposition of a penalty upon an employer who
fails to comply with the requirements pertaining to the payment of wages and
compensation of an employee who resigned, quit or was discharged or placed on
nonworking status. Under existing law, the wages or compensation of such an
employee continues at the same rate until the employee is paid or for 30 days,
whichever is less, if the employer fails to pay the wages or compensation, as
applicable: (1) for an employee who is discharged, within 3 days after the wages or
compensation of the employee becomes due; (2) for an employee who is placed on
nonworking status, within 3 days after the wages of the employee becomes due;
and (3) for an employee who resigns or quits, on the day the wages or
compensation is due. (NRS 608.040)
Section 3 revises the amount of such a penalty. Rather than providing that the
wages or compensation of the employee continues at the same rate until paid or for
30 days, whichever is less, section 3 requires an employer who fails to pay the
wages of an employee who has resigned, quit or been discharged or placed on
nonworking status within the required time to pay the employee an additional
amount equal to the amount the employee would receive for 8 hours of work at the
rate of 1 1/2 times his or her hourly wage rate for each day or portion of a day that
the wages to which the employee is entitled and any additional amount required by
section 3 are not paid or for 30 days, whichever is less.
Section 3 additionally requires such an employer to pay to an employee who
has resigned, quit or been discharged an amount equal to the amount of
compensation the employee would have earned for each day or portion of a day that

the wages to which the employee is entitled and any additional amount required by
section 3 are not paid or for 30 days, whichever is less. Section 3 requires that
amount to be paid in the same manner and on the same day on which the employee
would have regularly been paid compensation if the employee had earned
compensation during that period.
