~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to labor; revising provisions governing the
payment of wages and compensation to an employee who
resigns, quits or is discharged or placed on nonworking
status; revising the penalty imposed upon an employer for
the failure to pay such wages and compensation when
due; requiring the revocation of the license of a cannabis
establishment that violates a federal or state labor law;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, whenever an employer: (1) discharges an employee, the
2 wages and compensation earned and unpaid at the time of the discharge become
3 due and payable immediately; and (2) places an employee on nonworking status,
4 the wages earned and unpaid at the time the employee is placed on such status
5 become due and payable immediately. (NRS 608.020) Additionally, existing law
6 provides that whenever an employee resigns or quits his or her employment, the
7 wages and compensation earned and unpaid at the time of the employee’s
8 resignation or quitting are required to be paid not later than the day on which the
9 employee would have regularly been paid the wages or compensation or 7 days
10 after the employee resigns or quits, whichever is earlier. (NRS 608.030) Sections 1
11 and 2 of this bill provide that for the purposes of those requirements, compensation
12 includes, without limitation, fringe benefits.
13 Existing law provides for the imposition of a penalty upon an employer who
14 fails to comply with the requirements pertaining to the payment of wages and
15 compensation of an employee who resigned, quit or was discharged or placed on
16 nonworking status. Under existing law, the wages or compensation of such an
17 employee continues at the same rate until the employee is paid or for 30 days,
18 whichever is less, if the employer fails to pay the wages or compensation, as
19 applicable: (1) for an employee who is discharged, within 3 days after the wages or
20 compensation of the employee becomes due; (2) for an employee who is placed on
21 nonworking status, within 3 days after the wages of the employee becomes due;
-

– 2 –
22 and (3) for an employee who resigns or quits, on the day the wages or
23 compensation is due. (NRS 608.040)
24 Section 3 of this bill revises the amount of such a penalty and the
25 circumstances under which such a penalty is imposed. Rather than providing for the
26 imposition of the penalty if an employer fails to pay the wages or compensation of
27 an employee who is discharged or the wages of an employee who is placed on
28 nonworking status within 3 days after the wages or compensation becomes due,
29 section 3 provides for the imposition of the penalty if the employer fails to pay the
30 wages or compensation of such an employee not later than 5 p.m. on the calendar
31 day immediately following the day on which the wages or compensation becomes
32 due. Rather than providing that the wages or compensation of the employee
33 continues at the same rate until paid or for 30 days, whichever is less, section 3
34 requires an employer who fails to pay the wages or compensation of an employee
35 who has resigned, quit or been discharged or placed on nonworking status within
36 the required time to pay the employee an additional amount equal to the amount the
37 employee would receive for 8 hours of work at the rate of 1 1/2 times his or her
38 hourly wage rate for each day or portion of a day that the wages or compensation to
39 which the employee is entitled and any additional amount required by section 3, are
40 not paid or for 30 days, whichever is less.
41 Existing law sets forth procedures by which the Cannabis Compliance Board
42 may take disciplinary action against a licensee or registrant who violates a
43 provision of existing law governing the cannabis industry in this State or any
44 regulation adopted by the Board. (NRS 678A.500-678A.647) Existing law sets
45 forth various disciplinary actions the Board is authorized to take against a licensee
46 or registrant if the Board finds that the licensee or registrant committed such a
47 violation. (NRS 678A.600) Additionally, existing law authorizes the Board to
48 resolve any matter concerning a licensee or registrant who has allegedly committed
49 such a violation by entering into a consent or settlement agreement with the
50 licensee or registrant. (NRS 678A.645)
51 Section 7 of this bill requires a cannabis establishment to comply with all
52 federal and state labor laws. Sections 4 and 6 of this bill prohibit the Board from
53 entering into a consent or settlement agreement with a licensee who has allegedly
54 violated that requirement. Instead, section 5 of this bill requires the Board, if the
55 Board finds that a licensee has violated that requirement, to revoke the license of
56 the licensee.
