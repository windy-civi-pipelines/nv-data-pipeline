EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to employment; revising provisions governing the
payment of wages and compensation to an employee who
resigns, quits or is discharged or placed on nonworking
status; revising the penalty imposed upon an employer for
the failure to pay such wages when due; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, whenever an employer: (1) discharges an employee, the
2 wages and compensation earned and unpaid at the time of the discharge become
3 due and payable immediately; and (2) places an employee on nonworking status,
4 the wages earned and unpaid at the time the employee is placed on such status
5 become due and payable immediately. (NRS 608.020) Additionally, existing law
6 provides that whenever an employee resigns or quits his or her employment, the
7 wages and compensation earned and unpaid at the time of the employee’s
8 resignation or quitting are required to be paid not later than the day on which the
9 employee would have regularly been paid the wages or compensation or 7 days
10 after the employee resigns or quits, whichever is earlier. (NRS 608.030) Sections 1
11 and 2 of this bill revise those requirements with respect to compensation to instead
12 provide that any compensation of such an employee that is earned and unpaid at the
13 time the employee is discharged, resigns or quits is required to be paid in the same
14 manner and on the same day on which the employee would have regularly been
15 paid the compensation. Sections 1-3 of this bill define “compensation” to mean any
16 bonus, arrangement to share profits, fringe benefits, matching contribution made to
17 a plan authorized by 26 U.S.C. § 401(k) and any other similar contribution that an
18 employer has agreed to pay to an employee.
19 Existing law provides for the imposition of a penalty upon an employer who
20 fails to comply with the requirements pertaining to the payment of wages and
21 compensation of an employee who resigned, quit or was discharged or placed on
22 nonworking status. Under existing law, the wages or compensation of such an

23 employee continues at the same rate until the employee is paid or for 30 days,
24 whichever is less, if the employer fails to pay the wages or compensation, as
25 applicable: (1) for an employee who is discharged, within 3 days after the wages or
26 compensation of the employee becomes due; (2) for an employee who is placed on
27 nonworking status, within 3 days after the wages of the employee becomes due;
28 and (3) for an employee who resigns or quits, on the day the wages or
29 compensation is due. (NRS 608.040)
30 Section 3 revises the amount of such a penalty. Rather than providing that the
31 wages or compensation of the employee continues at the same rate until paid or for
32 30 days, whichever is less, section 3 requires an employer who fails to pay the
33 wages of an employee who has resigned, quit or been discharged or placed on
34 nonworking status within the required time to pay the employee an additional
35 amount equal to the amount the employee would receive for 8 hours of work at the
36 rate of 1 1/2 times his or her hourly wage rate for each day or portion of a day that
37 the wages to which the employee is entitled and any additional amount required by
38 section 3, are not paid or for 30 days, whichever is less.
39 Section 3 additionally requires such an employer to pay to an employee who
40 has resigned, quit or been discharged an amount equal to the amount of
41 compensation the employee would have earned for each day or portion of a day that
42 the wages to which the employee is entitled and any additional amount required by
43 section 3 are not paid or for 30 days, whichever is less. Section 3 requires that
44 amount to be paid in the same manner and on the same day on which the employee
45 would have regularly been paid compensation if the employee had earned
46 compensation during that period.
