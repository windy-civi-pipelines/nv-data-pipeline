SUMMARY—Revises [provisions] requirements relating to [labor.] payment of
wages and compensation to certain employees. (BDR 53-557)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to [labor;] employment; revising provisions governing the
payment of wages and compensation to an employee who resigns, quits
or is discharged or placed on nonworking status; revising the penalty
imposed upon an employer for the failure to pay such wages [and
compensation] when due; [requiring the revocation of the license of a
cannabis establishment that violates a federal or state labor law;] and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, whenever an employer: (1) discharges an employee, the wages and
2 compensation earned and unpaid at the time of the discharge become due and payable
3 immediately; and (2) places an employee on nonworking status, the wages earned and unpaid
4 at the time the employee is placed on such status become due and payable immediately. (NRS
5 608.020) Additionally, existing law provides that whenever an employee resigns or quits his
6 or her employment, the wages and compensation earned and unpaid at the time of the
7 employee’s resignation or quitting are required to be paid not later than the day on which the
8 employee would have regularly been paid the wages or compensation or 7 days after the
9 employee resigns or quits, whichever is earlier. (NRS 608.030) Sections 1 and 2 of this bill
10 revise those requirements with respect to compensation to instead provide that [for the
11 purposes of those requirements, compensation includes, without limitation, fringe benefits.]
12 any compensation of such an employee that is earned and unpaid at the time the
13 employee is discharged, resigns or quits is required to be paid in the same manner and
14 on the same day on which the employee would have regularly been paid the
15 compensation. Sections 1-3 of this bill define “compensation” to mean any bonus,
16 arrangement to share profits, fringe benefits, matching contribution made to a plan
17 authorized by 26 U.S.C. § 401(k) and any other similar contribution that an employer
18 has agreed to pay to an employee.
19 Existing law provides for the imposition of a penalty upon an employer who fails to
20 comply with the requirements pertaining to the payment of wages and compensation of an
21 employee who resigned, quit or was discharged or placed on nonworking status. Under
22 existing law, the wages or compensation of such an employee continues at the same rate until
23 the employee is paid or for 30 days, whichever is less, if the employer fails to pay the wages
24 or compensation, as applicable: (1) for an employee who is discharged, within 3 days after the
25 wages or compensation of the employee becomes due; (2) for an employee who is placed on
Senate Amendment No. 303 to Senate Bill No. 198 Page 4
26 nonworking status, within 3 days after the wages of the employee becomes due; and (3) for an
27 employee who resigns or quits, on the day the wages or compensation is due. (NRS 608.040)
28 Section 3 [of this bill] revises the amount of such a penalty . [and the circumstances
29 under which such a penalty is imposed. Rather than providing for the imposition of the
30 penalty if an employer fails to pay the wages or compensation of an employee who is
31 discharged or the wages of an employee who is placed on nonworking status within 3 days
32 after the wages or compensation becomes due, section 3 provides for the imposition of the
33 penalty if the employer fails to pay the wages or compensation of such an employee not later
34 than 5 p.m. on the calendar day immediately following the day on which the wages or
35 compensation becomes due.] Rather than providing that the wages or compensation of the
36 employee continues at the same rate until paid or for 30 days, whichever is less, section 3
37 requires an employer who fails to pay the wages [or compensation] of an employee who has
38 resigned, quit or been discharged or placed on nonworking status within the required time to
39 pay the employee an additional amount equal to the amount the employee would receive for 8
40 hours of work at the rate of 1 1/2 times his or her hourly wage rate for each day or portion of a
41 day that the wages [or compensation] to which the employee is entitled and any additional
42 amount required by section 3, are not paid or for 30 days, whichever is less.
43 [Existing law sets forth procedures by which the Cannabis Compliance Board may take
44 disciplinary action against a licensee or registrant who violates a provision of existing law
45 governing the cannabis industry in this State or any regulation adopted by the Board. (NRS
46 678A.500-678A.647) Existing law sets forth various disciplinary actions the Board is
47 authorized to take against a licensee or registrant if the Board finds that the licensee or
48 registrant committed such a violation. (NRS 678A.600) Additionally, existing law authorizes
49 the Board to resolve any matter concerning a licensee or registrant who has allegedly
50 committed such a violation by entering into a consent or settlement agreement with the
51 licensee or registrant. (NRS 678A.645)
52 Section 7 of this bill requires a cannabis establishment to comply with all federal and
53 state labor laws. Sections 4 and 6 of this bill prohibit the Board from entering into a consent or
54 settlement agreement with a licensee who has allegedly violated that requirement. Instead,
55 section 5 of this bill requires the Board, if the Board finds that a licensee has violated that
56 requirement, to revoke the license of the licensee.] Section 3 additionally requires such an
57 employer to pay to an employee who has resigned, quit or been discharged an amount
58 equal to the amount of compensation the employee would have earned for each day or
59 portion of a day that the wages to which the employee is entitled and any additional
60 amount required by section 3 are not paid or for 30 days, whichever is less. Section 3
61 requires that amount to be paid in the same manner and on the same day on which the
62 employee would have regularly been paid compensation if the employee had earned
63 compensation during that period.

SUMMARY—Revises [provisions] requirements relating to [labor.] payment of
wages and compensation to certain employees. (BDR 53-557)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to [labor;] employment; revising provisions governing the
payment of wages and compensation to an employee who resigns, quits
or is discharged or placed on nonworking status; revising the penalty
imposed upon an employer for the failure to pay such wages [and
compensation] when due; [requiring the revocation of the license of a
cannabis establishment that violates a federal or state labor law;] and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, whenever an employer: (1) discharges an employee, the wages and
2 compensation earned and unpaid at the time of the discharge become due and payable
3 immediately; and (2) places an employee on nonworking status, the wages earned and unpaid
4 at the time the employee is placed on such status become due and payable immediately. (NRS
5 608.020) Additionally, existing law provides that whenever an employee resigns or quits his
6 or her employment, the wages and compensation earned and unpaid at the time of the
7 employee’s resignation or quitting are required to be paid not later than the day on which the
8 employee would have regularly been paid the wages or compensation or 7 days after the
9 employee resigns or quits, whichever is earlier. (NRS 608.030) Sections 1 and 2 of this bill
10 revise those requirements with respect to compensation to instead provide that [for the
11 purposes of those requirements, compensation includes, without limitation, fringe benefits.]
12 any compensation of such an employee that is earned and unpaid at the time the
13 employee is discharged, resigns or quits is required to be paid in the same manner and
14 on the same day on which the employee would have regularly been paid the
15 compensation. Sections 1-3 of this bill define “compensation” to mean any bonus,
16 arrangement to share profits, fringe benefits, matching contribution made to a plan
17 authorized by 26 U.S.C. § 401(k) and any other similar contribution that an employer
18 has agreed to pay to an employee.
19 Existing law provides for the imposition of a penalty upon an employer who fails to
20 comply with the requirements pertaining to the payment of wages and compensation of an
21 employee who resigned, quit or was discharged or placed on nonworking status. Under
22 existing law, the wages or compensation of such an employee continues at the same rate until
23 the employee is paid or for 30 days, whichever is less, if the employer fails to pay the wages
24 or compensation, as applicable: (1) for an employee who is discharged, within 3 days after the
25 wages or compensation of the employee becomes due; (2) for an employee who is placed on

26 nonworking status, within 3 days after the wages of the employee becomes due; and (3) for an
27 employee who resigns or quits, on the day the wages or compensation is due. (NRS 608.040)
28 Section 3 [of this bill] revises the amount of such a penalty . [and the circumstances
29 under which such a penalty is imposed. Rather than providing for the imposition of the
30 penalty if an employer fails to pay the wages or compensation of an employee who is
31 discharged or the wages of an employee who is placed on nonworking status within 3 days
32 after the wages or compensation becomes due, section 3 provides for the imposition of the
33 penalty if the employer fails to pay the wages or compensation of such an employee not later
34 than 5 p.m. on the calendar day immediately following the day on which the wages or
35 compensation becomes due.] Rather than providing that the wages or compensation of the
36 employee continues at the same rate until paid or for 30 days, whichever is less, section 3
37 requires an employer who fails to pay the wages [or compensation] of an employee who has
38 resigned, quit or been discharged or placed on nonworking status within the required time to
39 pay the employee an additional amount equal to the amount the employee would receive for 8
40 hours of work at the rate of 1 1/2 times his or her hourly wage rate for each day or portion of a
41 day that the wages [or compensation] to which the employee is entitled and any additional
42 amount required by section 3, are not paid or for 30 days, whichever is less.
43 [Existing law sets forth procedures by which the Cannabis Compliance Board may take
44 disciplinary action against a licensee or registrant who violates a provision of existing law
45 governing the cannabis industry in this State or any regulation adopted by the Board. (NRS
46 678A.500-678A.647) Existing law sets forth various disciplinary actions the Board is
47 authorized to take against a licensee or registrant if the Board finds that the licensee or
48 registrant committed such a violation. (NRS 678A.600) Additionally, existing law authorizes
49 the Board to resolve any matter concerning a licensee or registrant who has allegedly
50 committed such a violation by entering into a consent or settlement agreement with the
51 licensee or registrant. (NRS 678A.645)
52 Section 7 of this bill requires a cannabis establishment to comply with all federal and
53 state labor laws. Sections 4 and 6 of this bill prohibit the Board from entering into a consent or
54 settlement agreement with a licensee who has allegedly violated that requirement. Instead,
55 section 5 of this bill requires the Board, if the Board finds that a licensee has violated that
56 requirement, to revoke the license of the licensee.] Section 3 additionally requires such an
57 employer to pay to an employee who has resigned, quit or been discharged an amount
58 equal to the amount of compensation the employee would have earned for each day or
59 portion of a day that the wages to which the employee is entitled and any additional
60 amount required by section 3 are not paid or for 30 days, whichever is less. Section 3
61 requires that amount to be paid in the same manner and on the same day on which the
62 employee would have regularly been paid compensation if the employee had earned
63 compensation during that period.
