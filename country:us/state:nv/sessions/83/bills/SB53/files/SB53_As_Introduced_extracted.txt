EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to highways; requiring the Department of
Transportation to create an electronic system for local
governments to report road conditions under certain
circumstances; authorizing a city, county, regional
transportation commission, the Department or any other
public authority to notify a navigation provider regarding
certain road conditions; requiring a navigation provider to
take certain actions after receiving such a notification;
revising provisions relating to the Advisory Committee on
Traffic Safety; requiring the Director of the Department to

other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law regulates trade practices and other commercial activities in this
2 State. (Title 52 of NRS) Section 6 of this bill authorizes a city, county, regional
3 transportation commission, the Department of Transportation or any other public
4 authority to transmit a written or electronic notification to a navigation provider
5 concerning a current or anticipated road condition, such as a road closure, road
6 hazard, lane closure, construction project, accident or other road condition
7 impacting a highway under the jurisdiction of the entity providing the notification.
8 Section 6 requires a navigation provider who receives such a notification to
9 incorporate the road condition information contained within the notification into the
10 real-time data concerning traffic and road closures that is used by the navigation
11 provider to provide turn-by-turn directions to end users of its navigation application
12 within 48 hours after receiving the notification, with certain exceptions. If a
-

– 2 –
13 navigation provider fails to incorporate the road condition information into the real-
14 time data concerning traffic and road closures used to provide turn-by-turn
15 directions to end users within the time prescribed, section 6 provides for a civil
16 penalty of $500 to be imposed against the navigation provider for each day that the
17 navigation provider fails to incorporate the road condition information until: (1) the
18 provider incorporates the road condition information; or (2) the road condition
19 ceases to exist or is otherwise resolved. Additionally, section 6 authorizes a city,
20 county, regional transportation commission, the Department or any other public
21 authority, as a part of the notification sent to a navigation provider, to recommend a
22 specific route which would direct traffic around the specific road condition. A
23 navigation provider is not required to incorporate the recommended route into the
24 data used to provide turn-by-turn directions to end users.
25 Section 6 defines a “navigation provider” as a person who operates a
26 navigation application and defines a “navigation application” as an Internet
27 website, online service or mobile application which: (1) offers turn-by-turn
28 directions in real time to an end user; and (2) incorporates real-time data concerning
29 traffic and road closures into the direction and navigation services provided to the
30 end user. Section 6 excludes from the definition of “navigation application” a
31 service which: (1) has less than 10,000,000 active users per month; (2) does not
32 offer direction and navigation services for end users with respect to the highways in
33 this State; or (3) does not incorporate real-time data concerning traffic and road
34 closures into the direction and navigation services provided to an end user with
35 respect to the highways in this State.
36 Existing law creates the Department of Transportation and tasks the Director of
37 the Department with the general supervision of the construction, reconstruction,
38 improvement, maintenance and repair of all highways, facilities and services
39 authorized by the provisions governing highways, roads and transportation
40 facilities. (NRS 408.106, 408.195) The Director is also required to collect and
41 compile statistics and maps relating to the mileage, traffic, character and condition
42 of the highways. (NRS 408.190) Section 1 of this bill requires the Department to
43 create and maintain an electronic system which allows a qualified representative of
44 a city, county or regional transportation commission to submit to the Department
45 information relating to road conditions impacting certain highways under the
46 jurisdiction of the reporting entity for upload onto an Internet website or mobile
47 application maintained by the Department to communicate road conditions to the
48 public, including Nevada 511, if such a website or application is maintained by the
49 Department. Sections 2 and 4 of this bill require the Department to adopt
50 regulations and use funds in the Account for Systems of Providing Information to
51 the Traveling Public in the State Highway Fund, as necessary, to carry out the
52 provisions of section 1. Section 3 of this bill adds the provisions of section 1 to the
53 provisions of law which the Department, in cooperation with the Commission on
54 Tourism, is required to develop a plan to carry out.
55 Existing law creates the Advisory Committee on Traffic Safety within the
56 Department. The Advisory Committee consists of voting members and certain
57 nonvoting members who may be appointed by the Director of the Department.
58 (NRS 408.581) Section 5 of this bill requires the Director of the Department to
59 appoint to the Advisory Committee two nonvoting members who represent
60 navigation providers.

Referred to Committee on Growth and Infrastructure
SUMMARY—Establishes certain requirements relating to notices
of road hazards and road closures. (BDR 35-406)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to highways; requiring the Department of
Transportation to create an electronic system for local
governments to report road conditions under certain
circumstances; authorizing a city, county, regional
transportation commission, the Department or any other
public authority to notify a navigation provider regarding
certain road conditions; requiring a navigation provider to
take certain actions after receiving such a notification;
revising provisions relating to the Advisory Committee on
Traffic Safety; requiring the Director of the Department to
adopt regulations; providing a civil penalty; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law regulates trade practices and other commercial activities in this
2 State. (Title 52 of NRS) Section 6 of this bill authorizes a city, county, regional
3 transportation commission, the Department of Transportation or any other public
4 authority to transmit a written or electronic notification to a navigation provider
5 concerning a current or anticipated road condition, such as a road closure, road
6 hazard, lane closure, construction project, accident or other road condition
7 impacting a highway under the jurisdiction of the entity providing the notification.
8 Section 6 requires a navigation provider who receives such a notification to
9 incorporate the road condition information contained within the notification into the
10 real-time data concerning traffic and road closures that is used by the navigation
11 provider to provide turn-by-turn directions to end users of its navigation application
12 within 48 hours after receiving the notification, with certain exceptions. If a
-
*SB53*

– 2 –
13 navigation provider fails to incorporate the road condition information into the real-
14 time data concerning traffic and road closures used to provide turn-by-turn
15 directions to end users within the time prescribed, section 6 provides for a civil
16 penalty of $500 to be imposed against the navigation provider for each day that the
17 navigation provider fails to incorporate the road condition information until: (1) the
18 provider incorporates the road condition information; or (2) the road condition
19 ceases to exist or is otherwise resolved. Additionally, section 6 authorizes a city,
20 county, regional transportation commission, the Department or any other public
21 authority, as a part of the notification sent to a navigation provider, to recommend a
22 specific route which would direct traffic around the specific road condition. A
23 navigation provider is not required to incorporate the recommended route into the
24 data used to provide turn-by-turn directions to end users.
25 Section 6 defines a “navigation provider” as a person who operates a
26 navigation application and defines a “navigation application” as an Internet
27 website, online service or mobile application which: (1) offers turn-by-turn
