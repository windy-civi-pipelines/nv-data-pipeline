AN ACT relating to consumer protection; clarifying the authority of the Attorney
General with respect to bringing certain actions relating to deceptive
trade practices; revising certain civil penalties relating to deceptive
trade practices; revising the authorized uses of money in the Consumer
Protection Legal Account in the Office of the Attorney General;
clarifying when the Consumer’s Advocate of the Bureau of Consumer
Protection in the Office of the Attorney General has custody or control

the Consumer’s Advocate confidential; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law defines activities that constitute deceptive trade practices and provides for
2 the imposition of civil and criminal penalties against persons who engage in deceptive trade
3 practices. (Chapter 598 of NRS) Existing law authorizes the Attorney General to obtain a
4 temporary restraining order, a preliminary or permanent injunction or other relief, including,
5 without limitation, the recovery of a civil penalty, disgorgement, restitution or the recovery of
6 damages by bringing an action in the name of the State against a person the Attorney General
7 has reason to believe has engaged or is engaging in a deceptive trade practice. (NRS
8 598.0963) Section 3 of this bill provides that such relief includes any available remedy
9 relating to certain activities that constitute deceptive trade practices. Section 3 also clarifies
10 that such an action may be brought by the Attorney General on behalf of: (1) the State or its
11 agencies, political subdivisions, districts or municipal corporations; or (2) the people of the
12 State.
13 Existing law authorizes the Director of the Department of Business and Industry to
14 impose certain penalties, including an administrative fine, upon a person who has engaged in a
15 deceptive trade practice after a hearing that is initiated by the Commissioner of Consumer
16 Affairs or Attorney General serving an order upon such person. (NRS 598.0971) Section 4 of
17 this bill: (1) increases the administrative fine from $1,000 or treble the amount of restitution
18 ordered, whichever is greater, to not more than $15,000 for each violation or treble the amount
19 of restitution ordered, whichever is greater; and (2) revises the authorized methods of service
20 of the order imposing certain civil penalties.

Assembly Amendment No. 562 to Senate Bill No. 49 First Reprint Page 4
21 Existing law creates the Consumer Protection Legal Account in the Office of the Attorney
22 General and provides that the money remains in the Legal Account at the end of the fiscal
23 year and does not revert to the State General Fund. (NRS 228.333) Existing law: (1) creates
24 the Bureau of Consumer Protection within the Office of the Attorney General; and (2)
25 provides that the executive head of the Bureau of Consumer Protection is the Consumer’s
26 Advocate, who may generally exercise the power of the Attorney General in areas of
27 consumer protection and enforcement. (NRS 228.310, 228.380) Existing law also creates the
28 Consumer Protection Administrative Account in the Bureau of Consumer Protection and: (1)
29 requires the deposit of certain money from settlements and litigation into the Administrative
30 Account; and (2) provides that any balance in excess of $500,000 in the Administrative
31 Account on June 30 and December 31 of each year, and at any other time in the discretion of
32 the Consumer’s Advocate, reverts to the Legal Account. (NRS 228.332) Existing law requires
33 the Attorney General to allocate, in certain percentages, the money in the Legal Account to:
34 (1) the Office of the Attorney General or the Consumer’s Advocate to be used for consumer
35 protection and efforts to prevent fraud, including, without limitation, education, investigation,
36 enforcement and litigation; and (2) certain legal aid organizations to be used for consumer
37 protection and efforts to prevent fraud. (NRS 228.334) Section 11 of this bill provides that the
38 percentage of money allocated from the Legal Account to the Office of the Attorney General
39 or the Consumer’s Advocate may be used to pay for: (1) necessary staff employed for the
40 Consumer’s Advocate to carry out consumer protection and efforts to prevent fraud; (2)
41 necessary staff for the Office of the Attorney General to carry out consumer protection and
42 efforts to prevent fraud; and (3) any other additional purpose relating to consumer protection
43 and efforts to prevent fraud.
44 Section 11 also eliminates the limitation that the money in the Legal Account must
45 exceed 120 days of operating costs for certain staff before the Office of the Attorney General
46 or Consumer’s Advocate may use money in the Legal Account for additional purposes
47 relating to consumer protection and efforts to prevent fraud.
48 Existing law authorizes the Consumer’s Advocate to have access to all records in the
49 possession of any agency, board or commission of this State that he or she determines are
50 necessary to exercise his or her powers relating to consumer protection. (NRS 228.380)
51 Section 12 of this bill clarifies that the Consumer’s Advocate does not have possession of
52 such records until he or she receives the record from the agency, board or commission.
53 Sections 12 and 12.5 of this bill provide that [any records, files and communications of] if a
54 record that is received by the Consumer’s Advocate [made or received pursuant to section
55 12 are] is confidential and not a public record [.] when in the custody or control of the
56 agency, board or commission, the record is confidential and not a public record when in
57 the custody or control of the Consumer’s Advocate.

1 any manner affect the federal laws governing copyrights or enlarge, diminish or
2 affect in any other manner the rights of a person in any written book or record
3 which is copyrighted pursuant to federal law.
4 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record which is
5 copyrighted solely because it is copyrighted.
6 3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a public book or
7 record shall not deny a request made pursuant to subsection 1 to inspect or copy or
8 receive a copy of a public book or record on the basis that the requested public
9 book or record contains information that is confidential if the governmental entity
10 can redact, delete, conceal or separate, including, without limitation, electronically,
11 the confidential information from the information included in the public book or
12 record that is not otherwise confidential.
13 4. If requested, a governmental entity shall provide a copy of a public record
14 in an electronic format by means of an electronic medium. Nothing in this
15 subsection requires a governmental entity to provide a copy of a public record in an
16 electronic format or by means of an electronic medium if:
17 (a) The public record:
18 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
19 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
20 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by means of an
21 electronic medium would:
22 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
23 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential and that
24 cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from information that is not
25 otherwise confidential.
26 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who has legal
27 custody or control of a public record:
28 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the medium that
29 is requested because the officer, employee or agent has already prepared or would
30 prefer to provide the copy in a different medium.
31 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon request, prepare
32 the copy of the public record and shall not require the person who has requested the
33 copy to prepare the copy himself or herself.
34 Sec. 13. This act becomes effective on July 1, 2025.
