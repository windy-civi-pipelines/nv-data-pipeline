providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law defines activities that constitute deceptive trade practices and provides for
2 the imposition of civil and criminal penalties against persons who engage in deceptive trade
3 practices. (Chapter 598 of NRS) Existing law authorizes the Attorney General to obtain a
4 temporary restraining order, a preliminary or permanent injunction or other relief, including,
5 without limitation, the recovery of a civil penalty, disgorgement, restitution or the recovery of
6 damages by bringing an action in the name of the State against a person the Attorney General
7 has reason to believe has engaged or is engaging in a deceptive trade practice. (NRS
8 598.0963) Section 3 of this bill provides that such relief includes any available remedy
9 relating to certain activities that constitute deceptive trade practices. Section 3 also
10 clarifies that such an action may be brought by the Attorney General on behalf of: (1) the
11 State or its agencies, political subdivisions, districts or municipal corporations; or (2) the
12 people of the State.

Senate Amendment No. 180 to Senate Bill No. 49 Page 4
13 Existing law [: (1) creates the Bureau of Consumer Protection within the Office of the
14 Attorney General; and (2) provides that the executive head of the Bureau of Consumer
15 Protection is the Consumer’s Advocate, who may generally exercise the power of the
16 Attorney General in areas of consumer protection and enforcement. (NRS 228.310, 228.380)
17 Existing law further] authorizes the Director of the Department of Business and Industry to
18 impose certain penalties, including an administrative fine, upon a person who has engaged in a
19 deceptive trade practice after a hearing that is initiated by the Commissioner of Consumer
20 Affairs or Attorney General serving an order upon such person. (NRS 598.0971) Section 4 of
21 this bill: (1) [authorizes the Consumer’s Advocate or his or her designee to also conduct such
22 a hearing and impose certain penalties; and (2)] increases the administrative fine from $1,000
23 or treble the amount of restitution ordered, whichever is greater, to not more than $15,000 for
24 each violation or treble the amount of restitution ordered, whichever is greater [. Sections 5
25 and 6 of this bill make conforming changes to authorize the Consumer’s Advocate or his or
26 her designee to impose certain penalties in a hearing conducted by the Consumer’s Advocate
27 or his or her designee relating to a deceptive trade practice directed towards an elderly person,
28 a person with a disability or a minor person.
29 Existing law provides that if a person fails to comply with an order issued by the Director
30 of the Department of Business and Industry or his or her designee at an administrative
31 hearing, the Attorney General or the Commissioner of Consumer Affairs or Director, through
32 the Attorney General, may cause an action to be instituted in district court. If the court finds
33 that the person failed to comply with the order, the court is: (1) required to issue an order
34 enforcing the Director’s order; and (2) authorized to order certain additional sanctions against
35 the person who engaged in the deceptive trade practice, including a penalty of not more than
36 $5,000 for each act amounting to a failure to comply with the original order, an order to cease
37 and desist doing business within the State and injunctive relief. (NRS 598.0971) Existing law
38 also authorizes these sanctions in a circumstance where a person who has engaged or is
39 engaging in a deceptive trade practice fails to comply with an assurance of discontinuance of
40 any deceptive trade practice. Section 4 eliminates the authority of the court to impose these
41 additional sanctions in a circumstance where a person who engaged in a deceptive trade
42 practice fails to comply with the order issued at an administrative hearing. Section 7 of this
43 bill makes a technical change to continue to allow these additional sanctions where a person
44 who has engaged or is engaging in a deceptive trade practice fails to comply with an assurance
45 of discontinuance of any deceptive trade practice.
46 Under existing law, in addition to certain criminal penalties, if a natural person, firm, or
47 any officer or managing agent of any corporation or association knowingly and willfully
48 engages in certain deceptive trade practices, the court may require the natural person, firm or
49 officer or managing agent of the corporation or association to pay to the aggrieved party
50 damages on all profits derived from the knowing and willful engagement in the deceptive
51 trade practice. (NRS 598.0999) Section 8 of this bill provides instead that the court may
52 require payment to the aggrieved party of damages on all gross revenue derived from the
53 knowing and willful engagement in the deceptive trade practice. Section 8 defines “gross
54 revenue” to mean the total revenues derived from the knowing and willful engagement in a
55 deceptive trade practice without deducting any expenses or losses.
56 Section 1 of this bill defines the term “Consumer’s Advocate” for purposes of the
57 provisions of law relating to deceptive trade practices and section 2 of this bill applies this
58 definition to the provisions of existing law governing deceptive trade practices.
59 The Nevada Unfair Trade Practice Act generally prohibits certain unfair trade activities,
60 including, without limitation, price fixing, division of markets, allocation of customers, tying
61 arrangements and monopolization and authorizes the Attorney General to bring proceedings
62 for suspected violations. (Chapter 598A of NRS) Pursuant to the Act, the Attorney General is
63 required to institute civil and criminal proceedings on behalf of the State, its agencies,
64 political subdivisions, districts, municipal corporations or residents of this State. (NRS
65 598A.070) The Act also authorizes certain other persons and entities to bring a civil action
66 related to unfair trade activities. (NRS 598A.200, 598A.210) The Act sets forth the statute of
67 limitations for bringing any such action. (NRS 598A.220) Sections 9 and 10 of this bill
68 eliminate the statute of limitations for the Attorney General to commence a civil action for an
69 unfair trade practice, which is consistent with the authority of the Attorney General to
70 commence a civil action for most deceptive trade practices.] ; and (2) revises the authorized
71 methods of service of the order imposing certain civil penalties.

Senate Amendment No. 180 to Senate Bill No. 49 Page 5
72 Existing law creates the Consumer Protection Legal Account in the Office of the Attorney
73 General and provides that the money remains in the Legal Account at the end of the fiscal
74 year and does not revert to the State General Fund. (NRS 228.333) Existing law: (1) creates
75 the Bureau of Consumer Protection within the Office of the Attorney General; and (2)
76 provides that the executive head of the Bureau of Consumer Protection is the
77 Consumer’s Advocate, who may generally exercise the power of the Attorney General in
78 areas of consumer protection and enforcement. (NRS 228.310, 228.380) Existing law also
79 creates the Consumer Protection Administrative Account in the Bureau of Consumer
80 Protection and: (1) requires the deposit of certain money from settlements and litigation into
81 the Administrative Account; and (2) provides that any balance in excess of $500,000 in the
82 Administrative Account on June 30 and December 31 of each year, and at any other time in
83 the discretion of the Consumer’s Advocate, reverts to the Legal Account. (NRS 228.332)
84 Existing law requires the Attorney General to allocate, in certain percentages, the money in
85 the Legal Account to: (1) the Office of the Attorney General or the Consumer’s Advocate to
86 be used for consumer protection and efforts to prevent fraud, including, without limitation,
87 education, investigation, enforcement and litigation; and (2) certain legal aid organizations to
88 be used for consumer protection and efforts to prevent fraud. (NRS 228.334) Section 11 of
89 this bill provides that the percentage of money allocated from the Legal Account to the Office
90 of the Attorney General or the Consumer’s Advocate may be used to pay for: (1) necessary
91 staff employed for the Consumer’s Advocate to carry out consumer protection and efforts to
92 prevent fraud; (2) necessary staff for the Office of the Attorney General to carry out consumer
93 protection and efforts to prevent fraud; and (3) any other additional purpose relating to
94 consumer protection and efforts to prevent fraud.
95 Section 11 also eliminates the limitation that the money in the Legal Account must
96 exceed 120 days of operating costs for certain staff before the Office of the Attorney General
97 or Consumer’s Advocate may use money in the Legal Account for additional purposes
98 relating to consumer protection and efforts to prevent fraud.
99 Existing law authorizes the Consumer’s Advocate to have access to all records in the
100 possession of any agency, board or commission of this State that he or she determines are
101 necessary to exercise his or her powers relating to consumer protection. (NRS 228.380)
102 Section 12 of this bill clarifies that the Consumer’s Advocate does not have possession of
103 such records until he or she receives the record from the agency, board or commission.
104 Sections 12 and 12.5 of this bill provide that any records, files and communications of
105 the Consumer’s Advocate made or received pursuant to section 12 are confidential and
106 not a public record.

4 and section 2 of chapter 391, Statutes of Nevada 2013 and unless otherwise
5 declared by law to be confidential, all public books and public records of a
6 governmental entity must be open at all times during office hours to inspection by
7 any person, and may be fully copied or an abstract or memorandum may be
8 prepared from those public books and public records. Any such copies, abstracts or
9 memoranda may be used to supply the general public with copies, abstracts or
10 memoranda of the records or may be used in any other way to the advantage of the
11 governmental entity or of the general public. This section does not supersede or in
12 any manner affect the federal laws governing copyrights or enlarge, diminish or
13 affect in any other manner the rights of a person in any written book or record
14 which is copyrighted pursuant to federal law.
15 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record which is
16 copyrighted solely because it is copyrighted.
17 3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a public book or
18 record shall not deny a request made pursuant to subsection 1 to inspect or copy or
19 receive a copy of a public book or record on the basis that the requested public
20 book or record contains information that is confidential if the governmental entity
21 can redact, delete, conceal or separate, including, without limitation, electronically,
22 the confidential information from the information included in the public book or
23 record that is not otherwise confidential.
24 4. If requested, a governmental entity shall provide a copy of a public record
25 in an electronic format by means of an electronic medium. Nothing in this
26 subsection requires a governmental entity to provide a copy of a public record in an
27 electronic format or by means of an electronic medium if:
28 (a) The public record:
29 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
30 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
31 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by means of an
32 electronic medium would:
33 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
34 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential and that
35 cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from information that is not
36 otherwise confidential.
37 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who has legal
38 custody or control of a public record:
39 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the medium that
40 is requested because the officer, employee or agent has already prepared or would
41 prefer to provide the copy in a different medium.
42 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon request, prepare
43 the copy of the public record and shall not require the person who has requested the
44 copy to prepare the copy himself or herself.
45 Sec. 13. This act becomes effective on July 1, 2025.
