CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to consumer protection; clarifying the authority of
the Attorney General with respect to bringing certain actions
relating to deceptive trade practices; revising certain civil
penalties relating to deceptive trade practices; revising the
authorized uses of money in the Consumer Protection Legal
Account in the Office of the Attorney General; clarifying
when the Consumer’s Advocate of the Bureau of Consumer

and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law defines activities that constitute deceptive trade practices and
provides for the imposition of civil and criminal penalties against persons who
engage in deceptive trade practices. (Chapter 598 of NRS) Existing law authorizes
the Attorney General to obtain a temporary restraining order, a preliminary or
permanent injunction or other relief, including, without limitation, the recovery of a
civil penalty, disgorgement, restitution or the recovery of damages by bringing an
action in the name of the State against a person the Attorney General has reason to
believe has engaged or is engaging in a deceptive trade practice. (NRS 598.0963)

Section 2:
Section 3 of this bill provides that such relief includes any available remedy
relating to certain activities that constitute deceptive trade practices. Section 3 also
clarifies that such an action may be brought by the Attorney General on behalf of:
(1) the State or its agencies, political subdivisions, districts or municipal
corporations; or (2) the people of the State.
Existing law authorizes the Director of the Department of Business and
Industry to impose certain penalties, including an administrative fine, upon a person
who has engaged in a deceptive trade practice after a hearing that is initiated by the
Commissioner of Consumer Affairs or Attorney General serving an order upon
such person. (NRS 598.0971) Section 4 of this bill: (1) increases the administrative
fine from $1,000 or treble the amount of restitution ordered, whichever is greater,
to not more than $15,000 for each violation or treble the amount of restitution
ordered, whichever is greater; and (2) revises the authorized methods of service of
the order imposing certain civil penalties.
Existing law creates the Consumer Protection Legal Account in the Office of
the Attorney General and provides that the money remains in the Legal Account at
the end of the fiscal year and does not revert to the State General Fund. (NRS

Section 3:
228.333) Existing law: (1) creates the Bureau of Consumer Protection within the
Office of the Attorney General; and (2) provides that the executive head of the
Bureau of Consumer Protection is the Consumer’s Advocate, who may generally
exercise the power of the Attorney General in areas of consumer protection and
enforcement. (NRS 228.310, 228.380) Existing law also creates the Consumer
Protection Administrative Account in the Bureau of Consumer Protection and: (1)
requires the deposit of certain money from settlements and litigation into the
Administrative Account; and (2) provides that any balance in excess of $500,000 in
the Administrative Account on June 30 and December 31 of each year, and at any
other time in the discretion of the Consumer’s Advocate, reverts to the Legal
-

Account. (NRS 228.332) Existing law requires the Attorney General to allocate, in
certain percentages, the money in the Legal Account to: (1) the Office of the
Attorney General or the Consumer’s Advocate to be used for consumer protection
and efforts to prevent fraud, including, without limitation, education, investigation,
enforcement and litigation; and (2) certain legal aid organizations to be used for
consumer protection and efforts to prevent fraud. (NRS 228.334) Section 11 of this
bill provides that the percentage of money allocated from the Legal Account to the
Office of the Attorney General or the Consumer’s Advocate may be used to pay
for: (1) necessary staff employed for the Consumer’s Advocate to carry out
consumer protection and efforts to prevent fraud; (2) necessary staff for the Office
of the Attorney General to carry out consumer protection and efforts to prevent
fraud; and (3) any other additional purpose relating to consumer protection and
efforts to prevent fraud.

Section 4:
Section 11 also eliminates the limitation that the money in the Legal Account
must exceed 120 days of operating costs for certain staff before the Office of the
Attorney General or Consumer’s Advocate may use money in the Legal Account
for additional purposes relating to consumer protection and efforts to prevent fraud.
Existing law authorizes the Consumer’s Advocate to have access to all records
in the possession of any agency, board or commission of this State that he or she
determines are necessary to exercise his or her powers relating to consumer
protection. (NRS 228.380) Section 12 of this bill clarifies that the Consumer’s
Advocate does not have possession of such records until he or she receives the
record from the agency, board or commission. Sections 12 and 12.5 of this bill
provide that if a record that is received by the Consumer’s Advocate is confidential
and not a public record when in the custody or control of the agency, board or
commission, the record is confidential and not a public record when in the custody
or control of the Consumer’s Advocate.

Raw Text:
Senate Bill No. 49–Committee on Commerce and Labor
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to consumer protection; clarifying the authority of
the Attorney General with respect to bringing certain actions
relating to deceptive trade practices; revising certain civil
penalties relating to deceptive trade practices; revising the
authorized uses of money in the Consumer Protection Legal
Account in the Office of the Attorney General; clarifying
when the Consumer’s Advocate of the Bureau of Consumer
Protection in the Office of the Attorney General has custody
or control of certain records; making certain records, files and
communications of the Consumer’s Advocate confidential;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law defines activities that constitute deceptive trade practices and
provides for the imposition of civil and criminal penalties against persons who
engage in deceptive trade practices. (Chapter 598 of NRS) Existing law authorizes
the Attorney General to obtain a temporary restraining order, a preliminary or
permanent injunction or other relief, including, without limitation, the recovery of a
civil penalty, disgorgement, restitution or the recovery of damages by bringing an
action in the name of the State against a person the Attorney General has reason to
believe has engaged or is engaging in a deceptive trade practice. (NRS 598.0963)
Section 3 of this bill provides that such relief includes any available remedy
relating to certain activities that constitute deceptive trade practices. Section 3 also
clarifies that such an action may be brought by the Attorney General on behalf of:
(1) the State or its agencies, political subdivisions, districts or municipal
corporations; or (2) the people of the State.
Existing law authorizes the Director of the Department of Business and
Industry to impose certain penalties, including an administrative fine, upon a person
who has engaged in a deceptive trade practice after a hearing that is initiated by the
Commissioner of Consumer Affairs or Attorney General serving an order upon
such person. (NRS 598.0971) Section 4 of this bill: (1) increases the administrative
fine from $1,000 or treble the amount of restitution ordered, whichever is greater,
to not more than $15,000 for each violation or treble the amount of restitution
ordered, whichever is greater; and (2) revises the authorized methods of service of
the order imposing certain civil penalties.
Existing law creates the Consumer Protection Legal Account in the Office of
the Attorney General and provides that the money remains in the Legal Account at
the end of the fiscal year and does not revert to the State General Fund. (NRS
228.333) Existing law: (1) creates the Bureau of Consumer Protection within the
Office of the Attorney General; and (2) provides that the executive head of the
Bureau of Consumer Protection is the Consumer’s Advocate, who may generally
exercise the power of the Attorney General in areas of consumer protection and
enforcement. (NRS 228.310, 228.380) Existing law also creates the Consumer
Protection Administrative Account in the Bureau of Consumer Protection and: (1)
requires the deposit of certain money from settlements and litigation into the
Administrative Account; and (2) provides that any balance in excess of $500,000 in
the Administrative Account on June 30 and December 31 of each year, and at any
other time in the discretion of the Consumer’s Advocate, reverts to the Legal
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 2 –
Account. (NRS 228.332) Existing law requires the Attorney General to allocate, in
certain percentages, the money in the Legal Account to: (1) the Office of the
Attorney General or the Consumer’s Advocate to be used for consumer protection
and efforts to prevent fraud, including, without limitation, education, investigation,
enforcement and litigation; and (2) certain legal aid organizations to be used for
consumer protection and efforts to prevent fraud. (NRS 228.334) Section 11 of this
bill provides that the percentage of money allocated from the Legal Account to the
Office of the Attorney General or the Consumer’s Advocate may be used to pay
for: (1) necessary staff employed for the Consumer’s Advocate to carry out
consumer protection and efforts to prevent fraud; (2) necessary staff for the Office
of the Attorney General to carry out consumer protection and efforts to prevent
fraud; and (3) any other additional purpose relating to consumer protection and
efforts to prevent fraud.
Section 11 also eliminates the limitation that the money in the Legal Account
must exceed 120 days of operating costs for certain staff before the Office of the
Attorney General or Consumer’s Advocate may use money in the Legal Account
for additional purposes relating to consumer protection and efforts to prevent fraud.
Existing law authorizes the Consumer’s Advocate to have access to all records
in the possession of any agency, board or commission of this State that he or she
determines are necessary to exercise his or her powers relating to consumer
protection. (NRS 228.380) Section 12 of this bill clarifies that the Consumer’s
Advocate does not have possession of such records until he or she receives the
record from the agency, board or commission. Sections 12 and 12.5 of this bill
provide that if a record that is received by the Consumer’s Advocate is confidential
and not a public record when in the custody or control of the agency, board or
commission, the record is confidential and not a public record when in the custody
or control of the Consumer’s Advocate.

federal laws governing copyrights or enlarge, diminish or affect in
any other manner the rights of a person in any written book or
record which is copyrighted pursuant to federal law.
2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record
which is copyrighted solely because it is copyrighted.
3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a
public book or record shall not deny a request made pursuant to
subsection 1 to inspect or copy or receive a copy of a public book or
record on the basis that the requested public book or record contains
information that is confidential if the governmental entity can
redact, delete, conceal or separate, including, without limitation,
electronically, the confidential information from the information
included in the public book or record that is not otherwise
confidential.

(b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by
means of an electronic medium would:
(1) Give access to proprietary software; or
(2) Require the production of information that is confidential

information that is not otherwise confidential.
5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who
has legal custody or control of a public record:
(a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the
medium that is requested because the officer, employee or agent has
already prepared or would prefer to provide the copy in a different
medium.
(b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon
request, prepare the copy of the public record and shall not require
