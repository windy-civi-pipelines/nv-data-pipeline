Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law defines activities that constitute deceptive trade practices and
2 provides for the imposition of civil and criminal penalties against persons who
3 engage in deceptive trade practices. (Chapter 598 of NRS) Existing law authorizes
4 the Attorney General to obtain a temporary restraining order, a preliminary or
5 permanent injunction or other relief, including, without limitation, the recovery of a
6 civil penalty, disgorgement, restitution or the recovery of damages by bringing an
7 action in the name of the State against a person the Attorney General has reason to
8 believe has engaged or is engaging in a deceptive trade practice. (NRS 598.0963)
9 Section 3 of this bill provides that such relief includes any available remedy
10 relating to certain activities that constitute deceptive trade practices. Section 3 also
11 clarifies that such an action may be brought by the Attorney General on behalf of:
-
*SB49_R2*

– 2 –
12 (1) the State or its agencies, political subdivisions, districts or municipal
13 corporations; or (2) the people of the State.
14 Existing law authorizes the Director of the Department of Business and
15 Industry to impose certain penalties, including an administrative fine, upon a person
16 who has engaged in a deceptive trade practice after a hearing that is initiated by the
17 Commissioner of Consumer Affairs or Attorney General serving an order upon
18 such person. (NRS 598.0971) Section 4 of this bill: (1) increases the administrative
19 fine from $1,000 or treble the amount of restitution ordered, whichever is greater,
20 to not more than $15,000 for each violation or treble the amount of restitution
21 ordered, whichever is greater; and (2) revises the authorized methods of service of
22 the order imposing certain civil penalties.
23 Existing law creates the Consumer Protection Legal Account in the Office of
24 the Attorney General and provides that the money remains in the Legal Account at
25 the end of the fiscal year and does not revert to the State General Fund. (NRS
26 228.333) Existing law: (1) creates the Bureau of Consumer Protection within the
27 Office of the Attorney General; and (2) provides that the executive head of the
28 Bureau of Consumer Protection is the Consumer’s Advocate, who may generally
29 exercise the power of the Attorney General in areas of consumer protection and
30 enforcement. (NRS 228.310, 228.380) Existing law also creates the Consumer
31 Protection Administrative Account in the Bureau of Consumer Protection and: (1)
32 requires the deposit of certain money from settlements and litigation into the
33 Administrative Account; and (2) provides that any balance in excess of $500,000 in
34 the Administrative Account on June 30 and December 31 of each year, and at any
35 other time in the discretion of the Consumer’s Advocate, reverts to the Legal
36 Account. (NRS 228.332) Existing law requires the Attorney General to allocate, in
37 certain percentages, the money in the Legal Account to: (1) the Office of the
38 Attorney General or the Consumer’s Advocate to be used for consumer protection
39 and efforts to prevent fraud, including, without limitation, education, investigation,
40 enforcement and litigation; and (2) certain legal aid organizations to be used for
41 consumer protection and efforts to prevent fraud. (NRS 228.334) Section 11 of this
42 bill provides that the percentage of money allocated from the Legal Account to the
43 Office of the Attorney General or the Consumer’s Advocate may be used to pay
44 for: (1) necessary staff employed for the Consumer’s Advocate to carry out
45 consumer protection and efforts to prevent fraud; (2) necessary staff for the Office
46 of the Attorney General to carry out consumer protection and efforts to prevent
47 fraud; and (3) any other additional purpose relating to consumer protection and
48 efforts to prevent fraud.
49 Section 11 also eliminates the limitation that the money in the Legal Account
50 must exceed 120 days of operating costs for certain staff before the Office of the
51 Attorney General or Consumer’s Advocate may use money in the Legal Account
52 for additional purposes relating to consumer protection and efforts to prevent fraud.
53 Existing law authorizes the Consumer’s Advocate to have access to all records
54 in the possession of any agency, board or commission of this State that he or she
55 determines are necessary to exercise his or her powers relating to consumer
56 protection. (NRS 228.380) Section 12 of this bill clarifies that the Consumer’s
57 Advocate does not have possession of such records until he or she receives the
58 record from the agency, board or commission. Sections 12 and 12.5 of this bill
59 provide that if a record that is received by the Consumer’s Advocate is confidential
60 and not a public record when in the custody or control of the agency, board or
61 commission, the record is confidential and not a public record when in the custody
62 or control of the Consumer’s Advocate.

39 electronically, the confidential information from the information
40 included in the public book or record that is not otherwise
41 confidential.

1 to provide a copy of a public record in an electronic format or by
2 means of an electronic medium if:

4 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
5 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
6 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by

11 information that is not otherwise confidential.
12 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who
13 has legal custody or control of a public record:

17 medium.
18 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon
19 request, prepare the copy of the public record and shall not require
