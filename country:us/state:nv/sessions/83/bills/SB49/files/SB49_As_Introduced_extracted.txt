Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law defines activities that constitute deceptive trade practices and
2 provides for the imposition of civil and criminal penalties against persons who
3 engage in deceptive trade practices. (Chapter 598 of NRS) Existing law authorizes
4 the Attorney General to obtain a temporary restraining order, a preliminary or
5 permanent injunction or other relief, including, without limitation, the recovery of a
6 civil penalty, disgorgement, restitution or the recovery of damages by bringing an
-
*SB49*
– 2 –
7 action in the name of the State against a person the Attorney General has reason to
8 believe has engaged or is engaging in a deceptive trade practice. (NRS 598.0963)
9 Section 3 of this bill clarifies that such an action may be brought by the Attorney
10 General on behalf of: (1) the State or its agencies, political subdivisions, districts or
11 municipal corporations; or (2) the people of the State.
12 Existing law: (1) creates the Bureau of Consumer Protection within the Office
13 of the Attorney General; and (2) provides that the executive head of the Bureau of
14 Consumer Protection is the Consumer’s Advocate, who may generally exercise the
15 power of the Attorney General in areas of consumer protection and enforcement.
16 (NRS 228.310, 228.380) Existing law further authorizes the Director of the
17 Department of Business and Industry to impose certain penalties, including an
18 administrative fine, upon a person who has engaged in a deceptive trade practice
19 after a hearing that is initiated by the Commissioner of Consumer Affairs or
20 Attorney General serving an order upon such person. (NRS 598.0971) Section 4 of
21 this bill: (1) authorizes the Consumer’s Advocate or his or her designee to also
22 conduct such a hearing and impose certain penalties; and (2) increases the
23 administrative fine from $1,000 or treble the amount of restitution ordered,
24 whichever is greater, to $15,000 for each violation or treble the amount of
25 restitution ordered, whichever is greater. Sections 5 and 6 of this bill make
26 conforming changes to authorize the Consumer’s Advocate or his or her designee
27 to impose certain penalties in a hearing conducted by the Consumer’s Advocate or
28 his or her designee relating to a deceptive trade practice directed towards an elderly
29 person, a person with a disability or a minor person.
30 Existing law provides that if a person fails to comply with an order issued by
31 the Director of the Department of Business and Industry or his or her designee at an
32 administrative hearing, the Attorney General or the Commissioner of Consumer
33 Affairs or Director, through the Attorney General, may cause an action to be
34 instituted in district court. If the court finds that the person failed to comply with
35 the order, the court is: (1) required to issue an order enforcing the Director’s order;
36 and (2) authorized to order certain additional sanctions against the person who
37 engaged in the deceptive trade practice, including a penalty of not more than $5,000
38 for each act amounting to a failure to comply with the original order, an order to
39 cease and desist doing business within the State and injunctive relief. (NRS
40 598.0971) Existing law also authorizes these sanctions in a circumstance where a
41 person who has engaged or is engaging in a deceptive trade practice fails to comply
42 with an assurance of discontinuance of any deceptive trade practice. Section 4
43 eliminates the authority of the court to impose these additional sanctions in a
44 circumstance where a person who engaged in a deceptive trade practice fails to
45 comply with the order issued at an administrative hearing. Section 7 of this bill
46 makes a technical change to continue to allow these additional sanctions where a
47 person who has engaged or is engaging in a deceptive trade practice fails to comply
48 with an assurance of discontinuance of any deceptive trade practice.
49 Under existing law, in addition to certain criminal penalties, if a natural person,
50 firm, or any officer or managing agent of any corporation or association knowingly
51 and willfully engages in certain deceptive trade practices, the court may require the
52 natural person, firm or officer or managing agent of the corporation or association
53 to pay to the aggrieved party damages on all profits derived from the knowing and
54 willful engagement in the deceptive trade practice. (NRS 598.0999) Section 8 of
55 this bill provides instead that the court may require payment to the aggrieved party
56 of damages on all gross revenue derived from the knowing and willful engagement
57 in the deceptive trade practice. Section 8 defines “gross revenue” to mean the total
58 revenues derived from the knowing and willful engagement in a deceptive trade
59 practice without deducting any expenses or losses.
60 Section 1 of this bill defines the term “Consumer’s Advocate” for purposes of
61 the provisions of law relating to deceptive trade practices and section 2 of this bill
-
*SB49*
– 3 –
62 applies this definition to the provisions of existing law governing deceptive trade
63 practices.
64 The Nevada Unfair Trade Practice Act generally prohibits certain unfair trade
65 activities, including, without limitation, price fixing, division of markets, allocation
66 of customers, tying arrangements and monopolization and authorizes the Attorney
67 General to bring proceedings for suspected violations. (Chapter 598A of NRS)
68 Pursuant to the Act, the Attorney General is required to institute civil and criminal
69 proceedings on behalf of the State, its agencies, political subdivisions, districts,
70 municipal corporations or residents of this State. (NRS 598A.070) The Act also
71 authorizes certain other persons and entities to bring a civil action related to unfair
72 trade activities. (NRS 598A.200, 598A.210) The Act sets forth the statute of
73 limitations for bringing any such action. (NRS 598A.220) Sections 9 and 10 of this
74 bill eliminate the statute of limitations for the Attorney General to commence a
75 civil action for an unfair trade practice, which is consistent with the authority of the
76 Attorney General to commence a civil action for most deceptive trade practices.
77 Existing law creates the Consumer Protection Legal Account in the Office of
78 the Attorney General and provides that the money remains in the Legal Account at
79 the end of the fiscal year and does not revert to the State General Fund. (NRS
80 228.333) Existing law also creates the Consumer Protection Administrative
81 Account in the Bureau of Consumer Protection and: (1) requires the deposit of
82 certain money from settlements and litigation into the Administrative Account; and
83 (2) provides that any balance in excess of $500,000 in the Administrative Account
84 on June 30 and December 31 of each year, and at any other time in the discretion of
85 the Consumer’s Advocate, reverts to the Legal Account. (NRS 228.332) Existing
86 law requires the Attorney General to allocate, in certain percentages, the money in
87 the Legal Account to: (1) the Office of the Attorney General or the Consumer’s
88 Advocate to be used for consumer protection and efforts to prevent fraud,
89 including, without limitation, education, investigation, enforcement and litigation;
90 and (2) certain legal aid organizations to be used for consumer protection and
91 efforts to prevent fraud. (NRS 228.334) Section 11 of this bill provides that the
92 percentage of money allocated from the Legal Account to the Office of the
93 Attorney General or the Consumer’s Advocate may be used to pay for: (1)
94 necessary staff employed for the Consumer’s Advocate to carry out consumer
95 protection and efforts to prevent fraud; (2) necessary staff for the Office of the
96 Attorney General to carry out consumer protection and efforts to prevent fraud; and
97 (3) any other additional purpose relating to consumer protection and efforts to
98 prevent fraud.
99 Section 11 also eliminates the limitation that the money in the Legal Account
100 must exceed 120 days of operating costs for certain staff before the Office of the
101 Attorney General or Consumer’s Advocate may use money in the Legal Account
102 for additional purposes relating to consumer protection and efforts to prevent fraud.
103 Existing law authorizes the Consumer’s Advocate to have access to all records
104 in the possession of any agency, board or commission of this State that he or she
105 determines are necessary to exercise his or her powers relating to consumer
106 protection. (NRS 228.380) Section 12 of this bill clarifies that the Consumer’s
107 Advocate does not have possession of such records until he or she receives the
108 record from the agency, board or commission.

S.B. 49
SENATE BILL NO. 49–COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE AND LABOR
(ON BEHALF OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL)
PREFILED NOVEMBER 19, 2024
____________
Referred to Committee on Commerce and Labor
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to consumer protection.
(BDR 52-439)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to consumer protection; clarifying the authority of
the Attorney General with respect to bringing certain
actions relating to deceptive trade practices; authorizing
the Consumer’s Advocate of the Bureau of Consumer
Protection in the Office of the Attorney General to
conduct certain administrative hearings and impose
certain civil penalties relating to deceptive trade practices;
eliminating certain sanctions that may be imposed by a
court relating to deceptive trade practices; eliminating the
statute of limitations for civil actions involving unfair
trade practices which are brought by the Attorney
General; revising the authorized uses of money in the
Consumer Protection Legal Account in the Office of the
Attorney General; clarifying when the Consumer’s
Advocate has custody or control of certain records;
making various other changes relating to deceptive trade
practices; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law defines activities that constitute deceptive trade practices and
2 provides for the imposition of civil and criminal penalties against persons who
3 engage in deceptive trade practices. (Chapter 598 of NRS) Existing law authorizes
4 the Attorney General to obtain a temporary restraining order, a preliminary or
5 permanent injunction or other relief, including, without limitation, the recovery of a
6 civil penalty, disgorgement, restitution or the recovery of damages by bringing an
-
*SB49*

– 2 –
7 action in the name of the State against a person the Attorney General has reason to
8 believe has engaged or is engaging in a deceptive trade practice. (NRS 598.0963)
9 Section 3 of this bill clarifies that such an action may be brought by the Attorney
10 General on behalf of: (1) the State or its agencies, political subdivisions, districts or
11 municipal corporations; or (2) the people of the State.
12 Existing law: (1) creates the Bureau of Consumer Protection within the Office
13 of the Attorney General; and (2) provides that the executive head of the Bureau of
14 Consumer Protection is the Consumer’s Advocate, who may generally exercise the
15 power of the Attorney General in areas of consumer protection and enforcement.
16 (NRS 228.310, 228.380) Existing law further authorizes the Director of the
17 Department of Business and Industry to impose certain penalties, including an
18 administrative fine, upon a person who has engaged in a deceptive trade practice
19 after a hearing that is initiated by the Commissioner of Consumer Affairs or
20 Attorney General serving an order upon such person. (NRS 598.0971) Section 4 of
21 this bill: (1) authorizes the Consumer’s Advocate or his or her designee to also
22 conduct such a hearing and impose certain penalties; and (2) increases the
23 administrative fine from $1,000 or treble the amount of restitution ordered,
24 whichever is greater, to $15,000 for each violation or treble the amount of
25 restitution ordered, whichever is greater. Sections 5 and 6 of this bill make
26 conforming changes to authorize the Consumer’s Advocate or his or her designee
27 to impose certain penalties in a hearing conducted by the Consumer’s Advocate or
28 his or her designee relating to a deceptive trade practice directed towards an elderly
29 person, a person with a disability or a minor person.
30 Existing law provides that if a person fails to comply with an order issued by
31 the Director of the Department of Business and Industry or his or her designee at an
32 administrative hearing, the Attorney General or the Commissioner of Consumer
33 Affairs or Director, through the Attorney General, may cause an action to be
34 instituted in district court. If the court finds that the person failed to comply with
35 the order, the court is: (1) required to issue an order enforcing the Director’s order;
36 and (2) authorized to order certain additional sanctions against the person who
37 engaged in the deceptive trade practice, including a penalty of not more than $5,000
38 for each act amounting to a failure to comply with the original order, an order to
39 cease and desist doing business within the State and injunctive relief. (NRS
40 598.0971) Existing law also authorizes these sanctions in a circumstance where a
41 person who has engaged or is engaging in a deceptive trade practice fails to comply
42 with an assurance of discontinuance of any deceptive trade practice. Section 4
43 eliminates the authority of the court to impose these additional sanctions in a
44 circumstance where a person who engaged in a deceptive trade practice fails to
45 comply with the order issued at an administrative hearing. Section 7 of this bill
46 makes a technical change to continue to allow these additional sanctions where a
47 person who has engaged or is engaging in a deceptive trade practice fails to comply
48 with an assurance of discontinuance of any deceptive trade practice.
49 Under existing law, in addition to certain criminal penalties, if a natural person,
50 firm, or any officer or managing agent of any corporation or association knowingly
51 and willfully engages in certain deceptive trade practices, the court may require the
52 natural person, firm or officer or managing agent of the corporation or association
53 to pay to the aggrieved party damages on all profits derived from the knowing and
54 willful engagement in the deceptive trade practice. (NRS 598.0999) Section 8 of
55 this bill provides instead that the court may require payment to the aggrieved party
56 of damages on all gross revenue derived from the knowing and willful engagement
57 in the deceptive trade practice. Section 8 defines “gross revenue” to mean the total
58 revenues derived from the knowing and willful engagement in a deceptive trade
59 practice without deducting any expenses or losses.
60 Section 1 of this bill defines the term “Consumer’s Advocate” for purposes of
61 the provisions of law relating to deceptive trade practices and section 2 of this bill
-
*SB49*

– 3 –
62 applies this definition to the provisions of existing law governing deceptive trade
63 practices.
64 The Nevada Unfair Trade Practice Act generally prohibits certain unfair trade
65 activities, including, without limitation, price fixing, division of markets, allocation
66 of customers, tying arrangements and monopolization and authorizes the Attorney
67 General to bring proceedings for suspected violations. (Chapter 598A of NRS)
68 Pursuant to the Act, the Attorney General is required to institute civil and criminal
69 proceedings on behalf of the State, its agencies, political subdivisions, districts,
70 municipal corporations or residents of this State. (NRS 598A.070) The Act also
71 authorizes certain other persons and entities to bring a civil action related to unfair
72 trade activities. (NRS 598A.200, 598A.210) The Act sets forth the statute of
73 limitations for bringing any such action. (NRS 598A.220) Sections 9 and 10 of this
74 bill eliminate the statute of limitations for the Attorney General to commence a
75 civil action for an unfair trade practice, which is consistent with the authority of the
76 Attorney General to commence a civil action for most deceptive trade practices.
77 Existing law creates the Consumer Protection Legal Account in the Office of
78 the Attorney General and provides that the money remains in the Legal Account at
79 the end of the fiscal year and does not revert to the State General Fund. (NRS
80 228.333) Existing law also creates the Consumer Protection Administrative
81 Account in the Bureau of Consumer Protection and: (1) requires the deposit of
82 certain money from settlements and litigation into the Administrative Account; and
83 (2) provides that any balance in excess of $500,000 in the Administrative Account
84 on June 30 and December 31 of each year, and at any other time in the discretion of
85 the Consumer’s Advocate, reverts to the Legal Account. (NRS 228.332) Existing
86 law requires the Attorney General to allocate, in certain percentages, the money in
87 the Legal Account to: (1) the Office of the Attorney General or the Consumer’s
88 Advocate to be used for consumer protection and efforts to prevent fraud,
89 including, without limitation, education, investigation, enforcement and litigation;
90 and (2) certain legal aid organizations to be used for consumer protection and
91 efforts to prevent fraud. (NRS 228.334) Section 11 of this bill provides that the
92 percentage of money allocated from the Legal Account to the Office of the
93 Attorney General or the Consumer’s Advocate may be used to pay for: (1)
94 necessary staff employed for the Consumer’s Advocate to carry out consumer
