with certain exceptions, certain corporate investors in
residential real property in this State to register with the
Securities Division of the Office of the Secretary of State

certain actions; requiring the Secretary of State to
establish requirements for the form and contents of an
instrument that creates a life estate; prohibiting a county
recorder from recording certain deeds and documents
under certain circumstances; and providing other matters

2 aggregate number of units of residential real property in this State that may be

4 any affiliates of such entities must not exceed 100 units; and (2) a corporation,
5 limited-liability company or affiliate of such an entity is prohibited from purchasing

8 during the current calendar year by any corporations, limited-liability companies

25 violate the provisions of section 2 to obtain an injunction or other equitable relief
26 appropriate to ensure compliance with or enforce the provisions of section 2.
27 Existing law sets forth the requirements for recording certain documents that
28 relate to real property. (NRS 111.312) Section 5 of this bill prohibits a county
29 recorder from filing a deed for a unit of residential real property purchased by a
30 corporation, limited-liability company or affiliate of such an entity unless the entity
31 submits to the county recorder for recording, concurrently with the deed to be
32 recorded, a copy of the certificate of registration for that purchase issued by the
33 Secretary of State pursuant to section 2. Section 5 requires a county recorder to
34 provide to the Secretary of State upon request certain information relating to the
35 requirement imposed by section 2.
36 Section 4 of this bill requires the Secretary of State to adopt regulations
37 establishing requirements for the form and contents of any instrument that creates a
38 life estate. Section 5 prohibits a county recorder from recording a document that is
39 such an instrument unless the document complies with those requirements.
