AN ACT relating to real property; limiting, with certain exceptions, the total
aggregate number of units of residential real property in this State that
may be purchased in any 1 calendar year by certain corporate
investors; requiring, with certain exceptions, certain corporate
investors in residential real property in this State to register with the
Securities Division of the Office of the Secretary of State each time
before purchasing a unit of residential real property; authorizing the
Attorney General to bring certain actions; requiring the Secretary of
State to establish requirements for the form and contents of an
instrument that creates a life estate; prohibiting a county recorder from
recording certain deeds and documents under certain circumstances;
[making an appropriation;] and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Section 2 of this bill provides, with certain exceptions, that: (1) the total aggregate
2 number of units of residential real property in this State that may be purchased in any 1
3 calendar year by corporations, limited-liability companies and any affiliates of such entities
4 must not exceed 100 units; and (2) a corporation, limited-liability company or affiliate of such
5 an entity is prohibited from purchasing any unit of residential real property in this State if, as a
6 result of the purchase, the total aggregate number of units of residential real property
7 purchased in this State during the current calendar year by any corporations, limited-liability
8 companies and affiliates of such entities would exceed 100 units.
9 Section 2 also requires the Securities Division of the Office of the Secretary of State to
10 create and maintain a registry of corporations, limited-liability companies and any affiliates of
11 such entities that purchase or own residential real property in this State. Section 2 requires,
12 with certain exceptions, a corporation, limited-liability company or any affiliate of such an
13 entity to register with the Securities Division each time before the entity purchases any unit of
14 residential real property in this State. Section 2 exempts from that requirement a corporation,
15 limited-liability company or affiliate of such an entity that owns less than 10 units of
16 residential real property in this State. Section 2: (1) authorizes the Secretary of State to charge
17 a fee to each such corporation, limited-liability company or affiliate of such an entity; and (2)
18 requires the Secretary of State to adopt regulations necessary to carry out the provisions of
19 section 2. For the purposes of section 2, the term “corporation” does not include a family trust

20 company or a housing authority. Section 3.5 of this bill authorizes the Attorney General, upon
21 the request of the Secretary of State, to bring an action against an entity that violates or
22 proposes to violate the provisions of section 2 to obtain an injunction or other equitable relief
23 appropriate to ensure compliance with or enforce the provisions of section 2.
24 Existing law sets forth the requirements for recording certain documents that relate to real
25 property. (NRS 111.312) Section 5 of this bill prohibits a county recorder from filing a deed
26 for a unit of residential real property purchased by a corporation, limited-liability company or
27 affiliate of such an entity unless the entity submits to the county recorder for recording,
28 concurrently with the deed to be recorded, a copy of the certificate of registration for that
29 purchase issued by the Secretary of State pursuant to section 2. Section 5 requires a county
30 recorder to provide to the Secretary of State upon request certain information relating to the
31 requirement [of] imposed by section 2.
32 Section 4 of this bill requires the Secretary of State to adopt regulations establishing
33 requirements for the form and contents of any instrument that creates a life estate. Section 5
34 prohibits a county recorder from recording a document that is such an instrument unless the
35 document complies with those requirements.
36 [Section 6 of this bill makes an appropriation to the Office of the Secretary of State for
37 personnel, travel, operating, equipment, information services and contractor costs to carry out
38 the provisions of section 2.]
