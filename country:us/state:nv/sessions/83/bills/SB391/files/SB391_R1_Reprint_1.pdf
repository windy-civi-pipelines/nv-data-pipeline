AN ACT relating to real property; limiting, with certain exceptions,
the total aggregate number of units of residential real
property in this State that may be purchased in any 1
calendar year by certain corporate investors; requiring,
with certain exceptions, certain corporate investors in
residential real property in this State to register with the

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Section 2 of this bill provides, with certain exceptions, that: (1) the total
2 aggregate number of units of residential real property in this State that may be
3 purchased in any 1 calendar year by corporations, limited-liability companies and
4 any affiliates of such entities must not exceed 100 units; and (2) a corporation,
5 limited-liability company or affiliate of such an entity is prohibited from purchasing
6 any unit of residential real property in this State if, as a result of the purchase, the
7 total aggregate number of units of residential real property purchased in this State
8 during the current calendar year by any corporations, limited-liability companies
9 and affiliates of such entities would exceed 100 units.
10 Section 2 also requires the Securities Division of the Office of the Secretary of
11 State to create and maintain a registry of corporations, limited-liability companies

12 and any affiliates of such entities that purchase or own residential real property in
13 this State. Section 2 requires, with certain exceptions, a corporation, limited-
14 liability company or any affiliate of such an entity to register with the Securities
15 Division each time before the entity purchases any unit of residential real property
16 in this State. Section 2 exempts from that requirement a corporation, limited-
17 liability company or affiliate of such an entity that owns less than 10 units of
18 residential real property in this State. Section 2: (1) authorizes the Secretary of
19 State to charge a fee to each such corporation, limited-liability company or affiliate
20 of such an entity; and (2) requires the Secretary of State to adopt regulations
21 necessary to carry out the provisions of section 2. For the purposes of section 2, the
22 term “corporation” does not include a family trust company or a housing authority.
23 Section 3.5 of this bill authorizes the Attorney General, upon the request of the
24 Secretary of State, to bring an action against an entity that violates or proposes to
25 violate the provisions of section 2 to obtain an injunction or other equitable relief
26 appropriate to ensure compliance with or enforce the provisions of section 2.
27 Existing law sets forth the requirements for recording certain documents that
28 relate to real property. (NRS 111.312) Section 5 of this bill prohibits a county
29 recorder from filing a deed for a unit of residential real property purchased by a
30 corporation, limited-liability company or affiliate of such an entity unless the entity
31 submits to the county recorder for recording, concurrently with the deed to be
32 recorded, a copy of the certificate of registration for that purchase issued by the
33 Secretary of State pursuant to section 2. Section 5 requires a county recorder to
34 provide to the Secretary of State upon request certain information relating to the
35 requirement of section 2.
36 Section 4 of this bill requires the Secretary of State to adopt regulations
37 establishing requirements for the form and contents of any instrument that creates a
38 life estate. Section 5 prohibits a county recorder from recording a document that is
39 such an instrument unless the document complies with those requirements.
40 Section 6 of this bill makes an appropriation to the Office of the Secretary of
41 State for personnel, travel, operating, equipment, information services and
42 contractor costs to carry out the provisions of section 2.
