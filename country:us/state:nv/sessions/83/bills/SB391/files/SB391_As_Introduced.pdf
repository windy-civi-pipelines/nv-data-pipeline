Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Section 2 of this bill provides, with certain exceptions, that: (1) the total
2 aggregate number of units of residential real property in this State that may be
3 purchased in any 1 calendar year by corporations, limited-liability companies and
4 any affiliates of such entities must not exceed 100 units; and (2) a corporation,
5 limited-liability company or affiliate of such an entity is prohibited from purchasing
6 any unit of residential real property in this State if, as a result of the purchase, the
7 total aggregate number of units of residential real property purchased in this State
8 during the current calendar year by any corporations, limited-liability companies
9 and affiliates of such entities would exceed 100 units.
10 Section 2 also requires the Securities Division of the Office of the Secretary of
11 State to create and maintain a registry of corporations, limited-liability companies
12 and any affiliates of such entities that purchase or own residential real property in
13 this State. Section 2 requires, with certain exceptions, a corporation,

14 limited-liability company or any affiliate of such an entity to register with the
15 Securities Division before purchasing any residential real property in this State.
16 Section 2 exempts from that requirement a corporation, limited-liability company
17 or affiliate of such an entity that owns less than 10 units of residential real property
18 in this State. Section 2: (1) authorizes the Secretary of State to charge a fee to each
19 such corporation, limited-liability company or affiliate of such an entity; and (2)
20 requires the Secretary of State to adopt regulations necessary to carry out the
21 provisions of section 2. For the purposes of section 2, the term “corporation” does
22 not include a family trust company or a housing authority.
23 Existing law sets forth the requirements for recording certain documents that
24 relate to real property. (NRS 111.312) Section 3 of this bill requires the Secretary
25 of State to adopt regulations establishing requirements for the form and contents of
26 a deed for residential real property that is purchased by a corporation, limited-
27 liability company or affiliate of such an entity that owns 10 or more units of
28 residential real property in this State. Section 5 of this bill prohibits a county
29 recorder from filing such a deed unless: (1) the deed complies with those
30 requirements; and (2) the deed is accompanied by a copy of the certificate of
31 registration issued by the Secretary of State pursuant to section 2.
32 Section 4 of this bill requires the Secretary of State to adopt regulations
33 establishing requirements for the form and contents of any instrument that creates a
34 life estate. Section 5 prohibits a county recorder from filing a document that is such
35 an instrument unless the document complies with those requirements.
36 Section 6 of this bill makes an appropriation to the Office of the Secretary of
37 State for personnel, travel, operating, equipment, information services and
38 contractor costs to carry out the provisions of section 2.
