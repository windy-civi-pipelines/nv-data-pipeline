3 calendar year by corporations, limited-liability companies and any affiliates of such entities
4 must not exceed 100 units; and (2) a corporation, limited-liability company or affiliate of such
5 an entity is prohibited from purchasing any unit of residential real property in this State if, as a
6 result of the purchase, the total aggregate number of units of residential real property
7 purchased in this State during the current calendar year by any corporations, limited-liability
8 companies and affiliates of such entities would exceed 100 units.
9 Section 2 also requires the Securities Division of the Office of the Secretary of State to
10 create and maintain a registry of corporations, limited-liability companies and any affiliates of
11 such entities that purchase or own residential real property in this State. Section 2 requires,
12 with certain exceptions, a corporation, limited-liability company or any affiliate of such an

14 purchases any unit of residential real property in this State. Section 2 exempts from that
15 requirement a corporation, limited-liability company or affiliate of such an entity that owns

27 regulations establishing requirements for the form and contents of a deed for residential real
28 property that is purchased by a corporation, limited-liability company or affiliate of such an
29 entity that owns 10 or more units of residential real property in this State.] Section 5 of this
30 bill prohibits a county recorder from filing [such] a deed for a unit of residential real
31 property purchased by a corporation, limited-liability company or affiliate of such an
32 entity unless [: (1) the deed complies with those requirements; and (2)] the entity submits to

39 requirements for the form and contents of any instrument that creates a life estate. Section 5

44 the provisions of section 2.
