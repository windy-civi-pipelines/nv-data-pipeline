AN ACT relating to governmental administration; establishing a limit on
contributions to the campaign of a candidate in certain special
elections; [requiring certain candidates, public officers or former public
officers to notify the Secretary of State when all unspent campaign
contributions have been disposed of;] requiring , with certain
exceptions, a candidate to file a notice of intent to file for candidacy
with the Secretary of State; revising provisions relating to the personal
use of contributions or unspent contributions; revising provisions
relating to the investigation and enforcement of provisions of law
relating to campaign finance and financial disclosure statements;
providing that a labor union and certain corporations and business
organizations are not a committee for political action for purposes
of campaign finance requirements; requiring such entities to

campaign finance; providing penalties; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth limitations on making, soliciting and accepting a campaign
2 contribution for a primary election, a general election or a special election to recall a public
3 officer. (Nev. Const. Art. 2, § 10; NRS 294A.100, 294A.115) Section 6.5 of this bill clarifies
4 that these limits apply regardless of the number of candidates for the office at the primary or
5 general election.
6 Section 2.5 of this bill: (1) establishes a contribution limit of $5,000 for a special election
7 that is not a special election to recall a public officer; and (2) sets forth the period during
8 which such contributions may be made, solicited or accepted.

Senate Amendment No. 681 to Assembly Bill No. 79 First Reprint Page 4
9 Existing law provides that, except in certain circumstances, certain corporations and
10 business organizations as well as labor unions are excluded from the definition of a
11 “committee for political action.” (NRS 294A.0055) Section 6.3 of this bill revises the
12 definition of a “committee for political action” to remove such exceptions, thereby
13 excluding such entities from being considered a committee for political action under any
14 circumstances.
15 Existing law requires certain persons, committees for political action and political
16 parties to report certain independent expenditures or other expenditures. (NRS
17 249A.210) Section 10.3 of this bill requires any entity excluded from the definition of
18 “committee for political action” pursuant to section 6.3 that makes certain expenditures
19 in excess of $1,000 to report such expenditures.
20 Under existing law, it is unlawful for: (1) a candidate to spend money received as a
21 contribution for the candidate’s personal use; or (2) a public officer to spend unspent
22 contributions for the public officer’s personal use. (NRS 294A.160) Section 8.5 of this bill
23 clarifies that these provisions do not prohibit a candidate or public officer from using
24 contributions or unspent contributions, as applicable, to pay for any ordinary and necessary
25 expense that is incurred in connection with the duties of a campaign or public office, as
26 applicable.
27 Existing law requires every candidate, not later than 1 week after receiving minimum
28 contributions of $100, to open and maintain a separate account in a financial institution
29 located in the United States for the deposit of any contributions received. (NRS 294A.130)
30 Section 7 of this bill requires every candidate , except a public officer running for
31 reelection, to also file with the Secretary of State a notice of intent to file for candidacy.
32 Under existing law, if it appears that the provisions of law relating to campaign finance
33 have been violated, the Secretary of State may: (1) conduct an investigation concerning the
34 alleged violation and cause the appropriate proceedings to be instituted and prosecuted in the
35 First Judicial District Court; or (2) refer the alleged violation to the Attorney General for
36 investigation. The Attorney General is required to investigate and institute and prosecute the
37 appropriate proceedings in the First Judicial District Court. (NRS 294A.410) Section 11 of
38 this bill: (1) eliminates provisions relating to instituting any such proceedings in the First
39 Judicial District Court; [and] (2) authorizes the Office of the Secretary of State to conduct an
40 investigation [.] ; (3) requires a person who receives a notice of an alleged violation to
41 submit a response to the Office of the Secretary of State within 15 calendar days after
42 receiving the notice; and (4) authorizes the Office of the Secretary of State to bring the
43 matter before a hearing officer upon the expiration of such a period of time if the person
44 does not submit such a response.
45 Existing law authorizes a person who believes that any provisions of law relating to
46 campaign finance have been violated to notify the Secretary of State, in writing, of the alleged
47 violation. Under certain circumstances, the Secretary of State may conduct an investigation of
48 the alleged violation. (NRS 294A.410) Section 11 provides instead that the Office of the
49 Secretary of State may conduct such an investigation.
50 Existing law authorizes, under certain circumstances, the Secretary of State to cause
51 proceedings to be instituted in the First Judicial District Court to recover certain civil penalties
52 for certain violations of provisions relating to campaign finance. (NRS 294A.420) Section 12
53 of this bill provides instead that the Secretary of State may, after notice and a hearing, impose
54 certain administrative fines for certain violations relating to campaign finance.
55 Section 4.5 of this bill sets forth certain powers and duties of the Secretary of State or
56 certain officers or employees designated by the Secretary of State relating to investigations or
57 proceedings relating to campaign finance. Section 4.5 also requires the Secretary of State
58 or certain officers or employees designated by the Secretary of State to provide certain
59 notice by certified mail to a person to whom the Secretary of State or such an officer or
60 employee intends to issue a subpoena for certain records.
61 Sections 12 and 13.5 of this bill authorize the Secretary of State, for good cause, to
62 reduce certain administrative fines and civil penalties relating to campaign finance and
63 statements of financial disclosure. Sections 12 and 13.5 also: (1) authorize the Secretary of
64 State to enter into payment agreements relating to administrative fines and civil penalties; and
65 (2) require the Secretary of State to maintain on the Internet website of the Office of the
66 Secretary of State a list of persons who have not paid within 90 days any such administrative

Senate Amendment No. 681 to Assembly Bill No. 79 First Reprint Page 5
67 fine or civil penalty. Section 10.5 of this bill makes a conforming change to provide that the
68 Secretary of State may impose an administrative fine for certain violations.
