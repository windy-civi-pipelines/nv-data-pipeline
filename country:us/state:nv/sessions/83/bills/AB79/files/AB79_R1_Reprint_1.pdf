6 Section 2.5 of this bill: (1) establishes a contribution limit of $5,000 for a
7 special election that is not a special election to recall a public officer; and (2) sets
8 forth the period during which such contributions may be made, solicited or
9 accepted.
10 Under existing law, it is unlawful for: (1) a candidate to spend money received
11 as a contribution for the candidate’s personal use; or (2) a public officer to spend
12 unspent contributions for the public officer’s personal use. (NRS 294A.160)
13 Section 8.5 of this bill clarifies that these provisions do not prohibit a candidate or
14 public officer from using contributions or unspent contributions, as applicable, to
15 pay for any ordinary and necessary expense that is incurred in connection with the
16 duties of a campaign or public office, as applicable.
17 Existing law requires every candidate, not later than 1 week after receiving
18 minimum contributions of $100, to open and maintain a separate account in a
19 financial institution located in the United States for the deposit of any contributions
20 received. (NRS 294A.130) Section 7 of this bill requires every candidate to also

22 Under existing law, if it appears that the provisions of law relating to campaign
23 finance have been violated, the Secretary of State may: (1) conduct an investigation
24 concerning the alleged violation and cause the appropriate proceedings to be
25 instituted and prosecuted in the First Judicial District Court; or (2) refer the alleged

29 eliminates provisions relating to instituting any such proceedings in the First
30 Judicial District Court; and (2) authorizes the Office of the Secretary of State to
31 conduct an investigation.

33 relating to campaign finance have been violated to notify the Secretary of State, in
34 writing, of the alleged violation. Under certain circumstances, the Secretary of State
35 may conduct an investigation of the alleged violation. (NRS 294A.410) Section 11
36 provides instead that the Office of the Secretary of State may conduct such an
37 investigation.
38 Existing law authorizes, under certain circumstances, the Secretary of State to
39 cause proceedings to be instituted in the First Judicial District Court to recover
40 certain civil penalties for certain violations of provisions relating to campaign
41 finance. (NRS 294A.420) Section 12 of this bill provides instead that the Secretary
42 of State may, after notice and a hearing, impose certain administrative fines for
43 certain violations relating to campaign finance.
44 Section 4.5 of this bill sets forth certain powers and duties of the Secretary of
45 State or certain officers or employees designated by the Secretary of State relating
46 to investigations or proceedings relating to campaign finance.
47 Sections 12 and 13.5 of this bill authorize the Secretary of State, for good
48 cause, to reduce certain administrative fines and civil penalties relating to campaign
49 finance and statements of financial disclosure. Sections 12 and 13.5 also: (1)
50 authorize the Secretary of State to enter into payment agreements relating to
51 administrative fines and civil penalties; and (2) require the Secretary of State to
52 maintain on the Internet website of the Office of the Secretary of State a list of
53 persons who have not paid within 90 days any such administrative fine or civil
54 penalty. Section 10.5 of this bill makes a conforming change to provide that the
