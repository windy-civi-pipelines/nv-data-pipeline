5 number of candidates for the office at the primary or general election.

6 Section 2.5 of this bill: (1) establishes a contribution limit of $5,000 for a
7 special election that is not a special election to recall a public officer; and (2) sets
8 forth the period during which such contributions may be made, solicited or
9 accepted.
10 Existing law provides that, except in certain circumstances, certain corporations
11 and business organizations as well as labor unions are excluded from the definition
12 of a “committee for political action.” (NRS 294A.0055) Section 6.3 of this bill
13 revises the definition of a “committee for political action” to remove such
14 exceptions, thereby excluding such entities from being considered a committee for
15 political action under any circumstances.
16 Existing law requires certain persons, committees for political action and
17 political parties to report certain independent expenditures or other expenditures.
18 (NRS 249A.210) Section 10.3 of this bill requires any entity excluded from the
19 definition of “committee for political action” pursuant to section 6.3 that makes
20 certain expenditures in excess of $1,000 to report such expenditures.
21 Under existing law, it is unlawful for: (1) a candidate to spend money received
22 as a contribution for the candidate’s personal use; or (2) a public officer to spend
23 unspent contributions for the public officer’s personal use. (NRS 294A.160)
24 Section 8.5 of this bill clarifies that these provisions do not prohibit a candidate or
25 public officer from using contributions or unspent contributions, as applicable, to
26 pay for any ordinary and necessary expense that is incurred in connection with the
27 duties of a campaign or public office, as applicable.
28 Existing law requires every candidate, not later than 1 week after receiving
29 minimum contributions of $100, to open and maintain a separate account in a
30 financial institution located in the United States for the deposit of any contributions
31 received. (NRS 294A.130) Section 7 of this bill requires every candidate, except a
32 public officer running for reelection, to also file with the Secretary of State a notice
33 of intent to file for candidacy.
34 Under existing law, if it appears that the provisions of law relating to campaign
35 finance have been violated, the Secretary of State may: (1) conduct an investigation
36 concerning the alleged violation and cause the appropriate proceedings to be
37 instituted and prosecuted in the First Judicial District Court; or (2) refer the alleged
38 violation to the Attorney General for investigation. The Attorney General is
39 required to investigate and institute and prosecute the appropriate proceedings in
40 the First Judicial District Court. (NRS 294A.410) Section 11 of this bill: (1)
41 eliminates provisions relating to instituting any such proceedings in the First
42 Judicial District Court; (2) authorizes the Office of the Secretary of State to conduct
43 an investigation; (3) requires a person who receives a notice of an alleged violation
44 to submit a response to the Office of the Secretary of State within 15 calendar days
45 after receiving the notice; and (4) authorizes the Office of the Secretary of State to
46 bring the matter before a hearing officer upon the expiration of such a period of
47 time if the person does not submit such a response.
48 Existing law authorizes a person who believes that any provisions of law
49 relating to campaign finance have been violated to notify the Secretary of State, in
50 writing, of the alleged violation. Under certain circumstances, the Secretary of State
51 may conduct an investigation of the alleged violation. (NRS 294A.410) Section 11
52 provides instead that the Office of the Secretary of State may conduct such an
53 investigation.
54 Existing law authorizes, under certain circumstances, the Secretary of State to
55 cause proceedings to be instituted in the First Judicial District Court to recover
56 certain civil penalties for certain violations of provisions relating to campaign
57 finance. (NRS 294A.420) Section 12 of this bill provides instead that the Secretary
58 of State may, after notice and a hearing, impose certain administrative fines for
59 certain violations relating to campaign finance.

60 Section 4.5 of this bill sets forth certain powers and duties of the Secretary of
61 State or certain officers or employees designated by the Secretary of State relating
62 to investigations or proceedings relating to campaign finance. Section 4.5 also
63 requires the Secretary of State or certain officers or employees designated by the
64 Secretary of State to provide certain notice by certified mail to a person to whom
65 the Secretary of State or such an officer or employee intends to issue a subpoena for
66 certain records.
67 Sections 12 and 13.5 of this bill authorize the Secretary of State, for good
68 cause, to reduce certain administrative fines and civil penalties relating to campaign
69 finance and statements of financial disclosure. Sections 12 and 13.5 also: (1)
70 authorize the Secretary of State to enter into payment agreements relating to
71 administrative fines and civil penalties; and (2) require the Secretary of State to
72 maintain on the Internet website of the Office of the Secretary of State a list of
73 persons who have not paid within 90 days any such administrative fine or civil
74 penalty. Section 10.5 of this bill makes a conforming change to provide that the
