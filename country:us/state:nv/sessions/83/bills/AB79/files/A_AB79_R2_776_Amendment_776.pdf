AN ACT relating to governmental administration; establishing a limit on
contributions to the campaign of a candidate in certain special
elections; requiring, with certain exceptions, a candidate to file a notice
of intent to file for candidacy with the Secretary of State; revising
provisions relating to the personal use of contributions or unspent
contributions; revising provisions relating to the investigation and

corporations and business organizations are not a committee for
political action for purposes of campaign finance requirements;
requiring such entities to report certain expenditures; making various
other changes relating to campaign finance; providing penalties; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth limitations on making, soliciting and accepting a campaign
2 contribution for a primary election, a general election or a special election to recall a public
3 officer. (Nev. Const. Art. 2, § 10; NRS 294A.100, 294A.115) Section 6.5 of this bill clarifies
4 that these limits apply regardless of the number of candidates for the office at the primary or
5 general election.
6 Section 2.5 of this bill: (1) establishes a contribution limit of $5,000 for a special election
7 that is not a special election to recall a public officer; and (2) sets forth the period during
8 which such contributions may be made, solicited or accepted.
9 Existing law provides that, except in certain circumstances, certain corporations and
10 business organizations as well as labor unions are excluded from the definition of a
11 “committee for political action.” (NRS 294A.0055) Section 6.3 of this bill revises the

Senate Amendment No. 776 to Assembly Bill No. 79 Second Reprint Page 4
12 definition of a “committee for political action” to remove such exceptions, thereby excluding
13 such entities from being considered a committee for political action under any circumstances.
14 Existing law requires certain persons, committees for political action and political parties
15 to report certain independent expenditures or other expenditures. (NRS 249A.210) Section
16 10.3 of this bill requires any entity excluded from the definition of “committee for political
17 action” pursuant to section 6.3 that makes certain expenditures in excess of $1,000 to report
18 such expenditures.
19 Under existing law, it is unlawful for: (1) a candidate to spend money received as a
20 contribution for the candidate’s personal use; or (2) a public officer to spend unspent
21 contributions for the public officer’s personal use. (NRS 294A.160) Section 8.5 of this bill
22 clarifies that these provisions do not prohibit a candidate or public officer from using
23 contributions or unspent contributions, as applicable, to pay for any ordinary and necessary
24 expense that is incurred in connection with the duties of a campaign or public office, as
25 applicable.
26 Existing law requires every candidate, not later than 1 week after receiving minimum
27 contributions of $100, to open and maintain a separate account in a financial institution
28 located in the United States for the deposit of any contributions received. (NRS 294A.130)
29 Section 7 of this bill requires every candidate, except a public officer running for reelection,
30 to also file with the Secretary of State a notice of intent to file for candidacy.
31 Under existing law, if it appears that the provisions of law relating to campaign finance
32 have been violated, the Secretary of State may: (1) conduct an investigation concerning the
33 alleged violation and cause the appropriate proceedings to be instituted and prosecuted in the
34 First Judicial District Court; or (2) refer the alleged violation to the Attorney General for
35 investigation. The Attorney General is required to investigate and institute and prosecute the
36 appropriate proceedings in the First Judicial District Court. (NRS 294A.410) Section 11 of
37 this bill: (1) eliminates provisions relating to instituting any such proceedings in the First
38 Judicial District Court; (2) authorizes the Office of the Secretary of State to conduct an
39 investigation; (3) requires a person who receives a notice of an alleged violation to submit a
40 response to the Office of the Secretary of State within 15 calendar days after receiving the
41 notice [;] , subject to certain exceptions; and (4) authorizes the Office of the Secretary of
42 State to bring the matter before a hearing officer upon the expiration of such a period of time
43 if the person does not submit such a response.
44 Existing law authorizes a person who believes that any provisions of law relating to
45 campaign finance have been violated to notify the Secretary of State, in writing, of the alleged
46 violation. Under certain circumstances, the Secretary of State may conduct an investigation of
47 the alleged violation. (NRS 294A.410) Section 11 provides instead that the Office of the
48 Secretary of State may conduct such an investigation.
49 Existing law authorizes, under certain circumstances, the Secretary of State to cause
50 proceedings to be instituted in the First Judicial District Court to recover certain civil penalties
51 for certain violations of provisions relating to campaign finance. (NRS 294A.420) Section 12
52 of this bill provides instead that the Secretary of State may, after notice and a hearing, impose
53 certain administrative fines for certain violations relating to campaign finance.
54 Section 4.5 of this bill sets forth certain powers and duties of the Secretary of State or
55 certain officers or employees designated by the Secretary of State relating to investigations or
56 proceedings relating to campaign finance. Section 4.5 also requires the Secretary of State or
57 certain officers or employees designated by the Secretary of State to provide certain notice by
58 certified mail to a person [to whom] who is the subject of an investigation or proceeding if
59 the Secretary of State or such an officer or employee intends to issue a subpoena for certain
60 records [.] to permit such a person to object to and seek issuance of a protective order
61 against the subpoena.
62 Sections 12 and 13.5 of this bill authorize the Secretary of State, for good cause, to
63 reduce certain administrative fines and civil penalties relating to campaign finance and
64 statements of financial disclosure. Sections 12 and 13.5 also: (1) authorize the Secretary of
65 State to enter into payment agreements relating to administrative fines and civil penalties; and
66 (2) require the Secretary of State to maintain on the Internet website of the Office of the
67 Secretary of State a list of persons who have not paid within 90 days any such administrative
68 fine or civil penalty. Section 10.5 of this bill makes a conforming change to provide that the
69 Secretary of State may impose an administrative fine for certain violations.
