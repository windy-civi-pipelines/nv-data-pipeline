Assembly Amendment No. 380 to Assembly Bill No. 79 Page 4
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth limitations on making, soliciting and accepting a campaign
2 contribution for a primary election, a general election or a special election to recall a
3 public officer. (Nev. Const. Art. 2, § 10; NRS 294A.100, 294A.115) Section 6.5 of this bill
4 clarifies that these limits apply regardless of the number of candidates for the office at
5 the primary or general election.
6 Section 2.5 of this bill: (1) establishes a contribution limit of $5,000 for a special
7 election that is not a special election to recall a public officer; and (2) sets forth the
8 period during which such contributions may be made, solicited or accepted.
9 Under existing law, it is unlawful for : (1) a candidate to spend money received as a
10 contribution for the candidate’s personal use [.] ; or (2) a public officer to spend unspent
11 contributions for the public officer’s personal use. (NRS 294A.160) Section [2] 8.5 of this
12 bill [similarly makes it unlawful for a committee for political action to spend money received
13 as a contribution for the personal use of any person.
14 Under existing law, certain candidates, public officers and former public officers are
15 required to dispose of unspent contributions. Any such candidate, public officer or former
16 public officer is also subject to various reporting requirements for as long as the candidate,
17 public officer or former public officer has unspent contributions. (NRS 294A.160) Section 4
18 of this bill provides that every candidate, public officer or former public officer who is
19 required to dispose of unspent contributions must, in addition to any other requirement, notify
20 the Secretary of State when the candidate, public officer or former public officer has disposed
21 of all unspent contributions.
22 Under existing law, every candidate for office at a primary, general or special election
23 who is elected to that office and received contributions that were not spent or committed for
24 expenditure before the election is required to dispose of the unspent contributions through one
25 or more authorized methods, including using the unspent contributions to pay for expenses
26 related to public office. (NRS 294A.160) Section 3 of this bill authorizes an elected public
27 officer to use unspent contributions to pay for the cost of child care, the care of an elderly
28 parent or the premiums for health insurance if the elected public officer would be unable to
29 afford to pay such costs due to serving in the elected public office. If an elected public officer
30 uses any unspent contributions to pay for such expenses, section 3: (1) deems the cost of such
31 expenses to be an expense related to public office; and (2) requires the elected public officer
32 to report the use of unspent contributions on his or her campaign finance report.
33 Existing law requires a committee for political action to open and maintain a separate
34 account in a financial institution located in the United States for the deposit of any
35 contributions received not later than 1 week after receiving contributions the sum of which, in
36 the aggregate, is $1,000 or more. (NRS 294A.130) Under existing law, certain committees for
37 political action are required to report: (1) each contribution in excess of $1,000 received
38 during a reporting period; and (2) contributions received during a reporting period from a
39 contributor which cumulatively exceed $1,000. (NRS 294A.140) Sections 5 and 8 of this bill
40 require that certain committees for political action also report the balance of the account on
41 the ending date of the reporting period. These requirements are consistent with the
42 requirements for candidates to report the balance of the account at the end of a reporting
43 period. (NRS 294A.130) Sections 9, 10 and 12 of this bill make conforming changes to reflect
44 this new reporting requirement for committees for political action. Section 14 of this bill
45 provides that sections 5 and 8: (1) do not apply to any report of contributions or expenditures
46 that is required to be filed by a committee for political action on or before January 15, 2026;
47 and (2) apply to every report of contributions or expenditures that is required to be filed by a
48 committee for political action after January 15, 2026.
49 Existing law defines a “committee for political action” for purposes of campaign finance
50 law. (NRS 294A.0055) Section 6 of this bill revises this definition to exclude from the
51 definition a nonprofit organization which is recognized as tax exempt pursuant to section
52 501(c)(3) or 501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code.] clarifies that these provisions do not
53 prohibit a candidate or public officer from using contributions or unspent contributions,
54 as applicable, to pay for any ordinary and necessary expense that is incurred in
55 connection with the duties of a campaign or public office, as applicable.
56 Existing law requires every candidate, not later than 1 week after receiving minimum
57 contributions of $100, to open and maintain a separate account in a financial institution
58 located in the United States for the deposit of any contributions received. (NRS 294A.130)
Assembly Amendment No. 380 to Assembly Bill No. 79 Page 5
59 Section 7 of this bill requires every candidate to also file with the Secretary of State a notice
60 of intent to file for candidacy.
61 Under existing law, if it appears that the provisions of law relating to campaign finance
62 have been violated, the Secretary of State may : (1) conduct an investigation concerning the
63 alleged violation [.] and cause the appropriate proceedings to be instituted and
64 prosecuted in the First Judicial District Court; or (2) refer the alleged violation to the
65 Attorney General for investigation. The Attorney General is required to investigate and
66 institute and prosecute the appropriate proceedings in the First Judicial District Court.
67 (NRS 294A.410) Section 11 of this bill [provides that in conducting an investigation of an
68 alleged violation, a candidate or committee for political action must, upon request of the
69 Secretary of State, provide to the Secretary of State information relating to the campaign
70 account of the candidate or committee for political action. Sections 11 and 13 of this bill
71 provide that any account information collected or stored by the Secretary of State is
72 confidential and not a public record.] : (1) eliminates provisions relating to instituting any
73 such proceedings in the First Judicial District Court; and (2) authorizes the Office of the
74 Secretary of State to conduct an investigation.
75 Existing law authorizes a person who believes that any provisions of law relating to
76 campaign finance have been violated to notify the Secretary of State, in writing, of the
77 alleged violation. Under certain circumstances, the Secretary of State may conduct an
78 investigation of the alleged violation. (NRS 294A.410) Section 11 provides instead that
79 the Office of the Secretary of State may conduct such an investigation.
80 Existing law authorizes, under certain circumstances, the Secretary of State to cause
81 proceedings to be instituted in the First Judicial District Court to recover certain civil
82 penalties for certain violations of provisions relating to campaign finance. (NRS
83 294A.420) Section 12 of this bill provides instead that the Secretary of State may, after
84 notice and a hearing, impose certain administrative fines for certain violations relating
85 to campaign finance.
86 Section 4.5 of this bill sets forth certain powers and duties of the Secretary of State
87 or certain officers or employees designated by the Secretary of State relating to
88 investigations or proceedings relating to campaign finance.
89 Sections 12 and 13.5 of this bill authorize the Secretary of State, for good cause, to
90 reduce certain administrative fines and civil penalties relating to campaign finance and
91 statements of financial disclosure. Sections 12 and 13.5 also: (1) authorize the Secretary
92 of State to enter into payment agreements relating to administrative fines and civil
93 penalties; and (2) require the Secretary of State to maintain on the Internet website of
94 the Office of the Secretary of State a list of persons who have not paid within 90 days any
95 such administrative fine or civil penalty. Section 10.5 of this bill makes a conforming
96 change to provide that the Secretary of State may impose an administrative fine for
97 certain violations.

3 and section 2 of chapter 391, Statutes of Nevada 2013 and unless otherwise
4 declared by law to be confidential, all public books and public records of a
5 governmental entity must be open at all times during office hours to inspection by
6 any person, and may be fully copied or an abstract or memorandum may be
7 prepared from those public books and public records. Any such copies, abstracts or
8 memoranda may be used to supply the general public with copies, abstracts or
9 memoranda of the records or may be used in any other way to the advantage of the
10 governmental entity or of the general public. This section does not supersede or in

26 electronic format or by means of an electronic medium if:
27 (a) The public record:
28 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
29 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
30 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by means of an
31 electronic medium would:
32 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
33 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential and that
34 cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from information that is not
35 otherwise confidential.
36 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who has legal
37 custody or control of a public record:
38 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the medium that
39 is requested because the officer, employee or agent has already prepared or would
40 prefer to provide the copy in a different medium.
41 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon request, prepare
42 the copy of the public record and shall not require the person who has requested the

Assembly Amendment No. 380 to Assembly Bill No. 79 Page 4
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth limitations on making, soliciting and accepting a campaign
2 contribution for a primary election, a general election or a special election to recall a
3 public officer. (Nev. Const. Art. 2, § 10; NRS 294A.100, 294A.115) Section 6.5 of this bill
4 clarifies that these limits apply regardless of the number of candidates for the office at
5 the primary or general election.
6 Section 2.5 of this bill: (1) establishes a contribution limit of $5,000 for a special
7 election that is not a special election to recall a public officer; and (2) sets forth the
8 period during which such contributions may be made, solicited or accepted.
9 Under existing law, it is unlawful for : (1) a candidate to spend money received as a
10 contribution for the candidate’s personal use [.] ; or (2) a public officer to spend unspent
11 contributions for the public officer’s personal use. (NRS 294A.160) Section [2] 8.5 of this
12 bill [similarly makes it unlawful for a committee for political action to spend money received
13 as a contribution for the personal use of any person.
14 Under existing law, certain candidates, public officers and former public officers are
15 required to dispose of unspent contributions. Any such candidate, public officer or former
16 public officer is also subject to various reporting requirements for as long as the candidate,
17 public officer or former public officer has unspent contributions. (NRS 294A.160) Section 4
18 of this bill provides that every candidate, public officer or former public officer who is
19 required to dispose of unspent contributions must, in addition to any other requirement, notify
20 the Secretary of State when the candidate, public officer or former public officer has disposed
21 of all unspent contributions.
22 Under existing law, every candidate for office at a primary, general or special election
23 who is elected to that office and received contributions that were not spent or committed for
24 expenditure before the election is required to dispose of the unspent contributions through one
25 or more authorized methods, including using the unspent contributions to pay for expenses
26 related to public office. (NRS 294A.160) Section 3 of this bill authorizes an elected public
27 officer to use unspent contributions to pay for the cost of child care, the care of an elderly
28 parent or the premiums for health insurance if the elected public officer would be unable to
29 afford to pay such costs due to serving in the elected public office. If an elected public officer
30 uses any unspent contributions to pay for such expenses, section 3: (1) deems the cost of such
31 expenses to be an expense related to public office; and (2) requires the elected public officer
32 to report the use of unspent contributions on his or her campaign finance report.
33 Existing law requires a committee for political action to open and maintain a separate
34 account in a financial institution located in the United States for the deposit of any
35 contributions received not later than 1 week after receiving contributions the sum of which, in
36 the aggregate, is $1,000 or more. (NRS 294A.130) Under existing law, certain committees for
37 political action are required to report: (1) each contribution in excess of $1,000 received
38 during a reporting period; and (2) contributions received during a reporting period from a
39 contributor which cumulatively exceed $1,000. (NRS 294A.140) Sections 5 and 8 of this bill
40 require that certain committees for political action also report the balance of the account on
41 the ending date of the reporting period. These requirements are consistent with the
42 requirements for candidates to report the balance of the account at the end of a reporting
43 period. (NRS 294A.130) Sections 9, 10 and 12 of this bill make conforming changes to reflect
44 this new reporting requirement for committees for political action. Section 14 of this bill
45 provides that sections 5 and 8: (1) do not apply to any report of contributions or expenditures
46 that is required to be filed by a committee for political action on or before January 15, 2026;
47 and (2) apply to every report of contributions or expenditures that is required to be filed by a
48 committee for political action after January 15, 2026.
49 Existing law defines a “committee for political action” for purposes of campaign finance
50 law. (NRS 294A.0055) Section 6 of this bill revises this definition to exclude from the
51 definition a nonprofit organization which is recognized as tax exempt pursuant to section
52 501(c)(3) or 501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code.] clarifies that these provisions do not
53 prohibit a candidate or public officer from using contributions or unspent contributions,
54 as applicable, to pay for any ordinary and necessary expense that is incurred in
55 connection with the duties of a campaign or public office, as applicable.
56 Existing law requires every candidate, not later than 1 week after receiving minimum
57 contributions of $100, to open and maintain a separate account in a financial institution
58 located in the United States for the deposit of any contributions received. (NRS 294A.130)

Assembly Amendment No. 380 to Assembly Bill No. 79 Page 5
59 Section 7 of this bill requires every candidate to also file with the Secretary of State a notice
60 of intent to file for candidacy.
61 Under existing law, if it appears that the provisions of law relating to campaign finance
62 have been violated, the Secretary of State may : (1) conduct an investigation concerning the
63 alleged violation [.] and cause the appropriate proceedings to be instituted and
64 prosecuted in the First Judicial District Court; or (2) refer the alleged violation to the
65 Attorney General for investigation. The Attorney General is required to investigate and
66 institute and prosecute the appropriate proceedings in the First Judicial District Court.
67 (NRS 294A.410) Section 11 of this bill [provides that in conducting an investigation of an
68 alleged violation, a candidate or committee for political action must, upon request of the
69 Secretary of State, provide to the Secretary of State information relating to the campaign
70 account of the candidate or committee for political action. Sections 11 and 13 of this bill
71 provide that any account information collected or stored by the Secretary of State is
72 confidential and not a public record.] : (1) eliminates provisions relating to instituting any
73 such proceedings in the First Judicial District Court; and (2) authorizes the Office of the
74 Secretary of State to conduct an investigation.
75 Existing law authorizes a person who believes that any provisions of law relating to
76 campaign finance have been violated to notify the Secretary of State, in writing, of the
77 alleged violation. Under certain circumstances, the Secretary of State may conduct an
78 investigation of the alleged violation. (NRS 294A.410) Section 11 provides instead that
79 the Office of the Secretary of State may conduct such an investigation.
80 Existing law authorizes, under certain circumstances, the Secretary of State to cause
81 proceedings to be instituted in the First Judicial District Court to recover certain civil
82 penalties for certain violations of provisions relating to campaign finance. (NRS
83 294A.420) Section 12 of this bill provides instead that the Secretary of State may, after
84 notice and a hearing, impose certain administrative fines for certain violations relating
85 to campaign finance.
86 Section 4.5 of this bill sets forth certain powers and duties of the Secretary of State
87 or certain officers or employees designated by the Secretary of State relating to
88 investigations or proceedings relating to campaign finance.
89 Sections 12 and 13.5 of this bill authorize the Secretary of State, for good cause, to
90 reduce certain administrative fines and civil penalties relating to campaign finance and
91 statements of financial disclosure. Sections 12 and 13.5 also: (1) authorize the Secretary
92 of State to enter into payment agreements relating to administrative fines and civil
93 penalties; and (2) require the Secretary of State to maintain on the Internet website of
94 the Office of the Secretary of State a list of persons who have not paid within 90 days any
95 such administrative fine or civil penalty. Section 10.5 of this bill makes a conforming
96 change to provide that the Secretary of State may impose an administrative fine for
97 certain violations.

6 any person, and may be fully copied or an abstract or memorandum may be
7 prepared from those public books and public records. Any such copies, abstracts or

27 (a) The public record:
28 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
29 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
30 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by means of an
31 electronic medium would:
32 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
33 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential and that
34 cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from information that is not
35 otherwise confidential.
36 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who has legal
37 custody or control of a public record:
