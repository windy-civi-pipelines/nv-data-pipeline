Section 21:
3. The Assembly hereby finds and declares that:
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 5 –
(a) The Nevada Constitution invests each House of the
Legislature with certain plenary and exclusive constitutional
powers which may be exercised only by that House and which
cannot be usurped, infringed or impaired by the other House or by
any other branch of Nevada’s State Government. (Heller v.
Legislature, 120 Nev. 456 (2004); Commission on Ethics v. Hardy,
125 Nev. 285 (2009); Mason’s Manual of Legislative Procedure §§
2-3 & 560-564 (2010) (Mason’s Manual))
(b) Article 4, Section 6 of the Nevada Constitution invests each
House with plenary and exclusive constitutional powers to govern,
control and regulate its membership and its internal organization,
affairs and management, expressly providing that: “Each House
shall judge of the qualifications, elections and returns of its own
members, choose its own officers (except the President of the
Senate), determine the rules of its proceedings and may punish its
members for disorderly conduct, and with the concurrence of two
thirds of all the members elected, expel a member.”
(c) In addition to its plenary and exclusive constitutional
powers, each House possesses certain inherent powers of
institutional self-protection and self-preservation to govern,
control and regulate its membership and its internal organization,
affairs and management. (In re Chapman, 166 U.S. 661, 668
(1897); Mason’s Manual § 2; Luther S. Cushing, Elements of the
Law & Practice of Legislative Assemblies § 533 (1856) (Cushing’s
Legislative Assemblies))
(d) The inherent powers of each House are considered “so
essential to the authority of a legislative assembly, that it cannot
well exist without them; and they are consequently entitled to be
regarded as belonging to every such assembly as a necessary
incident.” (Cushing’s Legislative Assemblies § 533)
(e) The inherent powers of each House authorize it to take all
necessary and proper institutional actions that are “recognized by
the common parliamentary law.” (Cushing’s Legislative
Assemblies § 684)
(f) Thus, it is well established that each House is “vested with
all the powers and privileges which are necessary and incidental to
a free and unobstructed exercise of its appropriate functions.
These powers and privileges are derived not from the Constitution;
on the contrary, they arise from the very creation of a legislative
body, and are founded upon the principle of self-preservation.”
(Ex parte McCarthy, 29 Cal. 395, 403 (1866))
The next rule is 20.

III. DECORUM AND DEBATE
Rule No. 20. Points of Order.
If any member, in speaking or otherwise, transgresses the rules
of the Assembly, the Speaker shall, or any member may, call to
order, in which case the member so called to order shall
immediately sit down, unless permitted to explain; and if called to
order by a member, such member shall immediately state the point
of order. If the point of order be sustained by the presiding officer,
the member shall not be allowed to proceed; but if it be not
sustained, then the member shall be permitted to go on. Every
such decision from the presiding officer shall be subject to an
appeal to the House; but no discussion of the question of order
shall be allowed unless an appeal be taken from the decision of the
presiding officer.
Rule No. 21. Portable Electronic Communication Devices.

Section 22:
1. A person who is within the Assembly Chambers shall not
engage in a telephone conversation via the use of a portable
telephone.

2. Before entering the Assembly Chambers, any person who
possesses a portable electronic communication device, such as a
pager or telephone, that emits an audible alert, such as a ringing

character, alleged misconduct, professional competence or

(c) Filed with the Legislative Counsel who shall review the

the Chair of the Committee or, if the Chair is the subject of the

notice of the determination to the individual who filed the
complaint.
(2) Has jurisdiction and an investigation is warranted in

Section 33:

Code of Ethical Standards in the Joint Standing Rules and, in
addition, must determine whether he or she has a conflict of
interest upon any matter in question before the Legislator. In
determining whether the Legislator has such a conflict of interest,
the Legislator should consider whether the independence of
judgment of a reasonable person in his or her situation upon the
matter in question would be materially affected by the
Legislator’s:
(a) Acceptance of a gift or loan;
(b) Private economic interest; or
(c) Commitment to a member of his or her household or
immediate family.
 In interpreting and applying the provisions of this subsection, it

reasonable person in the Legislator’s situation would not be
-

materially affected by the Legislator’s private economic interest or
the Legislator’s commitment to a member of his or her household
or immediate family where the resulting benefit or detriment
accruing to the Legislator, or if the Legislator has a commitment

to any other member of the general business, profession,
occupation or group that is affected by the matter.

the conflict of interest on the record in a meeting of a committee
or on the floor of the Assembly, as applicable. Such a disclosure
must be entered:
(a) If the Legislator makes the disclosure in a meeting of a
committee, in the minutes for that meeting.
(b) If the Legislator makes the disclosure on the floor of the
Assembly, in the Journal.

session of the Legislature, a Legislator has made a general
disclosure of a conflict of interest on the record in a meeting of a
committee or on the floor of the Assembly, the Legislator is not
required to make that general disclosure at length again regarding
the same conflict of interest if, when the matter in question arises
on subsequent occasions, the Legislator makes a reference on the
record to the previous disclosure.

Section 36:
13. In determining whether to abstain from voting upon,
advocating or opposing a matter concerning which a Legislator
has a conflict of interest pursuant to subsection 10, the Legislator
should consider whether:
(a) The conflict impedes his or her independence of judgment;
and
(b) His or her interest is greater than the interests of an entire
class of persons similarly situated.

Section 37:
14. The provisions of this Rule do not under any
circumstances and regardless of any conflict of interest:

legislative measure; or

while requesting or introducing a legislative measure.

Section 38:
15. If a Legislator who is a member of a committee declares
on the record when a vote is to be taken by the committee that he
or she will abstain from voting because of the requirements of this
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 10 –
Rule, the necessary quorum to act upon and the number of votes
necessary to act upon the matter is reduced as though the
Legislator abstaining were not a member of the committee.

Section 39:

govern whether and to what extent a member of the Assembly has
a conflict of interest, should disclose a conflict of interest or
should abstain from voting upon, advocating or opposing a matter
concerning which the member has a conflict of interest pursuant
to subsection 10:
(a) Are exclusive and are the only standards and procedures
that apply to members of the Assembly with regard to such
matters; and

Assembly from the Legislative Code of Ethical Standards in the
Joint Standing Rules.

Rule No. 126. Authorized Use of Remote-Technology Systems
in Exceptional Circumstances.

Section 206:
1. As used in this Rule, “remote-technology system” means
any system or other means of communication that is:
(a) Approved by the Speaker and uses any electronic, digital or
other similar technology to enable a member of the Assembly from
a remote location to attend, participate, vote and take any other
action in any proceedings of the Assembly or the Committee of the
Whole even though the member is not physically present within
the Assembly Chambers or at a meeting of the Committee of the
Whole.
(b) Approved by the chair of a committee, other than the
Committee of the Whole, and uses any electronic, digital or other
similar technology to enable a member of the Assembly from a
remote location to attend, participate, vote and take any other
action in any proceedings of the committee even though the
member is not physically present at a meeting of the committee.

Section 207:
2. Upon request by a member of the Assembly:
(a) The Speaker may authorize the member to use a remote-
technology system to attend, participate, vote and take any other
action in any proceedings of the Assembly or the Committee of the
Whole if the Speaker determines that exceptional circumstances
warrant such use by the member. If the Speaker grants such
authorization, it must be entered in the Journal of the Assembly.
(b) The chair of a committee, other than the Committee of the
Whole, with the approval of the Speaker, may authorize the
member to use a remote-technology system to attend, participate,
vote and take any other action in any proceedings of the
committee if the chair and the Speaker determine that exceptional
circumstances warrant such use by the member. If the chair
grants such authorization, it must be entered in the records of the
committee.

Section 208:
3. If a member of the Assembly uses a remote-technology
system to attend, participate, vote and take any other action in any
proceedings pursuant to this Rule, the member shall be deemed to
be present and in attendance at the proceedings for all purposes.

Section 209:
4. For the purposes of voting in proceedings of:
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 34 –
(a) The Assembly or the Committee of the Whole, the Chief
Clerk of the Assembly, or an authorized assistant, shall call the
roll of each member who is authorized to use a remote-technology
system for the proceedings and, in accordance with the procedures
of the Assembly, cause the member’s vote to be entered into the
record for the purposes of the Journal of the Assembly or the
records of the Committee of the Whole, as applicable.
(b) A committee, other than the Committee of the Whole, the
committee secretary shall call the roll of each member who is
authorized to use a remote-technology system for the proceedings
and, in accordance with the procedures of the committee, cause
the member’s vote to be entered into the record for the purposes of
the records of the committee.

Section 210:
5. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 7 of Assembly
Standing Rule No. 55, this Rule supersedes, takes precedence and
controls over any other rule, provision or principle of law to the
extent of any conflict with this Rule.

Section 211:
6. The Assembly hereby finds and declares that:
(a) The Nevada Constitution invests each House of the
Legislature with certain plenary and exclusive constitutional
powers which may be exercised only by that House and which
cannot be usurped, infringed or impaired by the other House or by
any other branch of Nevada’s State Government. (Heller v.
Legislature, 120 Nev. 456 (2004); Commission on Ethics v. Hardy,
125 Nev. 285 (2009); Mason’s Manual of Legislative Procedure §§
2-3 & 560-564 (2010) (Mason’s Manual))
(b) Section 6 of Article 4 of the Nevada Constitution invests
each House with plenary and exclusive constitutional powers to
determine the rules of its proceedings and to govern, control and
regulate its membership and its internal organization, affairs and
management, expressly providing that: “Each House shall judge
of the qualifications, elections and returns of its own members,
choose its own officers (except the President of the Senate),
determine the rules of its proceedings and may punish its members
for disorderly conduct, and with the concurrence of two thirds of
all the members elected, expel a member.”
(c) In addition to its plenary and exclusive constitutional
powers, each House possesses certain inherent powers of
institutional self-protection and self-preservation to govern,
control and regulate its membership and its internal organization,
affairs and management. (In re Chapman, 166 U.S. 661, 668
(1897); Mason’s Manual § 2; Luther S. Cushing, Elements of the
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 35 –
Law & Practice of Legislative Assemblies § 533 (1856) (Cushing’s
Legislative Assemblies))
(d) The inherent powers of each House are considered “so
essential to the authority of a legislative assembly, that it cannot
well exist without them; and they are consequently entitled to be
regarded as belonging to every such assembly as a necessary
incident.” (Cushing’s Legislative Assemblies § 533)
(e) The inherent powers of each House authorize it to take all
necessary and proper institutional actions that are “recognized by
the common parliamentary law.” (Cushing’s Legislative
Assemblies § 684)
(f) Thus, it is well established that each House is “vested with
all the powers and privileges which are necessary and incidental to
a free and unobstructed exercise of its appropriate functions.
These powers and privileges are derived not from the Constitution;
on the contrary, they arise from the very creation of a legislative
body, and are founded upon the principle of self-preservation.”
(Ex parte McCarthy, 29 Cal. 395, 403 (1866))
(g) Under the Nevada Constitution, there are no constitutional
provisions establishing a particular method for determining
whether a member of either House is present at legislative
proceedings.
(h) The United States Supreme Court has held that when there
are no constitutional provisions establishing a particular method
for determining whether a member of a legislative house is present
at legislative proceedings, “it is therefore within the competency of
the house to prescribe any method which shall be reasonably
certain to ascertain the fact.” (United States v. Ballin, 144 U.S. 1,
6 (1892))
(i) The United States Supreme Court has also held that when a
legislative house adopts a rule establishing a reasonable method
for determining whether a member is present at legislative
proceedings, that rule must be given great deference by the courts
because:
Neither do the advantages or disadvantages, the wisdom or
folly, of such a rule present any matters for judicial
consideration. With the courts the question is only one of
power. The constitution empowers each house to determine
its rules of proceedings. It may not by its rules ignore
constitutional restraints or violate fundamental rights, and
there should be a reasonable relation between the mode or
method of proceeding established by the rule and the result
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 36 –
which is sought to be attained. But within these limitations
all matters of method are open to the determination of the
house, and it is no impeachment of the rule to say that some
other way would be better, more accurate, or even more just.
It is no objection to the validity of a rule that a different one
has been prescribed and in force for a length of time. The
power to make rules is not one which once exercised is
exhausted. It is a continuous power, always subject to be
exercised by the house, and, within the limitations
suggested, absolute and beyond the challenge of any other
body or tribunal.
(United States v. Ballin, 144 U.S. 1, 5 (1892))

Section 212:
7. The Assembly hereby exercises its constitutional and
inherent powers and privileges and adopts this Rule to:
(a) Govern, control and regulate its membership and its
internal organization, affairs and management;
(b) Ensure its institutional self-protection and self-
preservation; and
(c) Establish a reasonable method for determining whether a
member of the Assembly is present at legislative proceedings
during exceptional circumstances.

Rule No. 4. Reserved.
Rule No. 5. Reserved.
Rule No. 6. Reserved.
The next rule is 10.
II. SESSIONS AND MEETINGS
Rule No. 10. Time of Meeting.
The Assembly shall meet each day at 11:30 a.m., unless the
Assembly adjourns to some other hour.
Rule No. 11. Open Meetings.
All meetings of the Assembly and its committees must be open
to the public.
Rule No. 12. Convening of the Assembly between Legislative
Sessions.
1. The Assembly may be convened at any time between
sessions of the Legislature upon a petition signed by a majority of
the members elected to the Assembly to consider and take action
on any matter that is solely and exclusively within the
constitutional or inherent powers of the Assembly, including,
without limitation, any matter that may be considered and acted
on by the Assembly pursuant to its plenary and exclusive
constitutional powers under Article 4, Section 6 of the Nevada
Constitution or pursuant to its inherent powers of institutional
self-protection and self-preservation to govern, control and
regulate its membership and its internal organization, affairs and
management.
2. A petition convening the Assembly pursuant to this Rule
must specify the matter that will be considered or acted on by the
Assembly, indicate a date for the Assembly to convene and be
transmitted to the Chief Clerk of the Assembly. Upon receipt of
one or more substantially similar petitions signed, in the
aggregate, by a majority of the members elected to the Assembly,
the Chief Clerk shall notify all members of the Assembly that the
Assembly will be convened pursuant to this Rule and the date on
which the Assembly will be convened.
3. The Assembly hereby finds and declares that:
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 5 –
(a) The Nevada Constitution invests each House of the
Legislature with certain plenary and exclusive constitutional
powers which may be exercised only by that House and which
cannot be usurped, infringed or impaired by the other House or by
any other branch of Nevada’s State Government. (Heller v.
Legislature, 120 Nev. 456 (2004); Commission on Ethics v. Hardy,
125 Nev. 285 (2009); Mason’s Manual of Legislative Procedure §§
2-3 & 560-564 (2010) (Mason’s Manual))
(b) Article 4, Section 6 of the Nevada Constitution invests each
House with plenary and exclusive constitutional powers to govern,
control and regulate its membership and its internal organization,
affairs and management, expressly providing that: “Each House
shall judge of the qualifications, elections and returns of its own
members, choose its own officers (except the President of the
Senate), determine the rules of its proceedings and may punish its
members for disorderly conduct, and with the concurrence of two
thirds of all the members elected, expel a member.”
(c) In addition to its plenary and exclusive constitutional
powers, each House possesses certain inherent powers of
institutional self-protection and self-preservation to govern,
control and regulate its membership and its internal organization,
affairs and management. (In re Chapman, 166 U.S. 661, 668
(1897); Mason’s Manual § 2; Luther S. Cushing, Elements of the
Law & Practice of Legislative Assemblies § 533 (1856) (Cushing’s
Legislative Assemblies))
(d) The inherent powers of each House are considered “so
essential to the authority of a legislative assembly, that it cannot
well exist without them; and they are consequently entitled to be
regarded as belonging to every such assembly as a necessary
incident.” (Cushing’s Legislative Assemblies § 533)
(e) The inherent powers of each House authorize it to take all
necessary and proper institutional actions that are “recognized by
the common parliamentary law.” (Cushing’s Legislative
Assemblies § 684)
(f) Thus, it is well established that each House is “vested with
all the powers and privileges which are necessary and incidental to
a free and unobstructed exercise of its appropriate functions.
These powers and privileges are derived not from the Constitution;
on the contrary, they arise from the very creation of a legislative
body, and are founded upon the principle of self-preservation.”
(Ex parte McCarthy, 29 Cal. 395, 403 (1866))
The next rule is 20.

83rd Session (2025)

III. DECORUM AND DEBATE
Rule No. 20. Points of Order.
If any member, in speaking or otherwise, transgresses the rules
of the Assembly, the Speaker shall, or any member may, call to
order, in which case the member so called to order shall
immediately sit down, unless permitted to explain; and if called to
order by a member, such member shall immediately state the point
of order. If the point of order be sustained by the presiding officer,
the member shall not be allowed to proceed; but if it be not
sustained, then the member shall be permitted to go on. Every
such decision from the presiding officer shall be subject to an
appeal to the House; but no discussion of the question of order
shall be allowed unless an appeal be taken from the decision of the
presiding officer.
Rule No. 21. Portable Electronic Communication Devices.
1. A person who is within the Assembly Chambers shall not
engage in a telephone conversation via the use of a portable
telephone.
2. Before entering the Assembly Chambers, any person who
possesses a portable electronic communication device, such as a
pager or telephone, that emits an audible alert, such as a ringing
or beeping sound, to signal an incoming message or call, shall
turn the audible alert off. A device that contains a nonaudible
alert, such as a silent vibration, may be operated in a nonaudible
manner within the Assembly Chambers.
Rule No. 22. Reserved.
Rule No. 23. Select Committee on Ethics; Legislative Ethics.
1. The Select Committee on Ethics consists of:
(a) Two members of the Assembly appointed by the Speaker
from the majority political party;
(b) One member of the Assembly appointed by the Minority
Leader from the minority political party; and
(c) Three qualified electors of the State, two of whom are
appointed by the Speaker and one who is appointed by the
Minority Leader, and none of whom is a present member of the
Legislature or employed by the State of Nevada.
2. The Speaker shall appoint the Chair and Vice Chair of the
Committee. The Vice Chair shall serve as the acting Chair if the
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 7 –
Chair is unable to serve for any reason during the consideration
of a specific question.
3. The Speaker shall appoint an alternate member with the
qualifications set forth in paragraph (a) of subsection 1 and an
alternate member with the qualifications set forth in paragraph (c)
of subsection 1. The Minority Leader shall appoint an alternate
member with the qualifications set forth in paragraph (b) of
subsection 1 and an alternate member with the qualifications set
forth in paragraph (c) of subsection 1. If a member of the
Committee is unable to serve for any reason during the
consideration of a specific question, the alternate appointed with
the qualifications from the same paragraph in subsection 1 shall
serve as a member of the Committee during the consideration of
the specific question.
4. A member of the Committee is disqualified to serve during
the consideration of a specific question if:
(a) The member is the requester of advice concerning the
question of ethics or conflict of interest, or the member is the
subject of the complaint concerning the specific question; or
(b) A reasonable person in the member’s situation could not
exercise independent judgment on the matter in question.
5. The members of the Committee shall perform any duty
required in the period between the time of their appointment after
the general election and the organization of the next succeeding
regular session, or until the Speaker or the Speaker Designate or
the Minority Leader or Minority Leader Designate appoint new
members to the Committee, whichever occurs first.
6. The tenure of the members of the Committee shall extend
during the interim between regular sessions of the Legislature.
7. The Committee:
(a) May hear requests brought by members of the Assembly for
advice on specific questions of potential breaches of ethics and
conflicts of interest; and
(b) Shall hear complaints brought by members of the Assembly
and others on specific questions of alleged breaches of ethics and
conflicts of interest, including, without limitation, alleged
breaches of the Legislative Code of Ethical Standards in the Joint
Standing Rules.
8. All proceedings held by the Committee to consider the
character, alleged misconduct, professional competence or
physical or mental health of any person on matters of ethics or
conflicts of interest and all materials related to those proceedings
are confidential, unless the person who is the subject of the
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 8 –
proceedings requests a public hearing or discloses the content of
the proceedings or materials.
9. An individual may file a complaint which alleges a breach
of ethics or a conflict of interest, including, without limitation, an
alleged breach of the Legislative Code of Ethical Standards in the
Joint Standing Rules. If the alleged breach of ethics or conflict of
interest involves the conduct of more than one person, separate
complaints must be filed regarding each person. A complaint must
be:
(a) Made in writing on a form provided by the Legislative
Counsel;
(b) Signed and verified under penalty of perjury by the
individual making the allegation; and
(c) Filed with the Legislative Counsel who shall review the
complaint and any other relevant information and consult with
the Chair of the Committee or, if the Chair is the subject of the
complaint, with the Vice Chair, to evaluate whether the Committee
has jurisdiction and whether an investigation is warranted in the
matter. If it is determined that the Committee:
(1) Does not have jurisdiction or that an investigation is not
warranted in the matter, the Legislative Counsel shall send written
notice of the determination to the individual who filed the
complaint.
(2) Has jurisdiction and an investigation is warranted in
the matter, the Legislative Counsel shall send written notice of the
determination and a copy of the complaint to the person who is the
subject of the complaint.
10. Each Legislator is subject, at all times, to the Legislative
Code of Ethical Standards in the Joint Standing Rules and, in
addition, must determine whether he or she has a conflict of
interest upon any matter in question before the Legislator. In
determining whether the Legislator has such a conflict of interest,
the Legislator should consider whether the independence of
judgment of a reasonable person in his or her situation upon the
matter in question would be materially affected by the
Legislator’s:
(a) Acceptance of a gift or loan;
(b) Private economic interest; or
(c) Commitment to a member of his or her household or
immediate family.
 In interpreting and applying the provisions of this subsection, it
must be presumed that the independence of judgment of a
reasonable person in the Legislator’s situation would not be
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 9 –
materially affected by the Legislator’s private economic interest or
the Legislator’s commitment to a member of his or her household
or immediate family where the resulting benefit or detriment
accruing to the Legislator, or if the Legislator has a commitment
to a member of his or her household or immediate family,
accruing to those other persons, is not greater than that accruing
to any other member of the general business, profession,
occupation or group that is affected by the matter.
11. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 12, if a
Legislator knows he or she has a conflict of interest pursuant to
subsection 10, the Legislator shall make a general disclosure of
the conflict of interest on the record in a meeting of a committee
or on the floor of the Assembly, as applicable. Such a disclosure
must be entered:
(a) If the Legislator makes the disclosure in a meeting of a
committee, in the minutes for that meeting.
(b) If the Legislator makes the disclosure on the floor of the
Assembly, in the Journal.
12. If, on one or more prior occasions during the current
session of the Legislature, a Legislator has made a general
disclosure of a conflict of interest on the record in a meeting of a
committee or on the floor of the Assembly, the Legislator is not
required to make that general disclosure at length again regarding
the same conflict of interest if, when the matter in question arises
on subsequent occasions, the Legislator makes a reference on the
record to the previous disclosure.
13. In determining whether to abstain from voting upon,
advocating or opposing a matter concerning which a Legislator
has a conflict of interest pursuant to subsection 10, the Legislator
should consider whether:
(a) The conflict impedes his or her independence of judgment;
and
(b) His or her interest is greater than the interests of an entire
class of persons similarly situated.
14. The provisions of this Rule do not under any
circumstances and regardless of any conflict of interest:
(a) Prohibit a Legislator from requesting or introducing a
legislative measure; or
(b) Require a Legislator to take any particular action before or
while requesting or introducing a legislative measure.
15. If a Legislator who is a member of a committee declares
on the record when a vote is to be taken by the committee that he
or she will abstain from voting because of the requirements of this
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 10 –
Rule, the necessary quorum to act upon and the number of votes
necessary to act upon the matter is reduced as though the
Legislator abstaining were not a member of the committee.
16. The standards and procedures set forth in this Rule which
govern whether and to what extent a member of the Assembly has
a conflict of interest, should disclose a conflict of interest or
should abstain from voting upon, advocating or opposing a matter
concerning which the member has a conflict of interest pursuant
to subsection 10:
(a) Are exclusive and are the only standards and procedures
that apply to members of the Assembly with regard to such
matters; and
(b) Supersede and preempt all other standards and procedures
with regard to such matters,
 except that this subsection does not exempt any members of the
Assembly from the Legislative Code of Ethical Standards in the
Joint Standing Rules.
17. For purposes of this Rule, “immediate family” means a
person who is related to the Legislator by blood, adoption or
marriage within the first degree of consanguinity or affinity.
The next rule is 30.
IV. QUORUM, VOTING, ELECTIONS
Rule No. 30. Manner of Voting.
1. The presiding officer shall declare all votes, but the yeas
and nays must be taken when called for by three members present,
and the names of those calling for the yeas and nays must be

2. The presiding officer shall call for yeas and nays by a
division or by a roll call, either electronic or oral.
3. When taking the yeas and nays on any proposal, the

Rule No. 126. Authorized Use of Remote-Technology Systems
in Exceptional Circumstances.
1. As used in this Rule, “remote-technology system” means
any system or other means of communication that is:
(a) Approved by the Speaker and uses any electronic, digital or
other similar technology to enable a member of the Assembly from
a remote location to attend, participate, vote and take any other
action in any proceedings of the Assembly or the Committee of the
Whole even though the member is not physically present within
the Assembly Chambers or at a meeting of the Committee of the
Whole.
(b) Approved by the chair of a committee, other than the
Committee of the Whole, and uses any electronic, digital or other
similar technology to enable a member of the Assembly from a
remote location to attend, participate, vote and take any other
action in any proceedings of the committee even though the
member is not physically present at a meeting of the committee.
2. Upon request by a member of the Assembly:
(a) The Speaker may authorize the member to use a remote-
technology system to attend, participate, vote and take any other
action in any proceedings of the Assembly or the Committee of the
Whole if the Speaker determines that exceptional circumstances
warrant such use by the member. If the Speaker grants such
authorization, it must be entered in the Journal of the Assembly.
(b) The chair of a committee, other than the Committee of the
Whole, with the approval of the Speaker, may authorize the
member to use a remote-technology system to attend, participate,
vote and take any other action in any proceedings of the
committee if the chair and the Speaker determine that exceptional
circumstances warrant such use by the member. If the chair
grants such authorization, it must be entered in the records of the
committee.
3. If a member of the Assembly uses a remote-technology
system to attend, participate, vote and take any other action in any
proceedings pursuant to this Rule, the member shall be deemed to
be present and in attendance at the proceedings for all purposes.
4. For the purposes of voting in proceedings of:
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 34 –
(a) The Assembly or the Committee of the Whole, the Chief
Clerk of the Assembly, or an authorized assistant, shall call the
roll of each member who is authorized to use a remote-technology
system for the proceedings and, in accordance with the procedures
of the Assembly, cause the member’s vote to be entered into the
record for the purposes of the Journal of the Assembly or the
records of the Committee of the Whole, as applicable.
(b) A committee, other than the Committee of the Whole, the
committee secretary shall call the roll of each member who is
authorized to use a remote-technology system for the proceedings
and, in accordance with the procedures of the committee, cause
the member’s vote to be entered into the record for the purposes of
the records of the committee.
5. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 7 of Assembly
Standing Rule No. 55, this Rule supersedes, takes precedence and
controls over any other rule, provision or principle of law to the
extent of any conflict with this Rule.
6. The Assembly hereby finds and declares that:
(a) The Nevada Constitution invests each House of the
Legislature with certain plenary and exclusive constitutional
powers which may be exercised only by that House and which
cannot be usurped, infringed or impaired by the other House or by
any other branch of Nevada’s State Government. (Heller v.
Legislature, 120 Nev. 456 (2004); Commission on Ethics v. Hardy,
125 Nev. 285 (2009); Mason’s Manual of Legislative Procedure §§
2-3 & 560-564 (2010) (Mason’s Manual))
(b) Section 6 of Article 4 of the Nevada Constitution invests
each House with plenary and exclusive constitutional powers to
determine the rules of its proceedings and to govern, control and
regulate its membership and its internal organization, affairs and
management, expressly providing that: “Each House shall judge
of the qualifications, elections and returns of its own members,
choose its own officers (except the President of the Senate),
determine the rules of its proceedings and may punish its members
for disorderly conduct, and with the concurrence of two thirds of
all the members elected, expel a member.”
(c) In addition to its plenary and exclusive constitutional
powers, each House possesses certain inherent powers of
institutional self-protection and self-preservation to govern,
control and regulate its membership and its internal organization,
affairs and management. (In re Chapman, 166 U.S. 661, 668
(1897); Mason’s Manual § 2; Luther S. Cushing, Elements of the
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 35 –
Law & Practice of Legislative Assemblies § 533 (1856) (Cushing’s
Legislative Assemblies))
(d) The inherent powers of each House are considered “so
essential to the authority of a legislative assembly, that it cannot
well exist without them; and they are consequently entitled to be
regarded as belonging to every such assembly as a necessary
incident.” (Cushing’s Legislative Assemblies § 533)
(e) The inherent powers of each House authorize it to take all
necessary and proper institutional actions that are “recognized by
the common parliamentary law.” (Cushing’s Legislative
Assemblies § 684)
(f) Thus, it is well established that each House is “vested with
all the powers and privileges which are necessary and incidental to
a free and unobstructed exercise of its appropriate functions.
These powers and privileges are derived not from the Constitution;
on the contrary, they arise from the very creation of a legislative
body, and are founded upon the principle of self-preservation.”
(Ex parte McCarthy, 29 Cal. 395, 403 (1866))
(g) Under the Nevada Constitution, there are no constitutional
provisions establishing a particular method for determining
whether a member of either House is present at legislative
proceedings.
(h) The United States Supreme Court has held that when there
are no constitutional provisions establishing a particular method
for determining whether a member of a legislative house is present
at legislative proceedings, “it is therefore within the competency of
the house to prescribe any method which shall be reasonably
certain to ascertain the fact.” (United States v. Ballin, 144 U.S. 1,
6 (1892))
(i) The United States Supreme Court has also held that when a
legislative house adopts a rule establishing a reasonable method
for determining whether a member is present at legislative
proceedings, that rule must be given great deference by the courts
because:
Neither do the advantages or disadvantages, the wisdom or
folly, of such a rule present any matters for judicial
consideration. With the courts the question is only one of
power. The constitution empowers each house to determine
its rules of proceedings. It may not by its rules ignore
constitutional restraints or violate fundamental rights, and
there should be a reasonable relation between the mode or
method of proceeding established by the rule and the result
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 36 –
which is sought to be attained. But within these limitations
all matters of method are open to the determination of the
house, and it is no impeachment of the rule to say that some
other way would be better, more accurate, or even more just.
It is no objection to the validity of a rule that a different one
has been prescribed and in force for a length of time. The
power to make rules is not one which once exercised is
exhausted. It is a continuous power, always subject to be
exercised by the house, and, within the limitations
suggested, absolute and beyond the challenge of any other
body or tribunal.
(United States v. Ballin, 144 U.S. 1, 5 (1892))
7. The Assembly hereby exercises its constitutional and
inherent powers and privileges and adopts this Rule to:
(a) Govern, control and regulate its membership and its
internal organization, affairs and management;
(b) Ensure its institutional self-protection and self-
preservation; and
(c) Establish a reasonable method for determining whether a
member of the Assembly is present at legislative proceedings
during exceptional circumstances.

Assembly.
