24

27 1. The Assembly may be convened at any time between
28 sessions of the Legislature upon a petition signed by a majority of
29 the members elected to the Assembly to consider and take action
30 on any matter that is solely and exclusively within the
31 constitutional or inherent powers of the Assembly, including,
32 without limitation, any matter that may be considered and acted
33 on by the Assembly pursuant to its plenary and exclusive
34 constitutional powers under Article 4, Section 6 of the Nevada
35 Constitution or pursuant to its inherent powers of institutional
36 self-protection and self-preservation to govern, control and
37 regulate its membership and its internal organization, affairs and
38 management.
39 2. A petition convening the Assembly pursuant to this Rule
40 must specify the matter that will be considered or acted on by the
41 Assembly, indicate a date for the Assembly to convene and be

45 the Chief Clerk shall notify all members of the Assembly that the
-
*AR1*

– 5 –
1 Assembly will be convened pursuant to this Rule and the date on
2 which the Assembly will be convened.
3 3. The Assembly hereby finds and declares that:
4 (a) The Nevada Constitution invests each House of the
5 Legislature with certain plenary and exclusive constitutional
6 powers which may be exercised only by that House and which
7 cannot be usurped, infringed or impaired by the other House or by
8 any other branch of Nevada’s State Government. (Heller v.
9 Legislature, 120 Nev. 456 (2004); Commission on Ethics v. Hardy,
10 125 Nev. 285 (2009); Mason’s Manual of Legislative Procedure §§
11 2-3 & 560-564 (2010) (Mason’s Manual))
12 (b) Article 4, Section 6 of the Nevada Constitution invests each
13 House with plenary and exclusive constitutional powers to govern,
14 control and regulate its membership and its internal organization,
15 affairs and management, expressly providing that: “Each House
16 shall judge of the qualifications, elections and returns of its own
17 members, choose its own officers (except the President of the
18 Senate), determine the rules of its proceedings and may punish its
19 members for disorderly conduct, and with the concurrence of two
20 thirds of all the members elected, expel a member.”
21 (c) In addition to its plenary and exclusive constitutional
22 powers, each House possesses certain inherent powers of
23 institutional self-protection and self-preservation to govern,
24 control and regulate its membership and its internal organization,
25 affairs and management. (In re Chapman, 166 U.S. 661, 668
26 (1897); Mason’s Manual § 2; Luther S. Cushing, Elements of the
27 Law & Practice of Legislative Assemblies § 533 (1856) (Cushing’s
28 Legislative Assemblies))
29 (d) The inherent powers of each House are considered “so
30 essential to the authority of a legislative assembly, that it cannot
31 well exist without them; and they are consequently entitled to be
32 regarded as belonging to every such assembly as a necessary
33 incident.” (Cushing’s Legislative Assemblies § 533)
34 (e) The inherent powers of each House authorize it to take all
35 necessary and proper institutional actions that are “recognized by
36 the common parliamentary law.” (Cushing’s Legislative
37 Assemblies § 684)
38 (f) Thus, it is well established that each House is “vested with
39 all the powers and privileges which are necessary and incidental to
40 a free and unobstructed exercise of its appropriate functions.
41 These powers and privileges are derived not from the Constitution;
42 on the contrary, they arise from the very creation of a legislative
43 body, and are founded upon the principle of self-preservation.”

5 Rule No. 20. Points of Order.
6 If any member, in speaking or otherwise, transgresses the rules
7 of the Assembly, the Speaker shall, or any member may, call to
8 order, in which case the member so called to order shall
9 immediately sit down, unless permitted to explain; and if called to
10 order by a member, such member shall immediately state the point
11 of order. If the point of order be sustained by the presiding officer,
12 the member shall not be allowed to proceed; but if it be not
13 sustained, then the member shall be permitted to go on. Every
14 such decision from the presiding officer shall be subject to an
15 appeal to the House; but no discussion of the question of order
16 shall be allowed unless an appeal be taken from the decision of the
17 presiding officer.
18
19 Rule No. 21. Portable Electronic Communication Devices.
20 1. A person who is within the Assembly Chambers shall not
21 engage in a telephone conversation via the use of a portable
22 telephone.
23 2. Before entering the Assembly Chambers, any person who
24 possesses a portable electronic communication device, such as a
25 pager or telephone, that emits an audible alert, such as a ringing
26 or beeping sound, to signal an incoming message or call, shall
27 turn the audible alert off. A device that contains a nonaudible
28 alert, such as a silent vibration, may be operated in a nonaudible
29 manner within the Assembly Chambers.

36 from the majority political party;
37 (b) One member of the Assembly appointed by the Minority

6 of subsection 1. The Minority Leader shall appoint an alternate
7 member with the qualifications set forth in paragraph (b) of
8 subsection 1 and an alternate member with the qualifications set
9 forth in paragraph (c) of subsection 1. If a member of the
10 Committee is unable to serve for any reason during the
11 consideration of a specific question, the alternate appointed with
12 the qualifications from the same paragraph in subsection 1 shall
13 serve as a member of the Committee during the consideration of
14 the specific question.
15 4. A member of the Committee is disqualified to serve during
16 the consideration of a specific question if:
17 (a) The member is the requester of advice concerning the
18 question of ethics or conflict of interest, or the member is the
19 subject of the complaint concerning the specific question; or
20 (b) A reasonable person in the member’s situation could not
21 exercise independent judgment on the matter in question.
22 5. The members of the Committee shall perform any duty
23 required in the period between the time of their appointment after
24 the general election and the organization of the next succeeding
25 regular session, or until the Speaker or the Speaker Designate or
26 the Minority Leader or Minority Leader Designate appoint new
27 members to the Committee, whichever occurs first.
28 6. The tenure of the members of the Committee shall extend
29 during the interim between regular sessions of the Legislature.
30 7. The Committee:
31 (a) May hear requests brought by members of the Assembly for
32 advice on specific questions of potential breaches of ethics and
33 conflicts of interest; and
34 (b) Shall hear complaints brought by members of the Assembly
35 and others on specific questions of alleged breaches of ethics and
36 conflicts of interest, including, without limitation, alleged
37 breaches of the Legislative Code of Ethical Standards in the Joint
38 Standing Rules.
39 8. All proceedings held by the Committee to consider the
40 character, alleged misconduct, professional competence or
41 physical or mental health of any person on matters of ethics or
42 conflicts of interest and all materials related to those proceedings
43 are confidential, unless the person who is the subject of the
44 proceedings requests a public hearing or discloses the content of
45 the proceedings or materials.
-
*AR1*

– 8 –
1 9. An individual may file a complaint which alleges a breach
2 of ethics or a conflict of interest, including, without limitation, an
3 alleged breach of the Legislative Code of Ethical Standards in the
4 Joint Standing Rules. If the alleged breach of ethics or conflict of
5 interest involves the conduct of more than one person, separate
6 complaints must be filed regarding each person. A complaint must
7 be:
8 (a) Made in writing on a form provided by the Legislative
9 Counsel;
10 (b) Signed and verified under penalty of perjury by the
11 individual making the allegation; and
12 (c) Filed with the Legislative Counsel who shall review the
13 complaint and any other relevant information and consult with
14 the Chair of the Committee or, if the Chair is the subject of the
15 complaint, with the Vice Chair, to evaluate whether the Committee
16 has jurisdiction and whether an investigation is warranted in the
17 matter. If it is determined that the Committee:
18 (1) Does not have jurisdiction or that an investigation is not
19 warranted in the matter, the Legislative Counsel shall send written
20 notice of the determination to the individual who filed the
21 complaint.
22 (2) Has jurisdiction and an investigation is warranted in
23 the matter, the Legislative Counsel shall send written notice of the
24 determination and a copy of the complaint to the person who is the
25 subject of the complaint.
26 10. Each Legislator is subject, at all times, to the Legislative
27 Code of Ethical Standards in the Joint Standing Rules and, in
28 addition, must determine whether he or she has a conflict of
29 interest upon any matter in question before the Legislator. In
30 determining whether the Legislator has such a conflict of interest,
31 the Legislator should consider whether the independence of
32 judgment of a reasonable person in his or her situation upon the
33 matter in question would be materially affected by the
34 Legislator’s:
35 (a) Acceptance of a gift or loan;
36 (b) Private economic interest; or
37 (c) Commitment to a member of his or her household or
38 immediate family.
39  In interpreting and applying the provisions of this subsection, it
40 must be presumed that the independence of judgment of a
41 reasonable person in the Legislator’s situation would not be
42 materially affected by the Legislator’s private economic interest or
43 the Legislator’s commitment to a member of his or her household
44 or immediate family where the resulting benefit or detriment
45 accruing to the Legislator, or if the Legislator has a commitment
-
*AR1*

– 9 –
1 to a member of his or her household or immediate family,
2 accruing to those other persons, is not greater than that accruing
3 to any other member of the general business, profession,
4 occupation or group that is affected by the matter.
5 11. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 12, if a
6 Legislator knows he or she has a conflict of interest pursuant to
7 subsection 10, the Legislator shall make a general disclosure of
8 the conflict of interest on the record in a meeting of a committee
9 or on the floor of the Assembly, as applicable. Such a disclosure
10 must be entered:
11 (a) If the Legislator makes the disclosure in a meeting of a
12 committee, in the minutes for that meeting.
13 (b) If the Legislator makes the disclosure on the floor of the
14 Assembly, in the Journal.
15 12. If, on one or more prior occasions during the current
16 session of the Legislature, a Legislator has made a general
17 disclosure of a conflict of interest on the record in a meeting of a
18 committee or on the floor of the Assembly, the Legislator is not
19 required to make that general disclosure at length again regarding
20 the same conflict of interest if, when the matter in question arises
21 on subsequent occasions, the Legislator makes a reference on the
22 record to the previous disclosure.
23 13. In determining whether to abstain from voting upon,
24 advocating or opposing a matter concerning which a Legislator
25 has a conflict of interest pursuant to subsection 10, the Legislator
26 should consider whether:
27 (a) The conflict impedes his or her independence of judgment;
28 and
29 (b) His or her interest is greater than the interests of an entire
30 class of persons similarly situated.
31 14. The provisions of this Rule do not under any
32 circumstances and regardless of any conflict of interest:
33 (a) Prohibit a Legislator from requesting or introducing a
34 legislative measure; or
35 (b) Require a Legislator to take any particular action before or
36 while requesting or introducing a legislative measure.
37 15. If a Legislator who is a member of a committee declares
38 on the record when a vote is to be taken by the committee that he
39 or she will abstain from voting because of the requirements of this
40 Rule, the necessary quorum to act upon and the number of votes
41 necessary to act upon the matter is reduced as though the
42 Legislator abstaining were not a member of the committee.
43 16. The standards and procedures set forth in this Rule which
44 govern whether and to what extent a member of the Assembly has
45 a conflict of interest, should disclose a conflict of interest or
-
*AR1*

– 10 –
1 should abstain from voting upon, advocating or opposing a matter
2 concerning which the member has a conflict of interest pursuant
3 to subsection 10:
4 (a) Are exclusive and are the only standards and procedures
5 that apply to members of the Assembly with regard to such
6 matters; and
7 (b) Supersede and preempt all other standards and procedures
8 with regard to such matters,
9  except that this subsection does not exempt any members of the
10 Assembly from the Legislative Code of Ethical Standards in the
11 Joint Standing Rules.
12 17. For purposes of this Rule, “immediate family” means a
13 person who is related to the Legislator by blood, adoption or
14 marriage within the first degree of consanguinity or affinity.

15 pursuant to NRS 293.427, the Speaker shall appoint a committee
16 to review the contest and designate the chair and vice chair of the
17 committee. The committee must consist of three members who are
18 not parties to the contest.

30 the committee in making its determination, the chair shall take,
31 direct or require any reasonable actions to provide the parties with
32 notice and an opportunity to submit written arguments to the
33 committee limited to the issue of whether the contestant complied
34 with all requirements to bring and maintain the contest.
35 5. If the committee determines that the contestant complied

40 the committee shall report to the Assembly its recommendation
41 that the Assembly should not take further action on the contest
42 and that the Assembly should dismiss the contest with prejudice.
43 As soon as practicable after receiving the committee’s report, the

45 recommendation without amendment. If the Assembly accepts the

6 directions to review the merits of the contest pursuant to this Rule.
7 6. If the committee reviews the merits of the contest pursuant
8 to this Rule, the committee may conduct any reasonable hearings
9 or other proceedings to receive any evidence and arguments from
10 the parties regarding the merits of the contest. The committee
11 shall keep written minutes of any hearings that are conducted.
12 7. To the extent possible, the merits of the contest must be
13 presented and submitted to the committee upon depositions and
14 any written or oral arguments as the chair may order. If, at any
15 hearings or other proceedings, any oral statements are made that
16 purport to establish matters of fact, the statements must be made
17 under oath. Strict rules of evidence do not apply in any hearings
18 or other proceedings, but the chair may admit or exclude any
19 evidence based on the rules of evidence.
20 8. A party may take the deposition of any witness at any time
21 after the statement of contest is filed with the Secretary of State,
22 but the chair may establish reasonable limitations and deadlines
23 regarding any depositions. Before taking a deposition, a party
24 must provide at least 5 days’ notice to the prospective deponent
25 and the other party.
26 9. To prevail on the merits of the contest, the contestant has
27 the burden of proving that, based on one or more of the grounds
28 set forth in NRS 293.410, there were sufficient irregularities in the
29 election of such a substantial nature as to establish that the result
30 of the election was changed thereby.
31 10. If the committee reviews the merits of the contest
32 pursuant to this Rule, the committee shall report to the Assembly
33 its findings and its recommendation on which party should be
34 declared elected, unless the committee declines to make such a
35 recommendation in its report. As soon as practicable after
36 receiving the committee’s report, the Assembly shall vote on
37 whether to accept or reject the committee’s recommendation
38 without amendment, if such a recommendation is made. If the
39 Assembly accepts the committee’s recommendation, the Speaker
40 shall declare the recommended party elected. If the Assembly
41 rejects the committee’s recommendation or if the committee did
42 not make such a recommendation, the Assembly shall vote on
43 which party should be declared elected, and the Speaker shall
44 declare the party elected after the vote.

2
3 Rule No. 126. Authorized Use of Remote-Technology Systems
4 in Exceptional Circumstances.
5 1. As used in this Rule, “remote-technology system” means
6 any system or other means of communication that is:
7 (a) Approved by the Speaker and uses any electronic, digital or
8 other similar technology to enable a member of the Assembly from
9 a remote location to attend, participate, vote and take any other
10 action in any proceedings of the Assembly or the Committee of the
11 Whole even though the member is not physically present within
12 the Assembly Chambers or at a meeting of the Committee of the
13 Whole.
14 (b) Approved by the chair of a committee, other than the
15 Committee of the Whole, and uses any electronic, digital or other
16 similar technology to enable a member of the Assembly from a
17 remote location to attend, participate, vote and take any other
18 action in any proceedings of the committee even though the
19 member is not physically present at a meeting of the committee.
20 2. Upon request by a member of the Assembly:
21 (a) The Speaker may authorize the member to use a remote-
22 technology system to attend, participate, vote and take any other
23 action in any proceedings of the Assembly or the Committee of the
24 Whole if the Speaker determines that exceptional circumstances
25 warrant such use by the member. If the Speaker grants such
26 authorization, it must be entered in the Journal of the Assembly.
27 (b) The chair of a committee, other than the Committee of the
28 Whole, with the approval of the Speaker, may authorize the
29 member to use a remote-technology system to attend, participate,
30 vote and take any other action in any proceedings of the
31 committee if the chair and the Speaker determine that exceptional
32 circumstances warrant such use by the member. If the chair
33 grants such authorization, it must be entered in the records of the
34 committee.
35 3. If a member of the Assembly uses a remote-technology
36 system to attend, participate, vote and take any other action in any
37 proceedings pursuant to this Rule, the member shall be deemed to
38 be present and in attendance at the proceedings for all purposes.
39 4. For the purposes of voting in proceedings of:
40 (a) The Assembly or the Committee of the Whole, the Chief
41 Clerk of the Assembly, or an authorized assistant, shall call the
42 roll of each member who is authorized to use a remote-technology
43 system for the proceedings and, in accordance with the procedures
44 of the Assembly, cause the member’s vote to be entered into the
-
*AR1*

– 33 –
1 record for the purposes of the Journal of the Assembly or the
2 records of the Committee of the Whole, as applicable.
3 (b) A committee, other than the Committee of the Whole, the
4 committee secretary shall call the roll of each member who is
5 authorized to use a remote-technology system for the proceedings
6 and, in accordance with the procedures of the committee, cause
7 the member’s vote to be entered into the record for the purposes of
8 the records of the committee.
9 5. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 7 of Assembly
10 Standing Rule No. 55, this Rule supersedes, takes precedence and
11 controls over any other rule, provision or principle of law to the
12 extent of any conflict with this Rule.
13 6. The Assembly hereby finds and declares that:
14 (a) The Nevada Constitution invests each House of the
15 Legislature with certain plenary and exclusive constitutional
16 powers which may be exercised only by that House and which
17 cannot be usurped, infringed or impaired by the other House or by
18 any other branch of Nevada’s State Government. (Heller v.
19 Legislature, 120 Nev. 456 (2004); Commission on Ethics v. Hardy,
20 125 Nev. 285 (2009); Mason’s Manual of Legislative Procedure §§
21 2-3 & 560-564 (2010) (Mason’s Manual))
22 (b) Section 6 of Article 4 of the Nevada Constitution invests
23 each House with plenary and exclusive constitutional powers to
24 determine the rules of its proceedings and to govern, control and
25 regulate its membership and its internal organization, affairs and
26 management, expressly providing that: “Each House shall judge
27 of the qualifications, elections and returns of its own members,
28 choose its own officers (except the President of the Senate),
29 determine the rules of its proceedings and may punish its members
30 for disorderly conduct, and with the concurrence of two thirds of
31 all the members elected, expel a member.”
32 (c) In addition to its plenary and exclusive constitutional
33 powers, each House possesses certain inherent powers of
34 institutional self-protection and self-preservation to govern,
35 control and regulate its membership and its internal organization,
36 affairs and management. (In re Chapman, 166 U.S. 661, 668
37 (1897); Mason’s Manual § 2; Luther S. Cushing, Elements of the
38 Law & Practice of Legislative Assemblies § 533 (1856) (Cushing’s
39 Legislative Assemblies))
40 (d) The inherent powers of each House are considered “so
41 essential to the authority of a legislative assembly, that it cannot
42 well exist without them; and they are consequently entitled to be
43 regarded as belonging to every such assembly as a necessary
44 incident.” (Cushing’s Legislative Assemblies § 533)
-
*AR1*

– 34 –
1 (e) The inherent powers of each House authorize it to take all
2 necessary and proper institutional actions that are “recognized by
3 the common parliamentary law.” (Cushing’s Legislative
4 Assemblies § 684)
5 (f) Thus, it is well established that each House is “vested with
6 all the powers and privileges which are necessary and incidental to
7 a free and unobstructed exercise of its appropriate functions.
8 These powers and privileges are derived not from the Constitution;
9 on the contrary, they arise from the very creation of a legislative
10 body, and are founded upon the principle of self-preservation.”
11 (Ex parte McCarthy, 29 Cal. 395, 403 (1866))
12 (g) Under the Nevada Constitution, there are no constitutional
13 provisions establishing a particular method for determining
14 whether a member of either House is present at legislative
15 proceedings.
16 (h) The United States Supreme Court has held that when there
17 are no constitutional provisions establishing a particular method
18 for determining whether a member of a legislative house is present
19 at legislative proceedings, “it is therefore within the competency of
20 the house to prescribe any method which shall be reasonably
21 certain to ascertain the fact.” (United States v. Ballin, 144 U.S. 1,
22 6 (1892))
23 (i) The United States Supreme Court has also held that when a
24 legislative house adopts a rule establishing a reasonable method
25 for determining whether a member is present at legislative
26 proceedings, that rule must be given great deference by the courts
27 because:
28 Neither do the advantages or disadvantages, the wisdom or
29 folly, of such a rule present any matters for judicial
30 consideration. With the courts the question is only one of
31 power. The constitution empowers each house to determine
32 its rules of proceedings. It may not by its rules ignore
33 constitutional restraints or violate fundamental rights, and
34 there should be a reasonable relation between the mode or
35 method of proceeding established by the rule and the result
36 which is sought to be attained. But within these limitations
37 all matters of method are open to the determination of the
38 house, and it is no impeachment of the rule to say that some
39 other way would be better, more accurate, or even more just.
40 It is no objection to the validity of a rule that a different one
41 has been prescribed and in force for a length of time. The
42 power to make rules is not one which once exercised is
-
*AR1*

– 35 –
1 exhausted. It is a continuous power, always subject to be
2 exercised by the house, and, within the limitations
3 suggested, absolute and beyond the challenge of any other
4 body or tribunal.
5
6 (United States v. Ballin, 144 U.S. 1, 5 (1892))
7 7. The Assembly hereby exercises its constitutional and
8 inherent powers and privileges and adopts this Rule to:
9 (a) Govern, control and regulate its membership and its
10 internal organization, affairs and management;
11 (b) Ensure its institutional self-protection and self-
12 preservation; and
13 (c) Establish a reasonable method for determining whether a
14 member of the Assembly is present at legislative proceedings
15 during exceptional circumstances.

30

32 The Assembly Chamber shall not be used for any public or
33 private business other than legislative, except by permission of the
34 Assembly.

37
38 Rule No. 142. Request for Drafting of Bills, Resolutions or

41 Legislative Counsel shall not honor a request for the drafting of a
42 bill or resolution to be introduced in the Assembly during a special
43 session, or an amendment to a bill or resolution, unless it is
44 submitted by the Speaker, the Committee of the Whole, such other

1 committees as the Speaker may appoint for a special session or a
2 conference committee.
3 2. The standing Committee on Legislative Operations and
4 Elections may request the drafting of three Assembly resolutions
5 and one Assembly concurrent resolution necessary to establish the

7 the Legislature for a special session.
8 3. The Speaker may request the drafting of five bills for a
9 special session without seeking the approval of the Assembly.
