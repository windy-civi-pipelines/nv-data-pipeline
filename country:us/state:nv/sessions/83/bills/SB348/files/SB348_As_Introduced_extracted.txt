Legislative Counsel’s Digest:

2 such charges as may be established, to health officials, the Director of the State

4 facilities for the prompt diagnosis of communicable diseases. (NRS 439.240)
5 Existing law requires the State Board of Health to adopt regulations governing
-

– 2 –
6 examinations and tests required for the discovery in infants of preventable or
7 inheritable disorders. Existing law further requires any physician, midwife, nurse,
8 freestanding birthing center or hospital of any nature attending or assisting any
9 infant, or the person who gave birth to any infant, at childbirth to: (1) examine the
10 infant in accordance with those regulations; and (2) collect and send to the State
11 Public Health Laboratory any specimens needed for the examinations and tests that
12 must be performed by a laboratory. (NRS 442.008) Section 3 of this bill requires
13 the State Public Health Laboratory to charge a fee of $150 for the required
14 examinations and tests for the discovery in infants of preventable or inheritable
15 disorders. Section 3 provides for an annual increase in that fee by a percentage
16 equal to the percentage of increase in the Consumer Price Index, Medical Care
17 Component during the immediately preceding year. Section 1 of this bill makes a
18 conforming change to clarify that the State Public Health Laboratory is not
19 authorized to establish a fee for the services for which a fee is fixed by section 3.
20 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of physicians, physician
21 assistants, anesthesiologist assistants, perfusionists and practitioners of respiratory
22 care by the Board of Medical Examiners. (Chapter 630 of NRS) Sections 20-57 of
23 this bill additionally provide for the licensure and regulation of genetic counselors
24 by the Board. Sections 21 and 22 define the terms “genetic counseling” and
25 “genetic counselor,” respectively, and section 31 establishes the applicability of
26 those definitions. Section 57 makes it a felony for a person to practice genetic
27 counseling or hold himself or herself out as a genetic counselor without a license.
28 Section 24 prescribes the requirements to obtain such a license, including obtaining
29 certain education, passing certain examinations and obtaining certification from the
30 American Board of Genetic Counseling. Section 25 authorizes the Board to issue a
31 temporary license under which a person who has obtained the required education
32 but has not yet passed the required examination or obtained the required
33 certification may engage in the supervised practice of genetic counseling. Section
34 23 requires the Board to adopt regulations regarding the licensure and practice of
35 genetic counselors. Section 26 authorizes certain unlicensed persons to provide
36 assistance or consulting services related to genetic counseling, and section 33
37 exempts a genetic counselor of the Federal Government from licensure and
38 regulation by the Board. Section 26 also authorizes a physician or a physician
39 assistant to engage in genetic counseling as part of his or her practice without
40 obtaining a license as a genetic counselor. Section 27 prescribes the date on which
41 a license as a genetic counselor expires and the requirements to renew such a
42 license. Section 40 prescribes the maximum fees that the Board may charge for the
43 issuance or renewal of a license or a temporary license as a genetic counselor.
44 Section 28 prescribes the procedure for the voluntary surrender of such a license.
45 Section 29 prescribes the grounds for disciplinary action against a genetic
46 counselor. Sections 41, 42 and 44 apply to genetic counselors the existing process
47 for the filing of a complaint with the Board concerning a licensee or notifying the
48 Board of certain actions taken against a licensee. Sections 43, 45-50, 53 and 55
49 apply to genetic counselors: (1) existing procedures for the investigation of
50 complaints and the imposition of disciplinary action against licensees; and (2)
51 certain other existing procedures to address incompetence or misconduct by a
52 licensee. Section 51 applies to genetic counselors the existing procedure to remove
53 limitations that the Board has placed on a license or to restore a revoked license.
54 Sections 53, 54, 56 and 57 authorize or require the Board to take certain actions
55 against a person who is practicing genetic counseling or holding himself or herself
56 out as a genetic counselor without a license.
57 Sections 30, 32 and 36-38 make various conforming changes so that genetic
58 counselors are treated similarly to other providers of health care licensed by the
59 Board for certain purposes related to licensure and regulation. Section 34 deems
60 any act that constitutes the practice of genetic counseling to occur where the patient
-
*SB348*
– 3 –
61 is located at the time the act is performed. Section 35 authorizes the Board to select
62 genetic counselors to serve as advisory members of the Board. Sections 39 and 52
63 subject genetic counselors to certain provisions required by federal law for the
64 enforcement of child support obligations. (42 U.S.C. § 666)
65 Existing law defines the term “provider of health care” to mean a person who
66 practices any of certain professions related to the provision of health care. (NRS
67 629.031) Existing law imposes certain requirements upon providers of health care,
68 including requirements for billing, standards for advertisements and criminal
69 penalties for acquiring certain debts. (NRS 629.071, 629.076, 629.078) Section 18
70 of this bill includes genetic counselors in the definition of “provider of health care,”
71 thereby subjecting genetic counselors to those same requirements. Section 59 of
72 this bill requires a genetic counselor to report misconduct by a person licensed or
73 certified by the State Board of Nursing to the Executive Director of that Board.
74 Existing law establishes a privilege for confidential communications between a
75 patient and a physician, dentist, chiropractor or a person participating in the
76 diagnosis or treatment of the patient under the direction of such a provider. (NRS
77 49.215-49.245) Section 7 of this bill extends that same privilege to apply to
78 confidential communications between a patient and a genetic counselor or a person
79 under the direction of a genetic counselor.
80 Existing law provides that: (1) assault is generally a misdemeanor, with certain
81 exceptions; and (2) assault upon a provider of health care is a gross misdemeanor or
82 felony, depending on the circumstances. (NRS 200.471) Section 10 of this bill
83 includes a genetic counselor within the definition of “provider of health care” for
84 that purpose, thereby making assault upon a genetic counselor a gross misdemeanor
85 or felony, depending on the circumstances. Section 11 of this bill requires a genetic
86 counselor to report the abuse, neglect, exploitation, isolation or abandonment of an
87 older person or vulnerable person in the same manner as other providers of health
88 care. A genetic counselor would also be required to report the abuse, neglect or
89 commercial sexual exploitation of a child. (NRS 432B.220, 432C.110) Sections 58,
90 60 and 61 of this bill provide that a genetic counselor acting within his or her scope
91 of practice is not violating provisions governing certain other providers of health
92 care. Sections 2, 4-6, 8, 9, 12, 13, 15, 17, 19, 62 and 63 of this bill make revisions
93 to treat genetic counselors in the same manner as other similar providers of health
94 care in certain other respects.
95 Section 16 of this bill requires Medicaid to cover genetic counseling services
96 provided by a licensed genetic counselor. Section 14 of this bill makes a
97 conforming change to require the Director of the Department of Health and Human
98 Services to administer the provisions of section 16 in the same manner as other
99 provisions governing Medicaid.
100 Section 64 of this bill makes an appropriation from the State General Fund to
101 the State Public Health Laboratory for the purpose of the construction of expanded
102 laboratory space and the purchase of equipment, personnel and card storage.
103 Section 65 of this bill makes an appropriation from the State General Fund to
104 the Alliance for Childhood Diseases, doing business as Cure 4 The Kids
105 Foundation, for the establishment and operation of a metabolic clinic.
106 Section 66 of this bill requires the Division of Health Care Financing and
107 Policy of the Department of Health and Human Services, during the 2025-2026
108 legislative interim, to: (1) conduct a comprehensive review of the services covered
109 by Medicaid for infants and children and the degree to which such coverage meets
110 the needs of infants and children; and (2) submit a report of the review and any
111 resulting recommendations to the Legislature.

35 upon petition of any party in interest, modify the judgment to award
36 and apportion the unpaid future damages in accordance with this
37 subsection.
38 6. If the court finds that the judgment debtor has exhibited a
39 continuing pattern of failing to make the periodic payments as
40 specified pursuant to subsection 5, the court shall find the judgment
41 debtor in contempt of court and, in addition to the required periodic
42 payments, shall order the judgment debtor to pay the judgment
43 creditor all damages caused by the failure to make such periodic
44 payments, including, but not limited to, court costs and attorney’s
45 fees.

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the State Public Health Laboratory to make available, at
2 such charges as may be established, to health officials, the Director of the State
3 Department of Agriculture and licensed physicians of the State, proper laboratory
4 facilities for the prompt diagnosis of communicable diseases. (NRS 439.240)
5 Existing law requires the State Board of Health to adopt regulations governing
-
*SB348*

– 2 –
6 examinations and tests required for the discovery in infants of preventable or
7 inheritable disorders. Existing law further requires any physician, midwife, nurse,
8 freestanding birthing center or hospital of any nature attending or assisting any
9 infant, or the person who gave birth to any infant, at childbirth to: (1) examine the
10 infant in accordance with those regulations; and (2) collect and send to the State
11 Public Health Laboratory any specimens needed for the examinations and tests that
12 must be performed by a laboratory. (NRS 442.008) Section 3 of this bill requires
13 the State Public Health Laboratory to charge a fee of $150 for the required
14 examinations and tests for the discovery in infants of preventable or inheritable
15 disorders. Section 3 provides for an annual increase in that fee by a percentage
16 equal to the percentage of increase in the Consumer Price Index, Medical Care
17 Component during the immediately preceding year. Section 1 of this bill makes a
18 conforming change to clarify that the State Public Health Laboratory is not
19 authorized to establish a fee for the services for which a fee is fixed by section 3.
20 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of physicians, physician
21 assistants, anesthesiologist assistants, perfusionists and practitioners of respiratory
22 care by the Board of Medical Examiners. (Chapter 630 of NRS) Sections 20-57 of
23 this bill additionally provide for the licensure and regulation of genetic counselors
24 by the Board. Sections 21 and 22 define the terms “genetic counseling” and
25 “genetic counselor,” respectively, and section 31 establishes the applicability of
26 those definitions. Section 57 makes it a felony for a person to practice genetic
27 counseling or hold himself or herself out as a genetic counselor without a license.
28 Section 24 prescribes the requirements to obtain such a license, including obtaining
29 certain education, passing certain examinations and obtaining certification from the
30 American Board of Genetic Counseling. Section 25 authorizes the Board to issue a
31 temporary license under which a person who has obtained the required education
32 but has not yet passed the required examination or obtained the required
33 certification may engage in the supervised practice of genetic counseling. Section
34 23 requires the Board to adopt regulations regarding the licensure and practice of
35 genetic counselors. Section 26 authorizes certain unlicensed persons to provide
36 assistance or consulting services related to genetic counseling, and section 33
37 exempts a genetic counselor of the Federal Government from licensure and
38 regulation by the Board. Section 26 also authorizes a physician or a physician
39 assistant to engage in genetic counseling as part of his or her practice without
40 obtaining a license as a genetic counselor. Section 27 prescribes the date on which
41 a license as a genetic counselor expires and the requirements to renew such a
42 license. Section 40 prescribes the maximum fees that the Board may charge for the
43 issuance or renewal of a license or a temporary license as a genetic counselor.
44 Section 28 prescribes the procedure for the voluntary surrender of such a license.
45 Section 29 prescribes the grounds for disciplinary action against a genetic
46 counselor. Sections 41, 42 and 44 apply to genetic counselors the existing process
47 for the filing of a complaint with the Board concerning a licensee or notifying the
48 Board of certain actions taken against a licensee. Sections 43, 45-50, 53 and 55
49 apply to genetic counselors: (1) existing procedures for the investigation of
50 complaints and the imposition of disciplinary action against licensees; and (2)
51 certain other existing procedures to address incompetence or misconduct by a
52 licensee. Section 51 applies to genetic counselors the existing procedure to remove
53 limitations that the Board has placed on a license or to restore a revoked license.
54 Sections 53, 54, 56 and 57 authorize or require the Board to take certain actions
55 against a person who is practicing genetic counseling or holding himself or herself
56 out as a genetic counselor without a license.
57 Sections 30, 32 and 36-38 make various conforming changes so that genetic
58 counselors are treated similarly to other providers of health care licensed by the
59 Board for certain purposes related to licensure and regulation. Section 34 deems
60 any act that constitutes the practice of genetic counseling to occur where the patient
-
*SB348*

– 3 –
61 is located at the time the act is performed. Section 35 authorizes the Board to select
62 genetic counselors to serve as advisory members of the Board. Sections 39 and 52
63 subject genetic counselors to certain provisions required by federal law for the
64 enforcement of child support obligations. (42 U.S.C. § 666)
65 Existing law defines the term “provider of health care” to mean a person who
66 practices any of certain professions related to the provision of health care. (NRS
67 629.031) Existing law imposes certain requirements upon providers of health care,
68 including requirements for billing, standards for advertisements and criminal
69 penalties for acquiring certain debts. (NRS 629.071, 629.076, 629.078) Section 18
70 of this bill includes genetic counselors in the definition of “provider of health care,”
71 thereby subjecting genetic counselors to those same requirements. Section 59 of
72 this bill requires a genetic counselor to report misconduct by a person licensed or
73 certified by the State Board of Nursing to the Executive Director of that Board.
74 Existing law establishes a privilege for confidential communications between a
75 patient and a physician, dentist, chiropractor or a person participating in the
76 diagnosis or treatment of the patient under the direction of such a provider. (NRS
77 49.215-49.245) Section 7 of this bill extends that same privilege to apply to
78 confidential communications between a patient and a genetic counselor or a person
79 under the direction of a genetic counselor.
80 Existing law provides that: (1) assault is generally a misdemeanor, with certain
81 exceptions; and (2) assault upon a provider of health care is a gross misdemeanor or
82 felony, depending on the circumstances. (NRS 200.471) Section 10 of this bill
83 includes a genetic counselor within the definition of “provider of health care” for
84 that purpose, thereby making assault upon a genetic counselor a gross misdemeanor
85 or felony, depending on the circumstances. Section 11 of this bill requires a genetic
86 counselor to report the abuse, neglect, exploitation, isolation or abandonment of an
87 older person or vulnerable person in the same manner as other providers of health
88 care. A genetic counselor would also be required to report the abuse, neglect or
89 commercial sexual exploitation of a child. (NRS 432B.220, 432C.110) Sections 58,
90 60 and 61 of this bill provide that a genetic counselor acting within his or her scope
91 of practice is not violating provisions governing certain other providers of health
92 care. Sections 2, 4-6, 8, 9, 12, 13, 15, 17, 19, 62 and 63 of this bill make revisions
93 to treat genetic counselors in the same manner as other similar providers of health
94 care in certain other respects.
95 Section 16 of this bill requires Medicaid to cover genetic counseling services
96 provided by a licensed genetic counselor. Section 14 of this bill makes a
97 conforming change to require the Director of the Department of Health and Human
98 Services to administer the provisions of section 16 in the same manner as other
99 provisions governing Medicaid.
100 Section 64 of this bill makes an appropriation from the State General Fund to
101 the State Public Health Laboratory for the purpose of the construction of expanded
102 laboratory space and the purchase of equipment, personnel and card storage.
103 Section 65 of this bill makes an appropriation from the State General Fund to
104 the Alliance for Childhood Diseases, doing business as Cure 4 The Kids
105 Foundation, for the establishment and operation of a metabolic clinic.
106 Section 66 of this bill requires the Division of Health Care Financing and
107 Policy of the Department of Health and Human Services, during the 2025-2026
108 legislative interim, to: (1) conduct a comprehensive review of the services covered
109 by Medicaid for infants and children and the degree to which such coverage meets
110 the needs of infants and children; and (2) submit a report of the review and any
111 resulting recommendations to the Legislature.
