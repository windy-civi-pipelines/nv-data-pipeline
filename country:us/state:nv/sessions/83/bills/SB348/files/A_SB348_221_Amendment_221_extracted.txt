Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the State Public Health Laboratory to make available, at such
2 charges as may be established, to health officials, the Director of the State Department of
3 Agriculture and licensed physicians of the State, proper laboratory facilities for the prompt
4 diagnosis of communicable diseases. (NRS 439.240) Existing law requires the State Board of
5 Health to adopt regulations governing examinations and tests required for the discovery in
6 infants of preventable or inheritable disorders. Existing law further requires any physician,
7 midwife, nurse, freestanding birthing center or hospital of any nature attending or assisting
8 any infant, or the person who gave birth to any infant, at childbirth to: (1) examine the infant
9 in accordance with those regulations; and (2) collect and send to the State Public Health
10 Laboratory any specimens needed for the examinations and tests that must be performed by a
11 laboratory. (NRS 442.008) Section 3 of this bill requires the State Public Health Laboratory to
12 charge a fee of $150 for the required examinations and tests for the discovery in infants of
13 preventable or inheritable disorders. [Section 3 provides for an annual increase in that fee by a
Senate Amendment No. 221 to Senate Bill No. 348 Page 4
14 percentage equal to the percentage of increase in the Consumer Price Index, Medical Care
15 Component during the immediately preceding year.] Section 1 of this bill makes a conforming
16 change to clarify that the State Public Health Laboratory is not authorized to establish a fee for
17 the services for which a fee is fixed by section 3.
18 [Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of physicians, physician assistants,
19 anesthesiologist assistants, perfusionists and practitioners of respiratory care by the Board of
20 Medical Examiners. (Chapter 630 of NRS) Sections 20-57 of this bill additionally provide for
21 the licensure and regulation of genetic counselors by the Board. Sections 21 and 22 define the
22 terms “genetic counseling” and “genetic counselor,” respectively, and section 31 establishes
23 the applicability of those definitions. Section 57 makes it a felony for a person to practice
24 genetic counseling or hold himself or herself out as a genetic counselor without a license.
25 Section 24 prescribes the requirements to obtain such a license, including obtaining certain
26 education, passing certain examinations and obtaining certification from the American Board
27 of Genetic Counseling. Section 25 authorizes the Board to issue a temporary license under
28 which a person who has obtained the required education but has not yet passed the required
29 examination or obtained the required certification may engage in the supervised practice of
30 genetic counseling. Section 23 requires the Board to adopt regulations regarding the licensure
31 and practice of genetic counselors. Section 26 authorizes certain unlicensed persons to provide
32 assistance or consulting services related to genetic counseling, and section 33 exempts a
33 genetic counselor of the Federal Government from licensure and regulation by the Board.
34 Section 26 also authorizes a physician or a physician assistant to engage in genetic counseling
35 as part of his or her practice without obtaining a license as a genetic counselor. Section 27
36 prescribes the date on which a license as a genetic counselor expires and the requirements to
37 renew such a license. Section 40 prescribes the maximum fees that the Board may charge for
38 the issuance or renewal of a license or a temporary license as a genetic counselor. Section 28
39 prescribes the procedure for the voluntary surrender of such a license.
40 Section 29 prescribes the grounds for disciplinary action against a genetic counselor.
41 Sections 41, 42 and 44 apply to genetic counselors the existing process for the filing of a
42 complaint with the Board concerning a licensee or notifying the Board of certain actions taken
43 against a licensee. Sections 43, 45-50, 53 and 55 apply to genetic counselors: (1) existing
44 procedures for the investigation of complaints and the imposition of disciplinary action
45 against licensees; and (2) certain other existing procedures to address incompetence or
46 misconduct by a licensee. Section 51 applies to genetic counselors the existing procedure to
47 remove limitations that the Board has placed on a license or to restore a revoked license.
48 Sections 53, 54, 56 and 57 authorize or require the Board to take certain actions against a
49 person who is practicing genetic counseling or holding himself or herself out as a genetic
50 counselor without a license.
51 Sections 30, 32 and 36-38 make various conforming changes so that genetic counselors
52 are treated similarly to other providers of health care licensed by the Board for certain
53 purposes related to licensure and regulation. Section 34 deems any act that constitutes the
54 practice of genetic counseling to occur where the patient is located at the time the act is
55 performed. Section 35 authorizes the Board to select genetic counselors to serve as advisory
56 members of the Board. Sections 39 and 52 subject genetic counselors to certain provisions
57 required by federal law for the enforcement of child support obligations. (42 U.S.C. § 666)
58 Existing law defines the term “provider of health care” to mean a person who practices
59 any of certain professions related to the provision of health care. (NRS 629.031) Existing law
60 imposes certain requirements upon providers of health care, including requirements for
61 billing, standards for advertisements and criminal penalties for acquiring certain debts. (NRS
62 629.071, 629.076, 629.078) Section 18 of this bill includes genetic counselors in the definition
63 of “provider of health care,” thereby subjecting genetic counselors to those same
64 requirements. Section 59 of this bill requires a genetic counselor to report misconduct by a
65 person licensed or certified by the State Board of Nursing to the Executive Director of that
66 Board.
67 Existing law establishes a privilege for confidential communications between a patient
68 and a physician, dentist, chiropractor or a person participating in the diagnosis or treatment of
69 the patient under the direction of such a provider. (NRS 49.215-49.245) Section 7 of this bill
70 extends that same privilege to apply to confidential communications between a patient and a
71 genetic counselor or a person under the direction of a genetic counselor.
Senate Amendment No. 221 to Senate Bill No. 348 Page 5
72 Existing law provides that: (1) assault is generally a misdemeanor, with certain
73 exceptions; and (2) assault upon a provider of health care is a gross misdemeanor or felony,
74 depending on the circumstances. (NRS 200.471) Section 10 of this bill includes a genetic
75 counselor within the definition of “provider of health care” for that purpose, thereby making
76 assault upon a genetic counselor a gross misdemeanor or felony, depending on the
77 circumstances. Section 11 of this bill requires a genetic counselor to report the abuse, neglect,
78 exploitation, isolation or abandonment of an older person or vulnerable person in the same
79 manner as other providers of health care. A genetic counselor would also be required to report
80 the abuse, neglect or commercial sexual exploitation of a child. (NRS 432B.220, 432C.110)
81 Sections 58, 60 and 61 of this bill provide that a genetic counselor acting within his or her
82 scope of practice is not violating provisions governing certain other providers of health care.
83 Sections 2, 4-6, 8, 9, 12, 13, 15, 17, 19, 62 and 63 of this bill make revisions to treat genetic
84 counselors in the same manner as other similar providers of health care in certain other
85 respects.
86 Section 16 of this bill requires Medicaid to cover genetic counseling services provided by
87 a licensed genetic counselor. Section 14 of this bill makes a conforming change to require the
88 Director of the Department of Health and Human Services to administer the provisions of
89 section 16 in the same manner as other provisions governing Medicaid.
90 Section 64 of this bill makes an appropriation from the State General Fund to the State
91 Public Health Laboratory for the purpose of the construction of expanded laboratory space
92 and the purchase of equipment, personnel and card storage.
93 Section 65 of this bill makes an appropriation from the State General Fund to the Alliance
94 for Childhood Diseases, doing business as Cure 4 The Kids Foundation, for the establishment
95 and operation of a metabolic clinic.
96 Section 66 of this bill requires the Division of Health Care Financing and Policy of the
97 Department of Health and Human Services, during the 2025-2026 legislative interim, to: (1)
98 conduct a comprehensive review of the services covered by Medicaid for infants and children
99 and the degree to which such coverage meets the needs of infants and children; and (2) submit
100 a report of the review and any resulting recommendations to the Legislature.]

16 federal income disability or worker’s compensation act, any health, sickness or

27 3. In an action for injury or death against a provider of health care based upon
28 professional negligence, a district court shall, at the request of either party, enter a

30 judgment creditor be paid in whole or in part by periodic payments rather than by a
31 lump-sum payment if the award equals or exceeds $50,000 in future damages.
32 4. In entering a judgment ordering the payment of future damages by periodic
33 payments pursuant to subsection 3, the court shall make a specific finding as to the
34 dollar amount of periodic payments that will compensate the judgment creditor for
35 such future damages. As a condition to authorizing periodic payments of future
36 damages, the court shall require a judgment debtor who is not adequately insured to
37 post security adequate to assure full payment of such damages awarded by the
38 judgment. Upon termination of periodic payments of future damages, the court
39 shall order the return of this security, or so much as remains, to the judgment
40 debtor.
41 5. A judgment ordering the payment of future damages by periodic payments
42 entered pursuant to subsection 3 must specify the recipient or recipients of the
43 payments, the dollar amount of the payments, the interval between payments, and

45 Such payments must only be subject to modification in the event of the death of the
46 judgment creditor. Money damages awarded for loss of future earnings must not be
47 reduced or payments terminated by reason of the death of the judgment creditor, but
48 must be paid to persons to whom the judgment creditor owed a duty of support, as
49 provided by law, immediately before the judgment creditor’s death. In such cases,
50 the court that rendered the original judgment may, upon petition of any party in
51 interest, modify the judgment to award and apportion the unpaid future damages in
52 accordance with this subsection.

1 6. If the court finds that the judgment debtor has exhibited a continuing
2 pattern of failing to make the periodic payments as specified pursuant to subsection
3 5, the court shall find the judgment debtor in contempt of court and, in addition to
4 the required periodic payments, shall order the judgment debtor to pay the
5 judgment creditor all damages caused by the failure to make such periodic
6 payments, including, but not limited to, court costs and attorney’s fees.
7 7. Following the occurrence or expiration of all obligations specified in the
8 periodic payment judgment, any obligation of the judgment debtor to make further

13 custody, loss of future earnings, loss of bodily function, or future pain and suffering
14 of the judgment creditor.
15 (b) “Periodic payments” means the payment of money or delivery of other
16 property to the judgment creditor at regular intervals.

AN ACT relating to health care; establishing a fee to be charged by the State Public
Health Laboratory for certain examinations and tests; [prescribing
certain duties and authority of a genetic counselor; requiring Medicaid
to cover certain genetic counseling; providing for the regulation of the
practice of genetic counseling by the Board of Medical Examiners;
prescribing requirements for the issuance and renewal of a license as a
genetic counselor; authorizing the Board to take certain actions to

properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the State Public Health Laboratory to make available, at such
2 charges as may be established, to health officials, the Director of the State Department of
3 Agriculture and licensed physicians of the State, proper laboratory facilities for the prompt
4 diagnosis of communicable diseases. (NRS 439.240) Existing law requires the State Board of
5 Health to adopt regulations governing examinations and tests required for the discovery in
6 infants of preventable or inheritable disorders. Existing law further requires any physician,
7 midwife, nurse, freestanding birthing center or hospital of any nature attending or assisting
8 any infant, or the person who gave birth to any infant, at childbirth to: (1) examine the infant
9 in accordance with those regulations; and (2) collect and send to the State Public Health
10 Laboratory any specimens needed for the examinations and tests that must be performed by a
11 laboratory. (NRS 442.008) Section 3 of this bill requires the State Public Health Laboratory to
12 charge a fee of $150 for the required examinations and tests for the discovery in infants of
13 preventable or inheritable disorders. [Section 3 provides for an annual increase in that fee by a

Senate Amendment No. 221 to Senate Bill No. 348 Page 4
14 percentage equal to the percentage of increase in the Consumer Price Index, Medical Care
15 Component during the immediately preceding year.] Section 1 of this bill makes a conforming
16 change to clarify that the State Public Health Laboratory is not authorized to establish a fee for
17 the services for which a fee is fixed by section 3.
18 [Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of physicians, physician assistants,
19 anesthesiologist assistants, perfusionists and practitioners of respiratory care by the Board of
20 Medical Examiners. (Chapter 630 of NRS) Sections 20-57 of this bill additionally provide for
21 the licensure and regulation of genetic counselors by the Board. Sections 21 and 22 define the
22 terms “genetic counseling” and “genetic counselor,” respectively, and section 31 establishes
23 the applicability of those definitions. Section 57 makes it a felony for a person to practice
24 genetic counseling or hold himself or herself out as a genetic counselor without a license.
25 Section 24 prescribes the requirements to obtain such a license, including obtaining certain
26 education, passing certain examinations and obtaining certification from the American Board
27 of Genetic Counseling. Section 25 authorizes the Board to issue a temporary license under
28 which a person who has obtained the required education but has not yet passed the required
29 examination or obtained the required certification may engage in the supervised practice of
30 genetic counseling. Section 23 requires the Board to adopt regulations regarding the licensure
31 and practice of genetic counselors. Section 26 authorizes certain unlicensed persons to provide
32 assistance or consulting services related to genetic counseling, and section 33 exempts a
33 genetic counselor of the Federal Government from licensure and regulation by the Board.
34 Section 26 also authorizes a physician or a physician assistant to engage in genetic counseling
35 as part of his or her practice without obtaining a license as a genetic counselor. Section 27
36 prescribes the date on which a license as a genetic counselor expires and the requirements to
37 renew such a license. Section 40 prescribes the maximum fees that the Board may charge for
38 the issuance or renewal of a license or a temporary license as a genetic counselor. Section 28
39 prescribes the procedure for the voluntary surrender of such a license.
40 Section 29 prescribes the grounds for disciplinary action against a genetic counselor.
41 Sections 41, 42 and 44 apply to genetic counselors the existing process for the filing of a
42 complaint with the Board concerning a licensee or notifying the Board of certain actions taken
43 against a licensee. Sections 43, 45-50, 53 and 55 apply to genetic counselors: (1) existing
44 procedures for the investigation of complaints and the imposition of disciplinary action
45 against licensees; and (2) certain other existing procedures to address incompetence or
46 misconduct by a licensee. Section 51 applies to genetic counselors the existing procedure to
47 remove limitations that the Board has placed on a license or to restore a revoked license.
48 Sections 53, 54, 56 and 57 authorize or require the Board to take certain actions against a
49 person who is practicing genetic counseling or holding himself or herself out as a genetic
50 counselor without a license.
51 Sections 30, 32 and 36-38 make various conforming changes so that genetic counselors
52 are treated similarly to other providers of health care licensed by the Board for certain
53 purposes related to licensure and regulation. Section 34 deems any act that constitutes the
54 practice of genetic counseling to occur where the patient is located at the time the act is
55 performed. Section 35 authorizes the Board to select genetic counselors to serve as advisory
56 members of the Board. Sections 39 and 52 subject genetic counselors to certain provisions
57 required by federal law for the enforcement of child support obligations. (42 U.S.C. § 666)
58 Existing law defines the term “provider of health care” to mean a person who practices
59 any of certain professions related to the provision of health care. (NRS 629.031) Existing law
60 imposes certain requirements upon providers of health care, including requirements for
61 billing, standards for advertisements and criminal penalties for acquiring certain debts. (NRS
62 629.071, 629.076, 629.078) Section 18 of this bill includes genetic counselors in the definition
63 of “provider of health care,” thereby subjecting genetic counselors to those same
64 requirements. Section 59 of this bill requires a genetic counselor to report misconduct by a
65 person licensed or certified by the State Board of Nursing to the Executive Director of that
66 Board.
67 Existing law establishes a privilege for confidential communications between a patient
68 and a physician, dentist, chiropractor or a person participating in the diagnosis or treatment of
69 the patient under the direction of such a provider. (NRS 49.215-49.245) Section 7 of this bill
70 extends that same privilege to apply to confidential communications between a patient and a
71 genetic counselor or a person under the direction of a genetic counselor.

Senate Amendment No. 221 to Senate Bill No. 348 Page 5
72 Existing law provides that: (1) assault is generally a misdemeanor, with certain
73 exceptions; and (2) assault upon a provider of health care is a gross misdemeanor or felony,
74 depending on the circumstances. (NRS 200.471) Section 10 of this bill includes a genetic
75 counselor within the definition of “provider of health care” for that purpose, thereby making
76 assault upon a genetic counselor a gross misdemeanor or felony, depending on the
77 circumstances. Section 11 of this bill requires a genetic counselor to report the abuse, neglect,
78 exploitation, isolation or abandonment of an older person or vulnerable person in the same
79 manner as other providers of health care. A genetic counselor would also be required to report
80 the abuse, neglect or commercial sexual exploitation of a child. (NRS 432B.220, 432C.110)
81 Sections 58, 60 and 61 of this bill provide that a genetic counselor acting within his or her
82 scope of practice is not violating provisions governing certain other providers of health care.
83 Sections 2, 4-6, 8, 9, 12, 13, 15, 17, 19, 62 and 63 of this bill make revisions to treat genetic
84 counselors in the same manner as other similar providers of health care in certain other
85 respects.
86 Section 16 of this bill requires Medicaid to cover genetic counseling services provided by
87 a licensed genetic counselor. Section 14 of this bill makes a conforming change to require the
88 Director of the Department of Health and Human Services to administer the provisions of
89 section 16 in the same manner as other provisions governing Medicaid.
90 Section 64 of this bill makes an appropriation from the State General Fund to the State
91 Public Health Laboratory for the purpose of the construction of expanded laboratory space
92 and the purchase of equipment, personnel and card storage.
93 Section 65 of this bill makes an appropriation from the State General Fund to the Alliance
94 for Childhood Diseases, doing business as Cure 4 The Kids Foundation, for the establishment
95 and operation of a metabolic clinic.
96 Section 66 of this bill requires the Division of Health Care Financing and Policy of the
97 Department of Health and Human Services, during the 2025-2026 legislative interim, to: (1)
98 conduct a comprehensive review of the services covered by Medicaid for infants and children
99 and the degree to which such coverage meets the needs of infants and children; and (2) submit
100 a report of the review and any resulting recommendations to the Legislature.]

12 42.021 1. In an action for injury or death against a provider of health care
13 based upon professional negligence, if the defendant so elects, the defendant may
14 introduce evidence of any amount payable as a benefit to the plaintiff as a result of
15 the injury or death pursuant to the United States Social Security Act, any state or
16 federal income disability or worker’s compensation act, any health, sickness or
17 income-disability insurance, accident insurance that provides health benefits or
18 income-disability coverage, and any contract or agreement of any group,

23 benefits concerning which the defendant has introduced evidence.
24 2. A source of collateral benefits introduced pursuant to subsection 1 may not:
25 (a) Recover any amount against the plaintiff; or
26 (b) Be subrogated to the rights of the plaintiff against a defendant.
27 3. In an action for injury or death against a provider of health care based upon
28 professional negligence, a district court shall, at the request of either party, enter a

30 judgment creditor be paid in whole or in part by periodic payments rather than by a
31 lump-sum payment if the award equals or exceeds $50,000 in future damages.
32 4. In entering a judgment ordering the payment of future damages by periodic
33 payments pursuant to subsection 3, the court shall make a specific finding as to the
34 dollar amount of periodic payments that will compensate the judgment creditor for
35 such future damages. As a condition to authorizing periodic payments of future
36 damages, the court shall require a judgment debtor who is not adequately insured to
37 post security adequate to assure full payment of such damages awarded by the
38 judgment. Upon termination of periodic payments of future damages, the court
39 shall order the return of this security, or so much as remains, to the judgment
40 debtor.
41 5. A judgment ordering the payment of future damages by periodic payments
42 entered pursuant to subsection 3 must specify the recipient or recipients of the
43 payments, the dollar amount of the payments, the interval between payments, and
44 the number of payments or the period of time over which payments will be made.
45 Such payments must only be subject to modification in the event of the death of the
46 judgment creditor. Money damages awarded for loss of future earnings must not be
47 reduced or payments terminated by reason of the death of the judgment creditor, but
48 must be paid to persons to whom the judgment creditor owed a duty of support, as
49 provided by law, immediately before the judgment creditor’s death. In such cases,
50 the court that rendered the original judgment may, upon petition of any party in
51 interest, modify the judgment to award and apportion the unpaid future damages in
52 accordance with this subsection.

1 6. If the court finds that the judgment debtor has exhibited a continuing
2 pattern of failing to make the periodic payments as specified pursuant to subsection
3 5, the court shall find the judgment debtor in contempt of court and, in addition to
4 the required periodic payments, shall order the judgment debtor to pay the
5 judgment creditor all damages caused by the failure to make such periodic
6 payments, including, but not limited to, court costs and attorney’s fees.
