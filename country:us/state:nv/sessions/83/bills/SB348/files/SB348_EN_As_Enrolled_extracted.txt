Section 1:
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to health care; establishing a fee the State Public
Health Laboratory is authorized to charge for certain
examinations and tests for the discovery of certain diseases in
infants; removing a requirement that the State Public Health
Laboratory hold a public hearing under certain
circumstances; requiring Medicaid to reimburse such
examinations and tests separately from reimbursement for
other labor and delivery services and newborn care; requiring
the Director of the Department of Health and Human
Services to request the establishment of a certain rate of
reimbursement for such examinations and tests; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law requires the State Public Health Laboratory to make available, at
such charges as may be established, to health officials, the Director of the State
Department of Agriculture and licensed physicians of the State, proper laboratory
facilities for the prompt diagnosis of communicable diseases. (NRS 439.240)
Existing law requires the State Board of Health to adopt regulations governing
examinations and tests required for the discovery in infants of preventable or
inheritable disorders. Existing law further requires any physician, midwife, nurse,
freestanding birthing center or hospital of any nature attending or assisting any
infant, or the person who gave birth to any infant, at childbirth to: (1) examine the
infant in accordance with those regulations; and (2) collect and send to the State
Public Health Laboratory any specimens needed for the examinations and tests that
must be performed by a laboratory. (NRS 442.008) Section 3 of this bill authorizes
the State Public Health Laboratory, on or after January 1, 2026, to charge a fee of
not more than $150 or the rate of reimbursement paid by Medicaid, whichever is
less, for the required examinations and tests for the discovery in infants of
preventable or inheritable disorders. Section 1 of this bill makes a conforming
change to clarify that the State Public Health Laboratory establishes the fee for such
examinations and tests pursuant to section 3. Section 3 also removes a requirement
that the State Public Health Laboratory hold a public hearing before increasing that
fee. Section 68.7 of this bill authorizes the State Public Health Laboratory, on or
after July 1, 2025, and before January 1, 2026, to charge a fee of not more than
$122 for the required examinations and tests for the discovery in infants of
preventable or inheritable disorders.
Existing law requires the Department of Health and Human Services to
administer the Medicaid program. (NRS 422.270) Section 3.7 of this bill requires
the Director of the Department to provide reimbursement under Medicaid for the
required examinations and tests for the discovery in infants of preventable or
inheritable disorders separately from the reimbursement provided for other labor
and delivery services and newborn care. Section 3.4 of this bill makes a
conforming change to indicate that the provisions of section 3.7 will be
administered in the same manner as the provisions of existing law governing
Medicaid. Section 68.3 of this bill requires the Director to submit to the United
States Secretary of Health and Human Services, to the extent that money is
available and as soon as practicable, a request to include under Medicaid a rate of
-

reimbursement of not more than $122 for such examinations and tests. Sections 3.7
and 68.3 authorize the Director to increase that rate of reimbursement to not more
than $150 on or after January 1, 2026.
