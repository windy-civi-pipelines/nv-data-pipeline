AN ACT relating to health care; establishing a fee the State Public
Health Laboratory is authorized to charge for certain
examinations and tests for the discovery of certain
diseases in infants; requiring Medicaid to reimburse such
examinations and tests separately from reimbursement for
other labor and delivery services and newborn care;
requiring the Director of the Department of Health and
Human Services to request the establishment of a certain
rate of reimbursement for such examinations and tests;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the State Public Health Laboratory to make available, at
2 such charges as may be established, to health officials, the Director of the State
3 Department of Agriculture and licensed physicians of the State, proper laboratory
4 facilities for the prompt diagnosis of communicable diseases. (NRS 439.240)
5 Existing law requires the State Board of Health to adopt regulations governing
6 examinations and tests required for the discovery in infants of preventable or
7 inheritable disorders. Existing law further requires any physician, midwife, nurse,
8 freestanding birthing center or hospital of any nature attending or assisting any
9 infant, or the person who gave birth to any infant, at childbirth to: (1) examine the
10 infant in accordance with those regulations; and (2) collect and send to the State
11 Public Health Laboratory any specimens needed for the examinations and tests that
12 must be performed by a laboratory. (NRS 442.008) Section 3 of this bill authorizes
13 the State Public Health Laboratory, on or after January 1, 2026, to charge a fee of
14 not more than $150 or the rate of reimbursement paid by Medicaid, whichever is
-

– 2 –
15 less, for the required examinations and tests for the discovery in infants of
16 preventable or inheritable disorders. Section 1 of this bill makes a conforming
17 change to clarify that the State Public Health Laboratory establishes the fee for such
18 examinations and tests pursuant to section 3. Section 68.7 of this bill authorizes the
19 State Public Health Laboratory, on or after July 1, 2025 and before January 1, 2026,
20 to charge a fee of not more than $122 for the required examinations and tests for
21 the discovery in infants of preventable or inheritable disorders.
22 Existing law requires the Department of Health and Human Services to
23 administer the Medicaid program. (NRS 422.270) Section 3.7 of this bill requires
24 the Director of the Department to provide reimbursement under Medicaid for the
25 required examinations and tests for the discovery in infants of preventable or
26 inheritable disorders separately from the reimbursement provided for other labor
27 and delivery services and newborn care. Section 3.4 of this bill makes a
28 conforming change to indicate that the provisions of section 3.7 will be
29 administered in the same manner as the provisions of existing law governing
30 Medicaid. Section 68.3 of this bill requires the Director to submit to the United
31 States Secretary of Health and Human Services, to the extent that money is
32 available and as soon as practicable, a request to include under Medicaid a rate of
33 reimbursement of not more than $122 for such examinations and tests. Sections 3.7
34 and 68.3 authorize the Director to increase that rate of reimbursement to not more
35 than $150 on or after January 1, 2026.

45 regulations adopted pursuant to subsection 1 concerning tests for the
