AN ACT relating to health care; establishing a fee [to be charged by] the State
Public Health Laboratory is authorized to charge for certain
examinations and tests [;] for the discovery of certain diseases in
infants; requiring Medicaid to reimburse such examinations and
tests separately from reimbursement for other labor and delivery
services and newborn care; requiring the Director of the
Department of Health and Human Services to request the
establishment of a certain rate of reimbursement for such
examinations and tests; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the State Public Health Laboratory to make available, at such
2 charges as may be established, to health officials, the Director of the State Department of
3 Agriculture and licensed physicians of the State, proper laboratory facilities for the prompt
4 diagnosis of communicable diseases. (NRS 439.240) Existing law requires the State Board of
5 Health to adopt regulations governing examinations and tests required for the discovery in
6 infants of preventable or inheritable disorders. Existing law further requires any physician,
7 midwife, nurse, freestanding birthing center or hospital of any nature attending or assisting
8 any infant, or the person who gave birth to any infant, at childbirth to: (1) examine the infant
9 in accordance with those regulations; and (2) collect and send to the State Public Health
10 Laboratory any specimens needed for the examinations and tests that must be performed by a
11 laboratory. (NRS 442.008) Section 3 of this bill [requires] authorizes the State Public Health
12 Laboratory , on or after January 1, 2026, to charge a fee of not more than $150 or the rate
13 of reimbursement paid by Medicaid, whichever is less, for the required examinations and
14 tests for the discovery in infants of preventable or inheritable disorders. Section 1 of this bill
15 makes a conforming change to clarify that the State Public Health Laboratory [is not
16 authorized to establish a fee for the services for which a] establishes the fee [is fixed by] for
17 such examinations and tests pursuant to section 3. Section 68.7 of this bill authorizes the
18 State Public Health Laboratory, on or after July 1, 2025 and before January 1, 2026, to

Assembly Amendment No. 597 to Senate Bill No. 348 First Reprint Page 4
19 charge a fee of not more than $122 for the required examinations and tests for the
20 discovery in infants of preventable or inheritable disorders.
21 Existing law requires the Department of Health and Human Services to administer
22 the Medicaid program. (NRS 422.270) Section 3.7 of this bill requires the Director of the
23 Department to provide reimbursement under Medicaid for the required examinations
24 and tests for the discovery in infants of preventable or inheritable disorders separately
25 from the reimbursement provided for other labor and delivery services and newborn
26 care. Section 3.4 of this bill makes a conforming change to indicate that the provisions of
27 section 3.7 will be administered in the same manner as the provisions of existing law
28 governing Medicaid. Section 68.3 of this bill requires the Director to submit to the
29 United States Secretary of Health and Human Services, to the extent that money is
30 available and as soon as practicable, a request to include under Medicaid a rate of
31 reimbursement of not more than $122 for such examinations and tests. Sections 3.7 and
32 68.3 authorize the Director to increase that rate of reimbursement to not more than $150
33 on or after January 1, 2026.
