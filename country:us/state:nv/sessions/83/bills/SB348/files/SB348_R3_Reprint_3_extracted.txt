EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; establishing a fee the State Public
Health Laboratory is authorized to charge for certain
examinations and tests for the discovery of certain
diseases in infants; removing a requirement that the State
Public Health Laboratory hold a public hearing under
certain circumstances; requiring Medicaid to reimburse
such examinations and tests separately from
reimbursement for other labor and delivery services and
newborn care; requiring the Director of the Department of
Health and Human Services to request the establishment
of a certain rate of reimbursement for such examinations
and tests; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the State Public Health Laboratory to make available, at
2 such charges as may be established, to health officials, the Director of the State
3 Department of Agriculture and licensed physicians of the State, proper laboratory
4 facilities for the prompt diagnosis of communicable diseases. (NRS 439.240)
5 Existing law requires the State Board of Health to adopt regulations governing
6 examinations and tests required for the discovery in infants of preventable or
7 inheritable disorders. Existing law further requires any physician, midwife, nurse,
8 freestanding birthing center or hospital of any nature attending or assisting any
9 infant, or the person who gave birth to any infant, at childbirth to: (1) examine the
10 infant in accordance with those regulations; and (2) collect and send to the State
-

– 2 –
11 Public Health Laboratory any specimens needed for the examinations and tests that
12 must be performed by a laboratory. (NRS 442.008) Section 3 of this bill authorizes
13 the State Public Health Laboratory, on or after January 1, 2026, to charge a fee of
14 not more than $150 or the rate of reimbursement paid by Medicaid, whichever is
15 less, for the required examinations and tests for the discovery in infants of
16 preventable or inheritable disorders. Section 1 of this bill makes a conforming
17 change to clarify that the State Public Health Laboratory establishes the fee for such
18 examinations and tests pursuant to section 3. Section 3 also removes a requirement
19 that the State Public Health Laboratory hold a public hearing before increasing that
20 fee. Section 68.7 of this bill authorizes the State Public Health Laboratory, on or
21 after July 1, 2025, and before January 1, 2026, to charge a fee of not more than
22 $122 for the required examinations and tests for the discovery in infants of
23 preventable or inheritable disorders.
24 Existing law requires the Department of Health and Human Services to
25 administer the Medicaid program. (NRS 422.270) Section 3.7 of this bill requires
26 the Director of the Department to provide reimbursement under Medicaid for the
27 required examinations and tests for the discovery in infants of preventable or
28 inheritable disorders separately from the reimbursement provided for other labor
29 and delivery services and newborn care. Section 3.4 of this bill makes a
30 conforming change to indicate that the provisions of section 3.7 will be
31 administered in the same manner as the provisions of existing law governing
32 Medicaid. Section 68.3 of this bill requires the Director to submit to the United
33 States Secretary of Health and Human Services, to the extent that money is
34 available and as soon as practicable, a request to include under Medicaid a rate of
35 reimbursement of not more than $122 for such examinations and tests. Sections 3.7
36 and 68.3 authorize the Director to increase that rate of reimbursement to not more
37 than $150 on or after January 1, 2026.

11 Public Health Laboratory any specimens needed for the examinations and tests that
12 must be performed by a laboratory. (NRS 442.008) Section 3 of this bill authorizes
13 the State Public Health Laboratory, on or after January 1, 2026, to charge a fee of
14 not more than $150 or the rate of reimbursement paid by Medicaid, whichever is
15 less, for the required examinations and tests for the discovery in infants of
16 preventable or inheritable disorders. Section 1 of this bill makes a conforming
17 change to clarify that the State Public Health Laboratory establishes the fee for such
18 examinations and tests pursuant to section 3. Section 3 also removes a requirement
19 that the State Public Health Laboratory hold a public hearing before increasing that
20 fee. Section 68.7 of this bill authorizes the State Public Health Laboratory, on or
21 after July 1, 2025, and before January 1, 2026, to charge a fee of not more than
22 $122 for the required examinations and tests for the discovery in infants of
23 preventable or inheritable disorders.
24 Existing law requires the Department of Health and Human Services to
25 administer the Medicaid program. (NRS 422.270) Section 3.7 of this bill requires
26 the Director of the Department to provide reimbursement under Medicaid for the
27 required examinations and tests for the discovery in infants of preventable or
28 inheritable disorders separately from the reimbursement provided for other labor
29 and delivery services and newborn care. Section 3.4 of this bill makes a
30 conforming change to indicate that the provisions of section 3.7 will be
31 administered in the same manner as the provisions of existing law governing
32 Medicaid. Section 68.3 of this bill requires the Director to submit to the United
33 States Secretary of Health and Human Services, to the extent that money is
34 available and as soon as practicable, a request to include under Medicaid a rate of
35 reimbursement of not more than $122 for such examinations and tests. Sections 3.7
36 and 68.3 authorize the Director to increase that rate of reimbursement to not more
37 than $150 on or after January 1, 2026.
