EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; establishing a fee the State Public Health
Laboratory is authorized to charge for certain examinations and tests
for the discovery of certain diseases in infants; removing a
requirement that the State Public Health Laboratory hold a public
hearing under certain circumstances; requiring Medicaid to
reimburse such examinations and tests separately from reimbursement
for other labor and delivery services and newborn care; requiring the
Director of the Department of Health and Human Services to request
the establishment of a certain rate of reimbursement for such
examinations and tests; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the State Public Health Laboratory to make available, at such
2 charges as may be established, to health officials, the Director of the State Department of
3 Agriculture and licensed physicians of the State, proper laboratory facilities for the prompt
4 diagnosis of communicable diseases. (NRS 439.240) Existing law requires the State Board of
5 Health to adopt regulations governing examinations and tests required for the discovery in
6 infants of preventable or inheritable disorders. Existing law further requires any physician,
7 midwife, nurse, freestanding birthing center or hospital of any nature attending or assisting
8 any infant, or the person who gave birth to any infant, at childbirth to: (1) examine the infant
9 in accordance with those regulations; and (2) collect and send to the State Public Health
10 Laboratory any specimens needed for the examinations and tests that must be performed by a
11 laboratory. (NRS 442.008) Section 3 of this bill authorizes the State Public Health
12 Laboratory, on or after January 1, 2026, to charge a fee of not more than $150 or the rate of
13 reimbursement paid by Medicaid, whichever is less, for the required examinations and tests
14 for the discovery in infants of preventable or inheritable disorders. Section 1 of this bill makes
15 a conforming change to clarify that the State Public Health Laboratory establishes the fee for
16 such examinations and tests pursuant to section 3. Section 3 also removes a requirement
17 that the State Public Health Laboratory hold a public hearing before increasing that fee.
18 Section 68.7 of this bill authorizes the State Public Health Laboratory, on or after July 1,
Assembly Amendment No. 896 to Senate Bill No. 348 Second Reprint Page 4
19 2025, and before January 1, 2026, to charge a fee of not more than $122 for the required
20 examinations and tests for the discovery in infants of preventable or inheritable disorders.
21 Existing law requires the Department of Health and Human Services to administer the
22 Medicaid program. (NRS 422.270) Section 3.7 of this bill requires the Director of the
23 Department to provide reimbursement under Medicaid for the required examinations and tests
24 for the discovery in infants of preventable or inheritable disorders separately from the
25 reimbursement provided for other labor and delivery services and newborn care. Section 3.4
26 of this bill makes a conforming change to indicate that the provisions of section 3.7 will be
27 administered in the same manner as the provisions of existing law governing Medicaid.
28 Section 68.3 of this bill requires the Director to submit to the United States Secretary of
29 Health and Human Services, to the extent that money is available and as soon as practicable, a
30 request to include under Medicaid a rate of reimbursement of not more than $122 for such
31 examinations and tests. Sections 3.7 and 68.3 authorize the Director to increase that rate of
32 reimbursement to not more than $150 on or after January 1, 2026.

6 exclude any such disorder upon request of the Chief Medical Officer or the person

10 3. Any examination or test required by the regulations adopted pursuant to

35 (b) Collect and send to the State Public Health Laboratory or cause to be
36 collected and sent to the State Public Health Laboratory any specimens needed for
37 the examinations and tests that must be performed by a laboratory and are required

40 infant, the physician, midwife, nurse, freestanding birthing center or hospital
41 attending or assisting at the birth of the infant shall immediately:

AN ACT relating to health care; establishing a fee the State Public Health
Laboratory is authorized to charge for certain examinations and tests
for the discovery of certain diseases in infants; removing a
requirement that the State Public Health Laboratory hold a public
hearing under certain circumstances; requiring Medicaid to
reimburse such examinations and tests separately from reimbursement
for other labor and delivery services and newborn care; requiring the
Director of the Department of Health and Human Services to request
the establishment of a certain rate of reimbursement for such
examinations and tests; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the State Public Health Laboratory to make available, at such
2 charges as may be established, to health officials, the Director of the State Department of
3 Agriculture and licensed physicians of the State, proper laboratory facilities for the prompt
4 diagnosis of communicable diseases. (NRS 439.240) Existing law requires the State Board of
5 Health to adopt regulations governing examinations and tests required for the discovery in
6 infants of preventable or inheritable disorders. Existing law further requires any physician,
7 midwife, nurse, freestanding birthing center or hospital of any nature attending or assisting
8 any infant, or the person who gave birth to any infant, at childbirth to: (1) examine the infant
9 in accordance with those regulations; and (2) collect and send to the State Public Health
10 Laboratory any specimens needed for the examinations and tests that must be performed by a
11 laboratory. (NRS 442.008) Section 3 of this bill authorizes the State Public Health
12 Laboratory, on or after January 1, 2026, to charge a fee of not more than $150 or the rate of
13 reimbursement paid by Medicaid, whichever is less, for the required examinations and tests
14 for the discovery in infants of preventable or inheritable disorders. Section 1 of this bill makes
15 a conforming change to clarify that the State Public Health Laboratory establishes the fee for
16 such examinations and tests pursuant to section 3. Section 3 also removes a requirement
17 that the State Public Health Laboratory hold a public hearing before increasing that fee.
18 Section 68.7 of this bill authorizes the State Public Health Laboratory, on or after July 1,

Assembly Amendment No. 896 to Senate Bill No. 348 Second Reprint Page 4
19 2025, and before January 1, 2026, to charge a fee of not more than $122 for the required
20 examinations and tests for the discovery in infants of preventable or inheritable disorders.
21 Existing law requires the Department of Health and Human Services to administer the
22 Medicaid program. (NRS 422.270) Section 3.7 of this bill requires the Director of the
23 Department to provide reimbursement under Medicaid for the required examinations and tests
24 for the discovery in infants of preventable or inheritable disorders separately from the
25 reimbursement provided for other labor and delivery services and newborn care. Section 3.4
26 of this bill makes a conforming change to indicate that the provisions of section 3.7 will be
27 administered in the same manner as the provisions of existing law governing Medicaid.
28 Section 68.3 of this bill requires the Director to submit to the United States Secretary of
29 Health and Human Services, to the extent that money is available and as soon as practicable, a
30 request to include under Medicaid a rate of reimbursement of not more than $122 for such
31 examinations and tests. Sections 3.7 and 68.3 authorize the Director to increase that rate of
32 reimbursement to not more than $150 on or after January 1, 2026.

36 collected and sent to the State Public Health Laboratory any specimens needed for

40 infant, the physician, midwife, nurse, freestanding birthing center or hospital
41 attending or assisting at the birth of the infant shall immediately:
