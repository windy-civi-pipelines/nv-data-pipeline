EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to insurance; requiring certain health insurance to include
coverage for certain dental services when provided by certain dental
hygienists without the supervision of a dentist to the same extent as if
provided by a dental hygienist under the supervision of a dentist;
revising provisions governing the services that a dental hygienist
with a special endorsement to practice public health dental hygiene
may provide; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the Board of Dental Examiners of Nevada to issue to a licensed
2 dental hygienist who meets certain qualifications prescribed by the Board a special
3 endorsement that allows the dental hygienist to practice public health dental hygiene. Under
4 existing law, a dental hygienist who holds such a special endorsement is authorized to provide
5 services specified by the Board by regulation without the authorization or supervision of a
6 dentist. (NRS 631.287) Existing regulations of the Board set forth: (1) various services
7 that a dental hygienist who holds a special endorsement may provide without
8 authorization or supervision of a dentist; (2) certain conditions for the provision of such
9 services; and (3) the circumstances under which the authorization to provide such
10 services may be suspended or revoked. (NAC 631.210) Section 12.5 of this bill codifies
11 such authorized services, conditions and circumstances into statute.
12 Sections 1, 3-9, 11, 12 and 14-16 of this bill require certain public and private policies of
13 health insurance and health plans, including Medicaid, who provide coverage for a dental
14 service that a qualified dental hygienist [who has obtained a special endorsement] is
15 authorized to provide without the supervision of a dentist to provide coverage for that service
16 when provided by such a qualified dental hygienist without the supervision of a dentist to the
17 same extent as if provided by a qualified dental hygienist under the supervision of a dentist.
18 Sections 1, 3, 4, 6-8, 11, 12 and 16 define the term “qualified dental hygienist” to mean a
19 dental hygienist who holds a special endorsement to practice public health dental
20 hygiene, is employed by a nonprofit organization and provides services within the scope
21 of that employment.
22 Section 13 of this bill makes a conforming change to require the Director of the
23 Department of Health and Human Services to administer the provisions of section 16 in the

Senate Amendment No. 189 to Senate Bill No. 268 Page 4
24 same manner as other provisions relating to Medicaid. Section 2 of this bill authorizes the
25 Commissioner of Insurance to require that certain policies of health insurance issued by a
26 domestic insurer to a person who resides in another state include the coverage required by
27 section 1.
28 Section 10 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner to suspend or revoke the certificate of
29 authority of a health maintenance organization that fails to comply with the requirements of
30 section 8. The Commissioner would also be authorized to take such action against other
31 private health insurers and organizations for dental care that fail to comply with the
32 requirements of sections 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 11 and 12. (NRS 680A.200, 695D.300)
