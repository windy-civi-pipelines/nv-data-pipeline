Senate Bill No. 268–Senator Flores
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to insurance; requiring certain health insurance to
include coverage for certain dental services when provided
by certain dental hygienists without the supervision of a
dentist to the same extent as if provided by a dental hygienist
under the supervision of a dentist; revising provisions
governing the services that a dental hygienist with a special
endorsement to practice public health dental hygiene may
provide; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law authorizes the Board of Dental Examiners of Nevada to issue to a
licensed dental hygienist who meets certain qualifications prescribed by the Board a
special endorsement that allows the dental hygienist to practice public health dental
hygiene. Under existing law, a dental hygienist who holds such a special
endorsement is authorized to provide services specified by the Board by regulation
without the authorization or supervision of a dentist. (NRS 631.287) Existing
regulations of the Board set forth: (1) various services that a dental hygienist who
holds a special endorsement may provide without authorization or supervision of a
dentist; (2) certain conditions for the provision of such services; and (3) the
circumstances under which the authorization to provide such services may be
suspended or revoked. (NAC 631.210) Section 12.5 of this bill codifies such
authorized services, conditions and circumstances into statute.
Sections 1, 3-9, 11, 12 and 14-16 of this bill require certain public and private
policies of health insurance and health plans, including Medicaid, who provide
coverage for a dental service that a qualified dental hygienist is authorized to
provide without the supervision of a dentist to provide coverage for that service
when provided by such a qualified dental hygienist without the supervision of a
dentist to the same extent as if provided by a qualified dental hygienist under the
supervision of a dentist. Sections 1, 3, 4, 6-8, 11, 12 and 16 define the term
“qualified dental hygienist” to mean a dental hygienist who holds a special
endorsement to practice public health dental hygiene, is employed by a nonprofit
organization and provides services within the scope of that employment.
Section 13 of this bill makes a conforming change to require the Director of the
Department of Health and Human Services to administer the provisions of section
16 in the same manner as other provisions relating to Medicaid. Section 2 of this
bill authorizes the Commissioner of Insurance to require that certain policies of
health insurance issued by a domestic insurer to a person who resides in another
state include the coverage required by section 1.
Section 10 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner to suspend or revoke the
certificate of authority of a health maintenance organization that fails to comply
with the requirements of section 8. The Commissioner would also be authorized to
take such action against other private health insurers and organizations for dental
care that fail to comply with the requirements of sections 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 11 and 12.
