EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to insurance; requiring certain health insurance to
include coverage for certain dental services when
provided by certain dental hygienists without the
supervision of a dentist to the same extent as if provided
by a dental hygienist under the supervision of a dentist;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the Board of Dental Examiners of Nevada to issue to a
2 licensed dental hygienist who meets certain qualifications prescribed by the Board a
3 special endorsement that allows the dental hygienist to practice public health dental
4 hygiene. Under existing law, a dental hygienist who holds such a special
5 endorsement is authorized to provide services specified by the Board by regulation
6 without the authorization or supervision of a dentist. (NRS 631.287)
7 Sections 1, 3-9, 11, 12 and 14-16 of this bill require certain public and private
8 policies of health insurance and health plans, including Medicaid, who provide
9 coverage for a dental service that a dental hygienist who has obtained a special
10 endorsement is authorized to provide without the supervision of a dentist to provide
11 coverage for that service when provided by such a dental hygienist without the
12 supervision of a dentist to the same extent as if provided by a dental hygienist under
13 the supervision of a dentist.
14 Section 13 of this bill makes a conforming change to require the Director of the
15 Department of Health and Human Services to administer the provisions of section
16 16 in the same manner as other provisions relating to Medicaid. Section 2 of this
17 bill authorizes the Commissioner of Insurance to require that certain policies of
18 health insurance issued by a domestic insurer to a person who resides in another
19 state include the coverage required by section 1.

20 Section 10 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner to suspend or revoke the
21 certificate of authority of a health maintenance organization that fails to comply
22 with the requirements of section 8. The Commissioner would also be authorized to
23 take such action against other private health insurers and organizations for dental
24 care that fail to comply with the requirements of sections 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 11 and 12.

S.B. 268
SENATE BILL NO. 268–SENATOR FLORES
MARCH 4, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Commerce and Labor
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to insurance coverage for
certain dental services. (BDR 57-329)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
CONTAINS UNFUNDED MANDATE (§ 14)
(NOT REQUESTED BY AFFECTED LOCAL GOVERNMENT)
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to insurance; requiring certain health insurance to
include coverage for certain dental services when
provided by certain dental hygienists without the
supervision of a dentist to the same extent as if provided
by a dental hygienist under the supervision of a dentist;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the Board of Dental Examiners of Nevada to issue to a
2 licensed dental hygienist who meets certain qualifications prescribed by the Board a
3 special endorsement that allows the dental hygienist to practice public health dental
4 hygiene. Under existing law, a dental hygienist who holds such a special
5 endorsement is authorized to provide services specified by the Board by regulation
6 without the authorization or supervision of a dentist. (NRS 631.287)
7 Sections 1, 3-9, 11, 12 and 14-16 of this bill require certain public and private
8 policies of health insurance and health plans, including Medicaid, who provide
9 coverage for a dental service that a dental hygienist who has obtained a special
10 endorsement is authorized to provide without the supervision of a dentist to provide
11 coverage for that service when provided by such a dental hygienist without the
12 supervision of a dentist to the same extent as if provided by a dental hygienist under
13 the supervision of a dentist.
14 Section 13 of this bill makes a conforming change to require the Director of the
15 Department of Health and Human Services to administer the provisions of section
16 16 in the same manner as other provisions relating to Medicaid. Section 2 of this
17 bill authorizes the Commissioner of Insurance to require that certain policies of
18 health insurance issued by a domestic insurer to a person who resides in another
19 state include the coverage required by section 1.

20 Section 10 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner to suspend or revoke the
21 certificate of authority of a health maintenance organization that fails to comply
22 with the requirements of section 8. The Commissioner would also be authorized to
23 take such action against other private health insurers and organizations for dental
24 care that fail to comply with the requirements of sections 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 11 and 12.
