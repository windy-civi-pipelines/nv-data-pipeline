EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to insurance; requiring certain health insurance to
include coverage for certain dental services when
provided by certain dental hygienists without the
supervision of a dentist to the same extent as if provided
by a dental hygienist under the supervision of a dentist;
revising provisions governing the services that a dental
hygienist with a special endorsement to practice public
health dental hygiene may provide; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the Board of Dental Examiners of Nevada to issue to a
2 licensed dental hygienist who meets certain qualifications prescribed by the Board a
3 special endorsement that allows the dental hygienist to practice public health dental
4 hygiene. Under existing law, a dental hygienist who holds such a special
5 endorsement is authorized to provide services specified by the Board by regulation
6 without the authorization or supervision of a dentist. (NRS 631.287) Existing
7 regulations of the Board set forth: (1) various services that a dental hygienist who
8 holds a special endorsement may provide without authorization or supervision of a
9 dentist; (2) certain conditions for the provision of such services; and (3) the
10 circumstances under which the authorization to provide such services may be
11 suspended or revoked. (NAC 631.210) Section 12.5 of this bill codifies such
12 authorized services, conditions and circumstances into statute.
13 Sections 1, 3-9, 11, 12 and 14-16 of this bill require certain public and private
14 policies of health insurance and health plans, including Medicaid, who provide
15 coverage for a dental service that a qualified dental hygienist is authorized to
16 provide without the supervision of a dentist to provide coverage for that service
-

– 2 –
17 when provided by such a qualified dental hygienist without the supervision of a
18 dentist to the same extent as if provided by a qualified dental hygienist under the
19 supervision of a dentist. Sections 1, 3, 4, 6-8, 11, 12 and 16 define the term
20 “qualified dental hygienist” to mean a dental hygienist who holds a special
21 endorsement to practice public health dental hygiene, is employed by a nonprofit
22 organization and provides services within the scope of that employment.
23 Section 13 of this bill makes a conforming change to require the Director of the
24 Department of Health and Human Services to administer the provisions of section
25 16 in the same manner as other provisions relating to Medicaid. Section 2 of this
26 bill authorizes the Commissioner of Insurance to require that certain policies of
27 health insurance issued by a domestic insurer to a person who resides in another
28 state include the coverage required by section 1.
29 Section 10 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner to suspend or revoke the
30 certificate of authority of a health maintenance organization that fails to comply
31 with the requirements of section 8. The Commissioner would also be authorized to
32 take such action against other private health insurers and organizations for dental
33 care that fail to comply with the requirements of sections 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 11 and 12.
