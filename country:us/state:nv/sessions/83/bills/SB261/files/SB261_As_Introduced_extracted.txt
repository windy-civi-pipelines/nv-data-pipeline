~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to housing; authorizing certain persons to file a
complaint to request that a sheriff remove an unlawful or
unauthorized occupant of a dwelling on the real property
of the person; requiring the Administrator of the Housing
Division of the Department of Business and Industry to
prescribe by regulation a form to authorize a local law
enforcement agency to enter certain properties that are
listed for sale when a person forcibly enters or detains
such a property; authorizing a sheriff to collect certain
fees for serving a notice to vacate and for performing
certain other actions; revising the crime of forcible
detainer; providing penalties; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth certain procedures for the removal of a person who is
2 guilty of forcible entry or forcible detainer. (NRS 40.230, 40.240, 40.414) Under
3 this process, the owner of the real property, an authorized representative of the
4 owner or the occupant who is authorized by the owner to be in possession of the
5 real property is required to serve a notice to surrender on an unlawful or
6 unauthorized occupant who committed the forcible entry or forcible detainer. After
7 a notice to surrender is served, the unlawful or unauthorized occupant is required
8 to: (1) surrender the real property; (2) request that a court stay the execution of a
-
*SB261*
– 2 –
9 summary order for removal; or (3) contest the matter by filing, within a certain
10 period of time, an affidavit with the court. After the notice to surrender has expired,
11 the owner of the real property or authorized representative or occupant may apply
12 by affidavit of complaint for eviction to the court, which may, upon review of the
13 affidavits or upon a hearing, take certain actions including ordering the removal of
14 the unlawful or unauthorized occupant. (NRS 40.414)
15 In lieu of following this procedure, section 2 of this bill authorizes an owner of
16 real property, an authorized representative of the owner or the occupant who is
17 authorized by the owner to be in possession of the real property to submit a written
18 complaint to request that the sheriff remove an unlawful or unauthorized occupant
19 who forcibly enters or detains a dwelling on the property of the owner if: (1) the
20 real property was not open to the public at the time the forcible entry or detainer
21 occurred or the owner of the real property or authorized representative or occupant
22 directed the unlawful or unauthorized occupant to surrender the real property; (2)
23 the unlawful or unauthorized occupant is not the current or former tenant of the
24 dwelling, an owner or co-owner of the real property and is not listed on the title,
25 and is not an immediate family member of the owner of the real property; and (3)
26 there is no pending litigation related to the real property between the owner of the
27 real property and the unlawful or unauthorized occupant. Section 2 prescribes the
28 form of such a complaint and requires the sheriff to verify the complaint. After
29 the sheriff verifies the complaint, the sheriff is required to serve a notice to vacate
30 and perform certain other acts. Section 2 authorizes a sheriff to charge certain fees
31 for: (1) serving such a notice; and (2) at the request of the owner of the real
32 property, remaining at the real property while the owner of the real property
33 performs certain actions to regain possession of the real property. A person who
34 submits a false statement or claim made on a form completed pursuant to section 2
35 is guilty of perjury, which is a category D felony. (NRS 199.120)
36 Existing law provides that a person is guilty of forcible detainer if the person:
37 (1) unlawfully holds and keeps the possession of any real property by force or
38 threats of violence; or (2) enters real property without the authority of certain
39 persons and who, after receiving notice to surrender, fails to surrender the property.
40 (NRS 40.240) Section 6 of this bill provides that a person who fails to surrender
41 any real property after receiving notice to vacate pursuant to section 2 is also guilty
42 of forcible detainer.
43 Section 3 of this bill requires the Administrator of the Housing Division of the
44 Department of Business and Industry to prescribe by regulation the content of and
45 instructions for completing a form for a seller of certain real property to authorize a
46 local law enforcement agency to enter the real property if a person has forcibly
47 entered or detained a dwelling on the real property. The Administrator must provide
48 the form to title companies, real estate brokers and real estate salespersons in this
49 State for distribution to sellers of real property. Section 3 authorizes the
50 Administrator to consult with sheriffs and local law enforcement officials in this
51 State regarding the contents of the form. Additionally, section 3 authorizes a local
52 law enforcement agency to distribute the form at any time.
53 Section 4 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law governing summary
54 proceedings for obtaining possession of real property to the provisions of sections 2
55 and 3.
56 Sections 5 and 6 of this bill make conforming changes to authorize certain
57 persons to use the procedure set forth in section 2, in lieu of the procedures set
58 forth in existing law, for the removal of a person who is guilty of forcible entry and
59 forcible detainer.
60 Section 7 of this bill makes a conforming change to authorize a sheriff to
61 collect certain fees under section 2.

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to housing; authorizing certain persons to file a
complaint to request that a sheriff remove an unlawful or
unauthorized occupant of a dwelling on the real property
of the person; requiring the Administrator of the Housing
Division of the Department of Business and Industry to
prescribe by regulation a form to authorize a local law
enforcement agency to enter certain properties that are
listed for sale when a person forcibly enters or detains
such a property; authorizing a sheriff to collect certain
fees for serving a notice to vacate and for performing
certain other actions; revising the crime of forcible
detainer; providing penalties; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth certain procedures for the removal of a person who is
2 guilty of forcible entry or forcible detainer. (NRS 40.230, 40.240, 40.414) Under
3 this process, the owner of the real property, an authorized representative of the
4 owner or the occupant who is authorized by the owner to be in possession of the
5 real property is required to serve a notice to surrender on an unlawful or
6 unauthorized occupant who committed the forcible entry or forcible detainer. After
7 a notice to surrender is served, the unlawful or unauthorized occupant is required
8 to: (1) surrender the real property; (2) request that a court stay the execution of a
-
*SB261*

– 2 –
9 summary order for removal; or (3) contest the matter by filing, within a certain
10 period of time, an affidavit with the court. After the notice to surrender has expired,
11 the owner of the real property or authorized representative or occupant may apply
12 by affidavit of complaint for eviction to the court, which may, upon review of the
13 affidavits or upon a hearing, take certain actions including ordering the removal of
14 the unlawful or unauthorized occupant. (NRS 40.414)
15 In lieu of following this procedure, section 2 of this bill authorizes an owner of
16 real property, an authorized representative of the owner or the occupant who is
17 authorized by the owner to be in possession of the real property to submit a written
18 complaint to request that the sheriff remove an unlawful or unauthorized occupant
19 who forcibly enters or detains a dwelling on the property of the owner if: (1) the
20 real property was not open to the public at the time the forcible entry or detainer
21 occurred or the owner of the real property or authorized representative or occupant
22 directed the unlawful or unauthorized occupant to surrender the real property; (2)
23 the unlawful or unauthorized occupant is not the current or former tenant of the
24 dwelling, an owner or co-owner of the real property and is not listed on the title,
25 and is not an immediate family member of the owner of the real property; and (3)
26 there is no pending litigation related to the real property between the owner of the
27 real property and the unlawful or unauthorized occupant. Section 2 prescribes the
28 form of such a complaint and requires the sheriff to verify the complaint. After
29 the sheriff verifies the complaint, the sheriff is required to serve a notice to vacate
30 and perform certain other acts. Section 2 authorizes a sheriff to charge certain fees
31 for: (1) serving such a notice; and (2) at the request of the owner of the real
32 property, remaining at the real property while the owner of the real property
33 performs certain actions to regain possession of the real property. A person who
34 submits a false statement or claim made on a form completed pursuant to section 2
35 is guilty of perjury, which is a category D felony. (NRS 199.120)
36 Existing law provides that a person is guilty of forcible detainer if the person:
37 (1) unlawfully holds and keeps the possession of any real property by force or
38 threats of violence; or (2) enters real property without the authority of certain
39 persons and who, after receiving notice to surrender, fails to surrender the property.
40 (NRS 40.240) Section 6 of this bill provides that a person who fails to surrender
41 any real property after receiving notice to vacate pursuant to section 2 is also guilty
42 of forcible detainer.
43 Section 3 of this bill requires the Administrator of the Housing Division of the
44 Department of Business and Industry to prescribe by regulation the content of and
45 instructions for completing a form for a seller of certain real property to authorize a
46 local law enforcement agency to enter the real property if a person has forcibly
47 entered or detained a dwelling on the real property. The Administrator must provide
48 the form to title companies, real estate brokers and real estate salespersons in this
49 State for distribution to sellers of real property. Section 3 authorizes the
50 Administrator to consult with sheriffs and local law enforcement officials in this
51 State regarding the contents of the form. Additionally, section 3 authorizes a local
52 law enforcement agency to distribute the form at any time.
53 Section 4 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law governing summary
54 proceedings for obtaining possession of real property to the provisions of sections 2
55 and 3.
56 Sections 5 and 6 of this bill make conforming changes to authorize certain
57 persons to use the procedure set forth in section 2, in lieu of the procedures set
58 forth in existing law, for the removal of a person who is guilty of forcible entry and
59 forcible detainer.
60 Section 7 of this bill makes a conforming change to authorize a sheriff to
61 collect certain fees under section 2.
