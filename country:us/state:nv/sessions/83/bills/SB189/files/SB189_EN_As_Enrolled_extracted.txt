CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to genetic counseling; prescribing certain duties
and authority of a genetic counselor; providing for the
regulation of the practice of genetic counseling by the Board
of Medical Examiners; requiring the appointment of the
Genetic Counseling Advisory Council; prescribing the
requirements for the issuance and renewal of a license as a
genetic counselor; authorizing the Board to take certain
actions to investigate and impose discipline against a genetic
counselor; prohibiting the unlicensed practice of genetic
counseling except in certain circumstances; establishing a
privilege for certain confidential communications; providing
penalties; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of physicians, physician
assistants, anesthesiologist assistants, perfusionists and practitioners of respiratory
care by the Board of Medical Examiners. (Chapter 630 of NRS) This bill
additionally provides for the licensure and regulation of genetic counselors by the
Board. Sections 4-5.6 of this bill define certain terms, and section 14 of this bill
establishes the applicability of those definitions. Section 40 of this bill makes it a
felony for a person to practice genetic counseling or hold himself or herself out as a
genetic counselor without a license. Section 7 of this bill prescribes the
requirements to obtain such a license, including obtaining certain education,
passing certain examinations and obtaining certification from the American Board
of Genetic Counseling. Section 8 of this bill authorizes the Board to issue a
temporary license under which a person who has obtained the required education
but has not yet passed the required examination or obtained the required
certification may engage in the supervised practice of genetic counseling. Section 6
of this bill requires the Board to adopt certain other regulations regarding the
licensure and practice of genetic counselors. Section 9 of this bill authorizes certain
unlicensed persons to provide assistance or consulting services related to genetic
counseling, and section 16 of this bill exempts a genetic counselor of the Federal
Government and permitted practitioners of other healing arts who are authorized to
provide genetic counseling from licensure and regulation by the Board. Section 9
also authorizes a physician or a physician assistant to engage in genetic counseling
as part of his or her practice without obtaining a license as a genetic counselor.

Section 2:
Section 10 of this bill prescribes the date on which a license as a genetic counselor
expires and the requirements to renew such a license. Section 23 of this bill
prescribes the maximum fees that the Board may charge for the issuance or renewal
of a license or a temporary license as a genetic counselor. Section 11 of this bill
prescribes the procedure for the voluntary surrender of such a license.

Section 3:
Section 12 of this bill prescribes the grounds for disciplinary action against a
genetic counselor. Sections 24, 25 and 27 of this bill apply to genetic counselors
the existing process for the filing of a complaint with the Board concerning a
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 2 –
licensee or notifying the Board of certain actions taken against a licensee. Sections
26, 28-33, 36 and 38 of this bill apply to genetic counselors: (1) existing
procedures for the investigation of complaints and the imposition of disciplinary
action against licensees; and (2) certain other existing procedures to address
incompetence or misconduct by a licensee. Section 34 of this bill applies to genetic
counselors the existing procedure to remove limitations that the Board has placed
on a license or to restore a revoked license. Sections 36, 37, 39 and 40 of this bill
authorize or require the Board to take certain actions against a person who is
practicing genetic counseling or holding himself or herself out as a genetic
counselor without a license.

Section 4:
Sections 13, 15 and 19-21 of this bill make various conforming changes so that
genetic counselors are treated similarly to other providers of health care licensed by
the Board for certain purposes related to licensure and regulation. Section 17 of this
bill deems any act that constitutes the practice of genetic counseling to occur where
the patient is located at the time the act is performed. Section 5.9 of this bill
requires the Board to appoint the Genetic Counseling Advisory Council to advise
the Board concerning the regulation of genetic counseling until January 1, 2031.
After that date, section 18 of this bill authorizes the Board to select genetic
counselors to serve as advisory members of the Board. Sections 22 and 35 of this
bill subject genetic counselors to certain provisions required by federal law for the
enforcement of child support obligations. (42 U.S.C. § 666)
Existing law defines the term “provider of health care” to mean a person who
practices any of certain professions related to the provision of health care. (NRS

Section 5:
629.031) Existing law imposes certain requirements upon providers of health care,
including requirements for billing, standards for advertisements and criminal
penalties for acquiring certain debts. (NRS 629.071, 629.076, 629.078) Section 1 of
this bill includes genetic counselors in the definition of “provider of health care,”
thereby subjecting genetic counselors to those same requirements. Section 42 of
this bill requires a genetic counselor to report misconduct by a person licensed or
certified by the State Board of Nursing to the Executive Director of that Board.
Existing law establishes a privilege for confidential communications between a
patient and a physician, dentist or chiropractor or person participating in the
diagnosis or treatment of the patient under the direction of such a provider.
(NRS 49.215-49.245) Section 48 of this bill extends that same privilege to apply to
confidential communications between a patient and a genetic counselor or a person
under the direction of a genetic counselor.
Existing law provides that: (1) assault is generally a misdemeanor, with certain
exceptions; and (2) assault upon a provider of health care is a gross misdemeanor or
felony, depending on the circumstances. (NRS 200.471) Section 51 of this bill
includes a genetic counselor within the definition of “provider of health care” for
that purpose, thereby making assault upon a genetic counselor a gross misdemeanor
or felony, depending on the circumstances. Section 52 of this bill requires a genetic
counselor to report the abuse, neglect, exploitation, isolation or abandonment of an
older person or vulnerable person or the abuse or neglect of a child in the same
manner as other providers of health care. A genetic counselor would also be
required to report the abuse, neglect or commercial sexual exploitation of a child.
(NRS 432B.220, 432C.110) Sections 41, 43 and 44 of this bill provide that a
genetic counselor acting within his or her scope of practice is not violating
provisions governing certain other providers of health care. Sections 2, 45-47, 49,
50 and 53-59 of this bill make revisions to treat genetic counselors in the same
manner as other similar providers of health care in other certain respects.

4. In entering a judgment ordering the payment of future
damages by periodic payments pursuant to subsection 3, the court
shall make a specific finding as to the dollar amount of periodic
payments that will compensate the judgment creditor for such future
damages. As a condition to authorizing periodic payments of future
damages, the court shall require a judgment debtor who is not
adequately insured to post security adequate to assure full payment
of such damages awarded by the judgment. Upon termination of

of this security, or so much as remains, to the judgment debtor.

Such payments must only be subject to modification in the event of
the death of the judgment creditor. Money damages awarded for loss
of future earnings must not be reduced or payments terminated by
reason of the death of the judgment creditor, but must be paid to
persons to whom the judgment creditor owed a duty of support, as
provided by law, immediately before the judgment creditor’s death.
In such cases, the court that rendered the original judgment may,
upon petition of any party in interest, modify the judgment to award
and apportion the unpaid future damages in accordance with this
subsection.

6. If the court finds that the judgment debtor has exhibited a

Raw Text:
Senate Bill No. 189–Senators Lange; Cannizzaro,
Cruz-Crawford, Daly, Flores, Neal, Ohrenschall, Pazina,
Scheible and Taylor
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to genetic counseling; prescribing certain duties
and authority of a genetic counselor; providing for the
regulation of the practice of genetic counseling by the Board
of Medical Examiners; requiring the appointment of the
Genetic Counseling Advisory Council; prescribing the
requirements for the issuance and renewal of a license as a
genetic counselor; authorizing the Board to take certain
actions to investigate and impose discipline against a genetic
counselor; prohibiting the unlicensed practice of genetic
counseling except in certain circumstances; establishing a
privilege for certain confidential communications; providing
penalties; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of physicians, physician
assistants, anesthesiologist assistants, perfusionists and practitioners of respiratory
care by the Board of Medical Examiners. (Chapter 630 of NRS) This bill
additionally provides for the licensure and regulation of genetic counselors by the
Board. Sections 4-5.6 of this bill define certain terms, and section 14 of this bill
establishes the applicability of those definitions. Section 40 of this bill makes it a
felony for a person to practice genetic counseling or hold himself or herself out as a
genetic counselor without a license. Section 7 of this bill prescribes the
requirements to obtain such a license, including obtaining certain education,
passing certain examinations and obtaining certification from the American Board
of Genetic Counseling. Section 8 of this bill authorizes the Board to issue a
temporary license under which a person who has obtained the required education
but has not yet passed the required examination or obtained the required
certification may engage in the supervised practice of genetic counseling. Section 6
of this bill requires the Board to adopt certain other regulations regarding the
licensure and practice of genetic counselors. Section 9 of this bill authorizes certain
unlicensed persons to provide assistance or consulting services related to genetic
counseling, and section 16 of this bill exempts a genetic counselor of the Federal
Government and permitted practitioners of other healing arts who are authorized to
provide genetic counseling from licensure and regulation by the Board. Section 9
also authorizes a physician or a physician assistant to engage in genetic counseling
as part of his or her practice without obtaining a license as a genetic counselor.
Section 10 of this bill prescribes the date on which a license as a genetic counselor
expires and the requirements to renew such a license. Section 23 of this bill
prescribes the maximum fees that the Board may charge for the issuance or renewal
of a license or a temporary license as a genetic counselor. Section 11 of this bill
prescribes the procedure for the voluntary surrender of such a license.
Section 12 of this bill prescribes the grounds for disciplinary action against a
genetic counselor. Sections 24, 25 and 27 of this bill apply to genetic counselors
the existing process for the filing of a complaint with the Board concerning a
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 2 –
licensee or notifying the Board of certain actions taken against a licensee. Sections
26, 28-33, 36 and 38 of this bill apply to genetic counselors: (1) existing
procedures for the investigation of complaints and the imposition of disciplinary
action against licensees; and (2) certain other existing procedures to address
incompetence or misconduct by a licensee. Section 34 of this bill applies to genetic
counselors the existing procedure to remove limitations that the Board has placed
on a license or to restore a revoked license. Sections 36, 37, 39 and 40 of this bill
authorize or require the Board to take certain actions against a person who is
practicing genetic counseling or holding himself or herself out as a genetic
counselor without a license.
Sections 13, 15 and 19-21 of this bill make various conforming changes so that
genetic counselors are treated similarly to other providers of health care licensed by
the Board for certain purposes related to licensure and regulation. Section 17 of this
bill deems any act that constitutes the practice of genetic counseling to occur where
the patient is located at the time the act is performed. Section 5.9 of this bill
requires the Board to appoint the Genetic Counseling Advisory Council to advise
the Board concerning the regulation of genetic counseling until January 1, 2031.
After that date, section 18 of this bill authorizes the Board to select genetic
counselors to serve as advisory members of the Board. Sections 22 and 35 of this
bill subject genetic counselors to certain provisions required by federal law for the
enforcement of child support obligations. (42 U.S.C. § 666)
Existing law defines the term “provider of health care” to mean a person who
practices any of certain professions related to the provision of health care. (NRS
629.031) Existing law imposes certain requirements upon providers of health care,
including requirements for billing, standards for advertisements and criminal
penalties for acquiring certain debts. (NRS 629.071, 629.076, 629.078) Section 1 of
this bill includes genetic counselors in the definition of “provider of health care,”
thereby subjecting genetic counselors to those same requirements. Section 42 of
this bill requires a genetic counselor to report misconduct by a person licensed or
certified by the State Board of Nursing to the Executive Director of that Board.
Existing law establishes a privilege for confidential communications between a
patient and a physician, dentist or chiropractor or person participating in the
diagnosis or treatment of the patient under the direction of such a provider.
(NRS 49.215-49.245) Section 48 of this bill extends that same privilege to apply to
confidential communications between a patient and a genetic counselor or a person
under the direction of a genetic counselor.
Existing law provides that: (1) assault is generally a misdemeanor, with certain
exceptions; and (2) assault upon a provider of health care is a gross misdemeanor or
felony, depending on the circumstances. (NRS 200.471) Section 51 of this bill
includes a genetic counselor within the definition of “provider of health care” for
that purpose, thereby making assault upon a genetic counselor a gross misdemeanor
or felony, depending on the circumstances. Section 52 of this bill requires a genetic
counselor to report the abuse, neglect, exploitation, isolation or abandonment of an
older person or vulnerable person or the abuse or neglect of a child in the same
manner as other providers of health care. A genetic counselor would also be
required to report the abuse, neglect or commercial sexual exploitation of a child.
(NRS 432B.220, 432C.110) Sections 41, 43 and 44 of this bill provide that a
genetic counselor acting within his or her scope of practice is not violating
provisions governing certain other providers of health care. Sections 2, 45-47, 49,
50 and 53-59 of this bill make revisions to treat genetic counselors in the same
manner as other similar providers of health care in other certain respects.

creditor all damages caused by the failure to make such periodic
payments, including, but not limited to, court costs and attorney’s
