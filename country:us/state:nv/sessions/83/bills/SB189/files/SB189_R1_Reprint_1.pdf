AN ACT relating to genetic counseling; prescribing certain duties
and authority of a genetic counselor; providing for the
regulation of the practice of genetic counseling by the
Board of Medical Examiners; requiring the appointment
of the Genetic Counseling Advisory Council; prescribing
the requirements for the issuance and renewal of a license

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of physicians, physician
2 assistants, anesthesiologist assistants, perfusionists and practitioners of respiratory
3 care by the Board of Medical Examiners. (Chapter 630 of NRS) This bill
4 additionally provides for the licensure and regulation of genetic counselors by the
5 Board. Sections 4-5.6 of this bill define certain terms, and section 14 of this bill
6 establishes the applicability of those definitions. Section 40 of this bill makes it a
7 felony for a person to practice genetic counseling or hold himself or herself out as a
8 genetic counselor without a license. Section 7 of this bill prescribes the
-
*SB189_R1*

– 2 –
9 requirements to obtain such a license, including obtaining certain education,
10 passing certain examinations and obtaining certification from the American Board
11 of Genetic Counseling. Section 8 of this bill authorizes the Board to issue a
12 temporary license under which a person who has obtained the required education
13 but has not yet passed the required examination or obtained the required
14 certification may engage in the supervised practice of genetic counseling. Section 6
15 of this bill requires the Board to adopt certain other regulations regarding the
16 licensure and practice of genetic counselors. Section 9 of this bill authorizes certain
17 unlicensed persons to provide assistance or consulting services related to genetic
18 counseling, and section 16 of this bill exempts a genetic counselor of the Federal
19 Government and permitted practitioners of other healing arts who are authorized to
20 provide genetic counseling from licensure and regulation by the Board. Section 9
21 also authorizes a physician or a physician assistant to engage in genetic counseling
22 as part of his or her practice without obtaining a license as a genetic counselor.
23 Section 10 of this bill prescribes the date on which a license as a genetic counselor
24 expires and the requirements to renew such a license. Section 23 of this bill
25 prescribes the maximum fees that the Board may charge for the issuance or renewal
26 of a license or a temporary license as a genetic counselor. Section 11 of this bill
27 prescribes the procedure for the voluntary surrender of such a license.
28 Section 12 of this bill prescribes the grounds for disciplinary action against a
29 genetic counselor. Sections 24, 25 and 27 of this bill apply to genetic counselors
30 the existing process for the filing of a complaint with the Board concerning a
31 licensee or notifying the Board of certain actions taken against a licensee. Sections
32 26, 28-33, 36 and 38 of this bill apply to genetic counselors: (1) existing
33 procedures for the investigation of complaints and the imposition of disciplinary
34 action against licensees; and (2) certain other existing procedures to address
35 incompetence or misconduct by a licensee. Section 34 of this bill applies to genetic
36 counselors the existing procedure to remove limitations that the Board has placed
37 on a license or to restore a revoked license. Sections 36, 37, 39 and 40 of this bill
38 authorize or require the Board to take certain actions against a person who is
39 practicing genetic counseling or holding himself or herself out as a genetic
40 counselor without a license.
41 Sections 13, 15 and 19-21 of this bill make various conforming changes so that
42 genetic counselors are treated similarly to other providers of health care licensed by
43 the Board for certain purposes related to licensure and regulation. Section 17 of this
44 bill deems any act that constitutes the practice of genetic counseling to occur where
45 the patient is located at the time the act is performed. Section 5.9 of this bill
46 requires the Board to appoint the Genetic Counseling Advisory Council to advise
47 the Board concerning the regulation of genetic counseling until January 1, 2031.
48 After that date, section 18 of this bill authorizes the Board to select genetic
49 counselors to serve as advisory members of the Board. Sections 22 and 35 of this
50 bill subject genetic counselors to certain provisions required by federal law for the
51 enforcement of child support obligations. (42 U.S.C. § 666)
52 Existing law defines the term “provider of health care” to mean a person who
53 practices any of certain professions related to the provision of health care. (NRS
54 629.031) Existing law imposes certain requirements upon providers of health care,
55 including requirements for billing, standards for advertisements and criminal
56 penalties for acquiring certain debts. (NRS 629.071, 629.076, 629.078) Section 1 of
57 this bill includes genetic counselors in the definition of “provider of health care,”
58 thereby subjecting genetic counselors to those same requirements. Section 42 of
59 this bill requires a genetic counselor to report misconduct by a person licensed or
60 certified by the State Board of Nursing to the Executive Director of that Board.
61 Existing law establishes a privilege for confidential communications between a
62 patient and a physician, dentist or chiropractor or person participating in the
63 diagnosis or treatment of the patient under the direction of such a provider.
-
*SB189_R1*

– 3 –
64 (NRS 49.215-49.245) Section 48 of this bill extends that same privilege to apply to
65 confidential communications between a patient and a genetic counselor or a person
66 under the direction of a genetic counselor.
67 Existing law provides that: (1) assault is generally a misdemeanor, with certain
68 exceptions; and (2) assault upon a provider of health care is a gross misdemeanor or
69 felony, depending on the circumstances. (NRS 200.471) Section 51 of this bill
70 includes a genetic counselor within the definition of “provider of health care” for
71 that purpose, thereby making assault upon a genetic counselor a gross misdemeanor
72 or felony, depending on the circumstances. Section 52 of this bill requires a genetic
73 counselor to report the abuse, neglect, exploitation, isolation or abandonment of an
74 older person or vulnerable person or the abuse or neglect of a child in the same
75 manner as other providers of health care. A genetic counselor would also be
76 required to report the abuse, neglect or commercial sexual exploitation of a child.
77 (NRS 432B.220, 432C.110) Sections 41, 43 and 44 of this bill provide that a
78 genetic counselor acting within his or her scope of practice is not violating
79 provisions governing certain other providers of health care. Sections 2, 45-47, 49,
80 50 and 53-59 of this bill make revisions to treat genetic counselors in the same
81 manner as other similar providers of health care in other certain respects.

30 upon petition of any party in interest, modify the judgment to award
31 and apportion the unpaid future damages in accordance with this
32 subsection.

34 continuing pattern of failing to make the periodic payments as
35 specified pursuant to subsection 5, the court shall find the judgment
36 debtor in contempt of court and, in addition to the required periodic
37 payments, shall order the judgment debtor to pay the judgment
38 creditor all damages caused by the failure to make such periodic
39 payments, including, but not limited to, court costs and attorney’s
40 fees.
