EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to genetic counseling; prescribing certain duties and authority of
a genetic counselor; providing for the regulation of the practice of
genetic counseling by the Board of Medical Examiners; requiring the
appointment of the Genetic Counseling Advisory Council;
prescribing the requirements for the issuance and renewal of a license
as a genetic counselor; authorizing the Board to take certain actions to
investigate and impose discipline against a genetic counselor;
prohibiting the unlicensed practice of genetic counseling except in
certain circumstances; establishing a privilege for certain confidential
communications; providing penalties; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of physicians, physician assistants,
2 anesthesiologist assistants, perfusionists and practitioners of respiratory care by the Board of
3 Medical Examiners. (Chapter 630 of NRS) This bill additionally provides for the licensure
4 and regulation of genetic counselors by the Board. Sections [4 and 5] 4-5.6 of this bill define
5 [the] certain terms , [“genetic counseling” and “genetic counselor,” respectively,] and section
6 14 of this bill establishes the applicability of those definitions. Section 40 of this bill makes it
7 a felony for a person to practice genetic counseling or hold himself or herself out as a genetic
8 counselor without a license. Section 7 of this bill prescribes the requirements to obtain such a
9 license, including obtaining certain education, passing certain examinations and obtaining
10 certification from the American Board of Genetic Counseling. Section 8 of this bill authorizes
11 the Board to issue a temporary license under which a person who has obtained the required
12 education but has not yet passed the required examination or obtained the required
13 certification may engage in the supervised practice of genetic counseling. Section 6 of this bill
14 requires the Board to adopt certain other regulations regarding the licensure and practice of
15 genetic counselors. Section 9 of this bill authorizes certain unlicensed persons to provide
16 assistance or consulting services related to genetic counseling, and section 16 of this bill
Senate Amendment No. 35 to Senate Bill No. 189 Page 4
17 exempts a genetic counselor of the Federal Government and permitted practitioners of
18 other healing arts who are authorized to provide genetic counseling from licensure and
19 regulation by the Board. Section 9 also authorizes a physician or a physician assistant to
20 engage in genetic counseling as part of his or her practice without obtaining a license as a
21 genetic counselor. Section 10 of this bill prescribes the date on which a license as a genetic
22 counselor expires and the requirements to renew such a license. Section 23 of this bill
23 prescribes the maximum fees that the Board may charge for the issuance or renewal of a
24 license or a temporary license as a genetic counselor. Section 11 of this bill prescribes the
25 procedure for the voluntary surrender of such a license.
26 Section 12 of this bill prescribes the grounds for disciplinary action against a genetic
27 counselor. Sections 24, 25 and 27 of this bill apply to genetic counselors the existing process
28 for the filing of a complaint with the Board concerning a licensee or notifying the Board of
29 certain actions taken against a licensee. Sections 26, 28-33, 36 and 38 of this bill apply to
30 genetic counselors: (1) existing procedures for the investigation of complaints and the
31 imposition of disciplinary action against licensees; and (2) certain other existing procedures to
32 address incompetence or misconduct by a licensee. Section 34 of this bill applies to genetic
33 counselors the existing procedure to remove limitations that the Board has placed on a license
34 or to restore a revoked license. Sections 36, 37, 39 and 40 of this bill authorize or require the
35 Board to take certain actions against a person who is practicing genetic counseling or holding
36 himself or herself out as a genetic counselor without a license.
37 Sections 13, 15 and 19-21 of this bill make various conforming changes so that genetic
38 counselors are treated similarly to other providers of health care licensed by the Board for
39 certain purposes related to licensure and regulation. Section 17 of this bill deems any act that
40 constitutes the practice of genetic counseling to occur where the patient is located at the time
41 the act is performed. [Section] Section 5.9 of this bill requires the Board to appoint the
42 Genetic Counseling Advisory Council to advise the Board concerning the regulation of
43 genetic counseling until January 1, 2031. After that date, section 18 of this bill authorizes
44 the Board to select genetic counselors to serve as advisory members of the Board. Sections 22
45 and 35 of this bill subject genetic counselors to certain provisions required by federal law for
46 the enforcement of child support obligations. (42 U.S.C. § 666)
47 Existing law defines the term “provider of health care” to mean a person who practices
48 any of certain professions related to the provision of health care. (NRS 629.031) Existing law
49 imposes certain requirements upon providers of health care, including requirements for
50 billing, standards for advertisements and criminal penalties for acquiring certain debts. (NRS
51 629.071, 629.076, 629.078) Section 1 of this bill includes genetic counselors in the definition
52 of “provider of health care,” thereby subjecting genetic counselors to those same
53 requirements. Section 42 of this bill requires a genetic counselor to report misconduct by a
54 person licensed or certified by the State Board of Nursing to the Executive Director of that
55 Board.
56 Existing law establishes a privilege for confidential communications between a patient
57 and a physician, dentist or chiropractor or person participating in the diagnosis or treatment of
58 the patient under the direction of such a provider. (NRS 49.215-49.245) Section 48 of this bill
59 extends that same privilege to apply to confidential communications between a patient and a
60 genetic counselor or a person under the direction of a genetic counselor.
61 Existing law provides that: (1) assault is generally a misdemeanor, with certain
62 exceptions; and (2) assault upon a provider of health care is a gross misdemeanor or felony,
63 depending on the circumstances. (NRS 200.471) Section 51 of this bill includes a genetic
64 counselor within the definition of “provider of health care” for that purpose, thereby making
65 assault upon a genetic counselor a gross misdemeanor or felony, depending on the
66 circumstances. Section 52 of this bill requires a genetic counselor to report the abuse, neglect,
67 exploitation, isolation or abandonment of an older person or vulnerable person or the abuse or
68 neglect of a child in the same manner as other providers of health care. A genetic counselor
69 would also be required to report the abuse, neglect or commercial sexual exploitation of a
70 child. (NRS 432B.220, 432C.110) Sections 41, 43 and 44 of this bill provide that a genetic
71 counselor acting within his or her scope of practice is not violating provisions governing
72 certain other providers of health care. Sections 2, 45-47, 49, 50 and 53-59 of this bill make
73 revisions to treat genetic counselors in the same manner as other similar providers of health
74 care in other certain respects.

41 payments, including, but not limited to, court costs and attorney’s fees.

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to genetic counseling; prescribing certain duties and authority of
a genetic counselor; providing for the regulation of the practice of
genetic counseling by the Board of Medical Examiners; requiring the
appointment of the Genetic Counseling Advisory Council;
prescribing the requirements for the issuance and renewal of a license
as a genetic counselor; authorizing the Board to take certain actions to
investigate and impose discipline against a genetic counselor;
prohibiting the unlicensed practice of genetic counseling except in
certain circumstances; establishing a privilege for certain confidential
communications; providing penalties; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of physicians, physician assistants,
2 anesthesiologist assistants, perfusionists and practitioners of respiratory care by the Board of
3 Medical Examiners. (Chapter 630 of NRS) This bill additionally provides for the licensure
4 and regulation of genetic counselors by the Board. Sections [4 and 5] 4-5.6 of this bill define
5 [the] certain terms , [“genetic counseling” and “genetic counselor,” respectively,] and section
6 14 of this bill establishes the applicability of those definitions. Section 40 of this bill makes it
7 a felony for a person to practice genetic counseling or hold himself or herself out as a genetic
8 counselor without a license. Section 7 of this bill prescribes the requirements to obtain such a
9 license, including obtaining certain education, passing certain examinations and obtaining
10 certification from the American Board of Genetic Counseling. Section 8 of this bill authorizes
11 the Board to issue a temporary license under which a person who has obtained the required
12 education but has not yet passed the required examination or obtained the required
13 certification may engage in the supervised practice of genetic counseling. Section 6 of this bill
14 requires the Board to adopt certain other regulations regarding the licensure and practice of
15 genetic counselors. Section 9 of this bill authorizes certain unlicensed persons to provide
16 assistance or consulting services related to genetic counseling, and section 16 of this bill

Senate Amendment No. 35 to Senate Bill No. 189 Page 4
17 exempts a genetic counselor of the Federal Government and permitted practitioners of
18 other healing arts who are authorized to provide genetic counseling from licensure and
19 regulation by the Board. Section 9 also authorizes a physician or a physician assistant to
20 engage in genetic counseling as part of his or her practice without obtaining a license as a
21 genetic counselor. Section 10 of this bill prescribes the date on which a license as a genetic
22 counselor expires and the requirements to renew such a license. Section 23 of this bill
23 prescribes the maximum fees that the Board may charge for the issuance or renewal of a
24 license or a temporary license as a genetic counselor. Section 11 of this bill prescribes the
25 procedure for the voluntary surrender of such a license.
26 Section 12 of this bill prescribes the grounds for disciplinary action against a genetic
27 counselor. Sections 24, 25 and 27 of this bill apply to genetic counselors the existing process
28 for the filing of a complaint with the Board concerning a licensee or notifying the Board of
29 certain actions taken against a licensee. Sections 26, 28-33, 36 and 38 of this bill apply to
30 genetic counselors: (1) existing procedures for the investigation of complaints and the
31 imposition of disciplinary action against licensees; and (2) certain other existing procedures to
32 address incompetence or misconduct by a licensee. Section 34 of this bill applies to genetic
33 counselors the existing procedure to remove limitations that the Board has placed on a license
34 or to restore a revoked license. Sections 36, 37, 39 and 40 of this bill authorize or require the
35 Board to take certain actions against a person who is practicing genetic counseling or holding
36 himself or herself out as a genetic counselor without a license.
37 Sections 13, 15 and 19-21 of this bill make various conforming changes so that genetic
38 counselors are treated similarly to other providers of health care licensed by the Board for
39 certain purposes related to licensure and regulation. Section 17 of this bill deems any act that
40 constitutes the practice of genetic counseling to occur where the patient is located at the time
41 the act is performed. [Section] Section 5.9 of this bill requires the Board to appoint the
42 Genetic Counseling Advisory Council to advise the Board concerning the regulation of
43 genetic counseling until January 1, 2031. After that date, section 18 of this bill authorizes
44 the Board to select genetic counselors to serve as advisory members of the Board. Sections 22
45 and 35 of this bill subject genetic counselors to certain provisions required by federal law for
46 the enforcement of child support obligations. (42 U.S.C. § 666)
47 Existing law defines the term “provider of health care” to mean a person who practices
48 any of certain professions related to the provision of health care. (NRS 629.031) Existing law
49 imposes certain requirements upon providers of health care, including requirements for
50 billing, standards for advertisements and criminal penalties for acquiring certain debts. (NRS
51 629.071, 629.076, 629.078) Section 1 of this bill includes genetic counselors in the definition
52 of “provider of health care,” thereby subjecting genetic counselors to those same
53 requirements. Section 42 of this bill requires a genetic counselor to report misconduct by a
54 person licensed or certified by the State Board of Nursing to the Executive Director of that
55 Board.
56 Existing law establishes a privilege for confidential communications between a patient
57 and a physician, dentist or chiropractor or person participating in the diagnosis or treatment of
58 the patient under the direction of such a provider. (NRS 49.215-49.245) Section 48 of this bill
59 extends that same privilege to apply to confidential communications between a patient and a
60 genetic counselor or a person under the direction of a genetic counselor.
61 Existing law provides that: (1) assault is generally a misdemeanor, with certain
62 exceptions; and (2) assault upon a provider of health care is a gross misdemeanor or felony,
63 depending on the circumstances. (NRS 200.471) Section 51 of this bill includes a genetic
64 counselor within the definition of “provider of health care” for that purpose, thereby making
65 assault upon a genetic counselor a gross misdemeanor or felony, depending on the
66 circumstances. Section 52 of this bill requires a genetic counselor to report the abuse, neglect,
67 exploitation, isolation or abandonment of an older person or vulnerable person or the abuse or
68 neglect of a child in the same manner as other providers of health care. A genetic counselor
69 would also be required to report the abuse, neglect or commercial sexual exploitation of a
70 child. (NRS 432B.220, 432C.110) Sections 41, 43 and 44 of this bill provide that a genetic
71 counselor acting within his or her scope of practice is not violating provisions governing
72 certain other providers of health care. Sections 2, 45-47, 49, 50 and 53-59 of this bill make
73 revisions to treat genetic counselors in the same manner as other similar providers of health
74 care in other certain respects.

36 failure of a physician, physician assistant, genetic counselor, practitioner of

13 judgment creditor be paid in whole or in part by periodic payments rather than by a
14 lump-sum payment if the award equals or exceeds $50,000 in future damages.
15 4. In entering a judgment ordering the payment of future damages by periodic
16 payments pursuant to subsection 3, the court shall make a specific finding as to the
17 dollar amount of periodic payments that will compensate the judgment creditor for
18 such future damages. As a condition to authorizing periodic payments of future
19 damages, the court shall require a judgment debtor who is not adequately insured to
20 post security adequate to assure full payment of such damages awarded by the
21 judgment. Upon termination of periodic payments of future damages, the court
22 shall order the return of this security, or so much as remains, to the judgment
23 debtor.
24 5. A judgment ordering the payment of future damages by periodic payments
25 entered pursuant to subsection 3 must specify the recipient or recipients of the
26 payments, the dollar amount of the payments, the interval between payments, and
27 the number of payments or the period of time over which payments will be made.
28 Such payments must only be subject to modification in the event of the death of the
29 judgment creditor. Money damages awarded for loss of future earnings must not be
30 reduced or payments terminated by reason of the death of the judgment creditor, but
31 must be paid to persons to whom the judgment creditor owed a duty of support, as
32 provided by law, immediately before the judgment creditor’s death. In such cases,
33 the court that rendered the original judgment may, upon petition of any party in
34 interest, modify the judgment to award and apportion the unpaid future damages in
35 accordance with this subsection.
36 6. If the court finds that the judgment debtor has exhibited a continuing
37 pattern of failing to make the periodic payments as specified pursuant to subsection
38 5, the court shall find the judgment debtor in contempt of court and, in addition to
39 the required periodic payments, shall order the judgment debtor to pay the
40 judgment creditor all damages caused by the failure to make such periodic
41 payments, including, but not limited to, court costs and attorney’s fees.
42 7. Following the occurrence or expiration of all obligations specified in the
43 periodic payment judgment, any obligation of the judgment debtor to make further
44 payments ceases and any security given pursuant to subsection 4 reverts to the
45 judgment debtor.
