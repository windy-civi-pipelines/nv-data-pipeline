AN ACT relating to genetic counseling; prescribing certain duties
and authority of a genetic counselor; providing for the
regulation of the practice of genetic counseling by
the Board of Medical Examiners; prescribing the
requirements for the issuance and renewal of a license as
a genetic counselor; authorizing the Board to take certain

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of physicians, physician
2 assistants, anesthesiologist assistants, perfusionists and practitioners of respiratory
3 care by the Board of Medical Examiners. (Chapter 630 of NRS) This bill
4 additionally provides for the licensure and regulation of genetic counselors by the
5 Board. Sections 4 and 5 of this bill define the terms “genetic counseling” and
6 “genetic counselor,” respectively, and section 14 of this bill establishes the
7 applicability of those definitions. Section 40 of this bill makes it a felony for a
8 person to practice genetic counseling or hold himself or herself out as a genetic
9 counselor without a license. Section 7 of this bill prescribes the requirements to
10 obtain such a license, including obtaining certain education, passing certain
11 examinations and obtaining certification from the American Board of Genetic
-

12 Counseling. Section 8 of this bill authorizes the Board to issue a temporary license
13 under which a person who has obtained the required education but has not yet
14 passed the required examination or obtained the required certification may engage
15 in the supervised practice of genetic counseling. Section 6 of this bill requires the
16 Board to adopt certain other regulations regarding the licensure and practice of
17 genetic counselors. Section 9 of this bill authorizes certain unlicensed persons to
18 provide assistance or consulting services related to genetic counseling, and section
19 16 of this bill exempts a genetic counselor of the Federal Government from
20 licensure and regulation by the Board. Section 9 also authorizes a physician or a
21 physician assistant to engage in genetic counseling as part of his or her practice
22 without obtaining a license as a genetic counselor. Section 10 of this bill prescribes
23 the date on which a license as a genetic counselor expires and the requirements to
24 renew such a license. Section 23 of this bill prescribes the maximum fees that the
25 Board may charge for the issuance or renewal of a license or a temporary license as
26 a genetic counselor. Section 11 of this bill prescribes the procedure for the
27 voluntary surrender of such a license.
28 Section 12 of this bill prescribes the grounds for disciplinary action against a
29 genetic counselor. Sections 24, 25 and 27 of this bill apply to genetic counselors
30 the existing process for the filing of a complaint with the Board concerning a
31 licensee or notifying the Board of certain actions taken against a licensee. Sections
32 26, 28-33, 36 and 38 of this bill apply to genetic counselors: (1) existing
33 procedures for the investigation of complaints and the imposition of disciplinary
34 action against licensees; and (2) certain other existing procedures to address
35 incompetence or misconduct by a licensee. Section 34 of this bill applies to genetic
36 counselors the existing procedure to remove limitations that the Board has placed
37 on a license or to restore a revoked license. Sections 36, 37, 39 and 40 of this bill
38 authorize or require the Board to take certain actions against a person who is
39 practicing genetic counseling or holding himself or herself out as a genetic
40 counselor without a license.
41 Sections 13, 15 and 19-21 of this bill make various conforming changes so that
42 genetic counselors are treated similarly to other providers of health care licensed by
43 the Board for certain purposes related to licensure and regulation. Section 17 of this
44 bill deems any act that constitutes the practice of genetic counseling to occur where
45 the patient is located at the time the act is performed. Section 18 of this bill
46 authorizes the Board to select genetic counselors to serve as advisory members of
47 the Board. Sections 22 and 35 of this bill subject genetic counselors to certain
48 provisions required by federal law for the enforcement of child support obligations.
49 (42 U.S.C. § 666)
50 Existing law defines the term “provider of health care” to mean a person who
51 practices any of certain professions related to the provision of health care. (NRS
52 629.031) Existing law imposes certain requirements upon providers of health care,
53 including requirements for billing, standards for advertisements and criminal
54 penalties for acquiring certain debts. (NRS 629.071, 629.076, 629.078) Section 1 of
55 this bill includes genetic counselors in the definition of “provider of health care,”
56 thereby subjecting genetic counselors to those same requirements. Section 42 of
57 this bill requires a genetic counselor to report misconduct by a person licensed or
58 certified by the State Board of Nursing to the Executive Director of that Board.
59 Existing law establishes a privilege for confidential communications between a
60 patient and a physician, dentist or chiropractor or person participating in the
61 diagnosis or treatment of the patient under the direction of such a provider. (NRS
62 49.215-49.245) Section 48 of this bill extends that same privilege to apply to
63 confidential communications between a patient and a genetic counselor or a person
64 under the direction of a genetic counselor.
65 Existing law provides that: (1) assault is generally a misdemeanor, with certain
66 exceptions; and (2) assault upon a provider of health care is a gross misdemeanor or
-
*SB189*
– 3 –
67 felony, depending on the circumstances. (NRS 200.471) Section 51 of this bill
68 includes a genetic counselor within the definition of “provider of health care” for
69 that purpose, thereby making assault upon a genetic counselor a gross misdemeanor
70 or felony, depending on the circumstances. Section 52 of this bill requires a genetic
71 counselor to report the abuse, neglect, exploitation, isolation or abandonment of an
72 older person or vulnerable person or the abuse or neglect of a child in the same
73 manner as other providers of health care. A genetic counselor would also be
74 required to report the abuse, neglect or commercial sexual exploitation of a child.
75 (NRS 432B.220, 432C.110) Sections 41, 43 and 44 of this bill provide that a
76 genetic counselor acting within his or her scope of practice is not violating
77 provisions governing certain other providers of health care. Sections 2, 45-47, 49,
78 50 and 53-59 of this bill make revisions to treat genetic counselors in the same
79 manner as other similar providers of health care in other certain respects.

7 the death of the judgment creditor. Money damages awarded for loss

13 upon petition of any party in interest, modify the judgment to award
14 and apportion the unpaid future damages in accordance with this
15 subsection.
16 6. If the court finds that the judgment debtor has exhibited a
17 continuing pattern of failing to make the periodic payments as
18 specified pursuant to subsection 5, the court shall find the judgment
19 debtor in contempt of court and, in addition to the required periodic
20 payments, shall order the judgment debtor to pay the judgment

~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to genetic counseling; prescribing certain duties
and authority of a genetic counselor; providing for the
regulation of the practice of genetic counseling by
the Board of Medical Examiners; prescribing the
requirements for the issuance and renewal of a license as
a genetic counselor; authorizing the Board to take certain
actions to investigate and impose discipline against a
genetic counselor; prohibiting the unlicensed practice of
genetic counseling except in certain circumstances;
establishing a privilege for certain confidential
communications; providing penalties; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of physicians, physician
2 assistants, anesthesiologist assistants, perfusionists and practitioners of respiratory
3 care by the Board of Medical Examiners. (Chapter 630 of NRS) This bill
4 additionally provides for the licensure and regulation of genetic counselors by the
5 Board. Sections 4 and 5 of this bill define the terms “genetic counseling” and
6 “genetic counselor,” respectively, and section 14 of this bill establishes the
7 applicability of those definitions. Section 40 of this bill makes it a felony for a
8 person to practice genetic counseling or hold himself or herself out as a genetic
9 counselor without a license. Section 7 of this bill prescribes the requirements to
10 obtain such a license, including obtaining certain education, passing certain
11 examinations and obtaining certification from the American Board of Genetic
-
*SB189*

– 2 –
12 Counseling. Section 8 of this bill authorizes the Board to issue a temporary license
13 under which a person who has obtained the required education but has not yet
14 passed the required examination or obtained the required certification may engage
15 in the supervised practice of genetic counseling. Section 6 of this bill requires the
16 Board to adopt certain other regulations regarding the licensure and practice of
17 genetic counselors. Section 9 of this bill authorizes certain unlicensed persons to
18 provide assistance or consulting services related to genetic counseling, and section
19 16 of this bill exempts a genetic counselor of the Federal Government from
20 licensure and regulation by the Board. Section 9 also authorizes a physician or a
21 physician assistant to engage in genetic counseling as part of his or her practice
22 without obtaining a license as a genetic counselor. Section 10 of this bill prescribes
23 the date on which a license as a genetic counselor expires and the requirements to
24 renew such a license. Section 23 of this bill prescribes the maximum fees that the
25 Board may charge for the issuance or renewal of a license or a temporary license as
26 a genetic counselor. Section 11 of this bill prescribes the procedure for the
27 voluntary surrender of such a license.
28 Section 12 of this bill prescribes the grounds for disciplinary action against a
29 genetic counselor. Sections 24, 25 and 27 of this bill apply to genetic counselors
30 the existing process for the filing of a complaint with the Board concerning a
31 licensee or notifying the Board of certain actions taken against a licensee. Sections
32 26, 28-33, 36 and 38 of this bill apply to genetic counselors: (1) existing
33 procedures for the investigation of complaints and the imposition of disciplinary
34 action against licensees; and (2) certain other existing procedures to address
35 incompetence or misconduct by a licensee. Section 34 of this bill applies to genetic
36 counselors the existing procedure to remove limitations that the Board has placed
37 on a license or to restore a revoked license. Sections 36, 37, 39 and 40 of this bill
38 authorize or require the Board to take certain actions against a person who is
39 practicing genetic counseling or holding himself or herself out as a genetic
40 counselor without a license.
41 Sections 13, 15 and 19-21 of this bill make various conforming changes so that
42 genetic counselors are treated similarly to other providers of health care licensed by
43 the Board for certain purposes related to licensure and regulation. Section 17 of this
44 bill deems any act that constitutes the practice of genetic counseling to occur where
45 the patient is located at the time the act is performed. Section 18 of this bill
46 authorizes the Board to select genetic counselors to serve as advisory members of
47 the Board. Sections 22 and 35 of this bill subject genetic counselors to certain
48 provisions required by federal law for the enforcement of child support obligations.
49 (42 U.S.C. § 666)
50 Existing law defines the term “provider of health care” to mean a person who
51 practices any of certain professions related to the provision of health care. (NRS
52 629.031) Existing law imposes certain requirements upon providers of health care,
53 including requirements for billing, standards for advertisements and criminal
54 penalties for acquiring certain debts. (NRS 629.071, 629.076, 629.078) Section 1 of
55 this bill includes genetic counselors in the definition of “provider of health care,”
56 thereby subjecting genetic counselors to those same requirements. Section 42 of
57 this bill requires a genetic counselor to report misconduct by a person licensed or
58 certified by the State Board of Nursing to the Executive Director of that Board.
59 Existing law establishes a privilege for confidential communications between a
60 patient and a physician, dentist or chiropractor or person participating in the
61 diagnosis or treatment of the patient under the direction of such a provider. (NRS
62 49.215-49.245) Section 48 of this bill extends that same privilege to apply to
63 confidential communications between a patient and a genetic counselor or a person
64 under the direction of a genetic counselor.
65 Existing law provides that: (1) assault is generally a misdemeanor, with certain
66 exceptions; and (2) assault upon a provider of health care is a gross misdemeanor or
-
*SB189*

– 3 –
67 felony, depending on the circumstances. (NRS 200.471) Section 51 of this bill
68 includes a genetic counselor within the definition of “provider of health care” for
69 that purpose, thereby making assault upon a genetic counselor a gross misdemeanor
70 or felony, depending on the circumstances. Section 52 of this bill requires a genetic
71 counselor to report the abuse, neglect, exploitation, isolation or abandonment of an
72 older person or vulnerable person or the abuse or neglect of a child in the same
73 manner as other providers of health care. A genetic counselor would also be
74 required to report the abuse, neglect or commercial sexual exploitation of a child.
75 (NRS 432B.220, 432C.110) Sections 41, 43 and 44 of this bill provide that a
76 genetic counselor acting within his or her scope of practice is not violating
77 provisions governing certain other providers of health care. Sections 2, 45-47, 49,
78 50 and 53-59 of this bill make revisions to treat genetic counselors in the same
79 manner as other similar providers of health care in other certain respects.

37 damages by periodic payments pursuant to subsection 3, the court

40 damages. As a condition to authorizing periodic payments of future
41 damages, the court shall require a judgment debtor who is not
42 adequately insured to post security adequate to assure full payment
43 of such damages awarded by the judgment. Upon termination of
44 periodic payments of future damages, the court shall order the return
45 of this security, or so much as remains, to the judgment debtor.

6 Such payments must only be subject to modification in the event of
7 the death of the judgment creditor. Money damages awarded for loss
8 of future earnings must not be reduced or payments terminated by
9 reason of the death of the judgment creditor, but must be paid to

13 upon petition of any party in interest, modify the judgment to award
14 and apportion the unpaid future damages in accordance with this
15 subsection.
16 6. If the court finds that the judgment debtor has exhibited a
17 continuing pattern of failing to make the periodic payments as
18 specified pursuant to subsection 5, the court shall find the judgment
