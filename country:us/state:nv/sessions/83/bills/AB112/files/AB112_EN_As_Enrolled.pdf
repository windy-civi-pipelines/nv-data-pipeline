Assembly Bill No. 112–Assemblymember Nguyen
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to employment; removing an exemption for
employees covered under a valid collective bargaining
agreement from provisions providing certain employees with
the right to use sick leave to assist a member of the
employee’s immediate family with certain medical needs;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law requires a private employer that provides employees with sick
leave to allow an employee to use accrued sick leave for an absence due to an
illness, injury, medical appointment or other authorized medical need of a member
of the employee’s immediate family. Existing law exempts an employer from this
requirement if the employee is covered under a valid collective bargaining
agreement. (NRS 608.01975) Section 1 of this bill eliminates the exemption,
thereby making the requirement applicable to an employer even if the employee is
covered under a valid collective bargaining agreement. Section 1 also provides that
the obligation of an employer to comply with a collective bargaining agreement,
policy of the employer, employment contract or applicable local, state or federal
law that provides the same or a more generous sick leave benefit is not diminished
by the provisions of section 1. Section 2 of this bill provides that the amendatory
provisions of section 1 do not apply during the current term of any collective
bargaining agreement entered into before October 1, 2025, but do apply to any
extension or renewal of such an agreement and to any collective bargaining
agreement entered into on or after October 1, 2025.

her employees, the employer must allow an employee to use any

authorized medical need to the same extent and under the same
conditions that apply to the employee when taking such leave.
2. An employer may limit the amount of sick leave that an
employee may use pursuant to subsection 1 to an amount which is
equal to not less than the amount of sick leave that the employee
accrues during a 6-month period.
