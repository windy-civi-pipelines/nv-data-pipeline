SUMMARY—Removes an exemption from provisions providing
certain employees with the right to use sick leave to
assist family members. (BDR 53-318)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to employment; removing an exemption for
employees covered under a valid collective bargaining
agreement from provisions providing certain employees
with the right to use sick leave to assist a member of the
employee’s immediate family with certain medical needs;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires a private employer that provides employees with sick
2 leave to allow an employee to use accrued sick leave for an absence due to an
3 illness, injury, medical appointment or other authorized medical need of a member
4 of the employee’s immediate family. Existing law exempts an employer from this
5 requirement if the employee is covered under a valid collective bargaining
6 agreement. (NRS 608.01975) Section 1 of this bill eliminates the exemption,
7 thereby making the requirement applicable to an employer even if the employee is
8 covered under a valid collective bargaining agreement. Section 1 also provides that
9 the obligation of an employer to comply with a collective bargaining agreement,
10 policy of the employer, employment contract or applicable local, state or federal
11 law that provides the same or a more generous sick leave benefit is not diminished
12 by the provisions of section 1. Section 2 of this bill provides that the amendatory
13 provisions of section 1 do not apply during the current term of any collective
14 bargaining agreement entered into before October 1, 2025, but do apply to any
15 extension or renewal of such an agreement and to any collective bargaining
16 agreement entered into on or after October 1, 2025.

5 her employees, the employer must allow an employee to use any
6 accrued sick leave to assist a member of the immediate family of the
7 employee who has an illness, injury, medical appointment or other
8 authorized medical need to the same extent and under the same
9 conditions that apply to the employee when taking such leave.
10 2. An employer may limit the amount of sick leave that an
11 employee may use pursuant to subsection 1 to an amount which is
12 equal to not less than the amount of sick leave that the employee
13 accrues during a 6-month period.
14 3. The Labor Commissioner shall prepare a bulletin which
15 clearly sets forth an explanation of the provisions of this section.
16 The Labor Commissioner shall post the bulletin on the Internet
17 website maintained by the Office of Labor Commissioner and shall
18 require each employer that provides sick leave to employees to post
19 the bulletin in a conspicuous location in each workplace maintained
20 by the employer. The bulletin may be included in any printed
21 abstract posted by the employer pursuant to NRS 608.013.

16 or renewal of such an agreement and to any collective bargaining
17 agreement entered into on or after October 1, 2025. For the purposes
18 of this section, the term of an agreement ends on the date provided
19 in the agreement, notwithstanding any provision of the agreement
20 that remains in effect, in whole or in part, after that date until a
21 successor agreement becomes effective.
