Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes a student of social work or a social work trainee to

3 recognized by the Board of Examiners for Social Workers. (NRS 641B.040)
4 Sections 4 and 8 of this bill additionally authorize a student of social work to
5 engage in the supervised practice of social work if he or she: (1) is enrolled in any
6 of certain programs of education in social work; (2) is employed at a practicum site
7 approved by the Board; and (3) meets any other requirements prescribed by
8 regulation of the Board. Section 4 authorizes such a student of social work to

10 site. Section 4 authorizes such a student of social work to practice social work only
11 under the supervision of a social worker, a master social worker, an independent
-

12 social worker, a clinical social worker or another provider of health care approved
13 by the Board. Sections 4 and 5 of this bill require a student of social work
14 employed at a practicum site to comply with laws and regulations governing the
15 practice of social work, and sections 8 and 9 of this bill authorize the Board to
16 impose discipline against such a student who violates such provisions. Section 4
17 imposes various additional requirements concerning: (1) the oversight of such a
18 student by a practicum site; and (2) the practice of social work by such a student.
19 Section 6 of this bill requires the Board to adopt certain regulations governing
20 students of social work employed at practicum sites. Section 7 of this bill makes
21 certain provisions governing recordings of the provision of mental health services
22 by a social worker, master social worker, independent social worker or clinical
23 social worker for training purposes also apply to such recordings of a student of
24 social work employed at a practicum site.
25 Sections 1-3 and 10 of this bill provide that a student of social work employed
26 at a practicum site is not subject to provisions of law governing the practice of
27 certain other health professions. Sections 11-14 and 16 of this bill make applicable
28 to such students certain provisions that currently apply to social workers regarding:
29 (1) privileged communications with clients; (2) enhanced penalties for assault on
30 providers of health care; and (3) reporting of the abuse, neglect, exploitation,
31 isolation or abandonment of older persons and vulnerable persons and the abuse or
32 neglect of children.
33 Section 15 of this bill authorizes the Board of Regents of the Nevada System of
34 Higher Education to establish a program to: (1) reimburse practicum sites for the
35 compensation of students of social work; (2) compensate providers of health care
36 who supervise such students; (3) provide a financial incentive for practicum sites
37 when such a student who engaged in the practice of social work at a practicum site
38 becomes a licensed social worker; and (4) reimburse such a student who works at a
39 remote practicum site for the costs of travel, meals and lodging. Section 17 of this

providing for the establishment of a program to pay
certain costs of the practice of social work by such

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes a student of social work or a social work trainee to
2 engage in the supervised practice of social work in a training institution or facility
3 recognized by the Board of Examiners for Social Workers. (NRS 641B.040)
4 Sections 4 and 8 of this bill additionally authorize a student of social work to
5 engage in the supervised practice of social work if he or she: (1) is enrolled in any
6 of certain programs of education in social work; (2) is employed at a practicum site
7 approved by the Board; and (3) meets any other requirements prescribed by
8 regulation of the Board. Section 4 authorizes such a student of social work to
9 perform only tasks authorized by the Board and approved by his or her practicum
10 site. Section 4 authorizes such a student of social work to practice social work only
11 under the supervision of a social worker, a master social worker, an independent
-

– 2 –
12 social worker, a clinical social worker or another provider of health care approved
13 by the Board. Sections 4 and 5 of this bill require a student of social work
14 employed at a practicum site to comply with laws and regulations governing the
15 practice of social work, and sections 8 and 9 of this bill authorize the Board to
16 impose discipline against such a student who violates such provisions. Section 4
17 imposes various additional requirements concerning: (1) the oversight of such a
18 student by a practicum site; and (2) the practice of social work by such a student.
19 Section 6 of this bill requires the Board to adopt certain regulations governing
20 students of social work employed at practicum sites. Section 7 of this bill makes
21 certain provisions governing recordings of the provision of mental health services
22 by a social worker, master social worker, independent social worker or clinical
23 social worker for training purposes also apply to such recordings of a student of
24 social work employed at a practicum site.
25 Sections 1-3 and 10 of this bill provide that a student of social work employed
26 at a practicum site is not subject to provisions of law governing the practice of
27 certain other health professions. Sections 11-14 and 16 of this bill make applicable
28 to such students certain provisions that currently apply to social workers regarding:
29 (1) privileged communications with clients; (2) enhanced penalties for assault on
30 providers of health care; and (3) reporting of the abuse, neglect, exploitation,
31 isolation or abandonment of older persons and vulnerable persons and the abuse or
32 neglect of children.
33 Section 15 of this bill authorizes the Board of Regents of the Nevada System of
34 Higher Education to establish a program to: (1) reimburse practicum sites for the
35 compensation of students of social work; (2) compensate providers of health care
36 who supervise such students; (3) provide a financial incentive for practicum sites
37 when such a student who engaged in the practice of social work at a practicum site
38 becomes a licensed social worker; and (4) reimburse such a student who works at a
39 remote practicum site for the costs of travel, meals and lodging. Section 17 of this
40 bill makes an appropriation to the System to pay the costs of the program.
