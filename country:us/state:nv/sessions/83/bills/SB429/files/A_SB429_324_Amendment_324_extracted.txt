Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes a student of social work or a social work trainee to engage in the
2 supervised practice of social work in a training institution or facility recognized by the Board
3 of Examiners for Social Workers. (NRS 641B.040) [Sections 4 and 8 of this bill additionally
4 authorize a student of social work to engage in the supervised practice of social work if he or
5 she: (1) is enrolled in any of certain programs of education in social work; (2) is employed at a
6 practicum site approved by the Board; and (3) meets any other requirements prescribed by
7 regulation of the Board. Section 4 authorizes such a student of social work to perform only
8 tasks authorized by the Board and approved by his or her practicum site. Section 4 authorizes
9 such a student of social work to practice social work only under the supervision of a social
10 worker, a master social worker, an independent social worker, a clinical social worker or
11 another provider of health care approved by the Board. Sections 4 and 5 of this bill require a
12 student of social work employed at a practicum site to comply with laws and regulations
Senate Amendment No. 324 to Senate Bill No. 429 Page 4
13 governing the practice of social work, and sections 8 and 9 of this bill authorize the Board to
14 impose discipline against such a student who violates such provisions. Section 4 imposes
15 various additional requirements concerning: (1) the oversight of such a student by a practicum
16 site; and (2) the practice of social work by such a student. Section 6 of this bill requires the
17 Board to adopt certain regulations governing students of social work employed at practicum
18 sites. Section 7 of this bill makes certain provisions governing recordings of the provision of
19 mental health services by a social worker, master social worker, independent social worker or
20 clinical social worker for training purposes also apply to such recordings of a student of social
21 work employed at a practicum site.
22 Sections 1-3 and 10 of this bill provide that a student of social work employed at a
23 practicum site is not subject to provisions of law governing the practice of certain other health
24 professions. Sections 11-14 and 16 of this bill make applicable to such students certain
25 provisions that currently apply to social workers regarding: (1) privileged communications
26 with clients; (2) enhanced penalties for assault on providers of health care; and (3) reporting
27 of the abuse, neglect, exploitation, isolation or abandonment of older persons and vulnerable
28 persons and the abuse or neglect of children.
29 Section 15 of this bill authorizes the Board of Regents of the Nevada System of Higher
30 Education to establish a program to: (1) reimburse practicum sites for the compensation of
31 students of social work; (2) compensate providers of health care who supervise such students;
32 (3) provide a financial incentive for practicum sites when such a student who engaged in the
33 practice of social work at a practicum site becomes a licensed social worker; and (4)
34 reimburse such a student who works at a remote practicum site for the costs of travel, meals
35 and lodging.] Section 17 of this bill makes [an appropriation to the System to pay the costs of
36 the program.] appropriations to the University of Nevada, Reno, and the University of
37 Nevada, Las Vegas, to award scholarships to students who: (1) are enrolled in a program
38 to obtain a bachelor’s degree or master’s degree in social work; and (2) as part of such a
39 program, are engaging in a field practicum at a practicum site that meets certain
40 requirements.

AN ACT relating to social work; [authorizing a student of social work to engage in
the supervised practice of social work at a practicum site under certain
conditions; authorizing the imposition of discipline against such a
student; providing for the establishment of a program to pay certain
costs of the practice of social work by such students at practicum
sites;] making [an appropriation to cover the costs of that program;
providing a penalty;] appropriations to the University of Nevada,
Reno, and the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, to award
scholarships to certain students enrolled in social work programs;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes a student of social work or a social work trainee to engage in the
2 supervised practice of social work in a training institution or facility recognized by the Board
3 of Examiners for Social Workers. (NRS 641B.040) [Sections 4 and 8 of this bill additionally
4 authorize a student of social work to engage in the supervised practice of social work if he or
5 she: (1) is enrolled in any of certain programs of education in social work; (2) is employed at a
6 practicum site approved by the Board; and (3) meets any other requirements prescribed by
7 regulation of the Board. Section 4 authorizes such a student of social work to perform only
8 tasks authorized by the Board and approved by his or her practicum site. Section 4 authorizes
9 such a student of social work to practice social work only under the supervision of a social
10 worker, a master social worker, an independent social worker, a clinical social worker or
11 another provider of health care approved by the Board. Sections 4 and 5 of this bill require a
12 student of social work employed at a practicum site to comply with laws and regulations

Senate Amendment No. 324 to Senate Bill No. 429 Page 4
13 governing the practice of social work, and sections 8 and 9 of this bill authorize the Board to
14 impose discipline against such a student who violates such provisions. Section 4 imposes
15 various additional requirements concerning: (1) the oversight of such a student by a practicum
16 site; and (2) the practice of social work by such a student. Section 6 of this bill requires the
17 Board to adopt certain regulations governing students of social work employed at practicum
18 sites. Section 7 of this bill makes certain provisions governing recordings of the provision of
19 mental health services by a social worker, master social worker, independent social worker or
20 clinical social worker for training purposes also apply to such recordings of a student of social
21 work employed at a practicum site.
22 Sections 1-3 and 10 of this bill provide that a student of social work employed at a
23 practicum site is not subject to provisions of law governing the practice of certain other health
24 professions. Sections 11-14 and 16 of this bill make applicable to such students certain
25 provisions that currently apply to social workers regarding: (1) privileged communications
26 with clients; (2) enhanced penalties for assault on providers of health care; and (3) reporting
27 of the abuse, neglect, exploitation, isolation or abandonment of older persons and vulnerable
28 persons and the abuse or neglect of children.
29 Section 15 of this bill authorizes the Board of Regents of the Nevada System of Higher
30 Education to establish a program to: (1) reimburse practicum sites for the compensation of
31 students of social work; (2) compensate providers of health care who supervise such students;
32 (3) provide a financial incentive for practicum sites when such a student who engaged in the
33 practice of social work at a practicum site becomes a licensed social worker; and (4)
34 reimburse such a student who works at a remote practicum site for the costs of travel, meals
35 and lodging.] Section 17 of this bill makes [an appropriation to the System to pay the costs of
36 the program.] appropriations to the University of Nevada, Reno, and the University of
37 Nevada, Las Vegas, to award scholarships to students who: (1) are enrolled in a program
38 to obtain a bachelor’s degree or master’s degree in social work; and (2) as part of such a
39 program, are engaging in a field practicum at a practicum site that meets certain
40 requirements.
