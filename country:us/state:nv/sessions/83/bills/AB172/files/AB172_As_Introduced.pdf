EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to criminal procedure; expanding the applicability
of certain provisions governing the disclosure by a
provider of Internet service of certain records stored on
the Internet; providing a penalty; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing federal law: (1) regulates the ability of federal, state and local
2 governmental entities to access certain records stored on the Internet; and (2) sets
3 forth certain requirements governing the disclosure of such information. (18 U.S.C.
4 § 2701-2713) In general, existing federal law authorizes a governmental entity to
5 require an Internet service provider that provides a remote computing service to
6 disclose the contents of a wire or electronic communication that has been in
7 electronic storage pursuant to a court order, subpoena or warrant. (18 U.S.C. §
8 2703)
9 Under existing state law, a provider of Internet service who violates federal law
10 is guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than $500. Existing
11 state law also: (1) authorizes certain governmental entities to compel a provider of
12 Internet service to disclose certain information pertaining to a user or subscriber
13 pursuant to a subpoena; and (2) requires a provider of Internet service to keep
14 certain information confidential. (NRS 179.467, 193.340) For the purpose of these
15 provisions, existing state law defines the term “provider of Internet service” to
16 mean any provider who provides subscribers with access to the Internet or an
17 electronic email address, or both. (NRS 205.4758) Section 5 of this bill expands
18 this definition to include a provider of Internet service who provides subscribers or
19 customers with a remote computing service. Section 5 thereby: (1) provides that a
20 provider of Internet service who provides a remote computing service is guilty of a
21 misdemeanor under certain circumstances; (2) authorizes certain governmental
22 entities to compel any such provider to disclose certain information pursuant to a
23 subpoena; and (3) requires any such provider to keep certain information
24 confidential.

29 communications. Section 3 of this bill defines the term “remote computing service”
