AN ACT relating to taxation; providing for the imposition,
collection, administration and enforcement of taxes on the
sale or transfer of a controlling interest in an entity which
possesses an interest in real property in this State;
providing penalties; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law imposes several taxes, known as real property transfer taxes, on
2 each deed by which lands, tenements or other realty are assigned, transferred or
3 otherwise conveyed to, or vested in, another person, or land sale installment
4 contract, if the consideration or value of the interest or property conveyed exceeds
5 $100. The amount of the real property transfer taxes owed is required to be
6 computed on the basis of the value of the transferred real property. (NRS 375.020,
7 375.023, 375.026) Existing law provides for the disposition and use of the proceeds
8 of the real property transfer taxes for specific purposes, including: (1) deposit in the
9 State General Fund; (2) deposit in the Account for Affordable Housing; (3) deposit
10 in the Local Government Tax Distribution Account for credit to the accounts of
11 each county; (4) deposit in the county school district’s fund for capital projects,
12 with respect to proceeds collected in a county whose population is 700,000 or
13 more; and (5) transmittal to the State Treasurer for use by the Division of Plant
14 Health and Compliance of the State Department of Agriculture. (NRS 375.023,
15 375.026, 375.070)
16 Section 8 of this bill imposes taxes on the sale or transfer of a controlling
17 interest in an entity which possesses, directly or indirectly, an interest in real
18 property in this State when the value of the real property interest exceeds $100.
19 Section 8 imposes the taxes at the same rate as the existing real property transfer
20 taxes and requires the taxes to be computed based on the value of the entity’s
-
*AB362_R1*

– 2 –
21 interest in the real property, which corresponds to the estimated fair market value of
22 the real property. Section 9 of this bill requires the person who receives a
23 controlling interest in an entity which is subject to the tax to file a return and remit
24 the tax to the county recorder of each county in which the entity has a controlling
25 interest in real property on or before the last day of the month immediately
26 following the month in which the sale or transfer was made. Section 11 of this bill
27 requires the county recorder to dispose of the proceeds of the tax in the same
28 manner as the corresponding real property transfer taxes. Sections 11 and 25.5
29 authorize the county recorder to deduct and withhold from the tax required to be
30 transmitted to the State Controller for deposit in the State General Fund: (1) for the
31 first 5 years after the effective date of this bill, 2 percent of those taxes to reimburse
32 the county for the cost of collecting the tax; and (2) for each year thereafter, 1
33 percent of those taxes. Section 12 of this bill exempts certain transfers of the
34 controlling interest in an entity from the taxes imposed by section 8. Section 23 of
35 this bill makes it a misdemeanor to willfully falsely declare the estimated fair
36 market value of real property on a return filed pursuant to section 9 and requires the
37 payment of any additional tax required plus a penalty of 25 percent of that amount.
38 Sections 2.5, 3 and 4 of this bill define the terms “controlling interest,”
39 “estimated fair market value” and “taxpayer,” respectively, for the purposes of the
40 provisions governing the taxes imposed by section 8.
41 Section 25 of this bill requires money from the taxes imposed by section 8
42 which is received by the Division of Plant Health and Compliance to be allocated
43 for disbursement to each county in proportion to the money collected with respect
44 to real property in that county: (1) for use by the State Department of Agriculture
45 for programs on the exclusion, detection and control of invasive species and
46 endemic pests and weeds; and (2) to make grants to local governments and
47 nonprofit organizations for the control or management of such species, pests
48 and weeds.
49 Sections 5-5.7, 10.5, and 24.1-24.18 of this bill provide for the administration
50 and enforcement of the taxes imposed by section 8 in, to the extent applicable, the
51 same manner as the real property transfer taxes.

17 Sec. 24.17. 1. Any person who is aggrieved by a decision of
18 the county recorder made pursuant to this chapter may appeal the
19 decision by filing a notice of appeal with the county recorder
20 within 30 days after service of the decision upon that person.
21 2. A hearing officer, appointed by the county, may review any
22 decision made by the county recorder and may reverse, affirm or
23 modify any decision of the county recorder. A hearing officer
24 appointed pursuant to this section must not be an employee of the
25 county recorder’s office. A decision of a hearing officer is a final
26 decision for purposes of judicial review.
27 3. Service of a decision made by the county recorder or a
28 hearing officer pursuant to this chapter must be made personally
29 or by certified mail. If service is made by certified mail:
30 (a) The decision must be enclosed in an envelope that is
31 addressed to the taxpayer at his or her address as it appears on the
32 declaration of value or in the records of the county.
33 (b) It is deemed to be complete at the time the appropriately
34 addressed envelope containing the decision is deposited with the
35 United States Postal Service.
36 4. All decisions of the county recorder made pursuant to this
37 chapter are final unless appealed.
38 5. A county recorder or local government that is a party and
39 is aggrieved by the decision of the hearing officer may seek
40 judicial review of the decision in the district court of that county.
41 Sec. 24.18. 1. The county recorder may waive any tax,
42 penalty and interest owed by the taxpayer pursuant to this chapter,
43 other than the tax imposed by subsection 2 of section 8, if the
44 taxpayer meets the criteria adopted by regulation. If a waiver is

– 12 –
1 granted pursuant to this subsection, the county shall prepare and
2 maintain on file a statement that contains:
3 (a) The reason for the waiver;
4 (b) The amount of the tax, penalty and interest owed by the
5 taxpayer; and
6 (c) The amount of the tax, penalty and interest waived by the
7 county.
8 2. If the county recorder or a designated hearing officer finds
9 that the failure of a person to make a timely payment of any tax
10 imposed is the result of circumstances beyond his or her control
11 and occurred despite the exercise of ordinary care and without
12 intent to avoid such payment, the county recorder may relieve the
13 person of all or part of any interest or penalty or both.
14 3. If a person proves to the satisfaction of the county recorder
15 that the person has in good faith remitted the tax in reliance upon
16 written advice provided by an officer or employee of the county
17 recorder, an opinion of the district attorney or Attorney General or
18 the written results of an audit of the taxpayer’s records conducted
19 by the county recorder, the county recorder may not require the
20 taxpayer to pay delinquent taxes, penalties or interest if the county
21 recorder determines after the completion of a subsequent audit
22 that the taxes the taxpayer remitted were deficient.
