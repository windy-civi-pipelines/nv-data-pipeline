EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to taxation; providing for the imposition, collection,
administration and enforcement of taxes on the sale or transfer of a
controlling interest in an entity which possesses an interest in real
property in this State; providing penalties; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law imposes several taxes, known as real property transfer taxes, on each deed
2 by which lands, tenements or other realty are assigned, transferred or otherwise conveyed to,
3 or vested in, another person, or land sale installment contract, if the consideration or value of
4 the interest or property conveyed exceeds $100. The amount of the real property transfer taxes
5 owed is required to be computed on the basis of the value of the transferred real property.
6 (NRS 375.020, 375.023, 375.026) Existing law provides for the disposition and use of the
7 proceeds of the real property transfer taxes for specific purposes, including: (1) deposit in the
8 State General Fund; (2) deposit in the Account for Affordable Housing; (3) deposit in the
9 Local Government Tax Distribution Account for credit to the accounts of each county; (4)
10 deposit in the county school district’s fund for capital projects, with respect to proceeds
11 collected in a county whose population is 700,000 or more; and (5) transmittal to the State
12 Treasurer for use by the Division of Plant Health and Compliance of the State Department of
13 Agriculture. (NRS 375.023, 375.026, 375.070)
14 Section 8 of this bill imposes taxes on the sale or transfer of a controlling interest in an
15 entity which possesses, directly or indirectly, an interest in real property in this State when the
16 value of the real property interest exceeds $100. Section 8 imposes the taxes at the same rate
17 as the existing real property transfer taxes and requires the taxes to be computed based on the
18 value of the entity’s interest in the real property, which corresponds to the estimated fair
19 market value of the real property. Section 9 of this bill requires the person who [conveys]
20 receives a controlling interest in an entity which is subject to the tax to file a return and remit
21 the tax to the [Department of Taxation] county recorder of each county in which the entity
22 has a controlling interest in real property on or before the last day of the month
23 immediately following the month in which the sale or transfer was made. [Section 10 of this
24 bill authorizes the Department to extend the time within which the tax is required to be paid,
25 upon application and for good cause shown.] Section 11 of this bill requires the [Department]
26 county recorder to [deposit] dispose of the [taxes, interest and penalties collected in the
27 Controlling Interest Transfer Tax Account and requires the State Controller to dispose of
Assembly Amendment No. 374 to Assembly Bill No. 362 Page 4
28 those taxes, interest and penalties] proceeds of the tax in the same manner as the
29 corresponding real property transfer taxes. Sections 11 and 25.5 authorize the county
30 recorder to deduct and withhold from the tax required to be transmitted to the State
31 Controller for deposit in the State General Fund: (1) for the first 5 years after the
32 effective date of this bill, 2 percent of those taxes to reimburse the county for the cost of
33 collecting the tax; and (2) for each year thereafter, 1 percent of those taxes. Section 12 of
34 this bill exempts certain transfers of the controlling interest in an entity from the taxes
35 imposed by section 8. Section 23 of this bill makes it a misdemeanor to willfully falsely
36 declare the estimated fair market value of real property on a return filed pursuant to section 9
37 [.] and requires the payment of any additional tax required plus a penalty of 25 percent
38 of that amount.
39 Sections 2.5, 3 and 4 of this bill define the terms “controlling interest,” “estimated fair
40 market value” and “taxpayer,” respectively, for the purposes of the provisions governing the
41 taxes imposed by section 8.
42 Section 25 of this bill requires money from the taxes imposed by section 8 which is
43 received by the Division of Plant Health and Compliance to be allocated for disbursement to
44 each county in proportion to the money collected with respect to real property in that county:
45 (1) for use by the State Department of Agriculture for programs on the exclusion, detection
46 and control of invasive species and endemic pests and weeds; and (2) to make grants to local
47 governments and nonprofit organizations for the control or management of such species, pests
48 and weeds.
49 Sections [5-7, 13-22 and 24] 5-5.7, 10.5, and 24.1-24.18 of this bill provide for the
50 administration and enforcement of the taxes imposed by section 8 [.] in, to the extent
51 applicable, the same manner as the real property transfer taxes.

1 (d) The estate and effects of an absconding, concealed or absent person
2 required to pay any amount by force of such revenue act are levied upon by
3 process of law.
4 2. This section does not give the county recorder a preference over:

8 illness, family allowances or debts preferred pursuant to federal law or wages as
9 provided in NRS 147.195.

11 has been released from a lien imposed pursuant to this chapter is conclusive
12 evidence that the property has been released.

14 a taxpayer is entitled to an exemption or has been taxed more than is required by
15 law, he or she shall give written notice of that determination to the taxpayer. The
16 notice must:
17 1. Be given within 30 days after the officer or employee makes his or her

19 days after the completion of the audit; and
20 2. If appropriate, include instructions indicating the manner in which the
21 taxpayer may petition for a refund of any overpayment.
22 Sec. 24.14. A taxpayer is entitled to receive on any overpayment of any tax
23 imposed by this chapter a refund together with interest at a rate determined

25 interest on the tax that is paid by a taxpayer.
26 Sec. 24.15. The county recorder shall provide a taxpayer with a response to

30 or his or her designee shall approve or disapprove the refund. If the county
31 recorder approves the refund, he or she shall grant the refund to the taxpayer.
32 2. If the county recorder denies a refund, the petitioner may file a written
33 notice of appeal to the county recorder within 45 days after the date the county
34 recorder decides to deny the petition. If notice is not received by the county
35 recorder within 45 days after his or her decision to deny the petition, the decision
36 of the county recorder is final.
37 3. If the county recorder receives a timely notice of appeal pursuant to
38 subsection 2, he or she shall set a date for a hearing before a hearing officer and
39 notify the parties of the date, place and time of the hearing.
40 Sec. 24.17. 1. Any person who is aggrieved by a decision of the county
41 recorder made pursuant to this chapter may appeal the decision by filing a notice
42 of appeal with the county recorder within 30 days after service of the decision
43 upon that person.
44 2. A hearing officer, appointed by the county, may review any decision
45 made by the county recorder and may reverse, affirm or modify any decision of
46 the county recorder. A hearing officer appointed pursuant to this section must
47 not be an employee of the county recorder’s office. A decision of a hearing
48 officer is a final decision for purposes of judicial review.
49 3. Service of a decision made by the county recorder or a hearing officer
50 pursuant to this chapter must be made personally or by certified mail. If service is
51 made by certified mail:
Assembly Amendment No. 374 to Assembly Bill No. 362 Page 14
1 (a) The decision must be enclosed in an envelope that is addressed to the
2 taxpayer at his or her address as it appears on the declaration of value or in the
3 records of the county.
4 (b) It is deemed to be complete at the time the appropriately addressed
5 envelope containing the decision is deposited with the United States Postal
6 Service.
7 4. All decisions of the county recorder made pursuant to this chapter are
8 final unless appealed.

10 the decision of the hearing officer may seek judicial review of the decision in the
11 district court of that county.
12 Sec. 24.18. 1. The county recorder may waive any tax, penalty and
13 interest owed by the taxpayer pursuant to this chapter, other than the tax imposed
14 by subsection 2 of section 8, if the taxpayer meets the criteria adopted by
15 regulation. If a waiver is granted pursuant to this subsection, the county shall
16 prepare and maintain on file a statement that contains:
17 (a) The reason for the waiver;
18 (b) The amount of the tax, penalty and interest owed by the taxpayer; and
19 (c) The amount of the tax, penalty and interest waived by the county.
20 2. If the county recorder or a designated hearing officer finds that the
21 failure of a person to make a timely payment of any tax imposed is the result of
22 circumstances beyond his or her control and occurred despite the exercise of
23 ordinary care and without intent to avoid such payment, the county recorder may
24 relieve the person of all or part of any interest or penalty or both.
25 3. If a person proves to the satisfaction of the county recorder that the
26 person has in good faith remitted the tax in reliance upon written advice provided
27 by an officer or employee of the county recorder, an opinion of the district
28 attorney or Attorney General or the written results of an audit of the taxpayer’s
29 records conducted by the county recorder, the county recorder may not require
30 the taxpayer to pay delinquent taxes, penalties or interest if the county recorder
31 determines after the completion of a subsequent audit that the taxes the taxpayer
32 remitted were deficient.

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to taxation; providing for the imposition, collection,
administration and enforcement of taxes on the sale or transfer of a
controlling interest in an entity which possesses an interest in real
property in this State; providing penalties; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law imposes several taxes, known as real property transfer taxes, on each deed
2 by which lands, tenements or other realty are assigned, transferred or otherwise conveyed to,
3 or vested in, another person, or land sale installment contract, if the consideration or value of
4 the interest or property conveyed exceeds $100. The amount of the real property transfer taxes
5 owed is required to be computed on the basis of the value of the transferred real property.
6 (NRS 375.020, 375.023, 375.026) Existing law provides for the disposition and use of the
7 proceeds of the real property transfer taxes for specific purposes, including: (1) deposit in the
8 State General Fund; (2) deposit in the Account for Affordable Housing; (3) deposit in the
9 Local Government Tax Distribution Account for credit to the accounts of each county; (4)
10 deposit in the county school district’s fund for capital projects, with respect to proceeds
11 collected in a county whose population is 700,000 or more; and (5) transmittal to the State
12 Treasurer for use by the Division of Plant Health and Compliance of the State Department of
13 Agriculture. (NRS 375.023, 375.026, 375.070)
14 Section 8 of this bill imposes taxes on the sale or transfer of a controlling interest in an
15 entity which possesses, directly or indirectly, an interest in real property in this State when the
16 value of the real property interest exceeds $100. Section 8 imposes the taxes at the same rate
17 as the existing real property transfer taxes and requires the taxes to be computed based on the
18 value of the entity’s interest in the real property, which corresponds to the estimated fair
19 market value of the real property. Section 9 of this bill requires the person who [conveys]
20 receives a controlling interest in an entity which is subject to the tax to file a return and remit
21 the tax to the [Department of Taxation] county recorder of each county in which the entity
22 has a controlling interest in real property on or before the last day of the month
23 immediately following the month in which the sale or transfer was made. [Section 10 of this
24 bill authorizes the Department to extend the time within which the tax is required to be paid,
25 upon application and for good cause shown.] Section 11 of this bill requires the [Department]
26 county recorder to [deposit] dispose of the [taxes, interest and penalties collected in the
27 Controlling Interest Transfer Tax Account and requires the State Controller to dispose of

Assembly Amendment No. 374 to Assembly Bill No. 362 Page 4
28 those taxes, interest and penalties] proceeds of the tax in the same manner as the
29 corresponding real property transfer taxes. Sections 11 and 25.5 authorize the county
30 recorder to deduct and withhold from the tax required to be transmitted to the State
31 Controller for deposit in the State General Fund: (1) for the first 5 years after the
32 effective date of this bill, 2 percent of those taxes to reimburse the county for the cost of
33 collecting the tax; and (2) for each year thereafter, 1 percent of those taxes. Section 12 of
34 this bill exempts certain transfers of the controlling interest in an entity from the taxes
35 imposed by section 8. Section 23 of this bill makes it a misdemeanor to willfully falsely
36 declare the estimated fair market value of real property on a return filed pursuant to section 9
37 [.] and requires the payment of any additional tax required plus a penalty of 25 percent
38 of that amount.
39 Sections 2.5, 3 and 4 of this bill define the terms “controlling interest,” “estimated fair
40 market value” and “taxpayer,” respectively, for the purposes of the provisions governing the
41 taxes imposed by section 8.
42 Section 25 of this bill requires money from the taxes imposed by section 8 which is
43 received by the Division of Plant Health and Compliance to be allocated for disbursement to
44 each county in proportion to the money collected with respect to real property in that county:
45 (1) for use by the State Department of Agriculture for programs on the exclusion, detection
46 and control of invasive species and endemic pests and weeds; and (2) to make grants to local
47 governments and nonprofit organizations for the control or management of such species, pests
48 and weeds.
49 Sections [5-7, 13-22 and 24] 5-5.7, 10.5, and 24.1-24.18 of this bill provide for the
50 administration and enforcement of the taxes imposed by section 8 [.] in, to the extent
51 applicable, the same manner as the real property transfer taxes.

30 pursuant to paragraph (d) of subsection 1, the county recorder of each county
31 may deduct and withhold 2 percent of those taxes to reimburse the county for the
32 cost of collecting the tax.
33 3. In addition to any other authorized use of the proceeds it receives
34 pursuant to subsection 1, a county or city may use the proceeds to pay expenses
35 related to or incurred for the development of tier one affordable housing and tier
36 two affordable housing. A county or city that uses the proceeds in that manner
37 must give priority to the development of tier one affordable housing and tier two

9 5. To a corporation or other business organization if the person making the
10 transfer owns 100 percent of the corporation or organization to which the
11 transfer is made.
12 Sec. 13. [If the Department determines that any tax, penalty or interest has
13 been paid more than once or has been erroneously or illegally collected or
14 computed, the Department shall set forth that fact in the records of the
15 Department and certify to the State Board of Examiners the amount collected in
16 excess of the amount legally due and the person from whom it was collected or by
17 whom it was paid. If approved by the State Board of Examiners, the excess
18 amount collected or paid must, after being credited against any amount then due
19 from the person in accordance with NRS 360.236, be refunded to the person or
20 his or her successors in interest.] (Deleted by amendment.)

28 2. Each claim must be in writing and must state the specific grounds upon
29 which the claim is founded.
30 3. Failure to file a claim within the time prescribed in this chapter
31 constitutes a waiver of any demand against the State on account of overpayment.
32 4. Within 30 days after rejecting any claim in whole or in part, the
33 Department shall serve notice of its action on the claimant in the manner
34 prescribed for service of notice of a deficiency determination.] (Deleted by

1 (d) The estate and effects of an absconding, concealed or absent person
2 required to pay any amount by force of such revenue act are levied upon by

12 Sec. 24.18. 1. The county recorder may waive any tax, penalty and
13 interest owed by the taxpayer pursuant to this chapter, other than the tax imposed
14 by subsection 2 of section 8, if the taxpayer meets the criteria adopted by

16 prepare and maintain on file a statement that contains:
17 (a) The reason for the waiver;
18 (b) The amount of the tax, penalty and interest owed by the taxpayer; and
19 (c) The amount of the tax, penalty and interest waived by the county.
20 2. If the county recorder or a designated hearing officer finds that the
21 failure of a person to make a timely payment of any tax imposed is the result of
22 circumstances beyond his or her control and occurred despite the exercise of
23 ordinary care and without intent to avoid such payment, the county recorder may
24 relieve the person of all or part of any interest or penalty or both.
25 3. If a person proves to the satisfaction of the county recorder that the
26 person has in good faith remitted the tax in reliance upon written advice provided
27 by an officer or employee of the county recorder, an opinion of the district
28 attorney or Attorney General or the written results of an audit of the taxpayer’s
29 records conducted by the county recorder, the county recorder may not require
30 the taxpayer to pay delinquent taxes, penalties or interest if the county recorder
31 determines after the completion of a subsequent audit that the taxes the taxpayer
32 remitted were deficient.
