AN ACT relating to taxation; providing for the imposition,
collection, administration and enforcement of taxes on the
sale or transfer of a controlling interest in an entity which
possesses an interest in real property in this State;

relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law imposes several taxes, known as real property transfer taxes, on
2 each deed by which lands, tenements or other realty are assigned, transferred or
3 otherwise conveyed to, or vested in, another person, or land sale installment
4 contract, if the consideration or value of the interest or property conveyed exceeds
5 $100. The amount of the real property transfer taxes owed is required to be
6 computed on the basis of the value of the transferred real property. (NRS 375.020,
7 375.023, 375.026) Existing law provides for the disposition and use of the proceeds
8 of the real property transfer taxes for specific purposes, including: (1) deposit in the
9 State General Fund; (2) deposit in the Account for Affordable Housing; (3) deposit
10 in the Local Government Tax Distribution Account for credit to the accounts of
11 each county; (4) deposit in the county school district’s fund for capital projects,
12 with respect to proceeds collected in a county whose population is 700,000 or
13 more; and (5) transmittal to the State Treasurer for use by the Division of Plant
14 Health and Compliance of the State Department of Agriculture. (NRS 375.023,
15 375.026, 375.070)
16 Section 8 of this bill imposes taxes on the sale or transfer of a controlling
17 interest in an entity which possesses, directly or indirectly, an interest in real
18 property in this State when the value of the real property interest exceeds $100.
19 Section 8 imposes the taxes at the same rate as the existing real property transfer
20 taxes and requires the taxes to be computed based on the value of the entity’s
21 interest in the real property, which corresponds to the estimated fair market value of
22 the real property. Section 9 of this bill requires the person who conveys a
-
*AB362*

– 2 –
23 controlling interest in an entity which is subject to the tax to file a return and remit
24 the tax to the Department of Taxation on or before the last day of the month
25 immediately following the month in which the sale or transfer was made. Section
26 10 of this bill authorizes the Department to extend the time within which the tax is
27 required to be paid, upon application and for good cause shown. Section 11 of this
28 bill requires the Department to deposit the taxes, interest and penalties collected in
29 the Controlling Interest Transfer Tax Account and requires the State Controller to
30 dispose of those taxes, interest and penalties in the same manner as the
31 corresponding real property transfer taxes. Section 12 of this bill exempts certain
32 transfers of the controlling interest in an entity from the taxes imposed by section 8.
33 Section 23 of this bill makes it a misdemeanor to willfully falsely declare the
34 estimated fair market value of real property on a return filed pursuant to section 9.
35 Sections 3 and 4 of this bill define the terms “estimated fair market value” and
36 “taxpayer,” respectively, for the purposes of the provisions governing the taxes
37 imposed by section 8.
38 Section 25 of this bill requires money from the taxes imposed by section 8
39 which is received by the Division of Plant Health and Compliance to be allocated
40 for disbursement to each county in proportion to the money collected with respect
41 to real property in that county: (1) for use by the State Department of Agriculture
42 for programs on the exclusion, detection and control of invasive species and
43 endemic pests and weeds; and (2) to make grants to local governments and
44 nonprofit organizations for the control or management of such species, pests
45 and weeds.
46 Sections 5-7, 13-22 and 24 of this bill provide for the administration and
47 enforcement of the taxes imposed by section 8.

16 the amount would have been due without the extension until the

21 conducted by the Department, for the recovery of the whole or any
22 part of the amount with respect to which the claim has been
23 disallowed.
24 2. Failure to bring an action within the time specified
25 constitutes a waiver of any demand against the State on account of
26 alleged overpayments.
27 Sec. 18. 1. If the Department fails to mail notice of action
28 on a claim within 6 months after the claim is filed, the claimant
29 may consider the claim disallowed and file an appeal with the

2 days. The date must be determined by the Department.
3 Sec. 20. A judgment may not be rendered in favor of the

6 an assignee of the person paying the amount or by any person
7 other than the person who paid the amount.
8 Sec. 21. 1. The Department may recover a refund or any
9 part thereof which is erroneously made and any credit or part
10 thereof which is erroneously allowed in an action brought in a
11 court of competent jurisdiction in Carson City or Clark County in
12 the name of the State of Nevada.
13 2. The action must be tried in Carson City or Clark County

16 3. The Attorney General shall prosecute the action, and the
17 provisions of the Nevada Revised Statutes, the Nevada Rules of

24 Board of Examiners, and the latter shall authorize the
25 cancellation of the amount upon the records of the Department.
26 2. If an amount not exceeding $25 has been illegally
27 determined, either by the Department or by the person filing the
28 return, the Department, without certifying that fact to the State
29 Board of Examiners, shall authorize the cancellation of the
30 amount upon the records of the Department.
31 Sec. 23. Any person who willfully falsely declares the
32 estimated fair market value of real property on a return filed
33 pursuant to section 9 of this act is guilty of a misdemeanor and
34 shall pay the amount of any additional tax required on account of
35 the falsification.
36 Sec. 24. The remedies of the State provided for in this
37 chapter are cumulative, and no action taken by the Department or
38 the Attorney General constitutes an election by the State to pursue
39 any remedy to the exclusion of any other remedy for which
40 provision is made in this chapter.
