AN ACT relating to criminal procedure; revising provisions
governing bail; revising provisions relating to an order
imposing a condition of release prohibiting contact; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires a person arrested for an offense other than murder of the
2 first degree to be admitted to bail, unless an exception applies. Under existing law,
3 one such exception generally prohibits a court from admitting to bail a person who
4 is arrested for a felony and, at the time of the arrest, the person was under a
5 suspended sentence for a different offense or was serving a term of residential
6 confinement for a different offense. (NRS 178.484) Section 1 of this bill expands
7 this exception to include a person who is arrested for a battery that constitutes
8 domestic violence. Section 1 thereby generally prohibits a court from admitting to
9 bail a person who is arrested for a battery that constitutes domestic violence if, at
10 the time of the arrest, the person was under a suspended sentence for a different
11 offense or was serving a term of residential confinement for a different offense.
12 Existing law similarly: (1) authorizes a court to revoke the bail of a defendant
13 upon a showing that the defendant committed a felony during the period of release;
14 and (2) sets forth certain requirements and procedures for any such revocation of
15 bail. (NRS 178.487) Section 3 of this bill additionally authorizes a court to revoke
16 the bail of a defendant upon a showing that the defendant committed a battery that
17 constitutes domestic violence.
18 Existing law authorizes a court, before convicting and releasing a person, to
19 issue an order imposing a condition of release that prohibits the person from
20 contacting or attempting to contact certain persons. (NRS 178.4845) Section 2 of
21 this bill authorizes a law enforcement officer to arrest and take into custody a
22 person if the officer has probable cause to believe that: (1) an order prohibiting
-

– 2 –
23 contact has been issued against the person; (2) the person has received certain
24 notice concerning the order; and (3) the person is acting in violation of the order.

SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 178.484 is hereby amended to read as follows:

3 person arrested for an offense other than murder of the first degree
4 must be admitted to bail.

18 offense or who has been sentenced to a term of residential

20 must not be admitted to bail unless:
21 (a) A court issues an order directing that the person be admitted
22 to bail; or
23 (b) A department of alternative sentencing directs the detention
24 facility to admit the person to bail.
25 4. A person arrested for murder of the first degree may be
26 admitted to bail unless the proof is evident or the presumption great
27 by any competent court or magistrate authorized by law to do so in
28 the exercise of discretion, giving due weight to the evidence and to
29 the nature and circumstances of the offense.
30 5. A person arrested for a violation of NRS 484C.110,
31 484C.120, 484C.130, 484C.430, 488.410, 488.420 or 488.425 who
