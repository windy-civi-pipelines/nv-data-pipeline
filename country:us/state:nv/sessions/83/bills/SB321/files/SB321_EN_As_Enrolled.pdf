Senate Bill No. 321–Senator Nguyen
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to public utilities; revising provisions relating to
the civil penalty that may be imposed for violating certain
regulations adopted by the Public Utilities Commission of
Nevada; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law provides that a person who violates regulations adopted by the
Public Utilities Commission of Nevada in conformity with the Natural Gas Pipeline
Safety Act of 1968, 49 U.S.C. §§ 60101 et seq., is subject to a civil penalty not to
exceed $200,000 for each violation for each day that the violation persists, up to a
maximum of $2,000,000 for any related series of violations. (NRS 704.595)
Existing federal law and regulations establish corresponding civil penalties relating
to pipeline safety violations, the amounts of which are required to be adjusted each
year to account for inflation and currently may not exceed $272,926 for each
violation for each day the violation persists, up to a maximum of $2,729,245 for
any related series of violations. (49 U.S.C. § 60122(a); 49 C.F.R. § 190.223(a))
This bill revises the amount of the civil penalty to align with the amount that may
be charged for the corresponding civil penalties under federal law.
Existing law also provides that the amount of the civil penalty may be deducted
from any sum owed to the person by the State. (NRS 704.595) This bill removes
these provisions.
