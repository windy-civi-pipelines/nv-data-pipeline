Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires a person who wishes to engage in the business of a
2 document preparation service to register with the Secretary of State. (NRS
3 240A.100) A document preparation service is a person who, for compensation,
4 provides assistance to a client with certain legal matters, including preparing or
5 completing a pleading, application or other document and submitting a completed
6 document on behalf of a client to a court or administration agency.
7 (NRS 240A.030)
8 This bill authorizes a document preparation service to additionally operate as
9 either a Class I or Class II authorized third party. Sections 5-7 of this bill define
10 terms related to authorized third parties, including the terms “Class I authorized
11 third party” and “Class II authorized third party.” Section 10 of this bill authorizes
-
*SB243*
– 2 –
12 a person to engage in the activities of a Class II authorized third party if the person
13 is registered as a document preparation service and holds a local business license.
14 Section 11 of this bill prohibits a person from acting as a Class I authorized third
15 party without a license issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles and provides
16 the requirements to obtain a license, including, without limitation, being registered
17 as a document preparation service, providing fingerprints and passing a criminal
18 background check. Sections 12-14 of this bill establish: (1) additional requirements
19 to obtain or renew a license as a Class I authorized third party; and (2) grounds for
20 the Department to refuse to issue or renew, or to suspend or revoke a license as a
21 Class I authorized third party. Section 15 of this bill provides the circumstances
22 under which an employee of a Class I authorized third party may provide certain
23 services. Section 16 of this bill requires an authorized third party to obtain and
24 compile any records required by the Department.
25 Section 9 of this bill sets forth the services that a Class I and Class II
26 authorized third party may provide, which are: (1) providing applications for
27 certain motor vehicle and off-highway vehicle registration and titling services; (2)
28 accepting those applications; (3) obtaining on behalf of a customer or, in the case of
29 a Class I authorized third party, issuing certificates of registration, certificates of
30 title, certain license plates, decals and certain permits authorizing the travel on the
31 highways of this State of an unregistered vehicle in certain circumstances; (4)
32 notarizing certain documents; (5) submitting change of address information; (6)
33 accepting license plates that are required to be surrendered to the Department; and
34 (7) submitting information to the Department on behalf of customers claiming
35 certain exemptions from the governmental services tax. Section 9 further: (1)
36 authorizes an authorized third party to charge its customers a convenience fee for
37 its services and sets forth a certain portion of each statutory fee for services which
38 may be retained by a Class I authorized third party; and (2) requires an authorized
39 third party to remit all fees due to the Department and collected by the authorized
40 third party not less than daily. Section 8 of this bill requires the Department to
41 provide a Class I authorized third party: (1) access to those portions of the
42 Department database or other technology systems required to provide the
43 authorized services; (2) training in the provision of such services; and (3) notice of
44 any relevant new regulations, policies or procedures; and (4) the ability to purchase
45 bulk amounts of certificates of registration, certificates or title, certain license
46 plates, decals, permits and other forms. Section 9 further requires the Department
47 to provide a Class II authorized third party: (1) access to make certain appointments
48 with the Department; (2) access to a separate window at each office of the
49 Department in an incorporated city whose population is 500,000 or more (currently
50 the City of Las Vegas); and (3) a written summary of certain policies and
51 procedures of the Department and the rights and responsibilities of Class II
52 authorized third parties.
53 Sections 1-4 and 17-78 of this bill make conforming changes authorizing an
54 authorized third party to perform certain services and duties designated to the
55 Department of a registered dealer under existing law consistent with sections 5-16.
56 Existing law requires that certain motor vehicles be tested for emissions in
57 certain counties in this State. (NRS 445B.770-445B.815) As part of the emissions
58 testing program, the Department collects fees for each set of forms purchased for
59 use to certify emission control compliance. (NRS 445B.830) Section 79 of this bill
60 requires the State Department of Conservation and Natural Resources to ensure that
61 such forms use the same terms regarding the make, model and features of a vehicle
62 as any other forms of the Department that are used for vehicle inspections.
63 Existing law imposes certain requirements on the towing of a vehicle from a
64 residential complex when the tow is at the request of a person other than the owner
65 of the vehicle. (NRS 706.4477) Section 80 of this bill requires a tow operator who
66 has been requested by the owner of the real property where the residential complex
-
*SB243*
– 3 –
67 is located, or an authorized agent of the owner, to tow a vehicle from the residential
68 complex based on a lack of registration of the vehicle to independently verify the
69 registration status of the vehicle before towing the vehicle. Under section 80, a tow
70 operator who fails to comply with that requirement is responsible for the cost of the
71 towing and storage of the vehicle.
72 Section 81 of this bill requires the Legislative Auditor to conduct an audit of
73 the Department which measures the accuracy and average time of completion of
74 transactions involving certain services that the Department of Motor Vehicles or an
75 agent of the Department may provide. The Legislative Auditor is required to
76 present a final written report to the Audit Subcommittee of the Legislative
77 Commission not later than July 1, 2026.

19 or nonrepairable vehicle; or
20 4. Falsifies or causes to be falsified an application or other
21 document submitted to the Department of Motor Vehicles or a

27 Sec. 61. NRS 281.050 is hereby amended to read as follows:
28 281.050 1. The residence of a person with reference to his or
29 her eligibility to any office is the person’s actual residence within
30 the State, county, district, ward, subdistrict or any other unit
31 prescribed by law, as the case may be, during all the period for
32 which residence is claimed by the person.
33 2. Except as otherwise provided in subsections 3 and 4, if any
34 person absents himself or herself from the jurisdiction of that
35 person’s actual residence with the intention in good faith to return
36 without delay and continue such actual residence, the period of
37 absence must not be considered in determining the question of
38 residence.
39 3. If a person who has filed a declaration of candidacy for any
40 elective office moves the person’s actual residence out of the State,
41 county, district, ward, subdistrict or any other unit prescribed by
42 law, as the case may be, in which the person is required actually, as
43 opposed to constructively, to reside in order for the person to be
44 eligible to the office, a vacancy is created thereby and the
45 appropriate action for filling the vacancy must be taken.
-
*SB243*
– 60 –
1 4. Once a person’s actual residence is fixed, the person shall be
2 deemed to have moved the person’s actual residence for the
3 purposes of this section if:
4 (a) The person has acted affirmatively and has actually removed
5 himself or herself from the place of permanent habitation where the
6 person actually resided and was legally domiciled;
7 (b) The person has an intention to abandon the place of
8 permanent habitation where the person actually resided and was
9 legally domiciled; and
10 (c) The person has an intention to remain in another place of
11 permanent habitation where the person actually resides and is
12 legally domiciled.
13 5. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection and NRS
14 293.1265, the district court has jurisdiction to determine the
15 question of residence in any preelection action for declaratory
16 judgment brought against a person who has filed a declaration of
17 candidacy for any elective office. If the question of residence relates
18 to whether an incumbent meets any qualification concerning
19 residence required for the term of office in which the incumbent is
20 presently serving, the district court does not have jurisdiction to
21 determine the question of residence in an action for declaratory
22 judgment brought by a person pursuant to this section but has
23 jurisdiction to determine the question of residence only in an action
24 to declare the office vacant that is authorized by NRS 283.040 and
25 brought by the Attorney General or the appropriate district attorney
26 pursuant to that section.
27 6. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 293.1265, if in any
28 preelection action for declaratory judgment, the district court finds
29 that a person who has filed a declaration of candidacy for any
30 elective office fails to meet any qualification concerning residence
31 required for the office pursuant to the Constitution or laws of this
32 State, the person is subject to the provisions of NRS 293.2045.
33 7. For the purposes of this section, in determining whether a
34 place of permanent habitation is the place where a person actually
35 resides and is legally domiciled:
36 (a) It is the public policy of this State to avoid sham residences
37 and to ensure that the person actually, as opposed to constructively,
38 resides in the area prescribed by law for the office so the person has
39 an actual connection with the constituents who reside in the area and
40 has particular knowledge of their concerns.
41 (b) The person may have more than one residence but only one
42 legal domicile, and the person’s legal domicile requires both the fact
43 of actual living in the place and the intention to remain there as a
44 permanent residence. If the person temporarily leaves the person’s
45 legal domicile, or leaves for a particular purpose, and does not take
-
*SB243*
– 61 –
1 up a permanent residence in another place, then the person’s legal
2 domicile has not changed. Once the person’s legal domicile is fixed,
3 the fact of actual living in another place, the intention to remain in
4 the other place and the intention to abandon the former legal
5 domicile must all exist before the person’s legal domicile can
6 change.
7 (c) Evidence of the person’s legal domicile includes, without
8 limitation:
9 (1) The place where the person lives the majority of the time
10 and the length of time the person has lived in that place.
11 (2) The place where the person lives with the person’s
12 spouse or domestic partner, if any.
13 (3) The place where the person lives with the person’s
14 children, dependents or relatives, if any.
15 (4) The place where the person lives with any other
16 individual whose relationship with the person is substantially similar
17 to a relationship with a spouse, domestic partner, child, dependent or
18 relative.
19 (5) The place where the person’s dogs, cats or other pets, if
20 any, live.
21 (6) The place listed as the person’s residential address on the
22 voter registration card, as defined in NRS 293.1205, issued to the
23 person.
24 (7) The place listed as the person’s residential address on any
25 driver’s license or identification card issued to the person by the
26 Department of Motor Vehicles, any passport or military
27 identification card issued to the person by the United States or any
28 other form of identification issued to the person by a governmental
29 agency.
30 (8) The place listed as the person’s residential address on any
31 registration for a motor vehicle issued to the person by the
32 Department of Motor Vehicles or a Class I authorized third party
33 or any registration for another type of vehicle or mode of
34 transportation, including, without limitation, any aircraft, vessels or
35 watercraft, issued to the person by a governmental agency.
36 (9) The place listed as the person’s residential address on any
37 applications for issuance or renewal of any license, certificate,
38 registration, permit or similar type of authorization issued to the
39 person by a governmental agency which has the authority to
40 regulate an occupation or profession.
41 (10) The place listed as the person’s residential address on
42 any document which the person is authorized or required by law to
43 file or record with a governmental agency, including, without
44 limitation, any deed, declaration of homestead or other record of
45 real or personal property, any applications for services, privileges or
-
*SB243*
– 62 –
1 benefits or any tax documents, forms or returns, but excluding the
2 person’s declaration of candidacy.
3 (11) The place listed as the person’s residential address on
4 any type of check, payment, benefit or reimbursement issued to the
5 person by a governmental agency or by any type of company that
6 provides insurance, workers’ compensation, health care or medical
7 benefits or any self-insured employer or third-party administrator.
8 (12) The place listed as the person’s residential address on
9 the person’s paycheck, paystub or employment records.
10 (13) The place listed as the person’s residential address on
11 the person’s bank statements, insurance statements, mortgage
12 statements, loan statements, financial accounts, credit card accounts,
13 utility accounts or other billing statements or accounts.
14 (14) The place where the person receives mail or deliveries
15 from the United States Postal Service or commercial carriers.
16 (d) The evidence listed in paragraph (c) is intended to be
17 illustrative and is not intended to be exhaustive or exclusive. The
18 presence or absence of any particular type of evidence listed in
19 paragraph (c) is not, by itself, determinative of the person’s legal
20 domicile, but such a determination must be based upon all the facts
21 and circumstances of the person’s particular case.
22 8. As used in this section:
23 (a) “Actual residence” means the place of permanent habitation
24 where a person actually resides and is legally domiciled. If the
25 person maintains more than one place of permanent habitation, the
26 place the person declares to be the person’s principal permanent
27 habitation when filing a declaration of candidacy for any elective
28 office must be the place where the person actually resides and is
29 legally domiciled in order for the person to be eligible to the office.

10 laws, ordinances and codes of a local government:
11 (a) The person requesting the towing must be the owner of the
12 real property from which the vehicle is towed or an authorized agent
13 of the owner of the real property and must sign a specific request for
14 the towing. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2, for the

29 property:
30 (a) Must:
31 (1) Meet the requirements of subsection 1.
32 (2) Except as otherwise provided in this subparagraph, if the

16 expired is a violation of this section, subject to the provisions of
17 subsection [9.] 10.

AN ACT relating to motor vehicles; authorizing the Department of
Motor Vehicles to license certain persons as Class I
authorized third parties to provide registration, titling and
other services; setting forth the fees and other
requirements for licensure as a Class I authorized third
party; setting forth the services a Class I or Class II

other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires a person who wishes to engage in the business of a
2 document preparation service to register with the Secretary of State. (NRS
3 240A.100) A document preparation service is a person who, for compensation,
4 provides assistance to a client with certain legal matters, including preparing or
5 completing a pleading, application or other document and submitting a completed
6 document on behalf of a client to a court or administration agency.
7 (NRS 240A.030)
8 This bill authorizes a document preparation service to additionally operate as
9 either a Class I or Class II authorized third party. Sections 5-7 of this bill define
10 terms related to authorized third parties, including the terms “Class I authorized
11 third party” and “Class II authorized third party.” Section 10 of this bill authorizes
-
*SB243*

– 2 –
12 a person to engage in the activities of a Class II authorized third party if the person
13 is registered as a document preparation service and holds a local business license.
14 Section 11 of this bill prohibits a person from acting as a Class I authorized third
15 party without a license issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles and provides
16 the requirements to obtain a license, including, without limitation, being registered
17 as a document preparation service, providing fingerprints and passing a criminal
18 background check. Sections 12-14 of this bill establish: (1) additional requirements
19 to obtain or renew a license as a Class I authorized third party; and (2) grounds for
20 the Department to refuse to issue or renew, or to suspend or revoke a license as a
21 Class I authorized third party. Section 15 of this bill provides the circumstances
22 under which an employee of a Class I authorized third party may provide certain
23 services. Section 16 of this bill requires an authorized third party to obtain and
24 compile any records required by the Department.
25 Section 9 of this bill sets forth the services that a Class I and Class II
26 authorized third party may provide, which are: (1) providing applications for
27 certain motor vehicle and off-highway vehicle registration and titling services; (2)
28 accepting those applications; (3) obtaining on behalf of a customer or, in the case of
29 a Class I authorized third party, issuing certificates of registration, certificates of
30 title, certain license plates, decals and certain permits authorizing the travel on the
31 highways of this State of an unregistered vehicle in certain circumstances; (4)
32 notarizing certain documents; (5) submitting change of address information; (6)
33 accepting license plates that are required to be surrendered to the Department; and
34 (7) submitting information to the Department on behalf of customers claiming
35 certain exemptions from the governmental services tax. Section 9 further: (1)
36 authorizes an authorized third party to charge its customers a convenience fee for
37 its services and sets forth a certain portion of each statutory fee for services which
38 may be retained by a Class I authorized third party; and (2) requires an authorized
39 third party to remit all fees due to the Department and collected by the authorized
40 third party not less than daily. Section 8 of this bill requires the Department to
41 provide a Class I authorized third party: (1) access to those portions of the
42 Department database or other technology systems required to provide the
43 authorized services; (2) training in the provision of such services; and (3) notice of
44 any relevant new regulations, policies or procedures; and (4) the ability to purchase
45 bulk amounts of certificates of registration, certificates or title, certain license
46 plates, decals, permits and other forms. Section 9 further requires the Department
47 to provide a Class II authorized third party: (1) access to make certain appointments
48 with the Department; (2) access to a separate window at each office of the
49 Department in an incorporated city whose population is 500,000 or more (currently
50 the City of Las Vegas); and (3) a written summary of certain policies and
51 procedures of the Department and the rights and responsibilities of Class II
52 authorized third parties.
53 Sections 1-4 and 17-78 of this bill make conforming changes authorizing an
54 authorized third party to perform certain services and duties designated to the
55 Department of a registered dealer under existing law consistent with sections 5-16.
56 Existing law requires that certain motor vehicles be tested for emissions in
57 certain counties in this State. (NRS 445B.770-445B.815) As part of the emissions
58 testing program, the Department collects fees for each set of forms purchased for
59 use to certify emission control compliance. (NRS 445B.830) Section 79 of this bill
60 requires the State Department of Conservation and Natural Resources to ensure that
61 such forms use the same terms regarding the make, model and features of a vehicle
62 as any other forms of the Department that are used for vehicle inspections.
63 Existing law imposes certain requirements on the towing of a vehicle from a
64 residential complex when the tow is at the request of a person other than the owner
65 of the vehicle. (NRS 706.4477) Section 80 of this bill requires a tow operator who
66 has been requested by the owner of the real property where the residential complex
-
*SB243*

– 3 –
67 is located, or an authorized agent of the owner, to tow a vehicle from the residential
68 complex based on a lack of registration of the vehicle to independently verify the
69 registration status of the vehicle before towing the vehicle. Under section 80, a tow
70 operator who fails to comply with that requirement is responsible for the cost of the
71 towing and storage of the vehicle.
72 Section 81 of this bill requires the Legislative Auditor to conduct an audit of
73 the Department which measures the accuracy and average time of completion of
74 transactions involving certain services that the Department of Motor Vehicles or an
75 agent of the Department may provide. The Legislative Auditor is required to
76 present a final written report to the Audit Subcommittee of the Legislative
77 Commission not later than July 1, 2026.

29 her eligibility to any office is the person’s actual residence within
30 the State, county, district, ward, subdistrict or any other unit
31 prescribed by law, as the case may be, during all the period for
32 which residence is claimed by the person.
33 2. Except as otherwise provided in subsections 3 and 4, if any
34 person absents himself or herself from the jurisdiction of that
35 person’s actual residence with the intention in good faith to return
36 without delay and continue such actual residence, the period of
37 absence must not be considered in determining the question of
38 residence.
39 3. If a person who has filed a declaration of candidacy for any
40 elective office moves the person’s actual residence out of the State,
41 county, district, ward, subdistrict or any other unit prescribed by
42 law, as the case may be, in which the person is required actually, as
43 opposed to constructively, to reside in order for the person to be
44 eligible to the office, a vacancy is created thereby and the
45 appropriate action for filling the vacancy must be taken.
-
*SB243*

– 60 –
1 4. Once a person’s actual residence is fixed, the person shall be
2 deemed to have moved the person’s actual residence for the
3 purposes of this section if:
4 (a) The person has acted affirmatively and has actually removed
5 himself or herself from the place of permanent habitation where the
6 person actually resided and was legally domiciled;
7 (b) The person has an intention to abandon the place of
8 permanent habitation where the person actually resided and was
9 legally domiciled; and
10 (c) The person has an intention to remain in another place of
11 permanent habitation where the person actually resides and is
12 legally domiciled.
13 5. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection and NRS
14 293.1265, the district court has jurisdiction to determine the
15 question of residence in any preelection action for declaratory
16 judgment brought against a person who has filed a declaration of
17 candidacy for any elective office. If the question of residence relates
18 to whether an incumbent meets any qualification concerning
19 residence required for the term of office in which the incumbent is
20 presently serving, the district court does not have jurisdiction to
21 determine the question of residence in an action for declaratory
22 judgment brought by a person pursuant to this section but has
23 jurisdiction to determine the question of residence only in an action
24 to declare the office vacant that is authorized by NRS 283.040 and
25 brought by the Attorney General or the appropriate district attorney
26 pursuant to that section.
27 6. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 293.1265, if in any
28 preelection action for declaratory judgment, the district court finds
29 that a person who has filed a declaration of candidacy for any
30 elective office fails to meet any qualification concerning residence
31 required for the office pursuant to the Constitution or laws of this
32 State, the person is subject to the provisions of NRS 293.2045.
33 7. For the purposes of this section, in determining whether a
34 place of permanent habitation is the place where a person actually
35 resides and is legally domiciled:
36 (a) It is the public policy of this State to avoid sham residences
37 and to ensure that the person actually, as opposed to constructively,
38 resides in the area prescribed by law for the office so the person has
39 an actual connection with the constituents who reside in the area and
40 has particular knowledge of their concerns.
41 (b) The person may have more than one residence but only one
42 legal domicile, and the person’s legal domicile requires both the fact
43 of actual living in the place and the intention to remain there as a
44 permanent residence. If the person temporarily leaves the person’s
45 legal domicile, or leaves for a particular purpose, and does not take
-
*SB243*

– 61 –
1 up a permanent residence in another place, then the person’s legal
2 domicile has not changed. Once the person’s legal domicile is fixed,
3 the fact of actual living in another place, the intention to remain in
4 the other place and the intention to abandon the former legal
5 domicile must all exist before the person’s legal domicile can
6 change.
7 (c) Evidence of the person’s legal domicile includes, without
8 limitation:
9 (1) The place where the person lives the majority of the time
10 and the length of time the person has lived in that place.
11 (2) The place where the person lives with the person’s
12 spouse or domestic partner, if any.
