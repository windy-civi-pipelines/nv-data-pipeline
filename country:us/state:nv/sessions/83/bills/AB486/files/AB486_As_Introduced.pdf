5 Existing law requires a person who sells a new tire for a vehicle to a customer
6 for certain purposes to collect from the purchaser a fee of $1 per tire to be held in
7 trust for the State. The seller then must: (1) transmit 95 percent of the money held
8 in trust to the Department of Taxation for deposit with the State Treasurer for credit
9 to the Solid Waste Management Account in the State General Fund; and (2) retain
10 the remaining 5 percent to cover related administrative costs. (NRS 444A.090)
11 Section 2 of this bill increases the fee collected by the seller to $2 per tire and, once
12 the 95 percent of the money is transmitted to the Department of Taxation for
13 deposit with the State Treasurer, requires the State Treasurer to credit half of the
14 money to the Wildlife Crossings Account in the State General Fund and the other
15 half of the money to the Solid Waste Management Account in the State General
16 Fund.
17 Section 1 of this bill requires that any money credited to the Wildlife Crossings
18 Account from the fee imposed pursuant to section 2 be deposited in the State
19 Treasury for credit to the Account.
