15 trust for the State. The seller then must: (1) transmit 95 percent of the money held
16 in trust to the Department of Taxation for deposit with the State Treasurer for credit
17 to the Solid Waste Management Account in the State General Fund; and (2) retain
18 the remaining 5 percent to cover related administrative costs. (NRS 444A.090)
