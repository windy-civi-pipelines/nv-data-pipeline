FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to wildlife; revising provisions relating to the proposal for
certain highway projects the Department of Transportation must
submit to the Board of Directors of the Department; revising
provisions relating to the Wildlife Crossings Account; increasing the
fee collected from a purchaser of new tires and requiring a certain
amount of the proceeds to be credited to the Account; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Department of Transportation to prepare a written
2 analysis of the costs and benefits of each proposal for a highway project that will cost
3 $25 million or more. (NRS 408.3195) Section 1 of this bill instead requires that the
4 Department prepare such an analysis of each proposal for a highway project that will
5 cost $50 million or more. Section 1 additionally requires the Department to include in
6 the analysis for a highway project proposal a discussion of the value of any mitigation of
7 wildlife-vehicle collisions from the design, construction and use of wildlife crossings.
8 Existing law creates the Wildlife Crossings Account in the State General Fund, which is
9 administered by the Director of the Department of Transportation. Existing law requires the
10 money in the Account to be used by the Department for certain purposes relating to wildlife
11 crossings. (NRS 408.656)
12 Existing law requires a person who sells a new tire for a vehicle to a customer for certain
13 purposes to collect from the purchaser a fee of $1 per tire to be held in trust for the State. The
14 seller then must: (1) transmit 95 percent of the money held in trust to the Department of
15 Taxation for deposit with the State Treasurer for credit to the Solid Waste Management
16 Account in the State General Fund; and (2) retain the remaining 5 percent to cover related
17 administrative costs. (NRS 444A.090) Section 2 of this bill increases the fee collected by the
18 seller to $2 per tire and, once the 95 percent of the money is transmitted to the Department of
19 Taxation for deposit with the State Treasurer, requires the State Treasurer to credit half of the
20 money to the Wildlife Crossings Account in the State General Fund and the other half of the
21 money to the Solid Waste Management Account in the State General Fund.
22 Section [1] 1.5 of this bill requires that any money credited to the Wildlife Crossings
23 Account from the fee imposed pursuant to section 2 be deposited in the State Treasury for
24 credit to the Account.
