AN ACT relating to transportation; requiring the Department of
Transportation to report certain information on the

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Department of Transportation to develop an inventory
2 of connectivity needs on the state highway system where the implementation of
3 wildlife crossings and other related highway features will support certain purposes
4 relating to wildlife. (NRS 408.661) Existing law also requires the Department to
5 adopt a plan for measuring the performance of the Department and prepare a report
6 based upon certain performance measures on the level of achievement of each
7 division of the Department and the Department as a whole which must include,
8 among other requirements, the scheduling, scope, cost and progress of any current
9 or proposed highway projects. (408.133) Section 1 of this bill requires that the
10 information in the report prepared by the Department relating to current and
11 proposed highway projects include the progress of any current or proposed project
12 identified in the inventory of connectivity and the need for such a project.
13 Existing law further requires the Department to prepare a written analysis of the
14 costs and benefits of each proposal for a highway project that will cost $25 million
15 or more. (NRS 408.3195) Section 1.3 of this bill instead requires that the
16 Department prepare such an analysis of each proposal for a highway project that
17 will cost $50 million or more. Section 1.3 additionally requires the Department to
18 include in the analysis for a highway project proposal a discussion of the value of
19 any mitigation of wildlife-vehicle collisions from the design, construction and use
20 of wildlife crossings.
