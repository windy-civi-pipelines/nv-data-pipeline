AN ACT relating to transportation; requiring the Department of Transportation to

Department; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Department of Transportation to develop an inventory of
2 connectivity needs on the state highway system where the implementation of wildlife
3 crossings and other related highway features will support certain purposes relating to wildlife.
4 (NRS 408.661) Existing law also requires : (1) the Board of Directors of the Department to
5 adopt a plan for measuring the performance of the Department ; and (2) the Director of the
6 Department to prepare a report , based upon certain performance [measures] measurements,
7 on the level of achievement of each division of the Department and the Department as a whole
8 which must include, among other requirements, the scheduling, scope, cost and progress of
9 any current or proposed highway projects. (NRS 408.133) Section 1 of this bill requires that
10 the information in the report prepared by the [Department] Director relating to current and
11 proposed highway projects include the progress of any current or proposed project identified
12 in the inventory of connectivity and the need for such a project.
13 Existing law requires each Deputy Director of the Department to: (1) hold a
14 master’s degree in public or business administration, or meet certain other educational
15 requirements; and (2) have at least 15 years of progressively responsible experience in

25 analysis of each proposal for a highway project that will cost $50 million or more. Section 1.3
26 additionally requires the Department to include in the analysis for a highway project proposal
27 a discussion of the number of wildlife-vehicle collisions in the highway district and the
Senate Amendment No. 598 to Assembly Bill No. 486 Second Reprint Page 4
28 value of any mitigation of wildlife-vehicle collisions from the design, construction and use of
