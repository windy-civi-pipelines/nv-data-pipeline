AN ACT relating to [wildlife;] transportation; requiring the Department of
Transportation to report certain information on the progress and
need for certain transportation projects relating to wildlife;
revising provisions relating to the proposal for certain highway projects
the Department of Transportation must submit to the Board of
Directors of the Department; [revising provisions relating to the
Wildlife Crossings Account; increasing the fee collected from a
purchaser of new tires and requiring a certain amount of the proceeds
to be credited to the Account;] and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Department of Transportation to develop an inventory of
2 connectivity needs on the state highway system where the implementation of wildlife
3 crossings and other related highway features will support certain purposes relating to
4 wildlife. (NRS 408.661) Existing law also requires the Department to adopt a plan for
5 measuring the performance of the Department and prepare a report based upon certain
6 performance measures on the level of achievement of each division of the Department
7 and the Department as a whole which must include, among other requirements, the
8 scheduling, scope, cost and progress of any current or proposed highway projects.
9 (408.133) Section 1 of this bill requires that the information in the report prepared by
10 the Department relating to current and proposed highway projects include the progress
11 of any current or proposed project identified in the inventory of connectivity and the
12 need for such a project.
13 Existing law further requires the Department to prepare a written analysis of the costs
14 and benefits of each proposal for a highway project that will cost $25 million or more. (NRS
15 408.3195) Section [1] 1.3 of this bill instead requires that the Department prepare such an
16 analysis of each proposal for a highway project that will cost $50 million or more. Section [1]
17 1.3 additionally requires the Department to include in the analysis for a highway project
18 proposal a discussion of the value of any mitigation of wildlife-vehicle collisions from the
19 design, construction and use of wildlife crossings.
20 [Existing law creates the Wildlife Crossings Account in the State General Fund, which is
21 administered by the Director of the Department of Transportation. Existing law requires the

Assembly Amendment No. 540 to Assembly Bill No. 486 First Reprint Page 4
22 money in the Account to be used by the Department for certain purposes relating to wildlife
23 crossings . (NRS 408.656)
24 Existing law requires a person who sells a new tire for a vehicle to a customer for certain
25 purposes to collect from the purchaser a fee of $1 per tire to be held in trust for the State. The
26 seller then must: (1) transmit 95 percent of the money held in trust to the Department of
27 Taxation for deposit with the State Treasurer for credit to the Solid Waste Management
28 Account in the State General Fund; and (2) retain the remaining 5 percent to cover related
29 administrative costs. (NRS 444A.090) Section 2 of this bill increases the fee collected by the
30 seller to $2 per tire and, once the 95 percent of the money is transmitted to the Department of
31 Taxation for deposit with the State Treasurer, requires the State Treasurer to credit half of the
32 money to the Wildlife Crossings Account in the State General Fund and the other half of the
33 money to the Solid Waste Management Account in the State General Fund.
34 Section 1.5 of this bill requires that any money credited to the Wildlife Crossings
35 Account from the fee imposed pursuant to section 2 be deposited in the State Treasury for
36 credit to the Account.]
