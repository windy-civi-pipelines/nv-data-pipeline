CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to transportation; requiring the Department of
Transportation to report certain information on the progress
and need for certain transportation projects relating to
wildlife; revising the qualifications for a Deputy Director of
the Department; revising provisions relating to the proposal
for certain highway projects the Department must submit to
the Board of Directors of the Department; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law requires the Department of Transportation to develop an inventory
of connectivity needs on the state highway system where the implementation of
wildlife crossings and other related highway features will support certain purposes
relating to wildlife. (NRS 408.661) Existing law also requires: (1) the Board of
Directors of the Department to adopt a plan for measuring the performance of the
Department; and (2) the Director of the Department to prepare a report, based upon
certain performance measurements, on the level of achievement of each division of
the Department and the Department as a whole which must include, among other
requirements, the scheduling, scope, cost and progress of any current or proposed
highway projects. (NRS 408.133) Section 1 of this bill requires that the information
in the report prepared by the Director relating to current and proposed highway
projects include the progress of any current or proposed project identified in the
inventory of connectivity and the need for such a project.
Existing law requires each Deputy Director of the Department to: (1) hold a
master’s degree in public or business administration, or meet certain other
educational requirements; and (2) have at least 15 years of progressively
responsible experience in engineering or project management, or meet certain other
experiential requirements. (NRS 408.178) Section 1.1 of this bill instead requires
each Deputy Director to: (1) hold a bachelor’s degree in business, economics or
public or business administration, or meet certain other educational requirements;
and (2) have at least 15 years of progressively responsible experience in
engineering, project management, business or economics, or meet certain other
experiential requirements.
Existing law further requires the Department to prepare a written analysis of the
costs and benefits of each proposal for a highway project that will cost $25 million
or more. (NRS 408.3195) Section 1.3 of this bill instead requires that the
Department prepare such an analysis of each proposal for a highway project that
will cost $50 million or more. Section 1.3 additionally requires the Department to
include in the analysis for a highway project proposal a discussion of the number of
wildlife-vehicle collisions in the highway district and the value of any mitigation of
wildlife-vehicle collisions from the design, construction and use of wildlife
crossings.
