AN ACT relating to animals; requiring certain persons that allow
interactions between live animals and members of the
public to post a sign with the contact information for the
local animal control authority; providing an
administrative penalty; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law: (1) prohibits a person from engaging in cruelty to animals; and
2 (2) authorizes any person who knows or has reasonable cause to believe that an
3 animal has been subject to an act of cruelty to report that act to a peace officer, an
4 officer of a society for the prevention of cruelty to animals that is authorized to
5 make arrests or an animal control officer. (NRS 574.053, 574.100) This bill
6 requires the owner or operator of a commercial establishment engaged in the
7 business of selling access to live animals to interact with members of the public to
8 post a sign of a certain size at the location in the commercial establishment where
9 payment is made: (1) notifying the public that if a person believes that an animal is
10 in danger or has been subjected to an act of animal cruelty, the person may contact
11 the local animal control authority; and (2) providing the telephone number for such
12 authority. This bill also: (1) imposes an administrative penalty against an owner or
13 operator of such a commercial establishment who fails to conspicuously post the
14 sign; and (2) exempts an accredited institutional member of the Association of Zoos
15 and Aquariums from the requirement to post such a sign.
