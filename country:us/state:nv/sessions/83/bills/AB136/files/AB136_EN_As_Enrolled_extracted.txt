Section 1:
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to animals; requiring certain persons that allow
interactions between live animals and members of the public
to post a sign with the contact information for the local
animal control authority; providing an administrative penalty;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law: (1) prohibits a person from engaging in cruelty to animals; and
(2) authorizes any person who knows or has reasonable cause to believe that an
animal has been subject to an act of cruelty to report that act to a peace officer, an
officer of a society for the prevention of cruelty to animals that is authorized to
make arrests or an animal control officer. (NRS 574.053, 574.100) This bill
requires the owner or operator of a commercial establishment engaged in the
business of selling access to live animals to interact with members of the public to
post a sign of a certain size at the location in the commercial establishment where
payment is made: (1) notifying the public that if a person believes that an animal is
in danger or has been subjected to an act of animal cruelty, the person may contact
the local animal control authority; and (2) providing the telephone number for such
authority. This bill also: (1) imposes an administrative penalty against an owner or
operator of such a commercial establishment who fails to conspicuously post the
sign; and (2) exempts an accredited institutional member of the Association of Zoos
and Aquariums from the requirement to post such a sign.
