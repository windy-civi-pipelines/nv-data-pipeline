EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.

public or] allow interactions between live animals and members of the

animal control authority; providing an administrative penalty; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law: (1) prohibits a person from engaging in cruelty to animals; and (2)
2 authorizes any person who knows or has reasonable cause to believe that an animal has been
3 subject to an act of cruelty to report that act to a peace officer, an officer of a society for the
4 prevention of cruelty to animals that is authorized to make arrests or an animal control officer.
5 (NRS 574.053, 574.100) This bill requires the owner or operator of [an animal shelter or any]
6 a commercial establishment engaged in the business of selling [or displaying animals to the
7 public or allowing] access to live animals to interact with members of the public to post a
8 [notice near the enclosure of the animal:] sign of a certain size at the location in the
9 commercial establishment where payment is made: (1) notifying the public that if a person
10 believes that [the] an animal is in danger [, is being treated poorly] or has been subjected to an
11 act of animal cruelty, the person may contact the local animal control authority; and (2)
12 providing the telephone number for such authority. This bill also: (1) imposes an
13 administrative penalty against an owner or operator of such a commercial establishment
14 who fails to conspicuously post the sign; and (2) exempts an accredited institutional
15 member of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums from the requirement to post such a
16 sign.
