Assembly Bill No. 258–Assemblymembers Moore;
Kasama and La Rue Hatch
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to real estate; requiring brokerage agreements to
be in writing; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of real estate brokers,
real estate broker-salespersons and real estate salespersons by the Real Estate
Division of the Department of Business and Industry. (Chapter 645 of NRS)
Existing law defines “brokerage agreement” to mean an oral or written contract
between a client and a broker in which the broker agrees to accept valuable
consideration from the client for assisting, soliciting or negotiating the sale,
purchase, option, rental or lease of real property, or the sale, exchange, option or
purchase of a business. (NRS 645.005) Existing law imposes various requirements
relating to such brokerage agreements, including, without limitation, requirements
concerning: (1) the duties of a licensee who has entered into a brokerage agreement
to represent a client in a real estate transaction; (2) the delivery of a copy of a
brokerage agreement to a client; and (3) the form and contents of a brokerage
agreement which includes a provision for exclusive representation. (NRS 645.254,
645.300, 645.320) Section 2 of this bill revises the definition of “brokerage
agreement” to remove provisions which provide that an oral contract may constitute
a brokerage agreement, thereby requiring a brokerage agreement to be in writing.
Sections 1, 3 and 5 of this bill revise references to written brokerage
agreements to reflect that, under section 2, a contract is required to be in writing to
constitute a brokerage agreement. Section 4 of this bill similarly eliminates a
requirement that certain brokerage agreements be in writing which is made
redundant by section 2.

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
Section 1. NRS 624.031 is hereby amended to read as follows:
624.031 The provisions of this chapter do not apply to:

of the United States Government, the State of Nevada, or an
incorporated city, county, irrigation district, reclamation district, or
other municipal or political corporation or subdivision of this State.

residential structure on the property for his or her own occupancy
and not intended for sale or lease. The sale or lease, or the offering
for sale or lease, of the newly built structure within 1 year after its
completion creates a rebuttable presumption for the purposes of this
section that the building of the structure was performed with the
intent to sell or lease that structure. An owner of property who
requests an exemption pursuant to this subsection must apply to the
Board for the exemption. The Board shall adopt regulations setting
forth the requirements for granting the exemption.
6. Any work to repair or maintain property the value of which
is less than $1,000, including labor and materials, unless:
(a) A building permit is required to perform the work;
(b) The work is of a type performed by a plumbing, electrical,
refrigeration, heating or air-conditioning contractor;
(c) The work is of a type performed by a contractor licensed in a
classification prescribed by the Board that significantly affects the
health, safety and welfare of members of the general public;
(d) The work is performed as a part of a larger project:
(1) The value of which is $500 or more; or
(2) For which contracts of less than $500 have been awarded
to evade the provisions of this chapter; or
(e) The work is performed by a person who is licensed pursuant
to this chapter or by an employee of that person.
7. The sale or installation of any finished product, material or
article of merchandise which is not fabricated into and does not
become a permanent fixed part of the structure.
8. The construction, alteration, improvement or repair of
personal property.

9. The construction, alteration, improvement or repair financed
in whole or in part by the Federal Government and conducted within
the limits and boundaries of a site or reservation, the title of which
rests in the Federal Government.
10. An owner of property, the primary use of which is as an
agricultural or farming enterprise, building or improving a structure
on the property for his or her use or occupancy and not intended for
sale or lease.

recovery group by a qualified person within a particular geographic
area that is described in a proclamation of a state of emergency or
declaration of disaster by the State or Federal Government,
including, without limitation, pursuant to NRS 414.070. A long-
term recovery group may reimburse such reasonable expenses as the
qualified person incurs in providing construction oversight services
to that group. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection,
nothing in this subsection authorizes a person who is not a licensed
contractor to perform the acts described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of
subsection 1 of NRS 624.700. As used in this subsection:
(a) “Construction oversight services” means the coordination
and oversight of labor by volunteers.

volunteers coordinating response and recovery efforts related to a
state of emergency or disaster that is proclaimed or declared by the
State or Federal Government.
(c) “Qualified person” means a person who possesses the
abilities, education, experience, knowledge, skills and training that a
long-term recovery group has identified as being necessary to
provide construction oversight services for a project to be performed
by that group.
12. A person licensed as a real estate broker, real estate broker-
salesperson or real estate salesperson pursuant to chapter 645 of
NRS who, acting within the scope of the license or a permit to
engage in property management issued pursuant to NRS 645.6052,
assists a client in scheduling work to repair or maintain residential
property pursuant to a [written] brokerage agreement or a property
management agreement. Such assistance includes, without
limitation, assisting a client in the hiring of any number of licensed
contractors to perform the work. Nothing in this subsection
authorizes the performance of any work for which a license is
required pursuant to this chapter by a person who is not licensed
pursuant to this chapter or the payment of any additional
compensation to a person licensed as a real estate broker, real estate

agreement.
