Referred to Committee on Commerce and Labor
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to brokerage agreements.
(BDR 54-741)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to real estate; requiring brokerage agreements to
be in writing; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of real estate brokers,
2 real estate broker-salespersons and real estate salespersons by the Real Estate
3 Division of the Department of Business and Industry. (Chapter 645 of NRS)
4 Existing law defines “brokerage agreement” to mean an oral or written contract
5 between a client and a broker in which the broker agrees to accept valuable
6 consideration from the client for assisting, soliciting or negotiating the sale,
7 purchase, option, rental or lease of real property, or the sale, exchange, option or
8 purchase of a business. (NRS 645.005) Existing law imposes various requirements
9 relating to such brokerage agreements, including, without limitation, requirements
10 concerning: (1) the duties of a licensee who has entered into a brokerage agreement
11 to represent a client in a real estate transaction; (2) the delivery of a copy of a
12 brokerage agreement to a client; and (3) the form and contents of a brokerage
13 agreement which includes a provision for exclusive representation. (NRS 645.254,
14 645.300, 645.320) Section 2 of this bill revises the definition of “brokerage
15 agreement” to remove provisions which provide that an oral contract may constitute
16 a brokerage agreement, thereby requiring a brokerage agreement to be in writing.
17 Sections 1, 3 and 5 of this bill revise references to written brokerage
18 agreements to reflect that, under section 2, a contract is required to be in writing to
19 constitute a brokerage agreement. Section 4 of this bill similarly eliminates a
20 requirement that certain brokerage agreements be in writing which is made
21 redundant by section 2.

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 624.031 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 624.031 The provisions of this chapter do not apply to:
3 1. Work performed exclusively by an authorized representative
4 of the United States Government, the State of Nevada, or an
5 incorporated city, county, irrigation district, reclamation district, or
6 other municipal or political corporation or subdivision of this State.
7 2. Any entity that is recognized as exempt under section
8 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. § 501(c)(3),
9 which:
10 (a) Enters into a contract or other agreement with the State of
11 Nevada, or an incorporated city, county, irrigation district,
12 reclamation district, or other municipal or political corporation or
13 subdivision of this State, to facilitate the repair or maintenance of
14 properties, including, without limitation, weatherization and energy
15 efficiency services;
16 (b) Facilitates work to be performed on such a property by a
17 person licensed pursuant to this chapter; and
18 (c) Is a party with the owner of such a property and a person
19 licensed pursuant to this chapter to a contract or agreement for the
20 work on the property.
21 3. An officer of a court when acting within the scope of his or

23 4. Work performed exclusively by a public utility operating

26 incidental to its business.
27 5. An owner of property who is building or improving a
28 residential structure on the property for his or her own occupancy
29 and not intended for sale or lease. The sale or lease, or the offering
30 for sale or lease, of the newly built structure within 1 year after its
31 completion creates a rebuttable presumption for the purposes of this
32 section that the building of the structure was performed with the
33 intent to sell or lease that structure. An owner of property who
34 requests an exemption pursuant to this subsection must apply to the
35 Board for the exemption. The Board shall adopt regulations setting
36 forth the requirements for granting the exemption.
37 6. Any work to repair or maintain property the value of which
38 is less than $1,000, including labor and materials, unless:
39 (a) A building permit is required to perform the work;
40 (b) The work is of a type performed by a plumbing, electrical,
41 refrigeration, heating or air-conditioning contractor;

2 classification prescribed by the Board that significantly affects the
3 health, safety and welfare of members of the general public;

7 to evade the provisions of this chapter; or
8 (e) The work is performed by a person who is licensed pursuant
9 to this chapter or by an employee of that person.
10 7. The sale or installation of any finished product, material or
11 article of merchandise which is not fabricated into and does not
12 become a permanent fixed part of the structure.
13 8. The construction, alteration, improvement or repair of
14 personal property.
15 9. The construction, alteration, improvement or repair financed
16 in whole or in part by the Federal Government and conducted within
17 the limits and boundaries of a site or reservation, the title of which
18 rests in the Federal Government.
19 10. An owner of property, the primary use of which is as an
20 agricultural or farming enterprise, building or improving a structure
21 on the property for his or her use or occupancy and not intended for
22 sale or lease.
23 11. Construction oversight services provided to a long-term
24 recovery group by a qualified person within a particular geographic
25 area that is described in a proclamation of a state of emergency or
26 declaration of disaster by the State or Federal Government,
27 including, without limitation, pursuant to NRS 414.070. A long-
28 term recovery group may reimburse such reasonable expenses as the
29 qualified person incurs in providing construction oversight services
30 to that group. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection,
31 nothing in this subsection authorizes a person who is not a licensed
32 contractor to perform the acts described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of
33 subsection 1 of NRS 624.700. As used in this subsection:
34 (a) “Construction oversight services” means the coordination
35 and oversight of labor by volunteers.

38 state of emergency or disaster that is proclaimed or declared by the
39 State or Federal Government.
40 (c) “Qualified person” means a person who possesses the
41 abilities, education, experience, knowledge, skills and training that a
