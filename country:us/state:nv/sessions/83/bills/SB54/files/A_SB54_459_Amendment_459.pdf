AN ACT relating to Medicaid; requiring Medicaid to provide coverage for medical
respite care for persons experiencing homelessness, if federal financial
participation is available; requiring the development of a model for
providing such medical respite care; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Department of Health and Human Services to administer
2 Medicaid. (NRS 422.270) If Federal financial participation is available, section 1 of this bill
3 requires the Director of the Department to include coverage under Medicaid for medical
4 respite care provided to persons experiencing homelessness, by a facility that meets certain
5 requirements. Section 1 requires the Department to apply to the Federal Government for any
6 waiver or amendment necessary to receive federal financial participation to provide such
7 coverage. Section 1 defines “medical respite care” to refer to certain medical care and support
8 services. Section 1 additionally requires the Division of Health Care Financing and Policy of
9 the Department to coordinate with the Division of Public and Behavioral Health of the
10 Department to develop a model for providing medical respite care to persons experiencing
11 homelessness. Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to indicate that the provisions
12 of section 1 will be administered in the same manner as the provisions of existing law
13 governing Medicaid.
