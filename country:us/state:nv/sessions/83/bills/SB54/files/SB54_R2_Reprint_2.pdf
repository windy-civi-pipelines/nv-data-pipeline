5 experiencing homelessness by a facility that meets certain requirements. Section 1
6 requires the Department to apply to the Federal Government for any waiver or
7 amendment necessary to receive federal financial participation to provide such
8 coverage. Section 1 defines “medical respite care” to refer to certain medical care
9 and support services. Section 1 additionally requires the Division of Health Care
10 Financing and Policy of the Department to coordinate with the Division of Public
11 and Behavioral Health of the Department to develop a model for providing medical
12 respite care to persons experiencing homelessness. Section 2 of this bill makes a
13 conforming change to indicate that the provisions of section 1 will be administered
14 in the same manner as the provisions of existing law governing Medicaid.
