AN ACT relating to Medicaid; requiring Medicaid to provide coverage for medical
respite care for persons experiencing homelessness, if federal financial
participation is available; requiring the development of a model for
providing such medical respite care; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Department of Health and Human Services to administer
2 Medicaid. (NRS 422.270) If federal financial participation is available, section 1 of this bill
3 requires the Director of the Department , effective July 1, 2027, to include coverage under
4 Medicaid for medical respite care provided to persons experiencing homelessness by a facility
5 that meets certain requirements. Section 1 requires the Department to apply to the Federal
6 Government for any waiver or amendment necessary to receive federal financial participation
7 to provide such coverage. Section 1 defines “medical respite care” to refer to certain medical
8 care and support services. Section 1 additionally requires the Division of Health Care
9 Financing and Policy of the Department to coordinate with the Division of Public and
10 Behavioral Health of the Department to develop a model for providing medical respite care to
11 persons experiencing homelessness. Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to
12 indicate that the provisions of section 1 will be administered in the same manner as the
13 provisions of existing law governing Medicaid.
