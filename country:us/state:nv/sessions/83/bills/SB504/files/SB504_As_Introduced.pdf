Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides that, beginning no later than July 1, 2025, courts retain
2 jurisdiction over certain young adults who are at least 18 years of age but less than
3 21 years of age and who have been placed outside the home in child welfare
4 proceedings. (NRS 432B.5917) Existing law requires the Division of Child and
5 Family Services of the Department of Health and Human Services to establish the
6 Extended Young Adult Support Services Program to provide extended youth
7 support services to such young adults, which must become operational on the
8 earlier of July 1, 2025, or the date on which there is sufficient money available to
-
*SB504*

– 2 –
9 carry out the Program. (NRS 432B.5919) Existing law defines the term “young
10 adult” for the purposes of the Program to mean a person who is at least 18 years of
11 age but less than 21 years of age and whose plan for permanent placement, on his
12 or her 18th birthday, did not provide for reunification with his or her parent. (NRS
13 432B.5915) Section 1 of this bill revises the definition of the term “young adult” to
14 instead refer to a person who: (1) on his or her 18th birthday, was subject to a court
15 order for placement in foster care or proceedings for which a possible outcome is
16 placement in foster care; or (2) exited the Kinship Guardianship Assistance
17 Program or an adoption assistance program after attaining 16 years of age and is
18 not currently receiving care from a guardian or adoptive parent. Section 1 thereby
19 provides that such a person remains under the jurisdiction of the court and is
20 eligible to participate in the Program.
21 Existing law requires a court to retain jurisdiction over a young adult until the
22 young adult reaches 21 years of age. (NRS 432B.5917) Section 2 of this bill
23 authorizes an agency which provides child welfare services to, under certain
24 circumstances, petition the court to dismiss its current jurisdiction over a young
25 adult and immediately reassume jurisdiction over the young adult to establish the
26 eligibility of the young adult for certain federal financial participation.
27 Once the Program becomes operational, existing law requires an agency which
28 provides child welfare services that has custody of a child to meet with the child at
29 least 120 days before his or her 18th birthday to determine whether the child wishes
30 to participate in the Program and, if the child does wish to participate, assist the
31 child to enroll in the Program. (NRS 432B.593) After the child requests to
32 participate in the Program, existing law requires the agency to develop and monitor
33 a written extended youth support services plan to assist the child in transitioning to
34 self-sufficiency. (NRS 432B.595) Sections 3-6 of this bill require a child who does
35 not wish to participate in the Program to affirmatively opt out of the Program, while
36 maintaining the existing eligibility requirements to participate in the Program.
37 Sections 5 and 6 revise the duties of an agency which provides child welfare
38 services with respect to a young adult who participates in the Program.
39 Existing law requires a court that has jurisdiction over a young adult who is
40 participating in the Program to hold an annual hearing to: (1) review the extended
41 youth support services plan developed for the young adult; and (2) determine
42 whether the agency which provides child welfare services has made reasonable
43 efforts to assist the young adult in meeting the goals prescribed in the plan. Existing
44 law authorizes the court to direct that the hearing be conducted by a panel of three
45 or more persons appointed by mutual consent of the judge or judges of the court.
46 (NRS 432B.601) Section 7 of this bill requires the court to hold such a hearing
47 every 6 months instead of annually. If the court directs a panel to conduct such a
48 hearing, section 7 requires that at least one member of the panel be a person who is
49 not responsible for the case management of or delivery of services to the young
50 adult. Section 8 of this bill revises certain terminology and statutory references
51 related to the Program.

32 or neglected children if the court determines that the child:
