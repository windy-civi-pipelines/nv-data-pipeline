EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public employees; authorizing, under certain
circumstances, peace officers or firefighters in the
Executive Department of State Government to
collectively bargain for insurance benefits; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits collective bargaining between the Executive Department
2 of State Government and the exclusive representative of a bargaining unit for
3 insurance benefits. (NRS 288.500) This bill creates an exception to authorize the
4 Executive Department of State Government and the exclusive representative of a
5 bargaining unit that represents category I peace officers, category II peace officers,
6 category III peace officers, firefighters, supervisory employees who are category I
7 peace officers, supervisory employees who are category II peace officers,
8 supervisory employees who are category III peace officers or supervisory
9 employees who are firefighters to negotiate to leave the Public Employees’ Benefits
10 Program and obtain other life, accident or health insurance, or any combination
11 thereof. Existing law authorizes certain groups of state officers and employees to
12 leave the Program and obtain other life, accident or health insurance, or any
13 combination thereof, subject to the approval of the Board of the Public Employees’
14 Benefits Program. (NRS 287.0479) If such peace officers and firefighters negotiate
15 to leave the Program, this bill exempts such an action from the requirement to
16 obtain the approval of the Board.

1 Section 1. NRS 288.500 is hereby amended to read as follows:

6 collective bargaining and supplemental bargaining through
7 exclusive representatives and engage in other concerted activities;
8 and
9 (b) Refrain from engaging in such activity.
10 2. Collective bargaining and supplemental bargaining entail a
11 mutual obligation of the Executive Department and an exclusive
12 representative to meet at reasonable times and to bargain in good
13 faith with respect to:
14 (a) The subjects of mandatory bargaining set forth in subsection
15 2 of NRS 288.150, except paragraph (f) of that subsection;
16 (b) The negotiation of an agreement;
