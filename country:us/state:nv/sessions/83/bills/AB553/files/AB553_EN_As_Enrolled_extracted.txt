providing assistance to the Nevada Commission on Homeland Security and the

concerning crisis, disaster and emergency preparation and response and
administering the Nevada Intrastate Mutual Aid System. (Chapter 239C of NRS,

39 and 43 of this bill: (1) transfer the Division to the Office of the Governor; and
(2) rename the Division to the Office of Emergency Management. Sections 40 and
43 of this bill reorganize the duties of the Office to execute, administer and enforce

Nevada Intrastate Mutual Aid System. Section 40 also removes the duty of the
Office of the Military to supervise the emergency management affairs of this State.

Existing law requires the Adjutant General of the Office of the Military to
appoint the Chief of the Division and provides that the Chief must carry out the
program for emergency management in this State subject to the direction and
control of the Adjutant General. (NRS 414.040) Section 43 provides that the Chief
of the Office is appointed by, serves at the pleasure of and must carry out the
program of emergency management subject to the direction and control of the
Governor.
Existing law authorizes the Adjutant General to employ such persons in the
classified service of the State as the Adjutant General determines to be necessary to
carry out the duties of the Commission. (NRS 239C.175) Section 7 of this bill
authorizes the Chief of the Office to employ such persons to carry out the duties of
the Commission.
Existing law authorizes the Adjutant General to supervise and control certain
activities of the Chief of the Division, including administering the Nevada
Intrastate Mutual Aid System. (NRS 239C.400, 414A.100) Sections 12 and 53
instead authorize the Governor to supervise and control such activities.
Sections 3, 17, 41, 51 and 58 of this bill make conforming changes to define
the term “Office” to mean the Office of Emergency Management.
Section 4 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law and section 3 to
existing provisions governing homeland security.
Section 18 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law and section 17 to
existing provisions governing the Disaster Relief Account.
Section 52 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law and section 51 to
existing provisions governing the Nevada Intrastate Mutual Aid System.

effect immediately, without prior notice or comment, and is not a

similarly licensed practitioner in this State would not be allowed to
provide the services. A volunteer health practitioner has reason to
know of a limitation, modification or restriction or that a similarly
licensed practitioner in this State would not be allowed to provide a

modification or restriction exists or that a similarly licensed
practitioner in this State would not be allowed to provide the
service; or

a similarly licensed practitioner in this State would not be allowed to

pursuant to subsection 6, a licensing board or other disciplinary
authority shall consider the circumstances in which the conduct took
place, including, without limitation, any exigent circumstances and
the practitioner’s scope of practice, education, training, experience
and specialized skill.
