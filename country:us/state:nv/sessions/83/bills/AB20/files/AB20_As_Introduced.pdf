AN ACT relating to the Department of Motor Vehicles; authorizing
the imprinting of individualized symbols or codes for
different medical conditions on driver’s licenses or
identification cards; providing for the use of electronic
mail for certain communications concerning liability
insurance; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the Department of Motor Vehicles to adopt regulations
2 establishing a program for the imprinting of a symbol indicating a medical
3 condition on a driver’s license or identification card. If such a program is adopted,
4 existing law: (1) requires the Department to adopt a single symbol to indicate that a
5 person has a medical condition; and (2) prohibits the Department from adopting
6 individualized symbols for different medical conditions. (NRS 483.3485, 483.863)
7 Sections 1 and 2 of this bill authorize the Department to adopt individualized
8 symbols or codes for different medical conditions in addition to adopting the
9 required single symbol to indicate that a person has a medical condition.
10 Existing law requires the Department to mail to the registered owner of a motor
11 vehicle a request for information regarding the liability insurance covering the
12 motor vehicle, if the Department is unable to verify that the motor vehicle is
13 covered by a policy of liability insurance. If the Department does not receive the
14 requested information, existing law requires the Department to suspend the
15 registration of the motor vehicle after sending a notice of suspension of registration
16 by certified mail. (NRS 485.317) Section 3 of this bill additionally authorizes the
17 Department to send a request for information regarding liability insurance coverage
18 by electronic mail, if the registered owner has elected to receive information from
