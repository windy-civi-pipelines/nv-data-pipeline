SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to the Department of Motor Vehicles.
(BDR 43-305)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to the Department of Motor Vehicles; authorizing the imprinting
of individualized symbols or codes for different medical conditions on
driver’s licenses or identification cards; [providing for the use of
electronic mail for certain communications] revising the manner in
which the Department communicates certain information
concerning liability insurance; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the Department of Motor Vehicles to adopt regulations
2 establishing a program for the imprinting of a symbol indicating a medical condition on a
3 driver’s license or identification card. If such a program is adopted, existing law: (1) requires
4 the Department to adopt a single symbol to indicate that a person has a medical condition; and
5 (2) prohibits the Department from adopting individualized symbols for different medical
6 conditions. (NRS 483.3485, 483.863) Sections 1 and 2 of this bill authorize the Department
7 to adopt individualized symbols or codes for different medical conditions in addition to
8 adopting the required single symbol to indicate that a person has a medical condition.
9 Existing law requires the Department to mail to the registered owner of a motor vehicle a
10 request for information regarding the liability insurance covering the motor vehicle, if the
11 Department is unable to verify that the motor vehicle is covered by a policy of liability
12 insurance. If the Department does not receive the requested information, existing law requires
13 the Department to suspend the registration of the motor vehicle after sending a notice of
14 suspension of registration by certified mail. (NRS 485.317) Section 3 of this bill [additionally
15 authorizes] requires the Department to send a request for information regarding liability
16 insurance coverage by electronic [mail,] notification, if the registered owner has elected to
17 receive information from the Department by electronic [mail.] notification. Section 3 also
18 requires the Department to send a notice of suspension of registration by electronic [mail,]
19 notification, if the registered owner has elected to receive information from the Department
20 by electronic [mail,] notification, in addition to sending the notice by certified mail [.] or a
21 mail service that requires the signature of the recipient and confirmation of delivery.
