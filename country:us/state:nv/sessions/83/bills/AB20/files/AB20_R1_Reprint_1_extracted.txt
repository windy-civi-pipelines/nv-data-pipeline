the imprinting of individualized symbols or codes for
different medical conditions on driver’s licenses or
identification cards; revising the manner in which the

liability insurance; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the Department of Motor Vehicles to adopt regulations
2 establishing a program for the imprinting of a symbol indicating a medical
3 condition on a driver’s license or identification card. If such a program is adopted,
4 existing law: (1) requires the Department to adopt a single symbol to indicate that a
5 person has a medical condition; and (2) prohibits the Department from adopting
6 individualized symbols for different medical conditions. (NRS 483.3485, 483.863)
7 Sections 1 and 2 of this bill authorize the Department to adopt individualized
8 symbols or codes for different medical conditions in addition to adopting the
9 required single symbol to indicate that a person has a medical condition.
10 Existing law requires the Department to mail to the registered owner of a motor
11 vehicle a request for information regarding the liability insurance covering the
12 motor vehicle, if the Department is unable to verify that the motor vehicle is
13 covered by a policy of liability insurance. If the Department does not receive the
14 requested information, existing law requires the Department to suspend the
15 registration of the motor vehicle after sending a notice of suspension of registration
16 by certified mail. (NRS 485.317) Section 3 of this bill requires the Department to
17 send a request for information regarding liability insurance coverage by electronic
18 notification, if the registered owner has elected to receive information from the
-

– 2 –
19 Department by electronic notification. Section 3 also requires the Department to
20 send a notice of suspension of registration by electronic notification, if the
21 registered owner has elected to receive information from the Department by
22 electronic notification, in addition to sending the notice by certified mail or a mail
23 service that requires the signature of the recipient and confirmation of delivery.
