Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law authorizes the Department of Motor Vehicles to adopt regulations
establishing a program for the imprinting of a symbol indicating a medical
condition on a driver’s license or identification card. If such a program is adopted,
existing law: (1) requires the Department to adopt a single symbol to indicate that a
person has a medical condition; and (2) prohibits the Department from adopting
individualized symbols for different medical conditions. (NRS 483.3485, 483.863)

Section 2:
Sections 1 and 2 of this bill authorize the Department to adopt individualized
symbols or codes for different medical conditions in addition to adopting the
required single symbol to indicate that a person has a medical condition.
Existing law requires the Department to mail to the registered owner of a motor
vehicle a request for information regarding the liability insurance covering the
motor vehicle, if the Department is unable to verify that the motor vehicle is
covered by a policy of liability insurance. If the Department does not receive the
requested information, existing law requires the Department to suspend the
registration of the motor vehicle after sending a notice of suspension of registration
by certified mail. (NRS 485.317) Section 3 of this bill requires the Department to
send a request for information regarding liability insurance coverage by electronic
notification, if the registered owner has elected to receive information from the
Department by electronic notification. Section 3 also requires the Department to
send a notice of suspension of registration by electronic notification, if the
registered owner has elected to receive information from the Department by
electronic notification, in addition to sending the notice by certified mail or a mail
service that requires the signature of the recipient and confirmation of delivery.
