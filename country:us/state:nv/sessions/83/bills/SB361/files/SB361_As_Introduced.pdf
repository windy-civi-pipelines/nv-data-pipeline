Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the issuance of a search warrant to search a place or a
2 person for any property: (1) that is stolen or embezzled; (2) that is designed or
3 intended to be used or has been used as the means of committing a criminal
4 offense; or (3) when the property consists of any item or constitutes any evidence
5 which tends to show that a criminal offense has been committed or that a particular
6 person has committed a criminal offense. (NRS 179.035) Section 14 of this bill
7 prohibits, with certain exceptions, a governmental entity from obtaining certain
8 location information of an electronic device or unique identifier without a tracking
9 warrant under certain circumstances. Section 14 prohibits any location information
10 obtained in violation of the provisions of section 14, or evidence derived therefrom,
11 from being admitted in any administrative, civil, criminal or other proceeding in
12 this State except to prove a violation of section 14.
13 Section 15 of this bill authorizes a magistrate to grant a tracking warrant if a
14 complete application is supported by probable cause to believe that: (1) the person
15 who owns or who is using an electronic device or who is using a unique identifier is
16 committing, has committed or is about to commit an offense; and (2) the location
17 information sought to be collected by the tracking warrant will produce evidence of
18 the offense. Section 15 sets forth the requirements for an application for a tracking

19 warrant and for the extension of a tracking warrant. Section 15 requires the

21 extension to seal any such application, warrant or extension and sets forth the
22 circumstances under which such information may be disclosed.
23 Section 16 of this bill sets forth requirements for the contents of a tracking
24 warrant and authorizes the applicant to request that certain provisions be included
25 in the tracking warrant. Section 16 also: (1) establishes certain limitations on the
26 period for which a tracking warrant may authorize the collection of location
27 information; and (2) authorizes the magistrate to extend such periods in certain
28 circumstances.
29 Section 17 prohibits, with certain exceptions, any location information, or
30 evidence derived therefrom, from being received into evidence or otherwise
31 disclosed in court unless a copy of the tracking warrant, its application and any
32 location information collected pursuant to the tracking warrant is transmitted to
33 certain persons not less than 10 days before any trial, hearing or other proceeding.
34 Section 18 of this bill sets forth a procedure by which a person who is
35 aggrieved by an alleged unlawful search and seizure of his or her location
36 information may move a court for the suppression of its use as evidence.
37 Section 19 of this bill requires a magistrate who issued a tracking warrant to
38 serve certain persons with a notice containing certain information not later than 90
39 days after the date of expiration of the period of time, or any extension thereof, for
40 which the tracking warrant authorized the collection of location information.
41 Sections 19 and 20 of this bill make certain information confidential and set forth
42 the circumstances under which such information and documentation may be
43 disclosed.

1 3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a
2 public book or record shall not deny a request made pursuant to
3 subsection 1 to inspect or copy or receive a copy of a public book or
4 record on the basis that the requested public book or record contains
5 information that is confidential if the governmental entity can
6 redact, delete, conceal or separate, including, without limitation,
7 electronically, the confidential information from the information
8 included in the public book or record that is not otherwise
9 confidential.
10 4. If requested, a governmental entity shall provide a copy of a
11 public record in an electronic format by means of an electronic
12 medium. Nothing in this subsection requires a governmental entity
13 to provide a copy of a public record in an electronic format or by
14 means of an electronic medium if:
15 (a) The public record:
16 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
17 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
18 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by
19 means of an electronic medium would:
20 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
21 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential
22 and that cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from
23 information that is not otherwise confidential.
24 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who
25 has legal custody or control of a public record:
26 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the
27 medium that is requested because the officer, employee or agent has
28 already prepared or would prefer to provide the copy in a different
29 medium.
30 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon
31 request, prepare the copy of the public record and shall not require
32 the person who has requested the copy to prepare the copy himself
33 or herself.
