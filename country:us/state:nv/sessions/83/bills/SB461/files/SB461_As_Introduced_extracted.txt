Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the Office of Economic Development to approve
2 transferable tax credits and abatements or partial abatements of certain property
3 taxes, business taxes and sales and use taxes for certain businesses in certain
4 circumstances. (NRS 231.1555, 274.310, 274.320, 274.330, 360.750, 360.753,
5 360.754, 360.759, 360.889, 360.945) Sections 3 and 13-15 of this bill authorize a
6 person who intends to locate or expand a high-impact business in this State, which
7 is defined in section 3 as a business primarily engaged in electric battery
8 production, the production of clean energy and water technology, advanced
9 manufacturing or the manufacturing of aerospace systems, defense technologies,
10 national security solutions or certain advanced health care technology, to apply to
11 the Office for a partial deduction of certain property taxes, business taxes and sales
12 and use taxes. Section 3 authorizes the Office to approve an application for a partial
13 deduction if the Office makes certain determinations and establishes the method to
14 calculate the amount of the partial deduction based upon whether the applicant
15 meets certain criteria. Section 3 prohibits the Office from approving a partial
16 deduction that would allow a business to deduct: (1) more than 60 percent of the
17 total amount of taxes that would otherwise be due in any tax year or over the 10-
18 year period following the date on which the partial deduction becomes effective; or
19 (2) in combination with any partial abatement that the business might receive, more
20 than 90 percent of the total amount of taxes that would otherwise be due. Section 7
21 of this bill requires the Department of Taxation to investigate whether a person
22 meets the eligibility requirements for the partial deduction created by section 3
23 during the course of certain other investigations. Sections 3 and 9 of this bill
24 require a person, to be eligible for the partial deduction, to enter into an agreement
25 with the Office that contains certain provisions. Section 10 of this bill requires the
26 Office to provide certain notice and take action at a public meeting on an
27 application for the partial deduction created by section 3. If the Office approves a
28 partial deduction of sales and use tax pursuant to section 3, section 11 of this bill
29 requires the Office to issue to the business a document certifying the partial
30 deduction. Section 16 of this bill exempts the partial deduction created by section 3
31 from provisions excluding certain provisions of the Local School Support Tax Law
32 from being subject to abatements on taxation which the Office is authorized to
33 approve. Sections 22 and 30 of this bill add the partial deduction created by
34 section 3 to the list of economic development incentives for which the Office is
35 required to submit certain reports. Sections 26 and 27 of this bill provide that
36 businesses that receive the deduction created by section 3 are not eligible to receive
37 certain tax credits that are authorized under existing law for businesses that meet
38 criteria to be a qualified active low-income community business or impact qualified
39 active low-income community business.
40 To be eligible for certain partial abatements or transferable tax credits, existing
41 law requires the business of the applicant to offer primary jobs. (NRS 360.750,
42 360.889) Section 3 requires a business to offer primary jobs to be eligible for the
43 partial deduction created by that section. Section 2 of this bill defines the term
44 “primary job” for the purposes of such provisions to mean a permanent, full-time
-
*SB461*
– 3 –
45 position of employment at a physical location of a business in this State that is: (1)
46 a location that generates a certain percentage of its revenue from exports to
47 locations outside of this State; or (2) a business that operates in certain sectors of
48 the economy and manufactures, produces or sells certain goods or services that are
49 imported into this State in significant quantities and which closes gaps in supply
50 chains, promotes local production or reduces the outflow of capital from this State.
51 Section 18 of this bill similarly defines “primary jobs” for the purposes of certain
52 other programs administered by the Office, and section 20 of this bill makes this
53 definition applicable to such programs.
54 Section 4 of this bill requires a person who claims an abatement, partial
55 abatement or partial deduction to submit a quarterly report to the Department
56 containing certain information, including: (1) a certification that the person was
57 approved for and continues to meet the requirements for the abatement or
58 deduction; and (2) documentation to demonstrate the person’s continuing
59 compliance with those requirements. Section 4 also requires the person to remit
60 sales and use tax owed for the previous calendar quarter that was not previously
61 remitted.
62 Section 5 of this bill authorizes the Board of Economic Development to deny,
63 or approve for a lesser amount, an application for an abatement, partial abatement,
64 partial deduction or transferable tax credits if the Board determines that approving
65 the full amount applied for is not in the best interests of the State. Section 5 lists
66 certain factors that the Board may consider in determining whether granting the full
67 amount applied for is in the best interests of the State.
68 Existing law authorizes the Office to approve applications for partial
69 abatements of certain taxes and the issuance of transferable tax credits submitted by
70 the lead participant engaged in a qualified project with other participants for a
71 common purpose or business endeavor and which is located within the geographic
72 boundaries of a single project site, if the participants agree collectively to make a
73 total new capital investment in this State of at least $1 billion during the 10-year
74 period immediately following the approval of the application. (NRS 360.880-
75 360.896) Under existing law, the Office is prohibited from approving such
76 transferable tax credits for any fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2025. (NRS
77 360.892) Additionally, the provisions authorizing such partial abatements and
78 transferable tax credits expire on June 30, 2032. (Section 69 of chapter 2, Statutes
79 of Nevada 2015, 29th Special Session, at page 54) Section 12 of this bill authorizes
80 the Office to approve such transferable tax credits, not to exceed $7,600,000 per
81 fiscal year, in each fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2025. Section 34 of this
82 bill delays the expiration of those provisions until June 30, 2033.
83 Section 6 of this bill authorizes the Office to issue transferable tax credits to a
84 person who has undertaken a project for the location or expansion of a child care
85 facility in this State which may be applied to certain fees and taxes. Section 6 limits
86 the number of the transferable tax credits that may be authorized by the Office each
87 fiscal year to $12,000,000, except that: (1) any amount of transferable tax credits
88 not approved in the fiscal year of a biennium must be carried forward and used only
89 in the second fiscal year of the biennium; and (2) the Office may not approve
90 credits for a fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2045. Section 6 provides that
91 the amount of transferable tax credits issued to an applicant must be a percentage of
92 the amount of qualified expenditures by the applicant and not more than 60 percent
93 of such qualified expenditures. Section 6 requires the Office, before issuing a
94 certificate of transferable tax credits, to certify to the Department or the Nevada
95 Gaming Control Board, as applicable, that the amount of transferable tax credits
96 will be deducted from the maximum amount of certain transferable tax credits that
97 the Office is authorized to approve that fiscal year. Section 6 prohibits more than
98 one-fifth of the total tax credits issued to a person from being used by the person, or
99 a person to whom the tax credits were transferred, in a fiscal year and provides that
-
*SB461*
– 4 –
100 the tax credits expire after 5 years. Section 6 requires the Office to submit a report
101 to the Governor, the Legislature and the Joint Interim Standing Committee on
102 Revenue regarding the tax credit for child care facilities.
103 Existing law authorizes a person who intends to locate or expand a business in
104 this State to apply to the Office for a partial abatement of certain property taxes,
105 business taxes and sales and use taxes. (NRS 360.750) Section 8 of this bill
106 removes a prohibition on the approval of a partial abatement for an applicant who
107 intends to locate or expand a business but who has already received a partial
108 abatement for locating or expanding that business, thereby authorizing a business to
109 obtain a partial abatement for locating or expanding a business in this State multiple
110 times.
111 Section 19 of this bill requires the Office to establish and administer a program
112 to award grants to qualified entities to construct certain infrastructure projects or
113 rural housing projects and creates the Community Infrastructure Grant Program
114 Account, which must be used to award such grants. Section 19 provides
115 requirements for the administration of the money in the Account and requires the
116 Office to prioritize applications for grants for certain projects.
117 Existing law requires the Executive Director of the Office to develop a State
118 Plan for Economic Development. (NRS 231.053) Section 21 of this bill requires
119 the Executive Director to revise the State Plan at least biennially and revises the
120 information which the Executive Director is required to include in the State Plan.
121 Existing law authorizes the Office to provide an allocation, grant or loan of
122 money to defray the cost of an approved program of workforce recruitment,
123 assessment and training. Existing law requires such a program to include a
124 workforce diversity action plan. (NRS 231.1467, 231.1468) Section 23 of this bill
125 revises the requirements for an application for approval of such a program and an
126 application by a business to participate in such a program. Section 23 replaces the
127 requirement for such a program to include a workforce diversity action plan with a
128 requirement to include a workforce development action plan, and section 38 of this
129 bill repeals provisions providing for the contents of a workforce diversity action
130 plan. Section 25 of this bill replaces a reference to the workforce diversity action
131 plan with the workforce development action plan.
132 Section 28 of this bill requires the Department of Employment, Training and
133 Rehabilitation and the Office to jointly establish a program to provide
134 reimbursement for certain expenses related to enrollment in an undergraduate or
135 certificate program in a trade-related field provided by the Nevada System of
136 Higher Education to persons who successfully completed a program of career and
137 technical education provided by a school district in this State. Section 28 requires
138 such reimbursement to be repaid unless the recipient meets certain requirements,
139 including completion of the undergraduate or certificate program and satisfaction of
140 a requirement to work in a trade-related field in a rural county for at least 2 years.
141 Section 29 of this bill applies certain definitions in existing law governing the
142 Department to section 28.
143 Section 31 of this bill requires the State Board of Education, to the extent
144 money is made available by the Department of Employment, Training and
145 Rehabilitation and in collaboration with the Department and the Office of
146 Economic Development, to establish a program to provide stipends to employers
147 whose employees act as part-time teachers for programs of career and technical
148 education. Section 31 authorizes an employer that is approved for a stipend to
149 donate the stipend to the school district in which the employee teaches for costs
150 associated with the program of career and technical education. Section 31 requires
151 an employer that receives the stipend to provide the employee with the full
152 compensation and benefits the employee would receive if the employee was not
153 acting as a part-time teacher.

154 Existing law requires the board of trustees of a school district in a county
155 whose population is 100,000 or more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties) and
156 authorizes the board of trustees of a school district in a county whose population is
157 less than 100,000 to establish a program of career and technical education. (NRS
158 388.380) Section 32 of this bill requires the board of trustees of a school district
159 that offers a program of career and technical education to enter into talent pipeline
160 agreements with local businesses to facilitate the participation of pupils in
161 internships, apprenticeships and short-term career experiences. Section 32 requires
162 a talent pipeline agreement to include certain provisions. Sections 24 and 32 of this
163 bill require the Office to establish a program to award grants to school districts with
164 active talent pipeline agreements using funds from the Workforce Innovations for a
165 New Nevada Account. Section 32 requires a business which is party to an active
166 talent pipeline agreement to submit annually a report to the State Board and the
167 Office.
168 Section 32 revises the curriculum which is required to be provided through a
169 program of career and technical education.
170 Existing law authorizes the Office to approve a partial abatement from the taxes
171 imposed on real property for a business that: (1) engages in the primary trade of
172 preparing, fabricating, manufacturing or otherwise processing raw material or an
173 intermediate product using a certain percentage of recycled materials or includes as
174 a primary component a facility for the generation of electricity from recycled
175 material; and (2) has as its primary purpose the conservation of energy or the
176 substitution of other sources of energy for fossil fuel sources of energy. (NRS
177 701A.210) Section 33 of this bill authorizes the Office to grant such a partial
178 abatement of property taxes to a business that: (1) includes as a primary component
179 a facility for the production of biofuels, biomass or other primary fuels from
180 recycled material for use in the production of energy; or (2) primarily engages in
181 the recycling or repurposing of materials that were used to produce or store
182 renewable energy, including, without limitation, materials used in solar panels, or
183 waste materials resulting from the extraction of minerals.
184 Section 39 of this bill makes the provisions of sections 3, 13-15 and 33 expire
185 by limitation on June 30, 2045, to comply with the requirement of Article 10,
186 section 6 of the Nevada Constitution that the Legislature must provide an expiration
187 date for certain exemptions from taxes.

21 which includes provisions that are calculated to prevent any

governing programs of career and technical education;
authorizing businesses that recycle certain materials or
produce certain fuels from recycled materials to apply to
the Office for a partial abatement of certain taxes; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the Office of Economic Development to approve
2 transferable tax credits and abatements or partial abatements of certain property
3 taxes, business taxes and sales and use taxes for certain businesses in certain
4 circumstances. (NRS 231.1555, 274.310, 274.320, 274.330, 360.750, 360.753,
5 360.754, 360.759, 360.889, 360.945) Sections 3 and 13-15 of this bill authorize a
6 person who intends to locate or expand a high-impact business in this State, which
7 is defined in section 3 as a business primarily engaged in electric battery
8 production, the production of clean energy and water technology, advanced
9 manufacturing or the manufacturing of aerospace systems, defense technologies,
10 national security solutions or certain advanced health care technology, to apply to
11 the Office for a partial deduction of certain property taxes, business taxes and sales
12 and use taxes. Section 3 authorizes the Office to approve an application for a partial
13 deduction if the Office makes certain determinations and establishes the method to
14 calculate the amount of the partial deduction based upon whether the applicant
15 meets certain criteria. Section 3 prohibits the Office from approving a partial
16 deduction that would allow a business to deduct: (1) more than 60 percent of the
17 total amount of taxes that would otherwise be due in any tax year or over the 10-
18 year period following the date on which the partial deduction becomes effective; or
19 (2) in combination with any partial abatement that the business might receive, more
20 than 90 percent of the total amount of taxes that would otherwise be due. Section 7
21 of this bill requires the Department of Taxation to investigate whether a person
22 meets the eligibility requirements for the partial deduction created by section 3
23 during the course of certain other investigations. Sections 3 and 9 of this bill
24 require a person, to be eligible for the partial deduction, to enter into an agreement
25 with the Office that contains certain provisions. Section 10 of this bill requires the
26 Office to provide certain notice and take action at a public meeting on an
27 application for the partial deduction created by section 3. If the Office approves a
28 partial deduction of sales and use tax pursuant to section 3, section 11 of this bill
29 requires the Office to issue to the business a document certifying the partial
30 deduction. Section 16 of this bill exempts the partial deduction created by section 3
31 from provisions excluding certain provisions of the Local School Support Tax Law
32 from being subject to abatements on taxation which the Office is authorized to
33 approve. Sections 22 and 30 of this bill add the partial deduction created by
34 section 3 to the list of economic development incentives for which the Office is
35 required to submit certain reports. Sections 26 and 27 of this bill provide that
36 businesses that receive the deduction created by section 3 are not eligible to receive
37 certain tax credits that are authorized under existing law for businesses that meet
38 criteria to be a qualified active low-income community business or impact qualified
39 active low-income community business.
40 To be eligible for certain partial abatements or transferable tax credits, existing
41 law requires the business of the applicant to offer primary jobs. (NRS 360.750,
42 360.889) Section 3 requires a business to offer primary jobs to be eligible for the
43 partial deduction created by that section. Section 2 of this bill defines the term
44 “primary job” for the purposes of such provisions to mean a permanent, full-time
-
*SB461*

– 3 –
45 position of employment at a physical location of a business in this State that is: (1)
46 a location that generates a certain percentage of its revenue from exports to
47 locations outside of this State; or (2) a business that operates in certain sectors of
48 the economy and manufactures, produces or sells certain goods or services that are
49 imported into this State in significant quantities and which closes gaps in supply
50 chains, promotes local production or reduces the outflow of capital from this State.
51 Section 18 of this bill similarly defines “primary jobs” for the purposes of certain
52 other programs administered by the Office, and section 20 of this bill makes this
53 definition applicable to such programs.
54 Section 4 of this bill requires a person who claims an abatement, partial
55 abatement or partial deduction to submit a quarterly report to the Department
56 containing certain information, including: (1) a certification that the person was
57 approved for and continues to meet the requirements for the abatement or
58 deduction; and (2) documentation to demonstrate the person’s continuing
59 compliance with those requirements. Section 4 also requires the person to remit
60 sales and use tax owed for the previous calendar quarter that was not previously
61 remitted.
62 Section 5 of this bill authorizes the Board of Economic Development to deny,
63 or approve for a lesser amount, an application for an abatement, partial abatement,
64 partial deduction or transferable tax credits if the Board determines that approving
65 the full amount applied for is not in the best interests of the State. Section 5 lists
66 certain factors that the Board may consider in determining whether granting the full
67 amount applied for is in the best interests of the State.
68 Existing law authorizes the Office to approve applications for partial
69 abatements of certain taxes and the issuance of transferable tax credits submitted by
70 the lead participant engaged in a qualified project with other participants for a
71 common purpose or business endeavor and which is located within the geographic
72 boundaries of a single project site, if the participants agree collectively to make a
73 total new capital investment in this State of at least $1 billion during the 10-year
74 period immediately following the approval of the application. (NRS 360.880-
75 360.896) Under existing law, the Office is prohibited from approving such
76 transferable tax credits for any fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2025. (NRS
77 360.892) Additionally, the provisions authorizing such partial abatements and
78 transferable tax credits expire on June 30, 2032. (Section 69 of chapter 2, Statutes
79 of Nevada 2015, 29th Special Session, at page 54) Section 12 of this bill authorizes
80 the Office to approve such transferable tax credits, not to exceed $7,600,000 per
81 fiscal year, in each fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2025. Section 34 of this
82 bill delays the expiration of those provisions until June 30, 2033.
83 Section 6 of this bill authorizes the Office to issue transferable tax credits to a
84 person who has undertaken a project for the location or expansion of a child care
85 facility in this State which may be applied to certain fees and taxes. Section 6 limits
86 the number of the transferable tax credits that may be authorized by the Office each
87 fiscal year to $12,000,000, except that: (1) any amount of transferable tax credits
88 not approved in the fiscal year of a biennium must be carried forward and used only
89 in the second fiscal year of the biennium; and (2) the Office may not approve
90 credits for a fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2045. Section 6 provides that
91 the amount of transferable tax credits issued to an applicant must be a percentage of
92 the amount of qualified expenditures by the applicant and not more than 60 percent
93 of such qualified expenditures. Section 6 requires the Office, before issuing a
94 certificate of transferable tax credits, to certify to the Department or the Nevada
95 Gaming Control Board, as applicable, that the amount of transferable tax credits
96 will be deducted from the maximum amount of certain transferable tax credits that
97 the Office is authorized to approve that fiscal year. Section 6 prohibits more than
98 one-fifth of the total tax credits issued to a person from being used by the person, or
99 a person to whom the tax credits were transferred, in a fiscal year and provides that
-
*SB461*

– 4 –
100 the tax credits expire after 5 years. Section 6 requires the Office to submit a report
101 to the Governor, the Legislature and the Joint Interim Standing Committee on
102 Revenue regarding the tax credit for child care facilities.
103 Existing law authorizes a person who intends to locate or expand a business in
104 this State to apply to the Office for a partial abatement of certain property taxes,
105 business taxes and sales and use taxes. (NRS 360.750) Section 8 of this bill
106 removes a prohibition on the approval of a partial abatement for an applicant who
107 intends to locate or expand a business but who has already received a partial
108 abatement for locating or expanding that business, thereby authorizing a business to
109 obtain a partial abatement for locating or expanding a business in this State multiple
110 times.
111 Section 19 of this bill requires the Office to establish and administer a program
112 to award grants to qualified entities to construct certain infrastructure projects or
113 rural housing projects and creates the Community Infrastructure Grant Program
114 Account, which must be used to award such grants. Section 19 provides
115 requirements for the administration of the money in the Account and requires the
116 Office to prioritize applications for grants for certain projects.
117 Existing law requires the Executive Director of the Office to develop a State
118 Plan for Economic Development. (NRS 231.053) Section 21 of this bill requires
119 the Executive Director to revise the State Plan at least biennially and revises the
120 information which the Executive Director is required to include in the State Plan.
121 Existing law authorizes the Office to provide an allocation, grant or loan of
122 money to defray the cost of an approved program of workforce recruitment,
123 assessment and training. Existing law requires such a program to include a
124 workforce diversity action plan. (NRS 231.1467, 231.1468) Section 23 of this bill
125 revises the requirements for an application for approval of such a program and an
126 application by a business to participate in such a program. Section 23 replaces the
127 requirement for such a program to include a workforce diversity action plan with a
128 requirement to include a workforce development action plan, and section 38 of this
129 bill repeals provisions providing for the contents of a workforce diversity action
130 plan. Section 25 of this bill replaces a reference to the workforce diversity action
131 plan with the workforce development action plan.
132 Section 28 of this bill requires the Department of Employment, Training and
133 Rehabilitation and the Office to jointly establish a program to provide
134 reimbursement for certain expenses related to enrollment in an undergraduate or
135 certificate program in a trade-related field provided by the Nevada System of
136 Higher Education to persons who successfully completed a program of career and
137 technical education provided by a school district in this State. Section 28 requires
138 such reimbursement to be repaid unless the recipient meets certain requirements,
139 including completion of the undergraduate or certificate program and satisfaction of
140 a requirement to work in a trade-related field in a rural county for at least 2 years.
141 Section 29 of this bill applies certain definitions in existing law governing the
142 Department to section 28.
143 Section 31 of this bill requires the State Board of Education, to the extent
144 money is made available by the Department of Employment, Training and
145 Rehabilitation and in collaboration with the Department and the Office of
146 Economic Development, to establish a program to provide stipends to employers
147 whose employees act as part-time teachers for programs of career and technical
148 education. Section 31 authorizes an employer that is approved for a stipend to
149 donate the stipend to the school district in which the employee teaches for costs
150 associated with the program of career and technical education. Section 31 requires
151 an employer that receives the stipend to provide the employee with the full
152 compensation and benefits the employee would receive if the employee was not
153 acting as a part-time teacher.

154 Existing law requires the board of trustees of a school district in a county
155 whose population is 100,000 or more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties) and
156 authorizes the board of trustees of a school district in a county whose population is
157 less than 100,000 to establish a program of career and technical education. (NRS
158 388.380) Section 32 of this bill requires the board of trustees of a school district
159 that offers a program of career and technical education to enter into talent pipeline
160 agreements with local businesses to facilitate the participation of pupils in
161 internships, apprenticeships and short-term career experiences. Section 32 requires
162 a talent pipeline agreement to include certain provisions. Sections 24 and 32 of this
163 bill require the Office to establish a program to award grants to school districts with
164 active talent pipeline agreements using funds from the Workforce Innovations for a
165 New Nevada Account. Section 32 requires a business which is party to an active
166 talent pipeline agreement to submit annually a report to the State Board and the
167 Office.
168 Section 32 revises the curriculum which is required to be provided through a
169 program of career and technical education.
170 Existing law authorizes the Office to approve a partial abatement from the taxes
171 imposed on real property for a business that: (1) engages in the primary trade of
172 preparing, fabricating, manufacturing or otherwise processing raw material or an
173 intermediate product using a certain percentage of recycled materials or includes as
174 a primary component a facility for the generation of electricity from recycled
175 material; and (2) has as its primary purpose the conservation of energy or the
176 substitution of other sources of energy for fossil fuel sources of energy. (NRS
177 701A.210) Section 33 of this bill authorizes the Office to grant such a partial
178 abatement of property taxes to a business that: (1) includes as a primary component
179 a facility for the production of biofuels, biomass or other primary fuels from
180 recycled material for use in the production of energy; or (2) primarily engages in
181 the recycling or repurposing of materials that were used to produce or store
182 renewable energy, including, without limitation, materials used in solar panels, or
183 waste materials resulting from the extraction of minerals.
184 Section 39 of this bill makes the provisions of sections 3, 13-15 and 33 expire
185 by limitation on June 30, 2045, to comply with the requirement of Article 10,
186 section 6 of the Nevada Constitution that the Legislature must provide an expiration
187 date for certain exemptions from taxes.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

19 issued transferable tax credits pursuant to this section transfers
20 those credits, the transfer must be made pursuant to an agreement
21 which includes provisions that are calculated to prevent any
