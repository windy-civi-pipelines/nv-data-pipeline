AN ACT relating to law enforcement; requiring that a peace officer
compelled to appear as a witness in certain investigations
receive written notice within a certain time of the
obligation to appear for an interview; requiring that such
notice state certain matters with specificity; providing that
representatives chosen by a peace officer who is the
subject of or a witness in certain investigations are not
required to be in the same bargaining unit as the peace
officer; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes a law enforcement agency to conduct an investigation
2 of a peace officer in response to a complaint or allegation that the peace officer
3 engaged in activities which may result in punitive action. (NRS 289.057) If a law
4 enforcement agency initiates an investigation of a peace officer, existing law
5 requires that written notice be provided to the peace officer not later than 48 hours
6 before any interrogation or hearing and that the written notice include a summary of
7 the peace officer’s alleged misconduct. (NRS 289.060) Section 1 of this bill
8 requires that the written notice set forth with specificity all the alleged facts to be
9 addressed during the interrogation or hearing and the rule, regulation, policy,
10 procedure or other standard which the peace officer is alleged to have violated.
11 Existing law also requires that an investigating agency provide written notice
12 before compelling a peace officer to appear and be interviewed as a witness in
13 connection with an investigation. (NRS 289.060) Section 1 prohibits a law
14 enforcement agency from interviewing a peace officer as a witness on less than 48
15 hours’ written notice. Section 1 specifies that such notice must be provided not
16 later than 48 hours before the peace officer must appear and be interviewed.

17 Finally, existing law authorizes a peace officer who is the subject of or a
18 witness in an investigation conducted in response to a complaint or allegation of
19 misconduct to have two representatives present during an interrogation, hearing or
20 interview. (NRS 289.080) Section 2 of this bill provides that chosen representatives
21 are not required to be in the same bargaining unit as the peace officer.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 289.060 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 289.060 1. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, a
3 law enforcement agency shall, not later than 48 hours before any
4 interrogation or hearing is held relating to an investigation
5 conducted pursuant to NRS 289.057, provide a written notice to the
6 peace officer who is the subject of the investigation. If the law
7 enforcement agency believes that any other peace officer has any
8 knowledge of any fact relating to the complaint or allegation against
9 the peace officer who is the subject of the investigation, the law
10 enforcement agency shall , not later than 48 hours before the peace
11 officer must appear and be interviewed in connection with the
12 investigation conducted pursuant to NRS 289.057, provide a
13 written notice to the peace officer advising the peace officer that he
14 or she must appear and be interviewed as a witness in connection
15 with the investigation. Any peace officer who serves as a witness
16 during an interview must be allowed a reasonable opportunity to
17 arrange for the presence and assistance of a representative
18 authorized by NRS 289.080. Any peace officer specified in this
19 subsection may waive the notice required pursuant to this section.

3 3. The law enforcement agency shall:
4 (a) Interview or interrogate the peace officer during the peace

6 the peace officer’s work schedule to allow any time that is required
7 for the interview or interrogation to be deemed a part of the peace
8 officer’s regular working hours. Any such time must be calculated
9 based on the peace officer’s regular wages for his or her regularly

11 interrogated during his or her regular working hours or if his or her
12 work schedule is not revised pursuant to this paragraph and the law
13 enforcement agency notifies the peace officer to appear at a time
14 when he or she is off duty, the peace officer must be compensated
15 for appearing at the interview or interrogation based on the wages

22 answer questions related to the peace officer’s alleged misconduct;
23 and
24 (2) If the peace officer fails to provide such a statement or to
25 answer any such questions, the agency may charge the peace officer
26 with insubordination.
27 (c) Limit the scope of the questions during the interrogation or
28 hearing to the alleged misconduct of the peace officer who is the
29 subject of the investigation. If any evidence is discovered during the
30 course of an investigation or hearing which establishes or may
31 establish any other possible misconduct engaged in by the peace
32 officer, the law enforcement agency shall notify the peace officer of
33 that fact and shall not conduct any further interrogation of the peace
34 officer concerning the possible misconduct until a subsequent notice
35 of that evidence and possible misconduct is provided to the peace
36 officer pursuant to this chapter.

17 officer’s choosing present with the peace officer during an interview
18 relating to the investigation, including, without limitation, a lawyer,
19 a representative of a labor union or another peace officer. The
20 presence of the second representative must not create an undue
21 delay in either the scheduling or conducting of the interview. The
22 representatives chosen by the peace officer pursuant to this
23 subsection are not required to be in the same bargaining unit as
24 the peace officer.
25 3. A representative of a peace officer must assist the peace
26 officer during the interview, interrogation or hearing.

32 agency has concluded its initial questioning of the peace officer.
33 5. A representative must not otherwise be connected to, or the
34 subject of, the same investigation.
35 6. Any information that a representative obtains from the peace

2 the law enforcement agency may make a stenographic, digital or
3 magnetic record of the interview, interrogation or hearing. If the

5 officer’s request and expense provide a copy of the:
6 (a) Stenographic transcript of the proceedings; or
7 (b) Recording on the digital or magnetic tape.
8 9. After the conclusion of the investigation, if a law
9 enforcement agency intends to recommend that punitive action be
10 imposed against the peace officer who was the subject of the
11 investigation, the law enforcement agency must notify the peace
12 officer of such fact and give the peace officer or any representative
13 of the peace officer a reasonable opportunity to inspect any evidence
14 in the possession of the law enforcement agency and submit a
15 response. The law enforcement agency must consider any such
16 response before making a recommendation to impose punitive
17 action against the peace officer. If the law enforcement agency
18 recommends punitive action be imposed against the peace officer
19 and the peace officer appeals the recommendation to impose
20 punitive action, the peace officer or any representative of the peace
21 officer may review and copy the entire file concerning the internal
22 investigation, including, without limitation, any evidence,
23 recordings, notes, transcripts of interviews and documents contained
