CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to law enforcement; requiring that a peace officer
compelled to appear as a witness in certain investigations
receive written notice within a certain time of the obligation
to appear for an interview; requiring that a peace officer
compelled to appear as the subject of an investigation receive
written notice that states certain matters with specificity; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law authorizes a law enforcement agency to conduct an investigation
of a peace officer in response to a complaint or allegation that the peace officer
engaged in activities which may result in punitive action. (NRS 289.057) If a law
enforcement agency initiates an investigation of a peace officer, existing law
requires that written notice be provided to the peace officer not later than 48 hours
before any interrogation or hearing and that the written notice include a summary of
the peace officer’s alleged misconduct. (NRS 289.060) Section 1 of this bill
requires that the written notice include a summary that sets forth with specificity
the alleged acts or omissions constituting the misconduct and the date, time and
location of the alleged misconduct. If the date, time or location is unknown, the
summary must specify that the date, time or location is unknown. Existing law also
requires that an investigating agency provide written notice before compelling a
peace officer to appear and be interviewed as a witness in connection with an
investigation. (NRS 289.060) Section 1 prohibits a law enforcement agency from
interviewing a peace officer as a witness on less than 48 hours’ written notice.

Section 2:
Section 1 specifies that such notice must be provided not later than 48 hours before
the peace officer must appear and be interviewed.
