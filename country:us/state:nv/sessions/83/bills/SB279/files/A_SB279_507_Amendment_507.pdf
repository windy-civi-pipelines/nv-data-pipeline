EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to law enforcement; requiring that a peace officer compelled to
appear as a witness in certain investigations receive written notice
within a certain time of the obligation to appear for an interview;
requiring that [such notice state] a peace officer compelled to appear
as the subject of an investigation receive written notice that states
certain matters with specificity; [providing that representatives chosen
by a peace officer who is the subject of or a witness in certain
investigations are not required to be in the same bargaining unit as the
peace officer;] and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes a law enforcement agency to conduct an investigation of a peace
2 officer in response to a complaint or allegation that the peace officer engaged in activities
3 which may result in punitive action. (NRS 289.057) If a law enforcement agency initiates an
4 investigation of a peace officer, existing law requires that written notice be provided to the
5 peace officer not later than 48 hours before any interrogation or hearing and that the written
6 notice include a summary of the peace officer’s alleged misconduct. (NRS 289.060) Section 1
7 of this bill requires that the written notice [set] include a summary that sets forth with
8 specificity [all] the alleged [facts to be addressed during the interrogation or hearing and the
9 rule, regulation, policy, procedure or other standard which the peace officer is alleged to have
10 violated.] acts or omissions constituting the misconduct and the date, time and location of
11 the alleged misconduct. If the date, time or location is unknown, the summary must
12 specify that the date, time or location is unknown. Existing law also requires that an
13 investigating agency provide written notice before compelling a peace officer to appear and be
14 interviewed as a witness in connection with an investigation. (NRS 289.060) Section 1
15 prohibits a law enforcement agency from interviewing a peace officer as a witness on less
16 than 48 hours’ written notice. Section 1 specifies that such notice must be provided not later
17 than 48 hours before the peace officer must appear and be interviewed.
18 [Finally, existing law authorizes a peace officer who is the subject of or a witness in an
19 investigation conducted in response to a complaint or allegation of misconduct to have two
20 representatives present during an interrogation, hearing or interview. (NRS 289.080) Section 2
21 of this bill provides that chosen representatives are not required to be in the same bargaining
22 unit as the peace officer.]

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 289.060 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 289.060 1. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, a law
3 enforcement agency shall, not later than 48 hours before any interrogation or
4 hearing is held relating to an investigation conducted pursuant to NRS 289.057,
5 provide a written notice to the peace officer who is the subject of the investigation.
6 If the law enforcement agency believes that any other peace officer has any
7 knowledge of any fact relating to the complaint or allegation against the peace
8 officer who is the subject of the investigation, the law enforcement agency shall ,
9 not later than 48 hours before the peace officer must appear and be interviewed
10 in connection with the investigation conducted pursuant to NRS 289.057, provide
11 a written notice to the peace officer advising the peace officer that he or she must
12 appear and be interviewed as a witness in connection with the investigation. Any
13 peace officer who serves as a witness during an interview must be allowed a
14 reasonable opportunity to arrange for the presence and assistance of a
15 representative authorized by NRS 289.080. Any peace officer specified in this
16 subsection may waive the notice required pursuant to this section.
17 2. The notice provided to the peace officer who is the subject of the
18 investigation must include:
19 (a) A description of the nature of the investigation . [;]
20 (b) A summary of alleged misconduct of the peace officer [;] setting forth with
21 specificity [:
22 (1) All facts to be addressed during the interrogation or hearing,
23 including, without limitation,] the alleged acts or omissions constituting the
24 misconduct and the date , [and] time and location of the alleged misconduct . [;
25 and
26 (2) The rule, regulation, policy, procedure or other standard which the
27 peace officer is alleged to have violated.] If the date, time or location of the
28 alleged misconduct is unknown, the summary must specify that the date, time or
29 location is unknown. If there are multiple allegations of misconduct, the
30 summary must describe each allegation of misconduct.
31 (c) The date, time and place of the interrogation or hearing . [;]
32 (d) The name and rank of the officer in charge of the investigation and the
33 officers who will conduct any interrogation or hearing . [;]
34 (e) The name of any other person who will be present at any interrogation or
35 hearing . [; and]
36 (f) A statement setting forth the provisions of subsection 1 of NRS 289.080.
37 3. The law enforcement agency shall:
38 (a) Interview or interrogate the peace officer during the peace officer’s regular
39 working hours, if reasonably practicable, or revise the peace officer’s work
40 schedule to allow any time that is required for the interview or interrogation to be
41 deemed a part of the peace officer’s regular working hours. Any such time must be
42 calculated based on the peace officer’s regular wages for his or her regularly
43 scheduled working hours. If the peace officer is not interviewed or interrogated
44 during his or her regular working hours or if his or her work schedule is not revised
45 pursuant to this paragraph and the law enforcement agency notifies the peace
46 officer to appear at a time when he or she is off duty, the peace officer must be
47 compensated for appearing at the interview or interrogation based on the wages and
48 any other benefits the peace officer is entitled to receive for appearing at the time
49 set forth in the notice.

2 officer who is the subject of the investigation orally on the record that:
3 (1) The peace officer is required to provide a statement and answer

6 such questions, the agency may charge the peace officer with insubordination.
7 (c) Limit the scope of the questions during the interrogation or hearing to the
8 alleged misconduct of the peace officer who is the subject of the investigation. If
9 any evidence is discovered during the course of an investigation or hearing which

11 officer, the law enforcement agency shall notify the peace officer of that fact and
12 shall not conduct any further interrogation of the peace officer concerning the
13 possible misconduct until a subsequent notice of that evidence and possible
14 misconduct is provided to the peace officer pursuant to this chapter.
15 (d) Allow the peace officer who is the subject of the investigation or who is a

20 pursuant to NRS 289.057 after the peace officer is informed that failing to provide
21 the statement or answer may result in punitive action against him or her, the
22 statement or answer must not be used against the peace officer who provided the
23 statement or answer in any subsequent criminal proceeding.
24 Sec. 2. [NRS 289.080 is hereby amended to read as follows:
25 289.080 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 5, a peace officer

35 have two representatives of the peace officer’s choosing present with the peace
36 officer during an interview relating to the investigation, including, without
37 limitation, a lawyer, a representative of a labor union or another peace officer. The
38 presence of the second representative must not create an undue delay in either the
39 scheduling or conducting of the interview. The representatives chosen by the peace
40 officer pursuant to this subsection are not required to be in the same bargaining
41 unit as the peace officer.
42 3. A representative of a peace officer must assist the peace officer during the
43 interview, interrogation or hearing.

1 7. Any information that a representative obtains from the peace officer who is
2 the subject of the investigation is confidential and must not be disclosed except
3 upon the:
4 (a) Request of the peace officer; or

6  A law enforcement agency shall not take punitive action against a representative
7 for the representative’s failure or refusal to disclose such information.
8 8. The peace officer, any representative of the peace officer or the law
9 enforcement agency may make a stenographic, digital or magnetic record of the
10 interview, interrogation or hearing. If the agency records the proceedings, the

12 (a) Stenographic transcript of the proceedings; or
13 (b) Recording on the digital or magnetic tape.
14 9. After the conclusion of the investigation, if a law enforcement agency
15 intends to recommend that punitive action be imposed against the peace officer who
16 was the subject of the investigation, the law enforcement agency must notify the
17 peace officer of such fact and give the peace officer or any representative of the
18 peace officer a reasonable opportunity to inspect any evidence in the possession of
19 the law enforcement agency and submit a response. The law enforcement agency
20 must consider any such response before making a recommendation to impose
21 punitive action against the peace officer. If the law enforcement agency
22 recommends punitive action be imposed against the peace officer and the peace
23 officer appeals the recommendation to impose punitive action, the peace officer or
24 any representative of the peace officer may review and copy the entire file
25 concerning the internal investigation, including, without limitation, any evidence,
26 recordings, notes, transcripts of interviews and documents contained in the file.]
