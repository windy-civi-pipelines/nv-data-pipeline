EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to law enforcement; requiring that a peace officer
compelled to appear as a witness in certain investigations
receive written notice within a certain time of the
obligation to appear for an interview; requiring that a
peace officer compelled to appear as the subject of an
investigation receive written notice that states certain
matters with specificity; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes a law enforcement agency to conduct an investigation
2 of a peace officer in response to a complaint or allegation that the peace officer
3 engaged in activities which may result in punitive action. (NRS 289.057) If a law
4 enforcement agency initiates an investigation of a peace officer, existing law
5 requires that written notice be provided to the peace officer not later than 48 hours
6 before any interrogation or hearing and that the written notice include a summary of
7 the peace officer’s alleged misconduct. (NRS 289.060) Section 1 of this bill
8 requires that the written notice include a summary that sets forth with specificity
9 the alleged acts or omissions constituting the misconduct and the date, time and
10 location of the alleged misconduct. If the date, time or location is unknown, the
11 summary must specify that the date, time or location is unknown. Existing law also
12 requires that an investigating agency provide written notice before compelling a
13 peace officer to appear and be interviewed as a witness in connection with an
14 investigation. (NRS 289.060) Section 1 prohibits a law enforcement agency from
15 interviewing a peace officer as a witness on less than 48 hours’ written notice.
16 Section 1 specifies that such notice must be provided not later than 48 hours before
17 the peace officer must appear and be interviewed.

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 289.060 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 289.060 1. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, a
3 law enforcement agency shall, not later than 48 hours before any
4 interrogation or hearing is held relating to an investigation
5 conducted pursuant to NRS 289.057, provide a written notice to the
6 peace officer who is the subject of the investigation. If the law
7 enforcement agency believes that any other peace officer has any
8 knowledge of any fact relating to the complaint or allegation against
9 the peace officer who is the subject of the investigation, the law
10 enforcement agency shall , not later than 48 hours before the peace
11 officer must appear and be interviewed in connection with the
12 investigation conducted pursuant to NRS 289.057, provide a
13 written notice to the peace officer advising the peace officer that he
14 or she must appear and be interviewed as a witness in connection
15 with the investigation. Any peace officer who serves as a witness
16 during an interview must be allowed a reasonable opportunity to

18 authorized by NRS 289.080. Any peace officer specified in this
19 subsection may waive the notice required pursuant to this section.

1 for the interview or interrogation to be deemed a part of the peace
2 officer’s regular working hours. Any such time must be calculated
3 based on the peace officer’s regular wages for his or her regularly
4 scheduled working hours. If the peace officer is not interviewed or
5 interrogated during his or her regular working hours or if his or her
6 work schedule is not revised pursuant to this paragraph and the law
7 enforcement agency notifies the peace officer to appear at a time
8 when he or she is off duty, the peace officer must be compensated
9 for appearing at the interview or interrogation based on the wages
10 and any other benefits the peace officer is entitled to receive for
11 appearing at the time set forth in the notice.
12 (b) Immediately before any interrogation or hearing begins,
13 inform the peace officer who is the subject of the investigation
14 orally on the record that:
15 (1) The peace officer is required to provide a statement and
16 answer questions related to the peace officer’s alleged misconduct;
17 and
18 (2) If the peace officer fails to provide such a statement or to
19 answer any such questions, the agency may charge the peace officer
20 with insubordination.
21 (c) Limit the scope of the questions during the interrogation or
22 hearing to the alleged misconduct of the peace officer who is the
23 subject of the investigation. If any evidence is discovered during the
24 course of an investigation or hearing which establishes or may
25 establish any other possible misconduct engaged in by the peace
26 officer, the law enforcement agency shall notify the peace officer of
27 that fact and shall not conduct any further interrogation of the peace
28 officer concerning the possible misconduct until a subsequent notice
29 of that evidence and possible misconduct is provided to the peace
30 officer pursuant to this chapter.
31 (d) Allow the peace officer who is the subject of the
32 investigation or who is a witness in the investigation to explain an
33 answer or refute a negative implication which results from
34 questioning during an interview, interrogation or hearing.
35 4. If a peace officer provides a statement or answers a question
36 relating to the alleged misconduct of a peace officer who is the
37 subject of an investigation pursuant to NRS 289.057 after the peace
38 officer is informed that failing to provide the statement or answer
39 may result in punitive action against him or her, the statement or
40 answer must not be used against the peace officer who provided the
41 statement or answer in any subsequent criminal proceeding.
