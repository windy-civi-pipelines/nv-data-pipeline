Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits a child who is less than 18 years of age from handling,
2 possessing or controlling a firearm under certain circumstances. (NRS 202.300)
3 Section 1 of this bill makes it a gross misdemeanor for a person who is less than 21
4 years of age to handle, possess or control a: (1) semiautomatic shotgun; or (2)
5 semiautomatic centerfire rifle.
6 Existing law provides that a person does not aid or knowingly permit a child to
7 handle, possess or control a firearm if the firearm was stored in a securely locked
8 container or at a location which a reasonable person would have believed to be
9 secure. Under existing law, a person who aids or knowingly permits a child to
10 handle, possess or control a firearm is guilty of: (1) for the first offense, a
11 misdemeanor; (2) for a first offense, if the person knows or has reason to know that
12 there is a substantial risk that the child will use the firearm to commit a violent act,
13 a category C felony; and (3) for a second or any subsequent offense, a category B
14 felony punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for a minimum term of not
15 less than 1 year and a maximum term of not more than 6 years. (NRS 202.300)

16 Section 1: (1) provides the same penalties for a person who aids or knowingly
17 permits a person who is less than 21 years of age to handle, possess or control
18 certain firearms; and (2) includes similar provisions concerning the circumstances
19 in which a person does not aid or knowingly permit a person who is less than 21
20 years of age to handle, possess or control such firearms.
21 Existing law makes it a misdemeanor for a person to negligently store or leave
22 a firearm at a location under his or her control if the person knows or has reason to
23 know that there is a substantial risk that a child, who is otherwise prohibited from
24 handling, possessing or controlling a firearm, may obtain the firearm. (NRS
25 202.300) Section 1 adds a similar provision imposing the same penalty for a person
26 who negligently stores or leaves a firearm at a similar location from which a person
27 who is less than 21 years of age may obtain the firearm.
28 Existing law authorizes a child who is 14 years of age or older and who, among
29 other requirements, has a valid hunting license, to handle, possess or control a: (1)
30 rifle or shotgun; or (2) firearm capable of being concealed upon the person.
31 However, existing law provides that the rifle or shotgun must not be a fully
32 automatic firearm. (NRS 202.300) Section 3 of this bill prohibits a child who is 14
33 years of age or older from handling, possessing or controlling a semiautomatic
34 shotgun or semiautomatic centerfire rifle.
35 Under certain circumstances, existing law authorizes a child who is 14 years of
36 age or older to handle, possess or control a rifle or shotgun that is not a fully
37 automatic firearm at his or her residence. (NRS 202.300) Section 3: (1) provides
38 that the rifle or shotgun must not be a semiautomatic shotgun or semiautomatic
39 centerfire rifle; and (2) requires that the rifle or shotgun, while not in use, must
40 remain unloaded and stored in a securely locked container under the possession of
41 certain persons.
42 Existing law provides that a person who barters or sells a pistol, revolver or
43 firearm capable of being concealed to a child who is less than 18 years of age, with
44 reckless disregard of the age of the child or with knowledge or reason to know that
45 the child is less than 18 years of age, is guilty of a category B felony punishable by
46 imprisonment in the state prison for a minimum term of not less than 1 year and a
47 maximum term of not more than 6 years, and may be further punished by a fine of
48 not more than $5,000. (NRS 202.310) Section 3.5 of this bill provides that a person
49 who sells or barters a semiautomatic centerfire rifle or semiautomatic shotgun to a
50 person who is less than 21 years of age, with reckless disregard of the age of the
51 person or with knowledge or reason to know that the person is less than 21 years of
52 age, is guilty of a category B felony and is subject to the same penalties.
53 Section 2 of this bill applies certain definitions prescribed by existing law to
54 section 1.
