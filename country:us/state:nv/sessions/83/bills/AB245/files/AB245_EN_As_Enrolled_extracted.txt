Section 2:
Section 1 of this bill makes it a gross misdemeanor for a person who is less than 21
years of age to handle, possess or control a: (1) semiautomatic shotgun; or (2)
semiautomatic centerfire rifle.
Existing law provides that a person does not aid or knowingly permit a child to
handle, possess or control a firearm if the firearm was stored in a securely locked
container or at a location which a reasonable person would have believed to be
secure. Under existing law, a person who aids or knowingly permits a child to
handle, possess or control a firearm is guilty of: (1) for the first offense, a
misdemeanor; (2) for a first offense, if the person knows or has reason to know that
there is a substantial risk that the child will use the firearm to commit a violent act,
a category C felony; and (3) for a second or any subsequent offense, a category B

years of age to handle, possess or control such firearms.
Existing law makes it a misdemeanor for a person to negligently store or leave

know that there is a substantial risk that a child, who is otherwise prohibited from
handling, possessing or controlling a firearm, may obtain the firearm. (NRS

Section 4:
202.300) Section 1 adds a similar provision imposing the same penalty for a person
who negligently stores or leaves a firearm at a similar location from which a person
who is less than 21 years of age may obtain the firearm.
Existing law authorizes a child who is 14 years of age or older and who, among
other requirements, has a valid hunting license, to handle, possess or control a: (1)
rifle or shotgun; or (2) firearm capable of being concealed upon the person.
However, existing law provides that the rifle or shotgun must not be a fully
automatic firearm. (NRS 202.300) Section 3 of this bill prohibits a child who is 14
years of age or older from handling, possessing or controlling a semiautomatic
shotgun or semiautomatic centerfire rifle.
Under certain circumstances, existing law authorizes a child who is 14 years of
age or older to handle, possess or control a rifle or shotgun that is not a fully

CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to firearms; prohibiting a person who is less than
21 years of age from possessing certain firearms; making it
unlawful to aid or knowingly permit a person who is less than

firearms to a person who is less than 21 years of age; revising
provisions relating to the storage of a firearm; revising
provisions relating to the handling, possession or control of a
firearm by certain children; providing penalties; and

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law prohibits a child who is less than 18 years of age from handling,

Section 1 of this bill makes it a gross misdemeanor for a person who is less than 21
years of age to handle, possess or control a: (1) semiautomatic shotgun; or (2)
semiautomatic centerfire rifle.
Existing law provides that a person does not aid or knowingly permit a child to
handle, possess or control a firearm if the firearm was stored in a securely locked
container or at a location which a reasonable person would have believed to be
secure. Under existing law, a person who aids or knowingly permits a child to
handle, possess or control a firearm is guilty of: (1) for the first offense, a
misdemeanor; (2) for a first offense, if the person knows or has reason to know that
there is a substantial risk that the child will use the firearm to commit a violent act,
a category C felony; and (3) for a second or any subsequent offense, a category B
felony punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for a minimum term of not
less than 1 year and a maximum term of not more than 6 years. (NRS 202.300)
Section 1: (1) provides the same penalties for a person who aids or knowingly
permits a person who is less than 21 years of age to handle, possess or control
certain firearms; and (2) includes similar provisions concerning the circumstances
in which a person does not aid or knowingly permit a person who is less than 21
years of age to handle, possess or control such firearms.
Existing law makes it a misdemeanor for a person to negligently store or leave
a firearm at a location under his or her control if the person knows or has reason to
know that there is a substantial risk that a child, who is otherwise prohibited from
handling, possessing or controlling a firearm, may obtain the firearm. (NRS
202.300) Section 1 adds a similar provision imposing the same penalty for a person
who negligently stores or leaves a firearm at a similar location from which a person
who is less than 21 years of age may obtain the firearm.
Existing law authorizes a child who is 14 years of age or older and who, among
other requirements, has a valid hunting license, to handle, possess or control a: (1)
rifle or shotgun; or (2) firearm capable of being concealed upon the person.
However, existing law provides that the rifle or shotgun must not be a fully
automatic firearm. (NRS 202.300) Section 3 of this bill prohibits a child who is 14
years of age or older from handling, possessing or controlling a semiautomatic
shotgun or semiautomatic centerfire rifle.
Under certain circumstances, existing law authorizes a child who is 14 years of
age or older to handle, possess or control a rifle or shotgun that is not a fully
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 2 –
automatic firearm at his or her residence. (NRS 202.300) Section 3: (1) provides
that the rifle or shotgun must not be a semiautomatic shotgun or semiautomatic
centerfire rifle; and (2) requires that the rifle or shotgun, while not in use, must
remain unloaded and stored in a securely locked container under the possession of
certain persons.
Existing law provides that a person who barters or sells a pistol, revolver or
firearm capable of being concealed to a child who is less than 18 years of age, with
reckless disregard of the age of the child or with knowledge or reason to know that
the child is less than 18 years of age, is guilty of a category B felony punishable by
imprisonment in the state prison for a minimum term of not less than 1 year and a
maximum term of not more than 6 years, and may be further punished by a fine of
not more than $5,000. (NRS 202.310) Section 3.5 of this bill provides that a person
who sells or barters a semiautomatic centerfire rifle or semiautomatic shotgun to a
person who is less than 21 years of age, with reckless disregard of the age of the
person or with knowledge or reason to know that the person is less than 21 years of
age, is guilty of a category B felony and is subject to the same penalties.
