5 semiautomatic centerfire rifle.
6 Existing law provides that a person does not aid or knowingly permit a child to
7 handle, possess or control a firearm if the firearm was stored in a securely locked
8 container or at a location which a reasonable person would have believed to be
9 secure. Under existing law, a person who aids or knowingly permits a child to
10 handle, possess or control a firearm is guilty of: (1) for the first offense, a
11 misdemeanor; (2) for a first offense, if the person knows or has reason to know that

20 years of age to handle, possess or control such firearms.
21 Existing law makes it a misdemeanor for a person to negligently store or leave
22 a firearm at a location under his or her control if the person knows or has reason to
23 know that there is a substantial risk that a child, who is otherwise prohibited from
24 handling, possessing or controlling a firearm, may obtain the firearm. (NRS
25 202.300) Section 1 adds a similar provision imposing the same penalty for a person
26 who negligently stores or leaves a firearm at a similar location from which a person
27 who is less than 21 years of age may obtain the firearm.
28 Existing law authorizes a child who is 14 years of age or older and who, among
29 other requirements, has a valid hunting license, to handle, possess or control a: (1)
30 rifle or shotgun; or (2) firearm capable of being concealed upon the person.
31 However, existing law provides that the rifle or shotgun must not be a fully
32 automatic firearm. (NRS 202.300) Section 3 of this bill prohibits a child who is 14
33 years of age or older from handling, possessing or controlling a semiautomatic
34 shotgun or semiautomatic centerfire rifle.
35 Under certain circumstances, existing law authorizes a child who is 14 years of
36 age or older to handle, possess or control a rifle or shotgun that is not a fully
37 automatic firearm at his or her residence. (NRS 202.300) Section 3: (1) provides
38 that the rifle or shotgun must not be a semiautomatic shotgun or semiautomatic
39 centerfire rifle; and (2) requires that the rifle or shotgun, while not in use, must
40 remain unloaded and stored in a securely locked container under the possession of
