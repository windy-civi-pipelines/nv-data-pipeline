Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits a child [under the age of] who is less than 18 years of age from
2 handling, possessing or controlling a firearm under certain circumstances. (NRS 202.300)
3 Section 1 of this bill makes it a gross misdemeanor for a person who is less than 21 years of
4 age to handle, possess or control a: (1) semiautomatic shotgun; or (2) semiautomatic
5 centerfire rifle.
6 Existing law provides that a person does not aid or knowingly permit a child to handle,
7 possess or control a firearm if the firearm was stored in a securely locked container or at a
8 location which a reasonable person would have believed to be secure. Under existing law, a
9 person who aids or knowingly permits a child to handle, possess or control a firearm is guilty
10 of: (1) for the first offense, a misdemeanor; (2) for a first offense, if the person knows or has
11 reason to know that there is a substantial risk that the child will use the firearm to commit a
12 violent act, a category C felony; and (3) for a second or any subsequent offense, a category B
13 felony punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for a minimum term of not less than 1
14 year and a maximum term of not more than 6 years. (NRS 202.300) Section 1: (1) provides
15 the same penalties for a person who aids or knowingly permits a person who is less than 21
16 years of age to handle, possess or control certain firearms; and (2) includes similar provisions
17 concerning the circumstances in which a person does not aid or knowingly permit a person
18 who is less than 21 years of age to handle, possess or control such firearms.
19 Existing law makes it a misdemeanor for a person to negligently store or leave a firearm
20 at a location under his or her control if the person knows or has reason to know that there is a
21 substantial risk that a child, who is otherwise prohibited from handling, possessing or
22 controlling a firearm, may obtain the firearm. (NRS 202.300) Section 1 adds a similar

Assembly Amendment No. 400 to Assembly Bill No. 245 Page 4
23 provision imposing the same penalty for a person who negligently stores or leaves a firearm at
24 a similar location from which a person who is less than 21 years of age may obtain the
25 firearm.
26 Existing law authorizes a child who is 14 years of age or older and who, among other
27 requirements, has a valid hunting license, to handle, possess or control a: (1) rifle or shotgun;
28 or (2) firearm capable of being concealed upon the person. However, existing law provides
29 that the rifle or shotgun must not be a fully automatic firearm. (NRS 202.300) Section 3 of
30 this bill prohibits a child who is 14 years of age or older from handling, possessing or
31 controlling a semiautomatic shotgun or semiautomatic centerfire rifle.
32 Under certain circumstances, existing law authorizes a child who is 14 years of age or
33 older to handle, possess or control a rifle or shotgun that is not a fully automatic firearm at his
34 or her residence. (NRS 202.300) Section 3: (1) provides that the rifle or shotgun must not be a
35 semiautomatic shotgun or semiautomatic centerfire rifle; and (2) requires that the rifle or
36 shotgun, while not in use, must remain unloaded and stored in a securely locked container
37 under the possession of certain persons.
38 Existing law provides that a person who barters or sells a pistol, revolver or firearm
39 capable of being concealed to a child who is less than 18 years of age, with reckless
40 disregard of the age of the child or with knowledge or reason to know that the child is
41 less than 18 years of age, is guilty of a category B felony punishable by imprisonment in
42 the state prison for a minimum term of not less than 1 year and a maximum term of not
43 more than 6 years, and may be further punished by a fine of not more than $5,000. (NRS
44 202.310) Section 3.5 of this bill provides that a person who sells or barters a
45 semiautomatic centerfire rifle or semiautomatic shotgun to a person who is less than 21
46 years of age, with reckless disregard of the age of the person or with knowledge or
47 reason to know that the person is less than 21 years of age, is guilty of a category B
48 felony and is subject to the same penalties.
49 Section 2 of this bill applies certain definitions prescribed by existing law to section 1.
