CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to local government employees; establishing
additional procedures pursuant to which parties to a
collective bargaining negotiation involving a school district
and an employee organization representing teachers may
submit issues to a binding arbitration process; prohibiting a
school district or any agent thereof from requiring, requesting
or urging a teacher to work more than a certain amount of
time under certain circumstances; revising the penalties that
may be imposed upon an employee organization representing
teachers, the officers thereof and teachers for participation in
a strike; revising the conduct that constitutes a strike; revising
provisions relating to the recognition of employee
organizations; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law sets forth various requirements and procedures for collective
bargaining between local government employers and local government employees.
(NRS 288.131-288.280) Existing law sets forth procedures by which the parties to a
negotiation involving a school district and an employee organization representing
teachers or educational support personnel, after having failed to reach a collective
bargaining agreement after at least four sessions of negotiations, may submit the
issues remaining in dispute to a binding arbitration process. (NRS 288.217)
Section 3 of this bill sets forth additional procedures by which the parties to a
negotiation involving a school district and an employee organization representing
teachers may submit issues remaining in dispute to a binding arbitration process.
Under section 3, the parties may, by mutual agreement, submit issues remaining in
dispute to the binding arbitration process set forth in section 3 if the collective
bargaining agreement between the school district and the employee organization
representing teachers: (1) is scheduled to expire within 75 days before the first day
of instruction of a school year and the parties have not agreed to a successor
agreement 75 days before the first day of instruction of the school year, in which
case the parties may submit the issues in dispute to an arbitrator any time on or
after the date that is 75 days before the first day of instruction of the school year
and on or before the date that is 30 days before the first day of instruction of the
school year; or (2) has expired, in which case the parties may submit the issues in
dispute to an arbitrator any time after the expiration of the agreement. Section 3
sets forth procedures for the selection of the arbitrator and procedures and
requirements for the arbitration process. Section 3 requires the arbitrator to render a
final decision, which is binding on the parties: (1) if the issues in dispute are
submitted to the binding arbitration process in accordance with the procedures for a
collective bargaining agreement which has expired, not later than 60 days after the
parties agreed to submit the issues in dispute to the binding arbitration process; or
(2) if the issues in dispute are submitted to the binding arbitration process in
accordance with the procedures for a collective bargaining agreement that is
scheduled to expire within 75 days before the first day of instruction of a school
year, not later than the first day of instruction of the school year. Section 12 of this
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 2 –
bill makes a conforming change to indicate that parties to a negotiation between a
school district and an employee organization representing teachers may utilize the
procedures set forth in section 3 under certain circumstances.
Section 4 of this bill provides that if a collective bargaining agreement between
a school district and an employee organization representing teachers has expired
and the terms of the agreement remain in effect under certain circumstances, the
school district or any agent thereof is prohibited from requesting, requiring or
urging a teacher to work more in any workday or workweek than the total amount
of time required by the expired agreement for each workday or workweek.
Existing law declares it to be the public policy of this State that strikes against
the State or a local government employer are illegal. (NRS 288.700) Existing law
requires a court that finds that such an illegal strike has occurred, or unless enjoined
will occur, to enjoin the commencement or continuance of the strike. (NRS
288.705) If a strike is commenced or continued in violation of an order enjoining
the strike, existing law authorizes a court to impose certain penalties against an
employee organization or labor organization guilty of such violation, any officer
thereof who is wholly or partly responsible of such violation or any employee of
the State or of a local government employer who participates in the strike. (NRS
288.710) Existing law also authorizes a State or local government employer to take
certain actions against an employee who participates in a strike, including,
dismissing, suspending or demoting the employee, canceling the contract of
employment for such an employee or withholding all or any part of the salary or
wages of the employee which would otherwise accrue. (NRS 288.715)
Sections 15 and 16 of this bill provide that the penalties that may be imposed
by a court and the actions that may be taken by a local government employer with
respect to a strike do not apply to a strike involving teachers or an employee
organization representing teachers. Instead, section 7 of this bill provides for the
imposition of penalties only on the employee organization and the officers of the
employee organization, and not an individual teacher, for an illegal strike.
Existing law defines “strike” to mean certain specified concerted conduct.
(NRS 288.074) Section 9 of this bill excludes from the definition of “strike” any of
the specified concerted conduct that is engaged in by teachers at one or more
schools in a school district unless the concerted conduct is engaged in on a district-
wide basis.
Existing law: (1) requires an employee organization that applies to a local
government employer for recognition to provide a pledge in writing not to strike
against the local government employer; and (2) authorizes a local government
employer to withdraw recognition from an employee organization that disavows
that pledge. (NRS 288.160) Section 11 of this bill excludes an employee
organization representing teachers from those provisions.
Sections 2 and 8 of this bill establish a definition for the term “teacher” for the
purposes of the provisions of existing law governing collective bargaining by
public employees.
Section 10 of this bill makes a conforming change to indicate the proper
placement of sections 3 and 4 in the Nevada Revised Statutes.

life of the contract being negotiated or arbitrated.
