Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth various requirements and procedures for collective
2 bargaining between local government employers and local government employees.
3 (NRS 288.131-288.280) Existing law sets forth procedures by which the parties to a
4 negotiation involving a school district and an employee organization representing
5 teachers or educational support personnel, after having failed to reach a collective
6 bargaining agreement after at least four sessions of negotiations, may submit the
7 issues remaining in dispute to a binding arbitration process. (NRS 288.217)
8 Section 3 of this bill sets forth additional procedures by which the parties to a
9 negotiation involving a school district and an employee organization representing
10 teachers may submit issues remaining in dispute to a binding arbitration process.
11 Under section 3, the parties may, by mutual agreement, submit issues remaining in
12 dispute to the binding arbitration process set forth in section 3 if the collective
-
*SB161_R1*
– 2 –
13 bargaining agreement between the school district and the employee organization
14 representing teachers: (1) is scheduled to expire within 75 days before the first day
15 of instruction of a school year and the parties have not agreed to a successor
16 agreement 75 days before the first day of instruction of the school year, in which
17 case the parties may submit the issues in dispute to an arbitrator any time on or
18 after the date that is 75 days before the first day of instruction of the school year
19 and on or before the date that is 30 days before the first day of instruction of the
20 school year; or (2) has expired, in which case the parties may submit the issues in
21 dispute to an arbitrator any time after the expiration of the agreement. Section 3
22 sets forth procedures for the selection of the arbitrator and procedures and
23 requirements for the arbitration process. Section 3 requires the arbitrator to render a
24 final decision, which is binding on the parties: (1) if the issues in dispute are
25 submitted to the binding arbitration process in accordance with the procedures for a
26 collective bargaining agreement which has expired, not later than 60 days after the
27 parties agreed to submit the issues in dispute to the binding arbitration process; or
28 (2) if the issues in dispute are submitted to the binding arbitration process in
29 accordance with the procedures for a collective bargaining agreement that is
30 scheduled to expire within 75 days before the first day of instruction of a school
31 year, not later than the first day of instruction of the school year. Section 12 of this
32 bill makes a conforming change to indicate that parties to a negotiation between a
33 school district and an employee organization representing teachers may utilize the
34 procedures set forth in section 3 under certain circumstances.
35 Section 4 of this bill provides that if a collective bargaining agreement between
36 a school district and an employee organization representing teachers has expired
37 and the terms of the agreement remain in effect under certain circumstances, the
38 school district or any agent thereof is prohibited from requesting, requiring or
39 urging a teacher to work more in any workday or workweek than the total amount
40 of time required by the expired agreement for each workday or workweek.
41 Existing law declares it to be the public policy of this State that strikes against
42 the State or a local government employer are illegal. (NRS 288.700) Existing law
43 requires a court that finds that such an illegal strike has occurred, or unless enjoined
44 will occur, to enjoin the commencement or continuance of the strike. (NRS
45 288.705) If a strike is commenced or continued in violation of an order enjoining
46 the strike, existing law authorizes a court to impose certain penalties against an
47 employee organization or labor organization guilty of such violation, any officer
48 thereof who is wholly or partly responsible of such violation or any employee of
49 the State or of a local government employer who participates in the strike. (NRS
50 288.710) Existing law also authorizes a State or local government employer to take
51 certain actions against an employee who participates in a strike, including,
52 dismissing, suspending or demoting the employee, canceling the contract of
53 employment for such an employee or withholding all or any part of the salary or
54 wages of the employee which would otherwise accrue. (NRS 288.715)
55 Sections 15 and 16 of this bill provide that the penalties that may be imposed
56 by a court and the actions that may be taken by a local government employer with
57 respect to a strike do not apply to a strike involving teachers or an employee
58 organization representing teachers. Instead, section 7 of this bill provides for the
59 imposition of penalties only on the employee organization and the officers of the
60 employee organization, and not an individual teacher, for an illegal strike.
61 Existing law defines “strike” to mean certain specified concerted conduct.
62 (NRS 288.074) Section 9 of this bill excludes from the definition of “strike” any of
63 the specified concerted conduct that is engaged in by teachers at one or more
64 schools in a school district unless the concerted conduct is engaged in on a district-
65 wide basis.
66 Existing law: (1) requires an employee organization that applies to a local
67 government employer for recognition to provide a pledge in writing not to strike
-
*SB161_R1*
– 3 –
68 against the local government employer; and (2) authorizes a local government
69 employer to withdraw recognition from an employee organization that disavows
70 that pledge. (NRS 288.160) Section 11 of this bill excludes an employee
71 organization representing teachers from those provisions.
72 Sections 2 and 8 of this bill establish a definition for the term “teacher” for the
73 purposes of the provisions of existing law governing collective bargaining by
74 public employees.
75 Section 10 of this bill makes a conforming change to indicate the proper
76 placement of sections 3 and 4 in the Nevada Revised Statutes.

FIRST REPRINT S.B. 161
SENATE BILL NO. 161–SENATOR NGUYEN
PREFILED FEBRUARY 3, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Government Affairs
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to local government
employees. (BDR 23-34)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to local government employees; establishing
additional procedures pursuant to which parties to a
collective bargaining negotiation involving a school
district and an employee organization representing
teachers may submit issues to a binding arbitration
process; prohibiting a school district or any agent thereof
from requiring, requesting or urging a teacher to work
more than a certain amount of time under certain
circumstances; revising the penalties that may be imposed
upon an employee organization representing teachers, the
officers thereof and teachers for participation in a strike;
revising the conduct that constitutes a strike; revising
provisions relating to the recognition of employee
organizations; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth various requirements and procedures for collective
2 bargaining between local government employers and local government employees.
3 (NRS 288.131-288.280) Existing law sets forth procedures by which the parties to a
4 negotiation involving a school district and an employee organization representing
5 teachers or educational support personnel, after having failed to reach a collective
6 bargaining agreement after at least four sessions of negotiations, may submit the
7 issues remaining in dispute to a binding arbitration process. (NRS 288.217)
8 Section 3 of this bill sets forth additional procedures by which the parties to a
9 negotiation involving a school district and an employee organization representing
10 teachers may submit issues remaining in dispute to a binding arbitration process.
11 Under section 3, the parties may, by mutual agreement, submit issues remaining in
12 dispute to the binding arbitration process set forth in section 3 if the collective
-
*SB161_R1*

– 2 –
13 bargaining agreement between the school district and the employee organization
14 representing teachers: (1) is scheduled to expire within 75 days before the first day
15 of instruction of a school year and the parties have not agreed to a successor
16 agreement 75 days before the first day of instruction of the school year, in which
17 case the parties may submit the issues in dispute to an arbitrator any time on or
18 after the date that is 75 days before the first day of instruction of the school year
19 and on or before the date that is 30 days before the first day of instruction of the
20 school year; or (2) has expired, in which case the parties may submit the issues in
21 dispute to an arbitrator any time after the expiration of the agreement. Section 3
22 sets forth procedures for the selection of the arbitrator and procedures and
23 requirements for the arbitration process. Section 3 requires the arbitrator to render a
24 final decision, which is binding on the parties: (1) if the issues in dispute are
25 submitted to the binding arbitration process in accordance with the procedures for a
26 collective bargaining agreement which has expired, not later than 60 days after the
27 parties agreed to submit the issues in dispute to the binding arbitration process; or
28 (2) if the issues in dispute are submitted to the binding arbitration process in
29 accordance with the procedures for a collective bargaining agreement that is
30 scheduled to expire within 75 days before the first day of instruction of a school
31 year, not later than the first day of instruction of the school year. Section 12 of this
32 bill makes a conforming change to indicate that parties to a negotiation between a
33 school district and an employee organization representing teachers may utilize the
34 procedures set forth in section 3 under certain circumstances.
35 Section 4 of this bill provides that if a collective bargaining agreement between
36 a school district and an employee organization representing teachers has expired
37 and the terms of the agreement remain in effect under certain circumstances, the
38 school district or any agent thereof is prohibited from requesting, requiring or
39 urging a teacher to work more in any workday or workweek than the total amount
40 of time required by the expired agreement for each workday or workweek.
41 Existing law declares it to be the public policy of this State that strikes against
42 the State or a local government employer are illegal. (NRS 288.700) Existing law
43 requires a court that finds that such an illegal strike has occurred, or unless enjoined
44 will occur, to enjoin the commencement or continuance of the strike. (NRS
45 288.705) If a strike is commenced or continued in violation of an order enjoining
46 the strike, existing law authorizes a court to impose certain penalties against an
47 employee organization or labor organization guilty of such violation, any officer
48 thereof who is wholly or partly responsible of such violation or any employee of
49 the State or of a local government employer who participates in the strike. (NRS
50 288.710) Existing law also authorizes a State or local government employer to take
51 certain actions against an employee who participates in a strike, including,
52 dismissing, suspending or demoting the employee, canceling the contract of
53 employment for such an employee or withholding all or any part of the salary or
54 wages of the employee which would otherwise accrue. (NRS 288.715)
55 Sections 15 and 16 of this bill provide that the penalties that may be imposed
56 by a court and the actions that may be taken by a local government employer with
57 respect to a strike do not apply to a strike involving teachers or an employee
58 organization representing teachers. Instead, section 7 of this bill provides for the
59 imposition of penalties only on the employee organization and the officers of the
60 employee organization, and not an individual teacher, for an illegal strike.
61 Existing law defines “strike” to mean certain specified concerted conduct.
62 (NRS 288.074) Section 9 of this bill excludes from the definition of “strike” any of
63 the specified concerted conduct that is engaged in by teachers at one or more
64 schools in a school district unless the concerted conduct is engaged in on a district-
65 wide basis.
66 Existing law: (1) requires an employee organization that applies to a local
67 government employer for recognition to provide a pledge in writing not to strike
-
*SB161_R1*

– 3 –
68 against the local government employer; and (2) authorizes a local government
69 employer to withdraw recognition from an employee organization that disavows
70 that pledge. (NRS 288.160) Section 11 of this bill excludes an employee
71 organization representing teachers from those provisions.
72 Sections 2 and 8 of this bill establish a definition for the term “teacher” for the
73 purposes of the provisions of existing law governing collective bargaining by
74 public employees.
75 Section 10 of this bill makes a conforming change to indicate the proper
76 placement of sections 3 and 4 in the Nevada Revised Statutes.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

18 government employees in a bargaining unit. Participation by the
19 Board and its staff in an agreed election is subject to the approval of
20 the Board.
21 Sec. 12. NRS 288.217 is hereby amended to read as follows:
22 288.217 1. [The] Except as otherwise provided in section 3
23 of this act, the provisions of this section govern negotiations
24 between school districts and employee organizations representing
