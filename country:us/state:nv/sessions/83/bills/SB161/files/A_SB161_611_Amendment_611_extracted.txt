Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth various requirements and procedures for collective bargaining
2 between local government employers and local government employees. (NRS 288.131-
3 288.280) Existing law sets forth procedures by which the parties to a negotiation involving a
4 school district and an employee organization representing teachers or educational support
5 personnel, after having failed to reach a collective bargaining agreement after at least four
6 sessions of negotiations, may submit the issues remaining in dispute to a binding arbitration
7 process. (NRS 288.217) Section 3 of this bill sets forth additional procedures by which the
8 parties to a negotiation involving a school district and an employee organization representing
9 teachers may submit issues remaining in dispute to a binding arbitration process. Under
10 section 3, the parties may, by mutual agreement, submit issues remaining in dispute to the
11 binding arbitration process set forth in section 3 if the collective bargaining agreement
12 between the school district and the employee organization representing teachers: (1) [expires
13 during the] is scheduled to expire within 75 days before the first day of instruction of a
14 school year and the parties have not agreed to a successor agreement 75 days before the
15 [commencement] first day of instruction of the school year, in which case the parties may
Senate Amendment No. 611 to Senate Bill No. 161 Page 4
16 submit the issues in dispute to an arbitrator any time on or after the date that is 75 days before
17 the [commencement] first day of instruction of the school year and on or before the date that
18 is 30 days before the [commencement] first day of instruction of the school year; or (2) has
19 expired, in which case the parties may submit the issues in dispute to an arbitrator any time
20 after the expiration of the agreement. Section 3 sets forth procedures for the selection of the
21 arbitrator and procedures and requirements for the arbitration process. Section 3 requires the
22 arbitrator to render a final decision, which is binding on the parties: (1) if the issues in
23 dispute are submitted to the binding arbitration process in accordance with the
24 procedures for a collective bargaining agreement which has expired, not later than 60 days
25 after the parties agreed to submit the issues in dispute to the binding arbitration process; or (2)
26 if the issues in dispute are submitted to the binding arbitration process in accordance
27 with the procedures for a collective bargaining agreement that [has not expired,] is
28 scheduled to expire within 75 days before the first day of instruction of a school year, not
29 later than the [date on which] first day of instruction of the school year . [commences.]
30 Section 12 of this bill makes a conforming change to indicate that parties to a negotiation
31 between a school district and an employee organization representing teachers may utilize the
32 procedures set forth in section 3 under certain circumstances.
33 Section 4 of this bill provides that if a collective bargaining agreement between a school
34 district and an employee organization representing teachers has expired and the terms of the
35 agreement remain in effect under certain circumstances, the school district or any agent
36 thereof is prohibited from requesting, requiring or urging a teacher to work more in any
37 workday or workweek than the total amount of time required by the expired agreement for
38 each workday or workweek.
39 Existing law declares it to be the public policy of this State that strikes against the State or
40 a local government employer are illegal. (NRS 288.700) Existing law requires a court that
41 finds that such an illegal strike has occurred, or unless enjoined will occur, to enjoin the
42 commencement or continuance of the strike. (NRS 288.705) If a strike is commenced or
43 continued in violation of an order enjoining the strike, existing law authorizes a court to
44 impose certain penalties against an employee organization or labor organization guilty of such
45 violation, any officer thereof who is wholly or partly responsible of such violation or any
46 employee of the State or of a local government employer who participates in the strike. (NRS
47 288.710) Existing law also authorizes a State or local government employer to take certain
48 actions against an employee who participates in a strike, including, dismissing, suspending or
49 demoting the employee, canceling the contract of employment for such an employee or
50 withholding all or any part of the salary or wages of the employee which would otherwise
51 accrue. (NRS 288.715)
52 [Section 5 of this bill authorizes an employee organization representing teachers to
53 petition a court for authorization to strike. Section 5 requires the petition to allege that a
54 school district has implemented a policy or allowed a condition to exist that is detrimental to
55 the wellbeing of the pupils within the school district and which the employee organization
56 seeks to alleviate by means of a strike. Section 5 requires the court to grant the petition if the
57 court determines that the proposed strike will be equally or less detrimental to the pupils
58 within the school district than the continuance of the alleged policy or condition. Section 13 of
59 this bill revises certain Legislative findings and declarations to specify that a strike authorized
60 by a court pursuant to section 5 is not against public policy or illegal. Section 14 of this bill
61 provides that the provisions of existing law requiring a court to enjoin a strike do not apply to
62 a strike authorized by section 5.
63 Section 6 of this bill prohibits an employee organization representing teachers and its
64 members from disrupting, interrupting or interfering with the provision of certain services
65 during the course of a strike by the employee organization, regardless of whether the strike is
66 authorized pursuant to section 5.]
67 Sections 15 and 16 of this bill provide that the penalties that may be imposed by a court
68 and the actions that may be taken by a local government employer with respect to a strike do
69 not apply to a strike involving teachers or an employee organization representing teachers . [,
70 regardless of whether the strike is authorized pursuant to section 5.] Instead, section 7 of this
71 bill provides for the imposition of penalties only on the employee organization and the
72 officers of the employee organization, and not an individual teacher, for an illegal strike . [or a
73 violation of section 6.]
Senate Amendment No. 611 to Senate Bill No. 161 Page 5
74 Existing law defines “strike” to mean certain specified concerted conduct. (NRS 288.074)
75 Section 9 of this bill excludes from the definition of “strike” any of the specified concerted
76 conduct that is engaged in by teachers at one or more schools in a school district unless the
77 concerted conduct is engaged in on a district-wide basis.
78 Existing law: (1) requires an employee organization that applies to a local government
79 employer for recognition to provide a pledge in writing not to strike against the local
80 government employer; and (2) authorizes a local government employer to withdraw
81 recognition from an employee organization that disavows that pledge. (NRS 288.160) Section
82 11 of this bill excludes an employee organization representing teachers from those provisions.
83 Sections 2 and 8 of this bill establish a definition for the term “teacher” for the purposes
84 of the provisions of existing law governing collective bargaining by public employees.
85 Section 10 of this bill makes a conforming change to indicate the proper placement of
86 sections 3 and 4 in the Nevada Revised Statutes.

Senate Amendment No. 611 to Senate Bill No. 161 Page 11
1 [(b) “Teacher” means an employee of a school district who is licensed to teach
2 in this State and who is represented by an employee organization.]
3 Sec. 13. [NRS 288.700 is hereby amended to read as follows:
4 288.700 1. The Legislature finds as facts:
5 (a) That the services provided by the State and local government employers are
6 of such nature that they are not and cannot be duplicated from other sources and are
7 essential to the health, safety and welfare of the people of the State of Nevada;
8 (b) That the continuity of such services is likewise essential, and their
9 disruption incompatible with the responsibility of the State to its people; [and]
10 (c) That every person who enters or remains in the employment of the State or
11 a local government employer accepts the facts stated in paragraphs (a) and (b) as an
12 essential condition of the person’s employment [.] ; and
13 (d) Notwithstanding the facts stated in paragraphs (a) and (b), under certain
14 circumstances, a strike by an employee organization representing teachers may
15 serve to alleviate the detriment to the wellbeing of pupils caused by certain
16 policies implemented or conditions allowed to exist by a school district and may
17 be less detrimental to the wellbeing of pupils than allowing such policies or
18 conditions to continue.
19 2. The Legislature therefore declares it to be the public policy of the State of
20 Nevada that strikes against the State or any local government employer , except for
21 certain strikes by an employee organization representing teachers, are illegal.]
22 (Deleted by amendment.)
23 Sec. 14. [NRS 288.705 is hereby amended to read as follows:
24 288.705 1. If a strike occurs against the State or a local government
25 employer, the State or local government employer shall, and if a strike is threatened
26 against the State or a local government employer, the State or local government
27 employer may, apply to a court of competent jurisdiction to enjoin such strike. The
28 application shall set forth the facts constituting the strike or threat to strike.
29 2. If the court finds that an illegal strike has occurred or unless enjoined will
30 occur, it shall enjoin the continuance or commencement of such strike. The
31 provisions of N.R.C.P. 65 and of the other Nevada Rules of Civil Procedure apply
32 generally to proceedings under this section, but the court shall not require security
33 of the State or of any local government employer.
34 3. The provisions of this section do not apply to a strike authorized by a
35 court pursuant to section 5 of this act.] (Deleted by amendment.)
36 Sec. 15. NRS 288.710 is hereby amended to read as follows:
37 288.710 1. If a strike is commenced or continued in violation of an order
38 issued pursuant to NRS 288.705, other than a strike involving teachers or an
39 employee organization representing teachers, the court may:
40 (a) Punish each employee organization or labor organization guilty of such
41 violation by a fine of not more than $50,000 against each employee organization or
42 labor organization for each day of continued violation.
43 (b) Punish any officer of an employee organization or labor organization who
44 is wholly or partly responsible for such violation by a fine of not more than $1,000
45 for each day of continued violation, or by imprisonment as provided in NRS
46 22.110.
47 (c) Punish any employee of the State or of a local government employer who
48 participates in such strike by ordering the dismissal or suspension of such
49 employee.
50 2. Any of the penalties enumerated in subsection 1 may be applied
51 alternatively or cumulatively, in the discretion of the court.
Senate Amendment No. 611 to Senate Bill No. 161 Page 12
1 Sec. 16. NRS 288.715 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 288.715 1. If a strike or violation is commenced or continued in violation of
3 an order issued pursuant to NRS 288.705, other than a strike involving teachers or
4 an employee organization representing teachers, the State or the local government
5 employer may:
6 (a) Dismiss, suspend or demote all or any of the employees who participate in

(BDR 23-34)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to local government employees; establishing additional
procedures pursuant to which parties to a collective bargaining
negotiation involving a school district and an employee organization
representing teachers may submit issues to a binding arbitration
process; prohibiting a school district or any agent thereof from
requiring, requesting or urging a teacher to work more than a certain
amount of time under certain circumstances; [authorizing an employee
organization representing teachers to petition a court for the
authorization to strike; prohibiting an employee organization
representing teachers and its members from engaging in certain
activities during a strike;] revising the penalties that may be imposed
upon an employee organization representing teachers, the officers
thereof and teachers for participation in a strike; revising the conduct
that constitutes a strike; revising provisions relating to the recognition
of employee organizations; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth various requirements and procedures for collective bargaining
2 between local government employers and local government employees. (NRS 288.131-
3 288.280) Existing law sets forth procedures by which the parties to a negotiation involving a
4 school district and an employee organization representing teachers or educational support
5 personnel, after having failed to reach a collective bargaining agreement after at least four
6 sessions of negotiations, may submit the issues remaining in dispute to a binding arbitration
7 process. (NRS 288.217) Section 3 of this bill sets forth additional procedures by which the
8 parties to a negotiation involving a school district and an employee organization representing
9 teachers may submit issues remaining in dispute to a binding arbitration process. Under
10 section 3, the parties may, by mutual agreement, submit issues remaining in dispute to the
11 binding arbitration process set forth in section 3 if the collective bargaining agreement
12 between the school district and the employee organization representing teachers: (1) [expires
13 during the] is scheduled to expire within 75 days before the first day of instruction of a
14 school year and the parties have not agreed to a successor agreement 75 days before the
15 [commencement] first day of instruction of the school year, in which case the parties may

Senate Amendment No. 611 to Senate Bill No. 161 Page 4
16 submit the issues in dispute to an arbitrator any time on or after the date that is 75 days before
17 the [commencement] first day of instruction of the school year and on or before the date that
18 is 30 days before the [commencement] first day of instruction of the school year; or (2) has
19 expired, in which case the parties may submit the issues in dispute to an arbitrator any time
20 after the expiration of the agreement. Section 3 sets forth procedures for the selection of the
21 arbitrator and procedures and requirements for the arbitration process. Section 3 requires the
22 arbitrator to render a final decision, which is binding on the parties: (1) if the issues in
23 dispute are submitted to the binding arbitration process in accordance with the
24 procedures for a collective bargaining agreement which has expired, not later than 60 days
25 after the parties agreed to submit the issues in dispute to the binding arbitration process; or (2)
26 if the issues in dispute are submitted to the binding arbitration process in accordance
27 with the procedures for a collective bargaining agreement that [has not expired,] is
28 scheduled to expire within 75 days before the first day of instruction of a school year, not
29 later than the [date on which] first day of instruction of the school year . [commences.]
30 Section 12 of this bill makes a conforming change to indicate that parties to a negotiation
31 between a school district and an employee organization representing teachers may utilize the
32 procedures set forth in section 3 under certain circumstances.
33 Section 4 of this bill provides that if a collective bargaining agreement between a school
34 district and an employee organization representing teachers has expired and the terms of the
35 agreement remain in effect under certain circumstances, the school district or any agent
36 thereof is prohibited from requesting, requiring or urging a teacher to work more in any
37 workday or workweek than the total amount of time required by the expired agreement for
38 each workday or workweek.
39 Existing law declares it to be the public policy of this State that strikes against the State or
40 a local government employer are illegal. (NRS 288.700) Existing law requires a court that
41 finds that such an illegal strike has occurred, or unless enjoined will occur, to enjoin the
42 commencement or continuance of the strike. (NRS 288.705) If a strike is commenced or
43 continued in violation of an order enjoining the strike, existing law authorizes a court to
44 impose certain penalties against an employee organization or labor organization guilty of such
45 violation, any officer thereof who is wholly or partly responsible of such violation or any
46 employee of the State or of a local government employer who participates in the strike. (NRS
47 288.710) Existing law also authorizes a State or local government employer to take certain
48 actions against an employee who participates in a strike, including, dismissing, suspending or
49 demoting the employee, canceling the contract of employment for such an employee or
50 withholding all or any part of the salary or wages of the employee which would otherwise
51 accrue. (NRS 288.715)
52 [Section 5 of this bill authorizes an employee organization representing teachers to
53 petition a court for authorization to strike. Section 5 requires the petition to allege that a
54 school district has implemented a policy or allowed a condition to exist that is detrimental to
55 the wellbeing of the pupils within the school district and which the employee organization
56 seeks to alleviate by means of a strike. Section 5 requires the court to grant the petition if the
57 court determines that the proposed strike will be equally or less detrimental to the pupils
58 within the school district than the continuance of the alleged policy or condition. Section 13 of
59 this bill revises certain Legislative findings and declarations to specify that a strike authorized
60 by a court pursuant to section 5 is not against public policy or illegal. Section 14 of this bill
61 provides that the provisions of existing law requiring a court to enjoin a strike do not apply to
62 a strike authorized by section 5.
63 Section 6 of this bill prohibits an employee organization representing teachers and its
64 members from disrupting, interrupting or interfering with the provision of certain services
65 during the course of a strike by the employee organization, regardless of whether the strike is
66 authorized pursuant to section 5.]
67 Sections 15 and 16 of this bill provide that the penalties that may be imposed by a court
68 and the actions that may be taken by a local government employer with respect to a strike do
69 not apply to a strike involving teachers or an employee organization representing teachers . [,
70 regardless of whether the strike is authorized pursuant to section 5.] Instead, section 7 of this
71 bill provides for the imposition of penalties only on the employee organization and the
72 officers of the employee organization, and not an individual teacher, for an illegal strike . [or a
73 violation of section 6.]

Senate Amendment No. 611 to Senate Bill No. 161 Page 5
74 Existing law defines “strike” to mean certain specified concerted conduct. (NRS 288.074)
75 Section 9 of this bill excludes from the definition of “strike” any of the specified concerted
76 conduct that is engaged in by teachers at one or more schools in a school district unless the
77 concerted conduct is engaged in on a district-wide basis.
78 Existing law: (1) requires an employee organization that applies to a local government
79 employer for recognition to provide a pledge in writing not to strike against the local
80 government employer; and (2) authorizes a local government employer to withdraw
81 recognition from an employee organization that disavows that pledge. (NRS 288.160) Section
82 11 of this bill excludes an employee organization representing teachers from those provisions.
83 Sections 2 and 8 of this bill establish a definition for the term “teacher” for the purposes
84 of the provisions of existing law governing collective bargaining by public employees.
85 Section 10 of this bill makes a conforming change to indicate the proper placement of
86 sections 3 and 4 in the Nevada Revised Statutes.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 288 of NRS is hereby amended by adding thereto the

28 arbitration proceedings in accordance with the provisions of this section. The
29 number of potential arbitrators on the list and the selection of each potential

3 Sec. 13. [NRS 288.700 is hereby amended to read as follows:
4 288.700 1. The Legislature finds as facts:
5 (a) That the services provided by the State and local government employers are
6 of such nature that they are not and cannot be duplicated from other sources and are
7 essential to the health, safety and welfare of the people of the State of Nevada;
8 (b) That the continuity of such services is likewise essential, and their
9 disruption incompatible with the responsibility of the State to its people; [and]
10 (c) That every person who enters or remains in the employment of the State or
11 a local government employer accepts the facts stated in paragraphs (a) and (b) as an
12 essential condition of the person’s employment [.] ; and
13 (d) Notwithstanding the facts stated in paragraphs (a) and (b), under certain
14 circumstances, a strike by an employee organization representing teachers may
15 serve to alleviate the detriment to the wellbeing of pupils caused by certain
16 policies implemented or conditions allowed to exist by a school district and may
17 be less detrimental to the wellbeing of pupils than allowing such policies or
18 conditions to continue.
19 2. The Legislature therefore declares it to be the public policy of the State of
20 Nevada that strikes against the State or any local government employer , except for
21 certain strikes by an employee organization representing teachers, are illegal.]

24 288.705 1. If a strike occurs against the State or a local government
25 employer, the State or local government employer shall, and if a strike is threatened

27 employer may, apply to a court of competent jurisdiction to enjoin such strike. The
28 application shall set forth the facts constituting the strike or threat to strike.
29 2. If the court finds that an illegal strike has occurred or unless enjoined will
30 occur, it shall enjoin the continuance or commencement of such strike. The
31 provisions of N.R.C.P. 65 and of the other Nevada Rules of Civil Procedure apply
32 generally to proceedings under this section, but the court shall not require security
33 of the State or of any local government employer.
34 3. The provisions of this section do not apply to a strike authorized by a
35 court pursuant to section 5 of this act.] (Deleted by amendment.)
36 Sec. 15. NRS 288.710 is hereby amended to read as follows:
37 288.710 1. If a strike is commenced or continued in violation of an order
38 issued pursuant to NRS 288.705, other than a strike involving teachers or an
39 employee organization representing teachers, the court may:

41 violation by a fine of not more than $50,000 against each employee organization or
42 labor organization for each day of continued violation.
43 (b) Punish any officer of an employee organization or labor organization who

48 participates in such strike by ordering the dismissal or suspension of such
49 employee.
50 2. Any of the penalties enumerated in subsection 1 may be applied
