Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth various requirements and procedures for collective
2 bargaining between local government employers and local government employees.
3 (NRS 288.131-288.280) Existing law sets forth procedures by which the parties to a
4 negotiation involving a school district and an employee organization representing
5 teachers or educational support personnel, after having failed to reach a collective
6 bargaining agreement after at least four sessions of negotiations, may submit the
7 issues remaining in dispute to a binding arbitration process. (NRS 288.217)

– 2 –
8 Section 3 of this bill sets forth additional procedures by which the parties to a
9 negotiation involving a school district and an employee organization representing
10 teachers may submit issues remaining in dispute to a binding arbitration process.
11 Under section 3, the parties may, by mutual agreement, submit issues remaining in
12 dispute to the binding arbitration process set forth in section 3 if the collective
13 bargaining agreement between the school district and the employee organization
14 representing teachers: (1) expires during the school year and the parties have not
15 agreed to a successor agreement 75 days before the commencement of the school
16 year, in which case the parties may submit the issues in dispute to an arbitrator any
17 time on or after the date that is 75 days before the commencement of the school
18 year and on or before the date that is 30 days before the commencement of the
19 school year; or (2) has expired, in which case the parties may submit the issues in
20 dispute to an arbitrator any time after the expiration of the agreement. Section 3
21 sets forth procedures for the selection of the arbitrator and procedures and
22 requirements for the arbitration process. Section 3 requires the arbitrator to render a
23 final decision, which is binding on the parties: (1) for a collective bargaining
24 agreement which has expired, not later than 60 days after the parties agreed to
25 submit the issues in dispute to the binding arbitration process; or (2) for a collective
26 bargaining that has not expired, not later than the date on which the school year
27 commences. Section 12 of this bill makes a conforming change to indicate that
28 parties to a negotiation between a school district and an employee organization
29 representing teachers may utilize the procedures set forth in section 3 under certain
30 circumstances.
31 Section 4 of this bill provides that if a collective bargaining agreement between
32 a school district and an employee organization representing teachers has expired
33 and the terms of the agreement remain in effect under certain circumstances, the
34 school district or any agent thereof is prohibited from requesting, requiring or
35 urging a teacher to work more in any workday or workweek than the total amount
36 of time required by the expired agreement for each workday or workweek.
37 Existing law declares it to be the public policy of this State that strikes against
38 the State or a local government employer are illegal. (NRS 288.700) Existing law
39 requires a court that finds that such an illegal strike has occurred, or unless enjoined
40 will occur, to enjoin the commencement or continuance of the strike. (NRS
41 288.705) If a strike is commenced or continued in violation of an order enjoining
42 the strike, existing law authorizes a court to impose certain penalties against an
43 employee organization or labor organization guilty of such violation, any officer
44 thereof who is wholly or partly responsible of such violation or any employee of
45 the State or of a local government employer who participates in the strike. (NRS
46 288.710) Existing law also authorizes a State or local government employer to take
47 certain actions against an employee who participates in a strike, including,
48 dismissing, suspending or demoting the employee, canceling the contract of
49 employment for such an employee or withholding all or any part of the salary or
50 wages of the employee which would otherwise accrue. (NRS 288.715)
51 Section 5 of this bill authorizes an employee organization representing teachers
52 to petition a court for authorization to strike. Section 5 requires the petition to
53 allege that a school district has implemented a policy or allowed a condition to exist
54 that is detrimental to the wellbeing of the pupils within the school district and
55 which the employee organization seeks to alleviate by means of a strike. Section 5
56 requires the court to grant the petition if the court determines that the proposed
57 strike will be equally or less detrimental to the pupils within the school district than
58 the continuance of the alleged policy or condition. Section 13 of this bill revises
59 certain Legislative findings and declarations to specify that a strike authorized by a
60 court pursuant to section 5 is not against public policy or illegal. Section 14 of this
61 bill provides that the provisions of existing law requiring a court to enjoin a strike
62 do not apply to a strike authorized by section 5.

– 3 –
63 Section 6 of this bill prohibits an employee organization representing teachers
64 and its members from disrupting, interrupting or interfering with the provision of
65 certain services during the course of a strike by the employee organization,
66 regardless of whether the strike is authorized pursuant to section 5.
67 Sections 15 and 16 of this bill provide that the penalties that may be imposed
68 by a court and the actions that may be taken by a local government employer with
69 respect to a strike do not apply to a strike involving teachers or an employee
70 organization representing teachers, regardless of whether the strike is authorized
71 pursuant to section 5. Instead, section 7 of this bill provides for the imposition of
72 penalties only on the employee organization and the officers of the employee
73 organization, and not an individual teacher, for an illegal strike or a violation of
74 section 6.
75 Existing law defines “strike” to mean certain specified concerted conduct.
76 (NRS 288.074) Section 9 of this bill excludes from the definition of “strike” any of
77 the specified concerted conduct that is engaged in by teachers at one or more
78 schools in a school district unless the concerted conduct is engaged in on a district-
79 wide basis.
80 Existing law: (1) requires an employee organization that applies to a local
81 government employer for recognition to provide a pledge in writing not to strike
82 against the local government employer; and (2) authorizes a local government
83 employer to withdraw recognition from an employee organization that disavows
84 that pledge. (NRS 288.160) Section 11 of this bill excludes an employee
85 organization representing teachers from those provisions.
86 Sections 2 and 8 of this bill establish a definition for the term “teacher” for the
87 purposes of the provisions of existing law governing collective bargaining by
88 public employees.
89 Section 10 of this bill makes a conforming change to indicate the proper
90 placement of sections 3 and 4 in the Nevada Revised Statutes.

22 and welfare of the people of the State of Nevada;
23 (b) That the continuity of such services is likewise essential, and
24 their disruption incompatible with the responsibility of the State to
25 its people; [and]
26 (c) That every person who enters or remains in the employment
27 of the State or a local government employer accepts the facts stated
28 in paragraphs (a) and (b) as an essential condition of the person’s
29 employment [.] ; and
30 (d) Notwithstanding the facts stated in paragraphs (a) and (b),
31 under certain circumstances, a strike by an employee organization
32 representing teachers may serve to alleviate the detriment to the
33 wellbeing of pupils caused by certain policies implemented or
34 conditions allowed to exist by a school district and may be less
35 detrimental to the wellbeing of pupils than allowing such policies
36 or conditions to continue.
37 2. The Legislature therefore declares it to be the public policy
38 of the State of Nevada that strikes against the State or any local
39 government employer , except for certain strikes by an employee
40 organization representing teachers, are illegal.
41 Sec. 14. NRS 288.705 is hereby amended to read as follows:
42 288.705 1. If a strike occurs against the State or a local
43 government employer, the State or local government employer shall,
44 and if a strike is threatened against the State or a local government
45 employer, the State or local government employer may, apply to a

1 court of competent jurisdiction to enjoin such strike. The application
2 shall set forth the facts constituting the strike or threat to strike.
3 2. If the court finds that an illegal strike has occurred or unless
4 enjoined will occur, it shall enjoin the continuance or
5 commencement of such strike. The provisions of N.R.C.P. 65 and of
6 the other Nevada Rules of Civil Procedure apply generally to
7 proceedings under this section, but the court shall not require
8 security of the State or of any local government employer.
9 3. The provisions of this section do not apply to a strike
10 authorized by a court pursuant to section 5 of this act.
11 Sec. 15. NRS 288.710 is hereby amended to read as follows:
12 288.710 1. If a strike is commenced or continued in violation
13 of an order issued pursuant to NRS 288.705, other than a strike
14 involving teachers or an employee organization representing
15 teachers, the court may:
16 (a) Punish each employee organization or labor organization
17 guilty of such violation by a fine of not more than $50,000 against
18 each employee organization or labor organization for each day of
19 continued violation.
20 (b) Punish any officer of an employee organization or labor
21 organization who is wholly or partly responsible for such violation
22 by a fine of not more than $1,000 for each day of continued
23 violation, or by imprisonment as provided in NRS 22.110.
24 (c) Punish any employee of the State or of a local government
25 employer who participates in such strike by ordering the dismissal
26 or suspension of such employee.
27 2. Any of the penalties enumerated in subsection 1 may be
28 applied alternatively or cumulatively, in the discretion of the court.
29 Sec. 16. NRS 288.715 is hereby amended to read as follows:
30 288.715 1. If a strike or violation is commenced or continued
31 in violation of an order issued pursuant to NRS 288.705, other than
32 a strike involving teachers or an employee organization
33 representing teachers, the State or the local government employer
34 may:
35 (a) Dismiss, suspend or demote all or any of the employees who
36 participate in such strike or violation.
37 (b) Cancel the contracts of employment of all or any of the
38 employees who participate in such strike or violation.
39 (c) Withhold all or any part of the salaries or wages which
40 would otherwise accrue to all or any of the employees who
41 participate in such strike or violation.
42 2. Any of the powers conferred by subsection 1 may be
43 exercised alternatively or cumulatively.
