AN ACT relating to forestry; revising provisions relating to logging permits;

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, a timber owner or the agent of a timber owner is required to secure a
2 logging permit from the State Forester Firewarden prior to any logging or cutting operation.
3 (NRS 528.042) Existing law defines the term “logging operation” as the commercial
4 harvesting of trees by a timber owner or the agent of a timber owner using certain methods.
5 (NRS 528.0175) [This] Section 1 of this bill removes the requirement to secure a logging
6 permit for a cutting operation.
7 Existing law requires every timber owner or operator to sow suitable grass seed on
8 certain trails, roads and landings upon completion of a logging or cutting operation.
9 (NRS 528.057) Existing law also requires the holder of a timberland conversion
10 certificate to provide a copy of the certificate to any timber operator prior to any logging
11 or cutting operation on land covered by the certificate. (NRS 528.086) Sections 1.3 and
12 1.7 of this bill remove such requirements for a cutting operation.
