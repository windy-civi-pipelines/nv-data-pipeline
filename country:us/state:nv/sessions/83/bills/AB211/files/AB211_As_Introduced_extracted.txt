6 Sec. 30. 1. If the district court finds that there is a

16 provided in this paragraph, the offer for first right of occupancy to
17 the tenant must be in writing and sent by certified mail to the
18 address given by the tenant at the time of relocation. If the owner

A.B. 211
ASSEMBLY BILL NO. 211–ASSEMBLYMEMBER CONSIDINE
PREFILED FEBRUARY 3, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Government Affairs
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to substandard
properties. (BDR 20-811)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to property; authorizing a county or city to require
a property owner to repair or rehabilitate or abate certain
conditions on a residential property under certain
circumstances; establishing procedures relating to a
property owner’s failure to repair or rehabilitate or abate
certain conditions on the residential property; authorizing
certain local governments and persons to bring an action
to require the repair or rehabilitation or abatement or
appoint a receiver for substandard property in certain
circumstances; establishing the powers and duties of a
receiver appointed for substandard property; making
various other changes relating to substandard properties;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law: (1) requires a landlord to maintain a dwelling unit in a habitable
2 condition at all times during the tenancy; and (2) provides that a dwelling unit is not
3 habitable if it violates provisions of housing or health codes concerning the health,
4 safety, sanitation or fitness for habitation. (NRS 118A.290)
5 Sections 8 and 27 of this bill provide that: (1) if a residential property is
6 maintained in a way that violates any applicable habitability standard, housing code
7 or building code, or any statute or ordinance relating to habitability, building safety
8 or fire safety; and (2) as a result of the violation or violations, the condition of the
9 residential property is of such a nature that the health and safety of residents or the
10 public are substantially endangered, the appropriate department of the county or
11 city, as applicable, may notify the owner and order that the owner repair or
12 rehabilitate the property or abate the condition. Sections 8 and 27 also set forth
13 certain requirements for the notice.

39 and construction plan for the satisfactory rehabilitation of the
40 substandard property.

6 Sec. 30. 1. If the district court finds that there is a

11 (a) Order the owner of the substandard property to pay all

16 provided in this paragraph, the offer for first right of occupancy to
17 the tenant must be in writing and sent by certified mail to the
18 address given by the tenant at the time of relocation. If the owner
19 has not been provided the address of the tenant by the tenant as
20 required by this section, the owner is not required to offer the

40 is not substantially responsible for causing or contributing to the
41 condition must be paid these benefits and moving costs at the time
