to deprive any owner of a residential multifamily rental property or substandard
property any right guaranteed by the United States Constitution or Nevada

benefits and moving costs at the time that the tenant actually
relocates.

Section 57:
4. If the district court finds that it is not possible to provide a
tenant with the benefits described in paragraph (c) of subsection 1,

AN ACT relating to property; requiring a county or city to require a
property owner to repair or rehabilitate or abate certain
conditions on a residential multifamily rental property under
certain circumstances; establishing procedures relating to a
property owner’s failure to repair or rehabilitate or abate
certain conditions on the residential multifamily rental

other changes relating to substandard properties; and

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law: (1) requires a landlord to maintain a dwelling unit in a habitable
condition at all times during the tenancy; and (2) provides that a dwelling unit is not
habitable if it violates provisions of housing or health codes concerning the health,

and
(b) The repairs, rehabilitations and abatements that the district

endangers the health and safety of the residents of the
substandard property, upon the entry of any order or judgment
pursuant to section 29 of this act, the district court shall:
(a) Order the owner of the substandard property to pay all

(5) The cost of disconnecting, dismantling, removing,
reassembling, reconnecting and reinstalling machinery,
equipment or other personal property of the tenant, including

not more than 120 days.
(d) Determine the date when the tenant is to relocate, and
order the tenant to notify the governing body of the city or its
designee and the owner of the dwelling unit of the address to

dwelling unit for rent to a third party. Except as otherwise
provided in this paragraph, the offer for first right of occupancy to
the tenant must be in writing and sent by certified mail to the
address given by the tenant at the time of relocation. If the owner
has not been provided the address of the tenant by the tenant as
required by this section, the owner is not required to offer the
tenant the first right of occupancy. The tenant may accept the
offer by giving the owner notice in writing by certified mail not
later than 10 days after the owner mailed the offer.

ordered to relocate due to the conditions found by the district court

benefits and moving costs at the time that the tenant actually
relocates.
4. If the district court finds that it is not possible to provide a
tenant with the benefits described in paragraph (c) of subsection 1,
the district court may award such other equitable or declaratory
relief as the court finds necessary.
Sec. 31. 1. If the district court appoints a receiver for a
substandard property pursuant to section 29 of this act, the owner
