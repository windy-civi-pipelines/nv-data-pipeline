3 habitable if it violates provisions of housing or health codes concerning the health,
4 safety, sanitation or fitness for habitation. (NRS 118A.290)

6 property is maintained in a way that violates any applicable habitability standard,
7 housing code or building code, or any statute or ordinance relating to habitability,
8 building safety or fire safety; and (2) as a result of the violation or violations, the
9 condition of the residential multifamily rental property is of such a nature that the
10 health and safety of residents or the public are substantially endangered,
11 the appropriate department of the county or city, as applicable, is required to notify
12 the owner and order that the owner repair or rehabilitate the property or abate the
13 condition. Sections 8 and 27 also set forth certain requirements for the notice.

18 substandard property, including an action to have a receiver appointed to manage
19 the repair or rehabilitation of the substandard property.
20 Sections 10 and 29 of this bill: (1) set forth certain findings and considerations
21 that must be made by the district court in order to declare a residential multifamily

26 are necessary to correct each violation of a habitability standard, housing code or
27 building code, or any statute or ordinance relating to habitability, building safety or

30 is a condition of the substandard property which substantially endangers the health
31 and safety of the residents, the district court must: (1) order the owner of the
32 substandard property to pay all reasonable and actual costs of the board of county
33 commissioners or governing body of the city, as applicable; (2) order that the board
