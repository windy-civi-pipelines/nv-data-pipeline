Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law: (1) requires a landlord to maintain a dwelling unit in a habitable condition
2 at all times during the tenancy; and (2) provides that a dwelling unit is not habitable if it
3 violates provisions of housing or health codes concerning the health, safety, sanitation or
4 fitness for habitation. (NRS 118A.290)
5 Sections 8 and 27 of this bill provide that: (1) if a residential property is maintained in a
6 way that violates any applicable habitability standard, housing code or building code, or any
7 statute or ordinance relating to habitability, building safety or fire safety; and (2) as a result of
8 the violation or violations, the condition of the residential property is of such a nature that the
9 health and safety of residents or the public are substantially endangered, the appropriate
10 department of the county or city, as applicable, may notify the owner and order that the owner
11 repair or rehabilitate the property or abate the condition. Sections 8 and 27 also set forth
12 certain requirements for the notice.
13 Sections 9 and 28 of this bill provide that if the owner of the residential property fails to
14 comply with the terms of the notice and summary order, the county or city, as applicable,
15 certain actions may be brought to have the residential property declared to be a substandard
16 property, including an action to have a receiver appointed to manage the repair or
17 rehabilitation of the substandard property.
18 Sections 10 and 29 of this bill: (1) set forth certain findings and considerations that must
19 be made by the district court in order to declare a residential property to be a substandard
20 property; and (2) require an order issued by the district court declaring a residential property
21 to be a substandard property to set forth the conditions that make the residential property a

Assembly Amendment No. 47 to Assembly Bill No. 211 Page 4
22 substandard property and the repairs, rehabilitations and abatements that are necessary to
23 correct each violation of a habitability standard, housing code or building code, or any statute
24 or ordinance relating to habitability, building safety or fire safety.
25 Sections 11 and 30 of this bill provide that if the district court finds that there is a
26 condition of the substandard property which substantially endangers the health and safety of
27 the residents, the district court must: (1) order the owner of the substandard property to pay all
28 reasonable and actual costs of the board of county commissioners or governing body of the
29 city, as applicable; (2) order that the board of county commissioners or governing body of the
30 city provide each tenant with notice of the judgment and court order; (3) order, uncertain

33 orders.

35 substandard property.
36 Sections 13 and 32 of this bill provide that a receiver appointed for a substandard
37 property is entitled to the same fees, commissions and necessary expenses as a receiver in an
38 action to foreclose a mortgage.
39 Sections 14 and 33 of this bill require a receiver appointed for a substandard property to
40 prepare and submit monthly reports to the board of county commissioners or governing body
41 of a city.
42 Sections 15 and 34 of this bill: (1) require the district court to discharge the receiver for a
43 substandard property under certain circumstances; and (2) authorize the district court to retain
44 jurisdiction over the substandard property for a period of time not to exceed 18 consecutive
45 months.
46 Sections 16 and 35 of this bill authorize the district court to require the owner of a
47 substandard property to pay all unrecovered costs associated with the receivership.
48 Sections 17 and 36 of this bill provide that the remedies and penalties set forth in
49 sections 2-18 and 21-37 of this bill are cumulative, may not be abrogated and are in addition
50 to any other remedies or penalties that may exist in law or equity.
51 Sections 18 and 37 provide that nothing in sections 2-18 and 21-37 is intended to
52 deprive any owner of a residential property or substandard property any right guaranteed by
53 the United States Constitution or Nevada Constitution, including, without limitation, the right
54 to due process.
55 Existing law authorizes a receiver to be appointed in certain actions. (NRS 32.010)
56 Section 19 of this bill authorizes a receiver to be appointed in an action to have a residential
57 property declared to be a substandard property that is brought pursuant to section 10 or 29 to
58 manage the repair or rehabilitation of the substandard property.
59 Sections 2-7 and 21-26 define certain terms used in the provisions of sections 2-18 and
60 21-37, respectively.
