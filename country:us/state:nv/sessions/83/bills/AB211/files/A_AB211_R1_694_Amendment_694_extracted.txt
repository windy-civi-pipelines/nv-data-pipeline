residential multifamily rental property under certain circumstances;
establishing procedures relating to a property owner’s failure to repair
or rehabilitate or abate certain conditions on the residential
multifamily rental property; authorizing certain local governments

circumstances; establishing the powers and duties of a receiver

relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law: (1) requires a landlord to maintain a dwelling unit in a habitable condition
2 at all times during the tenancy; and (2) provides that a dwelling unit is not habitable if it
3 violates provisions of housing or health codes concerning the health, safety, sanitation or
4 fitness for habitation. (NRS 118A.290)
5 Sections 8 and 27 of this bill provide that: (1) if a residential multifamily rental
6 property is maintained in a way that violates any applicable habitability standard, housing
7 code or building code, or any statute or ordinance relating to habitability, building safety or
8 fire safety; and (2) as a result of the violation or violations, the condition of the residential
9 multifamily rental property is of such a nature that the health and safety of residents or the
10 public are substantially endangered, the appropriate department of the county or city, as
11 applicable, [may] is required to notify the owner and order that the owner repair or
12 rehabilitate the property or abate the condition. Sections 8 and 27 also set forth certain
13 requirements for the notice.
14 Sections 9 and 28 of this bill provide that if the owner of the residential multifamily
15 rental property fails to comply with the terms of the notice and summary order [,] issued by
16 the county or city, as applicable, certain actions may be brought to have the residential
17 multifamily rental property declared to be a substandard property, including an action to
18 have a receiver appointed to manage the repair or rehabilitation of the substandard property.
19 Sections 10 and 29 of this bill: (1) set forth certain findings and considerations that must
20 be made by the district court in order to declare a residential multifamily rental property to
Senate Amendment No. 694 to Assembly Bill No. 211 First Reprint Page 4
21 be a substandard property; and (2) require an order issued by the district court declaring a
22 residential multifamily rental property to be a substandard property to set forth the
23 conditions that make the residential multifamily rental property a substandard property and
24 the repairs, rehabilitations and abatements that are necessary to correct each violation of a
25 habitability standard, housing code or building code, or any statute or ordinance relating to
26 habitability, building safety or fire safety.
27 Sections 11 and 30 of this bill provide that if the district court finds that there is a
28 condition of the substandard property which substantially endangers the health and safety of
29 the residents, the district court must: (1) order the owner of the substandard property to pay all
30 reasonable and actual costs of the board of county commissioners or governing body of the
31 city, as applicable; (2) order that the board of county commissioners or governing body of the
32 city provide each tenant with notice of the judgment and court order; (3) under certain
33 circumstances, order the owner to provide or pay certain relocation benefits and
34 compensation to the tenants; (4) determine the date when a tenant has to relocate; and (5)
35 make certain other orders.
36 Sections 12 and 31 of this bill set forth certain duties for a receiver appointed for a
37 substandard property.
38 Sections 13 and 32 of this bill provide that a receiver appointed for a substandard
39 property is entitled to the same fees, commissions and necessary expenses as a receiver in an
40 action to foreclose a mortgage.
41 Sections 14 and 33 of this bill require a receiver appointed for a substandard property to
42 prepare and submit monthly reports to the board of county commissioners or governing body
43 of a city [.] and the board of county commissioners or governing body of a city to submit
44 the reports annually to the Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau for transmittal to
45 the Legislature or Legislative Commission.
46 Sections 15 and 34 of this bill: (1) require the district court to discharge the receiver for a
47 substandard property under certain circumstances; and (2) authorize the district court to retain
48 jurisdiction over the substandard property for a period of time not to exceed 18 consecutive
49 months.
50 Sections 16 and 35 of this bill authorize the district court to require the owner of a
51 substandard property to pay all unrecovered costs associated with the receivership.
52 Sections 17 and 36 of this bill provide that the remedies and penalties set forth in
53 sections 2-18 and 21-37 of this bill are cumulative, may not be abrogated and are in addition
54 to any other remedies or penalties that may exist in law or equity.
55 Sections 18 and 37 provide that nothing in sections 2-18 and 21-37 is intended to
56 deprive any owner of a residential multifamily rental property or substandard property any
57 right guaranteed by the United States Constitution or Nevada Constitution, including, without
58 limitation, the right to due process.
59 Existing law authorizes a receiver to be appointed in certain actions [.] and the Uniform
60 Commercial Real Estate Receivership Act establishes provisions governing the
61 appointment and powers of a receiver for real property. (NRS 32.010 , 32.100-32.370)
62 Section 19 of this bill authorizes a receiver to be appointed in an action to have a residential
63 multifamily rental property declared to be a substandard property that is brought pursuant to
64 section 10 or 29 to manage the repair or rehabilitation of the substandard property. Sections
65 10 and 29 also clarify that the Uniform Commercial Real Estate Receivership Act and
66 any rules adopted pursuant thereto by the Nevada Supreme Court apply to a receiver
67 appointed pursuant to sections 10 or 29, as applicable.
68 Sections 2-7 and 21-26 define certain terms used in the provisions of sections 2-18 and
69 21-37, respectively.

AN ACT relating to property; [authorizing] requiring a county or city to require a
property owner to repair or rehabilitate or abate certain conditions on a
residential multifamily rental property under certain circumstances;
establishing procedures relating to a property owner’s failure to repair
or rehabilitate or abate certain conditions on the residential
multifamily rental property; authorizing certain local governments
and persons to bring an action to require the repair or rehabilitation or
abatement or appoint a receiver for substandard property in certain
circumstances; establishing the powers and duties of a receiver
appointed for substandard property; making various other changes
relating to substandard properties; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law: (1) requires a landlord to maintain a dwelling unit in a habitable condition
2 at all times during the tenancy; and (2) provides that a dwelling unit is not habitable if it
3 violates provisions of housing or health codes concerning the health, safety, sanitation or
4 fitness for habitation. (NRS 118A.290)
5 Sections 8 and 27 of this bill provide that: (1) if a residential multifamily rental
6 property is maintained in a way that violates any applicable habitability standard, housing
7 code or building code, or any statute or ordinance relating to habitability, building safety or
8 fire safety; and (2) as a result of the violation or violations, the condition of the residential
9 multifamily rental property is of such a nature that the health and safety of residents or the
10 public are substantially endangered, the appropriate department of the county or city, as
11 applicable, [may] is required to notify the owner and order that the owner repair or
12 rehabilitate the property or abate the condition. Sections 8 and 27 also set forth certain
13 requirements for the notice.
14 Sections 9 and 28 of this bill provide that if the owner of the residential multifamily
15 rental property fails to comply with the terms of the notice and summary order [,] issued by
16 the county or city, as applicable, certain actions may be brought to have the residential
17 multifamily rental property declared to be a substandard property, including an action to
18 have a receiver appointed to manage the repair or rehabilitation of the substandard property.
19 Sections 10 and 29 of this bill: (1) set forth certain findings and considerations that must
20 be made by the district court in order to declare a residential multifamily rental property to

Senate Amendment No. 694 to Assembly Bill No. 211 First Reprint Page 4
21 be a substandard property; and (2) require an order issued by the district court declaring a
22 residential multifamily rental property to be a substandard property to set forth the
23 conditions that make the residential multifamily rental property a substandard property and
24 the repairs, rehabilitations and abatements that are necessary to correct each violation of a
25 habitability standard, housing code or building code, or any statute or ordinance relating to
26 habitability, building safety or fire safety.
27 Sections 11 and 30 of this bill provide that if the district court finds that there is a
28 condition of the substandard property which substantially endangers the health and safety of
29 the residents, the district court must: (1) order the owner of the substandard property to pay all
30 reasonable and actual costs of the board of county commissioners or governing body of the
31 city, as applicable; (2) order that the board of county commissioners or governing body of the
32 city provide each tenant with notice of the judgment and court order; (3) under certain
33 circumstances, order the owner to provide or pay certain relocation benefits and
34 compensation to the tenants; (4) determine the date when a tenant has to relocate; and (5)
35 make certain other orders.
36 Sections 12 and 31 of this bill set forth certain duties for a receiver appointed for a
37 substandard property.
38 Sections 13 and 32 of this bill provide that a receiver appointed for a substandard
39 property is entitled to the same fees, commissions and necessary expenses as a receiver in an
40 action to foreclose a mortgage.
41 Sections 14 and 33 of this bill require a receiver appointed for a substandard property to
42 prepare and submit monthly reports to the board of county commissioners or governing body
43 of a city [.] and the board of county commissioners or governing body of a city to submit
44 the reports annually to the Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau for transmittal to
45 the Legislature or Legislative Commission.
46 Sections 15 and 34 of this bill: (1) require the district court to discharge the receiver for a
47 substandard property under certain circumstances; and (2) authorize the district court to retain
48 jurisdiction over the substandard property for a period of time not to exceed 18 consecutive
49 months.
50 Sections 16 and 35 of this bill authorize the district court to require the owner of a
51 substandard property to pay all unrecovered costs associated with the receivership.
52 Sections 17 and 36 of this bill provide that the remedies and penalties set forth in
53 sections 2-18 and 21-37 of this bill are cumulative, may not be abrogated and are in addition
54 to any other remedies or penalties that may exist in law or equity.
55 Sections 18 and 37 provide that nothing in sections 2-18 and 21-37 is intended to
56 deprive any owner of a residential multifamily rental property or substandard property any
57 right guaranteed by the United States Constitution or Nevada Constitution, including, without
58 limitation, the right to due process.
59 Existing law authorizes a receiver to be appointed in certain actions [.] and the Uniform
60 Commercial Real Estate Receivership Act establishes provisions governing the
61 appointment and powers of a receiver for real property. (NRS 32.010 , 32.100-32.370)
62 Section 19 of this bill authorizes a receiver to be appointed in an action to have a residential
63 multifamily rental property declared to be a substandard property that is brought pursuant to
64 section 10 or 29 to manage the repair or rehabilitation of the substandard property. Sections
65 10 and 29 also clarify that the Uniform Commercial Real Estate Receivership Act and
66 any rules adopted pursuant thereto by the Nevada Supreme Court apply to a receiver
67 appointed pursuant to sections 10 or 29, as applicable.
68 Sections 2-7 and 21-26 define certain terms used in the provisions of sections 2-18 and
69 21-37, respectively.

51 benefits and moving costs at the time that the tenant actually relocates.

Senate Amendment No. 694 to Assembly Bill No. 211 First Reprint Page 9
