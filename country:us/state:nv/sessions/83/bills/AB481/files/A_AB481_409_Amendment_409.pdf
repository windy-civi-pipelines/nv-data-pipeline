3 Service Development Fund to air carriers that meet certain requirements. (NRS 231.690-
4 231.720) Section 2 of this bill creates the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Incentive Fund in the
5 State Treasury to be administered by the State Treasurer. Section 3 of this bill creates the
6 Sustainable Aviation Fuel Incentive Program to provide incentives of money to domestic air
7 carriers for the purchase of sustainable aviation fuel produced in this State. Section 4 of this
8 bill makes an appropriation of $10,000,000 to the Fund for the Program.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN

3 Sec. 2. 1. The Sustainable Aviation Fuel Incentive Fund is hereby
4 created in the State Treasury as a special revenue fund.
5 2. The Sustainable Aviation Fuel Incentive Fund is a continuing fund
6 without reversion. The interest and income earned on the money in the Fund
7 must, after deducting any applicable charges, be credited to the Fund. All claims
8 against the Fund must be paid as other claims against the State are paid.
9 3. The State Treasurer shall administer the Fund. The money in the Fund
10 must be used by the State Treasurer to carry out the Sustainable Aviation Fuel
11 Incentive Program created pursuant to section 3 of this act.
12 4. The State Treasurer may apply for and accept gifts, grants, donations,
13 bequests and any other source of money available under federal law and from

Assembly Amendment No. 409 to Assembly Bill No. 481 Page 4
1 private sources for deposit in the Fund to carry out the provisions of the
2 Sustainable Aviation Fuel Incentive Program created by section 3 of this act.
3 Sec. 3. 1. The Sustainable Aviation Fuel Incentive Program is hereby
4 created for the purpose of providing incentives of money for the purchase of
5 sustainable aviation fuel produced in this State.
6 2. A domestic air carrier based in the United States is eligible to receive
7 from the Program for the purchase of sustainable aviation fuel produced in this
8 State an incentive [:
9 (a) Of $1.75 per gallon for the purchase of sustainable aviation fuel
10 produced outside of this State; and
11 (b) Of] of $2.50 per gallon . [for the purchase of sustainable aviation fuel
12 produced in this State.]
13 3. A carrier that qualifies for an incentive from the Program pursuant to
14 subsection 2 may obtain an incentive by submitting a claim to the State
15 Treasurer. The State Treasurer shall review any claim submitted pursuant to this
16 subsection to confirm that the air carrier qualifies for an incentive from the
17 Program.
18 4. The State Treasurer may adopt regulations to carry out the provisions of
19 this section.
20 5. As used in this section:
21 (a) “Air carrier” means a person who provides commercial air
22 transportation to passengers.
23 (b) “Sustainable aviation fuel” means liquid fuel that meets the criteria set
24 forth in subsections (d) and (e) of 26 U.S.C. § 40B.
25 Sec. 4. There is hereby appropriated from the State General Fund to the
26 Sustainable Aviation Fuel Incentive Fund created by section 2 of this act the sum of
27 $10,000,000 to award incentives from the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Incentive
28 Program created by section 3 of this act.
29 Sec. 5. 1. The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
30 (a) Section 9 of Article 8 of the Nevada Constitution contains a provision
31 commonly known as a “gift clause” which restricts the State under certain
32 circumstances from donating or loaning the State’s money or credit to any
33 company, association or corporation, except corporations formed for educational or
34 charitable purposes.
35 (b) In Employers Insurance Company of Nevada v. State Board of Examiners,
36 117 Nev. 249, 258 (2001), the Nevada Supreme Court held that the State loans its
37 credit in violation of Section 9 of Article 8 of the Nevada Constitution only when
38 “the State acts as a surety or guarantor for the debts of a company, corporation or
39 association.”
40 (c) In Lawrence v. Clark County, 127 Nev. 390, 399 (2011), the Nevada
41 Supreme Court held that the State does not donate, loan or “gift” its money in
42 violation of Section 9 of Article 8 of the Nevada Constitution when the State
43 dispenses state funds for a public purpose and the State receives a valuable benefit
44 or fair consideration in exchange for the dispensation of the state funds.
45 (d) In State ex rel. Brennan v. Bowman, 89 Nev. 330, 333 (1973), the Nevada
46 Supreme Court held that legislation which promotes economic development and
47 seeks to create, protect or enhance job opportunities “inures to the public benefit”
48 and serves important public purposes because it assists in “relieving unemployment
49 and maintaining a stable economy.”
50 (e) In Lawrence v. Clark County, 127 Nev. 390, 399, 406 (2011), the Nevada
51 Supreme Court adopted the public trust doctrine in this State, noting that the public
52 possesses inviolable rights to the natural resources of the State and the State must
53 serve as trustee of the public resources and finding that the “constitutional policy

Assembly Amendment No. 409 to Assembly Bill No. 481 Page 5
1 contained in the gift clause infers the people’s intent to constrain the Legislature’s
2 ability to alienate public trust lands as well as public funds.”
3 (f) Section 3 of Article 9 of the Nevada Constitution restricts the ability of the
4 State to contract public debts, but makes an exception for “any and all contracts
5 necessary, expedient or advisable for the protection and preservation of any of its
6 property or natural resources, or for the purposes of obtaining the benefits thereof,”
7 which further emphasizes the constitutionally mandated importance of the
8 protection and preservation of the natural resources of this State.
9 (g) In McLaughlin v. Housing Authority of the City of Las Vegas, 68 Nev. 84,
10 93 (1951) and Lawrence v. Clark County, 127 Nev. 390, 399 (2011), the Nevada
11 Supreme Court held that when the Legislature authorizes a state agency to dispense
12 state funds, the courts will:
13 (1) Carefully examine whether the Legislature made an informed and
14 appropriate finding that the dispensation of the state funds serves a public purpose
15 and the State receives a valuable benefit or fair consideration in exchange for the
16 dispensation;
17 (2) Give great weight and due deference to the Legislature’s finding, and
18 the courts will uphold the Legislature’s “finding unless it clearly appears to be
19 erroneous and without reasonable foundation;” and
20 (3) Closely examine whether the dispensing state agency reviews all facts,
21 figures and necessary information when making the dispensation, and when the
22 state agency has done so, it will not be second-guessed by the courts.
23 2. The Legislature hereby further finds and declares that:
24 (a) The release of greenhouse gases traps heat in the Earth’s atmosphere,
25 driving climate change.
26 (b) The United States Environmental Protection Agency has concluded that
27 certain large subsonic jet aircraft and subsonic propeller driven airplanes that are
28 used in all domestic and international flights originating in the United States are
29 responsible for 10 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation
30 sector in the United States and 3 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions in the
31 United States.
32 (c) According to the Federal Aviation Administration, about 10 percent of all
33 aircraft emissions occur close to the surface of the Earth near ground level and most
34 particulate matter that affects communities surrounding an airport are the result of
35 emissions released during landing and takeoff.
36 (d) Climate change threatens the health, lives and safety of Nevada’s residents,
37 as well as Nevada’s diverse ecosystems, wildlands and wildlife. Rising
38 temperatures have increased the severity and length of droughts and the frequency
39 and intensity of wildfires.
40 (e) Climate change threatens Nevada’s economy. Rising temperatures,
41 compounded by the urban heat island effect, will likely make summers in Southern
42 Nevada dangerously hot, potentially deterring visitors and reducing the hours when
43 it is safe to engage in outdoor activities, such as construction.
44 (f) Throughout this State, rising temperatures will impact public health by
45 increasing heat stress on vulnerable populations and increasing air pollution from
46 more frequent wildfires.
47 (g) The State of Nevada and its residents will benefit from the diversification
48 and economic growth driven by a transition to a low-carbon emission aviation
49 transportation sector.
50 3. The Legislature lastly finds and declares that:
51 (a) The state program developed and carried into effect pursuant to this act will
52 not result in the State acting as a surety or guarantor of the debts of an air carrier
53 receiving an incentive of money.

Assembly Amendment No. 409 to Assembly Bill No. 481 Page 6
1 (b) The purpose of this act is to develop and carry into effect a state program to
2 encourage the production and purchase of sustainable aviation fuel in this State for
3 the purposes of:
4 (1) Developing the market and industry for sustainable aviation fuel in this
5 State and promoting jobs and businesses in this State in the sustainable aviation fuel
6 industry; and
7 (2) Reducing greenhouse gases emitted by domestic air carriers that
8 operate in this State, specifically emissions occurring on takeoff and landing at
9 airports in this State.
10 (c) The promotion and development of the sustainable fuel industry in this
11 State is an important public purpose which incentivizes the development of
12 business and industry in this State.
13 (d) The protection and preservation of the natural resources of this State by
14 incentivizing the purchase of sustainable aviation fuel is an important public
15 purpose which will limit the emissions of greenhouse gasses from air carriers
16 operating in this State and thus lower the contributions air travel in this State make
17 to climate change, which threatens the health, safety and welfare of the residents of
18 this State and the economy of this State.
19 (e) The provisions of this act are intended to serve an important public purpose
20 and ensure that the State receives valuable benefits and fair consideration in
21 exchange for each incentive of money from the program because:
22 (1) The program requires the dispensing agency to review all facts, figures
23 and necessary information when making each incentive of money from the program
24 to ensure the incentive meets the requirements of the program;
25 (2) The promotion and development of the sustainable fuel industry in this
26 State and the protection and preservation of the natural resources of this State are
27 important public purposes that promote job growth in this State and protect the
28 health, safety and welfare of the residents of this State; and
29 (3) The dispensing state agency may not make an incentive of money from
30 the program unless the air carrier purchases sustainable aviation fuel in accordance
31 with the requirements of the program.
