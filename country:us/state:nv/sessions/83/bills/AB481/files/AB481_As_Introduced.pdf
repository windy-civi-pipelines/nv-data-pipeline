10 Fund to carry out the provisions of the Sustainable Aviation Fuel
11 Incentive Program created by section 3 of this act.
12 Sec. 3. 1. The Sustainable Aviation Fuel Incentive
13 Program is hereby created for the purpose of providing incentives
14 of money for the purchase of sustainable aviation fuel in this
15 State.
16 2. A domestic air carrier based in the United States is eligible
17 to receive from the Program for the purchase of sustainable
18 aviation fuel in this State an incentive:
19 (a) Of $1.75 per gallon for the purchase of sustainable
20 aviation fuel produced outside of this State; and
21 (b) Of $2.50 per gallon for the purchase of sustainable
22 aviation fuel produced in this State.
23 3. A carrier that qualifies for an incentive from the Program

28 4. The State Treasurer may adopt regulations to carry out the
29 provisions of this section.
30 5. As used in this section:
31 (a) “Air carrier” means a person who provides commercial air

34 the criteria set forth in subsections (d) and (e) of 26 U.S.C. § 40B.
35 Sec. 4. There is hereby appropriated from the State General
36 Fund to the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Incentive Fund created by

39 section 3 of this act.
40 Sec. 5. 1. The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
41 (a) Section 9 of Article 8 of the Nevada Constitution contains a
42 provision commonly known as a “gift clause” which restricts the
43 State under certain circumstances from donating or loaning the
44 State’s money or credit to any company, association or corporation,
45 except corporations formed for educational or charitable purposes.

1 (b) In Employers Insurance Company of Nevada v. State Board
2 of Examiners, 117 Nev. 249, 258 (2001), the Nevada Supreme Court
3 held that the State loans its credit in violation of Section 9 of Article
4 8 of the Nevada Constitution only when “the State acts as a surety or
5 guarantor for the debts of a company, corporation or association.”
6 (c) In Lawrence v. Clark County, 127 Nev. 390, 399 (2011), the
7 Nevada Supreme Court held that the State does not donate, loan or
8 “gift” its money in violation of Section 9 of Article 8 of the Nevada
9 Constitution when the State dispenses state funds for a public
10 purpose and the State receives a valuable benefit or fair
11 consideration in exchange for the dispensation of the state funds.
12 (d) In State ex rel. Brennan v. Bowman, 89 Nev. 330, 333
13 (1973), the Nevada Supreme Court held that legislation which
14 promotes economic development and seeks to create, protect or
15 enhance job opportunities “inures to the public benefit” and serves
16 important public purposes because it assists in “relieving
17 unemployment and maintaining a stable economy.”
18 (e) In Lawrence v. Clark County, 127 Nev. 390, 399, 406
19 (2011), the Nevada Supreme Court adopted the public trust doctrine
20 in this State, noting that the public possesses inviolable rights to the
21 natural resources of the State and the State must serve as trustee of
22 the public resources and finding that the “constitutional policy
23 contained in the gift clause infers the people’s intent to constrain the
24 Legislature’s ability to alienate public trust lands as well as public
25 funds.”
26 (f) Section 3 of Article 9 of the Nevada Constitution restricts the
27 ability of the State to contract public debts, but makes an exception
28 for “any and all contracts necessary, expedient or advisable for the
29 protection and preservation of any of its property or natural
30 resources, or for the purposes of obtaining the benefits thereof,”
31 which further emphasizes the constitutionally mandated importance
32 of the protection and preservation of the natural resources of this
33 State.
34 (g) In McLaughlin v. Housing Authority of the City of Las
35 Vegas, 68 Nev. 84, 93 (1951) and Lawrence v. Clark County, 127
36 Nev. 390, 399 (2011), the Nevada Supreme Court held that when
37 the Legislature authorizes a state agency to dispense state funds, the
38 courts will:
39 (1) Carefully examine whether the Legislature made an
40 informed and appropriate finding that the dispensation of the state
41 funds serves a public purpose and the State receives a valuable
42 benefit or fair consideration in exchange for the dispensation;
43 (2) Give great weight and due deference to the Legislature’s
44 finding, and the courts will uphold the Legislature’s “finding unless
-
*AB481*

– 4 –
1 it clearly appears to be erroneous and without reasonable
2 foundation;” and
3 (3) Closely examine whether the dispensing state agency
4 reviews all facts, figures and necessary information when making
5 the dispensation, and when the state agency has done so, it will not
6 be second-guessed by the courts.
7 2. The Legislature hereby further finds and declares that:
8 (a) The release of greenhouse gases traps heat in the Earth’s
9 atmosphere, driving climate change.
10 (b) The United States Environmental Protection Agency has
11 concluded that certain large subsonic jet aircraft and subsonic
12 propeller driven airplanes that are used in all domestic and
13 international flights originating in the United States are responsible
14 for 10 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions from the
15 transportation sector in the United States and 3 percent of all
16 greenhouse gas emissions in the United States.
17 (c) According to the Federal Aviation Administration, about 10
18 percent of all aircraft emissions occur close to the surface of the
19 Earth near ground level and most particulate matter that affects
20 communities surrounding an airport are the result of emissions
21 released during landing and takeoff.
22 (d) Climate change threatens the health, lives and safety of
23 Nevada’s residents, as well as Nevada’s diverse ecosystems,
24 wildlands and wildlife. Rising temperatures have increased the
25 severity and length of droughts and the frequency and intensity of
26 wildfires.
27 (e) Climate change threatens Nevada’s economy. Rising
28 temperatures, compounded by the urban heat island effect, will
29 likely make summers in Southern Nevada dangerously hot,
30 potentially deterring visitors and reducing the hours when it is safe
31 to engage in outdoor activities, such as construction.
32 (f) Throughout this State, rising temperatures will impact public
33 health by increasing heat stress on vulnerable populations and
34 increasing air pollution from more frequent wildfires.
35 (g) The State of Nevada and its residents will benefit from the
36 diversification and economic growth driven by a transition to a low-
37 carbon emission aviation transportation sector.
38 3. The Legislature lastly finds and declares that:
39 (a) The state program developed and carried into effect pursuant
40 to this act will not result in the State acting as a surety or guarantor
41 of the debts of an air carrier receiving an incentive of money.
42 (b) The purpose of this act is to develop and carry into effect a
43 state program to encourage the production and purchase of
44 sustainable aviation fuel in this State for the purposes of:
-
*AB481*

– 5 –
1 (1) Developing the market and industry for sustainable
2 aviation fuel in this State and promoting jobs and businesses in this
3 State in the sustainable aviation fuel industry; and
4 (2) Reducing greenhouse gases emitted by domestic air
5 carriers that operate in this State, specifically emissions occurring
6 on takeoff and landing at airports in this State.
7 (c) The promotion and development of the sustainable fuel
8 industry in this State is an important public purpose which
9 incentivizes the development of business and industry in this State.
10 (d) The protection and preservation of the natural resources of
11 this State by incentivizing the purchase of sustainable aviation fuel
12 is an important public purpose which will limit the emissions of
13 greenhouse gasses from air carriers operating in this State and thus
14 lower the contributions air travel in this State make to climate
15 change, which threatens the health, safety and welfare of the
16 residents of this State and the economy of this State.
17 (e) The provisions of this act are intended to serve an important
18 public purpose and ensure that the State receives valuable benefits
19 and fair consideration in exchange for each incentive of money from
20 the program because:
21 (1) The program requires the dispensing agency to review all
22 facts, figures and necessary information when making each
23 incentive of money from the program to ensure the incentive meets
24 the requirements of the program;
25 (2) The promotion and development of the sustainable fuel
26 industry in this State and the protection and preservation of the
27 natural resources of this State are important public purposes that
28 promote job growth in this State and protect the health, safety and
29 welfare of the residents of this State; and
30 (3) The dispensing state agency may not make an incentive
31 of money from the program unless the air carrier purchases
32 sustainable aviation fuel in accordance with the requirements of the
33 program.
