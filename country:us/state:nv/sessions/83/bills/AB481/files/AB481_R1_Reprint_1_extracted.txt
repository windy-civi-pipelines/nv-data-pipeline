-
*AB481_R1*
– 2 –
1 applicable charges, be credited to the Fund. All claims against the
2 Fund must be paid as other claims against the State are paid.
3 3. The State Treasurer shall administer the Fund. The money
4 in the Fund must be used by the State Treasurer to carry out the
5 Sustainable Aviation Fuel Incentive Program created pursuant to
6 section 3 of this act.
7 4. The State Treasurer may apply for and accept gifts, grants,
8 donations, bequests and any other source of money available
9 under federal law and from private sources for deposit in the
10 Fund to carry out the provisions of the Sustainable Aviation Fuel
11 Incentive Program created by section 3 of this act.
12 Sec. 3. 1. The Sustainable Aviation Fuel Incentive
13 Program is hereby created for the purpose of providing incentives
14 of money for the purchase of sustainable aviation fuel produced in
15 this State.
16 2. A domestic air carrier based in the United States is eligible
17 to receive from the Program for the purchase of sustainable
18 aviation fuel produced in this State an incentive of $2.50 per
19 gallon.
20 3. A carrier that qualifies for an incentive from the Program
21 pursuant to subsection 2 may obtain an incentive by submitting a
22 claim to the State Treasurer. The State Treasurer shall review any
23 claim submitted pursuant to this subsection to confirm that the air
24 carrier qualifies for an incentive from the Program.
25 4. The State Treasurer may adopt regulations to carry out the
26 provisions of this section.
27 5. As used in this section:
28 (a) “Air carrier” means a person who provides commercial air
29 transportation to passengers.
30 (b) “Sustainable aviation fuel” means liquid fuel that meets
31 the criteria set forth in subsections (d) and (e) of 26 U.S.C. § 40B.
32 Sec. 4. There is hereby appropriated from the State General
33 Fund to the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Incentive Fund created by
34 section 2 of this act the sum of $10,000,000 to award incentives
35 from the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Incentive Program created by
36 section 3 of this act.
37 Sec. 5. 1. The Legislature hereby finds and declares that:
38 (a) Section 9 of Article 8 of the Nevada Constitution contains a
39 provision commonly known as a “gift clause” which restricts the
40 State under certain circumstances from donating or loaning the
41 State’s money or credit to any company, association or corporation,
42 except corporations formed for educational or charitable purposes.
43 (b) In Employers Insurance Company of Nevada v. State Board
44 of Examiners, 117 Nev. 249, 258 (2001), the Nevada Supreme Court
45 held that the State loans its credit in violation of Section 9 of Article
-
*AB481_R1*
– 3 –
1 8 of the Nevada Constitution only when “the State acts as a surety or
2 guarantor for the debts of a company, corporation or association.”
3 (c) In Lawrence v. Clark County, 127 Nev. 390, 399 (2011), the
4 Nevada Supreme Court held that the State does not donate, loan or
5 “gift” its money in violation of Section 9 of Article 8 of the Nevada
6 Constitution when the State dispenses state funds for a public
7 purpose and the State receives a valuable benefit or fair
8 consideration in exchange for the dispensation of the state funds.
9 (d) In State ex rel. Brennan v. Bowman, 89 Nev. 330, 333
10 (1973), the Nevada Supreme Court held that legislation which
11 promotes economic development and seeks to create, protect or
12 enhance job opportunities “inures to the public benefit” and serves
13 important public purposes because it assists in “relieving
14 unemployment and maintaining a stable economy.”
15 (e) In Lawrence v. Clark County, 127 Nev. 390, 399, 406
16 (2011), the Nevada Supreme Court adopted the public trust doctrine
17 in this State, noting that the public possesses inviolable rights to the
18 natural resources of the State and the State must serve as trustee of
19 the public resources and finding that the “constitutional policy
20 contained in the gift clause infers the people’s intent to constrain the
21 Legislature’s ability to alienate public trust lands as well as public
22 funds.”
23 (f) Section 3 of Article 9 of the Nevada Constitution restricts the
24 ability of the State to contract public debts, but makes an exception
25 for “any and all contracts necessary, expedient or advisable for the
26 protection and preservation of any of its property or natural
27 resources, or for the purposes of obtaining the benefits thereof,”
28 which further emphasizes the constitutionally mandated importance
29 of the protection and preservation of the natural resources of this
30 State.
31 (g) In McLaughlin v. Housing Authority of the City of Las
32 Vegas, 68 Nev. 84, 93 (1951) and Lawrence v. Clark County, 127
33 Nev. 390, 399 (2011), the Nevada Supreme Court held that when
34 the Legislature authorizes a state agency to dispense state funds, the
35 courts will:
36 (1) Carefully examine whether the Legislature made an
37 informed and appropriate finding that the dispensation of the state
38 funds serves a public purpose and the State receives a valuable
39 benefit or fair consideration in exchange for the dispensation;
40 (2) Give great weight and due deference to the Legislature’s
41 finding, and the courts will uphold the Legislature’s “finding unless
42 it clearly appears to be erroneous and without reasonable
43 foundation;” and
44 (3) Closely examine whether the dispensing state agency
45 reviews all facts, figures and necessary information when making
-
*AB481_R1*
– 4 –
1 the dispensation, and when the state agency has done so, it will not
2 be second-guessed by the courts.
3 2. The Legislature hereby further finds and declares that:
4 (a) The release of greenhouse gases traps heat in the Earth’s
5 atmosphere, driving climate change.
6 (b) The United States Environmental Protection Agency has
7 concluded that certain large subsonic jet aircraft and subsonic
8 propeller driven airplanes that are used in all domestic and
9 international flights originating in the United States are responsible
10 for 10 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions from the
11 transportation sector in the United States and 3 percent of all
12 greenhouse gas emissions in the United States.
13 (c) According to the Federal Aviation Administration, about 10
14 percent of all aircraft emissions occur close to the surface of the
15 Earth near ground level and most particulate matter that affects
16 communities surrounding an airport are the result of emissions
17 released during landing and takeoff.
18 (d) Climate change threatens the health, lives and safety of
19 Nevada’s residents, as well as Nevada’s diverse ecosystems,
20 wildlands and wildlife. Rising temperatures have increased the
21 severity and length of droughts and the frequency and intensity of
22 wildfires.
23 (e) Climate change threatens Nevada’s economy. Rising
24 temperatures, compounded by the urban heat island effect, will
25 likely make summers in Southern Nevada dangerously hot,
26 potentially deterring visitors and reducing the hours when it is safe
27 to engage in outdoor activities, such as construction.
28 (f) Throughout this State, rising temperatures will impact public
29 health by increasing heat stress on vulnerable populations and
30 increasing air pollution from more frequent wildfires.
31 (g) The State of Nevada and its residents will benefit from the
32 diversification and economic growth driven by a transition to a low-
33 carbon emission aviation transportation sector.
34 3. The Legislature lastly finds and declares that:
35 (a) The state program developed and carried into effect pursuant
36 to this act will not result in the State acting as a surety or guarantor
37 of the debts of an air carrier receiving an incentive of money.
38 (b) The purpose of this act is to develop and carry into effect a
39 state program to encourage the production and purchase of
40 sustainable aviation fuel in this State for the purposes of:
41 (1) Developing the market and industry for sustainable
42 aviation fuel in this State and promoting jobs and businesses in this
43 State in the sustainable aviation fuel industry; and
-
*AB481_R1*
– 5 –
1 (2) Reducing greenhouse gases emitted by domestic air
2 carriers that operate in this State, specifically emissions occurring
3 on takeoff and landing at airports in this State.
4 (c) The promotion and development of the sustainable fuel
5 industry in this State is an important public purpose which
6 incentivizes the development of business and industry in this State.
7 (d) The protection and preservation of the natural resources of
8 this State by incentivizing the purchase of sustainable aviation fuel
9 is an important public purpose which will limit the emissions of
10 greenhouse gasses from air carriers operating in this State and thus
11 lower the contributions air travel in this State make to climate
12 change, which threatens the health, safety and welfare of the
13 residents of this State and the economy of this State.
14 (e) The provisions of this act are intended to serve an important
15 public purpose and ensure that the State receives valuable benefits
16 and fair consideration in exchange for each incentive of money from
17 the program because:
18 (1) The program requires the dispensing agency to review all
19 facts, figures and necessary information when making each
20 incentive of money from the program to ensure the incentive meets
21 the requirements of the program;
22 (2) The promotion and development of the sustainable fuel
23 industry in this State and the protection and preservation of the
24 natural resources of this State are important public purposes that
25 promote job growth in this State and protect the health, safety and
26 welfare of the residents of this State; and
27 (3) The dispensing state agency may not make an incentive
28 of money from the program unless the air carrier purchases
29 sustainable aviation fuel in accordance with the requirements of the
30 program.
