Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth certain requirements relating to a written rental
2 agreement. Existing law requires any written agreement for the use and occupancy
3 of a dwelling unit or premises to contain provisions relating to the amount of rent
4 due and the manner and time of its payment. (NRS 118A.200) Section 4 of this bill
5 requires that, in each place where a landlord lists the amount of rent due under a
6 rental agreement and in any reference to the amount of rent due in a written rental
7 agreement, the rent must be set forth as a single figure representing the total amount

8 of periodic rent that includes the amount of any fixed, mandatory fees to be charged
9 to the tenant in addition to the base rent. Section 4 prohibits a landlord from
10 charging a tenant an amount for periodic rent that exceeds the amount of rent due
11 under the written rental agreement, as set forth in the manner required by section 4.
12 Section 3.5 of this bill requires a landlord or his or her agent, upon request, to
13 provide a prospective tenant with a copy of the written rental agreement, if any, to
14 which the prospective tenant would be subject if he or she were to become a tenant.
15 Section 2 of this bill requires a landlord to provide a tenant at least one method
16 to pay rent or any other fee or charge which does not require the tenant to: (1) pay
17 any fee or charge to use the method; or (2) provide information concerning a bank
18 account of the tenant. Section 2 also prohibits a landlord or his or her agent who
19 allows a tenant to pay rent or any other fee or charge through an Internet website or
20 online portal from charging the tenant a fee to make a payment through the Internet
21 website or online portal in an amount that exceeds the amount of any fee charged
22 for the use of the Internet website or online portal by the operator of the Internet
23 website or online portal. Section 2 requires the amount of any fee to be charged to
24 the tenant by the landlord or his or her agent for the use of an Internet website or
25 online portal to make a payment to be separately identified in any written rental
26 agreement.
27 Section 3 of this bill authorizes a tenant who is aggrieved by a violation of the
28 requirements of section 4 concerning the manner in which rent must be listed or
29 referenced in a written rental agreement or the prohibition set forth in section 4 on
30 charging a tenant an amount for periodic rent that exceeds the amount of rent due
31 under a written rental agreement to bring a civil action for such a violation. Section
32 3 requires a court to award certain relief to a tenant who prevails in such an action.
