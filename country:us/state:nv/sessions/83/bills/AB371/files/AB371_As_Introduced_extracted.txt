AN ACT relating to cosmetology; enacting the Cosmetology
Licensure Compact; providing cosmetologists practicing
in this State under the Compact with the same legal status
as persons who are licensed cosmetologists in this State;
authorizing the sharing of certain information with a data
system created by the Compact; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of cosmetologists in this
2 State by the State Board of Cosmetology. (Chapter 644A of NRS) Section 1 of this
3 bill enacts the Cosmetology Licensure Compact, which allows a person who is
4 licensed as a cosmetologist in a state which is a member of the Compact to obtain a
5 multistate license which authorizes the person to practice in other states that are
6 members of the Compact.
7 In order to obtain a multistate license authorizing a person to practice as a
8 cosmetologist under the Compact, the Compact requires a person to: (1) hold an
9 unencumbered license in a State that is a member of the Compact and which is the
10 primary residence of the person; (2) submit to an application process and pay any
11 applicable fees; (3) agree to abide by the rules of the State Board of Cosmetology
12 or other licensing authority in each state in which he or she seeks to practice; (4)
13 function within the scope of practice authorized by each state in which he or she
14 seeks to practice; and (5) meet certain other requirements for eligibility.
15 The Compact requires member states to create a joint government agency
16 called the Cosmetology Licensure Compact Commission. The Compact sets forth
17 the powers of the Commission which include, among other powers, the power to
18 adopt rules and bylaws and to hold meetings, which may be closed under certain
19 circumstances. The Compact additionally authorizes the Commission to levy and
20 collect an annual assessment from member states and impose fees upon persons
21 seeking to practice under the Compact to cover the cost of its operations.

22 The Compact requires the Commission to create a data system to facilitate the
23 sharing of information among member states. Section 2 of this bill, in general,
24 authorizes the State Board of Cosmetology to disclose information to that data
25 system when required by the Compact. Section 4 of this bill provides for the
26 confidentiality of certain information disclosed through the data system.
27 The Compact provides additional provisions to carry out the Compact,
28 including providing procedures for the taking of adverse actions against licensees,
29 provisions for rulemaking by the Commission, procedures for oversight, dispute
30 resolution and enforcement and procedures for amendments and withdrawals.
31 Section 3 of this bill deems practicing as a cosmetologist under the Compact to
32 be equivalent to practicing under a license issued by the State Board of
33 Cosmetology, thereby providing such persons with the same authority, duties and
34 legal protections as a licensee.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 644A of NRS is hereby amended by
2 adding thereto a new section to read as follows:

18 ARTICLE 11. RULEMAKING
19
20 A. The Commission shall promulgate reasonable Rules in
21 order to effectively and efficiently implement and administer the
22 purposes and provisions of the Compact. A Rule shall be invalid
23 and have no force or effect only if a court of competent

26 scope and purposes of the Compact, or the powers granted
27 hereunder, or based upon another applicable standard of review.
28 B. The Rules of the Commission shall have the force of law

33 jurisdiction, the Rules of the Commission shall be ineffective in
34 that State to the extent of the conflict.

40 rejects a Rule or portion of a Rule, by enactment of a statute or

32 all written comments and documents received by the Commission
33 in response to the proposed Rule shall be available to the public.
34 J. Nothing in this Article shall be construed as requiring a
35 separate hearing on each Rule. Rules may be grouped for the
36 convenience of the Commission at hearings required by this
37 Article.
38 K. The Commission shall, by majority vote of all members,
39 take final action on the proposed Rule based on the rulemaking

3 3. The Commission shall determine a reasonable effective
4 date for the Rule. Except for an emergency as provided in Article

24 purposes of correcting typographical errors, errors in format,
25 errors in consistency, or grammatical errors. Public notice of any
26 revisions shall be posted on the website of the Commission. The
27 revision shall be subject to challenge by any person for a period of
28 thirty (30) days after posting. The revision may be challenged only
29 on grounds that the revision results in a material change to a
30 Rule. A challenge shall be made in writing and delivered to the
31 Commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge
32 is made, the revision will take effect without further action. If the

3 of competent jurisdiction where the principal office of the
4 Commission is located. The Commission may waive venue and

6 participate in alternative dispute resolution proceedings. Nothing
7 herein shall affect or limit the selection or propriety of venue in
8 any action against a Licensee for professional malpractice,
9 misconduct or any such similar matter.
10 3. The Commission shall be entitled to receive service of
11 process in any proceeding regarding the enforcement or
12 interpretation of the Compact and shall have standing to intervene
13 in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide the
14 Commission service of process shall render a judgment or order
15 void as to the Commission, this Compact, or promulgated Rules.
16 B. Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination
17 1. If the Commission determines that a Member State has
18 defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities
19 under this Compact or the promulgated Rules, the Commission

24 regarding the default.
25 2. The Commission shall provide a copy of the notice of
26 default to the other Member States.
27 3. If a State in default fails to cure the default, the
28 defaulting State may be terminated from the Compact upon an
29 affirmative vote of a majority of the delegates of the Member
30 States, and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred on that
31 State by this Compact may be terminated on the effective date of
32 termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending
33 State of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of
34 default.
35 4. Termination of membership in the Compact shall be
36 imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have
37 been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be
38 given by the Commission to the governor, the majority and
39 minority leaders of the defaulting State’s legislature, the
40 defaulting State’s State Licensing Authority and each of the
41 Member States’ State Licensing Authority.
42 5. A State that has been terminated is responsible for all
43 assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the
44 effective date of termination, including obligations that extend
45 beyond the effective date of termination.

*AB371*
– 23 –
1 6. Upon the termination of a State’s membership from this
2 Compact, that State shall immediately provide notice to all
3 Licensees who hold a Multistate License within that State of such
4 termination. The terminated State shall continue to recognize all
5 licenses granted pursuant to this Compact for a minimum of one
6 hundred eighty (180) days after the date of said notice of
7 termination.
8 7. The Commission shall not bear any costs related to a
9 State that is found to be in default or that has been terminated
10 from the Compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the
11 Commission and the defaulting State.
12 8. The defaulting State may appeal the action of the
13 Commission by petitioning the United States District Court for the
14 District of Columbia or the federal district where the Commission
15 has its principal offices. The prevailing party shall be awarded all
16 costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees.
17 C. Dispute Resolution

19 attempt to resolve disputes related to the Compact that arise
20 among Member States and between Member and non-Member
21 States.
22 2. The Commission shall promulgate a Rule providing for
23 both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as
24 appropriate.

26 1. The Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its
27 discretion, shall enforce the provisions of this Compact and the
28 Commission’s Rules.
29 2. By majority vote as provided by Commission Rule, the
30 Commission may initiate legal action against a Member State in
31 default in the United States District Court for the District of
32 Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has its
33 principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the
34 Compact and its promulgated Rules. The relief sought may
35 include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial
36 enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all
37 costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees. The
38 remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the
39 Commission. The Commission may pursue any other remedies
40 available under federal or the defaulting Member State’s law.
41 3. A Member State may initiate legal action against the
42 Commission in the United States District Court for the District of
43 Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has its
44 principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the
45 Compact and its promulgated Rules. The relief sought may
-
*AB371*

1 include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial
2 enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all

7 of this Compact prior to the effective date of withdrawal.
8 3. Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from this
9 Compact, a State shall immediately provide notice of such
10 withdrawal to all Licensees within that State. Notwithstanding any
11 subsequent statutory enactment to the contrary, such withdrawing
12 State shall continue to recognize all licenses granted pursuant to
13 this Compact for a minimum of one hundred eighty (180) days
14 after the date of such notice of withdrawal.
15 C. Nothing contained in this Compact shall be construed to
16 invalidate or prevent any licensure agreement or other cooperative
17 arrangement between a Member State and a non-Member State
18 that does not conflict with the provisions of this Compact.
19 D. This Compact may be amended by the Member States. No
20 amendment to this Compact shall become effective and binding
21 upon any Member State until it is enacted into the laws of all
22 Member States.
23
24 ARTICLE 14. CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
25
26 A. This Compact and the Commission’s rulemaking authority
27 shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes, and
28 the implementation and administration of the Compact. Provisions
29 of the Compact expressly authorizing or requiring the
30 promulgation of Rules shall not be construed to limit the
31 Commission’s rulemaking authority solely for those purposes.
32 B. The provisions of this Compact shall be severable and if
33 any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this Compact is held
34 by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the
35 constitution of any Member State, a State seeking participation in
36 the Compact, or of the United States, or the applicability thereof to
37 any government, agency, person or circumstance is held to be
38 unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the validity
39 of the remainder of this Compact and the applicability thereof to
40 any other government, agency, person or circumstance shall not
41 be affected thereby.
42 C. Notwithstanding Article 14.B, the Commission may deny a
43 State’s participation in the Compact or, in accordance with the
44 requirements of Article 12, terminate a Member State’s
45 participation in the Compact, if it determines that a constitutional
-
*AB371*
– 26 –
1 requirement of a Member State is a material departure from the
2 Compact. Otherwise, if this Compact shall be held to be contrary
3 to the constitution of any Member State, the Compact shall remain
4 in full force and effect as to the remaining Member States and in
5 full force and effect as to the Member State affected as to all
6 severable matters.
7
8 ARTICLE 15. CONSISTENT EFFECT AND
9 CONFLICT WITH OTHER STATE LAWS
10
11 A. Nothing herein shall prevent or inhibit the enforcement of
12 any other law of a Member State that is not inconsistent with the
13 Compact.
14 B. Any laws, statutes, regulations, or other legal requirements
15 in a Member State in conflict with the Compact are superseded to
16 the extent of the conflict.
17 C. All permissible agreements between the Commission and
18 the Member States are binding in accordance with their terms.
19 Sec. 2. NRS 644A.870 is hereby amended to read as follows:
20 644A.870 1. Except as otherwise provided in this section and
21 NRS 239.0115, and section 1 of this act, a complaint filed with the
22 Board, all documents and other information filed with the complaint
23 and all documents and other information compiled as a result of an
24 investigation conducted to determine whether to initiate disciplinary
25 action against a person are confidential.
26 2. The charging document filed with the Board to initiate
27 disciplinary action pursuant to chapter 622A of NRS and all
28 documents and information considered by the Board when
29 determining whether to impose discipline are public records.
30 3. The Board shall, to the extent feasible, communicate or
31 cooperate with or provide any documents or other information to
32 any other licensing board or any other agency that is investigating a
33 person, including, without limitation, a law enforcement agency.
34 Sec. 3. The preliminary chapter of NRS is hereby amended by
35 adding thereto a new section to read as follows:
36 Except as otherwise expressly provided in a particular statute
37 or required by the context, authorization to practice as a
38 cosmetologist in this State under a multistate license issued under
39 the Cosmetology Licensure Compact ratified and entered into in
40 section 1 of this act shall be deemed to be equivalent to the
41 corresponding license.
42 Sec. 4. NRS 239.010 is hereby amended to read as follows:
43 239.010 1. Except as otherwise provided in this section and

29 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
30 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
31 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by
32 means of an electronic medium would:
33 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
34 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential
35 and that cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from
36 information that is not otherwise confidential.
37 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who

ASSEMBLY BILL NO. 371–ASSEMBLYMEMBER TORRES-FOSSETT
MARCH 6, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Commerce and Labor
SUMMARY—Enacts the Cosmetology Licensure Compact.
(BDR 54-835)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to cosmetology; enacting the Cosmetology
Licensure Compact; providing cosmetologists practicing
in this State under the Compact with the same legal status
as persons who are licensed cosmetologists in this State;
authorizing the sharing of certain information with a data
system created by the Compact; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of cosmetologists in this
2 State by the State Board of Cosmetology. (Chapter 644A of NRS) Section 1 of this
3 bill enacts the Cosmetology Licensure Compact, which allows a person who is
4 licensed as a cosmetologist in a state which is a member of the Compact to obtain a
5 multistate license which authorizes the person to practice in other states that are
6 members of the Compact.
7 In order to obtain a multistate license authorizing a person to practice as a
8 cosmetologist under the Compact, the Compact requires a person to: (1) hold an
9 unencumbered license in a State that is a member of the Compact and which is the
10 primary residence of the person; (2) submit to an application process and pay any
11 applicable fees; (3) agree to abide by the rules of the State Board of Cosmetology
12 or other licensing authority in each state in which he or she seeks to practice; (4)
13 function within the scope of practice authorized by each state in which he or she
14 seeks to practice; and (5) meet certain other requirements for eligibility.
15 The Compact requires member states to create a joint government agency
16 called the Cosmetology Licensure Compact Commission. The Compact sets forth
17 the powers of the Commission which include, among other powers, the power to
18 adopt rules and bylaws and to hold meetings, which may be closed under certain
19 circumstances. The Compact additionally authorizes the Commission to levy and
20 collect an annual assessment from member states and impose fees upon persons
21 seeking to practice under the Compact to cover the cost of its operations.

22 The Compact requires the Commission to create a data system to facilitate the
23 sharing of information among member states. Section 2 of this bill, in general,
24 authorizes the State Board of Cosmetology to disclose information to that data
25 system when required by the Compact. Section 4 of this bill provides for the
26 confidentiality of certain information disclosed through the data system.
27 The Compact provides additional provisions to carry out the Compact,
28 including providing procedures for the taking of adverse actions against licensees,
29 provisions for rulemaking by the Commission, procedures for oversight, dispute
30 resolution and enforcement and procedures for amendments and withdrawals.
31 Section 3 of this bill deems practicing as a cosmetologist under the Compact to
32 be equivalent to practicing under a license issued by the State Board of
33 Cosmetology, thereby providing such persons with the same authority, duties and
34 legal protections as a licensee.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 644A of NRS is hereby amended by
2 adding thereto a new section to read as follows:
3 The Cosmetology Licensure Compact is hereby ratified and

18 ARTICLE 11. RULEMAKING
19
20 A. The Commission shall promulgate reasonable Rules in
21 order to effectively and efficiently implement and administer the
22 purposes and provisions of the Compact. A Rule shall be invalid
23 and have no force or effect only if a court of competent
24 jurisdiction holds that the Rule is invalid because the Commission
25 exercised its rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond the
26 scope and purposes of the Compact, or the powers granted
27 hereunder, or based upon another applicable standard of review.
28 B. The Rules of the Commission shall have the force of law
29 in each Member State, provided however that where the Rules of
30 the Commission conflict with the laws of the Member State that
31 establish the Member State’s scope of practice laws governing the
32 Practice of Cosmetology as held by a court of competent
33 jurisdiction, the Rules of the Commission shall be ineffective in
34 that State to the extent of the conflict.
35 C. The Commission shall exercise its rulemaking powers
36 pursuant to the criteria set forth in this Article and the Rules
37 adopted thereunder. Rules shall become binding as of the date
38 specified by the Commission for each Rule.
39 D. If a majority of the legislatures of the Member States
40 rejects a Rule or portion of a Rule, by enactment of a statute or
41 resolution in the same manner used to adopt the Compact within
42 four (4) years of the date of adoption of the Rule, then such Rule
43 shall have no further force and effect in any Member State or to
44 any State applying to participate in the Compact.
-
*AB371*

– 20 –
1 E. Rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting of
2 the Commission.
3 F. Prior to adoption of a proposed Rule, the Commission
4 shall hold a public hearing and allow persons to provide oral and
5 written comments, data, facts, opinions, and arguments.
6 G. Prior to adoption of a proposed Rule by the Commission,
7 and at least thirty (30) days in advance of the meeting at which the
8 Commission will hold a public hearing on the proposed Rule, the
9 Commission shall provide a notice of proposed rulemaking:
10 1. On the website of the Commission or other publicly
11 accessible platform;
12 2. To persons who have requested notice of the
13 Commission’s notices of proposed rulemaking; and
14 3. In such other way(s) as the Commission may by Rule
15 specify.
16 H. The notice of proposed rulemaking shall include:
17 1. The time, date, and location of the public hearing at
18 which the Commission will hear public comments on the proposed
19 Rule and, if different, the time, date, and location of the meeting
20 where the Commission will consider and vote on the proposed
21 Rule;
22 2. If the hearing is held via telecommunication, video
23 conference, or other electronic means, the Commission shall
24 include the mechanism for access to the hearing in the notice of
25 proposed rulemaking;
26 3. The text of the proposed Rule and the reason therefor;
27 4. A request for comments on the proposed Rule from any
28 interested person; and
29 5. The manner in which interested persons may submit
30 written comments.
31 I. All hearings will be recorded. A copy of the recording and
32 all written comments and documents received by the Commission
33 in response to the proposed Rule shall be available to the public.
34 J. Nothing in this Article shall be construed as requiring a
35 separate hearing on each Rule. Rules may be grouped for the
36 convenience of the Commission at hearings required by this
37 Article.
38 K. The Commission shall, by majority vote of all members,
39 take final action on the proposed Rule based on the rulemaking
40 record and the full text of the Rule.
41 1. The Commission may adopt changes to the proposed
42 Rule provided the changes do not enlarge the original purpose of
43 the proposed Rule.
44 2. The Commission shall provide an explanation of the
45 reasons for substantive changes made to the proposed Rule as well
-
*AB371*

– 21 –
1 as reasons for substantive changes not made that were
2 recommended by commenters.
3 3. The Commission shall determine a reasonable effective
4 date for the Rule. Except for an emergency as provided in Article
5 11.L, the effective date of the Rule shall be no sooner than forty-
6 five (45) days after the Commission issuing the notice that it
7 adopted or amended the Rule.
8 L. Upon determination that an emergency exists, the
9 Commission may consider and adopt an emergency Rule with five
10 (5) days’ notice, with opportunity to comment, provided that the
11 usual rulemaking procedures provided in the Compact and in this
12 Article shall be retroactively applied to the Rule as soon as
13 reasonably possible, in no event later than ninety (90) days after
14 the effective date of the Rule. For the purposes of this provision,
15 an emergency Rule is one that must be adopted immediately to:
16 1. Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or
17 welfare;
18 2. Prevent a loss of Commission or Member State funds;
19 3. Meet a deadline for the promulgation of a Rule that is
20 established by federal law or rule; or
21 4. Protect public health and safety.
22 M. The Commission or an authorized committee of the
23 Commission may direct revisions to a previously adopted Rule for
24 purposes of correcting typographical errors, errors in format,
25 errors in consistency, or grammatical errors. Public notice of any
26 revisions shall be posted on the website of the Commission. The
27 revision shall be subject to challenge by any person for a period of
28 thirty (30) days after posting. The revision may be challenged only
29 on grounds that the revision results in a material change to a
30 Rule. A challenge shall be made in writing and delivered to the
31 Commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge
32 is made, the revision will take effect without further action. If the
33 revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect without the
34 approval of the Commission.
35 N. No Member State’s rulemaking requirements shall apply
36 under this Compact.
37
38 ARTICLE 12. OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION,
39 AND ENFORCEMENT
40
41 A. Oversight
42 1. The executive and judicial branches of State government
43 in each Member State shall enforce this Compact and take all
44 actions necessary and appropriate to implement the Compact.
-
*AB371*

– 22 –
1 2. Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or against
2 the Commission shall be brought solely and exclusively in a court
3 of competent jurisdiction where the principal office of the
4 Commission is located. The Commission may waive venue and
5 jurisdictional defenses to the extent it adopts or consents to
6 participate in alternative dispute resolution proceedings. Nothing
7 herein shall affect or limit the selection or propriety of venue in
8 any action against a Licensee for professional malpractice,
9 misconduct or any such similar matter.
10 3. The Commission shall be entitled to receive service of
11 process in any proceeding regarding the enforcement or
12 interpretation of the Compact and shall have standing to intervene
13 in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide the
14 Commission service of process shall render a judgment or order
15 void as to the Commission, this Compact, or promulgated Rules.
16 B. Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination
17 1. If the Commission determines that a Member State has
18 defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities
19 under this Compact or the promulgated Rules, the Commission
20 shall provide written notice to the defaulting State. The notice of
21 default shall describe the default, the proposed means of curing
22 the default, and any other action that the Commission may take,
23 and shall offer training and specific technical assistance
24 regarding the default.
25 2. The Commission shall provide a copy of the notice of
26 default to the other Member States.
27 3. If a State in default fails to cure the default, the
28 defaulting State may be terminated from the Compact upon an
29 affirmative vote of a majority of the delegates of the Member
30 States, and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred on that
31 State by this Compact may be terminated on the effective date of
32 termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending
33 State of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of
34 default.
35 4. Termination of membership in the Compact shall be
36 imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have
37 been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be
38 given by the Commission to the governor, the majority and
39 minority leaders of the defaulting State’s legislature, the
40 defaulting State’s State Licensing Authority and each of the
41 Member States’ State Licensing Authority.
42 5. A State that has been terminated is responsible for all
43 assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the
44 effective date of termination, including obligations that extend
45 beyond the effective date of termination.
-
*AB371*

– 23 –
1 6. Upon the termination of a State’s membership from this
2 Compact, that State shall immediately provide notice to all
3 Licensees who hold a Multistate License within that State of such
4 termination. The terminated State shall continue to recognize all
5 licenses granted pursuant to this Compact for a minimum of one
6 hundred eighty (180) days after the date of said notice of
7 termination.
8 7. The Commission shall not bear any costs related to a
9 State that is found to be in default or that has been terminated
10 from the Compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the
11 Commission and the defaulting State.
12 8. The defaulting State may appeal the action of the
13 Commission by petitioning the United States District Court for the
14 District of Columbia or the federal district where the Commission
15 has its principal offices. The prevailing party shall be awarded all
16 costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees.
17 C. Dispute Resolution
18 1. Upon request by a Member State, the Commission shall
19 attempt to resolve disputes related to the Compact that arise
20 among Member States and between Member and non-Member
21 States.
22 2. The Commission shall promulgate a Rule providing for
23 both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as
24 appropriate.
25 D. Enforcement
26 1. The Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its
27 discretion, shall enforce the provisions of this Compact and the
28 Commission’s Rules.
29 2. By majority vote as provided by Commission Rule, the
30 Commission may initiate legal action against a Member State in
31 default in the United States District Court for the District of
32 Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has its
33 principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the
34 Compact and its promulgated Rules. The relief sought may
35 include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial
36 enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all
37 costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees. The
38 remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the
39 Commission. The Commission may pursue any other remedies
40 available under federal or the defaulting Member State’s law.
41 3. A Member State may initiate legal action against the
42 Commission in the United States District Court for the District of
43 Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has its
44 principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the
45 Compact and its promulgated Rules. The relief sought may
-
*AB371*

– 24 –
1 include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial
2 enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all
3 costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees.
4 4. No individual or entity other than a Member State may
5 enforce this Compact against the Commission.

8 AND AMENDMENT
9
10 A. The Compact shall come into effect on the date on which
11 the Compact statute is enacted into law in the seventh Member
12 State.
13 1. On or after the effective date of the Compact, the
14 Commission shall convene and review the enactment of each of
15 the Charter Member States to determine if the statute enacted by
16 each such Charter Member State is materially different than the
17 model Compact statute.
18 a. A Charter Member State whose enactment is found to
19 be materially different from the model Compact statute shall be
20 entitled to the default process set forth in Article 12.
21 b. If any Member State is later found to be in default, or
22 is terminated or withdraws from the Compact, the Commission
23 shall remain in existence and the Compact shall remain in effect
24 even if the number of Member States should be less than
25 seven (7).
26 2. Member States enacting the Compact subsequent to the
27 Charter Member States shall be subject to the process set forth in
28 Article 9.C.24 to determine if their enactments are materially
29 different from the model Compact statute and whether they qualify
30 for participation in the Compact.
31 3. All actions taken for the benefit of the Commission or in
32 furtherance of the purposes of the administration of the Compact
33 prior to the effective date of the Compact or the Commission
34 coming into existence shall be considered to be actions of the
35 Commission unless specifically repudiated by the Commission.
36 4. Any State that joins the Compact shall be subject to the
37 Commission’s Rules and bylaws as they exist on the date on which
38 the Compact becomes law in that State. Any Rule that has been
39 previously adopted by the Commission shall have the full force
40 and effect of law on the day the Compact becomes law in that
41 State.
42 B. Any Member State may withdraw from this Compact by
43 enacting a statute repealing that State’s enactment of the
44 Compact.
-
*AB371*

– 25 –
1 1. A Member State’s withdrawal shall not take effect until
2 one hundred eighty (180) days after enactment of the repealing
3 statute.
4 2. Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement
5 of the withdrawing State’s State Licensing Authority to comply
6 with the investigative and Adverse Action reporting requirements
7 of this Compact prior to the effective date of withdrawal.
8 3. Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from this
9 Compact, a State shall immediately provide notice of such
10 withdrawal to all Licensees within that State. Notwithstanding any
11 subsequent statutory enactment to the contrary, such withdrawing
12 State shall continue to recognize all licenses granted pursuant to
13 this Compact for a minimum of one hundred eighty (180) days
14 after the date of such notice of withdrawal.
15 C. Nothing contained in this Compact shall be construed to
16 invalidate or prevent any licensure agreement or other cooperative
17 arrangement between a Member State and a non-Member State
18 that does not conflict with the provisions of this Compact.
19 D. This Compact may be amended by the Member States. No
20 amendment to this Compact shall become effective and binding
21 upon any Member State until it is enacted into the laws of all
22 Member States.
23
24 ARTICLE 14. CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
25
26 A. This Compact and the Commission’s rulemaking authority
27 shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes, and
28 the implementation and administration of the Compact. Provisions
29 of the Compact expressly authorizing or requiring the
30 promulgation of Rules shall not be construed to limit the
31 Commission’s rulemaking authority solely for those purposes.
32 B. The provisions of this Compact shall be severable and if
33 any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this Compact is held
34 by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the
35 constitution of any Member State, a State seeking participation in
36 the Compact, or of the United States, or the applicability thereof to
37 any government, agency, person or circumstance is held to be
38 unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the validity
39 of the remainder of this Compact and the applicability thereof to
40 any other government, agency, person or circumstance shall not
41 be affected thereby.
42 C. Notwithstanding Article 14.B, the Commission may deny a
43 State’s participation in the Compact or, in accordance with the
44 requirements of Article 12, terminate a Member State’s
45 participation in the Compact, if it determines that a constitutional
-
*AB371*

– 26 –
1 requirement of a Member State is a material departure from the
2 Compact. Otherwise, if this Compact shall be held to be contrary
3 to the constitution of any Member State, the Compact shall remain
4 in full force and effect as to the remaining Member States and in
5 full force and effect as to the Member State affected as to all
6 severable matters.
7
8 ARTICLE 15. CONSISTENT EFFECT AND
9 CONFLICT WITH OTHER STATE LAWS
10
11 A. Nothing herein shall prevent or inhibit the enforcement of
12 any other law of a Member State that is not inconsistent with the
13 Compact.
14 B. Any laws, statutes, regulations, or other legal requirements
15 in a Member State in conflict with the Compact are superseded to
16 the extent of the conflict.
17 C. All permissible agreements between the Commission and
18 the Member States are binding in accordance with their terms.

22 Board, all documents and other information filed with the complaint
23 and all documents and other information compiled as a result of an
24 investigation conducted to determine whether to initiate disciplinary
25 action against a person are confidential.
26 2. The charging document filed with the Board to initiate
27 disciplinary action pursuant to chapter 622A of NRS and all
28 documents and information considered by the Board when
29 determining whether to impose discipline are public records.
30 3. The Board shall, to the extent feasible, communicate or
31 cooperate with or provide any documents or other information to
32 any other licensing board or any other agency that is investigating a
33 person, including, without limitation, a law enforcement agency.
34 Sec. 3. The preliminary chapter of NRS is hereby amended by
35 adding thereto a new section to read as follows:
36 Except as otherwise expressly provided in a particular statute
37 or required by the context, authorization to practice as a
38 cosmetologist in this State under a multistate license issued under
39 the Cosmetology Licensure Compact ratified and entered into in
40 section 1 of this act shall be deemed to be equivalent to the
41 corresponding license.
42 Sec. 4. NRS 239.010 is hereby amended to read as follows:
43 239.010 1. Except as otherwise provided in this section and

29 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
30 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
31 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by
32 means of an electronic medium would:
33 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
34 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential
35 and that cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from
36 information that is not otherwise confidential.
37 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who
