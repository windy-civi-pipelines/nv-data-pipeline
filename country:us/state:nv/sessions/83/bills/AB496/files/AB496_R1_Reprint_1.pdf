Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes a county clerk to cause to be published in a newspaper
2 circulated in the county an alphabetical listing of all registered voters. (NRS
3 293.557) Section 3 of this bill requires, on the first business day of each month,
4 each county clerk to publish on the Internet website of the county clerk an
5 alphabetical listing of all registered voters in the county. Section 3 further requires
6 that the county clerk ensure that the alphabetical listing may be downloaded by any
7 person free of charge. Section 6 of this bill makes a conforming change to require
8 the county clerk to include the identification number of a registered voter on the list
9 required by section 3, similar to the inclusion of the identification number on other
10 lists of registered voters made available for public inspection.
11 Existing law requires, with certain exceptions, the county or city clerk to send
12 to each active registered voter certain information relating to voting by mail,
13 including a mail ballot and a return envelope. (NRS 293.269913, 293C.26312)
14 Sections 4 and 9 of this bill require that the return envelope include: (1) the initials
15 of the voter in print; and (2) a space for the voter to write his or her telephone

16 number for purposes of contacting the voter, if necessary, for signature curing or
17 verification.
18 Sections 2 and 8 of this bill require each county and city clerk, respectively, to
19 post on the Internet website of the county or city clerk, as applicable, certain
20 information relating to mail ballots and provisional ballots starting on the day after
21 the period of early voting by personal appearance begins and ending on the day
22 after the election results are canvassed. Sections 2 and 8 also require the Secretary
23 of State to post on the Internet website of the Secretary of State a compilation of
24 such information.
25 Existing federal law requires that access to information about an individual
26 provisional ballot be restricted to the individual who cast the ballot. (52 U.S.C. §
27 21082) Existing state law requires that access to information concerning a
28 provisional ballot be restricted to the person who cast the ballot. (NRS 293.3086,
29 293.5882) Sections 5 and 7 of this bill revise these provisions to specify that access
30 to information concerning an individual provisional ballot must be restricted.
