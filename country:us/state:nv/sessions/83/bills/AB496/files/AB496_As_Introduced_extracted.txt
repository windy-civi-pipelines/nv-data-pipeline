10 lists of registered voters made available for public inspection.
11 Existing law requires, with certain exceptions, the county or city clerk to send
12 to each active registered voter certain information relating to voting by mail,

25 Existing federal law requires that access to information about an individual
26 provisional ballot be restricted to the individual who cast the ballot. (52 U.S.C. §
