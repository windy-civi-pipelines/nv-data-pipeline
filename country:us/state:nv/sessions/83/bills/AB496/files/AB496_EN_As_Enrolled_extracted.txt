Assembly Bill No. 496–Assemblymember Yeager
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to elections; requiring county and city clerks and
the Secretary of State to post on the Internet certain
information relating to mail ballots and provisional ballots;
requiring each county clerk to post monthly on the Internet an
alphabetical listing of all registered voters in the county;
requiring certain information to be included on the return
envelopes for mail ballots; revising provisions relating to
access to information concerning provisional ballots; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law authorizes a county clerk to cause to be published in a newspaper
circulated in the county an alphabetical listing of all registered voters. (NRS
293.557) Section 3 of this bill requires, on the first business day of each month,
each county clerk to publish on the Internet website of the county clerk an
alphabetical listing of all registered voters in the county. Section 3 further requires
that the county clerk ensure that the alphabetical listing may be downloaded by any
person free of charge. Section 6 of this bill makes a conforming change to require
the county clerk to include the identification number of a registered voter on the list
required by section 3, similar to the inclusion of the identification number on other
lists of registered voters made available for public inspection.
Existing law requires, with certain exceptions, the county or city clerk to send
to each active registered voter certain information relating to voting by mail,
including a mail ballot and a return envelope. (NRS 293.269913, 293C.26312)
Sections 4 and 9 of this bill require that the return envelope include a space for the
voter to write his or her telephone number for purposes of contacting the voter, if
necessary, for signature curing or verification.
Sections 2 and 8 of this bill require each county and city clerk, respectively, to
post on the Internet website of the county or city clerk, as applicable, certain
information relating to mail ballots and provisional ballots starting on the day after
the period of early voting by personal appearance begins and ending on the day
after the election results are canvassed. Sections 2 and 8 also require the Secretary
of State to post on the Internet website of the Secretary of State: (1) a compilation
of such information; and (2) an estimate of the total number of mail ballots that are
in the custody of the United States Postal Service. Sections 2 and 8 further require
the Secretary of State to adopt by regulation the: (1) specific categories of defects
in signatures that require curing by registered voters; and (2) process for reporting
the information relating to provisional ballots that is required to be reported by the
county and city clerks.
Existing federal law requires that access to information about an individual
provisional ballot be restricted to the individual who cast the ballot. (52 U.S.C. §
21082) Existing state law requires that access to information concerning a
provisional ballot be restricted to the person who cast the ballot. (NRS 293.3086,
293.5882) Sections 5 and 7 of this bill revise these provisions to specify that access
to information concerning an individual provisional ballot must be restricted.
