10 lists of registered voters made available for public inspection.

12 to each active registered voter certain information relating to voting by mail,
13 including a mail ballot and a return envelope. (NRS 293.269913, 293C.26312)

17 Sections 2 and 8 of this bill require each county and city clerk, respectively, to

26 in signatures that require curing by registered voters; and (2) process for reporting
27 the information relating to provisional ballots that is required to be reported by the
28 county and city clerks.
29 Existing federal law requires that access to information about an individual
30 provisional ballot be restricted to the individual who cast the ballot. (52 U.S.C. §
31 21082) Existing state law requires that access to information concerning a
32 provisional ballot be restricted to the person who cast the ballot. (NRS 293.3086,

17 Sections 2 and 8 of this bill require each county and city clerk, respectively, to
18 post on the Internet website of the county or city clerk, as applicable, certain
19 information relating to mail ballots and provisional ballots starting on the day after

26 in signatures that require curing by registered voters; and (2) process for reporting
27 the information relating to provisional ballots that is required to be reported by the
