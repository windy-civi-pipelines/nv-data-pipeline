EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to elections; requiring county and city clerks and the Secretary of
State to post on the Internet certain information relating to mail ballots
and provisional ballots; requiring each county clerk to post monthly on
the Internet an alphabetical listing of all registered voters in the county;
requiring certain information to be included on the return envelopes for
mail ballots; revising provisions relating to access to information
concerning provisional ballots; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes a county clerk to cause to be published in a newspaper circulated
2 in the county an alphabetical listing of all registered voters. (NRS 293.557) Section 3 of this
3 bill requires, on the first business day of each month, each county clerk to publish on the
4 Internet website of the county clerk an alphabetical listing of all registered voters in the
5 county. Section 3 further requires that the county clerk ensure that the alphabetical listing may
6 be downloaded by any person free of charge. Section 6 of this bill makes a conforming
7 change to require the county clerk to include the identification number of a registered voter on
8 the list required by section 3, similar to the inclusion of the identification number on other
9 lists of registered voters made available for public inspection.
10 Existing law requires, with certain exceptions, the county or city clerk to send to each
11 active registered voter certain information relating to voting by mail, including a mail ballot
12 and a return envelope. (NRS 293.269913, 293C.26312) Sections 4 and 9 of this bill require
13 that the return envelope include: (1) the [name] initials of the voter in print; and (2) a space
14 for the voter to write his or her telephone number for purposes of contacting the voter, if
15 necessary, for signature curing or verification.
16 Sections 2 and 8 of this bill require each county and city clerk, respectively, to post on
17 the Internet website of the county or city clerk, as applicable, certain information relating to
18 mail ballots and provisional ballots starting on the day after the period of early voting by
19 personal appearance begins and ending on the day after the election results are canvassed.
20 Sections 2 and 8 also require the Secretary of State to post on the Internet website of the
21 Secretary of State a compilation of such information.
22 Existing federal law requires that access to information about an individual provisional
23 ballot be restricted to the individual who cast the ballot. (52 U.S.C. § 21082) Existing state
Assembly Amendment No. 384 to Assembly Bill No. 496 Page 4
24 law requires that access to information concerning a provisional ballot be restricted to the
25 person who cast the ballot. (NRS 293.3086, 293.5882) Sections 5 and 7 of this bill revise
26 these provisions to specify that access to information concerning an individual provisional
27 ballot must be restricted.

AN ACT relating to elections; requiring county and city clerks and the Secretary of

3 bill requires, on the first business day of each month, each county clerk to publish on the

7 change to require the county clerk to include the identification number of a registered voter on
8 the list required by section 3, similar to the inclusion of the identification number on other
9 lists of registered voters made available for public inspection.
10 Existing law requires, with certain exceptions, the county or city clerk to send to each
11 active registered voter certain information relating to voting by mail, including a mail ballot
12 and a return envelope. (NRS 293.269913, 293C.26312) Sections 4 and 9 of this bill require
13 that the return envelope include: (1) the [name] initials of the voter in print; and (2) a space
14 for the voter to write his or her telephone number for purposes of contacting the voter, if
15 necessary, for signature curing or verification.
16 Sections 2 and 8 of this bill require each county and city clerk, respectively, to post on
17 the Internet website of the county or city clerk, as applicable, certain information relating to
18 mail ballots and provisional ballots starting on the day after the period of early voting by
19 personal appearance begins and ending on the day after the election results are canvassed.
20 Sections 2 and 8 also require the Secretary of State to post on the Internet website of the
21 Secretary of State a compilation of such information.
22 Existing federal law requires that access to information about an individual provisional
23 ballot be restricted to the individual who cast the ballot. (52 U.S.C. § 21082) Existing state

Assembly Amendment No. 384 to Assembly Bill No. 496 Page 4
24 law requires that access to information concerning a provisional ballot be restricted to the
25 person who cast the ballot. (NRS 293.3086, 293.5882) Sections 5 and 7 of this bill revise
26 these provisions to specify that access to information concerning an individual provisional
27 ballot must be restricted.
