Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Section 4 of this bill requires the superintendent of each school district to
2 designate an administrator to serve in a role supporting pupils who are English
3 learners for the school district. Section 4 also prescribes the qualifications and
4 duties of any such person.
5 Existing law requires the principal of each school, in consultation with the
6 employees of the school, to prepare a plan to improve the achievement of pupils
7 enrolled in the school. (NRS 385A.650) Section 2 of this bill requires the principal
8 of a school to consult with the administrator designated pursuant to section 4 in
9 preparing or revising the plan. Section 2 requires such a plan to include methods
10 for closing gaps in achievement, if any, between different demographics of pupils
11 enrolled in the school. If at least 10 percent of the pupils enrolled in the school are
12 English learners, section 2 requires such a plan to: (1) make closing gaps in
13 achievement, if any, between pupils who are English learners and pupils who are
14 proficient in English the primary goal of the plan; and (2) include certain
15 quantitative goals and specific actions for improvement in the achievement of
16 pupils who are English learners. Section 1 of this bill makes a conforming change
17 to reflect the renumbering of subsections by section 2.
18 Section 5 of this bill requires the board of trustees of each school district to
19 ensure that each licensed teacher employed by the school district receives training
20 concerning English language acquisition. Section 5 also requires the Department of
21 Education to develop and provide guidance to each school district concerning the
22 training required by section 5. Section 12 of this bill requires a teacher employed
23 by a school district to submit proof of completion of the training required by
24 section 5 on or before October 1, 2030, as a condition of continued employment
25 after that date.
26 Section 6 of this bill requires data collected and maintained in the statewide
27 system of accountability for public schools concerning pupils who are English
28 learners to be disaggregated into certain subcategories, as designated by regulation
29 of the State Board of Education. Section 6 also provides that, notwithstanding any
30 other provision of law, any pupil achievement data concerning a pupil who is a
31 newcomer to the English language, as designated by regulation of the State Board,
32 must not negatively impact the performance rating of: (1) the school in which the
33 pupil is enrolled; (2) the school district in which the school is located; or (3) any
34 employee of the school in which the pupil is enrolled or school district in which the
35 school is located.
36 Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district to: (1)
37 develop a policy to teach English to pupils who are English learners; and (2) adopt
38 a plan to ensure that the policy achieves certain objectives. (NRS 388.407) Section
39 10 of this bill requires the policy to provide that a pupil who is a newcomer to the
40 English language, as designated by regulation of the State Board, may remain in
41 high school for not more than 10 semesters after the date on which the pupil was
42 otherwise scheduled to graduate or until the pupil is 21 years of age, whichever is
43 earlier. Section 10 also requires the Department to consult with the administrator
44 designated pursuant to section 4 in monitoring the implementation of the policy
45 and plan.
46 Section 11 of this bill requires the Department to establish an English Learner
47 Advisory Council in the 2025-2026 interim to study policies to support English
48 language acquisition, development and literacy. Section 11 also: (1) prescribes the
49 membership and duties of the Advisory Council; (2) requires the Department to
50 submit a written report describing the activities, findings, conclusions and
51 recommendations of the Advisory Council for transmittal to the 84th Session of the
52 Legislature; and (3) authorizes the Advisory Council to request the drafting of not
53 more than 1 legislative measure for prefiling on or before the first day of the regular
54 session of the Legislature in 2027.

55 Section 14 of this bill repeals an existing law which requires the principals of
56 certain schools that demonstrate low achievement for pupils who are English
57 learners to establish a corrective action plan. (NRS 388.408) Sections 7-9 of this
58 bill make conforming changes by removing references to the statute repealed by
59 section 14.
