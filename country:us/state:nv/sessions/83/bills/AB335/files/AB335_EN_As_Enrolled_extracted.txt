Legislative Counsel’s Digest:

Section 2:
Section 4 of this bill requires the superintendent of each school district to
designate an administrator to serve in a role supporting pupils who are English
learners for the school district. Section 4 also prescribes the qualifications and
duties of any such person.
Existing law requires the principal of each school, in consultation with the
employees of the school, to prepare a plan to improve the achievement of pupils
enrolled in the school. (NRS 385A.650) Section 2 of this bill requires the principal
of a school to consult with the administrator designated pursuant to section 4 in
preparing or revising the plan. Section 2 requires such a plan to include methods
for closing gaps in achievement, if any, between different demographics of pupils
enrolled in the school. If at least 10 percent of the pupils enrolled in the school are
English learners, section 2 requires such a plan to: (1) make closing gaps in
achievement, if any, between pupils who are English learners and pupils who are
proficient in English the primary goal of the plan; and (2) include certain
quantitative goals and specific actions for improvement in the achievement of
pupils who are English learners. Section 1 of this bill makes a conforming change
to reflect the renumbering of subsections by section 2.

Section 3:
Section 5 of this bill requires the board of trustees of each school district to
ensure that each licensed teacher employed by the school district receives training
concerning English language acquisition. Section 5 also requires the Department of

by a school district to submit proof of completion of the training required by

Section 4:
section 5 on or before October 1, 2030, as a condition of continued employment
after that date.

Section 5:
Section 6 of this bill requires data collected and maintained in the statewide
system of accountability for public schools concerning pupils who are English
learners to be disaggregated into certain subcategories, as designated by regulation
of the State Board of Education. Section 6 also provides that, notwithstanding any
other provision of law, any pupil achievement data concerning a pupil who is a
newcomer to the English language, as designated by regulation of the State Board,
must not negatively impact the performance rating of: (1) the school in which the
pupil is enrolled; (2) the school district in which the school is located; or (3) any
employee of the school in which the pupil is enrolled or school district in which the
school is located.
Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district to: (1)
develop a policy to teach English to pupils who are English learners; and (2) adopt
a plan to ensure that the policy achieves certain objectives. (NRS 388.407) Section
10 of this bill requires the policy to provide that a pupil who is a newcomer to the
English language, as designated by regulation of the State Board, may remain in
high school for not more than 10 semesters after the date on which the pupil was
otherwise scheduled to graduate or until the pupil is 21 years of age, whichever is
earlier. Section 10 also requires the Department to consult with the administrator
designated pursuant to section 4 in monitoring the implementation of the policy
and plan.

Section 6:
Section 11 of this bill requires the Department to establish an English Learner
Advisory Council in the 2025-2026 interim to study policies to support English
language acquisition, development and literacy. Section 11 also: (1) prescribes the
membership and duties of the Advisory Council; (2) requires the Department to
submit a written report describing the activities, findings, conclusions and
recommendations of the Advisory Council for transmittal to the 84th Session of the
Legislature; and (3) authorizes the Advisory Council to request the drafting of not
more than 1 legislative measure for prefiling on or before the first day of the regular
session of the Legislature in 2027.

Section 7:
Section 14 of this bill repeals an existing law which requires the principals of
certain schools that demonstrate low achievement for pupils who are English
learners to establish a corrective action plan. (NRS 388.408) Sections 7-9 of this
bill make conforming changes by removing references to the statute repealed by

Section 8:
section 14.

Raw Text:
Assembly Bill No. 335–Assemblymembers Torres-Fossett, Watts,
D’Silva; Dalia, Koenig and Moore
Joint Sponsors: Senators Buck,
Doñate, Nguyen; and Taylor
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to education; revising requirements for a plan to
improve the achievement of pupils enrolled in a public school;
requiring the superintendent of each school district to appoint an
administrator to serve in a role supporting pupils who are
English learners; requiring the board of trustees of a school
district to ensure that each licensed teacher receives training
concerning English language acquisition; requiring the
Department of Education to provide certain guidance to the
board of trustees of a school district; revising provisions
governing certain data collected and maintained in the statewide
system of accountability for public schools; prohibiting certain
pupil achievement data from negatively impacting the
performance rating of certain schools, school districts and
employees; requiring the Department to establish an English
Learner Advisory Council during the 2025-2026 interim to
study policies to support English language acquisition,
development and literacy; prescribing the membership and
duties of the Advisory Council; repealing provisions relating to
certain corrective action plans; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Section 4 of this bill requires the superintendent of each school district to
designate an administrator to serve in a role supporting pupils who are English
learners for the school district. Section 4 also prescribes the qualifications and
duties of any such person.
Existing law requires the principal of each school, in consultation with the
employees of the school, to prepare a plan to improve the achievement of pupils
enrolled in the school. (NRS 385A.650) Section 2 of this bill requires the principal
of a school to consult with the administrator designated pursuant to section 4 in
preparing or revising the plan. Section 2 requires such a plan to include methods
for closing gaps in achievement, if any, between different demographics of pupils
enrolled in the school. If at least 10 percent of the pupils enrolled in the school are
English learners, section 2 requires such a plan to: (1) make closing gaps in
achievement, if any, between pupils who are English learners and pupils who are
proficient in English the primary goal of the plan; and (2) include certain
quantitative goals and specific actions for improvement in the achievement of
pupils who are English learners. Section 1 of this bill makes a conforming change
to reflect the renumbering of subsections by section 2.
Section 5 of this bill requires the board of trustees of each school district to
ensure that each licensed teacher employed by the school district receives training
concerning English language acquisition. Section 5 also requires the Department of
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 2 –
Education to develop and provide guidance to each school district concerning the
training required by section 5. Section 12 of this bill requires a teacher employed
by a school district to submit proof of completion of the training required by
section 5 on or before October 1, 2030, as a condition of continued employment
after that date.
Section 6 of this bill requires data collected and maintained in the statewide
system of accountability for public schools concerning pupils who are English
learners to be disaggregated into certain subcategories, as designated by regulation
of the State Board of Education. Section 6 also provides that, notwithstanding any
other provision of law, any pupil achievement data concerning a pupil who is a
newcomer to the English language, as designated by regulation of the State Board,
must not negatively impact the performance rating of: (1) the school in which the
pupil is enrolled; (2) the school district in which the school is located; or (3) any
employee of the school in which the pupil is enrolled or school district in which the
school is located.
Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district to: (1)
develop a policy to teach English to pupils who are English learners; and (2) adopt
a plan to ensure that the policy achieves certain objectives. (NRS 388.407) Section
10 of this bill requires the policy to provide that a pupil who is a newcomer to the
English language, as designated by regulation of the State Board, may remain in
high school for not more than 10 semesters after the date on which the pupil was
otherwise scheduled to graduate or until the pupil is 21 years of age, whichever is
earlier. Section 10 also requires the Department to consult with the administrator
designated pursuant to section 4 in monitoring the implementation of the policy
and plan.
Section 11 of this bill requires the Department to establish an English Learner
Advisory Council in the 2025-2026 interim to study policies to support English
language acquisition, development and literacy. Section 11 also: (1) prescribes the
membership and duties of the Advisory Council; (2) requires the Department to
submit a written report describing the activities, findings, conclusions and
recommendations of the Advisory Council for transmittal to the 84th Session of the
Legislature; and (3) authorizes the Advisory Council to request the drafting of not
more than 1 legislative measure for prefiling on or before the first day of the regular
session of the Legislature in 2027.
Section 14 of this bill repeals an existing law which requires the principals of
certain schools that demonstrate low achievement for pupils who are English
learners to establish a corrective action plan. (NRS 388.408) Sections 7-9 of this
bill make conforming changes by removing references to the statute repealed by
section 14.
