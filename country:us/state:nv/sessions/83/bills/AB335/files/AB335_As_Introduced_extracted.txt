Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Section 4 of this bill requires the superintendent of each school district in a
2 county whose population is 100,000 or more (currently Clark and Washoe
3 Counties) to designate an employee to serve as Director of Multilingual Student
4 Services for the school district. Section 4 also prescribes the qualifications and
5 duties of the Director.
6 Existing law requires the principal of each school, in consultation with the
7 employees of the school, to prepare a plan to improve the achievement of pupils
8 enrolled in the school. (NRS 385A.650) Section 2 of this bill requires the principal
9 of a school to consult with the Director designated pursuant to section 4, if
10 applicable, in preparing or revising the plan. Section 2 requires such a plan to
11 include methods for closing gaps in achievement, if any, between different
12 demographics of pupils enrolled in the school. If at least 10 percent of the pupils
13 enrolled in the school are English learners, section 2 requires such a plan to: (1)
14 make closing gaps in achievement, if any, between pupils who are English learners
15 and pupils who are proficient in English the primary goal of the plan; and (2)
16 include certain quantitative goals and specific actions for improvement in the
17 achievement of pupils who are English learners. Section 1 of this bill makes a
18 conforming change to reflect the renumbering of subsections by section 2.
19 Section 5 of this bill requires the board of trustees of each school district to
20 ensure that each licensed teacher employed by the school district receives training
21 concerning English language acquisition. Section 5 also requires the Department of
22 Education to develop and provide guidance to each school district concerning the
23 training required by section 5. Section 12 of this bill requires a person who, on
24 October 1, 2025, holds a valid teacher’s license, to submit proof on or before
25 October 1, 2030, that the person has completed the training required by section 5.
26 Section 6 of this bill provides that, notwithstanding any other provision of law,
27 any pupil achievement data concerning a pupil who is a newcomer to the English
28 language, as designated by regulation of the State Board of Education, must not
29 negatively impact the performance rating of: (1) the school in which the pupil is
30 enrolled; (2) the school district in which the school is located; or (3) any employee
31 of the school in which the pupil is enrolled or school district in which the school is
32 located.
33 Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district to: (1)
34 develop a policy to teach English to pupils who are English learners; and (2) adopt
35 a plan to ensure that the policy achieves certain objectives. (NRS 388.407) Section
36 10 of this bill requires the policy to provide that a pupil who is a newcomer to the
37 English language, as designated by regulation of the State Board, may remain in
38 high school for not more than 8 semesters after the date on which the pupil was
39 otherwise scheduled to graduate or until the pupil is 21 years of age, whichever is
40 earlier. Section 10 also requires the Department to consult with the Director
41 designated pursuant to section 4, if applicable, in monitoring the implementation of
42 the policy and plan.
43 Section 11 of this bill requires the Department to establish an English Learner
44 Advisory Council in the 2025-2026 interim to study policies to support English
45 language acquisition, development and literacy. Section 11 also: (1) prescribes the

48 recommendations of the Advisory Council for transmittal to the 84th Session of the

50 more than 1 legislative measure for prefiling on or before the first day of the regular
51 session of the Legislature in 2027.
52 Section 14 of this bill repeals an existing law which requires the principals of
53 certain schools that demonstrate low achievement for pupils who are English
54 learners to establish a corrective action plan. (NRS 388.408) Sections 7-9 of this

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Section 4 of this bill requires the superintendent of each school district in a
2 county whose population is 100,000 or more (currently Clark and Washoe
3 Counties) to designate an employee to serve as Director of Multilingual Student
4 Services for the school district. Section 4 also prescribes the qualifications and
5 duties of the Director.
6 Existing law requires the principal of each school, in consultation with the
7 employees of the school, to prepare a plan to improve the achievement of pupils
8 enrolled in the school. (NRS 385A.650) Section 2 of this bill requires the principal
9 of a school to consult with the Director designated pursuant to section 4, if
10 applicable, in preparing or revising the plan. Section 2 requires such a plan to
11 include methods for closing gaps in achievement, if any, between different
12 demographics of pupils enrolled in the school. If at least 10 percent of the pupils
13 enrolled in the school are English learners, section 2 requires such a plan to: (1)
14 make closing gaps in achievement, if any, between pupils who are English learners
15 and pupils who are proficient in English the primary goal of the plan; and (2)
16 include certain quantitative goals and specific actions for improvement in the
17 achievement of pupils who are English learners. Section 1 of this bill makes a
18 conforming change to reflect the renumbering of subsections by section 2.
19 Section 5 of this bill requires the board of trustees of each school district to
20 ensure that each licensed teacher employed by the school district receives training
21 concerning English language acquisition. Section 5 also requires the Department of
22 Education to develop and provide guidance to each school district concerning the
23 training required by section 5. Section 12 of this bill requires a person who, on
24 October 1, 2025, holds a valid teacher’s license, to submit proof on or before
25 October 1, 2030, that the person has completed the training required by section 5.
26 Section 6 of this bill provides that, notwithstanding any other provision of law,
27 any pupil achievement data concerning a pupil who is a newcomer to the English
28 language, as designated by regulation of the State Board of Education, must not
29 negatively impact the performance rating of: (1) the school in which the pupil is
30 enrolled; (2) the school district in which the school is located; or (3) any employee
31 of the school in which the pupil is enrolled or school district in which the school is
32 located.
33 Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district to: (1)
34 develop a policy to teach English to pupils who are English learners; and (2) adopt
35 a plan to ensure that the policy achieves certain objectives. (NRS 388.407) Section
36 10 of this bill requires the policy to provide that a pupil who is a newcomer to the
37 English language, as designated by regulation of the State Board, may remain in
38 high school for not more than 8 semesters after the date on which the pupil was
39 otherwise scheduled to graduate or until the pupil is 21 years of age, whichever is
40 earlier. Section 10 also requires the Department to consult with the Director
41 designated pursuant to section 4, if applicable, in monitoring the implementation of
42 the policy and plan.
43 Section 11 of this bill requires the Department to establish an English Learner
44 Advisory Council in the 2025-2026 interim to study policies to support English
45 language acquisition, development and literacy. Section 11 also: (1) prescribes the
46 membership and duties of the Advisory Council; (2) requires the Department to
47 submit a written report describing the activities, findings, conclusions and
48 recommendations of the Advisory Council for transmittal to the 84th Session of the
49 Legislature; and (3) authorizes the Advisory Council to request the drafting of not
50 more than 1 legislative measure for prefiling on or before the first day of the regular
51 session of the Legislature in 2027.
52 Section 14 of this bill repeals an existing law which requires the principals of
53 certain schools that demonstrate low achievement for pupils who are English
54 learners to establish a corrective action plan. (NRS 388.408) Sections 7-9 of this
-
*AB335*

55 bill make conforming changes by removing references to the statute repealed by
56 section 14.
