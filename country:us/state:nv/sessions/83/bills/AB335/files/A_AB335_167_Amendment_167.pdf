Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Section 4 of this bill requires the superintendent of each school district [in a county
2 whose population is 100,000 or more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties)] to designate an
3 [employee] administrator to serve [as Director of Multilingual Student Services] in a role

Assembly Amendment No. 167 to Assembly Bill No. 335 Page 4
4 supporting pupils who are English learners for the school district. Section 4 also prescribes
5 the qualifications and duties of [the Director.] any such person.
6 Existing law requires the principal of each school, in consultation with the employees of
7 the school, to prepare a plan to improve the achievement of pupils enrolled in the school.
8 (NRS 385A.650) Section 2 of this bill requires the principal of a school to consult with the
9 [Director] administrator designated pursuant to section 4 [, if applicable,] in preparing or
10 revising the plan. Section 2 requires such a plan to include methods for closing gaps in
11 achievement, if any, between different demographics of pupils enrolled in the school. If at
12 least 10 percent of the pupils enrolled in the school are English learners, section 2 requires
13 such a plan to: (1) make closing gaps in achievement, if any, between pupils who are English
14 learners and pupils who are proficient in English the primary goal of the plan; and (2) include
15 certain quantitative goals and specific actions for improvement in the achievement of pupils
16 who are English learners. Section 1 of this bill makes a conforming change to reflect the
17 renumbering of subsections by section 2.
18 Section 5 of this bill requires the board of trustees of each school district to ensure that
19 each licensed teacher employed by the school district receives training concerning English
20 language acquisition. Section 5 also requires the Department of Education to develop and
21 provide guidance to each school district concerning the training required by section 5. Section
22 12 of this bill requires a [person who, on October 1, 2025, holds] teacher employed by a
23 [valid teacher’s license,] school district to submit proof of completion of the training
24 required by section 5 on or before October 1, 2030, [that the person has completed the
25 training required by section 5.] as a condition of continued employment after that date.
26 Section 6 of this bill requires data collected and maintained in the statewide system
27 of accountability for public schools concerning pupils who are English learners to be
28 disaggregated into certain subcategories, as designated by regulation of the State Board
29 of Education. Section 6 also provides that, notwithstanding any other provision of law, any
30 pupil achievement data concerning a pupil who is a newcomer to the English language, as
31 designated by regulation of the State Board , [of Education,] must not negatively impact the
32 performance rating of: (1) the school in which the pupil is enrolled; (2) the school district in
33 which the school is located; or (3) any employee of the school in which the pupil is enrolled or
34 school district in which the school is located.
35 Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district to: (1) develop a policy
36 to teach English to pupils who are English learners; and (2) adopt a plan to ensure that the
37 policy achieves certain objectives. (NRS 388.407) Section 10 of this bill requires the policy to
38 provide that a pupil who is a newcomer to the English language, as designated by regulation
39 of the State Board, may remain in high school for not more than [8] 10 semesters after the
40 date on which the pupil was otherwise scheduled to graduate or until the pupil is 21 years of
41 age, whichever is earlier. Section 10 also requires the Department to consult with the
42 [Director] administrator designated pursuant to section 4 [, if applicable,] in monitoring the
43 implementation of the policy and plan.
44 Section 11 of this bill requires the Department to establish an English Learner Advisory
45 Council in the 2025-2026 interim to study policies to support English language acquisition,
46 development and literacy. Section 11 also: (1) prescribes the membership and duties of the
47 Advisory Council; (2) requires the Department to submit a written report describing the
48 activities, findings, conclusions and recommendations of the Advisory Council for transmittal
49 to the 84th Session of the Legislature; and (3) authorizes the Advisory Council to request the
50 drafting of not more than 1 legislative measure for prefiling on or before the first day of the
51 regular session of the Legislature in 2027.
52 Section 14 of this bill repeals an existing law which requires the principals of certain
53 schools that demonstrate low achievement for pupils who are English learners to establish a
54 corrective action plan. (NRS 388.408) Sections 7-9 of this bill make conforming changes by
55 removing references to the statute repealed by section 14.
