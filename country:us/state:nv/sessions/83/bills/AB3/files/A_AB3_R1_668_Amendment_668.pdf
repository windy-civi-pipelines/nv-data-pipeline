EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to civil actions; revising provisions relating to alternate dispute
resolution for certain civil actions; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires, with certain exceptions, civil actions for damages that do not
2 exceed $50,000 per plaintiff to be submitted to nonbinding arbitration. (NRS 38.250, 38.255)
3 Section 1.5 of this bill increases the monetary threshold for mandatory nonbinding arbitration
4 in civil actions to $100,000 per plaintiff. Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to
5 reflect that the monetary threshold for mandatory nonbinding arbitration is increased to
6 $100,000 per plaintiff by section 1.5.
7 Existing law requires the Supreme Court to adopt rules to provide for the establishment of
8 a program of arbitration, and such rules must include, for example: (1) provisions for the
9 payment of fees to an arbitrator who is appointed to hear a case and who must be compensated
10 at a rate of $100 per hour, to a maximum of $1,000 per case, unless otherwise authorized by
11 the arbitration commissioner for good cause shown; (2) guidelines for the award of attorney’s
12 fees; and (3) exclusion of certain types of actions from the program, such as class actions,
13 probate actions and actions involving domestic relations. (NRS 38.255) Section 2 revises the
14 requirements for the rules adopted by the Supreme Court to: (1) [increase the rate of] remove
15 the existing limitations on the amount of compensation for an arbitrator [to $150 per hour,
16 to a maximum of $2,000 per case;] and instead require the payment of both fees and costs
17 to an arbitrator, which are generally subject to certain maximum limitations on
18 compensation required to be established by the rules; (2) authorize an arbitrator to award
19 to a prevailing party attorney’s fees in an amount not to exceed $15,000, as provided by
20 specific statute or court rule, and [fees,] costs and interest [in an amount not to exceed
21 $15,000,] as provided by specific statute or court rule; and (3) exclude additional types of
22 actions from the program . [; and (4) provide that, based upon the amount of the arbitration
23 award, a trial anew after an arbitration must be conducted either in district court or as a short
24 trial.]
25 Existing law provides that the Supreme Court may authorize the use of settlement
26 conferences and other alternative methods of resolving disputes, including, without limitation,
27 a short trial. If the Supreme Court authorizes the use of an alternative method of resolving
28 disputes, the Supreme Court is required to adopt rules and procedures to govern the use of any
29 such method. (NRS 38.258) Section 3 of this bill provides that if the Supreme Court

Senate Amendment No. 668 to Assembly Bill No. 3 First Reprint Page 4
30 authorizes the use of a short trial, in addition to any other appropriate provisions, the rules and
31 procedures governing a short trial must authorize the short trial judge to award to the
32 prevailing party attorney’s fees in an amount not to exceed $15,000, as provided by specific
33 statute or court rule.
34 [Existing law provides that if an action is submitted to arbitration and, after arbitration, a
35 party requests a trial anew before a jury: (1) the written findings made by the arbitrator or the
36 panel of arbitrators must be admitted at trial; and (2) the court is required to give a specific
37 instruction to the jury. (NRS 38.259) Section 4 of this bill removes such requirements.]
38 Sections 1, 1.5 and 3 make a conforming change to apply the definition of the term
39 “short trial” to the provisions of this bill.
