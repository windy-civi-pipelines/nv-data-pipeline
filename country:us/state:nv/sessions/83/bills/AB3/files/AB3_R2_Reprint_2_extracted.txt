Referred to Committee on Judiciary
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to alternative dispute
resolution. (BDR 3-472)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to civil actions; revising provisions relating to
alternate dispute resolution for certain civil actions; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires, with certain exceptions, civil actions for damages that do
2 not exceed $50,000 per plaintiff to be submitted to nonbinding arbitration. (NRS
3 38.250, 38.255) Section 1.5 of this bill increases the monetary threshold for
4 mandatory nonbinding arbitration in civil actions to $100,000 per plaintiff. Section
5 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to reflect that the monetary threshold for
6 mandatory nonbinding arbitration is increased to $100,000 per plaintiff by
7 section 1.5.
8 Existing law requires the Supreme Court to adopt rules to provide for the
9 establishment of a program of arbitration, and such rules must include, for example:
10 (1) provisions for the payment of fees to an arbitrator who is appointed to hear a
11 case and who must be compensated at a rate of $100 per hour, to a maximum of
12 $1,000 per case, unless otherwise authorized by the arbitration commissioner for
13 good cause shown; (2) guidelines for the award of attorney’s fees; and (3) exclusion
14 of certain types of actions from the program, such as class actions, probate actions
15 and actions involving domestic relations. (NRS 38.255) Section 2 revises the
16 requirements for the rules adopted by the Supreme Court to: (1) remove the existing
17 limitations on the amount of compensation for an arbitrator and instead require the
18 payment of both fees and costs to an arbitrator, which are generally subject to
19 certain maximum limitations on compensation required to be established by the
20 rules; (2) authorize an arbitrator to award to a prevailing party attorney’s fees in an
21 amount not to exceed $15,000, as provided by specific statute or court rule, and
22 costs and interest as provided by specific statute or court rule; and (3) exclude
23 additional types of actions from the program.

24 Existing law provides that the Supreme Court may authorize the use of
25 settlement conferences and other alternative methods of resolving disputes,
26 including, without limitation, a short trial. If the Supreme Court authorizes the use
27 of an alternative method of resolving disputes, the Supreme Court is required to
28 adopt rules and procedures to govern the use of any such method. (NRS 38.258)
29 Section 3 of this bill provides that if the Supreme Court authorizes the use of a
30 short trial, in addition to any other appropriate provisions, the rules and procedures
31 governing a short trial must authorize the short trial judge to award to the prevailing
32 party attorney’s fees in an amount not to exceed $15,000, as provided by specific
33 statute or court rule.
34 Sections 1, 1.5 and 3 make a conforming change to apply the definition of the
35 term “short trial” to the provisions of this bill.
