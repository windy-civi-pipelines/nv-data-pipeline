SUMMARY—[Increases the monetary threshold for mandatory nonbinding
arbitration in civil actions.] Revises provisions relating to
alternative dispute resolution. (BDR 3-472)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to civil actions; [increasing the monetary threshold for mandatory
nonbinding arbitration in civil actions;] revising provisions relating
to alternate dispute resolution for certain civil actions; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires, with certain exceptions, civil actions for damages that do not
2 exceed $50,000 per plaintiff to be submitted to nonbinding arbitration. (NRS 38.250, 38.255)
3 Section [1] 1.5 of this bill increases the monetary threshold for mandatory nonbinding
4 arbitration in civil actions to $100,000 per plaintiff. Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming
5 change to reflect that the monetary threshold for mandatory nonbinding arbitration is
6 increased to $100,000 per plaintiff by section [1.] 1.5.
7 Existing law requires the Supreme Court to adopt rules to provide for the
8 establishment of a program of arbitration, and such rules must include, for example: (1)
9 provisions for the payment of fees to an arbitrator who is appointed to hear a case and
10 who must be compensated at a rate of $100 per hour, to a maximum of $1,000 per case,
11 unless otherwise authorized by the arbitration commissioner for good cause shown; (2)
12 guidelines for the award of attorney’s fees; and (3) exclusion of certain types of actions
13 from the program, such as class actions, probate actions and actions involving domestic
14 relations. (NRS 38.255) Section 2 revises the requirements for the rules adopted by the
15 Supreme Court to: (1) increase the rate of compensation for an arbitrator to $150 per
16 hour, to a maximum of $2,000 per case; (2) authorize an arbitrator to award to a
17 prevailing party attorney’s fees in an amount not to exceed $15,000, as provided by
18 specific statute or court rule, and fees, costs and interest in an amount not to exceed
19 $15,000, as provided by specific statute or court rule; (3) exclude additional types of
20 actions from the program; and (4) provide that, based upon the amount of the
21 arbitration award, a trial anew after an arbitration must be conducted either in district
22 court or as a short trial.
23 Existing law provides that the Supreme Court may authorize the use of settlement
24 conferences and other alternative methods of resolving disputes, including, without
25 limitation, a short trial. If the Supreme Court authorizes the use of an alternative
26 method of resolving disputes, the Supreme Court is required to adopt rules and
Assembly Amendment No. 285 to Assembly Bill No. 3 Page 4
27 procedures to govern the use of any such method. (NRS 38.258) Section 3 of this bill
28 provides that if the Supreme Court authorizes the use of a short trial, in addition to any
29 other appropriate provisions, the rules and procedures governing a short trial must
30 authorize the short trial judge to award to the prevailing party attorney’s fees in an
31 amount not to exceed $15,000, as provided by specific statute or court rule.
32 Existing law provides that if an action is submitted to arbitration and, after
33 arbitration, a party requests a trial anew before a jury: (1) the written findings made by
34 the arbitrator or the panel of arbitrators must be admitted at trial; and (2) the court is
35 required to give a specific instruction to the jury. (NRS 38.259) Section 4 of this bill
36 removes such requirements.
37 Sections 1, 1.5 and 3 make a conforming change to apply the definition of the term
38 “short trial” to the provisions of this bill.

11 in favor of ................(name of the party) and ................(“awarded damages in the
12 amount of $................” or “did not award any damages on that cause of action”).
13 The findings of the arbitrator may be given the same weight as other evidence or
14 may be disregarded. However, you must not give those findings undue weight
15 because they were made by an arbitrator, and you must not use the findings of the
16 arbitrator as a substitute for your independent judgment. You must weigh all the
17 evidence that was presented at trial and arrive at a conclusion based upon your own
18 determination of the cause of action.
19
20 3. The court shall give a separate instruction pursuant to paragraph (b) of
