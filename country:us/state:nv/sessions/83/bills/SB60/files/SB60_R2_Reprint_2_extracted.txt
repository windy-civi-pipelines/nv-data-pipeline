EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to crimes; expanding the types of crimes that
require the imposition of an additional criminal penalty
for certain crimes committed against an older or a
vulnerable person; providing that persons convicted of
these types of crimes may be liable for certain civil
penalties to be recovered by the Attorney General; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the imposition of an additional penalty upon a person
2 who commits certain crimes against a person 60 years of age or older or a
3 vulnerable person, which must run consecutively with the sentence prescribed by
4 statute for the crime. (NRS 193.167) Section 1 of this bill expands the list of crimes
5 against an older or a vulnerable person that require the imposition of the additional
6 penalty. Specifically, section 1 applies the additional penalty to the following forms
7 of theft committed against an older or vulnerable person: (1) controlling property of
8 another with intent to deprive that person of the property; (2) the conversion of,
9 unauthorized transfer of an interest in or unauthorized control of the property of
10 another by a person who had the authority to possess the property only for a limited
11 duration or use; or (3) obtaining the property or services of another by a material
12 misrepresentation with intent to deprive the person of the property or services.
13 Section 1 also applies the additional penalty to a criminal deceptive trade practice
14 committed knowingly or intentionally against an older or a vulnerable person.
15 Section 6 of this bill adds those theft and deceptive trade practice crimes to the list
16 of crimes for which a person is also liable for a civil penalty, which may be

17 recovered by the Attorney General. (NRS 228.280) Under existing law, a person
18 convicted of those theft or deceptive trade practice crimes against an older or
19 vulnerable person would also not be eligible for probation or release on parole until
20 the person has paid at least 80 percent of the amount of restitution set by the court.
