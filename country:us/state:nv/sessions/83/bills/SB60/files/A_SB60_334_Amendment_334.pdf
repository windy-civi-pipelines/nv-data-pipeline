crimes are committed against an older person;] providing [penalties;]
that persons convicted of these types of crimes may be liable for

providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the imposition of an additional penalty upon a person who commits
2 certain crimes against a person 60 years of age or older or a vulnerable person, which must
3 run consecutively with the sentence prescribed by statute for the crime. (NRS 193.167)
4 Section 1 of this bill expands the list of crimes against an older or a vulnerable person that
5 require the imposition of the additional penalty to include [: (1) residential burglary; (2)
6 invasion of the home; (3) theft, or attempted theft; (4) forgery, or attempted forgery; (5)
7 larceny, or attempted larceny; (6) fraud, or attempted fraud; and (7) engaging in a deceptive
8 trade practice.
9 Existing law establishes the crime of burglary and sets forth various penalties based on
10 the structure in which the burglary is committed. A burglary of a dwelling is considered
11 residential burglary and is a category B felony punishable by imprisonment in the state prison
12 for a minimum term of not less than 1 year and a maximum term of not more than 10 years.
13 (NRS 205.060) Section 2 of this bill increases the minimum term of imprisonment to not less
14 than 2 years and the maximum term of imprisonment to not more than 20 years if a person: (1)
15 is convicted of residential burglary; and (2) causes the death of or serious bodily injury to a
16 person 60 years of age or older during the commission of the crime.
17 Existing law prohibits a person from forcibly entering a dwelling without the permission
18 of the owner, resident or lawful occupant, and makes such an invasion of the home a category
19 B felony punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for a minimum term of not less than 1

Senate Amendment No. 334 to Senate Bill No. 60 Page 4
20 year and a maximum term of not more than 10 years. (NRS 205.067) Section 3 of this bill
21 increases the minimum term of imprisonment to not less than 2 years and the maximum term
22 of imprisonment to not more than 20 years if a person: (1) is convicted of invasion of the
23 home; and (2) causes the death of or serious bodily injury to a person 60 years of age or older
24 during the commission of the crime.
25 Existing law provides that if a person commits certain property crimes against a person
26 60 years of age or older or a vulnerable person for which the person is subject to an additional
27 penalty: (1) the court is prohibited from granting probation to the person until the person has
28 paid to the victim of the crime at least 80 percent of the amount of restitution set by the court;
29 (2) the State Board of Parole Commissioners is prohibited from releasing the person on parole
30 until the person has paid to the victim of the crime at least 80 percent of the amount of
31 restitution set by the court; and (3) the person is liable for a civil penalty to be recovered by
32 the Attorney General in a civil action brought in the name of the State of Nevada. (NRS
33 176A.120, 213.1216, 228.280) Sections 4 and 5 of this bill add to the list of crimes for which
34 a person is prohibited from being granted parole or released from parole until the person has
35 paid at least 80 percent of the amount of restitution set by the court: (1) residential burglary;
36 (2) invasion of the home; (3) theft, or attempted theft; (4) forgery, or attempted forgery; (5)
37 larceny, or attempted larceny; (6) fraud, or attempted fraud; and (7) engaging in a deceptive
38 trade practice.] the following forms of theft: (1) controlling property of another with
39 intent to deprive that person of the property; (2) the conversion of, unauthorized
40 transfer of an interest in or unauthorized control of the property of another by a person
41 who had the authority to possess the property only for a limited duration or use; or (3)
42 obtaining the property or services of another by a material misrepresentation with intent
43 to deprive the person of the property or services. Section 6 of this bill adds those
44 [additional] theft crimes to the list of crimes for which a person is also liable for a civil
45 penalty [.] , which may be recovered by the Attorney General. (NRS 228.280) Under
46 existing law, a person convicted of those theft crimes against an older or vulnerable
47 person would also not be eligible for probation or release on parole until the person has
48 paid at least 80 percent of the amount of restitution set by the court. (NRS 176A.120,
49 213.1216)
