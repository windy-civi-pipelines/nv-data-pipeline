EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to crimes; expanding the types of crimes that
require the imposition of an additional criminal penalty
for certain crimes committed intentionally or knowingly
against an older or a vulnerable person; providing that
persons convicted of these types of crimes may be liable
for certain civil penalties to be recovered by the Attorney
General; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the imposition of an additional penalty upon a person
2 who commits certain crimes against a person 60 years of age or older or a
3 vulnerable person, which must run consecutively with the sentence prescribed by
4 statute for the crime. (NRS 193.167) Section 1 of this bill expands the list of crimes
5 against an older or a vulnerable person that require the imposition of the additional
6 penalty. Specifically, section 1 applies the additional penalty to the following forms
7 of theft intentionally or knowingly committed against an older or vulnerable
8 person: (1) controlling property of another with intent to deprive that person of the
9 property; (2) the conversion of, unauthorized transfer of an interest in or
10 unauthorized control of the property of another by a person who had the authority
11 to possess the property only for a limited duration or use; or (3) obtaining the
12 property or services of another by a material misrepresentation with intent to
13 deprive the person of the property or services. Section 1 also applies the additional
14 penalty to a criminal deceptive trade practice committed intentionally or knowingly
15 against an older or a vulnerable person. Section 6 of this bill adds those theft and

16 deceptive trade practice crimes to the list of crimes for which a person is also liable
17 for a civil penalty, which may be recovered by the Attorney General. (NRS
18 228.280) Under existing law, a person convicted of those theft or deceptive trade
19 practice crimes against an older or vulnerable person would also not be eligible for
20 probation or release on parole until the person has paid at least 80 percent of the
21 amount of restitution set by the court. (NRS 176A.120, 213.1216)
