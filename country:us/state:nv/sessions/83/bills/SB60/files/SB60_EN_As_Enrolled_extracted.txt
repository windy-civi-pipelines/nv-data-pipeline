Section 1:
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to crimes; expanding the types of crimes that
require the imposition of an additional criminal penalty for
certain crimes committed intentionally or knowingly against
an older or a vulnerable person; providing that persons
convicted of these types of crimes may be liable for certain
civil penalties to be recovered by the Attorney General; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law requires the imposition of an additional penalty upon a person
who commits certain crimes against a person 60 years of age or older or a
vulnerable person, which must run consecutively with the sentence prescribed by
statute for the crime. (NRS 193.167) Section 1 of this bill expands the list of crimes
against an older or a vulnerable person that require the imposition of the additional
penalty. Specifically, section 1 applies the additional penalty to the following forms
of theft intentionally or knowingly committed against an older or vulnerable
person: (1) controlling property of another with intent to deprive that person of the
property; (2) the conversion of, unauthorized transfer of an interest in or
unauthorized control of the property of another by a person who had the authority
to possess the property only for a limited duration or use; or (3) obtaining the
property or services of another by a material misrepresentation with intent to
deprive the person of the property or services. Section 1 also applies the additional
penalty to a criminal deceptive trade practice committed intentionally or knowingly
against an older or a vulnerable person. Section 6 of this bill adds those theft and
deceptive trade practice crimes to the list of crimes for which a person is also liable
for a civil penalty, which may be recovered by the Attorney General. (NRS

Section 2:
228.280) Under existing law, a person convicted of those theft or deceptive trade
practice crimes against an older or vulnerable person would also not be eligible for
probation or release on parole until the person has paid at least 80 percent of the
amount of restitution set by the court. (NRS 176A.120, 213.1216)
