EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to crimes; expanding the types of crimes that
require the imposition of an additional criminal penalty
for certain crimes committed against an older or a
vulnerable person; providing that persons convicted of
these types of crimes may be liable for certain civil
penalties to be recovered by the Attorney General; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the imposition of an additional penalty upon a person
2 who commits certain crimes against a person 60 years of age or older or a
3 vulnerable person, which must run consecutively with the sentence prescribed by
4 statute for the crime. (NRS 193.167) Section 1 of this bill expands the list of crimes
5 against an older or a vulnerable person that require the imposition of the additional
6 penalty to include the following forms of theft: (1) controlling property of another
7 with intent to deprive that person of the property; (2) the conversion of,
8 unauthorized transfer of an interest in or unauthorized control of the property of
9 another by a person who had the authority to possess the property only for a limited
10 duration or use; or (3) obtaining the property or services of another by a material
11 misrepresentation with intent to deprive the person of the property or services.
12 Section 6 of this bill adds those theft crimes to the list of crimes for which a person
13 is also liable for a civil penalty, which may be recovered by the Attorney General.
14 (NRS 228.280) Under existing law, a person convicted of those theft crimes against
15 an older or vulnerable person would also not be eligible for probation or release on
