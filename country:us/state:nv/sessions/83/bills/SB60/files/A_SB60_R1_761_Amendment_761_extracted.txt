EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to crimes; expanding the types of crimes that require the
imposition of an additional criminal penalty for certain crimes
committed against an older or a vulnerable person; providing that
persons convicted of these types of crimes may be liable for certain
civil penalties to be recovered by the Attorney General; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the imposition of an additional penalty upon a person who commits
2 certain crimes against a person 60 years of age or older or a vulnerable person, which must
3 run consecutively with the sentence prescribed by statute for the crime. (NRS 193.167)
4 Section 1 of this bill expands the list of crimes against an older or a vulnerable person that
5 require the imposition of the additional penalty . [to include] Specifically, section 1 applies
6 the additional penalty to the following forms of theft [:] committed against an older or
7 vulnerable person: (1) controlling property of another with intent to deprive that person of
8 the property; (2) the conversion of, unauthorized transfer of an interest in or unauthorized
9 control of the property of another by a person who had the authority to possess the property
10 only for a limited duration or use; or (3) obtaining the property or services of another by a
11 material misrepresentation with intent to deprive the person of the property or services.
12 Section 1 also applies the additional penalty to a criminal deceptive trade practice
13 committed knowingly or intentionally against an older or a vulnerable person. Section 6
14 of this bill adds those theft and deceptive trade practice crimes to the list of crimes for
15 which a person is also liable for a civil penalty, which may be recovered by the Attorney
16 General. (NRS 228.280) Under existing law, a person convicted of those theft or deceptive
17 trade practice crimes against an older or vulnerable person would also not be eligible for
18 probation or release on parole until the person has paid at least 80 percent of the amount of
19 restitution set by the court. (NRS 176A.120, 213.1216)

4 Section 1 of this bill expands the list of crimes against an older or a vulnerable person that
5 require the imposition of the additional penalty . [to include] Specifically, section 1 applies
6 the additional penalty to the following forms of theft [:] committed against an older or
7 vulnerable person: (1) controlling property of another with intent to deprive that person of
