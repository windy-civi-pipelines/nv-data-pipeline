of this bill authorizes the Division to distribute money in the Account to eligible
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 2 –
entities for certain expenditures relating to attainable housing. Section 50 of this
bill appropriates $133,000,000 to the Account.
Section 11 of this bill requires the Administrator of the Division to adopt an
annual allocation plan for disbursing money from the Account. Section 50.5 of this
bill requires the Division to include in the initial allocation plan adopted pursuant to
section 11 certain allocations of money from the Account for certain purposes
authorized by section 10.
Section 22 of this bill exempts the Division from complying with the
provisions of the Administrative Procedures Act in adopting the annual allocation
plan.
Section 12 of this bill requires that an eligible entity provide or secure
matching funds in an amount not less than the amount of the money awarded to the
eligible entity from the Account.
Section 14.5 of this bill requires the Division to submit a report of certain
information to the Interim Finance Committee at the last meeting of each fiscal year
and the last meeting of each calendar year relating to the Account.
Section 15 of this bill: (1) creates the Nevada Attainable Housing Council to
provide oversight and strategic guidance for the administration and allocation of the
Account; and (2) sets forth the membership of the Council.
Section 16 of this bill requires the Division to establish procedures to ensure
that any member of the Council discloses any direct or indirect financial interest in
any attainable housing project or eligible entity that applies for or receives funding
from the Account.
Section 17 of this bill requires the Council to: (1) review and comment on
certain housing reports; and (2) provide recommendations to the Division regarding
the allocation and use of money from the Account.
Existing law creates the position of Housing Advocate within the Division and
establishes the duties for the position, which include providing information and
assistance to persons who reside in affordable housing and manufactured housing.
(NRS 319.141) Section 17.3 of this bill renames the position of Housing Advocate
as the Housing Liaison.
Existing law requires the Division to create and maintain a statewide low-
income housing database. The database is required to include certain information
relating to low-income housing, including compilations and analysis of
demographic, economic and housing data from a variety of sources. (NRS 319.143)
Section 17.6 of this bill requires the inclusion of any survey conducted by the
Division in the database. Section 17.6 also revises the data that is required to be
included in the database by: (1) changing the measure for determining the number
of households in various population groups experiencing high housing costs from
50 percent to 30 percent of household income; (2) increasing from 2 years to 3
years the length of the planning period for identifying when subsidized units are
forecast to convert to market-rate units; and (3) adding information regarding
certain multi-family residential housing. Section 17.6 further requires the Division,
on or before December 31 of each year, to analyze the data in the database and
prepare and post on its website a report of its analysis.
Existing law authorizes, with certain exceptions, the Division to: (1) establish
certain funds or accounts; and (2) invest or deposit its money, but does not require
the Division to keep any of its money in the State Treasury. (NRS 319.170) Section
18 of this bill creates an additional exception to these provisions for the Account
created by section 9.
Existing law creates the Account for Affordable Housing in the State General
Fund, which is required to be administered by the Division, and prescribes the
distribution and use of money in the Account. (NRS 319.500, 319.510) Under
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 3 –
existing law, the costs to create and maintain the statewide low-income housing
database are required to be paid from the Account up to a maximum of $175,000
per year. (NRS 319.143, 319.510) Sections 17.6 and 18.5 of this bill: (1) require
payment from the Account of the costs to prepare the new annual report required by
section 17.6; and (2) change the maximum annual amount authorized from the
Account for the payment of costs related to the database from the fixed amount of
$175,000 to not more than 6 percent of the money deposited in the Account in each
fiscal year.
Existing law also authorizes the Division to expend not more than $40,000 per
year or an amount equal to 6 percent of money received pursuant to the federal
HOME Investment Partnerships Act, whichever is greater, as reimbursement for
administering the Account and that federal money. (NRS 319.510; 42 U.S.C. §§
12701 et seq.) Section 18.5: (1) eliminates the authority of the Division to receive
reimbursement from the Account for administering that federal money; and (2)
changes the maximum amount authorized from the Account as reimbursement for
administering the Account to not more than 6 percent of the money deposited in the
Account in each fiscal year.
Existing law requires the Division to distribute a certain portion of the
remaining money in the Account to the Division of Welfare and Supportive
Services of the Department of Health and Human Services for a program to provide
emergency assistance to needy families with children. (NRS 319.510) Section 18.5
eliminates this required distribution to the Division for this program, but
specifically authorizes the use of money in the Account for the same purpose. With
the elimination of this distribution to the Division, all of the remaining money in
the Account will effectively be distributed to the other authorized recipients in
existing law, which are certain charitable organizations, housing authorities and
local governments for the acquisition, construction and rehabilitation of affordable
housing for eligible families, subject to certain requirements. One such eligibility
requirement in existing law is that not less than 15 percent of the units acquired,
constructed or rehabilitated be affordable to persons whose income is at or below
the federally designated level signifying poverty. (NRS 319.510) Section 18.5: (1)
changes the income level for that requirement to be at or below 30 percent of the
median monthly gross household income for the applicable county; and (2) clarifies
that the money is authorized to be distributed to one or more of the types of entities
that are eligible recipients. Section 18.5 also eliminates the eligibility requirement
in existing law that a local government sponsor such a project.
Sections 2-8 of this bill define certain terms relating to the provisions of
sections 2-17.
Sections 19 and 20 of this bill authorize the Division to establish a program for
the reporting of rental payments to a credit reporting agency.
Existing law sets forth certain procedures for a board of county commissioners
or governing body of a city to sell or lease real property. (NRS 244.281, 268.061)
Sections 23 and 26 of this bill require, before approving the sale or lease of real
property for the development of attainable housing, in addition to other procedures,
the board or governing body to evaluate the capacity and commitment of the
developer to provide long-term benefits to the county in a manner that promotes
transparency and does not interfere with equitable competition. Sections 23 and 26
also require the developer to submit certain information to the board or governing
body.
Existing law authorizes a nonprofit organization to submit to a board of county
commissioners or governing body of a city an application for conveyance of certain
property that is owned by the county or city, as applicable. The board or governing
body may approve such an application if the nonprofit organization demonstrates
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 4 –
that the organization or its assignee will use the property to develop affordable
housing. (NRS 244.287, 268.058) Sections 24 and 25 of this bill: (1) instead
authorize the board or governing body to approve such an application for attainable
housing; and (2) require an application to include certain information.
Existing law establishes three tiers of affordable housing for various purposes
in existing law and defines “affordable housing” as housing that falls within any of
the three tiers. (NRS 232.860, 244.189, 244.287, 268.058, 268.190, 278.0105,
279.385, 279A.020, 279B.020, 315.9625, 319.042) Section 33 of this bill revises
the term “affordable housing” to be “attainable housing.”
Under existing law, the tiers are based on both household income and the costs
of housing as a percentage of that income. With respect to household income: (1)
“tier one affordable housing” is housing for a household which has a total monthly
gross income that is equal to not more than 60 percent of the median monthly gross
household income for the county in which the housing is located, which is
commonly known as the area median household income; (2) “tier two affordable
housing” is housing for a household which has a total monthly gross income that is
equal to more than 60 percent but not more than 80 percent of the area median
household income; and (3) “tier three affordable housing” is housing for a
household which has a total monthly gross income that is equal to more than 80
percent but not more than 120 percent of the area median household income. In
addition, with respect to the costs of housing, affordable housing under existing law
is housing that costs not more than 30 percent of the total monthly gross household
income of the household with an income at the maximum percentage of the area
median household income for the tier. (NRS 278.01902, 278.01904, 278,01906)
Section 29.5 of this bill creates a new tier of affordable housing, to be known as
“tier one affordable housing,” that addresses housing for a household that has a
total monthly gross income that is equal to not more than 30 percent of the area
median household income. As a result of the creation of this new tier of affordable
housing, section 34 of this bill renames “tier one affordable housing” in existing
law as “tier two affordable housing” and changes the percentage range for median
income for that tier to more than 30 percent but not more than 60 percent of the
area median household income. Section 36 of this bill renames “tier two affordable
housing” in existing law for which the percentage range for median income is more
than 60 percent, but not more than 80 percent of the area median household
income, as “tier three affordable housing.” Section 35 of this bill renames “tier
three affordable housing” in existing law, for which the percentage range for
median income is more than 80 percent but not more than 120 percent of the area
median household income, as “tier four affordable housing.”
Section 29 of this bill creates a new tier of affordable housing, to be known as
“tier five affordable housing,” that addresses housing for a household that has a
total monthly gross income that is equal to not more than 120 percent but not more
than 150 percent of the area median household income.
Section 37.5 of this bill makes a conforming change to reflect the changes in
the tiers.
Existing law sets forth an approval process for the subdivision of land that
requires a subdivider to submit a tentative map to the planning commission or
governing body of a county or city, as applicable. (NRS 278.330) Existing law also
requires the tentative map to be forwarded to certain state agencies and local
governments for review. (NRS 278.335) Section 31 of this bill requires each
reviewing agency to adopt a process for the expedited review of and comment on a
tentative map that includes attainable housing.
Existing law requires the governing body of each county and city, on or before
July 1, 2024, to enact by ordinance an expedited process for the consideration and
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 5 –
approval of projects for affordable housing. (Section 12 of Assembly Bill No. 213,
chapter 200, Statutes of Nevada 2023, at p. 1171) Section 30 of this bill requires
the governing body of each county and the governing body of each city to adopt an
expedited process for the consideration and approval of projects for attainable
housing.
Section 32 of this bill applies the definitions of certain terms relating to
planning and zoning and the newly defined terms in sections 29 and 29.5 to
sections 29-31.
Sections 34-36 of this bill, respectively, revise the definitions of “tier one
affordable housing,” “tier three affordable housing” and “tier two affordable
housing” to provide that the costs of such housing may be offset by certain energy
cost savings.
Existing law requires the governing body of certain cities and counties to adopt
at least 6 of 12 specified measures in implementing a plan for maintaining and
developing affordable housing, which may include a measure to reduce or subsidize
impact fees, fees for the issuance of building permits and fees imposed for the
purpose for which an enterprise fund was created. (NRS 278.235) Section 37 of
this bill authorizes that the governing body of such a county or city include a
measure to also reimburse such fees.
Existing law requires the governing body of certain cities or counties to submit
to the Division annual progress reports relating to affordable housing. (NRS
278.235) Existing law requires: (1) the inclusion of these reports in the statewide
low-income housing database; and (2) the Division to compile and post these
reports on its Internet website. (NRS 278.235, 319.143) Section 37 moves the
deadline for: (1) the submission of the reports to the Division from July 15 to
March 15; and (2) the posting of the compilation of the reports by the Division
from August 15 to April 15. The new deadlines apply starting in 2026, as section
49.5 of this bill requires: (1) the governing body of a city or county to submit the
2025 report to the Division on or before July 15, 2025; and (2) the Division to
compile the reports and post the compilation on the Internet website of the Division
on or before August 15, 2025.
Existing law sets forth the requirements for obtaining a contractor’s license
from the State Contractors’ Board. (Chapter 624 of NRS) Section 39 of this bill
requires, under certain circumstances, the Board to issue a contractor’s license by
endorsement to certain applicants who will perform work on an attainable housing
project in certain rural areas.
Section 40 of this bill provides that, if the Director of the Department of
Business and Industry determines that there is a shortage of skilled labor or licensed
contractors in a rural area that is adversely impacting the availability of attainable
housing for essential workers who are employed in the area, the Director may issue
a declaration of such shortage for not more than 3 years. Upon such a declaration,
the Board is required to implement a process to issue provisional contractors’
licenses to certain applicants who will perform work on an attainable housing
project in certain rural areas.
Sections 41 and 42 of this bill exempt the license by endorsement issued
pursuant to section 39 or a provisional license issued pursuant to section 40 from
certain licensing requirements and the expiration date that generally apply to
contractors’ licenses. Sections 42-46 of this bill exempt applicants for a new
contractor’s license and existing licensed contractors in rural areas from any
application, license or renewal fee or certain other fees relating to a contractor’s
license under circumstances where the Director of the Department of Business and
Industry has issued a declaration of shortage pursuant to section 40.

Counsel Bureau that includes a recommendation as to whether the requirements to
issue such licenses by endorsement and provisional licenses, as required by
sections 39 and 40, should be continued, modified or terminated.

general obligation bonds to provide certain loans for the development or
construction of certain projects. Section 37.2 makes a conforming change.
