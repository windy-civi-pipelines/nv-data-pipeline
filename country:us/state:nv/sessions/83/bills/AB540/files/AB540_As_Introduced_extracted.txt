4 Account in the State General Fund, to be administered by the Division. Section 10
5 of this bill authorizes the Division to distribute money in the Account to eligible
6 entities for expenditures relating to attainable housing. Section 50 of this bill
7 appropriates $200,000,000 to the Account for the purposes of section 10.
8 Section 11 of this bill requires the Administrator of the Division to adopt an
9 annual allocation plan for disbursing money from the Account. Section 22 of this
10 bill exempts the Division from complying with the provisions of the Administrative
11 Procedures Act in adopting the annual allocation plan.
12 Section 12 of this bill requires, with certain exceptions, that an eligible entity
13 provide or secure matching funds in an amount not less than the amount of the
14 money awarded to the eligible entity from the Account.
15 Section 13 of this bill provides, with certain exceptions, that any attainable
16 housing project that receives money from the Account is not a public work and is
17 exempt from the requirements to pay prevailing wages.
18 Section 14 of this bill authorizes the Division to adopt regulations setting forth
19 standards and requirements for any program for rental assistance or eviction
20 diversion that receives funding from the Account.
21 Section 15 of this bill: (1) creates the Nevada Attainable Housing Council to
22 provide oversight and strategic guidance for the administration and allocation of the
23 Account; and (2) sets forth the membership of the Council.

42 Existing law creates the Nevada State Infrastructure Bank within the Office of
43 the State Treasurer, the purpose of which is to provide loans and other financial
44 assistance to qualified borrowers for the development, construction, repair,
45 improvement, operation, maintenance decommissioning and ownership of certain
46 transportation facilities, utility infrastructure, water and wastewater infrastructure,
47 renewable energy infrastructure, recycling and sustainability infrastructure, digital
48 infrastructure, K-12 school facilities, social infrastructure and other infrastructure
49 related to economic development as necessary for public purposes. (NRS 226.778)
50 Existing law further provides that provisions of law that require the payment of
51 prevailing wages to skilled labor apply to any contract for construction work on a
52 qualified project if all or part of the costs of the qualified project are paid for using
53 a loan or other financial assistance from the Bank. (NRS 226.826) Section 21 of
54 this bill provides an exception so that the requirement to pay prevailing wages do
55 not apply to any contract for construction work on a qualified project relating to
56 attainable housing if the qualified borrower demonstrates that the qualified project
57 addresses a need for critical infrastructure in an area with a shortage of attainable
58 housing. Section 21 also authorizes the Bank to give a preference for approval to
59 such a qualified project if the qualified borrower, contractor and subcontractors
60 agree to pay prevailing wages.
61 Existing law sets forth certain procedures for a board of county commissioners
62 or governing body of a city to sell or lease real property. (NRS 244.281, 268.061)
63 Sections 23 and 26 of this bill require, before approving the sale or lease of real
64 property for the development of attainable housing, in addition to other procedures,
65 the board or governing body to evaluate the capacity and commitment of the
66 developer to provide long-term benefits to the county in a manner that promotes
67 transparency and does not interfere with equitable competition. Sections 23 and 26
68 also require the developer to submit certain information to the board or governing
69 body.
70 Existing law authorizes a nonprofit organization to submit to a board of county
71 commissioners or governing body of a city an application for conveyance of certain
72 property that is owned by the county. The board or governing body may approve
73 such an application if the nonprofit organization demonstrates that the organization
74 or its assignee will use the property to develop affordable housing. (NRS 244.287,
75 268.058) Sections 24 and 25 of this bill: (1) instead authorize the board or
76 governing body to approve such an application for attainable housing; and (2)
77 require an application to include certain information.
78 Existing law makes the prevailing wage requirements applicable to certain
79 construction projects that are not public works, including certain projects in a local
80 improvement district that are funded by the issuance of bonds or otherwise financed
81 through the levy of assessments on property within the district. (NRS 271.710)
82 Section 27 of this bill provides that if more than 85 percent of the cost of the
83 project is funded from assessments generated within the district, the prevailing
84 wage requirements do not apply to the project.
85 Existing law establishes three tiers of affordable housing for various purposes
86 in existing law and defines “affordable housing” as housing that falls within any of
87 the three tiers. (NRS 232.860, 244.189, 244.287, 268.058, 268.190, 278.0105,
88 279.385, 279A.020, 279B.020, 315.9625, 319.042) Section 33 of this bill revises
89 the term “affordable housing” to be “attainable housing.”
90 Under existing law, the tiers are based on both household income and the costs
91 of housing as a percentage of that income. With respect to household income: (1)
92 “tier one affordable housing” is housing for a household which has a total monthly
93 gross income that is equal to not more than 60 percent of the median monthly gross
94 household income for the county in which the housing is located, which is
95 commonly known as the area median household income; (2) “tier two affordable
96 housing” is housing for a household which has a total monthly gross income that is
-
*AB540*
– 4 –
97 equal to more than 60 percent but not more than 80 percent of the area median
98 household income; and (3) “tier three affordable housing” is housing for a
99 household which has a total monthly gross income that is equal to more than 80
100 percent but not more than 120 percent of the area median household income. In
101 addition, with respect to the costs of housing, affordable housing under existing law
102 is housing that costs not more than 30 percent of the total monthly gross household
103 income of the household with an income at the maximum percentage of the area
104 median household income for the tier. (NRS 278.01902, 278.01904, 278,01906)
105 Section 29 of this bill creates a new tier of affordable housing, to be known as “tier
106 four affordable housing,” that addresses housing for a household that has a total
107 monthly gross income that is equal to not more than 120 percent but not more than
108 150 percent of the area median household income.
109 Existing law sets forth an approval process for the subdivision of land that
110 requires a subdivider to submit a tentative map to the planning commission or
111 governing body of a county or city, as applicable. (NRS 278.330) Existing law also
112 requires the tentative map to be forwarded to certain state agencies and local
113 governments for review. (NRS 278.335) Section 31 of this bill requires each
114 reviewing agency to adopt a process for the expedited review of and comment on a
115 tentative map that includes attainable housing.
116 Existing law requires the governing body of each county and city, on or before
117 July 1, 2024, to enact by ordinance an expedited process for the consideration and
118 approval of projects for affordable housing. (Section 12 of Assembly Bill No. 213,
119 chapter 200, Statutes of Nevada 2023, at p. 1171) Section 30 of this bill requires
120 the governing body of each county and the governing body of each city to adopt an
121 expedited process for the consideration and approval of projects for attainable
122 housing.
123 Section 32 of this bill applies the definitions of certain terms relating to
124 planning and zoning to sections 29-31.
125 Sections 34-36 of this bill, respectively, revise the definitions of “tier one
126 affordable housing,” “tier three affordable housing” and “tier two affordable
127 housing” to provide that the costs of such housing may be offset by certain energy
128 cost savings.
129 Existing law requires the governing body of certain cities and counties to adopt
130 at least 6 of 12 specified measures in implementing a plan for maintaining and
131 developing affordable housing, which may include a measure to reduce or subsidize
132 impact fees, fees for the issuance of building permits and fees imposed for the
133 purpose for which an enterprise fund was created. (NRS 278.235) Section 37 of
134 this bill authorizes that the governing body of such a county or city include a
135 measure to also reimburse such fees.
136 Existing law sets forth the requirements for obtaining a contractor’s license
137 from the State Contractors’ Board. (Chapter 624 of NRS) Section 39 of this bill
138 requires, under certain circumstances, the Board to issue a contractor’s license by
139 endorsement to certain applicants who will perform work in a rural area. Section 40
140 of this bill provides that, if the Director of the Department of Business and Industry
141 determines that there is a shortage of skilled labor or licensed contractors in a rural
142 area that is adversely impacting the availability of attainable housing for essential
143 workers who are employed in the area, the Director may issue a declaration of such
144 shortage for not more than 3 years. Upon such a declaration, the Board is required
145 to implement a process to issue provisional contractors’ licenses to certain
146 applicants.
147 Sections 41 and 42 of this bill make conforming changes to exempt the license
148 by endorsement issued pursuant to section 39 or a provisional license issued
149 pursuant to section 40 from certain licensing requirements and the expiration date
150 that generally apply to contractors’ licenses. Sections 40 and 42-46 of this bill
151 exempt applicants for a new contractor’s license and existing licensed contractors
-

152 in rural areas from any application, license or renewal fee or certain other fees
153 relating to a contractor’s license under circumstances where the Director of the
154 Department of Business and Industry has issued a declaration of shortage pursuant
155 to section 40.
156 Sections 48 and 49 of this bill require the Board to: (1) adopt regulations to
157 carry out the provisions of sections 39 and 40 before January 1, 2026; and (2)
158 submit a report to the Governor and Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau that
159 includes a recommendation as to whether the requirements to issue such licenses by
160 endorsement and provisional licenses, as required by sections 39 and 40, should be
161 continued, modified or terminated.

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law charges the Housing Division of the Department of Business and
2 Industry with certain duties relating to low-income housing and affordable housing.
3 (Chapter 319 of NRS) Section 9 of this bill creates the Nevada Attainable Housing
4 Account in the State General Fund, to be administered by the Division. Section 10
5 of this bill authorizes the Division to distribute money in the Account to eligible
6 entities for expenditures relating to attainable housing. Section 50 of this bill
7 appropriates $200,000,000 to the Account for the purposes of section 10.
8 Section 11 of this bill requires the Administrator of the Division to adopt an
9 annual allocation plan for disbursing money from the Account. Section 22 of this
10 bill exempts the Division from complying with the provisions of the Administrative
11 Procedures Act in adopting the annual allocation plan.
12 Section 12 of this bill requires, with certain exceptions, that an eligible entity
13 provide or secure matching funds in an amount not less than the amount of the
14 money awarded to the eligible entity from the Account.
15 Section 13 of this bill provides, with certain exceptions, that any attainable
16 housing project that receives money from the Account is not a public work and is
17 exempt from the requirements to pay prevailing wages.
18 Section 14 of this bill authorizes the Division to adopt regulations setting forth
19 standards and requirements for any program for rental assistance or eviction
20 diversion that receives funding from the Account.
21 Section 15 of this bill: (1) creates the Nevada Attainable Housing Council to
22 provide oversight and strategic guidance for the administration and allocation of the
23 Account; and (2) sets forth the membership of the Council.
24 Section 16 of this bill: (1) prohibits a member of the Council from having a
25 direct financial interest in any attainable housing project or eligible entity that
26 applies for or receives funding from the Account; and (2) requires the Division to
27 establish procedures to ensure that any member of the Council discloses any direct
28 or indirect financial interest in any attainable housing project or eligible entity that
29 applies for or receives funding from the Account.
30 Section 17 of this bill requires the Council to: (1) review and comment on
31 certain housing reports; and (2) provide recommendations to the Division regarding
32 the allocation and use of money from the Account.
33 Existing law authorizes, with certain exceptions, the Division to: (1) establish
34 certain funds or accounts; and (2) invest or deposit its money, but does not require
35 the Division to keep any of its money in the State Treasury. (NRS 319.170) Section
36 18 of this bill creates an additional exception to these provisions for the Account
37 created by section 9.
38 Sections 2-8 of this bill define certain terms relating to the provisions of

42 Existing law creates the Nevada State Infrastructure Bank within the Office of
43 the State Treasurer, the purpose of which is to provide loans and other financial
44 assistance to qualified borrowers for the development, construction, repair,
45 improvement, operation, maintenance decommissioning and ownership of certain
46 transportation facilities, utility infrastructure, water and wastewater infrastructure,
47 renewable energy infrastructure, recycling and sustainability infrastructure, digital
48 infrastructure, K-12 school facilities, social infrastructure and other infrastructure
49 related to economic development as necessary for public purposes. (NRS 226.778)
50 Existing law further provides that provisions of law that require the payment of
51 prevailing wages to skilled labor apply to any contract for construction work on a
52 qualified project if all or part of the costs of the qualified project are paid for using
53 a loan or other financial assistance from the Bank. (NRS 226.826) Section 21 of
54 this bill provides an exception so that the requirement to pay prevailing wages do
55 not apply to any contract for construction work on a qualified project relating to
56 attainable housing if the qualified borrower demonstrates that the qualified project
57 addresses a need for critical infrastructure in an area with a shortage of attainable
58 housing. Section 21 also authorizes the Bank to give a preference for approval to
59 such a qualified project if the qualified borrower, contractor and subcontractors
60 agree to pay prevailing wages.
61 Existing law sets forth certain procedures for a board of county commissioners
62 or governing body of a city to sell or lease real property. (NRS 244.281, 268.061)
63 Sections 23 and 26 of this bill require, before approving the sale or lease of real
64 property for the development of attainable housing, in addition to other procedures,
65 the board or governing body to evaluate the capacity and commitment of the
66 developer to provide long-term benefits to the county in a manner that promotes
67 transparency and does not interfere with equitable competition. Sections 23 and 26
68 also require the developer to submit certain information to the board or governing
69 body.
70 Existing law authorizes a nonprofit organization to submit to a board of county
71 commissioners or governing body of a city an application for conveyance of certain
72 property that is owned by the county. The board or governing body may approve
73 such an application if the nonprofit organization demonstrates that the organization
74 or its assignee will use the property to develop affordable housing. (NRS 244.287,
75 268.058) Sections 24 and 25 of this bill: (1) instead authorize the board or
76 governing body to approve such an application for attainable housing; and (2)
77 require an application to include certain information.
78 Existing law makes the prevailing wage requirements applicable to certain
79 construction projects that are not public works, including certain projects in a local
80 improvement district that are funded by the issuance of bonds or otherwise financed
81 through the levy of assessments on property within the district. (NRS 271.710)
82 Section 27 of this bill provides that if more than 85 percent of the cost of the
83 project is funded from assessments generated within the district, the prevailing
84 wage requirements do not apply to the project.
85 Existing law establishes three tiers of affordable housing for various purposes
86 in existing law and defines “affordable housing” as housing that falls within any of
87 the three tiers. (NRS 232.860, 244.189, 244.287, 268.058, 268.190, 278.0105,
88 279.385, 279A.020, 279B.020, 315.9625, 319.042) Section 33 of this bill revises
89 the term “affordable housing” to be “attainable housing.”
90 Under existing law, the tiers are based on both household income and the costs
91 of housing as a percentage of that income. With respect to household income: (1)
92 “tier one affordable housing” is housing for a household which has a total monthly
93 gross income that is equal to not more than 60 percent of the median monthly gross
94 household income for the county in which the housing is located, which is
95 commonly known as the area median household income; (2) “tier two affordable
96 housing” is housing for a household which has a total monthly gross income that is
-
*AB540*

– 4 –
97 equal to more than 60 percent but not more than 80 percent of the area median
98 household income; and (3) “tier three affordable housing” is housing for a
99 household which has a total monthly gross income that is equal to more than 80
100 percent but not more than 120 percent of the area median household income. In
101 addition, with respect to the costs of housing, affordable housing under existing law
102 is housing that costs not more than 30 percent of the total monthly gross household
103 income of the household with an income at the maximum percentage of the area
104 median household income for the tier. (NRS 278.01902, 278.01904, 278,01906)
105 Section 29 of this bill creates a new tier of affordable housing, to be known as “tier
106 four affordable housing,” that addresses housing for a household that has a total
107 monthly gross income that is equal to not more than 120 percent but not more than
108 150 percent of the area median household income.
109 Existing law sets forth an approval process for the subdivision of land that
110 requires a subdivider to submit a tentative map to the planning commission or
111 governing body of a county or city, as applicable. (NRS 278.330) Existing law also
112 requires the tentative map to be forwarded to certain state agencies and local
113 governments for review. (NRS 278.335) Section 31 of this bill requires each
114 reviewing agency to adopt a process for the expedited review of and comment on a
115 tentative map that includes attainable housing.
116 Existing law requires the governing body of each county and city, on or before
117 July 1, 2024, to enact by ordinance an expedited process for the consideration and
118 approval of projects for affordable housing. (Section 12 of Assembly Bill No. 213,
119 chapter 200, Statutes of Nevada 2023, at p. 1171) Section 30 of this bill requires
120 the governing body of each county and the governing body of each city to adopt an
121 expedited process for the consideration and approval of projects for attainable
122 housing.
123 Section 32 of this bill applies the definitions of certain terms relating to
124 planning and zoning to sections 29-31.
125 Sections 34-36 of this bill, respectively, revise the definitions of “tier one
126 affordable housing,” “tier three affordable housing” and “tier two affordable
127 housing” to provide that the costs of such housing may be offset by certain energy
128 cost savings.
129 Existing law requires the governing body of certain cities and counties to adopt
130 at least 6 of 12 specified measures in implementing a plan for maintaining and
131 developing affordable housing, which may include a measure to reduce or subsidize
132 impact fees, fees for the issuance of building permits and fees imposed for the
133 purpose for which an enterprise fund was created. (NRS 278.235) Section 37 of
134 this bill authorizes that the governing body of such a county or city include a
135 measure to also reimburse such fees.
136 Existing law sets forth the requirements for obtaining a contractor’s license
137 from the State Contractors’ Board. (Chapter 624 of NRS) Section 39 of this bill
138 requires, under certain circumstances, the Board to issue a contractor’s license by
139 endorsement to certain applicants who will perform work in a rural area. Section 40
140 of this bill provides that, if the Director of the Department of Business and Industry
141 determines that there is a shortage of skilled labor or licensed contractors in a rural
142 area that is adversely impacting the availability of attainable housing for essential
143 workers who are employed in the area, the Director may issue a declaration of such
144 shortage for not more than 3 years. Upon such a declaration, the Board is required
145 to implement a process to issue provisional contractors’ licenses to certain
146 applicants.
147 Sections 41 and 42 of this bill make conforming changes to exempt the license
148 by endorsement issued pursuant to section 39 or a provisional license issued
149 pursuant to section 40 from certain licensing requirements and the expiration date
150 that generally apply to contractors’ licenses. Sections 40 and 42-46 of this bill
151 exempt applicants for a new contractor’s license and existing licensed contractors
-

– 5 –
152 in rural areas from any application, license or renewal fee or certain other fees
153 relating to a contractor’s license under circumstances where the Director of the
154 Department of Business and Industry has issued a declaration of shortage pursuant
155 to section 40.
156 Sections 48 and 49 of this bill require the Board to: (1) adopt regulations to
157 carry out the provisions of sections 39 and 40 before January 1, 2026; and (2)
158 submit a report to the Governor and Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau that
159 includes a recommendation as to whether the requirements to issue such licenses by
160 endorsement and provisional licenses, as required by sections 39 and 40, should be
161 continued, modified or terminated.
