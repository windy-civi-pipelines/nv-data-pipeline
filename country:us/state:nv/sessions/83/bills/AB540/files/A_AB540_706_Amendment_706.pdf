Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law charges the Housing Division of the Department of Business and Industry
2 with certain duties relating to low-income housing and affordable housing. (Chapter 319 of
3 NRS) Section 9 of this bill creates the Nevada Attainable Housing Account in the State
4 General Fund, to be administered by the Division. Section 10 of this bill authorizes the
5 Division to distribute money in the Account to eligible entities for certain expenditures
6 relating to attainable housing. Section 50 of this bill appropriates [$200,000,000]
7 $150,000,000 to the Account . [for the purposes of section 10.]
8 Section 11 of this bill requires the Administrator of the Division to adopt an annual
9 allocation plan for disbursing money from the Account. Section 50.5 of this bill requires the
10 Division to include in the initial allocation plan adopted pursuant to section 11 certain
11 allocations of money from the Account for certain purposes authorized by section 10.
12 Section 22 of this bill exempts the Division from complying with the provisions of the
13 Administrative Procedures Act in adopting the annual allocation plan.
14 Section 12 of this bill requires [, with certain exceptions,] that an eligible entity provide
15 or secure matching funds in an amount not less than the amount of the money awarded to the
16 eligible entity from the Account.
17 [Section 13 of this bill provides, with certain exceptions, that any attainable housing
18 project that receives money from the Account is not a public work and is exempt from the
19 requirements to pay prevailing wages.
20 Section 14 of this bill authorizes the Division to adopt regulations setting forth standards
21 and requirements for any program for rental assistance or eviction diversion that receives
22 funding from the Account.]
23 Section 14.5 of this bill requires the Division to submit a report of certain
24 information to the Interim Finance Committee at the last meeting of each fiscal year and
25 the last meeting of each calendar year relating to the Account.
26 Section 15 of this bill: (1) creates the Nevada Attainable Housing Council to provide
27 oversight and strategic guidance for the administration and allocation of the Account; and (2)
28 sets forth the membership of the Council.
29 Section 16 of this bill [: (1) prohibits a member of the Council from having a direct
30 financial interest in any attainable housing project or eligible entity that applies for or receives
31 funding from the Account; and (2)] requires the Division to establish procedures to ensure that
32 any member of the Council discloses any direct or indirect financial interest in any attainable
33 housing project or eligible entity that applies for or receives funding from the Account.
34 Section 17 of this bill requires the Council to: (1) review and comment on certain housing
35 reports; and (2) provide recommendations to the Division regarding the allocation and use of
36 money from the Account.
37 Existing law authorizes, with certain exceptions, the Division to: (1) establish certain
38 funds or accounts; and (2) invest or deposit its money, but does not require the Division to
39 keep any of its money in the State Treasury. (NRS 319.170) Section 18 of this bill creates an
40 additional exception to these provisions for the Account created by section 9.
41 Sections 2-8 of this bill define certain terms relating to the provisions of sections 2-17.
42 Sections 19 and 20 of this bill authorize the Division to establish a program for the
43 reporting of rental payments to a credit reporting agency.
44 [Existing law creates the Nevada State Infrastructure Bank within the Office of the State
45 Treasurer, the purpose of which is to provide loans and other financial assistance to qualified
46 borrowers for the development, construction, repair, improvement, operation, maintenance
47 decommissioning and ownership of certain transportation facilities, utility infrastructure,
48 water and wastewater infrastructure, renewable energy infrastructure, recycling and
49 sustainability infrastructure, digital infrastructure, K-12 school facilities, social infrastructure
50 and other infrastructure related to economic development as necessary for public purposes.
51 (NRS 226.778) Existing law further provides that provisions of law that require the payment

Assembly Amendment No. 706 to Assembly Bill No. 540 Page 5
52 of prevailing wages to skilled labor apply to any contract for construction work on a qualified
53 project if all or part of the costs of the qualified project are paid for using a loan or other
54 financial assistance from the Bank. (NRS 226.826) Section 21 of this bill provides an
55 exception so that the requirement to pay prevailing wages do not apply to any contract for
56 construction work on a qualified project relating to attainable housing if the qualified
57 borrower demonstrates that the qualified project addresses a need for critical infrastructure in
58 an area with a shortage of attainable housing. Section 21 also authorizes the Bank to give a
59 preference for approval to such a qualified project if the qualified borrower, contractor and
60 subcontractors agree to pay prevailing wages.]
61 Existing law sets forth certain procedures for a board of county commissioners or
62 governing body of a city to sell or lease real property. (NRS 244.281, 268.061) Sections 23
63 and 26 of this bill require, before approving the sale or lease of real property for the
64 development of attainable housing, in addition to other procedures, the board or governing
65 body to evaluate the capacity and commitment of the developer to provide long-term benefits
66 to the county in a manner that promotes transparency and does not interfere with equitable
67 competition. Sections 23 and 26 also require the developer to submit certain information to
68 the board or governing body.
69 Existing law authorizes a nonprofit organization to submit to a board of county
70 commissioners or governing body of a city an application for conveyance of certain property
71 that is owned by the county. The board or governing body may approve such an application if
72 the nonprofit organization demonstrates that the organization or its assignee will use the
73 property to develop affordable housing. (NRS 244.287, 268.058) Sections 24 and 25 of this
74 bill: (1) instead authorize the board or governing body to approve such an application for
75 attainable housing; and (2) require an application to include certain information.
76 [Existing law makes the prevailing wage requirements applicable to certain construction
77 projects that are not public works, including certain projects in a local improvement district
78 that are funded by the issuance of bonds or otherwise financed through the levy of
79 assessments on property within the district. (NRS 271.710) Section 27 of this bill provides
80 that if more than 85 percent of the cost of the project is funded from assessments generated
81 within the district, the prevailing wage requirements do not apply to the project.]
82 Existing law establishes three tiers of affordable housing for various purposes in existing
83 law and defines “affordable housing” as housing that falls within any of the three tiers. (NRS
84 232.860, 244.189, 244.287, 268.058, 268.190, 278.0105, 279.385, 279A.020, 279B.020,
85 315.9625, 319.042) Section 33 of this bill revises the term “affordable housing” to be
86 “attainable housing.”
87 Under existing law, the tiers are based on both household income and the costs of housing
88 as a percentage of that income. With respect to household income: (1) “tier one affordable
89 housing” is housing for a household which has a total monthly gross income that is equal to
90 not more than 60 percent of the median monthly gross household income for the county in
91 which the housing is located, which is commonly known as the area median household
92 income; (2) “tier two affordable housing” is housing for a household which has a total
93 monthly gross income that is equal to more than 60 percent but not more than 80 percent of
94 the area median household income; and (3) “tier three affordable housing” is housing for a
95 household which has a total monthly gross income that is equal to more than 80 percent but
96 not more than 120 percent of the area median household income. In addition, with respect to
97 the costs of housing, affordable housing under existing law is housing that costs not more than
98 30 percent of the total monthly gross household income of the household with an income at
99 the maximum percentage of the area median household income for the tier. (NRS 278.01902,
100 278.01904, 278,01906) Section 29 of this bill creates a new tier of affordable housing, to be
101 known as “tier four affordable housing,” that addresses housing for a household that has a
102 total monthly gross income that is equal to not more than 120 percent but not more than 150
103 percent of the area median household income.
104 Existing law sets forth an approval process for the subdivision of land that requires a
105 subdivider to submit a tentative map to the planning commission or governing body of a
106 county or city, as applicable. (NRS 278.330) Existing law also requires the tentative map to be
107 forwarded to certain state agencies and local governments for review. (NRS 278.335) Section
108 31 of this bill requires each reviewing agency to adopt a process for the expedited review of
109 and comment on a tentative map that includes attainable housing.

Assembly Amendment No. 706 to Assembly Bill No. 540 Page 6
110 Existing law requires the governing body of each county and city, on or before July 1,
111 2024, to enact by ordinance an expedited process for the consideration and approval of
112 projects for affordable housing. (Section 12 of Assembly Bill No. 213, chapter 200, Statutes
113 of Nevada 2023, at p. 1171) Section 30 of this bill requires the governing body of each county
114 and the governing body of each city to adopt an expedited process for the consideration and
115 approval of projects for attainable housing.
116 Section 32 of this bill applies the definitions of certain terms relating to planning and
117 zoning to sections 29-31.
118 Sections 34-36 of this bill, respectively, revise the definitions of “tier one affordable
119 housing,” “tier three affordable housing” and “tier two affordable housing” to provide that the
120 costs of such housing may be offset by certain energy cost savings.
121 Existing law requires the governing body of certain cities and counties to adopt at least 6
122 of 12 specified measures in implementing a plan for maintaining and developing affordable
123 housing, which may include a measure to reduce or subsidize impact fees, fees for the
124 issuance of building permits and fees imposed for the purpose for which an enterprise fund
125 was created. (NRS 278.235) Section 37 of this bill authorizes that the governing body of such
126 a county or city include a measure to also reimburse such fees.
127 Existing law sets forth the requirements for obtaining a contractor’s license from the State
128 Contractors’ Board. (Chapter 624 of NRS) Section 39 of this bill requires, under certain
129 circumstances, the Board to issue a contractor’s license by endorsement to certain applicants
130 who will perform work on an attainable housing project in [a] certain rural [area.] areas.
131 Section 40 of this bill provides that, if the Director of the Department of Business and
132 Industry determines that there is a shortage of skilled labor or licensed contractors in a rural
133 area that is adversely impacting the availability of attainable housing for essential workers
134 who are employed in the area, the Director may issue a declaration of such shortage for not
135 more than 3 years. Upon such a declaration, the Board is required to implement a process to
136 issue provisional contractors’ licenses to certain applicants [.] who will perform work on an
137 attainable housing project in certain rural areas.
138 Sections 41 and 42 of this bill [make conforming changes to] exempt the license by
139 endorsement issued pursuant to section 39 or a provisional license issued pursuant to section
140 40 from certain licensing requirements and the expiration date that generally apply to
141 contractors’ licenses. Sections [40 and] 42-46 of this bill exempt applicants for a new
142 contractor’s license and existing licensed contractors in rural areas from any application,
143 license or renewal fee or certain other fees relating to a contractor’s license under
144 circumstances where the Director of the Department of Business and Industry has issued a
145 declaration of shortage pursuant to section 40.
146 Sections 48 and 49 of this bill require the Board to: (1) adopt regulations to carry out the
147 provisions of sections 39 and 40 before January 1, 2026; and (2) submit a report to the
148 Governor and Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau that includes a recommendation as
149 to whether the requirements to issue such licenses by endorsement and provisional licenses, as
150 required by sections 39 and 40, should be continued, modified or terminated.
