Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law charges the Housing Division of the Department of Business and
2 Industry with certain duties relating to low-income housing and affordable housing.
3 (Chapter 319 of NRS) Section 9 of this bill creates the Nevada Attainable Housing
4 Account in the State General Fund, to be administered by the Division. Section 10
5 of this bill authorizes the Division to distribute money in the Account to eligible
6 entities for certain expenditures relating to attainable housing. Section 50 of this
7 bill appropriates $133,000,000 to the Account.
8 Section 11 of this bill requires the Administrator of the Division to adopt an
9 annual allocation plan for disbursing money from the Account. Section 50.5 of this
10 bill requires the Division to include in the initial allocation plan adopted pursuant to
11 section 11 certain allocations of money from the Account for certain purposes
12 authorized by section 10.
13 Section 22 of this bill exempts the Division from complying with the
14 provisions of the Administrative Procedures Act in adopting the annual allocation
15 plan.
16 Section 12 of this bill requires that an eligible entity provide or secure
17 matching funds in an amount not less than the amount of the money awarded to the
18 eligible entity from the Account.
19 Section 14.5 of this bill requires the Division to submit a report of certain
20 information to the Interim Finance Committee at the last meeting of each fiscal year
21 and the last meeting of each calendar year relating to the Account.
22 Section 15 of this bill: (1) creates the Nevada Attainable Housing Council to
23 provide oversight and strategic guidance for the administration and allocation of the
24 Account; and (2) sets forth the membership of the Council.
25 Section 16 of this bill requires the Division to establish procedures to ensure
26 that any member of the Council discloses any direct or indirect financial interest in
27 any attainable housing project or eligible entity that applies for or receives funding
28 from the Account.
29 Section 17 of this bill requires the Council to: (1) review and comment on
30 certain housing reports; and (2) provide recommendations to the Division regarding
31 the allocation and use of money from the Account.
32 Existing law creates the position of Housing Advocate within the Division and
33 establishes the duties for the position, which include providing information and
-
*AB540_R3*

– 3 –
34 assistance to persons who reside in affordable housing and manufactured housing.
35 (NRS 319.141) Section 17.3 of this bill renames the position of Housing Advocate
36 as the Housing Liaison.
37 Existing law requires the Division to create and maintain a statewide low-
38 income housing database. The database is required to include certain information
39 relating to low-income housing, including compilations and analysis of
40 demographic, economic and housing data from a variety of sources. (NRS 319.143)
41 Section 17.6 of this bill requires the inclusion of any survey conducted by the
42 Division in the database. Section 17.6 also revises the data that is required to be
43 included in the database by: (1) changing the measure for determining the number
44 of households in various population groups experiencing high housing costs from
45 50 percent to 30 percent of household income; (2) increasing from 2 years to 3
46 years the length of the planning period for identifying when subsidized units are
47 forecast to convert to market-rate units; and (3) adding information regarding
48 certain multi-family residential housing. Section 17.6 further requires the Division,
49 on or before December 31 of each year, to analyze the data in the database and
50 prepare and post on its website a report of its analysis.
51 Existing law authorizes, with certain exceptions, the Division to: (1) establish
52 certain funds or accounts; and (2) invest or deposit its money, but does not require
53 the Division to keep any of its money in the State Treasury. (NRS 319.170) Section
54 18 of this bill creates an additional exception to these provisions for the Account
55 created by section 9.
56 Existing law creates the Account for Affordable Housing in the State General
57 Fund, which is required to be administered by the Division, and prescribes the
58 distribution and use of money in the Account. (NRS 319.500, 319.510) Under
59 existing law, the costs to create and maintain the statewide low-income housing
60 database are required to be paid from the Account up to a maximum of $175,000
61 per year. (NRS 319.143, 319.510) Sections 17.6 and 18.5 of this bill: (1) require
62 payment from the Account of the costs to prepare the new annual report required by
63 section 17.6; and (2) change the maximum annual amount authorized from the
64 Account for the payment of costs related to the database from the fixed amount of
65 $175,000 to not more than 6 percent of the money deposited in the Account in each
66 fiscal year.
67 Existing law also authorizes the Division to expend not more than $40,000 per
68 year or an amount equal to 6 percent of money received pursuant to the federal
69 HOME Investment Partnerships Act, whichever is greater, as reimbursement for
70 administering the Account and that federal money. (NRS 319.510; 42 U.S.C. §§
71 12701 et seq.) Section 18.5: (1) eliminates the authority of the Division to receive
72 reimbursement from the Account for administering that federal money; and (2)
73 changes the maximum amount authorized from the Account as reimbursement for
74 administering the Account to not more than 6 percent of the money deposited in the
75 Account in each fiscal year.
76 Existing law requires the Division to distribute a certain portion of the
77 remaining money in the Account to the Division of Welfare and Supportive
78 Services of the Department of Health and Human Services for a program to provide
79 emergency assistance to needy families with children. (NRS 319.510) Section 18.5
80 eliminates this required distribution to the Division for this program, but
81 specifically authorizes the use of money in the Account for the same purpose. With
82 the elimination of this distribution to the Division, all of the remaining money in
83 the Account will effectively be distributed to the other authorized recipients in
84 existing law, which are certain charitable organizations, housing authorities and
85 local governments for the acquisition, construction and rehabilitation of affordable
86 housing for eligible families, subject to certain requirements. One such eligibility
87 requirement in existing law is that not less than 15 percent of the units acquired,
88 constructed or rehabilitated be affordable to persons whose income is at or below
-
*AB540_R3*

– 4 –
89 the federally designated level signifying poverty. (NRS 319.510) Section 18.5: (1)
90 changes the income level for that requirement to be at or below 30 percent of the
91 median monthly gross household income for the applicable county; and (2) clarifies
92 that the money is authorized to be distributed to one or more of the types of entities
93 that are eligible recipients. Section 18.5 also eliminates the eligibility requirement
94 in existing law that a local government sponsor such a project.
95 Sections 2-8 of this bill define certain terms relating to the provisions of
96 sections 2-17.
97 Sections 19 and 20 of this bill authorize the Division to establish a program for
98 the reporting of rental payments to a credit reporting agency.
99 Existing law sets forth certain procedures for a board of county commissioners
100 or governing body of a city to sell or lease real property. (NRS 244.281, 268.061)
101 Sections 23 and 26 of this bill require, before approving the sale or lease of real
102 property for the development of attainable housing, in addition to other procedures,
103 the board or governing body to evaluate the capacity and commitment of the
104 developer to provide long-term benefits to the county in a manner that promotes
105 transparency and does not interfere with equitable competition. Sections 23 and 26
106 also require the developer to submit certain information to the board or governing
107 body.
108 Existing law authorizes a nonprofit organization to submit to a board of county
109 commissioners or governing body of a city an application for conveyance of certain
110 property that is owned by the county or city, as applicable. The board or governing
111 body may approve such an application if the nonprofit organization demonstrates
112 that the organization or its assignee will use the property to develop affordable
113 housing. (NRS 244.287, 268.058) Sections 24 and 25 of this bill: (1) instead
114 authorize the board or governing body to approve such an application for attainable
115 housing; and (2) require an application to include certain information.
116 Existing law establishes three tiers of affordable housing for various purposes
117 in existing law and defines “affordable housing” as housing that falls within any of
118 the three tiers. (NRS 232.860, 244.189, 244.287, 268.058, 268.190, 278.0105,
119 279.385, 279A.020, 279B.020, 315.9625, 319.042) Section 33 of this bill revises
120 the term “affordable housing” to be “attainable housing.”
121 Under existing law, the tiers are based on both household income and the costs
122 of housing as a percentage of that income. With respect to household income: (1)
123 “tier one affordable housing” is housing for a household which has a total monthly
124 gross income that is equal to not more than 60 percent of the median monthly gross
125 household income for the county in which the housing is located, which is
126 commonly known as the area median household income; (2) “tier two affordable
127 housing” is housing for a household which has a total monthly gross income that is
128 equal to more than 60 percent but not more than 80 percent of the area median
129 household income; and (3) “tier three affordable housing” is housing for a
130 household which has a total monthly gross income that is equal to more than 80
131 percent but not more than 120 percent of the area median household income. In
132 addition, with respect to the costs of housing, affordable housing under existing law
133 is housing that costs not more than 30 percent of the total monthly gross household
134 income of the household with an income at the maximum percentage of the area
135 median household income for the tier. (NRS 278.01902, 278.01904, 278,01906)
136 Section 29.5 of this bill creates a new tier of affordable housing, to be known as
137 “tier one affordable housing,” that addresses housing for a household that has a
138 total monthly gross income that is equal to not more than 30 percent of the area
139 median household income. As a result of the creation of this new tier of affordable
140 housing, section 34 of this bill renames “tier one affordable housing” in existing
141 law as “tier two affordable housing” and changes the percentage range for median
142 income for that tier to more than 30 percent but not more than 60 percent of the
143 area median household income. Section 36 of this bill renames “tier two affordable
-
*AB540_R3*

– 5 –
144 housing” in existing law for which the percentage range for median income is more
145 than 60 percent, but not more than 80 percent of the area median household
146 income, as “tier three affordable housing.” Section 35 of this bill renames “tier
147 three affordable housing” in existing law, for which the percentage range for
148 median income is more than 80 percent but not more than 120 percent of the area
149 median household income, as “tier four affordable housing.”
150 Section 29 of this bill creates a new tier of affordable housing, to be known as
151 “tier five affordable housing,” that addresses housing for a household that has a
152 total monthly gross income that is equal to not more than 120 percent but not more
153 than 150 percent of the area median household income.
154 Section 37.5 of this bill makes a conforming change to reflect the changes in
155 the tiers.
156 Existing law sets forth an approval process for the subdivision of land that
157 requires a subdivider to submit a tentative map to the planning commission or
158 governing body of a county or city, as applicable. (NRS 278.330) Existing law also
159 requires the tentative map to be forwarded to certain state agencies and local
160 governments for review. (NRS 278.335) Section 31 of this bill requires each
161 reviewing agency to adopt a process for the expedited review of and comment on a
162 tentative map that includes attainable housing.
163 Existing law requires the governing body of each county and city, on or before
164 July 1, 2024, to enact by ordinance an expedited process for the consideration and
165 approval of projects for affordable housing. (Section 12 of Assembly Bill No. 213,
166 chapter 200, Statutes of Nevada 2023, at p. 1171) Section 30 of this bill requires
167 the governing body of each county and the governing body of each city to adopt an
168 expedited process for the consideration and approval of projects for attainable
169 housing.
170 Section 32 of this bill applies the definitions of certain terms relating to
171 planning and zoning and the newly defined terms in sections 29 and 29.5 to
172 sections 29-31.
173 Sections 34-36 of this bill, respectively, revise the definitions of “tier one
174 affordable housing,” “tier three affordable housing” and “tier two affordable
175 housing” to provide that the costs of such housing may be offset by certain energy
176 cost savings.
177 Existing law requires the governing body of certain cities and counties to adopt
178 at least 6 of 12 specified measures in implementing a plan for maintaining and
179 developing affordable housing, which may include a measure to reduce or subsidize
180 impact fees, fees for the issuance of building permits and fees imposed for the
181 purpose for which an enterprise fund was created. (NRS 278.235) Section 37 of
182 this bill authorizes that the governing body of such a county or city include a
183 measure to also reimburse such fees.
184 Existing law requires the governing body of certain cities or counties to submit
185 to the Division annual progress reports relating to affordable housing. (NRS
186 278.235) Existing law requires: (1) the inclusion of these reports in the statewide
187 low-income housing database; and (2) the Division to compile and post these
188 reports on its Internet website. (NRS 278.235, 319.143) Section 37 moves the
189 deadline for: (1) the submission of the reports to the Division from July 15 to
190 March 15; and (2) the posting of the compilation of the reports by the Division
191 from August 15 to April 15. The new deadlines apply starting in 2026, as section
192 49.5 of this bill requires: (1) the governing body of a city or county to submit the
193 2025 report to the Division on or before July 15, 2025; and (2) the Division to
194 compile the reports and post the compilation on the Internet website of the Division
195 on or before August 15, 2025.
196 Existing law sets forth the requirements for obtaining a contractor’s license
197 from the State Contractors’ Board. (Chapter 624 of NRS) Section 39 of this bill
198 requires, under certain circumstances, the Board to issue a contractor’s license by
-

– 6 –
199 endorsement to certain applicants who will perform work on an attainable housing
200 project in certain rural areas.
201 Section 40 of this bill provides that, if the Director of the Department of
202 Business and Industry determines that there is a shortage of skilled labor or licensed
203 contractors in a rural area that is adversely impacting the availability of attainable
204 housing for essential workers who are employed in the area, the Director may issue
205 a declaration of such shortage for not more than 3 years. Upon such a declaration,
206 the Board is required to implement a process to issue provisional contractors’
207 licenses to certain applicants who will perform work on an attainable housing
208 project in certain rural areas.
209 Sections 41 and 42 of this bill exempt the license by endorsement issued
210 pursuant to section 39 or a provisional license issued pursuant to section 40 from
211 certain licensing requirements and the expiration date that generally apply to
212 contractors’ licenses. Sections 42-46 of this bill exempt applicants for a new
213 contractor’s license and existing licensed contractors in rural areas from any
214 application, license or renewal fee or certain other fees relating to a contractor’s
215 license under circumstances where the Director of the Department of Business and
216 Industry has issued a declaration of shortage pursuant to section 40.
217 Sections 48 and 49 of this bill require the Board to: (1) adopt regulations to
218 carry out the provisions of sections 39 and 40, respectively, before January 1,
219 2026; and (2) submit a report to the Governor and Director of the Legislative
220 Counsel Bureau that includes a recommendation as to whether the requirements to
221 issue such licenses by endorsement and provisional licenses, as required by
222 sections 39 and 40, should be continued, modified or terminated.
223 Section 49.7 of this bill requires the issuance of not more than $50,000,000 in
