Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law charges the Housing Division of the Department of Business and Industry
2 with certain duties relating to low-income housing and affordable housing. (Chapter 319 of
3 NRS) Section 9 of this bill creates the Nevada Attainable Housing Account in the State
4 General Fund, to be administered by the Division. Section 10 of this bill authorizes the
5 Division to distribute money in the Account to eligible entities for certain expenditures
6 relating to attainable housing. Section 50 of this bill appropriates [$150,000,000]
7 $133,000,000 to the Account.
8 Section 11 of this bill requires the Administrator of the Division to adopt an annual
9 allocation plan for disbursing money from the Account. Section 50.5 of this bill requires the
10 Division to include in the initial allocation plan adopted pursuant to section 11 certain
11 allocations of money from the Account for certain purposes authorized by section 10.
12 Section 22 of this bill exempts the Division from complying with the provisions of the
13 Administrative Procedures Act in adopting the annual allocation plan.
14 Section 12 of this bill requires that an eligible entity provide or secure matching funds in
15 an amount not less than the amount of the money awarded to the eligible entity from the
16 Account.
17 Section 14.5 of this bill requires the Division to submit a report of certain information to
18 the Interim Finance Committee at the last meeting of each fiscal year and the last meeting of
19 each calendar year relating to the Account.
20 Section 15 of this bill: (1) creates the Nevada Attainable Housing Council to provide
21 oversight and strategic guidance for the administration and allocation of the Account; and (2)
22 sets forth the membership of the Council.
23 Section 16 of this bill requires the Division to establish procedures to ensure that any
24 member of the Council discloses any direct or indirect financial interest in any attainable
25 housing project or eligible entity that applies for or receives funding from the Account.
26 Section 17 of this bill requires the Council to: (1) review and comment on certain housing
27 reports; and (2) provide recommendations to the Division regarding the allocation and use of
28 money from the Account.
29 Existing law authorizes, with certain exceptions, the Division to: (1) establish certain
30 funds or accounts; and (2) invest or deposit its money, but does not require the Division to
31 keep any of its money in the State Treasury. (NRS 319.170) Section 18 of this bill creates an
32 additional exception to these provisions for the Account created by section 9.
33 Sections 2-8 of this bill define certain terms relating to the provisions of sections 2-17.
34 Sections 19 and 20 of this bill authorize the Division to establish a program for the
35 reporting of rental payments to a credit reporting agency.
36 Existing law sets forth certain procedures for a board of county commissioners or
37 governing body of a city to sell or lease real property. (NRS 244.281, 268.061) Sections 23
38 and 26 of this bill require, before approving the sale or lease of real property for the
39 development of attainable housing, in addition to other procedures, the board or governing
40 body to evaluate the capacity and commitment of the developer to provide long-term benefits
41 to the county in a manner that promotes transparency and does not interfere with equitable
42 competition. Sections 23 and 26 also require the developer to submit certain information to
43 the board or governing body.
44 Existing law authorizes a nonprofit organization to submit to a board of county
45 commissioners or governing body of a city an application for conveyance of certain property
46 that is owned by the county or city, as applicable. The board or governing body may approve
47 such an application if the nonprofit organization demonstrates that the organization or its
48 assignee will use the property to develop affordable housing. (NRS 244.287, 268.058)
49 Sections 24 and 25 of this bill: (1) instead authorize the board or governing body to approve
50 such an application for attainable housing; and (2) require an application to include certain
51 information.
52 Existing law establishes three tiers of affordable housing for various purposes in existing
53 law and defines “affordable housing” as housing that falls within any of the three tiers. (NRS
54 232.860, 244.189, 244.287, 268.058, 268.190, 278.0105, 279.385, 279A.020, 279B.020,
55 315.9625, 319.042) Section 33 of this bill revises the term “affordable housing” to be
56 “attainable housing.”
57 Under existing law, the tiers are based on both household income and the costs of housing
58 as a percentage of that income. With respect to household income: (1) “tier one affordable

Assembly Amendment No. 833 to Assembly Bill No. 540 First Reprint Page 5
59 housing” is housing for a household which has a total monthly gross income that is equal to
60 not more than 60 percent of the median monthly gross household income for the county in
61 which the housing is located, which is commonly known as the area median household
62 income; (2) “tier two affordable housing” is housing for a household which has a total
63 monthly gross income that is equal to more than 60 percent but not more than 80 percent of
64 the area median household income; and (3) “tier three affordable housing” is housing for a
65 household which has a total monthly gross income that is equal to more than 80 percent but
66 not more than 120 percent of the area median household income. In addition, with respect to
67 the costs of housing, affordable housing under existing law is housing that costs not more than
68 30 percent of the total monthly gross household income of the household with an income at
69 the maximum percentage of the area median household income for the tier. (NRS 278.01902,
70 278.01904, 278,01906) Section 29 of this bill creates a new tier of affordable housing, to be
71 known as “tier four affordable housing,” that addresses housing for a household that has a
72 total monthly gross income that is equal to not more than 120 percent but not more than 150
73 percent of the area median household income.
74 Existing law sets forth an approval process for the subdivision of land that requires a
75 subdivider to submit a tentative map to the planning commission or governing body of a
76 county or city, as applicable. (NRS 278.330) Existing law also requires the tentative map to be
77 forwarded to certain state agencies and local governments for review. (NRS 278.335) Section
78 31 of this bill requires each reviewing agency to adopt a process for the expedited review of
79 and comment on a tentative map that includes attainable housing.
80 Existing law requires the governing body of each county and city, on or before July 1,
81 2024, to enact by ordinance an expedited process for the consideration and approval of
82 projects for affordable housing. (Section 12 of Assembly Bill No. 213, chapter 200, Statutes
83 of Nevada 2023, at p. 1171) Section 30 of this bill requires the governing body of each county
84 and the governing body of each city to adopt an expedited process for the consideration and
85 approval of projects for attainable housing.
86 Section 32 of this bill applies the definitions of certain terms relating to planning and
87 zoning to sections 29-31.
88 Sections 34-36 of this bill, respectively, revise the definitions of “tier one affordable
89 housing,” “tier three affordable housing” and “tier two affordable housing” to provide that the
90 costs of such housing may be offset by certain energy cost savings.
91 Existing law requires the governing body of certain cities and counties to adopt at least 6
92 of 12 specified measures in implementing a plan for maintaining and developing affordable
93 housing, which may include a measure to reduce or subsidize impact fees, fees for the
94 issuance of building permits and fees imposed for the purpose for which an enterprise fund
95 was created. (NRS 278.235) Section 37 of this bill authorizes that the governing body of such
96 a county or city include a measure to also reimburse such fees.
97 Existing law sets forth the requirements for obtaining a contractor’s license from the State
98 Contractors’ Board. (Chapter 624 of NRS) Section 39 of this bill requires, under certain
99 circumstances, the Board to issue a contractor’s license by endorsement to certain applicants
100 who will perform work on an attainable housing project in certain rural areas.
101 Section 40 of this bill provides that, if the Director of the Department of Business and
102 Industry determines that there is a shortage of skilled labor or licensed contractors in a rural
103 area that is adversely impacting the availability of attainable housing for essential workers
104 who are employed in the area, the Director may issue a declaration of such shortage for not
105 more than 3 years. Upon such a declaration, the Board is required to implement a process to
106 issue provisional contractors’ licenses to certain applicants who will perform work on an
107 attainable housing project in certain rural areas.
108 Sections 41 and 42 of this bill exempt the license by endorsement issued pursuant to
109 section 39 or a provisional license issued pursuant to section 40 from certain licensing
110 requirements and the expiration date that generally apply to contractors’ licenses. Sections 42-
111 46 of this bill exempt applicants for a new contractor’s license and existing licensed
112 contractors in rural areas from any application, license or renewal fee or certain other fees
113 relating to a contractor’s license under circumstances where the Director of the Department of
114 Business and Industry has issued a declaration of shortage pursuant to section 40.
115 Sections 48 and 49 of this bill require the Board to: (1) adopt regulations to carry out the
116 provisions of sections 39 and 40, respectively, before January 1, 2026; and (2) submit a report
117 to the Governor and Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau that includes a

Assembly Amendment No. 833 to Assembly Bill No. 540 First Reprint Page 6
118 recommendation as to whether the requirements to issue such licenses by endorsement and
119 provisional licenses, as required by sections 39 and 40, should be continued, modified or
120 terminated.
