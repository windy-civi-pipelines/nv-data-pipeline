Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law charges the Housing Division of the Department of Business and Industry
2 with certain duties relating to low-income housing and affordable housing. (Chapter 319 of
3 NRS) Section 9 of this bill creates the Nevada Attainable Housing Account in the State
4 General Fund, to be administered by the Division. Section 10 of this bill authorizes the
5 Division to distribute money in the Account to eligible entities for certain expenditures
6 relating to attainable housing. Section 50 of this bill appropriates $133,000,000 to the
7 Account.
8 Section 11 of this bill requires the Administrator of the Division to adopt an annual
9 allocation plan for disbursing money from the Account. Section 50.5 of this bill requires the
10 Division to include in the initial allocation plan adopted pursuant to section 11 certain
11 allocations of money from the Account for certain purposes authorized by section 10.
12 Section 22 of this bill exempts the Division from complying with the provisions of the
13 Administrative Procedures Act in adopting the annual allocation plan.
14 Section 12 of this bill requires that an eligible entity provide or secure matching funds in
15 an amount not less than the amount of the money awarded to the eligible entity from the
16 Account.
17 Section 14.5 of this bill requires the Division to submit a report of certain information to
18 the Interim Finance Committee at the last meeting of each fiscal year and the last meeting of
19 each calendar year relating to the Account.

21 oversight and strategic guidance for the administration and allocation of the Account; and (2)
22 sets forth the membership of the Council.
23 Section 16 of this bill requires the Division to establish procedures to ensure that any
24 member of the Council discloses any direct or indirect financial interest in any attainable
25 housing project or eligible entity that applies for or receives funding from the Account.

Senate Amendment No. 991 to Assembly Bill No. 540 Second Reprint Page 5
26 Section 17 of this bill requires the Council to: (1) review and comment on certain housing
27 reports; and (2) provide recommendations to the Division regarding the allocation and use of
28 money from the Account.
29 Existing law authorizes, with certain exceptions, the Division to: (1) establish certain
30 funds or accounts; and (2) invest or deposit its money, but does not require the Division to
31 keep any of its money in the State Treasury. (NRS 319.170) Section 18 of this bill creates an
32 additional exception to these provisions for the Account created by section 9.
33 Sections 2-8 of this bill define certain terms relating to the provisions of sections 2-17.
34 Section 18.17 of this bill provides, with certain exceptions, that: (1) the total
35 aggregate number of units of residential real property in this State that may be
36 purchased in any 1 calendar year by corporations, limited-liability companies and any
37 affiliates of such entities must not exceed 2,000 units; and (2) a corporation, limited-
38 liability company or affiliate of such an entity is prohibited from purchasing any unit of
39 residential real property in this State if, as a result of the purchase, the total aggregate
40 number of units of residential real property purchased in this State during the current
41 calendar year by any corporations, limited-liability companies and affiliates of such
42 entities would exceed 2,000 units.
43 Section 18.17 also requires the Securities Division of the Office of the Secretary of
44 State to create and maintain a registry of corporations, limited-liability companies and
45 any affiliates of such entities that purchase or own residential real property in this State.
46 Section 18.17 requires, with certain exceptions, a corporation, limited-liability company
47 or any affiliate of such an entity to register with the Securities Division each time before
48 the entity purchases any unit of residential real property in this State. Section 18.17
49 exempts from that requirement a corporation, limited-liability company or affiliate of
50 such an entity that owns less than 15 units of residential real property in this State.
51 Section 18.17: (1) authorizes the Secretary of State to charge a fee to each such
52 corporation, limited-liability company or affiliate of such an entity; and (2) requires the
53 Secretary of State to adopt regulations necessary to carry out the provisions of section
54 18.17. For the purposes of section 18.17, the term “corporation” does not include a
55 family trust company or a housing authority. Section 18.19 of this bill authorizes the
56 Attorney General, upon the request of the Secretary of State, to bring an action against
57 an entity that violates or proposes to violate the provisions of section 18.17 to obtain an
58 injunction or other equitable relief appropriate to ensure compliance with or enforce the
59 provisions of section 18.17.
60 Existing law sets forth the requirements for recording certain documents that relate
61 to real property. (NRS 111.312) Section 18.23 of this bill prohibits a county recorder
62 from filing a deed for a unit of residential real property purchased by a corporation,
63 limited-liability company or affiliate of such an entity unless the entity submits to the
64 county recorder for recording, concurrently with the deed to be recorded, a copy of the
65 certificate of registration for that purchase issued by the Secretary of State pursuant to
66 section 18.17. Section 18.23 requires a county recorder to provide to the Secretary of
67 State upon request certain information relating to the requirement imposed by section
68 18.17.
69 Section 18.21 of this bill requires the Secretary of State to adopt regulations
70 establishing requirements for the form and contents of any instrument that creates a life
71 estate. Section 18.23 prohibits a county recorder from recording a document that is such
72 an instrument unless the document complies with those requirements
73 Sections 19 and 20 of this bill authorize the Division to establish a program for the
74 reporting of rental payments to a credit reporting agency.
75 Existing law sets forth certain procedures for a board of county commissioners or
76 governing body of a city to sell or lease real property. (NRS 244.281, 268.061) Sections 23
77 and 26 of this bill require, before approving the sale or lease of real property for the
78 development of attainable housing, in addition to other procedures, the board or governing
79 body to evaluate the capacity and commitment of the developer to provide long-term benefits
80 to the county in a manner that promotes transparency and does not interfere with equitable
81 competition. Sections 23 and 26 also require the developer to submit certain information to
82 the board or governing body.
83 Existing law authorizes a nonprofit organization to submit to a board of county
84 commissioners or governing body of a city an application for conveyance of certain property

Senate Amendment No. 991 to Assembly Bill No. 540 Second Reprint Page 6
85 that is owned by the county or city, as applicable. The board or governing body may approve
86 such an application if the nonprofit organization demonstrates that the organization or its
87 assignee will use the property to develop affordable housing. (NRS 244.287, 268.058)
88 Sections 24 and 25 of this bill: (1) instead authorize the board or governing body to approve
89 such an application for attainable housing; and (2) require an application to include certain
90 information.
91 Existing law establishes three tiers of affordable housing for various purposes in existing
92 law and defines “affordable housing” as housing that falls within any of the three tiers. (NRS
93 232.860, 244.189, 244.287, 268.058, 268.190, 278.0105, 279.385, 279A.020, 279B.020,
94 315.9625, 319.042) Section 33 of this bill revises the term “affordable housing” to be
95 “attainable housing.”
96 Under existing law, the tiers are based on both household income and the costs of housing
97 as a percentage of that income. With respect to household income: (1) “tier one affordable
98 housing” is housing for a household which has a total monthly gross income that is equal to
99 not more than 60 percent of the median monthly gross household income for the county in
100 which the housing is located, which is commonly known as the area median household
101 income; (2) “tier two affordable housing” is housing for a household which has a total
102 monthly gross income that is equal to more than 60 percent but not more than 80 percent of
103 the area median household income; and (3) “tier three affordable housing” is housing for a
104 household which has a total monthly gross income that is equal to more than 80 percent but
105 not more than 120 percent of the area median household income. In addition, with respect to
106 the costs of housing, affordable housing under existing law is housing that costs not more than
107 30 percent of the total monthly gross household income of the household with an income at
108 the maximum percentage of the area median household income for the tier. (NRS 278.01902,
109 278.01904, 278,01906) Section 29 of this bill creates a new tier of affordable housing, to be
110 known as “tier four affordable housing,” that addresses housing for a household that has a
111 total monthly gross income that is equal to not more than 120 percent but not more than 150
112 percent of the area median household income.
113 Existing law sets forth an approval process for the subdivision of land that requires a
114 subdivider to submit a tentative map to the planning commission or governing body of a
115 county or city, as applicable. (NRS 278.330) Existing law also requires the tentative map to be
116 forwarded to certain state agencies and local governments for review. (NRS 278.335) Section
117 31 of this bill requires each reviewing agency to adopt a process for the expedited review of
118 and comment on a tentative map that includes attainable housing.
119 Existing law requires the governing body of each county and city, on or before July 1,
120 2024, to enact by ordinance an expedited process for the consideration and approval of
121 projects for affordable housing. (Section 12 of Assembly Bill No. 213, chapter 200, Statutes
122 of Nevada 2023, at p. 1171) Section 30 of this bill requires the governing body of each county
123 and the governing body of each city to adopt an expedited process for the consideration and
124 approval of projects for attainable housing.
125 Section 32 of this bill applies the definitions of certain terms relating to planning and
126 zoning to sections 29-31.
127 Sections 34-36 of this bill, respectively, revise the definitions of “tier one affordable
128 housing,” “tier three affordable housing” and “tier two affordable housing” to provide that the
129 costs of such housing may be offset by certain energy cost savings.
130 Existing law requires the governing body of certain cities and counties to adopt at least 6
131 of 12 specified measures in implementing a plan for maintaining and developing affordable
132 housing, which may include a measure to reduce or subsidize impact fees, fees for the
133 issuance of building permits and fees imposed for the purpose for which an enterprise fund
134 was created. (NRS 278.235) Section 37 of this bill authorizes that the governing body of such
135 a county or city include a measure to also reimburse such fees.
136 Existing law sets forth the requirements for obtaining a contractor’s license from the State
137 Contractors’ Board. (Chapter 624 of NRS) Section 39 of this bill requires, under certain
138 circumstances, the Board to issue a contractor’s license by endorsement to certain applicants
139 who will perform work on an attainable housing project in certain rural areas.
140 Section 40 of this bill provides that, if the Director of the Department of Business and
141 Industry determines that there is a shortage of skilled labor or licensed contractors in a rural
142 area that is adversely impacting the availability of attainable housing for essential workers
143 who are employed in the area, the Director may issue a declaration of such shortage for not

Senate Amendment No. 991 to Assembly Bill No. 540 Second Reprint Page 7
144 more than 3 years. Upon such a declaration, the Board is required to implement a process to
145 issue provisional contractors’ licenses to certain applicants who will perform work on an
146 attainable housing project in certain rural areas.
147 Sections 41 and 42 of this bill exempt the license by endorsement issued pursuant to
148 section 39 or a provisional license issued pursuant to section 40 from certain licensing
149 requirements and the expiration date that generally apply to contractors’ licenses. Sections 42-
150 46 of this bill exempt applicants for a new contractor’s license and existing licensed
151 contractors in rural areas from any application, license or renewal fee or certain other fees
152 relating to a contractor’s license under circumstances where the Director of the Department of
153 Business and Industry has issued a declaration of shortage pursuant to section 40.
154 Sections 48 and 49 of this bill require the Board to: (1) adopt regulations to carry out the
155 provisions of sections 39 and 40, respectively, before January 1, 2026; and (2) submit a report
156 to the Governor and Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau that includes a
157 recommendation as to whether the requirements to issue such licenses by endorsement and
158 provisional licenses, as required by sections 39 and 40, should be continued, modified or
159 terminated.
160 Existing law contains the Windsor Park Environmental Justice Act, which
161 establishes a program for the relocation of persons residing in the Windsor Park
162 neighborhood of the City of North Las Vegas whose residences have been damaged by
163 the sinking of the ground beneath the residences. (Chapter 531, Statutes of Nevada 2023,
164 at page 3538) Under the Act, the Housing Division of the Department of Business and
165 Industry is required to establish and administer a program by which the owner of a
166 single-family residence in the Windsor Park neighborhood who owns the residence on
167 July 1, 2023, may exchange the residence in the Windsor Park neighborhood for a new
168 residence constructed in accordance with the Act. (Section 9 of chapter 531, Statutes of
169 Nevada 2023, at page 3540) Sections 46.12-46.18 of this bill makes revisions to the Act.
170 Section 46.12 clarifies the boundaries of the Windsor Park neighborhood for the
171 purposes of determining the owners of single-family residences or vacant lots who are
172 eligible to participate in the program.
173 Section 46.14: (1) requires that to be eligible to participate in the program, an owner
174 of a single-family residence or vacant lot in the Windsor
175 Park neighborhood must have owned that single-family residence or lot on December 31,
176 2023, rather than July 1, 2023; (2) authorizes a person who is the owner of a vacant lot in
177 the Windsor Park neighborhood and who was the owner, or is the descendant of the
178 former owner, of a single-family residence on that vacant lot in the Windsor Park
179 neighborhood to participate in the program by exchanging the vacant lot for another
180 vacant lot in an area as near as reasonably practicable to the Windsor Park
181 neighborhood; (3) authorizes a person who resides in the Windsor Park neighborhood to
182 establish that he or she is the owner of a single-family residence or a vacant lot in the
183 Windsor Park neighborhood and, thus, eligible to participate in the program, by
184 executing an affidavit, under penalty of perjury, and presenting certain other
185 documentation to establish inheritance of the property; (4) provides that until July 1,
186 2057, a single-family residence acquired pursuant to the Act is entitled to an abatement
187 of a certain amount of property taxes levied on the single-family residence; (5) provides
188 an exemption from taxes on the transfer of real property for certain transfers of a single-
189 family residence pursuant to the Act; (6) requires the Housing Division to record a
190 certificate creating a lien on the single-family residence acquired pursuant to the Act to
191 secure repayment of the amount of assistance provided by the Housing Division to pay
192 off any existing mortgage on the single-family residence in the Windsor Park
193 neighborhood if the new residence is sold within 5 years after recording of the
194 certificate; (7) limits the amount of assistance provided to pay off a mortgage on a single-
195 family residence in the Windsor Park neighborhood to the pay off amount on May 25,
196 2025; and (8) requires the entity selected to develop and construct a single-family
197 residence pursuant to the Act to be engaged to perform certain additional work related
198 to the project, without formal bidding under existing state law, including, without
199 limitation, demolishing the homes in the Windsor Park neighborhood for the purposes of
200 creating the park required under the Act.
201 Section 46.16: (1) requires that in addition to transferring the proceeds of certain
202 bonds to the Housing Division, the City is required to transfer the interest on those

Senate Amendment No. 991 to Assembly Bill No. 540 Second Reprint Page 8
203 proceeds to the Housing Division for the purposes of the program; and (2) removes the
204 requirement for the Housing Division to pay moving expenses and restitution to owners
205 of single-family residences in the Windsor Park neighborhood from certain Community
206 Development Block Grant funds transferred to the Housing Division and, instead,
207 authorizes those funds to be used by the Housing Division to pay relocation expenses for
208 certain owners and tenants.
209 Section 46.18 of this bill provides that money appropriated from the State General
210 Fund for the purposes of the Windsor Park Environmental Justice Act reverts at the end
211 of the 2025-2027 biennium rather than at the end of the 2023-2025 biennium.
212 Section 46.21 of this bill appropriates $26,000,000 from the State General Fund to
213 the Housing Division for the purposes of the Windsor Park Environmental Justice Act.
