4 Account in the State General Fund, to be administered by the Division. Section 10
5 of this bill authorizes the Division to distribute money in the Account to eligible

7 bill appropriates $150,000,000 to the Account.
8 Section 11 of this bill requires the Administrator of the Division to adopt an
9 annual allocation plan for disbursing money from the Account. Section 50.5 of this
10 bill requires the Division to include in the initial allocation plan adopted pursuant to
11 section 11 certain allocations of money from the Account for certain purposes
12 authorized by section 10.
13 Section 22 of this bill exempts the Division from complying with the
14 provisions of the Administrative Procedures Act in adopting the annual allocation
15 plan.
16 Section 12 of this bill requires that an eligible entity provide or secure
17 matching funds in an amount not less than the amount of the money awarded to the
18 eligible entity from the Account.
19 Section 14.5 of this bill requires the Division to submit a report of certain
20 information to the Interim Finance Committee at the last meeting of each fiscal year
21 and the last meeting of each calendar year relating to the Account.
22 Section 15 of this bill: (1) creates the Nevada Attainable Housing Council to
23 provide oversight and strategic guidance for the administration and allocation of the
24 Account; and (2) sets forth the membership of the Council.
25 Section 16 of this bill requires the Division to establish procedures to ensure
26 that any member of the Council discloses any direct or indirect financial interest in
27 any attainable housing project or eligible entity that applies for or receives funding
28 from the Account.
29 Section 17 of this bill requires the Council to: (1) review and comment on
30 certain housing reports; and (2) provide recommendations to the Division regarding
31 the allocation and use of money from the Account.
32 Existing law authorizes, with certain exceptions, the Division to: (1) establish
33 certain funds or accounts; and (2) invest or deposit its money, but does not require
34 the Division to keep any of its money in the State Treasury. (NRS 319.170) Section
35 18 of this bill creates an additional exception to these provisions for the Account
36 created by section 9.
37 Sections 2-8 of this bill define certain terms relating to the provisions of

44 property for the development of attainable housing, in addition to other procedures,
45 the board or governing body to evaluate the capacity and commitment of the
46 developer to provide long-term benefits to the county in a manner that promotes
47 transparency and does not interfere with equitable competition. Sections 23 and 26
48 also require the developer to submit certain information to the board or governing
49 body.
50 Existing law authorizes a nonprofit organization to submit to a board of county
51 commissioners or governing body of a city an application for conveyance of certain
52 property that is owned by the county. The board or governing body may approve
53 such an application if the nonprofit organization demonstrates that the organization
54 or its assignee will use the property to develop affordable housing. (NRS 244.287,
55 268.058) Sections 24 and 25 of this bill: (1) instead authorize the board or
56 governing body to approve such an application for attainable housing; and (2)
57 require an application to include certain information.
58 Existing law establishes three tiers of affordable housing for various purposes
59 in existing law and defines “affordable housing” as housing that falls within any of
60 the three tiers. (NRS 232.860, 244.189, 244.287, 268.058, 268.190, 278.0105,
61 279.385, 279A.020, 279B.020, 315.9625, 319.042) Section 33 of this bill revises
62 the term “affordable housing” to be “attainable housing.”
63 Under existing law, the tiers are based on both household income and the costs
64 of housing as a percentage of that income. With respect to household income: (1)
65 “tier one affordable housing” is housing for a household which has a total monthly
66 gross income that is equal to not more than 60 percent of the median monthly gross
67 household income for the county in which the housing is located, which is
68 commonly known as the area median household income; (2) “tier two affordable
69 housing” is housing for a household which has a total monthly gross income that is
70 equal to more than 60 percent but not more than 80 percent of the area median
71 household income; and (3) “tier three affordable housing” is housing for a
72 household which has a total monthly gross income that is equal to more than 80
73 percent but not more than 120 percent of the area median household income. In
74 addition, with respect to the costs of housing, affordable housing under existing law
75 is housing that costs not more than 30 percent of the total monthly gross household
76 income of the household with an income at the maximum percentage of the area
77 median household income for the tier. (NRS 278.01902, 278.01904, 278,01906)
78 Section 29 of this bill creates a new tier of affordable housing, to be known as “tier
79 four affordable housing,” that addresses housing for a household that has a total
80 monthly gross income that is equal to not more than 120 percent but not more than
81 150 percent of the area median household income.
82 Existing law sets forth an approval process for the subdivision of land that
83 requires a subdivider to submit a tentative map to the planning commission or
84 governing body of a county or city, as applicable. (NRS 278.330) Existing law also
85 requires the tentative map to be forwarded to certain state agencies and local
86 governments for review. (NRS 278.335) Section 31 of this bill requires each
87 reviewing agency to adopt a process for the expedited review of and comment on a
88 tentative map that includes attainable housing.
89 Existing law requires the governing body of each county and city, on or before
90 July 1, 2024, to enact by ordinance an expedited process for the consideration and
91 approval of projects for affordable housing. (Section 12 of Assembly Bill No. 213,
92 chapter 200, Statutes of Nevada 2023, at p. 1171) Section 30 of this bill requires
93 the governing body of each county and the governing body of each city to adopt an
94 expedited process for the consideration and approval of projects for attainable
95 housing.
96 Section 32 of this bill applies the definitions of certain terms relating to
97 planning and zoning to sections 29-31.

*AB540_R1*

– 4 –
98 Sections 34-36 of this bill, respectively, revise the definitions of “tier one
99 affordable housing,” “tier three affordable housing” and “tier two affordable
100 housing” to provide that the costs of such housing may be offset by certain energy
101 cost savings.
102 Existing law requires the governing body of certain cities and counties to adopt
103 at least 6 of 12 specified measures in implementing a plan for maintaining and
104 developing affordable housing, which may include a measure to reduce or subsidize
105 impact fees, fees for the issuance of building permits and fees imposed for the
106 purpose for which an enterprise fund was created. (NRS 278.235) Section 37 of
107 this bill authorizes that the governing body of such a county or city include a
108 measure to also reimburse such fees.
109 Existing law sets forth the requirements for obtaining a contractor’s license
110 from the State Contractors’ Board. (Chapter 624 of NRS) Section 39 of this bill
111 requires, under certain circumstances, the Board to issue a contractor’s license by
112 endorsement to certain applicants who will perform work on an attainable housing
113 project in certain rural areas.
114 Section 40 of this bill provides that, if the Director of the Department of
115 Business and Industry determines that there is a shortage of skilled labor or licensed
116 contractors in a rural area that is adversely impacting the availability of attainable
117 housing for essential workers who are employed in the area, the Director may issue
118 a declaration of such shortage for not more than 3 years. Upon such a declaration,
119 the Board is required to implement a process to issue provisional contractors’
120 licenses to certain applicants who will perform work on an attainable housing
121 project in certain rural areas.
122 Sections 41 and 42 of this bill exempt the license by endorsement issued
123 pursuant to section 39 or a provisional license issued pursuant to section 40 from
124 certain licensing requirements and the expiration date that generally apply to
125 contractors’ licenses. Sections 42-46 of this bill exempt applicants for a new
126 contractor’s license and existing licensed contractors in rural areas from any
127 application, license or renewal fee or certain other fees relating to a contractor’s
128 license under circumstances where the Director of the Department of Business and
129 Industry has issued a declaration of shortage pursuant to section 40.
130 Sections 48 and 49 of this bill require the Board to: (1) adopt regulations to
131 carry out the provisions of sections 39 and 40 before January 1, 2026; and (2)
132 submit a report to the Governor and Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau that
133 includes a recommendation as to whether the requirements to issue such licenses by
134 endorsement and provisional licenses, as required by sections 39 and 40, should be
135 continued, modified or terminated.
