Senate Bill No. 419–Committee on Finance
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to state financial administration; authorizing the
Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau to enter into any
contracts necessary to assist the Economic Forum and the
Technical Advisory Committee on Future State Revenues in
carrying out their duties; revising the date by which certain
reports of the Economic Forum are required to be prepared
and presented; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Under existing law, the Governor is required, on or before July 1 of each even-
numbered year, to impanel an Economic Forum, which consists of persons who
have the expertise necessary for economic forecasting and are appointed by the
Governor. (NRS 353.226) Existing law requires the Economic Forum to make
projections for economic indicators and provide an accurate estimate of the revenue
that will be collected by the State for general, unrestricted uses during the next
biennium and report such projections and estimates to the Governor and the
Legislature. (NRS 353.228) Existing law also requires that all projections of
revenue and any other information concerning future state revenue contained in the
biennial budget proposed to the Legislature be based upon the projections and
estimates prepared by the Economic Forum. (NRS 353.230, 353.246) Existing law
creates the Technical Advisory Committee on Future State Revenues and requires it
to provide all assistance requested by the Economic Forum. (NRS 353.229) Under
existing law, the Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau and the Chief of the
Budget Division of the Office of Finance are required to jointly provide the
Economic Forum and the Technical Advisory Committee with meeting rooms,
staff, data processing services and clerical assistance. (NRS 353.227) Sections 1
and 3 of this bill: (1) remove data processing services from the list of jointly
provided items; and (2) authorize the Director to enter into any contracts necessary
to assist the Economic Forum and the Technical Advisory Committee in carrying
out their duties, including contracts for revenue forecasting and data processing
services.
Existing law requires the Economic Forum, on or before December 3 of each
even-numbered year, to prepare a written report of its projections of economic
indicators and estimate of future state revenue and present the report to the
Governor and the Legislature. Additionally, existing law requires the Economic
Forum, on or before May 1 of each odd-numbered year, to prepare a written report
confirming or revising those projections and that estimate and present that report to
the Governor and the Legislature. (NRS 353.228) Section 2 of this bill moves the
date by which the latter report is required to be prepared and presented from May 1
of each odd-numbered year to April 1 of each odd-numbered year.
