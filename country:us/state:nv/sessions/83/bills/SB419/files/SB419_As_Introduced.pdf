3 have the expertise necessary for economic forecasting and are appointed by the
4 Governor. (NRS 353.226) Existing law requires the Economic Forum to make
5 projections for economic indicators and provide an accurate estimate of the revenue
6 that will be collected by the State for general, unrestricted uses during the next
7 biennium and report such projections and estimates to the Governor and the
8 Legislature. (NRS 353.228) Existing law also requires that all projections of
9 revenue and any other information concerning future state revenue contained in the
10 biennial budget proposed to the Legislature be based upon the projections and
11 estimates prepared by the Economic Forum. (NRS 353.230, 353.246) Existing law
12 creates the Technical Advisory Committee on Future State Revenues and requires it
13 to provide all assistance requested by the Economic Forum. (NRS 353.229) Under
14 existing law, the Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau and the Chief of the
15 Budget Division of the Office of Finance are required to jointly provide the
16 Economic Forum and the Technical Advisory Committee with meeting rooms,
17 staff, data processing services and clerical assistance. (NRS 353.227) Sections 1
18 and 3 of this bill: (1) remove data processing services from the list of jointly
19 provided items; and (2) authorize the Director to enter into any contracts necessary
20 to assist the Economic Forum and the Technical Advisory Committee in carrying

23 Existing law requires the Economic Forum, on or before December 3 of each
24 even-numbered year, to prepare a written report of its projections of economic
25 indicators and estimate of future state revenue and present the report to the
26 Governor and the Legislature. Additionally, existing law requires the Economic
27 Forum, on or before May 1 of each odd-numbered year, to prepare a written report
28 confirming or revising those projections and that estimate and present that report to
29 the Governor and the Legislature. (NRS 353.228) Section 2 of this bill moves the

31 of each odd-numbered year to April 1 of each odd-numbered year.
