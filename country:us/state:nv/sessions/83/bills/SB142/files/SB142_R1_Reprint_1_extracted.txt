~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to civil actions; requiring the Department of
Taxation to adjust monetary amounts set forth in
provisions governing property exempt from execution
every 3 years; revising the amount of disposable earnings
of a judgment debtor that is exempt from execution under
certain circumstances; revising the definition of
“earnings” for the purposes of provisions governing that
exemption; revising the amount of money held in a
personal bank account of a judgment debtor that is
exempt from execution under certain circumstances; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law allows a judgment creditor to obtain a writ of execution,
2 attachment or garnishment to levy on the property of a judgment debtor or
3 defendant in certain circumstances. (Chapters 21 and 31 of NRS) With certain
4 exceptions, existing law exempts certain property from execution, thereby
5 prohibiting such property from being the subject of such a writ. (NRS 21.090-
6 21.105) Among the property exempt from execution, certain property is exempt
7 only up to a specified amount. For example, payments received by a judgment
8 debtor or by a person upon whom the judgment debtor is dependent as
9 compensation for personal injury that are not compensation for pain and suffering
10 or actual pecuniary loss are exempt from execution to the extent that such payments
11 do not exceed $16,150. (NRS 21.090) Additionally, under existing law, with certain
12 exceptions, $605,000 in equity in property designated as a homestead, including
13 certain payments made to a defendant or spouse in that amount upon the sale of
14 homestead property under certain circumstances, is protected from a forced sale
15 upon execution or any final process from any court. (NRS 21.090, 115.010,
16 115.050, 115.055) Sections 1, 4, 5 and 8-11 of this bill require the monetary
17 amounts set forth in the provisions of existing law governing property exempt from
-
*SB142_R1*
– 2 –
18 execution to be adjusted on April 1, 2026, and every 3 years thereafter in amount
19 equal to the percentage of increase or decrease in the Consumer Price Index for All
20 Urban Consumers, West Region (All Items), as published by the United States
21 Department of Labor for the period beginning on January 1 and ending on
22 December 31 of the year immediately preceding the date of adjustment. Section 1
23 requires the Department of Taxation, on or before February 1 of each year in which
24 an adjustment is required, to determine the amount of the adjustment, establish the
25 adjusted amounts to take effect on April 1 of that year and post the adjusted
26 amounts on the Internet website of the Department.
27 Under existing law, the greater of the following amounts are exempt from
28 execution: (1) 82 percent of a judgment debtor’s disposable earnings for any
29 workweek if his or her gross weekly salary or wage on the date the most recent writ
30 of garnishment was issued was $770 or less; (2) 75 percent of a judgment debtor’s
31 disposable earnings for any workweek if his or her gross weekly salary or wage on
32 the date the most recent writ of garnishment was issued exceeded $770; or (3) 50
33 times the federal minimum hourly wage. (NRS 21.090, 31.295) Sections 4 and 8
34 revise that exemption to instead exempt from execution $850 of the disposable
35 earnings of a judgment debtor during a workweek and either 90 percent of the
36 disposable earnings of the judgment debtor during that week that exceed $850, if
37 the disposable earnings of the judgment debtor during that week are $1,200 or less,
38 or 85 percent of the disposable earnings of the judgment debtor during that week
39 that exceed $850, if the disposable earnings of the judgment debtor during that
40 week are more than $1,200. Because sections 4 and 8 eliminate the use of a
41 judgment debtor’s gross weekly salary or wage in determining the amount of the
42 exception, section 12 of this bill repeals provisions setting forth the manner in
43 which gross weekly salary or wage must be determined.
44 For the purposes of provisions governing the exemption from execution for the
45 disposable earnings of a judgment debtor, existing law defines: (1) “earnings” to
46 mean compensation paid or payable for personal services performed by a judgment
47 debtor in the regular course of business; and (2) “disposable earnings” to mean that
48 part of the earnings of a judgment debtor remaining after the deduction from those
49 earnings of any amounts required by law to be withheld. (NRS 21.090, 31.295)
50 Sections 4 and 8 revise the definition of the term “earnings” to specify that the
51 term includes compensation paid or payable for personal services performed by a
52 judgment debtor in the regular course of business, regardless of whether the
53 judgment debtor performed such services as an employee or independent
54 contractor.
55 Existing law exempts from execution: (1) $2,000 in a personal bank account if,
56 within the 45 days immediately preceding the date on which a writ of execution or
57 garnishment is levied on the account, money which is reasonably identifiable as
58 exempt from execution has been electronically deposited into the account; or (2) if
59 no such money has been deposited, $400. (NRS 21.105) Section 5 revises those
60 exemptions to eliminate the exemption concerning money deposited within the 45
61 days immediately preceding the date on which the writ is levied and, instead,
62 exempts $5,000 in a personal bank account, regardless of whether any money
63 reasonably identifiable as exempt was deposited in the account before the writ is
64 levied.
65 Sections 2, 3, 6 and 7 of this bill revise the form of a writ of execution and of
66 certain notices and interrogatories required to be served in connection with a writ of
67 execution, attachment or garnishment, to reflect the changes set forth in sections 1,
68 4, 5 and 8-11.

26 exemption must be served upon the sheriff, the garnishee and
27 the judgment creditor within 10 days after the notice of
28 execution or garnishment is served on you by mail pursuant
29 to NRS 21.076 which identifies the specific property that is
30 being levied on. The property must be released by the
31 garnishee or the sheriff within 9 judicial days after you serve
32 the claim of exemption upon the sheriff, garnishee and
33 judgment creditor, unless the sheriff or garnishee receives a
34 copy of an objection to the claim of exemption and a notice
35 for a hearing to determine the issue of exemption. If this
36 happens, a hearing will be held to determine whether the
37 property or money is exempt. The objection to the claim of
38 exemption and notice for the hearing to determine the issue of
39 exemption must be filed within 8 judicial days after the claim
40 of exemption is served on the judgment creditor by mail or in
41 person and served on the judgment debtor, the sheriff and any
42 garnishee not less than 5 judicial days before the date set for
43 the hearing. The hearing to determine whether the property or
44 money is exempt must be held within 7 judicial days after the

1 PROCEDURE FOR CLAIMING EXEMPT PROPERTY
2
3 If you believe that the money or property taken from you
4 is exempt or necessary for the support of you or your family,
5 you must file with the clerk of the court on a form provided
6 by the clerk an executed claim of exemption. A copy of the
7 claim of exemption must be served upon the sheriff, the
8 garnishee and the judgment creditor within 10 days after
9 the notice of execution or garnishment is served on you by
10 mail pursuant to NRS 21.076 which identifies the specific
11 property that is being levied on. The property must be
12 released by the garnishee or the sheriff within 9 judicial days
13 after you serve the claim of exemption upon the sheriff,
14 garnishee and judgment creditor, unless the sheriff or
15 garnishee receives a copy of an objection to the claim of
16 exemption and a notice for a hearing to determine the issue of
17 exemption. If this happens, a hearing will be held to
18 determine whether the property or money is exempt. The
19 objection to the claim of exemption and notice for the hearing
20 to determine the issue of exemption must be filed within 8
21 judicial days after the claim of exemption is served on the
22 judgment creditor by mail or in person and served on the
23 judgment debtor, the sheriff and any garnishee not less than 5
24 judicial days before the date set for the hearing. The hearing
25 must be held within 7 judicial days after the objection to the
26 claim of exemption and notice for a hearing is filed. You may
27 be able to have your property released more quickly if you
28 mail to the judgment creditor or the attorney of the judgment
29 creditor written proof that the property is exempt. Such proof
30 may include, without limitation, a letter from the government,
31 an annual statement from a pension fund, receipts for
32 payment, copies of checks, records from financial institutions
33 or any other document which demonstrates that the money in
34 your account is exempt.
35
36 IF YOU DO NOT FILE THE EXECUTED CLAIM OF
37 EXEMPTION WITHIN THE TIME SPECIFIED, YOUR
38 PROPERTY MAY BE SOLD AND THE MONEY GIVEN
39 TO THE JUDGMENT CREDITOR, EVEN IF THE
40 PROPERTY OR MONEY IS EXEMPT.
41
42 If you received this notice with a notice of a hearing for
43 attachment and you believe that the money or property which
44 would be taken from you by a writ of attachment is exempt or
45 necessary for the support of you or your family, you are
-
*SB142_R1*
– 23 –
1 entitled to describe to the court at the hearing why you
2 believe your property is exempt. You may also file a motion
3 with the court for a discharge of the writ of attachment. You
4 may make that motion any time before trial. A hearing will be
5 held on that motion.
6
7 IF YOU DO NOT FILE THE MOTION BEFORE THE
8 TRIAL, YOUR PROPERTY MAY BE SOLD AND
9 THE MONEY GIVEN TO THE PLAINTIFF, EVEN IF THE
10 PROPERTY OR MONEY IS EXEMPT OR NECESSARY
11 FOR THE SUPPORT OF YOU OR YOUR FAMILY.

38 current calendar year as of the date the most recent writ of
39 garnishment was issued by the total number of weeks the
40 employee has worked in the current calendar year.
41 2. If the most recent writ of garnishment was issued at
42 the beginning of the current calendar year before the
43 employee received any earnings in the current calendar year,
44 but the employee received earnings in the previous calendar
45 year, by dividing the employee’s gross earnings for the
-
*SB142_R1*
– 25 –
1 previous calendar year by the total number of weeks the
2 employee worked in the previous calendar year.
3 3. If the employee has not been employed long enough
4 to have been paid as of the date the most recent writ of
5 garnishment was issued, or if the provisions of number 1 or 2
6 above do not otherwise apply, the gross weekly salary or
7 wage of the employee is the anticipated gross weekly
8 earnings of the employee as determined by his or her
9 employer.
10 For the purpose of determining the total number of weeks
11 the employee has worked in the current calendar year or the
12 total number of weeks the employee worked in the previous
13 calendar year, as applicable, if the total number of weeks is
14 not exact, the number must be rounded down if the number of
15 days the employee was on the payroll of his or her employer
16 in excess of a whole week is 3 days or less, and rounded up if
17 the number of days the employee was on the payroll of his or

6 the amount of equity held by the claimant in the property exceeds, to
7 the best of the creditor’s information and belief, the sum of
8 $605,000, as adjusted pursuant to section 1 of this act, the judge
9 shall, upon notice to the debtor, appoint three disinterested and
10 competent persons as appraisers to estimate and report as to the
11 amount of equity held by the claimant in the property and, if the
12 amount of equity exceeds the sum of $605,000, as adjusted
13 pursuant to section 1 of this act, determine whether the property

15 exemption without material injury.
16 2. If it appears, upon the report, to the satisfaction of the judge
17 that the property can be thus divided, the judge shall order the
18 excess to be sold under execution. If it appears that the property
19 cannot be thus divided, and the amount of equity held by the
20 claimant in the property exceeds the exemption allowed by this
21 chapter, the judge shall order the entire property to be sold, and out
22 of the proceeds the sum of $605,000 , as adjusted pursuant to
23 section 1 of this act, to be paid to the defendant in execution, and
24 the excess to be applied to the satisfaction on the execution. No bid
25 under $605,000 may be received by the officer making the sale.
26 3. When the execution is against a spouse, the judge may direct
27 the $605,000 , as adjusted pursuant to section 1 of this act, to be
28 deposited in court, to be paid out only upon the joint receipt of both
29 spouses, and, except as otherwise provided in NRS 115.055, the
30 deposit possesses all the protection against legal process and
31 voluntary disposition by either spouse as did the original homestead.
32 4. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 115.055, if the sum of
33 $605,000 , as adjusted pursuant to section 1 of this act, is paid to
34 the defendant in execution pursuant to subsection 2 or to a spouse
35 pursuant to subsection 3, such sum of $605,000 , as adjusted
36 pursuant to section 1 of this act, possesses all the protection against
37 legal process and voluntary disposition by the defendant or spouse
38 as did the original homestead.
39 Sec. 11. NRS 115.055 is hereby amended to read as follows:
40 115.055 Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the
41 proceeds of $605,000 , as adjusted pursuant to section 1 of this act,
42 from the sale of a homestead pursuant to subsection 2 or 3 of NRS
43 115.050 are only exempt from execution if:

FIRST REPRINT S.B. 142
SENATE BILL NO. 142–SENATOR DOÑATE
PREFILED JANUARY 30, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Judiciary
SUMMARY—Revises provisions governing property that is exempt
from execution. (BDR 2-707)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to civil actions; requiring the Department of
Taxation to adjust monetary amounts set forth in
provisions governing property exempt from execution
every 3 years; revising the amount of disposable earnings
of a judgment debtor that is exempt from execution under
certain circumstances; revising the definition of
“earnings” for the purposes of provisions governing that
exemption; revising the amount of money held in a
personal bank account of a judgment debtor that is
exempt from execution under certain circumstances; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law allows a judgment creditor to obtain a writ of execution,
2 attachment or garnishment to levy on the property of a judgment debtor or
3 defendant in certain circumstances. (Chapters 21 and 31 of NRS) With certain
4 exceptions, existing law exempts certain property from execution, thereby
5 prohibiting such property from being the subject of such a writ. (NRS 21.090-
6 21.105) Among the property exempt from execution, certain property is exempt
7 only up to a specified amount. For example, payments received by a judgment
8 debtor or by a person upon whom the judgment debtor is dependent as
9 compensation for personal injury that are not compensation for pain and suffering
10 or actual pecuniary loss are exempt from execution to the extent that such payments
11 do not exceed $16,150. (NRS 21.090) Additionally, under existing law, with certain
12 exceptions, $605,000 in equity in property designated as a homestead, including
13 certain payments made to a defendant or spouse in that amount upon the sale of
14 homestead property under certain circumstances, is protected from a forced sale
15 upon execution or any final process from any court. (NRS 21.090, 115.010,
16 115.050, 115.055) Sections 1, 4, 5 and 8-11 of this bill require the monetary
17 amounts set forth in the provisions of existing law governing property exempt from
-
*SB142_R1*

– 2 –
18 execution to be adjusted on April 1, 2026, and every 3 years thereafter in amount
19 equal to the percentage of increase or decrease in the Consumer Price Index for All
20 Urban Consumers, West Region (All Items), as published by the United States
21 Department of Labor for the period beginning on January 1 and ending on
22 December 31 of the year immediately preceding the date of adjustment. Section 1
23 requires the Department of Taxation, on or before February 1 of each year in which
24 an adjustment is required, to determine the amount of the adjustment, establish the
25 adjusted amounts to take effect on April 1 of that year and post the adjusted
26 amounts on the Internet website of the Department.
27 Under existing law, the greater of the following amounts are exempt from
28 execution: (1) 82 percent of a judgment debtor’s disposable earnings for any
29 workweek if his or her gross weekly salary or wage on the date the most recent writ
30 of garnishment was issued was $770 or less; (2) 75 percent of a judgment debtor’s
31 disposable earnings for any workweek if his or her gross weekly salary or wage on
32 the date the most recent writ of garnishment was issued exceeded $770; or (3) 50
33 times the federal minimum hourly wage. (NRS 21.090, 31.295) Sections 4 and 8
34 revise that exemption to instead exempt from execution $850 of the disposable
35 earnings of a judgment debtor during a workweek and either 90 percent of the
36 disposable earnings of the judgment debtor during that week that exceed $850, if
37 the disposable earnings of the judgment debtor during that week are $1,200 or less,
38 or 85 percent of the disposable earnings of the judgment debtor during that week
39 that exceed $850, if the disposable earnings of the judgment debtor during that
40 week are more than $1,200. Because sections 4 and 8 eliminate the use of a
41 judgment debtor’s gross weekly salary or wage in determining the amount of the
42 exception, section 12 of this bill repeals provisions setting forth the manner in
43 which gross weekly salary or wage must be determined.
44 For the purposes of provisions governing the exemption from execution for the
45 disposable earnings of a judgment debtor, existing law defines: (1) “earnings” to
46 mean compensation paid or payable for personal services performed by a judgment
47 debtor in the regular course of business; and (2) “disposable earnings” to mean that
48 part of the earnings of a judgment debtor remaining after the deduction from those
49 earnings of any amounts required by law to be withheld. (NRS 21.090, 31.295)
50 Sections 4 and 8 revise the definition of the term “earnings” to specify that the
51 term includes compensation paid or payable for personal services performed by a
52 judgment debtor in the regular course of business, regardless of whether the
53 judgment debtor performed such services as an employee or independent
54 contractor.
55 Existing law exempts from execution: (1) $2,000 in a personal bank account if,
56 within the 45 days immediately preceding the date on which a writ of execution or
57 garnishment is levied on the account, money which is reasonably identifiable as
58 exempt from execution has been electronically deposited into the account; or (2) if
59 no such money has been deposited, $400. (NRS 21.105) Section 5 revises those
60 exemptions to eliminate the exemption concerning money deposited within the 45
61 days immediately preceding the date on which the writ is levied and, instead,
62 exempts $5,000 in a personal bank account, regardless of whether any money
63 reasonably identifiable as exempt was deposited in the account before the writ is
64 levied.
65 Sections 2, 3, 6 and 7 of this bill revise the form of a writ of execution and of
66 certain notices and interrogatories required to be served in connection with a writ of
67 execution, attachment or garnishment, to reflect the changes set forth in sections 1,
68 4, 5 and 8-11.

5 2026, and every 3 years thereafter, by a percentage equal to the
6 percentage of increase or decrease in the Consumer Price Index
7 for All Urban Consumers, West Region (All Items), as published
8 by the United States Department of Labor for the period beginning
9 on January 1 and ending on December 31 of the year immediately

43 the recovery of money owed for the support of any person.
44 [3.] 2. If a judgment debtor has more than one personal bank
45 account with the bank to which a writ is issued, the amount that is
-
*SB142_R1*

– 17 –
1 not subject to execution must not in the aggregate exceed the
2 amount specified in subsection 1 . [or 2, as applicable.
3 4.] 3. A judgment debtor may apply to a court to claim an
4 exemption for any amount subject to a writ levied on a personal
5 bank account which exceeds the amount that is not subject to
6 execution pursuant to subsection 1 . [or 2.
7 5.] 4. If money in the personal account of the judgment debtor
8 which exceeds the amount that is not subject to execution pursuant
9 to subsection 1 [or 2] includes exempt and nonexempt money, the
10 judgment debtor may claim an exemption for the exempt money in
11 the manner set forth in NRS 21.112. To determine whether such
12 money in the account is exempt, the judgment creditor must use the
13 method of accounting which applies the standard that the first
14 money deposited in the account is the first money withdrawn from
15 the account. The court may require a judgment debtor to provide
16 statements from the bank which include all deposits into and
17 withdrawals from the account for the immediately preceding 90
18 days.
19 [6.] 5. A financial institution which makes a reasonable effort
20 to determine whether money in the account of a judgment debtor is
21 subject to execution for the purposes of this section is immune from
22 civil liability for any act or omission with respect to that
23 determination . [, including, without limitation, when the financial
24 institution makes an incorrect determination after applying
25 commercially reasonable methods for determining whether money
26 in an account is exempt because the source of the money was not
27 clearly identifiable or because the financial institution inadvertently
28 misidentified the source of the money.] If a court determines that a
29 financial institution failed to identify that money in an account was
30 not subject to execution pursuant to this section, the financial
31 institution must adjust its actions with respect to a writ of execution
32 as soon as possible but may not be held liable for damages.
33 [7.] 6. Nothing in this section requires a financial institution to
34 revise its determination about whether money is exempt, except by
35 an order of a court.
36 Sec. 6. NRS 31.045 is hereby amended to read as follows:
37 31.045 1. Execution on the writ of attachment by attaching
38 property of the defendant may occur only if:
39 (a) The judgment creditor serves the defendant with notice of
40 the execution when the notice of the hearing is served pursuant to
41 NRS 31.013; or
42 (b) Pursuant to an ex parte hearing, the sheriff serves upon the
43 judgment debtor notice of the execution and a copy of the writ at the
44 same time and in the same manner as set forth in NRS 21.076.

1 PROCEDURE FOR CLAIMING EXEMPT PROPERTY
2
3 If you believe that the money or property taken from you
4 is exempt or necessary for the support of you or your family,
5 you must file with the clerk of the court on a form provided
6 by the clerk an executed claim of exemption. A copy of the
7 claim of exemption must be served upon the sheriff, the
8 garnishee and the judgment creditor within 10 days after
9 the notice of execution or garnishment is served on you by
10 mail pursuant to NRS 21.076 which identifies the specific
11 property that is being levied on. The property must be
12 released by the garnishee or the sheriff within 9 judicial days
13 after you serve the claim of exemption upon the sheriff,
14 garnishee and judgment creditor, unless the sheriff or
15 garnishee receives a copy of an objection to the claim of
16 exemption and a notice for a hearing to determine the issue of
17 exemption. If this happens, a hearing will be held to
18 determine whether the property or money is exempt. The
19 objection to the claim of exemption and notice for the hearing
20 to determine the issue of exemption must be filed within 8
21 judicial days after the claim of exemption is served on the
22 judgment creditor by mail or in person and served on the
23 judgment debtor, the sheriff and any garnishee not less than 5
24 judicial days before the date set for the hearing. The hearing
25 must be held within 7 judicial days after the objection to the
26 claim of exemption and notice for a hearing is filed. You may
27 be able to have your property released more quickly if you
28 mail to the judgment creditor or the attorney of the judgment
29 creditor written proof that the property is exempt. Such proof
30 may include, without limitation, a letter from the government,
31 an annual statement from a pension fund, receipts for
32 payment, copies of checks, records from financial institutions
33 or any other document which demonstrates that the money in
34 your account is exempt.
35
36 IF YOU DO NOT FILE THE EXECUTED CLAIM OF
37 EXEMPTION WITHIN THE TIME SPECIFIED, YOUR
38 PROPERTY MAY BE SOLD AND THE MONEY GIVEN
39 TO THE JUDGMENT CREDITOR, EVEN IF THE
40 PROPERTY OR MONEY IS EXEMPT.
41
42 If you received this notice with a notice of a hearing for
43 attachment and you believe that the money or property which
44 would be taken from you by a writ of attachment is exempt or
45 necessary for the support of you or your family, you are
-
*SB142_R1*

– 23 –
1 entitled to describe to the court at the hearing why you
2 believe your property is exempt. You may also file a motion
3 with the court for a discharge of the writ of attachment. You
4 may make that motion any time before trial. A hearing will be
5 held on that motion.
6
7 IF YOU DO NOT FILE THE MOTION BEFORE THE
8 TRIAL, YOUR PROPERTY MAY BE SOLD AND
9 THE MONEY GIVEN TO THE PLAINTIFF, EVEN IF THE
10 PROPERTY OR MONEY IS EXEMPT OR NECESSARY
11 FOR THE SUPPORT OF YOU OR YOUR FAMILY.

4 to have been paid as of the date the most recent writ of
5 garnishment was issued, or if the provisions of number 1 or 2
6 above do not otherwise apply, the gross weekly salary or

42 provided by subsections 2, 3 and 5, and NRS 115.090 and except as
43 otherwise required by federal law.
44 2. The exemption provided in subsection 1 extends only to that

– 28 –
1 not exceed $605,000 , as adjusted pursuant to section 1 of this act,
2 in value, unless allodial title has been established and not
3 relinquished, in which case the exemption provided in subsection 1
4 extends to all equity in the dwelling, its appurtenances and the land
5 on which it is located.
6 3. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 4, the exemption
7 provided in subsection 1 does not extend to process to enforce the
8 payment of obligations contracted for the purchase of the property,
9 or for improvements made thereon, including any mechanic’s lien
10 lawfully obtained, or for legal taxes, or for:
11 (a) Any mortgage or deed of trust thereon executed and given,
12 including, without limitation, any second or subsequent mortgage,
13 mortgage obtained through refinancing, line of credit taken against
14 the property and a home equity loan; or
15 (b) Any lien to which prior consent has been given through the
16 acceptance of property subject to any recorded declaration of
17 restrictions, deed restriction, restrictive covenant or equitable
18 servitude, specifically including any lien in favor of an association
19 pursuant to NRS 116.3116 or 117.070,
20  by both spouses, when that relation exists.
21 4. If allodial title has been established and not relinquished, the
22 exemption provided in subsection 1 extends to process to enforce
23 the payment of obligations contracted for the purchase of the
24 property, and for improvements made thereon, including any
25 mechanic’s lien lawfully obtained, and for legal taxes levied by a
26 state or local government, and for:
27 (a) Any mortgage or deed of trust thereon; and
28 (b) Any lien even if prior consent has been given through the
29 acceptance of property subject to any recorded declaration of
30 restrictions, deed restriction, restrictive covenant or equitable
31 servitude, specifically including any lien in favor of an association
32 pursuant to NRS 116.3116 or 117.070,
33  unless a waiver for the specific obligation to which the judgment
34 relates has been executed by all allodial titleholders of the property.
35 5. Establishment of allodial title does not exempt the property
36 from forfeiture pursuant to NRS 179.1156 to 179.121, inclusive,
37 179.1211 to 179.1235, inclusive, or 207.350 to 207.520, inclusive.
38 6. Any declaration of homestead which has been filed before
39 July 1, 2007, shall be deemed to have been amended on that date by
40 extending the homestead exemption commensurate with any
41 increase in the amount of equity held by the claimant in the property
42 selected and claimed for the exemption up to the amount permitted
43 by law on that date, but the increase does not impair the right of any
44 creditor to execute upon the property when that right existed before
45 July 1, 2007.

1 Sec. 10. NRS 115.050 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 115.050 1. Whenever execution has been issued against the
3 property of a party claiming the property as a homestead, and
4 the creditor in the judgment makes an oath before the judge of the
5 district court of the county in which the property is situated that
6 the amount of equity held by the claimant in the property exceeds, to
7 the best of the creditor’s information and belief, the sum of
8 $605,000, as adjusted pursuant to section 1 of this act, the judge
9 shall, upon notice to the debtor, appoint three disinterested and
10 competent persons as appraisers to estimate and report as to the
11 amount of equity held by the claimant in the property and, if the
12 amount of equity exceeds the sum of $605,000, as adjusted
13 pursuant to section 1 of this act, determine whether the property
14 can be divided so as to leave the property subject to the homestead
15 exemption without material injury.
16 2. If it appears, upon the report, to the satisfaction of the judge
17 that the property can be thus divided, the judge shall order the
18 excess to be sold under execution. If it appears that the property
19 cannot be thus divided, and the amount of equity held by the
20 claimant in the property exceeds the exemption allowed by this
21 chapter, the judge shall order the entire property to be sold, and out
22 of the proceeds the sum of $605,000 , as adjusted pursuant to
23 section 1 of this act, to be paid to the defendant in execution, and
24 the excess to be applied to the satisfaction on the execution. No bid
25 under $605,000 may be received by the officer making the sale.
26 3. When the execution is against a spouse, the judge may direct
27 the $605,000 , as adjusted pursuant to section 1 of this act, to be
28 deposited in court, to be paid out only upon the joint receipt of both
29 spouses, and, except as otherwise provided in NRS 115.055, the
30 deposit possesses all the protection against legal process and
31 voluntary disposition by either spouse as did the original homestead.
32 4. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 115.055, if the sum of
33 $605,000 , as adjusted pursuant to section 1 of this act, is paid to
34 the defendant in execution pursuant to subsection 2 or to a spouse
35 pursuant to subsection 3, such sum of $605,000 , as adjusted
36 pursuant to section 1 of this act, possesses all the protection against
37 legal process and voluntary disposition by the defendant or spouse
38 as did the original homestead.
39 Sec. 11. NRS 115.055 is hereby amended to read as follows:
40 115.055 Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the
41 proceeds of $605,000 , as adjusted pursuant to section 1 of this act,
42 from the sale of a homestead pursuant to subsection 2 or 3 of NRS
43 115.050 are only exempt from execution if:
44 1. Such proceeds are reinvested in another property of like kind
45 for which the declaration of a homestead will be made; and
-
*SB142_R1*

– 30 –
1 2. The other property is:
2 (a) Identified not later than 45 days after the sale of the
3 homestead; and
4 (b) Taken possession of not later than 180 days after the sale of
5 the homestead.
6 Sec. 12. NRS 21.005 and 31.2955 are hereby repealed.
TEXT OF REPEALED SECTIONS
21.005 Determination of gross weekly salary or wage of
employee for purposes of chapter.
1. For the purposes of this chapter:
(a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (b) and (c), the
gross weekly salary or wage of an employee must be determined by
dividing the employee’s gross earnings for the current calendar year
as of the date the most recent writ of garnishment was issued by the
total number of weeks the employee has worked in the current
calendar year.
(b) If the most recent writ of garnishment was issued at the
beginning of the current calendar year before an employee received
any earnings in the current calendar year, but the employee received
earnings in the previous calendar year, the gross weekly salary or
wage of the employee must be determined by dividing the
employee’s gross earnings for the previous calendar year by the
total number of weeks the employee worked in the previous
calendar year.
(c) If an employee has not been employed long enough to have
been paid as of the date the most recent writ of garnishment was
issued, or if the provisions of paragraph (a) or (b) do not otherwise
apply, the gross weekly salary or wage of the employee is the
anticipated gross weekly earnings of the employee as determined by
his or her employer.
2. For the purpose of determining the total number of weeks an
employee has worked in the current calendar year pursuant to
paragraph (a) of subsection 1 or the total number of weeks an
employee worked in the previous calendar year pursuant to
paragraph (b) of subsection 1, if the total number of weeks is not
exact, the number must be:
(a) Rounded down if the number of days the employee was on
the payroll of the employer in excess of a whole week is 3 days or
less; and
-
*SB142_R1*

– 31 –
(b) Rounded up if the number of days the employee was on the
payroll of the employer in excess of a whole week is 4 days or more.
31.2955 Garnishment of earnings: Calculations for
determining gross weekly salary or wage of employee.
1. For the purposes of NRS 31.240 to 31.460, inclusive:
(a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (b) and (c), the
gross weekly salary or wage of an employee must be determined by
dividing the employee’s gross earnings for the current calendar year
as of the date the most recent writ of garnishment was issued by the
total number of weeks the employee has worked in the current
calendar year.
(b) If the most recent writ of garnishment was issued at the
beginning of the current calendar year before an employee received
any earnings in the current calendar year, but the employee received
earnings in the previous calendar year, the gross weekly salary or
wage of the employee must be determined by dividing the
employee’s gross earnings for the previous calendar year by the
total number of weeks the employee worked in the previous
calendar year.
(c) If an employee has not been employed long enough to have
been paid as of the date the most recent writ of garnishment was
issued, or if the provisions of paragraph (a) or (b) do not otherwise
apply, the gross weekly salary or wage of the employee is the
anticipated gross weekly earnings of the employee as determined by
his or her employer.
2. For the purpose of determining the total number of weeks an
employee has worked in the current calendar year pursuant to
paragraph (a) of subsection 1 or the total number of weeks an
employee worked in the previous calendar year pursuant to
paragraph (b) of subsection 1, if the total number of weeks is not
exact, the number must be:
(a) Rounded down if the number of days the employee was on
the payroll of his or her employer in excess of a whole week is 3
days or less; and
(b) Rounded up if the number of days the employee was on the
payroll of his or her employer in excess of a whole week is 4 days or
more.
