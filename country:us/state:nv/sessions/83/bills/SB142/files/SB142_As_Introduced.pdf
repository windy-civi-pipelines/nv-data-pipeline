~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to civil actions; requiring the Department of
Business and Industry to adjust monetary amounts set
forth in provisions governing property exempt from
execution every 3 years; revising the amount of
disposable earnings of a judgment debtor that is exempt
from execution under certain circumstances; revising the
definition of “earnings” for the purposes of provisions
governing that exemption; revising the amount of money
held in a personal bank account of a judgment debtor that
is exempt from execution under certain circumstances;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law allows a judgment creditor to obtain a writ of execution,
2 attachment or garnishment to levy on the property of a judgment debtor or
3 defendant in certain circumstances. (Chapters 21 and 31 of NRS) With certain
4 exceptions, existing law exempts certain property from execution, thereby
5 prohibiting such property from being the subject of such a writ. (NRS 21.090-
6 21.105) Among the property exempt from execution, certain property is exempt
7 only up to a specified amount. For example, payments received by a judgment
8 debtor or by a person upon whom the judgment debtor is dependent as
9 compensation for personal injury that are not compensation for pain and suffering
10 or actual pecuniary loss are exempt from execution to the extent that such payments
11 do not exceed $16,150. (NRS 21.090) Additionally, under existing law, with certain
12 exceptions, $605,000 in equity in property designated as a homestead, including
13 certain payments made to a defendant or spouse in that amount upon the sale of
14 homestead property under certain circumstances, is protected from a forced sale
15 upon execution or any final process from any court. (NRS 21.090, 115.010,
16 115.050, 115.055) Sections 1, 4, 5 and 8-11 of this bill require the monetary
17 amounts set forth in the provisions of existing law governing property exempt from
-
*SB142*

– 2 –
18 execution to be adjusted on April 1, 2026, and every 3 years thereafter in amount
19 equal to the percentage of increase or decrease in the Consumer Price Index for All
20 Urban Consumers, West Region (All Items), as published by the United States
21 Department of Labor for the period beginning on January 1 and ending on
22 December 31 of the year immediately preceding the date of adjustment. Section 1
23 requires the Department of Business and Industry, on or before February 1 of each
24 year in which an adjustment is required, to determine the amount of the adjustment,
25 establish the adjusted amounts to take effect on April 1 of that year and post the
26 adjusted amounts on the Internet website of the Department.
27 Under existing law, the greater of the following amounts are exempt from
28 execution: (1) 82 percent of a judgment debtor’s disposable earnings for any
29 workweek if his or her gross weekly salary or wage on the date the most recent writ
30 of garnishment was issued was $770 or less; (2) 75 percent of a judgment debtor’s
31 disposable earnings for any workweek if his or her gross weekly salary or wage on
32 the date the most recent writ of garnishment was issued exceeded $770; or (3) 50
33 times the federal minimum hourly wage. (NRS 21.090, 31.295) Sections 4 and 8
34 revise that exemption to instead exempt from execution $850 of the disposable
35 earnings of a judgment debtor during a workweek and either 90 percent of the
36 disposable earnings of the judgment debtor during that week that exceed $850, if
37 the disposable earnings of the judgment debtor during that week are $1,200 or less,
38 or 85 percent of the disposable earnings of the judgment debtor during that week
39 that exceed $850, if the disposable earnings of the judgment debtor during that
40 week are more than $1,200. Because sections 4 and 8 eliminate the use of a
41 judgment debtor’s gross weekly salary or wage in determining the amount of the
42 exception, section 12 of this bill repeals provisions setting forth the manner in
43 which gross weekly salary or wage must be determined.
44 For the purposes of provisions governing the exemption from execution for the
45 disposable earnings of a judgment debtor, existing law defines: (1) “earnings” to
46 mean compensation paid or payable for personal services performed by a judgment
47 debtor in the regular course of business; and (2) “disposable earnings” to mean that
48 part of the earnings of a judgment debtor remaining after the deduction from those
49 earnings of any amounts required by law to be withheld. (NRS 21.090, 31.295)
50 Sections 4 and 8 revise the definition of the term “earnings” to specify that the
51 term includes compensation paid or payable for personal services performed by a
52 judgment debtor in the regular course of business, regardless of whether the
53 judgment debtor performed such services as an employee or independent
54 contractor.
55 Existing law exempts from execution: (1) $2,000 in a personal bank account if,
56 within the 45 days immediately preceding the date on which a writ of execution or
57 garnishment is levied on the account, money which is reasonably identifiable as
58 exempt from execution has been electronically deposited into the account; or (2) if
59 no such money has been deposited, $400. (NRS 21.105) Section 5 revises those
60 exemptions to eliminate the exemption concerning money deposited within the 45
61 days immediately preceding the date on which the writ is levied and, instead,
62 exempts $5,000 in a personal bank account, regardless of whether any money
63 reasonably identifiable as exempt was deposited in the account before the writ is
64 levied.
65 Sections 2, 3, 6 and 7 of this bill revise the form of a writ of execution and of
66 certain notices and interrogatories required to be served in connection with a writ of
67 execution, attachment or garnishment, to reflect the changes set forth in sections 1,
68 4, 5 and 8-11.

25 PROCEDURE FOR CLAIMING EXEMPT PROPERTY
26
27 If you believe that the money or property taken from you

29 court an executed claim of exemption. A copy of the claim of
30 exemption must be served upon the sheriff, the garnishee and
31 the judgment creditor within 10 days after the notice of
32 execution or garnishment is served on you by mail pursuant
33 to NRS 21.076 which identifies the specific property that is
34 being levied on. The property must be released by the
35 garnishee or the sheriff within 9 judicial days after you serve
36 the claim of exemption upon the sheriff, garnishee and
37 judgment creditor, unless the sheriff or garnishee receives a
38 copy of an objection to the claim of exemption and a notice
39 for a hearing to determine the issue of exemption. If this
40 happens, a hearing will be held to determine whether the
41 property or money is exempt. The objection to the claim of
42 exemption and notice for the hearing to determine the issue of
43 exemption must be filed within 8 judicial days after the claim
44 of exemption is served on the judgment creditor by mail or in
45 person and served on the judgment debtor, the sheriff and any

3 money is exempt must be held within 7 judicial days after the
4 objection to the claim of exemption and notice for the hearing
5 is filed. You may be able to have your property released more
6 quickly if you mail to the judgment creditor or the attorney of
7 the judgment creditor written proof that the property is
8 exempt. Such proof may include, without limitation, a letter
9 from the government, an annual statement from a pension
10 fund, receipts for payment, copies of checks, records from
11 financial institutions or any other document which
12 demonstrates that the money in your account is exempt.
13
14 IF YOU DO NOT FILE THE EXECUTED CLAIM OF
15 EXEMPTION WITHIN THE TIME SPECIFIED, YOUR
16 PROPERTY MAY BE SOLD AND THE MONEY GIVEN
17 TO THE JUDGMENT CREDITOR, EVEN IF THE
18 PROPERTY OR MONEY IS EXEMPT.

9 the notice of execution or garnishment is served on you by
10 mail pursuant to NRS 21.076 which identifies the specific
11 property that is being levied on. The property must be
12 released by the garnishee or the sheriff within 9 judicial days
13 after you serve the claim of exemption upon the sheriff,
14 garnishee and judgment creditor, unless the sheriff or
15 garnishee receives a copy of an objection to the claim of
16 exemption and a notice for a hearing to determine the issue of
17 exemption. If this happens, a hearing will be held to
18 determine whether the property or money is exempt. The
19 objection to the claim of exemption and notice for the hearing
20 to determine the issue of exemption must be filed within 8

24 judicial days before the date set for the hearing. The hearing
25 must be held within 7 judicial days after the objection to the
26 claim of exemption and notice for a hearing is filed. You may
27 be able to have your property released more quickly if you
28 mail to the judgment creditor or the attorney of the judgment
