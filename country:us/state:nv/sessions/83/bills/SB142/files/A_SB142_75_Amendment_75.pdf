execution. (BDR 2-707)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.

~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to civil actions; requiring the Department of [Business and
Industry] Taxation to adjust monetary amounts set forth in provisions
governing property exempt from execution every 3 years; revising the
amount of disposable earnings of a judgment debtor that is exempt
from execution under certain circumstances; revising the definition of
“earnings” for the purposes of provisions governing that exemption;
revising the amount of money held in a personal bank account of a
judgment debtor that is exempt from execution under certain
circumstances; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law allows a judgment creditor to obtain a writ of execution, attachment or
2 garnishment to levy on the property of a judgment debtor or defendant in certain
3 circumstances. (Chapters 21 and 31 of NRS) With certain exceptions, existing law exempts
4 certain property from execution, thereby prohibiting such property from being the subject of
5 such a writ. (NRS 21.090-21.105) Among the property exempt from execution, certain
6 property is exempt only up to a specified amount. For example, payments received by a
7 judgment debtor or by a person upon whom the judgment debtor is dependent as
8 compensation for personal injury that are not compensation for pain and suffering or actual
9 pecuniary loss are exempt from execution to the extent that such payments do not exceed
10 $16,150. (NRS 21.090) Additionally, under existing law, with certain exceptions, $605,000 in
11 equity in property designated as a homestead, including certain payments made to a defendant
12 or spouse in that amount upon the sale of homestead property under certain circumstances, is
13 protected from a forced sale upon execution or any final process from any court. (NRS
14 21.090, 115.010, 115.050, 115.055) Sections 1, 4, 5 and 8-11 of this bill require the monetary
15 amounts set forth in the provisions of existing law governing property exempt from execution
16 to be adjusted on April 1, 2026, and every 3 years thereafter in amount equal to the percentage
17 of increase or decrease in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, West Region
18 (All Items), as published by the United States Department of Labor for the period beginning
19 on January 1 and ending on December 31 of the year immediately preceding the date of
20 adjustment. Section 1 requires the Department of [Business and Industry,] Taxation, on or
21 before February 1 of each year in which an adjustment is required, to determine the amount of
22 the adjustment, establish the adjusted amounts to take effect on April 1 of that year and post
23 the adjusted amounts on the Internet website of the Department.

Senate Amendment No. 75 to Senate Bill No. 142 Page 4
24 Under existing law, the greater of the following amounts are exempt from execution: (1)
25 82 percent of a judgment debtor’s disposable earnings for any workweek if his or her gross
26 weekly salary or wage on the date the most recent writ of garnishment was issued was $770 or
27 less; (2) 75 percent of a judgment debtor’s disposable earnings for any workweek if his or her
28 gross weekly salary or wage on the date the most recent writ of garnishment was issued
29 exceeded $770; or (3) 50 times the federal minimum hourly wage. (NRS 21.090, 31.295)
30 Sections 4 and 8 revise that exemption to instead exempt from execution $850 of the
31 disposable earnings of a judgment debtor during a workweek and either 90 percent of the
32 disposable earnings of the judgment debtor during that week that exceed $850, if the
33 disposable earnings of the judgment debtor during that week are $1,200 or less, or 85 percent
34 of the disposable earnings of the judgment debtor during that week that exceed $850, if the
35 disposable earnings of the judgment debtor during that week are more than $1,200. Because
36 sections 4 and 8 eliminate the use of a judgment debtor’s gross weekly salary or wage in
37 determining the amount of the exception, section 12 of this bill repeals provisions setting
38 forth the manner in which gross weekly salary or wage must be determined.
39 For the purposes of provisions governing the exemption from execution for the
40 disposable earnings of a judgment debtor, existing law defines: (1) “earnings” to mean
41 compensation paid or payable for personal services performed by a judgment debtor in the
42 regular course of business; and (2) “disposable earnings” to mean that part of the earnings of a
43 judgment debtor remaining after the deduction from those earnings of any amounts required
44 by law to be withheld. (NRS 21.090, 31.295) Sections 4 and 8 revise the definition of the
45 term “earnings” to specify that the term includes compensation paid or payable for personal
46 services performed by a judgment debtor in the regular course of business, regardless of
47 whether the judgment debtor performed such services as an employee or independent
48 contractor.
49 Existing law exempts from execution: (1) $2,000 in a personal bank account if, within the
50 45 days immediately preceding the date on which a writ of execution or garnishment is levied
51 on the account, money which is reasonably identifiable as exempt from execution has been
52 electronically deposited into the account; or (2) if no such money has been deposited, $400.
53 (NRS 21.105) Section 5 revises those exemptions to eliminate the exemption concerning
54 money deposited within the 45 days immediately preceding the date on which the writ is
55 levied and, instead, exempts $5,000 in a personal bank account, regardless of whether any
56 money reasonably identifiable as exempt was deposited in the account before the writ is
57 levied.
58 Sections 2, 3, 6 and 7 of this bill revise the form of a writ of execution and of certain
59 notices and interrogatories required to be served in connection with a writ of execution,
60 attachment or garnishment, to reflect the changes set forth in sections 1, 4, 5 and 8-11.

SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 21 of NRS is hereby amended by adding thereto a new

4 115.050 and 115.055 must be adjusted on April 1, 2026, and every 3 years
5 thereafter, by a percentage equal to the percentage of increase or decrease in the
6 Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, West Region (All Items), as
7 published by the United States Department of Labor for the period beginning on
8 January 1 and ending on December 31 of the year immediately preceding the
9 date of adjustment or, if that index ceases to be published by the United States
10 Department of Labor, the published index that most closely resembles that index,
11 as determined by the Department of [Business and Industry.] Taxation. The
12 adjusted amount must be rounded off to the next larger integral multiple of $10.

24 PROCEDURE FOR CLAIMING EXEMPT PROPERTY
25
26 If you believe that the money or property taken from you is exempt,
27 you must complete and file with the clerk of the court an executed claim of
28 exemption. A copy of the claim of exemption must be served upon the
29 sheriff, the garnishee and the judgment creditor within 10 days after the
30 notice of execution or garnishment is served on you by mail pursuant to
31 NRS 21.076 which identifies the specific property that is being levied on.
32 The property must be released by the garnishee or the sheriff within 9
33 judicial days after you serve the claim of exemption upon the sheriff,
34 garnishee and judgment creditor, unless the sheriff or garnishee receives a
35 copy of an objection to the claim of exemption and a notice for a hearing to
36 determine the issue of exemption. If this happens, a hearing will be held to
37 determine whether the property or money is exempt. The objection to the
38 claim of exemption and notice for the hearing to determine the issue of
39 exemption must be filed within 8 judicial days after the claim of exemption
40 is served on the judgment creditor by mail or in person and served on the
41 judgment debtor, the sheriff and any garnishee not less than 5 judicial days
42 before the date set for the hearing. The hearing to determine whether the
43 property or money is exempt must be held within 7 judicial days after the
44 objection to the claim of exemption and notice for the hearing is filed. You
45 may be able to have your property released more quickly if you mail to the
46 judgment creditor or the attorney of the judgment creditor written proof that
47 the property is exempt. Such proof may include, without limitation, a letter
48 from the government, an annual statement from a pension fund, receipts for
49 payment, copies of checks, records from financial institutions or any other
50 document which demonstrates that the money in your account is exempt.
51
52 IF YOU DO NOT FILE THE EXECUTED CLAIM OF EXEMPTION
53 WITHIN THE TIME SPECIFIED, YOUR PROPERTY MAY BE SOLD

10 PROCEDURE FOR CLAIMING EXEMPT PROPERTY
11
12 If you believe that the money or property taken from you is exempt or
13 necessary for the support of you or your family, you must file with the clerk
14 of the court on a form provided by the clerk an executed claim of
15 exemption. A copy of the claim of exemption must be served upon the
16 sheriff, the garnishee and the judgment creditor within 10 days after the
17 notice of execution or garnishment is served on you by mail pursuant to
18 NRS 21.076 which identifies the specific property that is being levied on.
19 The property must be released by the garnishee or the sheriff within 9
20 judicial days after you serve the claim of exemption upon the sheriff,
21 garnishee and judgment creditor, unless the sheriff or garnishee receives a
22 copy of an objection to the claim of exemption and a notice for a hearing to
23 determine the issue of exemption. If this happens, a hearing will be held to
24 determine whether the property or money is exempt. The objection to the
25 claim of exemption and notice for the hearing to determine the issue of
26 exemption must be filed within 8 judicial days after the claim of exemption
27 is served on the judgment creditor by mail or in person and served on the
28 judgment debtor, the sheriff and any garnishee not less than 5 judicial days
29 before the date set for the hearing. The hearing must be held within 7
30 judicial days after the objection to the claim of exemption and notice for a
31 hearing is filed. You may be able to have your property released more
32 quickly if you mail to the judgment creditor or the attorney of the judgment
33 creditor written proof that the property is exempt. Such proof may include,
34 without limitation, a letter from the government, an annual statement from a

9 [What is the gross weekly salary or wage of the employee? The gross
10 weekly salary or wage of an employee must be determined as follows:
11 1. Except as otherwise provided in numbers 2 and 3 below, by
12 dividing the employee’s gross earnings for the current calendar year as of
13 the date the most recent writ of garnishment was issued by the total number
14 of weeks the employee has worked in the current calendar year.
15 2. If the most recent writ of garnishment was issued at the beginning
16 of the current calendar year before the employee received any earnings in
17 the current calendar year, but the employee received earnings in the
18 previous calendar year, by dividing the employee’s gross earnings for the
19 previous calendar year by the total number of weeks the employee worked
20 in the previous calendar year.
21 3. If the employee has not been employed long enough to have been
22 paid as of the date the most recent writ of garnishment was issued, or if the
23 provisions of number 1 or 2 above do not otherwise apply, the gross weekly
24 salary or wage of the employee is the anticipated gross weekly earnings of
25 the employee as determined by his or her employer.
26 For the purpose of determining the total number of weeks the employee
27 has worked in the current calendar year or the total number of weeks the
28 employee worked in the previous calendar year, as applicable, if the total
29 number of weeks is not exact, the number must be rounded down if the
30 number of days the employee was on the payroll of his or her employer in
31 excess of a whole week is 3 days or less, and rounded up if the number of
32 days the employee was on the payroll of his or her employer in excess of a
33 whole week is 4 days or more.

31 Sec. 8. NRS 31.295 is hereby amended to read as follows:
32 31.295 1. As used in this section:
33 (a) “Disposable earnings” means that part of the earnings of any person
34 remaining after the deduction from those earnings of any amounts required by law
35 to be withheld.
36 (b) “Earnings” means compensation paid or payable for personal services

41 compensation received by a judgment debtor that is in the possession of the
42 judgment debtor, compensation held in accounts maintained in a bank or any other

1 if the person’s [gross weekly salary or wage on the date the most recent writ of
2 garnishment was issued exceeded $770; or
3 (c) The amount by which the person’s disposable earnings for that week
4 exceed 50 times the federal minimum hourly wage prescribed by section 206(a)(1)
5 of the federal Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, 29 U.S.C. §§ 201 et seq., in effect
6 at the time the] disposable earnings [are payable,
7  whichever is less.] for that workweek were more than $1,200, as adjusted
8 pursuant to section 1 of this act.

10 (a) Any order of any court for the support of any person.
11 (b) Any order of any court of bankruptcy.
12 (c) Any debt due for any state or federal tax.

16 (a) Fifty percent of the person’s disposable earnings for that week if the person
17 is supporting a spouse or child other than the spouse or child for whom the order of
18 support was rendered; or
19 (b) Sixty percent of the person’s disposable earnings for that week if the person
20 is not supporting such a spouse or child,
21  except that if the garnishment is to enforce a previous order of support with
22 respect to a period occurring at least 12 weeks before the beginning of the
23 workweek, the limits which apply to the situations described in paragraphs (a) and
24 (b) are 55 percent and 65 percent, respectively.
25 Sec. 9. NRS 115.010 is hereby amended to read as follows:
26 115.010 1. The homestead is not subject to forced sale on execution or any
27 final process from any court, except as otherwise provided by subsections 2, 3 and
28 5, and NRS 115.090 and except as otherwise required by federal law.
29 2. The exemption provided in subsection 1 extends only to that amount of
30 equity in the property held by the claimant which does not exceed $605,000 , as
31 adjusted pursuant to section 1 of this act, in value, unless allodial title has been
32 established and not relinquished, in which case the exemption provided in
33 subsection 1 extends to all equity in the dwelling, its appurtenances and the land on
34 which it is located.
35 3. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 4, the exemption provided in
36 subsection 1 does not extend to process to enforce the payment of obligations
37 contracted for the purchase of the property, or for improvements made thereon,
38 including any mechanic’s lien lawfully obtained, or for legal taxes, or for:
39 (a) Any mortgage or deed of trust thereon executed and given, including,
40 without limitation, any second or subsequent mortgage, mortgage obtained through
41 refinancing, line of credit taken against the property and a home equity loan; or
42 (b) Any lien to which prior consent has been given through the acceptance of
43 property subject to any recorded declaration of restrictions, deed restriction,
44 restrictive covenant or equitable servitude, specifically including any lien in favor
45 of an association pursuant to NRS 116.3116 or 117.070,
46  by both spouses, when that relation exists.
47 4. If allodial title has been established and not relinquished, the exemption
48 provided in subsection 1 extends to process to enforce the payment of obligations

1 (b) Any lien even if prior consent has been given through the acceptance of
2 property subject to any recorded declaration of restrictions, deed restriction,
3 restrictive covenant or equitable servitude, specifically including any lien in favor
4 of an association pursuant to NRS 116.3116 or 117.070,
5  unless a waiver for the specific obligation to which the judgment relates has been
6 executed by all allodial titleholders of the property.
7 5. Establishment of allodial title does not exempt the property from forfeiture
8 pursuant to NRS 179.1156 to 179.121, inclusive, 179.1211 to 179.1235, inclusive,
9 or 207.350 to 207.520, inclusive.
10 6. Any declaration of homestead which has been filed before July 1, 2007,
11 shall be deemed to have been amended on that date by extending the homestead
12 exemption commensurate with any increase in the amount of equity held by the
13 claimant in the property selected and claimed for the exemption up to the amount
14 permitted by law on that date, but the increase does not impair the right of any
15 creditor to execute upon the property when that right existed before July 1, 2007.
16 Sec. 10. NRS 115.050 is hereby amended to read as follows:
17 115.050 1. Whenever execution has been issued against the property of a
18 party claiming the property as a homestead, and the creditor in the judgment makes
19 an oath before the judge of the district court of the county in which the property is
20 situated that the amount of equity held by the claimant in the property exceeds, to
21 the best of the creditor’s information and belief, the sum of $605,000, as adjusted
22 pursuant to section 1 of this act, the judge shall, upon notice to the debtor, appoint
23 three disinterested and competent persons as appraisers to estimate and report as to
24 the amount of equity held by the claimant in the property and, if the amount of
25 equity exceeds the sum of $605,000, as adjusted pursuant to section 1 of this act,
26 determine whether the property can be divided so as to leave the property subject to
27 the homestead exemption without material injury.
28 2. If it appears, upon the report, to the satisfaction of the judge that the
29 property can be thus divided, the judge shall order the excess to be sold under
30 execution. If it appears that the property cannot be thus divided, and the amount of
31 equity held by the claimant in the property exceeds the exemption allowed by this
32 chapter, the judge shall order the entire property to be sold, and out of the proceeds
33 the sum of $605,000 , as adjusted pursuant to section 1 of this act, to be paid to
34 the defendant in execution, and the excess to be applied to the satisfaction on the
35 execution. No bid under $605,000 may be received by the officer making the sale.
36 3. When the execution is against a spouse, the judge may direct the $605,000 ,
37 as adjusted pursuant to section 1 of this act, to be deposited in court, to be paid out
38 only upon the joint receipt of both spouses, and, except as otherwise provided in
39 NRS 115.055, the deposit possesses all the protection against legal process and
40 voluntary disposition by either spouse as did the original homestead.
41 4. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 115.055, if the sum of $605,000 , as
42 adjusted pursuant to section 1 of this act, is paid to the defendant in execution
43 pursuant to subsection 2 or to a spouse pursuant to subsection 3, such sum of
44 $605,000 , as adjusted pursuant to section 1 of this act, possesses all the protection
45 against legal process and voluntary disposition by the defendant or spouse as did
46 the original homestead.
47 Sec. 11. NRS 115.055 is hereby amended to read as follows:
48 115.055 Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the proceeds of
49 $605,000 , as adjusted pursuant to section 1 of this act, from the sale of a
50 homestead pursuant to subsection 2 or 3 of NRS 115.050 are only exempt from
51 execution if:
52 1. Such proceeds are reinvested in another property of like kind for which the
53 declaration of a homestead will be made; and

Senate Amendment No. 75 to Senate Bill No. 142 Page 24
1 2. The other property is:
2 (a) Identified not later than 45 days after the sale of the homestead; and
3 (b) Taken possession of not later than 180 days after the sale of the homestead.
4 Sec. 12. NRS 21.005 and 31.2955 are hereby repealed.
