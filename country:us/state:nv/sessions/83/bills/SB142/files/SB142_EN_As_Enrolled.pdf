Senate Bill No. 142–Senator Doñate
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to civil actions; requiring the Department of
Taxation to adjust monetary amounts set forth in provisions
governing property exempt from execution every 3 years;
revising the amount of disposable earnings of a judgment
debtor that is exempt from execution under certain
circumstances; revising the definition of “earnings” for the
purposes of provisions governing that exemption; revising
the amount of money held in a personal bank account of a
judgment debtor that is exempt from execution under certain
circumstances; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law allows a judgment creditor to obtain a writ of execution,
attachment or garnishment to levy on the property of a judgment debtor or
defendant in certain circumstances. (Chapters 21 and 31 of NRS) With certain
exceptions, existing law exempts certain property from execution, thereby
prohibiting such property from being the subject of such a writ. (NRS 21.090-
21.105) Among the property exempt from execution, certain property is exempt
only up to a specified amount. For example, payments received by a judgment
debtor or by a person upon whom the judgment debtor is dependent as
compensation for personal injury that are not compensation for pain and suffering
or actual pecuniary loss are exempt from execution to the extent that such payments
do not exceed $16,150. (NRS 21.090) Additionally, under existing law, with certain
exceptions, $605,000 in equity in property designated as a homestead, including
certain payments made to a defendant or spouse in that amount upon the sale of
homestead property under certain circumstances, is protected from a forced sale
upon execution or any final process from any court. (NRS 21.090, 115.010,
115.050, 115.055) Sections 1, 4, 5 and 8-11 of this bill require the monetary
amounts set forth in the provisions of existing law governing property exempt from
execution to be adjusted on April 1, 2026, and every 3 years thereafter in amount
equal to the percentage of increase or decrease in the Consumer Price Index for All
Urban Consumers, West Region (All Items), as published by the United States
Department of Labor for the period beginning on January 1 and ending on
December 31 of the year immediately preceding the date of adjustment. Section 1
requires the Department of Taxation, on or before February 1 of each year in which
an adjustment is required, to determine the amount of the adjustment, establish the
adjusted amounts to take effect on April 1 of that year and post the adjusted
amounts on the Internet website of the Department.
Under existing law, the greater of the following amounts are exempt from
execution: (1) 82 percent of a judgment debtor’s disposable earnings for any
workweek if his or her gross weekly salary or wage on the date the most recent writ
of garnishment was issued was $770 or less; (2) 75 percent of a judgment debtor’s
disposable earnings for any workweek if his or her gross weekly salary or wage on
the date the most recent writ of garnishment was issued exceeded $770; or (3) 50
times the federal minimum hourly wage. (NRS 21.090, 31.295) Sections 4 and 8
revise that exemption to instead exempt from execution $850 of the disposable
earnings of a judgment debtor during a workweek and either 90 percent of the
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 2 –
disposable earnings of the judgment debtor during that week that exceed $850, if
the disposable earnings of the judgment debtor during that week are $1,200 or less,
or 85 percent of the disposable earnings of the judgment debtor during that week
that exceed $850, if the disposable earnings of the judgment debtor during that
week are more than $1,200. Because sections 4 and 8 eliminate the use of a
judgment debtor’s gross weekly salary or wage in determining the amount of the
exception, section 12 of this bill repeals provisions setting forth the manner in
which gross weekly salary or wage must be determined.
For the purposes of provisions governing the exemption from execution for the
disposable earnings of a judgment debtor, existing law defines: (1) “earnings” to
mean compensation paid or payable for personal services performed by a judgment
debtor in the regular course of business; and (2) “disposable earnings” to mean that
part of the earnings of a judgment debtor remaining after the deduction from those
earnings of any amounts required by law to be withheld. (NRS 21.090, 31.295)
Sections 4 and 8 revise the definition of the term “earnings” to specify that the
term includes compensation paid or payable for personal services performed by a
judgment debtor in the regular course of business, regardless of whether the
judgment debtor performed such services as an employee or independent
contractor.
Existing law exempts from execution: (1) $2,000 in a personal bank account if,
within the 45 days immediately preceding the date on which a writ of execution or
garnishment is levied on the account, money which is reasonably identifiable as
exempt from execution has been electronically deposited into the account; or (2) if
no such money has been deposited, $400. (NRS 21.105) Section 5 revises those
exemptions to eliminate the exemption concerning money deposited within the 45
days immediately preceding the date on which the writ is levied and, instead,
exempts $5,000 in a personal bank account, regardless of whether any money
reasonably identifiable as exempt was deposited in the account before the writ is
levied.
Sections 2, 3, 6 and 7 of this bill revise the form of a writ of execution and of
certain notices and interrogatories required to be served in connection with a writ of
execution, attachment or garnishment, to reflect the changes set forth in sections 1,
4, 5 and 8-11.
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.

2026, and every 3 years thereafter, by a percentage equal to the
percentage of increase or decrease in the Consumer Price Index
for All Urban Consumers, West Region (All Items), as published
by the United States Department of Labor for the period beginning
on January 1 and ending on December 31 of the year immediately
preceding the date of adjustment or, if that index ceases to be

PROCEDURE FOR CLAIMING EXEMPT PROPERTY
If you believe that the money or property taken from you
is exempt, you must complete and file with the clerk of the
court an executed claim of exemption. A copy of the claim of
exemption must be served upon the sheriff, the garnishee and
the judgment creditor within 10 days after the notice of
execution or garnishment is served on you by mail pursuant
to NRS 21.076 which identifies the specific property that is
being levied on. The property must be released by the
garnishee or the sheriff within 9 judicial days after you serve
the claim of exemption upon the sheriff, garnishee and
judgment creditor, unless the sheriff or garnishee receives a
copy of an objection to the claim of exemption and a notice
for a hearing to determine the issue of exemption. If this
happens, a hearing will be held to determine whether the
property or money is exempt. The objection to the claim of
exemption and notice for the hearing to determine the issue of
exemption must be filed within 8 judicial days after the claim
of exemption is served on the judgment creditor by mail or in
person and served on the judgment debtor, the sheriff and any
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 10 –
garnishee not less than 5 judicial days before the date set for
the hearing. The hearing to determine whether the property or
money is exempt must be held within 7 judicial days after the
objection to the claim of exemption and notice for the hearing
is filed. You may be able to have your property released more
quickly if you mail to the judgment creditor or the attorney of
the judgment creditor written proof that the property is
exempt. Such proof may include, without limitation, a letter
from the government, an annual statement from a pension
fund, receipts for payment, copies of checks, records from
financial institutions or any other document which
demonstrates that the money in your account is exempt.
IF YOU DO NOT FILE THE EXECUTED CLAIM OF
EXEMPTION WITHIN THE TIME SPECIFIED, YOUR
PROPERTY MAY BE SOLD AND THE MONEY GIVEN
TO THE JUDGMENT CREDITOR, EVEN IF THE
PROPERTY OR MONEY IS EXEMPT.

institution makes an incorrect determination after applying

institution must adjust its actions with respect to a writ of execution

by the clerk an executed claim of exemption. A copy of the
claim of exemption must be served upon the sheriff, the

mail pursuant to NRS 21.076 which identifies the specific
property that is being levied on. The property must be
released by the garnishee or the sheriff within 9 judicial days
after you serve the claim of exemption upon the sheriff,
garnishee and judgment creditor, unless the sheriff or
garnishee receives a copy of an objection to the claim of
exemption and a notice for a hearing to determine the issue of
exemption. If this happens, a hearing will be held to
determine whether the property or money is exempt. The
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 23 –
objection to the claim of exemption and notice for the hearing
to determine the issue of exemption must be filed within 8
judicial days after the claim of exemption is served on the
judgment creditor by mail or in person and served on the
judgment debtor, the sheriff and any garnishee not less than 5
judicial days before the date set for the hearing. The hearing
must be held within 7 judicial days after the objection to the
claim of exemption and notice for a hearing is filed. You may
be able to have your property released more quickly if you
mail to the judgment creditor or the attorney of the judgment
creditor written proof that the property is exempt. Such proof
may include, without limitation, a letter from the government,
an annual statement from a pension fund, receipts for
payment, copies of checks, records from financial institutions
or any other document which demonstrates that the money in
your account is exempt.
IF YOU DO NOT FILE THE EXECUTED CLAIM OF
EXEMPTION WITHIN THE TIME SPECIFIED, YOUR
PROPERTY MAY BE SOLD AND THE MONEY GIVEN
TO THE JUDGMENT CREDITOR, EVEN IF THE
PROPERTY OR MONEY IS EXEMPT.
If you received this notice with a notice of a hearing for
attachment and you believe that the money or property which
would be taken from you by a writ of attachment is exempt or
necessary for the support of you or your family, you are
entitled to describe to the court at the hearing why you
believe your property is exempt. You may also file a motion
with the court for a discharge of the writ of attachment. You
may make that motion any time before trial. A hearing will be
held on that motion.
IF YOU DO NOT FILE THE MOTION BEFORE THE
TRIAL, YOUR PROPERTY MAY BE SOLD AND
THE MONEY GIVEN TO THE PLAINTIFF, EVEN IF THE
PROPERTY OR MONEY IS EXEMPT OR NECESSARY
FOR THE SUPPORT OF YOU OR YOUR FAMILY.

[What is the gross weekly salary or wage of the
employee? The gross weekly salary or wage of an employee
must be determined as follows:
1. Except as otherwise provided in numbers 2 and 3
below, by dividing the employee’s gross earnings for the
current calendar year as of the date the most recent writ of
garnishment was issued by the total number of weeks the
employee has worked in the current calendar year.
2. If the most recent writ of garnishment was issued at
the beginning of the current calendar year before the
employee received any earnings in the current calendar year,
but the employee received earnings in the previous calendar
year, by dividing the employee’s gross earnings for the
previous calendar year by the total number of weeks the
employee worked in the previous calendar year.
3. If the employee has not been employed long enough
to have been paid as of the date the most recent writ of
garnishment was issued, or if the provisions of number 1 or 2
above do not otherwise apply, the gross weekly salary or
wage of the employee is the anticipated gross weekly
earnings of the employee as determined by his or her
employer.
For the purpose of determining the total number of weeks
the employee has worked in the current calendar year or the
-

total number of weeks the employee worked in the previous
calendar year, as applicable, if the total number of weeks is
not exact, the number must be rounded down if the number of
days the employee was on the payroll of his or her employer
in excess of a whole week is 3 days or less, and rounded up if
the number of days the employee was on the payroll of his or
her employer in excess of a whole week is 4 days or more.

subject to garnishment if the financial institution reasonably
identifies that an electronic deposit of money has been made
into the account within the immediately preceding 45 days

the support of any person. The amount which is not subject to
garnishment does not apply to each account of the judgment
debtor, but rather is an aggregate amount that is not subject to
garnishment.

2. The garnishee shall answer the interrogatories in writing
upon oath or affirmation and submit the answers to the sheriff
within the time required by the writ. The garnishee shall submit his
or her answers to the judgment debtor within the same time. If the
garnishee fails to do so, the garnishee shall be deemed in default.
Sec. 8. NRS 31.295 is hereby amended to read as follows:
31.295 1. As used in this section:
(a) “Disposable earnings” means that part of the earnings of any
person remaining after the deduction from those earnings of any
amounts required by law to be withheld.
(b) “Earnings” means compensation paid or payable for personal
services performed by a judgment debtor in the regular course of
business, regardless of whether the judgment debtor performed
such services as an employee or independent contractor, including,
without limitation, compensation designated as income, wages, tips,
a salary, a commission or a bonus. The term includes compensation
received by a judgment debtor that is in the possession of the
judgment debtor, compensation held in accounts maintained in a
bank or any other financial institution or, in the case of a receivable,
compensation that is due the judgment debtor.
2. The maximum amount of the aggregate disposable earnings
of a person which are subject to garnishment may not exceed:
(a) [Eighteen] Ten percent of the person’s disposable earnings
for the relevant workweek that exceed $850, as adjusted pursuant
to section 1 of this act, if the person’s [gross weekly salary or wage
on the date the most recent writ of garnishment was issued was
$770] disposable earnings for that workweek were $1,200, as
adjusted pursuant to section 1 of this act, or less; or
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 28 –
(b) [Twenty-five] Fifteen percent of the person’s disposable
earnings for the relevant workweek that exceed $850, as adjusted
pursuant to section 1 of this act, if the person’s [gross weekly
salary or wage on the date the most recent writ of garnishment was
issued exceeded $770; or
(c) The amount by which the person’s disposable earnings for
that week exceed 50 times the federal minimum hourly wage
prescribed by section 206(a)(1) of the federal Fair Labor Standards
Act of 1938, 29 U.S.C. §§ 201 et seq., in effect at the time the]
disposable earnings [are payable,
 whichever is less.] for that workweek were more than $1,200, as
adjusted pursuant to section 1 of this act.
3. The restrictions of subsection 2 do not apply in the case of:
(a) Any order of any court for the support of any person.
(b) Any order of any court of bankruptcy.
(c) Any debt due for any state or federal tax.
4. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the
maximum amount of the aggregate disposable earnings of a person
for any workweek which are subject to garnishment to enforce any
order for the support of any person may not exceed:
(a) Fifty percent of the person’s disposable earnings for that
week if the person is supporting a spouse or child other than the
spouse or child for whom the order of support was rendered; or
(b) Sixty percent of the person’s disposable earnings for that
week if the person is not supporting such a spouse or child,
 except that if the garnishment is to enforce a previous order of
support with respect to a period occurring at least 12 weeks before
the beginning of the workweek, the limits which apply to the
situations described in paragraphs (a) and (b) are 55 percent and 65
percent, respectively.
Sec. 9. NRS 115.010 is hereby amended to read as follows:
115.010 1. The homestead is not subject to forced sale on
execution or any final process from any court, except as otherwise
provided by subsections 2, 3 and 5, and NRS 115.090 and except as
otherwise required by federal law.
2. The exemption provided in subsection 1 extends only to that
amount of equity in the property held by the claimant which does
not exceed $605,000 , as adjusted pursuant to section 1 of this act,
in value, unless allodial title has been established and not
relinquished, in which case the exemption provided in subsection 1
extends to all equity in the dwelling, its appurtenances and the land
on which it is located.

– 29 –
3. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 4, the exemption
provided in subsection 1 does not extend to process to enforce the
payment of obligations contracted for the purchase of the property,
or for improvements made thereon, including any mechanic’s lien
lawfully obtained, or for legal taxes, or for:
(a) Any mortgage or deed of trust thereon executed and given,
including, without limitation, any second or subsequent mortgage,
mortgage obtained through refinancing, line of credit taken against
the property and a home equity loan; or
(b) Any lien to which prior consent has been given through the
acceptance of property subject to any recorded declaration of
restrictions, deed restriction, restrictive covenant or equitable
servitude, specifically including any lien in favor of an association
pursuant to NRS 116.3116 or 117.070,
 by both spouses, when that relation exists.
4. If allodial title has been established and not relinquished, the
exemption provided in subsection 1 extends to process to enforce
the payment of obligations contracted for the purchase of the
property, and for improvements made thereon, including any
mechanic’s lien lawfully obtained, and for legal taxes levied by a
state or local government, and for:
(a) Any mortgage or deed of trust thereon; and
(b) Any lien even if prior consent has been given through the
acceptance of property subject to any recorded declaration of
restrictions, deed restriction, restrictive covenant or equitable
servitude, specifically including any lien in favor of an association
pursuant to NRS 116.3116 or 117.070,
 unless a waiver for the specific obligation to which the judgment
relates has been executed by all allodial titleholders of the property.
5. Establishment of allodial title does not exempt the property
from forfeiture pursuant to NRS 179.1156 to 179.121, inclusive,
179.1211 to 179.1235, inclusive, or 207.350 to 207.520, inclusive.
6. Any declaration of homestead which has been filed before
July 1, 2007, shall be deemed to have been amended on that date by
extending the homestead exemption commensurate with any
increase in the amount of equity held by the claimant in the property
selected and claimed for the exemption up to the amount permitted
by law on that date, but the increase does not impair the right of any
creditor to execute upon the property when that right existed before
July 1, 2007.
Sec. 10. NRS 115.050 is hereby amended to read as follows:
115.050 1. Whenever execution has been issued against the
property of a party claiming the property as a homestead, and
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 30 –
the creditor in the judgment makes an oath before the judge of the
district court of the county in which the property is situated that
the amount of equity held by the claimant in the property exceeds, to
the best of the creditor’s information and belief, the sum of
$605,000, as adjusted pursuant to section 1 of this act, the judge
shall, upon notice to the debtor, appoint three disinterested and
competent persons as appraisers to estimate and report as to the
amount of equity held by the claimant in the property and, if the
amount of equity exceeds the sum of $605,000, as adjusted
pursuant to section 1 of this act, determine whether the property
can be divided so as to leave the property subject to the homestead
exemption without material injury.
2. If it appears, upon the report, to the satisfaction of the judge
that the property can be thus divided, the judge shall order the
excess to be sold under execution. If it appears that the property
cannot be thus divided, and the amount of equity held by the
claimant in the property exceeds the exemption allowed by this
chapter, the judge shall order the entire property to be sold, and out
of the proceeds the sum of $605,000 , as adjusted pursuant to
section 1 of this act, to be paid to the defendant in execution, and
the excess to be applied to the satisfaction on the execution. No bid
under $605,000 may be received by the officer making the sale.
3. When the execution is against a spouse, the judge may direct
the $605,000 , as adjusted pursuant to section 1 of this act, to be
deposited in court, to be paid out only upon the joint receipt of both
spouses, and, except as otherwise provided in NRS 115.055, the
deposit possesses all the protection against legal process and
voluntary disposition by either spouse as did the original homestead.
4. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 115.055, if the sum of
$605,000 , as adjusted pursuant to section 1 of this act, is paid to
the defendant in execution pursuant to subsection 2 or to a spouse
pursuant to subsection 3, such sum of $605,000 , as adjusted
pursuant to section 1 of this act, possesses all the protection against
legal process and voluntary disposition by the defendant or spouse
as did the original homestead.
Sec. 11. NRS 115.055 is hereby amended to read as follows:
115.055 Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the
proceeds of $605,000 , as adjusted pursuant to section 1 of this act,
from the sale of a homestead pursuant to subsection 2 or 3 of NRS
115.050 are only exempt from execution if:
1. Such proceeds are reinvested in another property of like kind
for which the declaration of a homestead will be made; and
2. The other property is:
-

– 31 –
(a) Identified not later than 45 days after the sale of the
homestead; and
(b) Taken possession of not later than 180 days after the sale of
the homestead.
Sec. 12. NRS 21.005 and 31.2955 are hereby repealed.
