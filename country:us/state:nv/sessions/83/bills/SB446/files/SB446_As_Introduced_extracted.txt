EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; revising the qualifications for a pupil
to participate in a work-based learning program; revising
the requirements relating to criminal background
investigations of volunteers in work-based learning
programs; authorizing, under certain circumstances, the
board of trustees of a school district to reimburse a
business, agency or organization for the cost of an
investigation into the criminal background of an
employee who volunteers in a work-based learning
program; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the board of trustees of a school district or the
2 governing body of a charter school to offer a work-based learning program upon
3 application to and with the approval of the Superintendent of Education. An
4 application to offer a work-based learning program must include the qualifications
5 of a pupil to participate in the work-based learning program. Such qualifications
6 must allow a majority of pupils to be eligible to participate in the work-based
7 learning program. (NRS 389.167) Section 1 of this bill provides instead that such
8 qualifications must allow a majority of pupils who are least 16 years of age to be
9 eligible to participate in the work-based learning program.

10 Existing law requires, with certain exceptions, a volunteer at a charter school,
11 university school for profoundly gifted pupils or public school who is likely to have
12 unsupervised contact with pupils to submit his or her fingerprints for the purpose of
13 a criminal background check before beginning his or her service as a volunteer and
14 at least once every 5 years thereafter. (NRS 388A.515, 388C.200, 391.104)
15 Existing law authorizes, under certain circumstances, the board of trustees of a
16 school district to exempt volunteers who are employed by a business, agency or
17 organization participating in a work-based learning program from the requirements
18 of submitting fingerprints for an investigation into the criminal background of the
19 volunteers. (NRS 391.1055) Section 2 of this bill provides instead that the board of
20 trustees may exempt any volunteer if the volunteer has passed an investigation into
21 his or her criminal background as a requirement for: (1) employment with the
22 business, agency or organization; or (2) obtaining a professional or occupational
23 license in this State. Section 2 further provides that the board of trustees may
24 authorize the volunteer to submit his or her fingerprints for an investigation into the
25 criminal background of the volunteer less often than every 5 years. Finally, section
26 2 authorizes the board of trustees, to the extent money is available, to reimburse a
27 business, agency or organization for the cost incurred by the business, agency or
28 organization for submitting fingerprints for the investigation into the criminal
29 background of the volunteer.
