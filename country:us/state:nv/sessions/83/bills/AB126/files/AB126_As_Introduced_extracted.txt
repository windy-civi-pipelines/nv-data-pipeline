FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to criminal justice; expanding certain prohibitions
relating to pornography involving minors; providing
penalties; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits a person from committing certain acts regarding
2 pornography involving minors. (NRS 200.700-200.760) In general, sections 2 and
3 3 of this bill expand these prohibitions to include pornography involving: (1)
4 images of minors that have been manipulated using artificial intelligence; and (2)
5 artificial intelligence-generated minors. Section 1 of this bill defines the term
6 “artificial intelligence-generated minor” for purposes of these prohibitions and
7 certain other provisions of existing law relating to pornography involving minors to
8 mean a fictional human that: (1) is generated through the use of artificial
9 intelligence; and (2) has anatomical or physical features that make the fictional
10 human appear to be a minor. Section 1 also defines certain other terms for the same
11 purpose.
12 Existing law provides that a person who knowingly prepares, advertises or
13 distributes any item or material that depicts a minor engaging in or simulating, or
14 assisting others to engage in or simulate, sexual conduct is guilty of a category B
15 felony. (NRS 200.725) Section 2 expands this prohibition to include any item or
16 material that contains or incorporates: (1) an image of a minor that has been
17 mechanically or digitally altered to depict the minor engaging in or simulating, or
18 assisting others to engage in or simulate, sexual conduct; or (2) an obscene
19 depiction of an artificial intelligence-generated minor engaging in or simulating, or
20 assisting others to engage in or simulate, certain sexual conduct.
21 Existing law provides that a person who knowingly and willfully has in his or
22 her possession any film, photograph or other visual representation depicting a
23 person under the age of 16 years as the subject of a sexual portrayal or engaging in,
24 simulating, or assisting others to engage in or simulate, sexual conduct is guilty of:
25 (1) a category B felony for the first offense; and (2) a category A felony for any
-

26 subsequent offense. (NRS 200.730) Section 3 expands this prohibition to include
27 any film, photograph or other visual presentation that contains or incorporates: (1)
28 an image of a minor that has been mechanically or digitally altered to depict the
29 minor engaging in or simulating, or assisting others to engage in or simulate, sexual
30 conduct; or (2) an obscene depiction of an artificial intelligence-generated minor as
31 the subject of a sexual portrayal or engaging in or simulating, or assisting others to
32 engage in or simulate, sexual conduct. Section 15 of this bill makes conforming
33 changes to refer to provisions that have been renumbered by section 3.
34 Existing law requires a person convicted of a sexual offense to register as a sex
35 offender and comply with certain other requirements. (NRS 179D.441, 179D.445,
36 179D.460) Existing law defines the term sexual offense for the purposes of these
37 requirements to include any offense involving pornography and a minor. (NRS
38 179D.097) Because sections 2 and 3 expand the applicability of offenses involving
39 pornography and a minor, section 21 has the effect of requiring a person convicted
40 of a violation of section 2 or 3 to: (1) register as a sex offender under certain
41 circumstances; and (2) comply with certain other requirements applicable to sex
42 offenders. Sections 4-14 and 16-25 of this bill make conforming changes to certain
43 provisions that refer to offenses involving pornography and a minor to make such
44 provisions also refer to certain offenses involving pornography and an artificial-
45 intelligence generated minor.

A.B. 126
ASSEMBLY BILL NO. 126–ASSEMBLYMEMBER HARDY
PREFILED JANUARY 28, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Judiciary
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to pornography involving
minors. (BDR 15-195)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to criminal justice; expanding certain prohibitions
relating to pornography involving minors; providing
penalties; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits a person from committing certain acts regarding
2 pornography involving minors. (NRS 200.700-200.760) In general, sections 2 and
3 3 of this bill expand these prohibitions to include pornography involving: (1)
4 images of minors that have been manipulated using artificial intelligence; and (2)
5 artificial intelligence-generated minors. Section 1 of this bill defines the term
6 “artificial intelligence-generated minor” for purposes of these prohibitions and
7 certain other provisions of existing law relating to pornography involving minors to
8 mean a fictional human that: (1) is generated through the use of artificial
9 intelligence; and (2) has anatomical or physical features that make the fictional
10 human appear to be a minor. Section 1 also defines certain other terms for the same
11 purpose.
12 Existing law provides that a person who knowingly prepares, advertises or
13 distributes any item or material that depicts a minor engaging in or simulating, or
14 assisting others to engage in or simulate, sexual conduct is guilty of a category B
15 felony. (NRS 200.725) Section 2 expands this prohibition to include any item or
16 material that contains or incorporates: (1) an image of a minor that has been
17 mechanically or digitally altered to depict the minor engaging in or simulating, or
18 assisting others to engage in or simulate, sexual conduct; or (2) an obscene
19 depiction of an artificial intelligence-generated minor engaging in or simulating, or
20 assisting others to engage in or simulate, certain sexual conduct.
21 Existing law provides that a person who knowingly and willfully has in his or
22 her possession any film, photograph or other visual representation depicting a
23 person under the age of 16 years as the subject of a sexual portrayal or engaging in,
24 simulating, or assisting others to engage in or simulate, sexual conduct is guilty of:
25 (1) a category B felony for the first offense; and (2) a category A felony for any
-
*AB126*

– 2 –
26 subsequent offense. (NRS 200.730) Section 3 expands this prohibition to include
27 any film, photograph or other visual presentation that contains or incorporates: (1)
28 an image of a minor that has been mechanically or digitally altered to depict the
29 minor engaging in or simulating, or assisting others to engage in or simulate, sexual
30 conduct; or (2) an obscene depiction of an artificial intelligence-generated minor as
31 the subject of a sexual portrayal or engaging in or simulating, or assisting others to
32 engage in or simulate, sexual conduct. Section 15 of this bill makes conforming
33 changes to refer to provisions that have been renumbered by section 3.
34 Existing law requires a person convicted of a sexual offense to register as a sex
35 offender and comply with certain other requirements. (NRS 179D.441, 179D.445,
36 179D.460) Existing law defines the term sexual offense for the purposes of these
37 requirements to include any offense involving pornography and a minor. (NRS
38 179D.097) Because sections 2 and 3 expand the applicability of offenses involving
39 pornography and a minor, section 21 has the effect of requiring a person convicted
40 of a violation of section 2 or 3 to: (1) register as a sex offender under certain
41 circumstances; and (2) comply with certain other requirements applicable to sex
42 offenders. Sections 4-14 and 16-25 of this bill make conforming changes to certain
43 provisions that refer to offenses involving pornography and a minor to make such
44 provisions also refer to certain offenses involving pornography and an artificial-
45 intelligence generated minor.
