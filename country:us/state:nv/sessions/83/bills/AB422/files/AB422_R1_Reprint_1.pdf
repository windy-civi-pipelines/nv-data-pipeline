AN ACT relating to the Civil Air Patrol; revising provisions relating
to the employment of a member of the Civil Air Patrol;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Federal law establishes the Civil Air Patrol as a federally chartered nonprofit
2 corporation and the volunteer civilian auxiliary of the United States Air Force. (10
3 U.S.C. §§ 9491, 9492, 36 U.S.C. §§ 40301 et seq.) Existing law establishes various
4 duties of the Nevada Wing of the Civil Air Patrol, including to carry out crash,
5 rescue and emergency operations, support federal, state and local law enforcement
6 agencies in homeland defense and narcotics interdiction missions and provide
7 related organization and training. (NRS 413.010) Section 1 of this bill provides that
8 an employee who is a volunteer member of the Nevada Wing of the Civil Air Patrol
9 is entitled to a leave of absence from his or her employment without loss of
10 position, seniority, accrued leave or benefits on days during which the employee is:
11 (1) engaged in training for emergency missions with the Civil Air Patrol, not to
12 exceed 10 workdays during each federal fiscal year; and (2) responding to an
13 emergency mission with the Civil Air Patrol, not to exceed 30 workdays during
14 each federal fiscal year. Section 1 defines “emergency mission” to include search
15 and rescue and disaster response activities. Section 1 prohibits an employer from
16 requiring an employee to exhaust any other leave to which the employee is entitled
17 before such leaves of absence and any such leave is authorized to be treated as
18 unpaid leave by an employer. Section 1 also requires the employee requesting the
19 leave to provide to his or her employer certain certifications and verifications
20 relating to the employee’s service with the Civil Air Patrol. Section 1 authorizes an
21 employee who is aggrieved by a violation of the provisions of section 1 to bring a
22 civil action to seek damages equal to the amount of the lost wages and benefits and
23 reasonable attorney’s fees and costs.
24 Existing law requires an employee to disclose to his or her employer if he or
25 she wishes to join a volunteer search and rescue or reserve unit of a sheriff’s

26 department or a Civil Air Patrol unit. Existing law also authorizes an employer to
27 prohibit the employee from participating in search and rescue activities during
28 normal working hours. (NRS 414.250) Section 2 of this bill eliminates the
29 authority of an employer to prohibit an employee who is entitled to a leave of
30 absence pursuant to section 1 from participating in activities related to the
31 employee’s membership in a Civil Air Patrol unit for which such leave is
32 authorized.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 413 of NRS is hereby amended by adding
2 thereto a new section to read as follows:
3 1. An employee who is a volunteer member of the Nevada
4 Wing of the Civil Air Patrol is entitled to a leave of absence from
5 his or her employment without loss of position, seniority, accrued
6 leave or benefits on all days during which the employee is:
7 (a) Engaged in training for emergency missions with the Civil
8 Air Patrol, not to exceed 10 workdays during each federal fiscal
9 year; or
10 (b) Responding to an emergency mission as a Civil Air Patrol
11 volunteer, not to exceed 30 workdays during each federal fiscal
12 year.
13 2. An employee requesting leave pursuant to this section shall
14 provide to his or her employer:
15 (a) Certification that the employee has been authorized by the
16 United States Air Force, the Governor or a political subdivision of
17 this State to respond to or train for an emergency mission; and
18 (b) Verification from the Civil Air Patrol of the emergency
19 need of the volunteer service of the employee.
20 3. An employer may treat a leave of absence pursuant to this
21 section as unpaid leave. An employer shall not require an
22 employee to exhaust any other leave to which the employee is
23 entitled before such a leave of absence pursuant to this section.
24 Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent an employer
25 from providing paid leave during such leaves of absence.
26 4. Any employee aggrieved by a violation of this section may
27 bring a civil action in a court of competent jurisdiction against
28 any person who commits the violation to seek any or all of the
29 following relief:
30 (a) Damages equal to the amount of the lost wages and
31 benefits; and
32 (b) Reasonable attorney’s fees and costs.

11 [search and rescue] the activities of such a reserve unit or Civil Air
12 Patrol unit during his or her normal working hours, the employer
13 shall notify the employee as soon as practicable after the disclosure
14 is made pursuant to subsection 1.
15 3. An applicant for employment who is a member of a search
16 and rescue or reserve unit of a sheriff’s department or a Civil Air
17 Patrol unit shall disclose that fact to his or her prospective employer.
