EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to the Civil Air Patrol; revising provisions relating
to the employment of a member of the Civil Air Patrol;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Federal law establishes the Civil Air Patrol as a federally chartered nonprofit
2 corporation and the volunteer civilian auxiliary of the United States Air Force. (10
3 U.S.C. §§ 9491, 9492, 36 U.S.C. §§ 40301 et seq.) Existing law establishes various
4 duties of the Nevada Wing of the Civil Air Patrol, including to carry out crash,
5 rescue and emergency operations, support federal, state and local law enforcement
6 agencies in homeland defense and narcotics interdiction missions and provide
7 related organization and training. (NRS 413.010) Section 1 of this bill provides that
8 an employee who is a volunteer member of the Nevada Wing of the Civil Air Patrol
9 is entitled to a leave of absence from his or her employment without loss of
10 position, seniority, accrued leave or benefits on days during which the employee is:
11 (1) engaged in training for emergency missions with the Civil Air Patrol, not to
12 exceed 10 workdays during each federal fiscal year; and (2) responding to an
13 emergency mission with the Civil Air Patrol, not to exceed 30 workdays during
14 each federal fiscal year. Section 1 prohibits an employer from requiring an
15 employee to exhaust any other leave to which the employee is entitled before such
16 leaves of absence and any such leave is authorized to be treated as unpaid leave by
17 an employer. Section 1 also requires the employee requesting the leave to provide
18 to his or her employer certain certifications and verifications relating to the
19 employee’s service with the Civil Air Patrol. Section 1 authorizes an employee
20 who is aggrieved by a violation of the provisions of section 1 to bring a civil action
21 to seek damages equal to the amount of the lost wages and benefits and reasonable
22 attorney’s fees and costs.
23 Existing law requires an employee to disclose to his or her employer if he or
24 she wishes to join a volunteer search and rescue or reserve unit of a sheriff’s
25 department or a Civil Air Patrol unit and authorizes an employer to prohibit the
26 employee from participating in search and rescue activities during normal working
27 hours. (NRS 414.250) Section 2 of this bill eliminates the authority of an employer
-

– 2 –
28 to prohibit an employee from participating in search and rescue activities related to
29 the employee’s membership in a Civil Air Patrol unit under certain circumstances.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 413 of NRS is hereby amended by adding
2 thereto a new section to read as follows:
3 1. An employee who is a volunteer member of the Nevada

8 Air Patrol, not to exceed 10 workdays during each federal fiscal
9 year; or

17 this State to respond to or train for an emergency mission; and
18 (b) Verification from the Civil Air Patrol of the emergency
19 need of the volunteer service of the employee.
20 3. An employer may treat a leave of absence pursuant to this
21 section as unpaid leave. An employer shall not require an
22 employee to exhaust any other leave to which the employee is
23 entitled before such a leave of absence pursuant to this section.
24 Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent an employer
25 from providing paid leave during such leaves of absence.

27 bring a civil action in a court of competent jurisdiction against
