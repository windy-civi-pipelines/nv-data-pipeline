SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to the Civil Air Patrol. (BDR 36-190)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to the Civil Air Patrol; revising provisions relating to the
employment of a member of the Civil Air Patrol; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Federal law establishes the Civil Air Patrol as a federally chartered nonprofit corporation
2 and the volunteer civilian auxiliary of the United States Air Force. (10 U.S.C. §§ 9491, 9492,
3 36 U.S.C. §§ 40301 et seq.) Existing law establishes various duties of the Nevada Wing of the
4 Civil Air Patrol, including to carry out crash, rescue and emergency operations, support
5 federal, state and local law enforcement agencies in homeland defense and narcotics
6 interdiction missions and provide related organization and training. (NRS 413.010) Section 1
7 of this bill provides that an employee who is a volunteer member of the Nevada Wing of the
8 Civil Air Patrol is entitled to a leave of absence from his or her employment without loss of
9 position, seniority, accrued leave or benefits on days during which the employee is: (1)
10 engaged in training for emergency missions with the Civil Air Patrol, not to exceed 10
11 workdays during each federal fiscal year; and (2) responding to an emergency mission with
12 the Civil Air Patrol, not to exceed 30 workdays during each federal fiscal year. Section 1
13 defines “emergency mission” to include search and rescue and disaster response
14 activities. Section 1 prohibits an employer from requiring an employee to exhaust any other
15 leave to which the employee is entitled before such leaves of absence and any such leave is
16 authorized to be treated as unpaid leave by an employer. Section 1 also requires the employee
17 requesting the leave to provide to his or her employer certain certifications and verifications
18 relating to the employee’s service with the Civil Air Patrol. Section 1 authorizes an employee
19 who is aggrieved by a violation of the provisions of section 1 to bring a civil action to seek
20 damages equal to the amount of the lost wages and benefits and reasonable attorney’s fees and
21 costs.
22 Existing law requires an employee to disclose to his or her employer if he or she wishes
23 to join a volunteer search and rescue or reserve unit of a sheriff’s department or a Civil Air
24 Patrol unit . [and] Existing law also authorizes an employer to prohibit the employee from
25 participating in search and rescue activities during normal working hours. (NRS 414.250)
26 Section 2 of this bill eliminates the authority of an employer to prohibit an employee who is
27 entitled to a leave of absence pursuant to section 1 from participating in [search and rescue]
28 activities related to the employee’s membership in a Civil Air Patrol unit [under certain
29 circumstances.] for which such leave is authorized.

24 action in a court of competent jurisdiction against any person who commits the
25 violation to seek any or all of the following relief:

43 4.] An applicant for employment who is a member of a search and rescue or
44 reserve unit of a sheriff’s department or a Civil Air Patrol unit shall disclose that
45 fact to his or her prospective employer.
