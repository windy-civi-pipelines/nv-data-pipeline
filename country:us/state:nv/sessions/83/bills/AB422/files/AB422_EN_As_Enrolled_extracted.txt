Section 1:
Yeager; and Kasama
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to the Civil Air Patrol; revising provisions relating
to the employment of a member of the Civil Air Patrol; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Federal law establishes the Civil Air Patrol as a federally chartered nonprofit
corporation and the volunteer civilian auxiliary of the United States Air Force. (10
U.S.C. §§ 9491, 9492, 36 U.S.C. §§ 40301 et seq.) Existing law establishes various
duties of the Nevada Wing of the Civil Air Patrol, including to carry out crash,
rescue and emergency operations, support federal, state and local law enforcement
agencies in homeland defense and narcotics interdiction missions and provide
related organization and training. (NRS 413.010) Section 1 of this bill provides that
an employee who is a volunteer member of the Nevada Wing of the Civil Air Patrol
is entitled to a leave of absence from his or her employment without loss of
position, seniority, accrued leave or benefits on days during which the employee is:
(1) engaged in training for emergency missions with the Civil Air Patrol, not to
exceed 10 workdays during each federal fiscal year; and (2) responding to an
emergency mission with the Civil Air Patrol, not to exceed 30 workdays during
each federal fiscal year. Section 1 defines “emergency mission” to include search
and rescue and disaster response activities. Section 1 prohibits an employer from
requiring an employee to exhaust any other leave to which the employee is entitled
before such leaves of absence and any such leave is authorized to be treated as
unpaid leave by an employer. Section 1 also requires the employee requesting the
leave to provide to his or her employer certain certifications and verifications
relating to the employee’s service with the Civil Air Patrol. Section 1 authorizes an
employee who is aggrieved by a violation of the provisions of section 1 to bring a
civil action to seek damages equal to the amount of the lost wages and benefits and
reasonable attorney’s fees and costs.
Existing law requires an employee to disclose to his or her employer if he or
she wishes to join a volunteer search and rescue or reserve unit of a sheriff’s
department or a Civil Air Patrol unit. Existing law also authorizes an employer to
prohibit the employee from participating in search and rescue activities during
normal working hours. (NRS 414.250) Section 2 of this bill eliminates the
authority of an employer to prohibit an employee who is entitled to a leave of
absence pursuant to section 1 from participating in activities related to the
employee’s membership in a Civil Air Patrol unit for which such leave is
authorized.
