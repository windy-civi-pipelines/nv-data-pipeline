EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to water; authorizing the State Engineer, in certain
areas of this State, to coordinate with persons who seek to
relinquish, by certain means, a right to appropriate water;
requiring the State Engineer to retire such relinquished
rights; revising provisions relating to the effective date of
a right to appropriate water under a permit; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth certain processes by which the State Engineer is
2 required or authorized to designate a basin for administration under certain
3 provisions of law concerning groundwater basins. (NRS 534.030) Existing law
4 further authorizes the State Engineer to make such rules, regulations and orders as
5 are deemed essential for the welfare of a groundwater basin or portion thereof that
6 has been designated by the State Engineer. (NRS 534.120)
7 Section 5 of this bill authorizes the State Engineer, in each area designated as a
8 groundwater basin by the State Engineer, to coordinate with persons who seek to
9 relinquish, by contract or other legal agreement, a right to appropriate water and
10 requires the State Engineer to retire any water right relinquished pursuant to such a
11 contract or agreement. Sections 1-3 of this bill prohibit the appropriation of water
12 for which rights have been retired pursuant to section 5.
13 Under existing law, any person who wishes to appropriate public waters, or to
14 change the place of diversion, manner of use or place of use of water already
15 appropriated, must apply to the State Engineer for a permit to do so. (NRS 533.325)
16 Existing law requires, if the State Engineer judges that the holder of any permit to
17 appropriate public water is not proceeding in good faith and with reasonable
18 diligence to perfect the appropriation, the State Engineer to cancel the permit and
19 authorizes the holder of such a cancelled permit to file a written petition with the
20 State Engineer requesting a review of the cancellation by the State Engineer at a
21 public hearing. Existing law: (1) authorizes, after receiving and considering
22 evidence, the State Engineer to affirm, modify or rescind the cancellation; and (2)
23 provides that if the State Engineer modifies or rescinds the cancellation of the
-

– 2 –
24 permit, the effective date of the appropriation under the permit is vacated and
25 replaced by the date of the filing of the written petition with the State Engineer.
26 (NRS 533.395) Section 4 of this bill provides that a permit which was cancelled for
27 a failure to timely file a document relating to the permit is not subject to provisions
28 concerning the vacation and replacement date of a permit which was previously
29 cancelled.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 533.030 is hereby amended to read as follows:

4 Sec. 2. NRS 533.370 is hereby amended to read as follows:
5 533.370 1. Except as otherwise provided in this section and
6 NRS 533.0241, 533.345, 533.371, 533.372 and 533.503, and
7 section 5 of this act, the State Engineer shall approve an application
8 submitted in proper form which contemplates the application of
9 water to beneficial use if:
10 (a) The application is accompanied by the prescribed fees;
11 (b) The proposed use or change, if within an irrigation district,
12 does not adversely affect the cost of water for other holders of water
13 rights in the district or lessen the efficiency of the district in its
14 delivery or use of water; and
15 (c) The applicant provides proof satisfactory to the State
16 Engineer of the applicant’s:
17 (1) Intention in good faith to construct any work necessary to
18 apply the water to the intended beneficial use with reasonable
19 diligence; and
20 (2) Financial ability and reasonable expectation actually to
21 construct the work and apply the water to the intended beneficial use
22 with reasonable diligence.
23 2. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 10, [where there]

25 the requested permit if:
26 (a) There is no unappropriated water in the proposed source of
27 supply [, where the] ;
28 (b) The groundwater that has not been committed for use has
29 been reserved pursuant to NRS 533.0241 ;
30 (c) The groundwater rights have been retired pursuant to

39 may be denied without publication.
40 3. In addition to the criteria set forth in subsections 1 and 2, in
41 determining whether an application for an interbasin transfer of
42 groundwater must be rejected pursuant to this section, the State
43 Engineer shall consider:
44 (a) Whether the applicant has justified the need to import the
45 water from another basin;
-
*SB342*

– 4 –

4 has been adopted and is being effectively carried out;
5 (c) Whether the proposed action is environmentally sound as it
6 relates to the basin from which the water is exported;
7 (d) Whether the proposed action is an appropriate long-term use

11 relevant.
12 4. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection and

38 subsection 10, the State Engineer shall approve or reject, within 6
39 months after the final date for filing a protest, an application filed to

45 contiguous to the place of use of the existing water right. The State
-

– 5 –
1 Engineer may postpone action on the application pursuant to
2 subsection 4.
3 7. If the State Engineer has not approved, rejected or held a
4 hearing on an application within 7 years after the final date for filing
5 a protest, the State Engineer shall cause notice of the application to
6 be republished and reposted pursuant to NRS 533.360 immediately
7 preceding the time at which the State Engineer is ready to approve
8 or reject the application. The cost of the republication must be paid
9 by the applicant. After such republication and reposting, a protest
10 may be filed in accordance with NRS 533.365.
11 8. If a hearing is held regarding an application, the decision of
12 the State Engineer must be in writing and include findings of fact,
13 conclusions of law and a statement of the underlying facts
14 supporting the findings of fact. The written decision may take the
15 form of a transcription of an oral ruling. The rejection or approval of
16 an application must be endorsed on a copy of the original
17 application, and a record must be made of the endorsement in the
18 records of the State Engineer. The copy of the application so
19 endorsed must be returned to the applicant. Except as otherwise

25 prosecution of the proposed work or the diversion and use of
26 the public water while the rejection continues in force.
27 9. If a person is the successor in interest of an owner of a water
28 right or an owner of real property upon which a domestic well is
29 located and if the former owner of the water right or real property on
30 which a domestic well is located had previously filed a written
31 protest against the granting of an application, the successor in
32 interest must be allowed to pursue that protest in the same manner
33 as if the successor in interest were the former owner whose interest
34 he or she succeeded. If the successor in interest wishes to pursue the
35 protest, the successor in interest must notify the State Engineer in a
36 timely manner on a form provided by the State Engineer.
37 10. The provisions of subsections 1 to 9, inclusive, do not

– 6 –
1 12. As used in this section, “domestic well” has the meaning
2 ascribed to it in NRS 534.350.
3 Sec. 3. NRS 533.371 is hereby amended to read as follows:
4 533.371 The State Engineer shall reject the application and
5 refuse to issue a permit to appropriate water for a specified period if
6 the State Engineer determines that:
7 1. The application is incomplete;
8 2. The prescribed fees have not been paid;
9 3. The proposed use is not temporary;
10 4. There is no water available from the proposed source of
11 supply without exceeding the perennial yield or safe yield of that
12 source;
13 5. The groundwater that has not been committed for use from
14 the proposed source of supply has been reserved pursuant to
15 NRS 533.0241;
16 6. The groundwater rights have been retired pursuant to
17 section 5 of this act;
18 7. The proposed use conflicts with existing rights; or
19 [7.] 8. The proposed use threatens to prove detrimental to the
20 public interest.
21 Sec. 4. NRS 533.395 is hereby amended to read as follows:
22 533.395 1. If, at any time in the judgment of the State
23 Engineer, the holder of any permit to appropriate the public water is
24 not proceeding in good faith and with reasonable diligence to
25 perfect the appropriation, the State Engineer shall require the
26 submission of such proof and evidence as may be necessary to show
27 a compliance with the law. If, in the judgment of the State Engineer,
28 the holder of a permit is not proceeding in good faith and with
29 reasonable diligence to perfect the appropriation, the State Engineer
30 shall cancel the permit, and advise the holder of its cancellation. The
31 failure to provide the proof and evidence required pursuant to this
32 subsection is prima facie evidence that the holder is not proceeding
33 in good faith and with reasonable diligence to perfect the
34 appropriation.
35 2. If any permit is cancelled under the provisions of this section
36 or NRS 533.390 or 533.410, the holder of the permit may within 60
37 days of the cancellation of the permit file a written petition with the
38 State Engineer requesting a review of the cancellation by the State
39 Engineer at a public hearing. The State Engineer may, after
40 receiving and considering evidence, affirm, modify or rescind the
41 cancellation.
42 3. If the decision of the State Engineer modifies or rescinds the
43 cancellation of a permit, the effective date of the appropriation
44 under the permit is vacated and replaced by the date of the filing of
45 the written petition with the State Engineer. The provisions of this
-
*SB342*

– 7 –
1 subsection do not apply to a permit which was cancelled for a
2 failure to timely file a document relating to the permit.
3 4. The cancellation of a permit may not be reviewed or be the
4 subject of any judicial proceedings unless a written petition for
5 review has been filed and the cancellation has been affirmed,
6 modified or rescinded pursuant to subsection 2.
7 5. For the purposes of this section, the measure of reasonable
8 diligence is the steady application of effort to perfect the
9 appropriation in a reasonably expedient and efficient manner under
10 all the facts and circumstances. When a project or integrated system
11 is comprised of several features, work on one feature of the project
12 or system may be considered in finding that reasonable diligence
13 has been shown in the development of water rights for all features of
14 the entire project or system.
15 6. The appropriation of water or the acquisition or lease of
16 appropriated water from any:
17 (a) Stream system as provided for in this chapter; or
18 (b) Underground water as provided for in NRS 534.080,
19  by a political subdivision of this State or a public utility, as
20 defined in NRS 704.020, to serve the present or the reasonably
21 anticipated future municipal, industrial or domestic needs of its
22 customers for water, as determined in accordance with a master plan
23 adopted pursuant to chapter 278 of NRS or a plan approved by the
24 State Engineer, must be considered when reviewing an extension of
25 time.
26 Sec. 5. Chapter 534 of NRS is hereby amended by adding
27 thereto a new section to read as follows:
28 In each area designated as a groundwater basin by the State
29 Engineer pursuant to the provisions of NRS 534.030, the State
30 Engineer may coordinate with persons who seek to relinquish, by
31 contract or other legal agreement, a right to appropriate water.
32 The State Engineer must retire any water right relinquished
33 pursuant to such a contract or other legal agreement.
