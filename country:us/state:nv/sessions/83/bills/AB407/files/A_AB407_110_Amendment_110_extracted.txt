8 certain documentation, parts and tools required for the diagnosis, maintenance or repair of the
9 [covered product;] equipment; and (2) sets forth the circumstances under which
10 documentation, parts and tools are made available on fair and reasonable terms . [; and (3)
11 provides that the requirements do not apply to an original equipment manufacturer who

13 product that is equivalent to or better than the covered product as a replacement for that
14 covered product. Section 6 of this bill defines “digital electronic equipment” to mean any
15 product in the form of hardware that: (1) is manufactured for the first time on or after January
16 1, 2026; (2) is first sold or used in this State on or after January 1, 2026; and (3) depends for

47 reasonably necessary to enable an independent repair provider or owner of [a covered
48 product] equipment to diagnose, maintain or repair [a covered product.
49 Section 29 of this bill provides that, except in a dispute arising between an original
50 equipment manufacturer and an authorized repair provider related to the compliance of either

59 Section 30 of this bill sets forth certain limitations on the construction of the provisions
60 of this bill. Section 31 of this bill exempts an original equipment manufacturer and authorized

64 repair provider.
65 [Section 32 of this bill sets forth certain provisions governing the enforcement of the
66 provisions of this bill by the Attorney General and provides for a civil penalty of not more
67 than $500 for each violation.]
68 Section 32.5 of this bill provides that a violation of the provisions of this bill
