3 equipment, which is defined by section 7.5 of this bill to mean a mobility device
4 designed for a person with a physical disability, including, without limitation, a
5 powered wheelchair, manual wheelchair, mobility scooter or power assist device
6 for a manual wheelchair, to make available to any independent repair provider or

8 and tools required for the diagnosis, maintenance or repair of the equipment; and
9 (2) sets forth the circumstances under which documentation, parts and tools are
10 made available on fair and reasonable terms. Section 3 of this bill defines
11 “authorized repair provider” to mean a person operating in this State who is not
12 affiliated with an original equipment manufacturer and who has an arrangement
13 with an original equipment manufacturer to use a proprietary identifier of the
14 original equipment manufacturer to offer the services of diagnosis, maintenance or
15 repair of the manufacturer’s equipment. Section 8 of this bill defines “independent
16 repair provider” to mean: (1) a person operating in this State who is engaged in the

19 provider; or (2) an original equipment manufacturer or an authorized repair
20 provider of such a manufacturer who engages in the services of diagnosis,
21 maintenance or repair of equipment that is not manufactured, sold or supplied by
22 the manufacturer.
23 Section 25 of this bill provides that an original equipment manufacturer is
24 considered an authorized repair provider if, in the regular course of business, the
25 original equipment manufacturer offers to an owner the services of diagnosis,
26 maintenance or repair of its own equipment.
27 Section 28 of this bill prohibits an original equipment manufacturer from: (1)
28 retaliating against an authorized repair provider for providing or selling, or
29 hindering the ability of an authorized repair provider to provide or sell,
30 documentation, parts or tools pursuant to the provisions of this bill; or (2)
31 conditioning or imposing an obligation or restriction that is not reasonably
32 necessary to enable an independent repair provider or owner of equipment to
33 diagnose, maintain or repair equipment. Section 28 also prohibits an original
34 equipment manufacturer from using certain mechanisms to: (1) prevent an
35 independent repair provider or an owner from installing or enabling the function of
36 an otherwise functional replacement part or component of equipment; (2) reduce
