hemp products to display [a sign] signs containing certain information;

2 the imposition of civil and criminal penalties against persons who engage in deceptive trade
3 practices. (Chapter 598 of NRS) This bill requires a person who does not hold a cannabis
4 establishment license and who sells or offers to sell a hemp product which is intended for
5 human consumption to display at all times at the location at which the sale or offer is made [a
6 sign] certain signs notifying customers that the [person does not hold a cannabis
7 establishment license and the] location is not [the premises of a] licensed to sell cannabis
8 [establishment.] and that all hemp products contain less than the legal limit of THC. This
9 bill additionally prohibits such a person from advertising or permitting to be advertised in any
10 manner any false, misleading or deceptive statement or representation with regard to: (1)
11 whether the person holds a cannabis establishment license or the location at which the sale or
12 offer is made is the premises of a cannabis establishment; or (2) the nature of any hemp
13 product which is intended for human consumption that is sold or offered for sale by the
14 person. Under this bill, any violation of the requirements or prohibitions set forth in this bill
