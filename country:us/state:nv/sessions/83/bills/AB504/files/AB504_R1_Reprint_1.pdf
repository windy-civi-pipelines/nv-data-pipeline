AN ACT relating to deceptive trade practices; requiring a person

3 engage in deceptive trade practices. (Chapter 598 of NRS) This bill requires a
4 person who does not hold a cannabis establishment license and who sells or offers
5 to sell a hemp product which is intended for human consumption to display at all
6 times at the location at which the sale or offer is made certain signs notifying
7 customers that the location is not licensed to sell cannabis and that all hemp
8 products contain less than the legal limit of THC. This bill additionally prohibits
9 such a person from advertising or permitting to be advertised in any manner any
10 false, misleading or deceptive statement or representation with regard to: (1)
11 whether the person holds a cannabis establishment license or the location at which
12 the sale or offer is made is the premises of a cannabis establishment; or (2) the
13 nature of any hemp product which is intended for human consumption that is sold
14 or offered for sale by the person. Under this bill, any violation of the requirements
15 or prohibitions set forth in this bill constitutes a deceptive trade practice.
