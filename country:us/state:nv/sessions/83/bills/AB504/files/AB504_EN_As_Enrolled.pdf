CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to deceptive trade practices; requiring a person
who does not hold a cannabis establishment license and who
sells or offers to sell certain hemp products to display signs
containing certain information; prohibiting such a person
from making certain false, misleading or deceptive
statements in advertising; making it a deceptive trade practice
to violate those requirements or prohibitions; authorizing the

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law defines activities that constitute deceptive trade practices and
provides for the imposition of civil and criminal penalties against persons who
engage in deceptive trade practices. (Chapter 598 of NRS) Section 1 of this bill
requires a person who does not hold a cannabis establishment license and who sells
or offers to sell a hemp product which is intended for human consumption to
display at all times at the location at which the sale or offer is made certain signs
notifying customers that the location is not licensed to sell cannabis and that all
hemp products contain less than the legal limit of THC. Section 1 additionally
prohibits such a person from advertising or permitting to be advertised in any
manner any false, misleading or deceptive statement or representation with regard
to: (1) whether the person holds a cannabis establishment license or the location at
which the sale or offer is made is the premises of a cannabis establishment; or (2)
the nature of any hemp product which is intended for human consumption that is
sold or offered for sale by the person. Under section 1, any violation of the
requirements or prohibitions set forth in this bill constitutes a deceptive trade
practice.
Section 2 of this bill grants the Cannabis Compliance Board the power to
investigate and refer violations of section 1 to the Attorney General for the
imposition of any applicable civil and criminal penalties.
