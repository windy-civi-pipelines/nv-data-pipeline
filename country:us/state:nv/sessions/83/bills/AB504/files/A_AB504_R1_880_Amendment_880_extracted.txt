3 practices. (Chapter 598 of NRS) [This] Section 1 of this bill requires a person who does not
4 hold a cannabis establishment license and who sells or offers to sell a hemp product which is

6 offer is made certain signs notifying customers that the location is not licensed to sell cannabis
7 and that all hemp products contain less than the legal limit of THC. [This bill] Section 1
8 additionally prohibits such a person from advertising or permitting to be advertised in any
9 manner any false, misleading or deceptive statement or representation with regard to: (1)
10 whether the person holds a cannabis establishment license or the location at which the sale or
11 offer is made is the premises of a cannabis establishment; or (2) the nature of any hemp
12 product which is intended for human consumption that is sold or offered for sale by the
13 person. Under [this bill,] section 1, any violation of the requirements or prohibitions set forth
14 in this bill constitutes a deceptive trade practice.
