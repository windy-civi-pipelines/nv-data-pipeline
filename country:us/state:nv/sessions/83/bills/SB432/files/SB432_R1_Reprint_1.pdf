EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to privacy; granting courts discretion to close
family law proceedings under certain circumstances;
revising provisions concerning the accessibility of court
records in family law proceedings; repealing an
unconstitutional provision relating to the closure of
certain divorce proceedings; prohibiting the public
posting or display of the personal identifying information
of another person under certain circumstances; providing
penalties; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the court in any action for divorce to close a proceeding
2 upon the demand of either party to the action. (NRS 125.080) In 2024, the Nevada
3 Supreme Court held that such a statute is unconstitutional because it permits closed
4 court proceedings without the exercise of judicial discretion. (Falconi v. Eighth
5 Judicial District Court in and for the County of Clark, 140 Nev. Adv. Op. 8, 543
6 P.3d 92 (2024)) Section 6 of this bill repeals this statute. Section 2 of this bill
7 defines the term “family law proceeding” to mean a proceeding conducted pursuant
8 to the provisions of Title 11 of NRS. Section 3 of this bill: (1) establishes that
9 family law proceedings are presumptively open unless an exception applies; and (2)
10 authorizes a court to exercise its discretion and close any such proceeding if the
11 court determines that closure is necessary to serve a compelling interest. Section 3
12 also requires the court to: (1) consider certain factors when making this
13 determination; and (2) exclude certain persons from the court or chambers if the
14 proceeding is closed. Additionally, section 3 provides that an electronic or video
15 record of a private hearing: (1) is confidential and not open to public inspection,
16 except by the parties, their counsel and necessary staff or experts, unless an
17 exception applies; and (2) must not be distributed, copied or made publicly
18 available.

19 Section 4 of this bill governs which court records are accessible to the public in
20 family law proceedings. Under section 4, a court is authorized to seal or redact
21 certain court records if the court determines that the sealing or redaction is justified
22 by a compelling interest that outweighs the public interest in access to the court
23 record. Section 4 also: (1) authorizes the court to unseal a court record under
24 certain circumstances; and (2) requires the court to consider certain factors in
25 determining whether to unseal a court record. Section 6 repeals an existing statute
26 governing which court records are accessible to the public in a divorce action,
27 which is being replaced by the provisions of section 4.
28 Section 5 of this bill prohibits a person from willfully and intentionally posting
29 or displaying in any public manner certain personal identifying information of
30 another person without the consent of the person. Section 5 provides that a person
31 who commits such an unlawful act is guilty of a category D felony.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Title 11 of NRS is hereby amended by adding
2 thereto a new chapter to consist of the provisions set forth as
3 sections 2, 3 and 4 of this act.
4 Sec. 2. As used in this chapter, “family law proceeding”
5 means a proceeding conducted pursuant to the provisions of this
6 title.
7 Sec. 3. 1. Except as otherwise provided by specific statute
8 or court rule, family law proceedings are presumptively open.
9 2. Upon oral or written motion of either party, upon its own
10 motion or upon the filing of a request to provide electronic
11 coverage of a proceeding, a court may exercise its discretion and
12 close a proceeding if the court determines that closure is necessary
13 to serve a compelling interest.
14 3. In addition to any other factors the court considers
15 relevant in determining whether closure serves a compelling
16 interest, the court shall consider:
17 (a) The best interests of each child involved in the proceeding;
18 (b) Whether permitting a third party to observe or record the
19 proceeding creates a substantial risk of violating a federal or state
20 law or regulation or court rule relating to the disclosure of
21 personal identifying information, including, without limitation:
22 (1) Individually identifiable health information as defined
23 in 45 C.F.R. § 160.103; or
24 (2) Educational records under the Family Educational
25 Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, 20 U.S.C. § 1232g, and any
26 regulations adopted pursuant thereto; and
27 (c) Whether, in the absence of closure, there is a substantial
28 risk that:
29 (1) A party to the proceeding or child involved in the
30 proceeding may suffer harassment, indignity, embarrassment,
-
*SB432_R1*

– 3 –
1 shame, financial loss, stigmatization, harm to reputation, anxiety,
2 fear or any other physical or emotional harm; or
3 (2) The fundamental right of privacy of any person will be
4 violated.
5 4. In addition to any other factors the court considers
6 relevant in determining whether closure is necessary to serve a
7 compelling interest, the court shall consider:
8 (a) Whether there is a substantial probability that, in the
9 absence of closure, the compelling interest could be harmed; and
10 (b) Whether there are alternatives to closure that would
11 adequately protect the compelling interest.
12 5. If the court determines that a proceeding should be closed
13 pursuant to subsection 2:
14 (a) The court shall direct that the proceeding be private; and
15 (b) Except as otherwise provided in subsections 6 and 7, all
16 persons must be excluded from the court or chambers wherein the
17 action is tried, except:
18 (1) The officers of the court;
19 (2) The parties;
20 (3) The counsel for the parties and any staff of such
21 counsel;
22 (4) The witnesses for the parties, including, without
23 limitation, expert witnesses;
24 (5) The parents or guardians of the parties; and
25 (6) The siblings of the parties.
26 6. The court may, upon oral or written motion of either party
27 or on its own motion, exclude the parents, guardians or siblings of
28 either party, or witnesses for either party, from the court or
29 chambers wherein the action is tried.
30 7. If the court determines that the interests of justice or best
31 interests of a child would be served, the court may permit a person
32 to remain, observe and hear any relevant portion of a proceeding,
33 notwithstanding any request by a party that the proceeding be
34 private.
35 8. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection or by
36 specific statute, court rule or court order, an electronic or video
37 record of a private hearing is confidential and not open to
38 inspection by any person. The parties, the counsel for the parties
39 and such staff and experts as the counsel for the parties deem
40 necessary may retain, view and copy an electronic or video record
41 of a private proceeding solely for purposes related to the
42 representation.
43 9. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 8 or by specific
44 statute, court rule or court order, a person shall not distribute,
45 copy or facilitate the distribution or copying of an electronic or
-
*SB432_R1*

– 4 –
1 video record of a private hearing. A person who violates this
2 subsection shall, upon receiving notice of the violation:
3 (a) Cease and desist from the conduct; and
4 (b) Immediately remove the electronic or video record from
5 public access.
6 10. As used in this section, the term “electronic coverage”
7 includes broadcasting, televising, recording and photographing.
8 Sec. 4. 1. In a family law proceeding:
9 (a) The following court records must be open to public
10 inspection in the clerk’s office:
11 (1) The summons and proof of service;
12 (2) If service is made by publication, the affidavit for
13 publication;
14 (3) The pleadings;
15 (4) Any decree or other order, including, without limitation,
16 an order directing the publication of a summons; and
17 (5) Any judgment, including, without limitation, a
18 judgment of default.
19 (b) The following court records are not open to public
20 inspection except by order of the court for good cause shown:
21 (1) Financial disclosure forms;
22 (2) Documents, records or evidence filed under seal;
23 (3) Documents sealed by a court pursuant to subsection 3;
24 (4) Confidential exhibits;
25 (5) Child custody evaluations;
26 (6) Medical records, including, without limitation, any
27 medical, psychiatric or psychological evaluation or report; and
28 (7) Any documents, the copying or distribution of which is
29 prohibited by federal or state law or regulation or court rule.
30 2. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 8 of section 3 of
31 this act, all other court records, including, without limitation,
32 exhibits and transcripts of testimony, are presumptively open to
33 public inspection.
34 3. The court may, on its own motion or at the request of a
35 party, seal or redact a court record described in subsection 2 if the
36 court determines that the sealing or redaction is justified by a
37 compelling interest that outweighs the public interest in access to
38 the court record. For the purpose of this subsection, protecting
39 personal identifying information concerning a party or child
40 involved in the proceeding from disclosure shall be deemed to be a
41 compelling interest that outweighs the public interest in access to
42 the court record.
43 4. The court may unseal a court record sealed pursuant to
44 subsection 3:
45 (a) Upon written stipulation of all parties;
-
*SB432_R1*

– 5 –
1 (b) Upon its own motion for good cause shown; or
2 (c) Upon the motion of a party for good cause shown. A copy
3 of any such motion must be served upon all parties to the
4 proceeding.
5 5. In addition to any other factors the court considers
6 relevant in determining whether good cause exists for unsealing a
7 court record pursuant to subsection 4, the court shall consider:
8 (a) Whether the court record contains information made
9 confidential by federal or state law or regulation or court rule;
10 (b) Whether federal or state law or regulation or court rule
11 provides that any information in the court record is not a public
12 record;
13 (c) Whether the party seeking to unseal the record has
14 demonstrated a legitimate interest in unsealing the record for a
15 purpose related to the representation;
16 (d) Whether unsealing the record would gratify private spite or
17 promote public scandal; and
18 (e) Whether unsealing the record would create a substantial
19 risk that a party to the proceeding or child involved in the
20 proceeding may suffer harassment, indignity, embarrassment,
21 shame, financial loss, stigmatization, harm to reputation, anxiety,
22 fear or any other physical or emotional harm.
23 6. As used in this section, “court record” includes, without
24 limitation, any document, information or exhibit maintained by a
25 court in connection with a family law proceeding.
26 Sec. 5. Chapter 205 of NRS is hereby amended by adding
27 thereto a new section to read as follows:
28 1. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a person shall
29 not willfully and intentionally post or display in any public
30 manner the personal identifying information of another person
31 without the consent of the person if the information is required to
32 be kept private pursuant to federal or state law or regulation or
33 court rule.
34 2. Unless a greater penalty is provided by specific statute, a
35 person who violates this section is guilty of a category D felony
36 and shall be punished as provided in NRS 193.130.

38 (a) “Personal identifying information” has the meaning
39 ascribed to it in NRS 205.4617.

41 communicate or otherwise make available to the general public.
42 Sec. 6. NRS 125.080 and 125.110 are hereby repealed.
