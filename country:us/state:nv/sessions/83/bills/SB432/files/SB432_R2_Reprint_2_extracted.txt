SECOND REPRINT S.B. 432
SENATE BILL NO. 432–COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY
MARCH 24, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Judiciary
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to privacy.
(BDR 11-1020)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to privacy; granting courts discretion to close
family law proceedings or portions thereof under certain
circumstances; revising provisions concerning the
accessibility of court records in family law proceedings;
repealing an unconstitutional provision relating to the
closure of certain divorce proceedings; prohibiting the
public posting or display of the personal identifying
information of another person under certain
circumstances; providing penalties; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the court in any action for divorce to close a proceeding
2 upon the demand of either party to the action. (NRS 125.080) In 2024, the Nevada
3 Supreme Court held that such a statute is unconstitutional because it permits closed
4 court proceedings without the exercise of judicial discretion. (Falconi v. Eighth
5 Judicial District Court in and for the County of Clark, 140 Nev. Adv. Op. 8, 543
6 P.3d 92 (2024)) Section 6 of this bill repeals this statute. Section 2 of this bill
7 defines the term “family law proceeding” to mean a proceeding conducted pursuant
8 to the provisions of Title 11 of NRS. Section 3 of this bill: (1) establishes that
9 family law proceedings are presumptively open unless an exception applies; and (2)
10 authorizes a court to exercise its discretion and close any such proceeding or
11 portion thereof if the court determines that closure is necessary to serve a
12 compelling interest. Section 3 also requires the court to: (1) consider certain factors
13 when making this determination; (2) make certain written findings; and (3) exclude
14 certain persons from the court or chambers if the proceeding is closed.
15 Additionally, section 3 provides, with certain exceptions, that a transcript, audio
16 recording or electronic or video record of a closed portion of a hearing or trial: (1)
17 is confidential and not open to inspection or copying, except by the parties, their
18 counsel and necessary staff or experts; and (2) must not be distributed.

19 Section 4 of this bill governs which court records are accessible to the public in
20 family law proceedings. Under section 4, a court is authorized to seal or redact
21 certain court records if the court determines that the sealing or redaction is justified
22 by a compelling interest that outweighs the public interest in access to the court
23 record. Section 4 also: (1) authorizes the court to unseal a court record under
24 certain circumstances; and (2) requires the court to consider certain factors in
25 determining whether to unseal a court record. Section 6 repeals an existing statute
26 governing which court records are accessible to the public in a divorce action,
27 which is being replaced by the provisions of section 4.
28 Section 5 of this bill prohibits a person from willfully and intentionally posting
29 or displaying in any public manner certain personal identifying information of
30 another person without the consent of the person. Section 5 provides that a person
31 who commits such an unlawful act is guilty of a category D felony.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Title 11 of NRS is hereby amended by adding
2 thereto a new chapter to consist of the provisions set forth as
3 sections 2, 3 and 4 of this act.
4 Sec. 2. As used in this chapter, “family law proceeding”
5 means a proceeding conducted pursuant to the provisions of this
6 title.
7 Sec. 3. 1. Except as otherwise provided by specific statute
8 or court rule, family law proceedings are presumptively open.
9 2. Upon oral or written motion of either party, upon its own
10 motion or upon the filing of a request to provide electronic
11 coverage of a proceeding, a court may exercise its discretion and
12 close a proceeding or portion thereof only if the court determines
13 that closure is necessary to serve a compelling interest.
14 3. In addition to any other factors the court considers
15 relevant in determining whether closure serves a compelling
16 interest, the court shall consider:
17 (a) The presumption set forth in subsection 1;
18 (b) The best interest of each child involved in the proceeding;
19 (c) Whether permitting a third party to observe or record the
20 proceeding creates a substantial risk of violating a federal or state
21 law or regulation or court rule relating to the disclosure of
22 personal identifying information that cannot be mitigated by
23 sealing court records. As used in this paragraph, “personal
24 identifying information” includes, without limitation:
25 (1) Individually identifiable health information as defined
26 in 45 C.F.R. § 160.103; or

– 3 –
1 (d) Whether, in the absence of closure, there is a substantial
2 risk that:
3 (1) A party to the proceeding or child involved in the
4 proceeding may suffer harassment, indignity, undue
5 embarrassment or any other physical or emotional harm; or
6 (2) The fundamental right of privacy of any person will be
7 violated.
8 4. After considering the factors set forth in subsection 3 and
9 any other factors the court considers relevant in determining
10 whether closure is necessary to serve a compelling interest, the
11 court shall make written findings regarding:
12 (a) Whether there is a substantial probability that, in the
13 absence of closure, the compelling interest will be harmed;
14 (b) Whether there are alternatives to closure that would
15 adequately protect the compelling interest; and
16 (c) Whether the closure is narrowly tailored to protect the
17 compelling interest.
18 5. If the court determines that a proceeding or portion thereof
19 should be closed pursuant to subsection 2:
20 (a) The court shall direct that the proceeding or portion
21 thereof be closed; and
22 (b) Except as otherwise provided in subsections 6 and 7, all
23 persons must be excluded from the court or chambers wherein the
24 action is tried, except:
25 (1) The officers of the court;
26 (2) The parties;
27 (3) The counsel for the parties and any staff of such
28 counsel;
29 (4) The witnesses for the parties, including, without

33 consanguinity to the parties.
34 6. The court may, upon oral or written motion of either party
35 or on its own motion, exclude any person described in
36 subparagraph (4), (5) or (6) of paragraph (b) of subsection 5 from
37 the court or chambers wherein the action is tried.
38 7. If the court determines that the interests of justice or best
39 interests of a child would be served, the court may permit a person
40 to remain, observe and hear any relevant portion of a proceeding,
41 notwithstanding any request by a party that the proceeding be
42 closed.
43 8. Except as otherwise provided by specific statute, court rule
44 or court order, a transcript, audio recording or electronic or video
45 record of a closed portion of a hearing or trial is confidential and
-
*SB432_R2*
– 4 –
1 not open to inspection or copying by persons except the parties, the
2 counsel for the parties and such staff and experts as the counsel
3 for the parties deem necessary.
4 9. A person with such access shall not distribute or facilitate
5 the distribution of a transcript, audio recording or electronic or
6 video record of any closed portion of a hearing or trial, except as
7 otherwise provided by specific statute, court rule or court order. A
8 person who violates this subsection shall, upon receiving notice of
9 the violation:
10 (a) Cease and desist from the conduct; and
11 (b) Immediately remove the transcript, audio recording or
12 electronic or video record from public access.
13 10. As used in this section, the term “electronic coverage”
14 includes broadcasting, televising, recording and photographing.
15 Sec. 4. 1. In a family law proceeding:
16 (a) The following court records must be open to public
17 inspection in the clerk’s office:

30 (3) Documents sealed by a court pursuant to subsection 3;
31 (4) Confidential exhibits;

37 2. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 8 of section 3 of
38 this act, all other court records, including, without limitation,
39 exhibits and transcripts of testimony, are presumptively open to
40 public inspection.
41 3. The court may, on its own motion or at the request of a
42 party, seal or redact a court record described in subsection 2 if the
43 court determines that the sealing or redaction is justified by a
44 compelling interest that outweighs the public interest in access to
45 the court record. For the purpose of this subsection, protecting
-
*SB432_R2*
– 5 –
1 personal identifying information concerning a party or child
2 involved in the proceeding from disclosure shall be deemed to be a
3 compelling interest that outweighs the public interest in access to
4 the court record.

6 subsection 3:
7 (a) Upon written stipulation of all parties;
8 (b) Upon its own motion for good cause shown; or

12 5. In addition to any other factors the court considers
13 relevant in determining whether good cause exists for unsealing a
14 court record pursuant to subsection 4, the court shall consider:
15 (a) Whether the court record contains information made
16 confidential by federal or state law or regulation or court rule;
17 (b) Whether federal or state law or regulation or court rule
18 provides that any information in the court record is not a public
19 record;
20 (c) The interests of the party seeking to unseal the record; and
21 (d) Whether unsealing the record would create a substantial
22 risk that a party to the proceeding or child involved in the
23 proceeding may suffer harassment, indignity, undue
24 embarrassment or any other physical or emotional harm.
25 6. As used in this section, “court record” includes, without
26 limitation, any document, information or exhibit maintained by a
27 court in connection with a family law proceeding.

30 1. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a person shall
31 not willfully and intentionally post or display in any public
32 manner the personal identifying information of another person
33 without the consent of the person if the information is required to
34 be kept private pursuant to federal or state law or regulation or
35 court rule.

(Reprinted with amendments adopted on May 27, 2025)
SECOND REPRINT S.B. 432
SENATE BILL NO. 432–COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY
MARCH 24, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Judiciary
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to privacy.
(BDR 11-1020)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to privacy; granting courts discretion to close
family law proceedings or portions thereof under certain
circumstances; revising provisions concerning the
accessibility of court records in family law proceedings;
repealing an unconstitutional provision relating to the
closure of certain divorce proceedings; prohibiting the
public posting or display of the personal identifying
information of another person under certain
circumstances; providing penalties; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the court in any action for divorce to close a proceeding
2 upon the demand of either party to the action. (NRS 125.080) In 2024, the Nevada
3 Supreme Court held that such a statute is unconstitutional because it permits closed
4 court proceedings without the exercise of judicial discretion. (Falconi v. Eighth
5 Judicial District Court in and for the County of Clark, 140 Nev. Adv. Op. 8, 543
6 P.3d 92 (2024)) Section 6 of this bill repeals this statute. Section 2 of this bill
7 defines the term “family law proceeding” to mean a proceeding conducted pursuant
8 to the provisions of Title 11 of NRS. Section 3 of this bill: (1) establishes that
9 family law proceedings are presumptively open unless an exception applies; and (2)
10 authorizes a court to exercise its discretion and close any such proceeding or
11 portion thereof if the court determines that closure is necessary to serve a
12 compelling interest. Section 3 also requires the court to: (1) consider certain factors
13 when making this determination; (2) make certain written findings; and (3) exclude
14 certain persons from the court or chambers if the proceeding is closed.
15 Additionally, section 3 provides, with certain exceptions, that a transcript, audio
16 recording or electronic or video record of a closed portion of a hearing or trial: (1)
17 is confidential and not open to inspection or copying, except by the parties, their
18 counsel and necessary staff or experts; and (2) must not be distributed.
-
*SB432_R2*

– 2 –
19 Section 4 of this bill governs which court records are accessible to the public in
20 family law proceedings. Under section 4, a court is authorized to seal or redact
21 certain court records if the court determines that the sealing or redaction is justified
22 by a compelling interest that outweighs the public interest in access to the court
23 record. Section 4 also: (1) authorizes the court to unseal a court record under
24 certain circumstances; and (2) requires the court to consider certain factors in
25 determining whether to unseal a court record. Section 6 repeals an existing statute
26 governing which court records are accessible to the public in a divorce action,
27 which is being replaced by the provisions of section 4.
28 Section 5 of this bill prohibits a person from willfully and intentionally posting
29 or displaying in any public manner certain personal identifying information of
30 another person without the consent of the person. Section 5 provides that a person
31 who commits such an unlawful act is guilty of a category D felony.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Title 11 of NRS is hereby amended by adding
2 thereto a new chapter to consist of the provisions set forth as
3 sections 2, 3 and 4 of this act.
4 Sec. 2. As used in this chapter, “family law proceeding”
5 means a proceeding conducted pursuant to the provisions of this
6 title.
7 Sec. 3. 1. Except as otherwise provided by specific statute
8 or court rule, family law proceedings are presumptively open.
9 2. Upon oral or written motion of either party, upon its own
10 motion or upon the filing of a request to provide electronic
11 coverage of a proceeding, a court may exercise its discretion and
12 close a proceeding or portion thereof only if the court determines
13 that closure is necessary to serve a compelling interest.
14 3. In addition to any other factors the court considers
15 relevant in determining whether closure serves a compelling
16 interest, the court shall consider:
17 (a) The presumption set forth in subsection 1;
18 (b) The best interest of each child involved in the proceeding;
19 (c) Whether permitting a third party to observe or record the
20 proceeding creates a substantial risk of violating a federal or state
21 law or regulation or court rule relating to the disclosure of
22 personal identifying information that cannot be mitigated by
23 sealing court records. As used in this paragraph, “personal
24 identifying information” includes, without limitation:
25 (1) Individually identifiable health information as defined
26 in 45 C.F.R. § 160.103; or
27 (2) Educational records under the Family Educational

*SB432_R2*

– 3 –
1 (d) Whether, in the absence of closure, there is a substantial
2 risk that:
3 (1) A party to the proceeding or child involved in the
4 proceeding may suffer harassment, indignity, undue
5 embarrassment or any other physical or emotional harm; or
6 (2) The fundamental right of privacy of any person will be
7 violated.
8 4. After considering the factors set forth in subsection 3 and
9 any other factors the court considers relevant in determining
10 whether closure is necessary to serve a compelling interest, the
11 court shall make written findings regarding:
12 (a) Whether there is a substantial probability that, in the
13 absence of closure, the compelling interest will be harmed;
14 (b) Whether there are alternatives to closure that would
15 adequately protect the compelling interest; and
16 (c) Whether the closure is narrowly tailored to protect the
17 compelling interest.
18 5. If the court determines that a proceeding or portion thereof
19 should be closed pursuant to subsection 2:
20 (a) The court shall direct that the proceeding or portion
21 thereof be closed; and
22 (b) Except as otherwise provided in subsections 6 and 7, all
23 persons must be excluded from the court or chambers wherein the
24 action is tried, except:
25 (1) The officers of the court;
26 (2) The parties;
27 (3) The counsel for the parties and any staff of such
28 counsel;
29 (4) The witnesses for the parties, including, without
30 limitation, expert witnesses;
31 (5) The guardians of the parties; and
32 (6) Persons who are related within the third degree of
33 consanguinity to the parties.
34 6. The court may, upon oral or written motion of either party
35 or on its own motion, exclude any person described in
36 subparagraph (4), (5) or (6) of paragraph (b) of subsection 5 from
37 the court or chambers wherein the action is tried.
38 7. If the court determines that the interests of justice or best
39 interests of a child would be served, the court may permit a person
40 to remain, observe and hear any relevant portion of a proceeding,
41 notwithstanding any request by a party that the proceeding be
42 closed.
43 8. Except as otherwise provided by specific statute, court rule
44 or court order, a transcript, audio recording or electronic or video
45 record of a closed portion of a hearing or trial is confidential and
-
*SB432_R2*

– 4 –
1 not open to inspection or copying by persons except the parties, the
2 counsel for the parties and such staff and experts as the counsel
3 for the parties deem necessary.
4 9. A person with such access shall not distribute or facilitate
5 the distribution of a transcript, audio recording or electronic or
6 video record of any closed portion of a hearing or trial, except as
7 otherwise provided by specific statute, court rule or court order. A
8 person who violates this subsection shall, upon receiving notice of
9 the violation:
10 (a) Cease and desist from the conduct; and
11 (b) Immediately remove the transcript, audio recording or
12 electronic or video record from public access.
13 10. As used in this section, the term “electronic coverage”
14 includes broadcasting, televising, recording and photographing.
15 Sec. 4. 1. In a family law proceeding:
16 (a) The following court records must be open to public
17 inspection in the clerk’s office:
18 (1) The summons and proof of service;
19 (2) If service is made by publication, the affidavit for
20 publication;
21 (3) The pleadings;
22 (4) Any decree or other order, including, without limitation,
23 an order directing the publication of a summons; and
24 (5) Any judgment, including, without limitation, a
25 judgment of default.
26 (b) The following court records are not open to public
27 inspection except by order of the court for good cause shown:

31 (4) Confidential exhibits;
32 (5) Child custody evaluations;
33 (6) Medical records, including, without limitation, any

38 this act, all other court records, including, without limitation,
39 exhibits and transcripts of testimony, are presumptively open to
40 public inspection.
41 3. The court may, on its own motion or at the request of a
42 party, seal or redact a court record described in subsection 2 if the
43 court determines that the sealing or redaction is justified by a
44 compelling interest that outweighs the public interest in access to
45 the court record. For the purpose of this subsection, protecting
-
*SB432_R2*

– 5 –
1 personal identifying information concerning a party or child
2 involved in the proceeding from disclosure shall be deemed to be a
3 compelling interest that outweighs the public interest in access to
4 the court record.
5 4. The court may unseal a court record sealed pursuant to
6 subsection 3:
7 (a) Upon written stipulation of all parties;
8 (b) Upon its own motion for good cause shown; or

16 confidential by federal or state law or regulation or court rule;
17 (b) Whether federal or state law or regulation or court rule
18 provides that any information in the court record is not a public
19 record;
20 (c) The interests of the party seeking to unseal the record; and
21 (d) Whether unsealing the record would create a substantial
22 risk that a party to the proceeding or child involved in the
23 proceeding may suffer harassment, indignity, undue
24 embarrassment or any other physical or emotional harm.
25 6. As used in this section, “court record” includes, without
26 limitation, any document, information or exhibit maintained by a
27 court in connection with a family law proceeding.
28 Sec. 5. Chapter 205 of NRS is hereby amended by adding
29 thereto a new section to read as follows:
30 1. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a person shall
31 not willfully and intentionally post or display in any public
32 manner the personal identifying information of another person
33 without the consent of the person if the information is required to
34 be kept private pursuant to federal or state law or regulation or
35 court rule.
36 2. Unless a greater penalty is provided by specific statute, a
37 person who violates this section is guilty of a category D felony
38 and shall be punished as provided in NRS 193.130.
39 3. As used in this section:
40 (a) “Personal identifying information” has the meaning
41 ascribed to it in NRS 205.4617.
42 (b) “Post or display in any public manner” means to
43 communicate or otherwise make available to the general public.
44 Sec. 6. NRS 125.080 and 125.110 are hereby repealed.
