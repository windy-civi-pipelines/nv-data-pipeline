FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.

~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to privacy; granting courts discretion to close family law
proceedings under certain circumstances; revising provisions
concerning the accessibility of court records in family law proceedings;
repealing an unconstitutional provision relating to the closure of certain
divorce proceedings; prohibiting the public posting or display of the
personal identifying information of another person under certain
circumstances; providing penalties; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the court in any action for divorce to close a proceeding upon the
2 demand of either party to the action. (NRS 125.080) In 2024, the Nevada Supreme Court held
3 that such a statute is unconstitutional because it permits closed court proceedings without the
4 exercise of judicial discretion. (Falconi v. Eighth Judicial District Court in and for the County
5 of Clark, 140 Nev. Adv. Op. 8, 543 P.3d 92 (2024)) Section 6 of this bill repeals this statute.
6 Section 2 of this bill defines the term “family law proceeding” to mean a proceeding
7 conducted pursuant to the provisions of Title 11 of NRS. Section 3 of this bill: (1) establishes
8 that family law proceedings are presumptively open unless an exception applies; and (2)
9 authorizes a court to exercise its discretion and close any such proceeding if the court
10 determines that closure is necessary to serve a compelling interest. Section 3 also requires the
11 court to: (1) consider certain factors when making this determination; and (2) exclude certain
12 persons from the court or chambers if the proceeding is closed. Additionally, section 3
13 provides that an electronic or video record of a private hearing: (1) is confidential and not
14 open to public inspection, except by the parties, their counsel and necessary staff or experts,
15 unless an exception applies; and (2) must not be distributed, copied or made publicly
16 available.
17 Section 4 of this bill governs which court records are accessible to the public in family
18 law proceedings. Under section 4, a court is authorized to seal or redact certain court records
19 if the court determines that the sealing or redaction is justified by a compelling interest that
20 outweighs the public interest in access to the court record. Section 4 also: (1) authorizes the
21 court to unseal a court record under certain circumstances; and (2) requires the court to
22 consider certain factors in determining whether to unseal a court record. Section 6 repeals an
23 existing statute governing which court records are accessible to the public in a divorce action,
24 which is being replaced by the provisions of section 4.
25 Section 5 of this bill prohibits a person from willfully and intentionally posting or
26 displaying in any public manner certain personal identifying information of another person
Senate Amendment No. 341 to Senate Bill No. 432 Page 4
27 without the consent of the person. Section 5 provides that a person who commits such an
28 unlawful act is guilty of a category [C] D felony.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Title 11 of NRS is hereby amended by adding thereto a new

9 exercise its discretion and close a proceeding if the court determines that closure
10 is necessary to serve a compelling interest.
11 3. In addition to any other factors the court considers relevant in
12 determining whether closure serves a compelling interest, the court shall
13 consider:
14 (a) The best interests of each child involved in the proceeding;
15 (b) Whether permitting a third party to observe or record the proceeding
16 creates a substantial risk of violating a federal or state law or regulation or court
17 rule relating to the disclosure of personal identifying information, including,
18 without limitation:
19 (1) Individually identifiable health information as defined in 45 C.F.R. §
20 160.103; or

22 Privacy Act of 1974, 20 U.S.C. § 1232g, and any regulations adopted pursuant
23 thereto; and
24 (c) Whether, in the absence of closure, there is a substantial risk that:
25 (1) A party to the proceeding or child involved in the proceeding may
26 suffer harassment, indignity, embarrassment, shame, financial loss,
27 stigmatization, harm to reputation, anxiety, fear or any other physical or
28 emotional harm; or
29 (2) The fundamental right of privacy of any person will be violated.
30 4. In addition to any other factors the court considers relevant in
31 determining whether closure is necessary to serve a compelling interest, the court
32 shall consider:

34 the compelling interest could be harmed; and
35 (b) Whether there are alternatives to closure that would adequately protect
36 the compelling interest.
37 5. If the court determines that a proceeding should be closed pursuant to
38 subsection 2:
39 (a) The court shall direct that the proceeding be private; and
40 (b) Except as otherwise provided in subsections 6 and 7, all persons must be
41 excluded from the court or chambers wherein the action is tried, except:

44 (3) The counsel for the parties and any staff of such counsel;
Senate Amendment No. 341 to Senate Bill No. 432 Page 5
1 (4) The witnesses for the parties, including, without limitation, expert
2 witnesses;
3 (5) The parents or guardians of the parties; and
4 (6) The siblings of the parties.
5 6. The court may, upon oral or written motion of either party or on its own
6 motion, exclude the parents, guardians or siblings of either party, or witnesses for
7 either party, from the court or chambers wherein the action is tried.
8 7. If the court determines that the interests of justice or best interests of a
9 child would be served, the court may permit a person to remain, observe and hear
10 any relevant portion of a proceeding, notwithstanding any request by a party that
11 the proceeding be private.
12 8. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection or by specific statute,
13 court rule or court order, an electronic or video record of a private hearing is
14 confidential and not open to inspection by any person. The parties, the counsel
15 for the parties and such staff and experts as the counsel for the parties deem
16 necessary may retain, view and copy an electronic or video record of a private
17 proceeding solely for purposes related to the representation.
18 9. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 8 or by specific statute, court
19 rule or court order, a person shall not distribute, copy or facilitate the distribution
20 or copying of an electronic or video record of a private hearing. A person who
21 violates this subsection shall, upon receiving notice of the violation:
22 (a) Cease and desist from the conduct; and
23 (b) Immediately remove the electronic or video record from public access.
24 10. As used in this section, the term “electronic coverage” includes
25 broadcasting, televising, recording and photographing.
26 Sec. 4. 1. In a family law proceeding:
27 (a) The following court records must be open to public inspection in the
28 clerk’s office:
29 (1) The summons and proof of service;
30 (2) If service is made by publication, the affidavit for publication;
31 (3) The pleadings;
32 (4) Any decree or other order, including, without limitation, an order
33 directing the publication of a summons; and
34 (5) Any judgment, including, without limitation, a judgment of default.
35 (b) The following court records are not open to public inspection except by
36 order of the court for good cause shown:
37 (1) Financial disclosure forms;
38 (2) Documents, records or evidence filed under seal;
39 (3) Documents sealed by a court pursuant to subsection 3;
40 (4) Confidential exhibits;
41 (5) Child custody evaluations;
42 (6) Medical records, including, without limitation, any medical,
43 psychiatric or psychological evaluation or report; and

45 federal or state law or regulation or court rule.
46 2. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 8 of section 3 of this act, all
47 other court records, including, without limitation, exhibits and transcripts of
48 testimony, are presumptively open to public inspection.
49 3. The court may, on its own motion or at the request of a party, seal or
50 redact a court record described in subsection 2 if the court determines that the
51 sealing or redaction is justified by a compelling interest that outweighs the public
52 interest in access to the court record. For the purpose of this subsection,
53 protecting personal identifying information concerning a party or child involved
Senate Amendment No. 341 to Senate Bill No. 432 Page 6
1 in the proceeding from disclosure shall be deemed to be a compelling interest that
2 outweighs the public interest in access to the court record.
3 4. The court may unseal a court record sealed pursuant to subsection 3:
4 (a) Upon written stipulation of all parties;
5 (b) Upon its own motion for good cause shown; or
6 (c) Upon the motion of a party for good cause shown. A copy of any such
7 motion must be served upon all parties to the proceeding.
8 5. In addition to any other factors the court considers relevant in
9 determining whether good cause exists for unsealing a court record pursuant to
10 subsection 4, the court shall consider:
11 (a) Whether the court record contains information made confidential by
12 federal or state law or regulation or court rule;
13 (b) Whether federal or state law or regulation or court rule provides that any
14 information in the court record is not a public record;
15 (c) Whether the party seeking to unseal the record has demonstrated a
16 legitimate interest in unsealing the record for a purpose related to the
17 representation;
18 (d) Whether unsealing the record would gratify private spite or promote
19 public scandal; and
20 (e) Whether unsealing the record would create a substantial risk that a party
21 to the proceeding or child involved in the proceeding may suffer harassment,
22 indignity, embarrassment, shame, financial loss, stigmatization, harm to
23 reputation, anxiety, fear or any other physical or emotional harm.
24 6. As used in this section, “court record” includes, without limitation, any
25 document, information or exhibit maintained by a court in connection with a
26 family law proceeding.

28 section to read as follows:
29 1. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a person shall not willfully
30 and intentionally post or display in any public manner the personal identifying
31 information of another person without the consent of the person if the
32 information is required to be kept private pursuant to federal or state law or
33 regulation or court rule.
34 2. Unless a greater penalty is provided by specific statute, a person who
35 violates this section is guilty of a category [C] D felony and shall be punished as
36 provided in NRS 193.130.

SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to privacy. (BDR 11-1020)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to privacy; granting courts discretion to close family law
proceedings under certain circumstances; revising provisions
concerning the accessibility of court records in family law proceedings;
repealing an unconstitutional provision relating to the closure of certain
divorce proceedings; prohibiting the public posting or display of the
personal identifying information of another person under certain
circumstances; providing penalties; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the court in any action for divorce to close a proceeding upon the
2 demand of either party to the action. (NRS 125.080) In 2024, the Nevada Supreme Court held
3 that such a statute is unconstitutional because it permits closed court proceedings without the
4 exercise of judicial discretion. (Falconi v. Eighth Judicial District Court in and for the County
5 of Clark, 140 Nev. Adv. Op. 8, 543 P.3d 92 (2024)) Section 6 of this bill repeals this statute.
6 Section 2 of this bill defines the term “family law proceeding” to mean a proceeding
7 conducted pursuant to the provisions of Title 11 of NRS. Section 3 of this bill: (1) establishes
8 that family law proceedings are presumptively open unless an exception applies; and (2)
9 authorizes a court to exercise its discretion and close any such proceeding if the court
10 determines that closure is necessary to serve a compelling interest. Section 3 also requires the
11 court to: (1) consider certain factors when making this determination; and (2) exclude certain
12 persons from the court or chambers if the proceeding is closed. Additionally, section 3
13 provides that an electronic or video record of a private hearing: (1) is confidential and not
14 open to public inspection, except by the parties, their counsel and necessary staff or experts,
15 unless an exception applies; and (2) must not be distributed, copied or made publicly
16 available.
17 Section 4 of this bill governs which court records are accessible to the public in family
18 law proceedings. Under section 4, a court is authorized to seal or redact certain court records
19 if the court determines that the sealing or redaction is justified by a compelling interest that
20 outweighs the public interest in access to the court record. Section 4 also: (1) authorizes the
21 court to unseal a court record under certain circumstances; and (2) requires the court to
22 consider certain factors in determining whether to unseal a court record. Section 6 repeals an
23 existing statute governing which court records are accessible to the public in a divorce action,
24 which is being replaced by the provisions of section 4.
25 Section 5 of this bill prohibits a person from willfully and intentionally posting or
26 displaying in any public manner certain personal identifying information of another person

Senate Amendment No. 341 to Senate Bill No. 432 Page 4
27 without the consent of the person. Section 5 provides that a person who commits such an
28 unlawful act is guilty of a category [C] D felony.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Title 11 of NRS is hereby amended by adding thereto a new
2 chapter to consist of the provisions set forth as sections 2, 3 and 4 of this act.

4 proceeding conducted pursuant to the provisions of this title.
5 Sec. 3. 1. Except as otherwise provided by specific statute or court rule,
6 family law proceedings are presumptively open.
7 2. Upon oral or written motion of either party, upon its own motion or upon
8 the filing of a request to provide electronic coverage of a proceeding, a court may
9 exercise its discretion and close a proceeding if the court determines that closure
10 is necessary to serve a compelling interest.
11 3. In addition to any other factors the court considers relevant in
12 determining whether closure serves a compelling interest, the court shall
13 consider:
14 (a) The best interests of each child involved in the proceeding;
15 (b) Whether permitting a third party to observe or record the proceeding
16 creates a substantial risk of violating a federal or state law or regulation or court
17 rule relating to the disclosure of personal identifying information, including,
18 without limitation:
19 (1) Individually identifiable health information as defined in 45 C.F.R. §
20 160.103; or

25 (1) A party to the proceeding or child involved in the proceeding may
26 suffer harassment, indignity, embarrassment, shame, financial loss,
27 stigmatization, harm to reputation, anxiety, fear or any other physical or
28 emotional harm; or
29 (2) The fundamental right of privacy of any person will be violated.
30 4. In addition to any other factors the court considers relevant in
31 determining whether closure is necessary to serve a compelling interest, the court

34 the compelling interest could be harmed; and
35 (b) Whether there are alternatives to closure that would adequately protect
36 the compelling interest.
37 5. If the court determines that a proceeding should be closed pursuant to
38 subsection 2:

1 (4) The witnesses for the parties, including, without limitation, expert
2 witnesses;
3 (5) The parents or guardians of the parties; and
4 (6) The siblings of the parties.
5 6. The court may, upon oral or written motion of either party or on its own
6 motion, exclude the parents, guardians or siblings of either party, or witnesses for
7 either party, from the court or chambers wherein the action is tried.
8 7. If the court determines that the interests of justice or best interests of a
9 child would be served, the court may permit a person to remain, observe and hear
10 any relevant portion of a proceeding, notwithstanding any request by a party that
11 the proceeding be private.
12 8. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection or by specific statute,
13 court rule or court order, an electronic or video record of a private hearing is
14 confidential and not open to inspection by any person. The parties, the counsel
15 for the parties and such staff and experts as the counsel for the parties deem
16 necessary may retain, view and copy an electronic or video record of a private
17 proceeding solely for purposes related to the representation.
18 9. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 8 or by specific statute, court
19 rule or court order, a person shall not distribute, copy or facilitate the distribution
20 or copying of an electronic or video record of a private hearing. A person who
21 violates this subsection shall, upon receiving notice of the violation:
22 (a) Cease and desist from the conduct; and
23 (b) Immediately remove the electronic or video record from public access.
24 10. As used in this section, the term “electronic coverage” includes
25 broadcasting, televising, recording and photographing.
26 Sec. 4. 1. In a family law proceeding:
27 (a) The following court records must be open to public inspection in the
28 clerk’s office:
29 (1) The summons and proof of service;
30 (2) If service is made by publication, the affidavit for publication;
31 (3) The pleadings;
32 (4) Any decree or other order, including, without limitation, an order
33 directing the publication of a summons; and
34 (5) Any judgment, including, without limitation, a judgment of default.
35 (b) The following court records are not open to public inspection except by
36 order of the court for good cause shown:

8 5. In addition to any other factors the court considers relevant in
9 determining whether good cause exists for unsealing a court record pursuant to
10 subsection 4, the court shall consider:
11 (a) Whether the court record contains information made confidential by
12 federal or state law or regulation or court rule;
13 (b) Whether federal or state law or regulation or court rule provides that any
14 information in the court record is not a public record;
15 (c) Whether the party seeking to unseal the record has demonstrated a
16 legitimate interest in unsealing the record for a purpose related to the
17 representation;
18 (d) Whether unsealing the record would gratify private spite or promote
19 public scandal; and
20 (e) Whether unsealing the record would create a substantial risk that a party
21 to the proceeding or child involved in the proceeding may suffer harassment,
22 indignity, embarrassment, shame, financial loss, stigmatization, harm to
23 reputation, anxiety, fear or any other physical or emotional harm.
24 6. As used in this section, “court record” includes, without limitation, any
25 document, information or exhibit maintained by a court in connection with a
26 family law proceeding.
27 Sec. 5. Chapter 205 of NRS is hereby amended by adding thereto a new
28 section to read as follows:
29 1. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a person shall not willfully
30 and intentionally post or display in any public manner the personal identifying
31 information of another person without the consent of the person if the
32 information is required to be kept private pursuant to federal or state law or
33 regulation or court rule.
34 2. Unless a greater penalty is provided by specific statute, a person who
35 violates this section is guilty of a category [C] D felony and shall be punished as
36 provided in NRS 193.130.
37 3. As used in this section:
38 (a) “Personal identifying information” has the meaning ascribed to it in
39 NRS 205.4617.
40 (b) “Post or display in any public manner” means to communicate or
41 otherwise make available to the general public.
42 Sec. 6. NRS 125.080 and 125.110 are hereby repealed.
