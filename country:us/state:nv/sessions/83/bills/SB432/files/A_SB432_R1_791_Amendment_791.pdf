AN ACT relating to privacy; granting courts discretion to close family law
proceedings or portions thereof under certain circumstances; revising
provisions concerning the accessibility of court records in family law
proceedings; repealing an unconstitutional provision relating to the
closure of certain divorce proceedings; prohibiting the public posting
or display of the personal identifying information of another person
under certain circumstances; providing penalties; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the court in any action for divorce to close a proceeding upon the
2 demand of either party to the action. (NRS 125.080) In 2024, the Nevada Supreme Court held
3 that such a statute is unconstitutional because it permits closed court proceedings without the
4 exercise of judicial discretion. (Falconi v. Eighth Judicial District Court in and for the County
5 of Clark, 140 Nev. Adv. Op. 8, 543 P.3d 92 (2024)) Section 6 of this bill repeals this statute.
6 Section 2 of this bill defines the term “family law proceeding” to mean a proceeding
7 conducted pursuant to the provisions of Title 11 of NRS. Section 3 of this bill: (1) establishes
8 that family law proceedings are presumptively open unless an exception applies; and (2)
9 authorizes a court to exercise its discretion and close any such proceeding or portion thereof
10 if the court determines that closure is necessary to serve a compelling interest. Section 3 also
11 requires the court to: (1) consider certain factors when making this determination; [and] (2)
12 make certain written findings; and (3) exclude certain persons from the court or chambers if
13 the proceeding is closed. Additionally, section 3 provides , with certain exceptions, that [an]
14 a transcript, audio recording or electronic or video record of a [private] closed portion of a
15 hearing [:] or trial: (1) is confidential and not open to [public] inspection [,] or copying,
16 except by the parties, their counsel and necessary staff or experts ; [, unless an exception
17 applies;] and (2) must not be distributed . [, copied or made publicly available.]
18 Section 4 of this bill governs which court records are accessible to the public in family
19 law proceedings. Under section 4, a court is authorized to seal or redact certain court records
20 if the court determines that the sealing or redaction is justified by a compelling interest that
21 outweighs the public interest in access to the court record. Section 4 also: (1) authorizes the
22 court to unseal a court record under certain circumstances; and (2) requires the court to
23 consider certain factors in determining whether to unseal a court record. Section 6 repeals an
24 existing statute governing which court records are accessible to the public in a divorce action,
25 which is being replaced by the provisions of section 4.

Assembly Amendment No. 791 to Senate Bill No. 432 First Reprint Page 4
26 Section 5 of this bill prohibits a person from willfully and intentionally posting or
27 displaying in any public manner certain personal identifying information of another person
28 without the consent of the person. Section 5 provides that a person who commits such an
29 unlawful act is guilty of a category D felony.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Title 11 of NRS is hereby amended by adding thereto a new
2 chapter to consist of the provisions set forth as sections 2, 3 and 4 of this act.
3 Sec. 2. As used in this chapter, “family law proceeding” means a
4 proceeding conducted pursuant to the provisions of this title.
5 Sec. 3. 1. Except as otherwise provided by specific statute or court rule,
6 family law proceedings are presumptively open.
7 2. Upon oral or written motion of either party, upon its own motion or upon
8 the filing of a request to provide electronic coverage of a proceeding, a court may
9 exercise its discretion and close a proceeding or portion thereof only if the court
10 determines that closure is necessary to serve a compelling interest.
11 3. In addition to any other factors the court considers relevant in
12 determining whether closure serves a compelling interest, the court shall
13 consider:
14 (a) The presumption set forth in subsection 1;
15 (b) The best interest of each child involved in the proceeding;
16 [(b)] (c) Whether permitting a third party to observe or record the proceeding
17 creates a substantial risk of violating a federal or state law or regulation or court
18 rule relating to the disclosure of personal identifying information [, including,]
19 that cannot be mitigated by sealing court records. As used in this paragraph,
20 “personal identifying information” includes, without limitation:
21 (1) Individually identifiable health information as defined in 45 C.F.R. §
22 160.103; or
23 (2) Educational records under the Family Educational Rights and
24 Privacy Act of 1974, 20 U.S.C. § 1232g, and any regulations adopted pursuant
25 thereto; and
26 [(c)] (d) Whether, in the absence of closure, there is a substantial risk that:
27 (1) A party to the proceeding or child involved in the proceeding may
28 suffer harassment, indignity, undue embarrassment [, shame, financial loss,
29 stigmatization, harm to reputation, anxiety, fear] or any other physical or
30 emotional harm; or
31 (2) The fundamental right of privacy of any person will be violated.
32 4. [In addition to] After considering the factors set forth in subsection 3 and
33 any other factors the court considers relevant in determining whether closure is
34 necessary to serve a compelling interest, the court shall [consider:] make written
35 findings regarding:
36 (a) Whether there is a substantial probability that, in the absence of closure,
37 the compelling interest [could] will be harmed; [and]
38 (b) Whether there are alternatives to closure that would adequately protect
39 the compelling interest [.] ; and
40 (c) Whether the closure is narrowly tailored to protect the compelling
41 interest.
42 5. If the court determines that a proceeding or portion thereof should be
43 closed pursuant to subsection 2:

Assembly Amendment No. 791 to Senate Bill No. 432 First Reprint Page 5
1 (a) The court shall direct that the proceeding or portion thereof be [private;]
2 closed; and
3 (b) Except as otherwise provided in subsections 6 and 7, all persons must be
4 excluded from the court or chambers wherein the action is tried, except:
5 (1) The officers of the court;
6 (2) The parties;
7 (3) The counsel for the parties and any staff of such counsel;
8 (4) The witnesses for the parties, including, without limitation, expert
9 witnesses;
10 (5) The [parents or] guardians of the parties; and
11 (6) [The siblings] Persons who are related within the third degree of
12 consanguinity to the parties.
13 6. The court may, upon oral or written motion of either party or on its own
14 motion, exclude [the parents, guardians or siblings of either party,] any person
15 described in subparagraph (4), (5) or [witnesses for either party,] (6) of
16 paragraph (b) of subsection 5 from the court or chambers wherein the action is
17 tried.
18 7. If the court determines that the interests of justice or best interests of a
19 child would be served, the court may permit a person to remain, observe and hear
20 any relevant portion of a proceeding, notwithstanding any request by a party that
21 the proceeding be [private.] closed.
22 8. Except as otherwise provided [in this subsection or] by specific statute,
23 court rule or court order, [an] a transcript, audio recording or electronic or video
24 record of a [private] closed portion of a hearing or trial is confidential and not
25 open to inspection or copying by [any person. The] persons except the parties, the
26 counsel for the parties and such staff and experts as the counsel for the parties
27 deem necessary . [may retain, view and copy an electronic or video record of a
28 private proceeding solely for purposes related to the representation.]
29 9. [Except as otherwise provided in subsection 8 or by specific statute, court
30 rule or court order, a] A person with such access shall not distribute [, copy] or
31 facilitate the distribution [or copying] of [an] a transcript, audio recording or
32 electronic or video record of [a private] any closed portion of a hearing [.] or
33 trial, except as otherwise provided by specific statute, court rule or court order. A
34 person who violates this subsection shall, upon receiving notice of the violation:
35 (a) Cease and desist from the conduct; and
36 (b) Immediately remove the transcript, audio recording or electronic or video
37 record from public access.
38 10. As used in this section, the term “electronic coverage” includes
39 broadcasting, televising, recording and photographing.
40 Sec. 4. 1. In a family law proceeding:
41 (a) The following court records must be open to public inspection in the
42 clerk’s office:
43 (1) The summons and proof of service;
44 (2) If service is made by publication, the affidavit for publication;
45 (3) The pleadings;
46 (4) Any decree or other order, including, without limitation, an order
47 directing the publication of a summons; and
48 (5) Any judgment, including, without limitation, a judgment of default.
49 (b) The following court records are not open to public inspection except by
50 order of the court for good cause shown:

52 (2) Documents, records or evidence filed under seal;
53 (3) Documents sealed by a court pursuant to subsection 3;

Assembly Amendment No. 791 to Senate Bill No. 432 First Reprint Page 6
1 (4) Confidential exhibits;
2 (5) Child custody evaluations;
3 (6) Medical records, including, without limitation, any medical,
4 psychiatric or psychological evaluation or report; and
5 (7) Any documents, the copying or distribution of which is prohibited by
6 federal or state law or regulation or court rule.
7 2. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 8 of section 3 of this act, all
8 other court records, including, without limitation, exhibits and transcripts of
9 testimony, are presumptively open to public inspection.
10 3. The court may, on its own motion or at the request of a party, seal or
11 redact a court record described in subsection 2 if the court determines that the
12 sealing or redaction is justified by a compelling interest that outweighs the public
13 interest in access to the court record. For the purpose of this subsection,
14 protecting personal identifying information concerning a party or child involved
15 in the proceeding from disclosure shall be deemed to be a compelling interest that
16 outweighs the public interest in access to the court record.
17 4. The court may unseal a court record sealed pursuant to subsection 3:
18 (a) Upon written stipulation of all parties;
19 (b) Upon its own motion for good cause shown; or

21 motion must be served upon all parties to the proceeding.
22 5. In addition to any other factors the court considers relevant in
23 determining whether good cause exists for unsealing a court record pursuant to
24 subsection 4, the court shall consider:
25 (a) Whether the court record contains information made confidential by
26 federal or state law or regulation or court rule;
27 (b) Whether federal or state law or regulation or court rule provides that any
28 information in the court record is not a public record;
29 (c) [Whether] The interests of the party seeking to unseal the record [has
30 demonstrated a legitimate interest in unsealing the record for a purpose related to
31 the representation;] ; and
32 (d) [Whether unsealing the record would gratify private spite or promote
33 public scandal; and
34 (e)] Whether unsealing the record would create a substantial risk that a party
35 to the proceeding or child involved in the proceeding may suffer harassment,
36 indignity, undue embarrassment [, shame, financial loss, stigmatization, harm to
37 reputation, anxiety, fear] or any other physical or emotional harm.
38 6. As used in this section, “court record” includes, without limitation, any
39 document, information or exhibit maintained by a court in connection with a
40 family law proceeding.
