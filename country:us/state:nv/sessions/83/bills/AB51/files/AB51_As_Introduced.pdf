EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public records; authorizing a governmental
entity to charge a person who requests a copy of a public
record a reasonable fee for the use of its personnel or
technological resources; requiring a request to inspect,
copy or receive a copy of a public book or record to be in
writing and identify the requester; requiring, under certain
circumstances, a person who makes such a request to
make a reasonable effort to assist the governmental entity
in focusing the request; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 The Public Records Act provides that all public books and public records of a
2 state or local governmental entity, unless otherwise declared by law to be
3 confidential, are required to be open at all times during office hours for the public
4 to inspect, copy or receive a copy thereof. (NRS 239.010) Section 2 of this bill
5 requires a request to inspect, copy or receive a copy of a public book or public
6 record to: (1) be in writing; and (2) identify the person who is making the request.
7 Section 3 of this bill makes a conforming change to reflect the requirement for such
8 a request to be made in writing.
9 The Public Records Act authorizes a governmental entity to charge a fee for
10 providing a copy of a public record but such fee generally must not exceed the
11 actual cost to the governmental entity of providing the copy. (NRS 239.052) The
12 term “actual cost” means the direct cost incurred by a governmental entity in the
-

– 2 –
13 provision of a public record, including the cost of ink, toner, paper, media and
14 storage, but the term does not include a cost that a governmental entity incurs
15 regardless of whether or not a person requests a copy of a particular public record.
16 The Public Records Act also: (1) requires a governmental entity to charge certain
17 fees for a copy of a transcript of an administrative proceeding that has been
18 transcribed by a certified court reporter; and (2) authorizes a governmental entity to
19 charge certain fees for information from a geographic information system. (NRS
20 239.053, 239.054) Section 1 of this bill provides that, in addition to any other such
21 authorized fees, a governmental entity may charge a reasonable fee for the use of its
22 personnel or technological resources. Section 1 further provides that in order to
23 charge a fee for the use of its personnel or technological resources, the
24 governmental entity must adopt a written policy that: (1) provides a method for
25 calculating such a fee; and (2) requires the governmental entity to provide written
26 notice to the requester of the amount of the fee before preparing the requested
27 information.
28 Under the Public Records Act, if a person requests to inspect or copy a public
29 book or record or receive a copy of a public book or record which the governmental
30 entity is unable to make available by the end of the fifth business day after the
31 request was received, the governmental entity is required to perform certain actions,
32 including making a reasonable effort to assist the requester to focus the request in
33 such a manner as to maximize the likelihood the requester will be able to inspect,
34 copy or receive a copy of the public book or record as expeditiously as possible.
35 (NRS 239.0107) Section 3 requires the requester to make a reasonable effort to
36 assist the governmental entity in focusing the request.

SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

6 for the use of its personnel or technological resources in fulfilling
7 a request for a copy of a public record.
8 2. A governmental entity may charge a fee pursuant to
9 subsection 1 only if the governmental entity adopts a written policy
10 which:
11 (a) Provides a method for calculating the fee for the use of its
12 personnel and technological resources; and
13 (b) Requires the governmental entity to provide notice to the
14 requester, in writing, of the amount of the fee for the use of its
