7 Existing law sets forth various definitions that apply to provisions governing pupils

10 certain assignments for teachers, paraprofessionals or instructional aides who
11 provide instruction to pupils with disabilities; and (2) exceeding various limitations

22 the State Board of Education to develop certain guidelines concerning the universal
23 literacy screening administered pursuant to section 11 of this bill; and (2) revises
24 and sets forth, respectively, the minimum standards the State Board is required to

28 definitions that apply to provisions governing pupils with disabilities.
29 Existing federal law requires a due process hearing to be held concerning a
30 complaint relating to the identification of a pupil as a pupil with or without a
31 disability or the sufficiency of services provided to such a pupil. (20 U.S.C. § 1415)

51 screening, the board of trustees and governing body, as applicable, to perform
52 certain evaluations of the pupil. (NRS 388.441) Section 10 of this bill: (1) requires

76 school district and the governing body of each charter school, as applicable, to

101 such a pupil, an administrator is required to meet with the individualized education
102 program team for the pupil and determine whether the behavior is a manifestation
103 of the disability of the pupil.

105 and the governing body of each charter school to, on or before July 1, 2027, submit
