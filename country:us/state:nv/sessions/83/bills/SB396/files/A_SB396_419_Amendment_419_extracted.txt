Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Department of Education to ensure compliance with the
2 Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, federal regulations adopted pursuant to the Act
3 and statutes and regulations of this State that govern the education of pupils with disabilities.
4 (20 U.S.C. §§ 1400 et seq.; 34 C.F.R. Part 300; NRS 388.417-388.5243) Existing law requires
5 public schools to provide special programs and services for pupils with disabilities. (NRS
6 388.419, 388.429) Existing law sets forth various definitions that apply to provisions
7 governing pupils with disabilities. (NRS 388.417) Section 4 of this bill prohibits the board of
8 trustees of a school district or the governing body of a charter school from: (1) making certain
9 assignments for teachers, paraprofessionals or instructional aides who provide instruction to
10 pupils with disabilities; and (2) exceeding various limitations on the number of pupils with

Senate Amendment No. 419 to Senate Bill No. 396 Page 4
11 certain disabilities who may be in a classroom or receive certain support. Section 4
12 additionally sets forth certain requirements governing: (1) the placement of pupils in
13 special education classrooms; and (2) the composition of such classrooms. Section 5 of
14 this bill: (1) requires the Department to develop a plan to establish stability in providing a
15 program of special education to pupils; (2) sets forth certain requirements for the plan; and (3)
16 requires an individualized education program team to make certain considerations when
17 developing an individualized education program for a pupil with a disability who is subject to
18 an educational regression because of frequent changes in the location in which special
19 education services are provided. Section 9 of this bill: (1) requires the State Board of
20 Education to develop certain guidelines concerning the universal literacy screening
21 administered pursuant to section 11 of this bill; and (2) revises and sets forth, respectively, the
22 minimum standards the State Board is required to prescribe for programs of instruction or
23 special services for pupils with dyslexia and pupils with emotional disturbances, autism
24 spectrum disorder or developmental delays. Section 8 of this bill: (1) revises certain
25 definitions; and (2) creates certain definitions that apply to provisions governing pupils with
26 disabilities.
27 Existing federal law requires a due process hearing to be held concerning a complaint
28 relating to the identification of a pupil as a pupil with or without a disability or the sufficiency
29 of services provided to such a pupil. (20 U.S.C. § 1415) Existing law: (1) provides for the
30 selection of a hearing officer; (2) requires the local educational agency or governing body of a
31 charter school involved in the complaint to pay the cost of the hearing; and (3) authorizes an
32 aggrieved party to appeal the decision of a hearing officer to the Department. (NRS 388.463)
33 Section 13 of this bill: (1) sets forth certain requirements governing an expedited due process
34 hearing; (2) requires the Department to appoint a State Review Officer to make a
35 determination concerning appeals submitted after a due process hearing has concluded; and
36 (3) provides for a party to a due process hearing to request a temporary order of relief.
37 Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district and the governing body
38 of each charter school that serves pupils in kindergarten or grade 1, 2 or 3 to prescribe an early
39 literacy screening assessment for use by the schools located in the school district or the charter
40 school, respectively. (NRS 388.439) Existing law additionally requires: (1) the board of
41 trustees of each school district and the governing body of each charter school to administer
42 screenings for dyslexia to certain pupils in certain grade levels; (2) the board of trustees and
43 governing body, as applicable, to address the needs of a pupil if the screening confirms that
44 the pupil has indicators for dyslexia; and (3) if the response to scientific, research-based
45 intervention system of instruction determines that a pupil needs additional screening, the
46 board of trustees and governing body, as applicable, to perform certain evaluations of the
47 pupil. (NRS 388.441) Section 10 of this bill: (1) requires the board of trustees of each school
48 district and the governing body of each charter school to instead prescribe a universal literacy
49 screening that meets certain requirements; (2) requires such entities to administer the
50 screening to pupils enrolled in kindergarten and grades 1 to 6, inclusive, at least twice each
51 school year; [and] (3) sets forth certain requirements governing the results of the screening [.]
52 ; and (4) requires the board of trustees of each school district and the governing body of
53 each charter school to provide the parent or legal guardian of a pupil who was
54 administered the screening with a written notification containing certain information
55 concerning the results of the screening. Section 11 sets forth the requirements for: (1) a
56 pupil to receive additional screening or evaluations after taking the universal literacy
57 screening; (2) the person who administers the screening; and (3) certain meetings with
58 administrators concerning the results of the screening.
59 Existing law requires a pupil’s individualized education program team to consider certain
60 instructional approaches when developing an individualized education program for a pupil
61 with dyslexia. (NRS 388.443) Section 12 of this bill sets forth additional considerations for
62 developing such an individualized education program.
63 Section 2 of this bill requires the Department to establish a program to provide , at no
64 cost to a participant, professional development in certain areas concerning literacy to each
65 instructional aide, paraprofessional, member of support staff, administrator and teacher who
66 is employed by a school district or charter school to serve certain pupils. Section 3 of this bill
67 requires the board of trustees of each school district and the governing body of each charter
68 school, as applicable, to prepare and submit to the Department an annual report that contains

Senate Amendment No. 419 to Senate Bill No. 396 Page 5
69 certain information concerning the universal literacy screening administered pursuant to
70 section 11 and the professional development required pursuant to section 2.
71 Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district and the governing body
72 of each charter school to establish an emergency operations plan development committee to
73 develop a plan for responding to certain emergencies in each school. (NRS 388.241, 388.243)
74 Section 7 of this bill requires such a plan to include: (1) a consideration of the needs of pupils
75 with disabilities in certain emergencies; [and] (2) a plan to inform local law enforcement
76 agencies or public safety organizations of the specific needs of each pupil with a disability [.]
77 ; and (3) a plan to demonstrate that the committee has made certain individualized
78 considerations concerning pupils with disabilities.
79 Under existing law, the Legislature declares that members of the board of trustees of each
80 school district, the governing body of each charter school and all administrators and teachers
81 have a duty to create and provide a safe and respectful learning environment for all pupils.
82 (NRS 388.1321) Section 6 of this bill additionally requires : (1) a safe and respectful learning
83 environment to be provided for all staff members of a school [.] ; and (2) such an
84 environment to be free of predictable threats of bodily injury to all staff members and
85 pupils.
86 Existing law authorizes the suspension or expulsion of a pupil with a disability who
87 poses a continuing danger to persons or property or an ongoing threat of disrupting the
88 academic process or who is found in possession of a dangerous weapon other than a
89 firearm while in certain locations or at certain events. (NRS 392.466) Section 13.5 of this
90 bill provides that, before suspending or expelling such a pupil, an administrator is
91 required to meet with the individualized education program team for the pupil and
92 determine whether the behavior is a manifestation of the disability of the pupil.
93 Section 13.7 of this bill requires the board of trustees of each school district and the
94 governing body of each charter school to, on or before July 1, 2027, submit a report to
95 certain entities that includes information concerning the implementation of the
96 provisions of this bill.

38 10 cumulative days.
39 (d) Before a pupil with a disability is suspended or expelled pursuant to this
40 subsection, an administrator shall meet with the individualized education
41 program team for the pupil and determine, in accordance with the Individuals
42 with Disabilities Education Act, 20 U.S.C. § 1415, that the behavior of the pupil is
43 not a manifestation of his or her disability.
44 6. Except as otherwise provided in this section, any pupil, including, without
45 limitation, a pupil with a disability, who is found in possession of a firearm while
46 on the premises of any public school, at an activity sponsored by a public school or
47 on any school bus must be removed from the public school immediately upon being
48 given an explanation of the reasons for the removal of the pupil and pending
49 proceedings, which must be conducted as soon as practicable after removal, for his

14 days.
15 7. If a school is unable to retain a pupil in the school pursuant to subsections 1
16 to 6, inclusive, for the safety of any person or because doing so would not be in the
17 best interest of the pupil, the pupil may be suspended, expelled or placed in another
18 school. If a pupil, including, without limitation, a pupil who is less than 11 years of
19 age, is placed in another school, the current school of the pupil shall explain what
20 services will be provided to the pupil at the new school that the current school is
21 unable to provide to address the specific needs and behaviors of the pupil. The
22 current school of the pupil shall coordinate with the new school to create a plan of
23 action based on restorative justice for the pupil and to ensure that any resources

31 (a) Suspended from the school; or
32 (b) Expelled from the school under extraordinary circumstances as determined
33 by the principal of the school.
34 9. If the pupil is expelled, or the period of the pupil’s suspension is for one
35 school semester, the pupil must:
36 (a) Enroll in a private school pursuant to chapter 394 of NRS or be
37 homeschooled;
38 (b) Enroll in a program of independent study provided pursuant to NRS
39 389.155 for pupils who have been suspended or expelled from public school or a
40 program of distance education provided pursuant to NRS 388.820 to 388.874,
41 inclusive, if the pupil qualifies for enrollment and is accepted for enrollment in
42 accordance with the requirements of the applicable program; or
43 (c) Enroll in a program of alternative education provided by the school district
44 in which the pupil resides. Each school district shall, alone or through a partnership
45 with another school district, provide a program of alternative education pursuant to
46 this paragraph in an in-person setting that allows each pupil enrolled in the program
47 to receive educational services in the least restrictive educational environment.
48 10. The superintendent of schools of a school district or the administrative
49 head of a charter school or university school for profoundly gifted pupils, as
50 applicable, may, for good cause shown in a particular case in that school district or
51 public school, as applicable, allow a modification to a suspension or expulsion
52 pursuant to subsections 1 to 8, inclusive, if such modification is set forth in writing.
53 The superintendent or the administrative head of a charter school or university

Senate Amendment No. 419 to Senate Bill No. 396 Page 25
1 school for profoundly gifted pupils, as applicable, shall allow such a modification if
2 he or she determines that a plan of action based on restorative justice may be used
3 successfully.
4 11. This section does not prohibit a pupil from having in his or her possession
5 a knife or firearm with the approval of the principal of the school. A principal may
6 grant such approval only in accordance with the policies or regulations adopted by
7 the board of trustees of the school district or the governing body of the charter
8 school or university school for profoundly gifted pupils, as applicable.
9 12. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 5 or 6, a pupil with a disability
10 who is at least 11 years of age may, in accordance with the procedural policy
11 adopted by the board of trustees of the school district or the governing body of the
12 charter school or university school for profoundly gifted pupils, as applicable, for
13 such matters and only after the board of trustees of the school district or governing
14 body, as applicable, or its designee has reviewed the circumstances with the
15 individualized education program team for the pupil and determined that the
16 action is in compliance with the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, 20
17 U.S.C. §§ 1400 et seq., be:
18 (a) Suspended from school pursuant to this section for not more than 10 days.
19 Such a suspension may be imposed pursuant to this paragraph for each occurrence
20 of conduct proscribed by subsection 1.
21 (b) Expelled from school pursuant to this section.
22 (c) Permanently expelled from school pursuant to this section.
23 13. A homeless pupil or a pupil in foster care may be suspended from school
24 pursuant to this section for not more than 5 days if, following a review of all
25 available information, the principal determines that the conduct of the pupil poses
26 an ongoing threat to the pupil or other persons at the school and if a determination
27 is made that homelessness or being in foster care was not a factor in the behavior
28 that led to the consideration for suspension or expulsion. The person responsible for
29 making a determination of whether or not homelessness or being in foster care was
30 a factor in the behavior shall presume that homelessness or being in foster care was
31 not a factor in the behavior unless the person determines otherwise pursuant to this
32 subsection. A determination that homelessness was not a factor in the behavior
33 must be made in consultation with the local educational agency liaison for homeless
34 pupils designated in accordance with the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance
35 Act of 1987, 42 U.S.C. §§ 11301 et seq., or a contact person at a school, including,
36 without limitation, a school counselor or school social worker. A determination that
37 being in foster care was not a factor in the behavior must be made in consultation
38 with an advocate for pupils in foster care at the school in which the pupil is enrolled
39 or the school counselor of the pupil.
40 14. The principal of a public school may, at his or her discretion, reduce or
41 eliminate the period of suspension, convert an expulsion to a suspension or
42 otherwise reduce, eliminate or alter a disciplinary action imposed upon a pupil who
43 commits a battery which results in the bodily injury of an employee of the school.
44 15. The principal of a public school may reduce the period of suspension or
45 convert an expulsion to a suspension for a pupil who distributes a controlled
46 substance while on the premises of a public school, at an activity sponsored by a
47 public school or on a school bus if:
48 (a) The pupil is less than 11 years of age;
49 (b) The pupil has not engaged in such proscribed conduct before; and
50 (c) After a thorough review of the facts and circumstances, the principal
51 determines that the pupil did not know that the substance being distributed was a
52 controlled substance.

Senate Amendment No. 419 to Senate Bill No. 396 Page 26
1 16. The provisions of chapter 241 of NRS do not apply to any hearing or
2 proceeding conducted pursuant to this section. Such hearings or proceedings must
3 be closed to the public.
4 17. As used in this section:
5 (a) “Battery” has the meaning ascribed to it in paragraph (a) of subsection 1 of
6 NRS 200.481.
7 (b) “Bodily injury” means any actual damage or injury to a person that
8 interferes with or is detrimental to the health of the person and is more than merely

15 to pose a threat of, or cause, bodily injury to a person.
16 (d) “Firearm” includes, without limitation, any pistol, revolver, shotgun,
17 explosive substance or device, and any other item included within the definition of
18 a “firearm” in 18 U.S.C. § 921, as that section existed on July 1, 1995.
19 (e) “Foster care” has the meaning ascribed to it in 45 C.F.R. § 1355.20.
20 (f) “Homeless pupil” has the meaning ascribed to the term “homeless children
21 and youths” in 42 U.S.C. § 11434a(2).

33 18. The provisions of this section do not prohibit a pupil who is suspended or
34 expelled from enrolling in a charter school that is designed exclusively for the
35 enrollment of pupils with disciplinary problems if the pupil is accepted for
36 enrollment by the charter school pursuant to NRS 388A.453 or 388A.456. Upon
37 request, the governing body of a charter school must be provided with access to the
38 records of the pupil relating to the pupil’s suspension or expulsion in accordance

51 implementing the provisions of this act.
52 Sec. 14. The provisions of NRS 354.599 do not apply to any additional
