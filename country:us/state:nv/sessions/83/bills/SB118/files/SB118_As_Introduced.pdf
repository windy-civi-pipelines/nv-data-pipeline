Referred to Committee on Health and Human Services
SUMMARY—Revises requirements relating to coverage under
Medicaid for certain services provided by
pharmacists. (BDR 38-218)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to Medicaid; requiring Medicaid to include
coverage for certain services provided by a pharmacist;
imposing requirements relating to the rate of
reimbursement that a pharmacist must receive for services
covered under Medicaid; prohibiting Medicaid or a
managed care organization that provides health care
services to recipients of Medicaid from requiring prior
authorization for the services of a pharmacist under
certain circumstances; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Department of Health and Human Services to
2 administer Medicaid. (NRS 422.270) Section 1 of this bill requires the Director of
3 the Department to include under Medicaid: (1) coverage for services provided by a
4 pharmacist within his or her scope of practice if such services are covered when
5 performed by another provider of health care; and (2) reimbursement for such
6 services at an amount equal to or greater than the amount reimbursed to a
7 physician, physician assistant or advanced practice registered nurse for similar
8 services. Sections 1 and 5 of this bill prohibit Medicaid or a managed care
9 organization that provides health care services to recipients of Medicaid from
10 requiring prior authorization for such a service if prior authorization is not required
11 when the service is performed by another provider of health care. Sections 2, 3 and
12 6 of this bill remove requirements related to coverage under Medicaid for specific
13 services provided by pharmacists because section 1 would provide for the coverage
14 of such services. Section 4 of this bill makes a conforming change to indicate that
15 the provisions of section 1 will be administered in the same manner as other
16 provisions of existing law governing Medicaid.
