6 such a registration.
7 Section 3 of this bill requires the Division of Public and Behavioral Health of
8 the Department of Health and Human Services to adopt regulations to carry out the
9 provisions of the Nevada Revised Statutes relating to senior living community
10 referral agencies.
11 Section 7 of this bill provides that regardless of whether a senior living
12 community referral agency has obtained a license from the State Board of Health
13 before October 1, 2025, it may operate in this State without a license obtained from
14 the Board or a registration obtained from the Division until 120 days after the
15 regulations required to be adopted by the Division pursuant to section 3 are adopted
16 and approved pursuant to the Nevada Administrative Procedure Act.
17 Section 4 of this bill makes a conforming change to eliminate the requirement
18 that a senior living community referral agency obtain a license from the Board.
