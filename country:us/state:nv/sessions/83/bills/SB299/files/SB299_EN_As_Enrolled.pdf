Senate Bill No. 299–Senators Dondero Loop; Cannizzaro, Daly,
Flores, Lange, Nguyen, Ohrenschall and Taylor
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to health care; requiring a senior living
community referral agency to register with the Division of
Public and Behavioral Health of the Department of Health
and Human Services; setting forth certain requirements for a
senior living community referral agency to obtain such
registration and the renewal thereof; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law requires a senior living community referral agency to obtain a
license from the State Board of Health. (NRS 449.0305) Section 2 of this bill
requires instead that a senior living community referral agency register with the
Division of Public and Behavioral Health of the Department of Health and Human
Services. Section 2 further sets forth the requirements for obtaining and renewing
such a registration.
Section 3 of this bill requires the Division of Public and Behavioral Health of
the Department of Health and Human Services to adopt regulations to carry out the
provisions of the Nevada Revised Statutes relating to senior living community
referral agencies.
Section 7 of this bill provides that regardless of whether a senior living
community referral agency has obtained a license from the State Board of Health
before October 1, 2025, it may operate in this State without a license obtained from
the Board or a registration obtained from the Division until 120 days after the
regulations required to be adopted by the Division pursuant to section 3 are adopted
and approved pursuant to the Nevada Administrative Procedure Act.
Existing law authorizes the State Board of Health to set reasonable fees for the
licensing of any facility, establishment or service regulated to the Division. (NRS
439.150) Existing regulations adopted by the Board require: (1) an applicant for a
license to operate any referral agency to pay a fee of $2,708; and (2) an applicant
for the renewal of such a license to pay a fee of $1,354. (NAC 449.013) Section 2
provides that the amount of fees for an application to register or renew the
registration of a senior living community referral agency may not exceed these
amounts. Section 7.5 of this bill prohibits the Board from increasing these fees for
a senior living community referral agency.
Section 4 of this bill makes a conforming change to eliminate the requirement
that a senior living community referral agency obtain a license from the Board.
Existing law sets forth the grounds for the Division to deny a license or suspend
or revoke a license. (NRS 449.160) Section 5 of this bill applies these provisions to
the registration of a senior living community referral agency.
Existing law: (1) sets forth certain notice requirements before the denial,
suspension or revocation of a license issued by the Division; and (2) authorizes an
appeal and hearing relating to the denial, suspension or revocation of such a license.
(NRS 449.170) Section 6 of this bill applies these provisions to the registration of a
senior living community referral agency.
