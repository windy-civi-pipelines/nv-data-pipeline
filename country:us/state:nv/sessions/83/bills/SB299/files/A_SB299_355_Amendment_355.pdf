AN ACT relating to health care; requiring a senior living community referral
agency to register with the Division of Public and Behavioral Health of
the Department of Health and Human Services; setting forth certain
requirements for a senior living community referral agency to obtain
such registration and the renewal thereof; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires a senior living community referral agency to obtain a license from
2 the State Board of Health. (NRS 449.0305) Section 2 of this bill requires instead that a senior
3 living community referral agency register with the Division of Public and Behavioral Health
4 of the Department of Health and Human Services. Section 2 further sets forth the
5 requirements for obtaining and renewing such a registration.
6 Section 3 of this bill requires the Division of Public and Behavioral Health of the
7 Department of Health and Human Services to adopt regulations to carry out the provisions of
8 the Nevada Revised Statutes relating to senior living community referral agencies.
9 Section 7 of this bill provides that regardless of whether a senior living community
10 referral agency has obtained a license from the State Board of Health before October 1, 2025,
11 it may operate in this State without a license obtained from the Board or a registration
12 obtained from the Division until 120 days after the regulations required to be adopted by the
13 Division pursuant to section 3 are adopted and approved pursuant to the Nevada
14 Administrative Procedure Act.
15 Existing law authorizes the State Board of Health to set reasonable fees for the
16 licensing of any facility, establishment or service regulated to the Division. (NRS
17 439.150) Existing regulations adopted by the Board require: (1) an applicant for a
18 license to operate any referral agency to pay a fee of $2,708; and (2) an applicant for the
19 renewal of such a license to pay a fee of $1,354. (NAC 449.013) Section 2 provides that
20 the amount of fees for an application to register or renew the registration of a senior
21 living community referral agency may not exceed these amounts. Section 7.5 of this bill
22 prohibits the Board from increasing these fees for a senior living community referral
23 agency.
24 Section 4 of this bill makes a conforming change to eliminate the requirement that a
25 senior living community referral agency obtain a license from the Board.

Senate Amendment No. 355 to Senate Bill No. 299 Page 4
26 Existing law sets forth the grounds for the Division to deny a license or suspend or revoke
27 a license. (NRS 449.160) Section 5 of this bill applies these provisions to the registration of a
28 senior living community referral agency.
29 Existing law: (1) sets forth certain notice requirements before the denial, suspension or
30 revocation of a license issued by the Division; and (2) authorizes an appeal and hearing
31 relating to the denial, suspension or revocation of such a license. (NRS 449.170) Section 6 of
32 this bill applies these provisions to the registration of a senior living community referral
33 agency.
