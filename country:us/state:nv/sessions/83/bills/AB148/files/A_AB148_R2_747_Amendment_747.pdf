AN ACT relating to elections; revising the deadline for a county or city clerk to
distribute mail ballots to each active registered voter who resides
within the State; revising the deadline for a county or city clerk to
distribute sample ballots; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires, with certain exception, a county clerk or city clerk to distribute a
2 sample ballot to each registered voter in the county or city, as applicable, before the period for
3 early voting for any election begins. (NRS 293.565, 293C.530) Existing law further requires,
4 with limited exception, the county clerk or city clerk to distribute a mail ballot for every
5 election to: (1) each active registered voter; and (2) each person who registers to vote or
6 updates his or her voter registration information not later than 14 days before the election.
7 With certain exceptions, the deadline for distributing a mail ballot to: (1) each active
8 registered voter who resides within the State is not later than 20 days before the election; (2)
9 each active registered voter who resides outside the State is not later than 40 days before the
10 election; (3) each active registered voter who registers to vote after certain deadlines is not
11 later than 13 days before the election; and (4) each covered voter who is entitled to have a
12 military-overseas ballot transmitted pursuant to certain provisions of federal and state law is
13 not later than 45 days before the election. (NRS 293.269911, 293C.263, 293D.320) Further, in
14 the case of a special election where no candidate for federal office will appear on the ballot,
15 mail ballots must be distributed to each active registered voter not later than 15 days before
16 the special election. (NRS 293.269911, 293C.263)
17 Sections 1 and 3 of this bill revise the deadline for distributing a mail ballot to each
18 active registered voter who resides within the State from not later than 20 days before the
19 election to instead on or after the fifth Monday before the election but not later than the fourth
20 Monday before the election. Sections 1 and 3 also [require] authorize a county or city clerk
21 to allow a voter to elect to receive a mail ballot before that deadline. Sections 2 and 4 of this
22 bill require a county clerk or city clerk, as applicable, to distribute a sample ballot to each
23 registered voter before the applicable deadline for the clerk to distribute a mail ballot to the
24 registered voter. Section 5 of this bill makes a conforming change to require sample ballots
25 for an election relating to incorporating a city to be distributed before the applicable deadline
26 for the county clerk or registrar of voters to distribute a mail ballot to a registered voter for
27 such an election.
