city clerk to distribute mail ballots to each active registered
voter who resides within the State; revising the deadline for a

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law requires, with certain exception, a county clerk or city clerk to
distribute a sample ballot to each registered voter in the county or city, as
applicable, before the period for early voting for any election begins. (NRS
293.565, 293C.530) Existing law further requires, with limited exception, the
county clerk or city clerk to distribute a mail ballot for every election to: (1) each
active registered voter; and (2) each person who registers to vote or updates his or
her voter registration information not later than 14 days before the election. With
certain exceptions, the deadline for distributing a mail ballot to: (1) each active
registered voter who resides within the State is not later than 20 days before the
election; (2) each active registered voter who resides outside the State is not later
than 40 days before the election; (3) each active registered voter who registers to
vote after certain deadlines is not later than 13 days before the election; and (4)

mail ballots must be distributed to each active registered voter not later than 15
days before the special election. (NRS 293.269911, 293C.263)
Sections 1 and 3 of this bill revise the deadline for distributing a mail ballot to
each active registered voter who resides within the State from not later than 20 days
before the election to instead on or after the fifth Monday before the election but
not later than the fourth Monday before the election. Sections 1 and 3 also
authorize a county or city clerk to allow a voter to elect to receive a mail ballot
before that deadline. Sections 2 and 4 of this bill require a county clerk or city
