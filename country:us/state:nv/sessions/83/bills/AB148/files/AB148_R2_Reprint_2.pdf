Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires, with certain exception, a county clerk or city clerk to
2 distribute a sample ballot to each registered voter in the county or city, as
3 applicable, before the period for early voting for any election begins. (NRS
4 293.565, 293C.530) Existing law further requires, with limited exception, the
5 county clerk or city clerk to distribute a mail ballot for every election to: (1) each
6 active registered voter; and (2) each person who registers to vote or updates his or
7 her voter registration information not later than 14 days before the election. With
8 certain exceptions, the deadline for distributing a mail ballot to: (1) each active
9 registered voter who resides within the State is not later than 20 days before the
10 election; (2) each active registered voter who resides outside the State is not later
11 than 40 days before the election; (3) each active registered voter who registers to
12 vote after certain deadlines is not later than 13 days before the election; and (4)
13 each covered voter who is entitled to have a military-overseas ballot transmitted
14 pursuant to certain provisions of federal and state law is not later than 45 days
15 before the election. (NRS 293.269911, 293C.263, 293D.320) Further, in the case of
16 a special election where no candidate for federal office will appear on the ballot,
17 mail ballots must be distributed to each active registered voter not later than 15
18 days before the special election. (NRS 293.269911, 293C.263)
19 Sections 1 and 3 of this bill revise the deadline for distributing a mail ballot to
20 each active registered voter who resides within the State from not later than 20 days
21 before the election to instead on or after the fifth Monday before the election but
22 not later than the fourth Monday before the election. Sections 1 and 3 also require

– 2 –
23 a county or city clerk to allow a voter to elect to receive a mail ballot before that
24 deadline. Sections 2 and 4 of this bill require a county clerk or city clerk, as
25 applicable, to distribute a sample ballot to each registered voter before the
26 applicable deadline for the clerk to distribute a mail ballot to the registered voter.
27 Section 5 of this bill makes a conforming change to require sample ballots for an
28 election relating to incorporating a city to be distributed before the applicable
29 deadline for the county clerk or registrar of voters to distribute a mail ballot to a
30 registered voter for such an election.
