Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires, with certain exception, a county clerk or city clerk to
2 distribute a sample ballot to each registered voter in the county or city, as
3 applicable, before the period for early voting for any election begins. (NRS
4 293.565, 293C.530) Existing law further requires, with limited exception, the
5 county clerk or city clerk to distribute a mail ballot for every election to: (1) each
6 active registered voter; and (2) each person who registers to vote or updates his or
7 her voter registration information not later than 14 days before the election. With
8 certain exceptions, the deadline for distributing a mail ballot to: (1) each active
9 registered voter who resides within the State is not later than 20 days before the

11 than 40 days before the election; (3) each active registered voter who registers to
12 vote after certain deadlines is not later than 13 days before the election; and (4)
13 each covered voter who is entitled to have a military-overseas ballot transmitted
14 pursuant to certain provisions of federal and state law is not later than 45 days
15 before the election. (NRS 293.269911, 293C.263, 293D.320) Further, in the case of
16 a special election where no candidate for federal office will appear on the ballot,
17 mail ballots must be distributed to each active registered voter not later than 15
18 days before the special election. (NRS 293.269911, 293C.263)
19 Sections 1 and 2 of this bill require a county clerk or city clerk, as applicable,
20 to distribute a sample ballot to each registered voter before the applicable deadline
21 for the clerk to distribute a mail ballot to the registered voter. Section 3 of this bill
22 makes a conforming change to require sample ballots for an election relating to
23 incorporating a city to be distributed before the applicable deadline for the county
24 clerk or registrar of voters to distribute a mail ballot to a registered voter for such
25 an election.
