Assembly Bill No. 507–Committee on Ways and Means
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to state financial administration; revising
provisions relating to the procedure for the revision of the
budget of the Executive Department of the State
Government; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
The State Budget Act sets forth the process for the preparation and submission
of the proposed biennial budget for the Executive Department of the State
Government. (NRS 353.150-353.246) Under the State Budget Act, the head of any
department, institution or agency of the Executive Department, with certain
exceptions, is authorized, as a result of changed conditions, to request a revision to
a work program within its budget. Such a revision is required to be approved or
disapproved by the Governor or the Chief of the Budget Division of the Office of
Finance in the Office of the Governor. In addition, the department, institution or
agency is required under the State Budget Act to obtain approval from the Interim
Finance Committee, except in certain limited circumstances, before revising a work
program in an amount more than $75,000 if the cumulative impact of the revision
will increase or decrease by 20 percent or $350,000, whichever is less, the
expenditure level approved by the Legislature for any of the allotments within the
work program. (NRS 353.220) This bill: (1) clarifies that the $75,000 threshold
applies to any proposed revision to one or more of the categories of expense within
the work program; and (2) prohibits the dividing of a proposed revision of a work
program into separate requests to avoid the requirement of approval by the Interim
Finance Committee. Therefore, with certain exceptions, for a request for the
revision of a work program to require approval by the Interim Finance Committee,
the request must: (1) propose a revision in one or more of the categories of expense
within the work program in a total amount of more than $75,000, regardless of any
other revisions of the work program during the fiscal year; and (2) cumulatively,
based on other revisions of the work program during the fiscal year, increase or
decrease by 20 percent or $350,000, whichever is less, the expenditure level
approved by the Legislature for any of the categories of expense within the work
program.

Chief with a request for revision of the [allotments] work program
for the remainder of that fiscal year.
2. Every request for revision must be submitted to the Chief on
the form and with supporting information as the Chief prescribes.
3. Before encumbering any appropriated or authorized money,
every request for revision must be approved or disapproved in
writing by the Governor or the Chief, if the Governor has by written
instrument delegated this authority to the Chief.
4. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 8, whenever a
request for the revision of a work program of a department,
institution or agency :

(b) Would, when considered with all other changes in

2 and 3 and NRS 353.215, increase or decrease by 20 percent or
$350,000, whichever is less, the expenditure level approved by the
Legislature for any of the [allotments] categories of expense within
the work program,
 the request must be approved as provided in subsection 5 before
any appropriated or authorized money may be encumbered for the
revision. A proposed revision of a work program must not be
divided into separate requests to avoid the requirements of this
subsection.
5. If a request for the revision of a work program requires
additional approval as provided in subsection 4 and:
(a) Is necessary because of an emergency as defined in NRS
353.263 or for the protection of life or property, the Governor shall
take reasonable and proper action to approve it and shall report the
action, and his or her reasons for determining that immediate action
was necessary, to the Interim Finance Committee at its first meeting
after the action is taken. Action by the Governor pursuant to this
paragraph constitutes approval of the revision, and other provisions
of this chapter requiring approval before encumbering money for the
revision do not apply.
(b) The Governor determines that the revision is necessary and
requires expeditious action, he or she may certify that the request
requires expeditious action by the Interim Finance Committee.
Whenever the Governor so certifies, the Interim Finance Committee
has 15 days after the request is submitted to its Secretary within
which to consider the revision. Any request for revision which is not
considered within the 15-day period shall be deemed approved.
