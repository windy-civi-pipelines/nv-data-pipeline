EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to state financial administration; revising
provisions relating to the procedure for the revision of the
budget of the Executive Department of the State
Government; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 The State Budget Act sets forth the process for the preparation and submission
2 of the proposed biennial budget for the Executive Department of the State
3 Government. (NRS 353.150-353.246) Under the State Budget Act, the head of any
4 department, institution or agency of the Executive Department, with certain
5 exceptions, is authorized, as a result of changed conditions, to request a revision to
6 a work program within its budget. Such a revision is required to be approved or
7 disapproved by the Governor or the Chief of the Budget Division of the Office of
8 Finance in the Office of the Governor. In addition, the department, institution or
9 agency is required under the State Budget Act to obtain approval from the Interim
10 Finance Committee, except in certain limited circumstances, before revising a work
11 program in an amount more than $75,000 if the cumulative impact of the revision
12 will increase or decrease by 20 percent or $350,000, whichever is less, the
13 expenditure level approved by the Legislature for any of the allotments within the
14 work program. (NRS 353.220) This bill: (1) clarifies that the $75,000 threshold
15 applies to any proposed revision to one or more of the categories of expense within
16 the work program; and (2) prohibits the dividing of a proposed revision of a work
17 program into separate requests to avoid the requirement of approval by the Interim
18 Finance Committee. Therefore, with certain exceptions, for a request for the
19 revision of a work program to require approval by the Interim Finance Committee,
20 the request must: (1) propose a revision in one or more of the categories of expense
21 within the work program in a total amount of more than $75,000, regardless of any
22 other revisions of the work program during the fiscal year; and (2) cumulatively,
23 based on other revisions of the work program during the fiscal year, increase or
24 decrease by 20 percent or $350,000, whichever is less, the expenditure level

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN

1 Section 1. NRS 353.220 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 353.220 1. The head of any department, institution or agency
3 of the Executive Department of the State Government, whenever he
4 or she deems it necessary because of changed conditions, may
5 request the revision of the work program of his or her department,
6 institution or agency at any time during the fiscal year, and submit
7 the proposed revised work program to the Governor through the
8 Chief with a request for revision of the [allotments] work program
9 for the remainder of that fiscal year.

26 Legislature for any of the [allotments] categories of expense within
27 the work program,
28  the request must be approved as provided in subsection 5 before
29 any appropriated or authorized money may be encumbered for the
30 revision. A proposed revision of a work program must not be
31 divided into separate requests to avoid the requirements of this
32 subsection.
33 5. If a request for the revision of a work program requires
34 additional approval as provided in subsection 4 and:
35 (a) Is necessary because of an emergency as defined in NRS
36 353.263 or for the protection of life or property, the Governor shall
37 take reasonable and proper action to approve it and shall report the
38 action, and his or her reasons for determining that immediate action

1 after the action is taken. Action by the Governor pursuant to this
2 paragraph constitutes approval of the revision, and other provisions
3 of this chapter requiring approval before encumbering money for the

6 requires expeditious action, he or she may certify that the request
7 requires expeditious action by the Interim Finance Committee.
8 Whenever the Governor so certifies, the Interim Finance Committee

16 consider the revision. Any request which is not considered within
17 the 45-day period shall be deemed approved.
18 6. The Secretary shall place each request submitted pursuant to
19 paragraph (b) or (c) of subsection 5 on the agenda of the next
20 meeting of the Interim Finance Committee.

24 (b) The intent of the Legislature in approving the budget for the
25 present biennium and originally enacting the statutes which the
26 work program is designed to effectuate.
27 8. The provisions of subsection 4 do not apply to any request
28 for the revision of a work program which is required:
29 (a) As a result of the acceptance of a gift or grant of property or
30 services pursuant to subsection 5 of NRS 353.335; or
31 (b) To carry forward to a fiscal year, without a change in
