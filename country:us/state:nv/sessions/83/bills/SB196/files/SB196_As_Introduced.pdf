EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to taxation; providing for the imposition,
administration, collection and enforcement of a recovery
fee to offset property taxes levied on certain heavy
equipment; providing penalties; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, all property of every kind and nature in this State is subject
2 to property taxes unless the property is exempt from such taxation. (NRS 361.045)
3 In general, this bill authorizes a heavy equipment rental company that is primarily
4 engaged in the business of renting heavy equipment, without an operator, from a
5 location in this State to charge a recovery fee to offset the property taxes levied on
6 such heavy equipment. Sections 1, 17 and 18 of this bill clarify that such a
7 recovery fee is not included in the price of the rental of the heavy equipment for the
8 purpose of calculating the sales taxes imposed on the rental of the heavy
9 equipment.
10 Section 13 of this bill authorizes such a heavy equipment rental company to
11 charge a recovery fee in an amount equal to 2 percent of the rental charge for the
12 rental of the heavy equipment. Under section 13, a heavy equipment rental
13 company that charges a recovery fee is required to: (1) separately state on the
14 invoice provided to the renter the amount of the recovery fee charged to the renter;
15 (2) hold the recovery fee in a separate account; and (3) use the proceeds of the
16 recovery fee to offset the property taxes levied on heavy equipment rental property.
17 Section 14 of this bill exempts from the charging of a recovery fee the rental of any
18 heavy equipment rental property to certain governmental entities.
19 Section 15 of this bill requires a heavy equipment rental company to submit to
20 the Department of Taxation an annual report stating the amount of the recovery fees
21 collected by the heavy equipment rental company during the immediately
22 preceding fiscal year and the amount of the property taxes levied on the heavy
-

– 2 –
23 equipment rental property of the heavy equipment rental company for the
24 immediately preceding fiscal year. Under section 15, if the amount of the recovery
25 fees collected by the heavy equipment rental company during the immediately
26 preceding fiscal year exceeds the taxes levied on the heavy equipment rental
27 property of the heavy equipment rental company for the immediately preceding
28 fiscal year, the heavy equipment rental company is required to pay the excess, on a
29 pro rata basis, to the county treasurer of each county that levied property taxes on
30 the heavy equipment rental property. Finally, section 15: (1) requires each county
31 treasurer receiving such a payment to apportion the payment to the State and local
32 governments in the same manner that property taxes are apportioned; and (2)
33 provides that the requirement for a heavy equipment rental company to pay excess
34 recovery fees to a county treasurer is enforced in the same manner as the payment
35 of property taxes.
36 Sections 4-10 of this bill define certain terms relating to the imposition of the
37 recovery fee on the rental of heavy equipment rental property. Section 3 of this bill
38 establishes the applicability of those definitions.
39 Sections 11 and 12 of this bill establish provisions governing the retention and
40 examination of records relevant to the recovery fee. Section 16 of this bill provides
41 that a person who submits a false or fraudulent report concerning the recovery fee
42 or falsifies entries in or keeps more than one set of books, records or accounts with
43 intent to evade the tax is guilty of a gross misdemeanor.

44 purchaser or on a coupon, certificate or other documentation
45 presented by the purchaser.
