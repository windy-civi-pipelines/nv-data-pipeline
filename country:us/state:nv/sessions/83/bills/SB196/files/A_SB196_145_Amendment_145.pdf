EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to taxation; providing for the imposition, administration,
collection and enforcement of a recovery fee to offset property taxes
levied on certain heavy equipment; providing penalties; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, all property of every kind and nature in this State is subject to
2 property taxes unless the property is exempt from such taxation. (NRS 361.045) In general,
3 this bill authorizes a heavy equipment rental company that is primarily engaged in the
4 business of renting heavy equipment, without an operator, from a location in this State to
5 charge a recovery fee to offset the property taxes levied on such heavy equipment. [Sections
6 1, 17 and 18 of this bill clarify that such a recovery fee is not included in the price of the rental
7 of the heavy equipment for the purpose of calculating the sales taxes imposed on the rental of
8 the heavy equipment.] Under existing regulations, such a recovery fee would be excluded
9 from the sales or use tax charged for the rental of the heavy equipment. (NAC 372.940)
10 Section 13 of this bill authorizes such a heavy equipment rental company to charge a
11 recovery fee in an amount [equal] not to exceed 2 percent of the rental charge for the rental of
12 the heavy equipment. Under section 13, a heavy equipment rental company that charges a
13 recovery fee is required to: (1) separately state on the invoice provided to the renter the
14 amount of the recovery fee charged to the renter; (2) hold the recovery fee in a separate
15 account; and (3) use the proceeds of the recovery fee to offset the property taxes levied on
16 heavy equipment rental property. Section 14 of this bill exempts from the charging of a
17 recovery fee the rental of any heavy equipment rental property to certain governmental
18 entities.
19 Section 15 of this bill requires a heavy equipment rental company to submit to the
20 Department of Taxation an annual report stating the amount of the recovery fees collected by
21 the heavy equipment rental company during the immediately preceding fiscal year and the
22 amount of the property taxes levied on the heavy equipment rental property of the heavy
23 equipment rental company for the immediately preceding fiscal year. [Under section 15, if the
24 amount of the recovery fees collected by the heavy equipment rental company during the
25 immediately preceding fiscal year exceeds the taxes levied on the heavy equipment rental
26 property of the heavy equipment rental company for the immediately preceding fiscal year,
27 the heavy equipment rental company is required to pay the excess, on a pro rata basis, to the

Senate Amendment No. 145 to Senate Bill No. 196 Page 4
28 county treasurer of each county that levied property taxes on the heavy equipment rental
29 property. Finally, section 15: (1) requires each county treasurer receiving such a payment to
30 apportion the payment to the State and local governments in the same manner that property
31 taxes are apportioned; and (2) provides that the requirement for a heavy equipment rental
32 company to pay excess recovery fees to a county treasurer is enforced in the same manner as
33 the payment of property taxes.]
34 Sections 4-10 of this bill define certain terms relating to the imposition of the recovery
35 fee on the rental of heavy equipment rental property. Section 3 of this bill establishes the
36 applicability of those definitions.
37 Sections 11 and 12 of this bill establish provisions governing the retention and
38 examination of records relevant to the recovery fee. Section 16 of this bill provides that a
39 person who submits a false or fraudulent report concerning the recovery fee or falsifies entries
40 in or keeps more than one set of books, records or accounts , with intent to [evade the tax]
41 defraud in violation of the requirement to use the recovery fees only to offset property
42 taxes, is guilty of a gross misdemeanor.
