Senate Bill No. 196–Senator Cannizzaro
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to taxation; providing for the imposition,
administration, collection and enforcement of a recovery fee
to offset property taxes levied on certain heavy equipment;
providing penalties; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Under existing law, all property of every kind and nature in this State is subject
to property taxes unless the property is exempt from such taxation. (NRS 361.045)
In general, this bill authorizes a heavy equipment rental company that is primarily
engaged in the business of renting heavy equipment, without an operator, from a
location in this State to charge a recovery fee to offset the property taxes levied on
such heavy equipment. Under existing regulations, such a recovery fee would be
excluded from the sales or use tax charged for the rental of the heavy equipment.
(NAC 372.940)
Section 13 of this bill authorizes such a heavy equipment rental company to
charge a recovery fee in an amount not to exceed 2 percent of the rental charge for
the rental of the heavy equipment. Under section 13, a heavy equipment rental
company that charges a recovery fee is required to: (1) separately state on the
invoice provided to the renter the amount of the recovery fee charged to the renter;
(2) hold the recovery fee in a separate account; and (3) use the proceeds of the
recovery fee to offset the property taxes levied on heavy equipment rental property.
Section 14 of this bill exempts from the charging of a recovery fee the rental of any
heavy equipment rental property to certain governmental entities.
Section 15 of this bill requires a heavy equipment rental company to submit to
the Department of Taxation an annual report stating the amount of the recovery fees
collected by the heavy equipment rental company during the immediately
preceding fiscal year and the amount of the property taxes levied on the heavy
equipment rental property of the heavy equipment rental company for the
immediately preceding fiscal year.
Sections 4-10 of this bill define certain terms relating to the imposition of the
recovery fee on the rental of heavy equipment rental property. Section 3 of this bill
establishes the applicability of those definitions.
Sections 11 and 12 of this bill establish provisions governing the retention and
examination of records relevant to the recovery fee. Section 16 of this bill provides
that a person who submits a false or fraudulent report concerning the recovery fee
or falsifies entries in or keeps more than one set of books, records or accounts, with
intent to defraud in violation of the requirement to use the recovery fees only to
offset property taxes, is guilty of a gross misdemeanor.
