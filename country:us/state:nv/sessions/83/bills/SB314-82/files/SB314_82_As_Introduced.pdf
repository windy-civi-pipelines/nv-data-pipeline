~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to energy; revising a definition relating to certain
renewable energy facilities; revising provisions governing
the establishment by the Public Utilities Commission of
Nevada of biennial targets for the procurement of energy
storage systems by certain electric utilities; requiring the
Commission to reevaluate the existing biennial targets;
eliminating an obsolete provision relating to the
establishment of such targets; establishing requirements
for the installation of electrochemical energy storage
systems; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada to: (1)
2 determine, on or before October 1, 2018, whether it is in the public interest to
3 establish by regulation biennial targets for the procurement of energy storage
4 systems by certain electric utilities; and (2) if the Commission determines that it is
5 in the public interest to establish such targets, adopt regulations establishing
6 biennial targets for the procurement of energy storage systems by certain electric
7 utilities. (NRS 704.795, 704.796) Existing regulations, with certain exceptions,
8 establish progressively larger targets for the procurement of energy storage systems
9 by certain electric utilities, culminating in a requirement that certain electric
10 utilities procure energy storage systems capable of storing not less than 1,000
11 megawatts of electric power by December 31, 2030. Existing regulations also
12 require the Commission to review the existing biennial energy storage targets when
13 it reviews the resource plan submitted by an electric utility and determine whether
-

– 2 –
14 the targets should be altered. (Section 10 of LCB File No. R106-19) Section 1.5 of
15 this bill requires that the Commission establish biennial targets that deliver the
16 greatest benefits to the customers of the electric utility in relation to the costs of the
17 procurement of energy storage systems. Section 6 of this bill repeals the obsolete
18 provision that requires the Commission to determine whether to adopt regulations
19 to establish the biennial targets by October 1, 2018, given that those regulations
20 have been adopted. Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change relating to the
21 repeal of this obsolete provision.
22 Section 3 of this bill prohibits a person from installing an electrochemical
23 energy storage system unless the person holds a valid license in the classification
24 required to perform such work and, except under certain limited circumstances, for
25 installations occurring on property other than a residential property after July 1,
26 2025, ensures that the installation: (1) is performed by or under the direct
27 supervision of a person who holds a certificate demonstrating the successful
28 completion of the Energy Storage and Microgrid Training and Certification
29 program; and (2) conforms to certain standards regarding the installation of signage
30 in connection with such systems. Section 4 of this bill provides that a violation of
31 the provisions of section 3 is grounds for disciplinary action by the State
32 Contractors’ Board.
33 Section 1 of this bill revises the definition of “facility for the storage of energy
34 from renewable generation.”

generate electricity on an intermittent basis into the transmission and
distribution grid of the electric utility.
(2) The improvement of the reliability of the systems for the
transmission and distribution of electricity.
(3) The increased use of renewable energy resources to
generate electricity.
(4) The reduction of the need for the additional generation of
electricity during periods of peak demand.
