EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to taxation; requiring a scholarship organization to
use a donation for which a tax credit was received under
the Nevada Educational Choice Scholarship Program
within a certain time after the application for the tax credit
was approved; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law imposes a payroll tax on: (1) financial institutions and on mining
2 companies subject to the tax on the net proceeds of minerals, with the rate of the
3 payroll tax set at 2 percent of the amount of the wages, as defined under existing
4 law, paid by the financial institution or mining company during each calendar
5 quarter in connection with its business activities; and (2) other business entities,
6 with the rate of the payroll tax set at 1.475 percent of the amount of the wages, as
7 defined under existing law but excluding the first $50,000 thereof, paid by the
8 business entity during each calendar quarter in connection with business activities.
9 (NRS 363A.030, 363A.130, 363B.110, 612.190) Existing law provides a credit
10 against the payroll tax equal to an amount which must not exceed the amount of
11 any donation of money which is made by a taxpayer to a scholarship organization
12 that provides grants on behalf of pupils who are members of a household with a
13 household income below a certain level to attend schools in this State, including
14 private schools, chosen by the parents or legal guardians of those pupils. (NRS
15 363A.130, 363B.110, 388D.270) Existing law requires a scholarship organization,
16 before accepting a donation on behalf of a taxpayer, to apply to the Department of
17 Taxation for approval of the tax credit for the donation. (NRS 363A.139,
18 363B.119) Sections 1 and 2 of this bill require a scholarship organization to
19 expend the entire amount of any donation for which a taxpayer receives a tax credit
20 not later than 18 months after the date on which the application for the tax credit
21 was approved by the Department. Sections 1 and 2 require a scholarship
22 organization that does not expend the entire amount of a donation within this time
