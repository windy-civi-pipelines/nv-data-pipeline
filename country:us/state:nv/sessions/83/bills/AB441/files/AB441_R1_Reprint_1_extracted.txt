(BDR 32-6)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to taxation; revising provisions governing the
applications for a tax credit under the Nevada Educational
Choice Scholarship Program; requiring a scholarship
organization to use a donation for which a tax credit was
received under the Program within a certain time after the
application for the tax credit was approved; requiring a
scholarship organization to be a domestic nonprofit
corporation; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law imposes a payroll tax on: (1) financial institutions and on mining
2 companies subject to the tax on the net proceeds of minerals, with the rate of the
3 payroll tax set at 2 percent of the amount of the wages, as defined under existing
4 law, paid by the financial institution or mining company during each calendar
5 quarter in connection with its business activities; and (2) other business entities,
6 with the rate of the payroll tax set at 1.475 percent of the amount of the wages, as
7 defined under existing law but excluding the first $50,000 thereof, paid by the
8 business entity during each calendar quarter in connection with business activities.
9 (NRS 363A.030, 363A.130, 363B.110, 612.190) Existing law provides a credit
10 against the payroll tax equal to an amount which must not exceed the amount of
11 any donation of money which is made by a taxpayer to a scholarship organization
12 that provides grants on behalf of pupils who are members of a household with a
13 household income below a certain level to attend schools in this State, including
14 private schools, chosen by the parents or legal guardians of those pupils. (NRS
15 363A.130, 363B.110, 388D.270) Existing law requires a scholarship organization,
16 before accepting a donation on behalf of a taxpayer, to apply to the Department of
17 Taxation for approval of the tax credit for the donation. Existing law requires the
18 Department to approve or deny applications in the order in which the applications
-

– 2 –
19 are received. (NRS 363A.139, 363B.119) Sections 1 and 2 of this bill require
20 applications for approval of the tax credits to be made between May 1 and June 1 of
21 each year and require the Department to review and approve applications on or
22 before July 1 of each year. Sections 1 and 2 require each application to include
23 certain information, including information about the number of pupils meeting
24 certain criteria who have applied to the scholarship organization for a grant for the
25 upcoming school year and the cost to provide a grant to each such pupil. Sections 1
26 and 2 require the Department to approve applications for the tax credit: (1) first, up
27 to an amount that would allow every scholarship organization to make a grant to
28 every pupil who applied for a grant and received a grant for the immediately
29 preceding school year; (2) second, up to an amount that would allow every
30 scholarship organization to make a grant to every pupil who applied for a grant and
31 is the sibling of a pupil who received a grant for the immediately preceding school
32 year; and (3) finally, up to an amount that would allow every scholarship
33 organization to make a grant to every pupil who applied for a grant and is not in
34 one of the previous two categories. If sufficient tax credits are not available to
35 provide a grant to every pupil in a particular category, sections 1 and 2 require the
36 tax credits to be allocated among the scholarship organizations on a pro rata basis
37 according to the number of pupils in that category who applied to the scholarship
38 organization.
39 Sections 1 and 2 require a scholarship organization to expend the entire
40 amount of any donation for which a taxpayer receives a tax credit not later than 18
41 months after the date on which the application for the tax credit was approved by
42 the Department. Sections 1 and 2 require a scholarship organization that does not
43 expend the entire amount of a donation within this time period to repay to the
44 Department the tax credit that was allowed for the donation in an amount equal to
45 the amount of the donation that was not expended.
46 Existing law authorizes one or more natural persons to associate to establish a
47 nonprofit corporation under the laws of this State. (Chapter 82 of NRS) Section 2.5
48 of this bill requires a scholarship organization to be a domestic nonprofit
49 corporation.

FIRST REPRINT A.B. 441
ASSEMBLY BILL NO. 441–ASSEMBLYMEMBER MONROE-MORENO
MARCH 17, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Revenue
SUMMARY—Revises provisions governing the Nevada
Educational Choice Scholarship Program.
(BDR 32-6)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to taxation; revising provisions governing the
applications for a tax credit under the Nevada Educational
Choice Scholarship Program; requiring a scholarship
organization to use a donation for which a tax credit was
received under the Program within a certain time after the
application for the tax credit was approved; requiring a
scholarship organization to be a domestic nonprofit
corporation; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law imposes a payroll tax on: (1) financial institutions and on mining
2 companies subject to the tax on the net proceeds of minerals, with the rate of the
3 payroll tax set at 2 percent of the amount of the wages, as defined under existing
4 law, paid by the financial institution or mining company during each calendar
5 quarter in connection with its business activities; and (2) other business entities,
6 with the rate of the payroll tax set at 1.475 percent of the amount of the wages, as
7 defined under existing law but excluding the first $50,000 thereof, paid by the
8 business entity during each calendar quarter in connection with business activities.
9 (NRS 363A.030, 363A.130, 363B.110, 612.190) Existing law provides a credit
10 against the payroll tax equal to an amount which must not exceed the amount of
11 any donation of money which is made by a taxpayer to a scholarship organization
12 that provides grants on behalf of pupils who are members of a household with a
13 household income below a certain level to attend schools in this State, including
14 private schools, chosen by the parents or legal guardians of those pupils. (NRS
15 363A.130, 363B.110, 388D.270) Existing law requires a scholarship organization,
16 before accepting a donation on behalf of a taxpayer, to apply to the Department of
17 Taxation for approval of the tax credit for the donation. Existing law requires the
18 Department to approve or deny applications in the order in which the applications
-

– 2 –
19 are received. (NRS 363A.139, 363B.119) Sections 1 and 2 of this bill require
20 applications for approval of the tax credits to be made between May 1 and June 1 of
21 each year and require the Department to review and approve applications on or
22 before July 1 of each year. Sections 1 and 2 require each application to include
23 certain information, including information about the number of pupils meeting
24 certain criteria who have applied to the scholarship organization for a grant for the
25 upcoming school year and the cost to provide a grant to each such pupil. Sections 1
26 and 2 require the Department to approve applications for the tax credit: (1) first, up
27 to an amount that would allow every scholarship organization to make a grant to
28 every pupil who applied for a grant and received a grant for the immediately
29 preceding school year; (2) second, up to an amount that would allow every
30 scholarship organization to make a grant to every pupil who applied for a grant and
31 is the sibling of a pupil who received a grant for the immediately preceding school
32 year; and (3) finally, up to an amount that would allow every scholarship
33 organization to make a grant to every pupil who applied for a grant and is not in
34 one of the previous two categories. If sufficient tax credits are not available to
35 provide a grant to every pupil in a particular category, sections 1 and 2 require the
36 tax credits to be allocated among the scholarship organizations on a pro rata basis
37 according to the number of pupils in that category who applied to the scholarship
38 organization.
39 Sections 1 and 2 require a scholarship organization to expend the entire
40 amount of any donation for which a taxpayer receives a tax credit not later than 18
41 months after the date on which the application for the tax credit was approved by
42 the Department. Sections 1 and 2 require a scholarship organization that does not
43 expend the entire amount of a donation within this time period to repay to the
44 Department the tax credit that was allowed for the donation in an amount equal to
45 the amount of the donation that was not expended.
46 Existing law authorizes one or more natural persons to associate to establish a
47 nonprofit corporation under the laws of this State. (Chapter 82 of NRS) Section 2.5
48 of this bill requires a scholarship organization to be a domestic nonprofit
49 corporation.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 363A.139 is hereby amended to read as
2 follows:

7 2. To receive the credit authorized by subsection 1, a taxpayer
8 who intends to make a donation of money to a scholarship
9 organization must, before making such a donation, notify the
10 scholarship organization of the taxpayer’s intent to make the
11 donation and to seek the credit authorized by subsection 1. A

42 allocated among all the scholarship organizations which
43 submitted applications on a pro rata basis according to the
