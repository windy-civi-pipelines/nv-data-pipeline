Assembly Bill No. 441–Assemblymember Monroe-Moreno
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to taxation; revising provisions governing the
applications for a tax credit under the Nevada Educational
Choice Scholarship Program; requiring a scholarship
organization to use a donation for which a tax credit was
received under the Program within a certain time after the
application for the tax credit was approved; requiring a
scholarship organization to be a domestic nonprofit
corporation; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law imposes a payroll tax on: (1) financial institutions and on mining
companies subject to the tax on the net proceeds of minerals, with the rate of the
payroll tax set at 2 percent of the amount of the wages, as defined under existing
law, paid by the financial institution or mining company during each calendar
quarter in connection with its business activities; and (2) other business entities,
with the rate of the payroll tax set at 1.475 percent of the amount of the wages, as
defined under existing law but excluding the first $50,000 thereof, paid by the
business entity during each calendar quarter in connection with business activities.
(NRS 363A.030, 363A.130, 363B.110, 612.190) Existing law provides a credit
against the payroll tax equal to an amount which must not exceed the amount of
any donation of money which is made by a taxpayer to a scholarship organization
that provides grants on behalf of pupils who are members of a household with a
household income below a certain level to attend schools in this State, including
private schools, chosen by the parents or legal guardians of those pupils. (NRS
363A.130, 363B.110, 388D.270) Existing law requires a scholarship organization,
before accepting a donation on behalf of a taxpayer, to apply to the Department of
Taxation for approval of the tax credit for the donation. Existing law requires the
Department to approve or deny applications in the order in which the applications
are received. (NRS 363A.139, 363B.119) Sections 1 and 2 of this bill require
applications for approval of the tax credits to be made between May 1 and June 1 of
each year and require the Department to review and approve applications on or
before July 1 of each year. Sections 1 and 2 require each application to include
certain information, including information about the number of pupils meeting
certain criteria who have applied to the scholarship organization for a grant for the
upcoming school year and the cost to provide a grant to each such pupil. Sections 1
and 2 require the Department to approve applications for the tax credit: (1) first, up
to an amount that would allow every scholarship organization to make a grant to
every pupil who applied for a grant and received a grant for the immediately
preceding school year; (2) second, up to an amount that would allow every
scholarship organization to make a grant to every pupil who applied for a grant and
is the sibling of a pupil who received a grant for the immediately preceding school
year; and (3) finally, up to an amount that would allow every scholarship
organization to make a grant to every pupil who applied for a grant and is not in
one of the previous two categories. If sufficient tax credits are not available to
provide a grant to every pupil in a particular category, sections 1 and 2 require the
tax credits to be allocated among the scholarship organizations on a pro rata basis
-

– 2 –
according to the number of pupils in that category who applied to the scholarship
organization.
Sections 1 and 2 require a scholarship organization to expend the entire
amount of any donation for which a taxpayer receives a tax credit not later than 24
months after the date on which the application for the tax credit was approved by
the Department. Sections 1 and 2 require a scholarship organization that does not
expend the entire amount of a donation within this time period to repay to the
Department the tax credit that was allowed for the donation in an amount equal to
the amount of the donation that was not expended.
Existing law authorizes one or more natural persons to associate to establish a
nonprofit corporation under the laws of this State. (Chapter 82 of NRS) Section 2.5
of this bill requires a scholarship organization to be a domestic nonprofit
corporation.
