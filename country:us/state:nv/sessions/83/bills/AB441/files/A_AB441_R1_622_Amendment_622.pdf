Scholarship Program. (BDR 32-6)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to taxation; revising provisions governing the applications for a
tax credit under the Nevada Educational Choice Scholarship Program;
requiring a scholarship organization to use a donation for which a tax
credit was received under the Program within a certain time after the
application for the tax credit was approved; requiring a scholarship
organization to be a domestic nonprofit corporation; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law imposes a payroll tax on: (1) financial institutions and on mining companies
2 subject to the tax on the net proceeds of minerals, with the rate of the payroll tax set at 2
3 percent of the amount of the wages, as defined under existing law, paid by the financial
4 institution or mining company during each calendar quarter in connection with its business
5 activities; and (2) other business entities, with the rate of the payroll tax set at 1.475 percent of
6 the amount of the wages, as defined under existing law but excluding the first $50,000 thereof,
7 paid by the business entity during each calendar quarter in connection with business activities.
8 (NRS 363A.030, 363A.130, 363B.110, 612.190) Existing law provides a credit against the
9 payroll tax equal to an amount which must not exceed the amount of any donation of money
10 which is made by a taxpayer to a scholarship organization that provides grants on behalf of
11 pupils who are members of a household with a household income below a certain level to
12 attend schools in this State, including private schools, chosen by the parents or legal guardians
13 of those pupils. (NRS 363A.130, 363B.110, 388D.270) Existing law requires a scholarship
14 organization, before accepting a donation on behalf of a taxpayer, to apply to the Department
15 of Taxation for approval of the tax credit for the donation. Existing law requires the
16 Department to approve or deny applications in the order in which the applications are
17 received. (NRS 363A.139, 363B.119) Sections 1 and 2 of this bill require applications for
18 approval of the tax credits to be made between May 1 and June 1 of each year and require the
19 Department to review and approve applications on or before July 1 of each year. Sections 1
20 and 2 require each application to include certain information, including information about the
21 number of pupils meeting certain criteria who have applied to the scholarship organization for
22 a grant for the upcoming school year and the cost to provide a grant to each such pupil.
23 Sections 1 and 2 require the Department to approve applications for the tax credit: (1) first,
24 up to an amount that would allow every scholarship organization to make a grant to every
25 pupil who applied for a grant and received a grant for the immediately preceding school year;
26 (2) second, up to an amount that would allow every scholarship organization to make a grant

Senate Amendment No. 622 to Assembly Bill No. 441 First Reprint Page 4
27 to every pupil who applied for a grant and is the sibling of a pupil who received a grant for the
28 immediately preceding school year; and (3) finally, up to an amount that would allow every
29 scholarship organization to make a grant to every pupil who applied for a grant and is not in
30 one of the previous two categories. If sufficient tax credits are not available to provide a grant
31 to every pupil in a particular category, sections 1 and 2 require the tax credits to be allocated
32 among the scholarship organizations on a pro rata basis according to the number of pupils in
33 that category who applied to the scholarship organization.
34 Sections 1 and 2 require a scholarship organization to expend the entire amount of any
35 donation for which a taxpayer receives a tax credit not later than [18] 24 months after the date
36 on which the application for the tax credit was approved by the Department. Sections 1 and 2
37 require a scholarship organization that does not expend the entire amount of a donation within
38 this time period to repay to the Department the tax credit that was allowed for the donation in
39 an amount equal to the amount of the donation that was not expended.
40 Existing law authorizes one or more natural persons to associate to establish a nonprofit
41 corporation under the laws of this State. (Chapter 82 of NRS) Section 2.5 of this bill requires
42 a scholarship organization to be a domestic nonprofit corporation.
