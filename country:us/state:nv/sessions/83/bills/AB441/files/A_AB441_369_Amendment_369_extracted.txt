SUMMARY—Revises provisions governing the Nevada Educational Choice
Scholarship Program. (BDR 32-6)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to taxation; revising provisions governing the applications for
a tax credit under the Nevada Educational Choice Scholarship
Program; requiring a scholarship organization to use a donation for
which a tax credit was received under the [Nevada Educational Choice
Scholarship] Program within a certain time after the application for the
tax credit was approved; requiring a scholarship organization to be
a domestic nonprofit corporation; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law imposes a payroll tax on: (1) financial institutions and on mining companies
2 subject to the tax on the net proceeds of minerals, with the rate of the payroll tax set at 2
3 percent of the amount of the wages, as defined under existing law, paid by the financial
4 institution or mining company during each calendar quarter in connection with its business
5 activities; and (2) other business entities, with the rate of the payroll tax set at 1.475 percent of
6 the amount of the wages, as defined under existing law but excluding the first $50,000 thereof,
7 paid by the business entity during each calendar quarter in connection with business activities.
8 (NRS 363A.030, 363A.130, 363B.110, 612.190) Existing law provides a credit against the
9 payroll tax equal to an amount which must not exceed the amount of any donation of money
10 which is made by a taxpayer to a scholarship organization that provides grants on behalf of
11 pupils who are members of a household with a household income below a certain level to
12 attend schools in this State, including private schools, chosen by the parents or legal guardians
13 of those pupils. (NRS 363A.130, 363B.110, 388D.270) Existing law requires a scholarship
14 organization, before accepting a donation on behalf of a taxpayer, to apply to the Department
15 of Taxation for approval of the tax credit for the donation. Existing law requires the
16 Department to approve or deny applications in the order in which the applications are
17 received. (NRS 363A.139, 363B.119) Sections 1 and 2 of this bill require applications for
18 approval of the tax credits to be made between May 1 and June 1 of each year and
19 require the Department to review and approve applications on or before July 1 of each
20 year. Sections 1 and 2 require each application to include certain information, including
21 information about the number of pupils meeting certain criteria who have applied to the
22 scholarship organization for a grant for the upcoming school year and the cost to
23 provide a grant to each such pupil. Sections 1 and 2 require the Department to approve
24 applications for the tax credit: (1) first, up to an amount that would allow every
25 scholarship organization to make a grant to every pupil who applied for a grant and
Assembly Amendment No. 369 to Assembly Bill No. 441 Page 4
26 received a grant for the immediately preceding school year; (2) second, up to an amount
27 that would allow every scholarship organization to make a grant to every pupil who
28 applied for a grant and is the sibling of a pupil who received a grant for the immediately
29 preceding school year; and (3) finally, up to an amount that would allow every
30 scholarship organization to make a grant to every pupil who applied for a grant and is
31 not in one of the previous two categories. If sufficient tax credits are not available to
32 provide a grant to every pupil in a particular category, sections 1 and 2 require the tax
33 credits to be allocated among the scholarship organizations on a pro rata basis according
34 to the number of pupils in that category who applied to the scholarship organization.
35 Sections 1 and 2 [of this bill] require a scholarship organization to expend the entire
36 amount of any donation for which a taxpayer receives a tax credit not later than 18 months
37 after the date on which the application for the tax credit was approved by the Department.
38 Sections 1 and 2 require a scholarship organization that does not expend the entire amount of
39 a donation within this time period to repay to the Department the tax credit that was allowed
40 for the donation in an amount equal to the amount of the donation that was not expended.
41 Existing law authorizes one or more natural persons to associate to establish a
42 nonprofit corporation under the laws of this State. (Chapter 82 of NRS) Section 2.5 of
43 this bill requires a scholarship organization to be a domestic nonprofit corporation.

Referred to Committee on Revenue
SUMMARY—Revises provisions governing the Nevada Educational Choice
Scholarship Program. (BDR 32-6)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to taxation; revising provisions governing the applications for
a tax credit under the Nevada Educational Choice Scholarship
Program; requiring a scholarship organization to use a donation for
which a tax credit was received under the [Nevada Educational Choice
Scholarship] Program within a certain time after the application for the
tax credit was approved; requiring a scholarship organization to be
a domestic nonprofit corporation; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law imposes a payroll tax on: (1) financial institutions and on mining companies
2 subject to the tax on the net proceeds of minerals, with the rate of the payroll tax set at 2
3 percent of the amount of the wages, as defined under existing law, paid by the financial
4 institution or mining company during each calendar quarter in connection with its business
5 activities; and (2) other business entities, with the rate of the payroll tax set at 1.475 percent of
6 the amount of the wages, as defined under existing law but excluding the first $50,000 thereof,
7 paid by the business entity during each calendar quarter in connection with business activities.
8 (NRS 363A.030, 363A.130, 363B.110, 612.190) Existing law provides a credit against the
9 payroll tax equal to an amount which must not exceed the amount of any donation of money
10 which is made by a taxpayer to a scholarship organization that provides grants on behalf of
11 pupils who are members of a household with a household income below a certain level to
12 attend schools in this State, including private schools, chosen by the parents or legal guardians
13 of those pupils. (NRS 363A.130, 363B.110, 388D.270) Existing law requires a scholarship
14 organization, before accepting a donation on behalf of a taxpayer, to apply to the Department
15 of Taxation for approval of the tax credit for the donation. Existing law requires the
16 Department to approve or deny applications in the order in which the applications are
17 received. (NRS 363A.139, 363B.119) Sections 1 and 2 of this bill require applications for
18 approval of the tax credits to be made between May 1 and June 1 of each year and
19 require the Department to review and approve applications on or before July 1 of each
20 year. Sections 1 and 2 require each application to include certain information, including
21 information about the number of pupils meeting certain criteria who have applied to the
22 scholarship organization for a grant for the upcoming school year and the cost to
23 provide a grant to each such pupil. Sections 1 and 2 require the Department to approve
24 applications for the tax credit: (1) first, up to an amount that would allow every
25 scholarship organization to make a grant to every pupil who applied for a grant and

Assembly Amendment No. 369 to Assembly Bill No. 441 Page 4
26 received a grant for the immediately preceding school year; (2) second, up to an amount
27 that would allow every scholarship organization to make a grant to every pupil who
28 applied for a grant and is the sibling of a pupil who received a grant for the immediately
29 preceding school year; and (3) finally, up to an amount that would allow every
30 scholarship organization to make a grant to every pupil who applied for a grant and is
31 not in one of the previous two categories. If sufficient tax credits are not available to
32 provide a grant to every pupil in a particular category, sections 1 and 2 require the tax
33 credits to be allocated among the scholarship organizations on a pro rata basis according
34 to the number of pupils in that category who applied to the scholarship organization.
35 Sections 1 and 2 [of this bill] require a scholarship organization to expend the entire
36 amount of any donation for which a taxpayer receives a tax credit not later than 18 months
37 after the date on which the application for the tax credit was approved by the Department.
38 Sections 1 and 2 require a scholarship organization that does not expend the entire amount of
39 a donation within this time period to repay to the Department the tax credit that was allowed
40 for the donation in an amount equal to the amount of the donation that was not expended.
41 Existing law authorizes one or more natural persons to associate to establish a
42 nonprofit corporation under the laws of this State. (Chapter 82 of NRS) Section 2.5 of
43 this bill requires a scholarship organization to be a domestic nonprofit corporation.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 363A.139 is hereby amended to read as follows:

7 which approval is requested by all the applications submitted to the Department

42 that the credits are allocated among all the scholarship organizations which

18 otherwise due, carry the balance of the credit forward for not more than 5 years
19 after the end of the calendar year in which the donation is made or until the balance
20 of the credit is applied, whichever is earlier.
21 [8.] 10. A scholarship organization shall expend the entire amount of any
22 donation for which a taxpayer received a tax credit pursuant to this section not

28 which the scholarship organization is required to repay pursuant to this
29 subsection shall be equal to the amount of the donation that was not expended
30 within the time required.
