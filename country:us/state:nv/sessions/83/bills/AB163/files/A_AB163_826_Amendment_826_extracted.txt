AN ACT relating to mental health; ratifying and entering into the Counseling
Compact; authorizing the sharing of certain information with the
coordinated database and reporting system created by the Compact;
providing licensed professional counselors practicing in this State
under the Compact with the same legal status as clinical professional
counselors who are licensed in this State; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law regulates the practice of licensed professional counselors, known as clinical
2 professional counselors, in this State. (Chapter 641A of NRS) Section 1 of this bill ratifies
3 and enters into the Counseling Compact, which is an interstate compact that allows a person
4 who is licensed as a licensed professional counselor in a state that is a member of the Compact
5 to practice as a licensed professional counselor in other states that are members of the
6 Compact. In order to practice as a licensed professional counselor under the Compact, the
7 Compact requires a licensed professional counselor to: (1) hold a license in his or her home
8 state; (2) have a valid social security number or National Practitioner Identifier; (3) notify the
9 Counseling Compact Commission, a joint public agency established by the Compact, that he
10 or she is seeking to practice under the Compact in another state; (4) have had no
11 encumbrances or restrictions placed against any license or authority to practice under the
12 Compact within the previous 2 years; (5) pay any applicable fees; (6) meet any requirements
13 for continuing education established by his or her home state; (7) meet any requirement in the
14 state in which he or she seeks to practice under the Compact to pass an assessment of his or
15 her knowledge of the applicable laws and rules of that state; and (8) report any adverse action
16 taken against him or her or any encumbrance or restriction placed upon him or her in a non-
17 member state within 30 days after the date of the adverse action or the placement of the
18 encumbrance or restriction, as applicable. The Compact also requires a member state to
19 authorize a professional counselor who is licensed in a member state to provide counseling
20 services via telehealth to a patient located in any member state under rules prescribed by the
21 Commission. The Compact authorizes a member state to take certain adverse actions against a
22 licensed professional counselor practicing within that member state under the Compact. The
23 Compact requires the Commission, among other duties, to: (1) establish bylaws; (2) make
24 rules that facilitate and coordinate implementation and administration of the Compact; (3)
25 hold meetings, which may be closed to the public under certain conditions; (4) develop,
26 maintain and use a coordinated database and reporting system; and (5) resolve disputes related
27 to the Compact among states that are members of the Compact. The Commission is
Assembly Amendment No. 826 to Assembly Bill No. 163 Page 4
28 additionally authorized to levy and collect an annual assessment from each state that is a
29 member of the Compact.
30 Section 2 of this bill authorizes the Board of Examiners for Marriage and Family
31 Therapists and Clinical Professional Counselors to disclose certain investigatory information
32 to the Commission and the coordinated database and reporting system when required by the
33 Compact. Sections 1 and 4 of this bill provide for the confidentiality of certain information
34 disclosed to the Board from the coordinated database and reporting system.
35 Section 3 of this bill deems practicing as a licensed professional counselor under the
36 Compact to be equivalent to practicing as a clinical professional counselor under a license
37 issued by the Board.

26 statutory law.
27 2. All courts shall take judicial notice of the Compact and the Rules in
28 any judicial or administrative proceeding in a Member State pertaining to the
29 subject matter of this Compact which may affect the powers, responsibilities, or
30 actions of the Commission.
31 3. The Commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any
32 such proceeding and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all
33 purposes. Failure to provide service of process to the Commission shall render a
34 judgment or order void as to the Commission, this Compact, or promulgated
35 Rules.
36 B. Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination
37 1. If the Commission determines that a Member State has defaulted in
38 the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this Compact or the
39 promulgated Rules, the Commission shall:
40 a. Provide written notice to the defaulting State and other Member
41 States of the nature of the default, the proposed means of curing the default
42 and/or any other action to be taken by the Commission; and
43 b. Provide remedial training and specific technical assistance
44 regarding the default.
45 C. If a State in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting State may be
46 terminated from the Compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the
47 Member States, and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this Compact
48 may be terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does
49 not relieve the offending State of obligations or liabilities incurred during the
50 period of default.
51 D. Termination of membership in the Compact shall be imposed only after
52 all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to
53 suspend or terminate shall be given by the Commission to the governor, the
Assembly Amendment No. 826 to Assembly Bill No. 163 Page 18
1 majority and minority leaders of the defaulting State’s legislature, and each of
2 the Member States.
3 E. A State that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments,
4 obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination,
5 including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of termination.

7 to be in default or that has been terminated from the Compact, unless agreed
8 upon in writing between the Commission and the defaulting State.

10 petitioning the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal
11 district where the Commission has its principal offices. The prevailing member

13 H. Dispute Resolution
14 1. Upon request by a Member State, the Commission shall attempt to
15 resolve disputes related to the Compact that arise among Member States and
16 between member and non-Member States.
17 2. The Commission shall promulgate a Rule providing for both
18 mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.
19 I. Enforcement
20 1. The Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall
21 enforce the provisions and Rules of this Compact.
22 2. By majority vote, the Commission may initiate legal action in the
23 United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district
24 where the Commission has its principal offices against a Member State in default
25 to enforce compliance with the provisions of the Compact and its promulgated
26 Rules and bylaws. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and
27 damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing member
28 shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees.
29 3. The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the
30 Commission. The Commission may pursue any other remedies available under
31 federal or State law.
32
33 SECTION 13. DATE OF IMPLEMENTATION
34 OF THE COUNSELING COMPACT
35 COMMISSION AND ASSOCIATED RULES,

50 statute repealing the same.

Assembly Amendment No. 826 to Assembly Bill No. 163 Page 19
1 2. Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the
2 withdrawing State’s Professional Counseling Licensing Board to comply with the
3 investigative and Adverse Action reporting requirements of this act prior to the
4 effective date of withdrawal.

6 prevent any Professional Counseling licensure agreement or other cooperative

19 thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the
20 validity of the remainder of this Compact and the applicability thereof to any
21 government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this
22 Compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any Member State, the
23 Compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining Member States
24 and in full force and effect as to the Member State affected as to all severable
25 matters.

35 Statutes of Nevada 2011 and section 2 of chapter 391, Statutes of Nevada 2013 and
36 unless otherwise declared by law to be confidential, all public books and public
37 records of a governmental entity must be open at all times during office hours to
38 inspection by any person, and may be fully copied or an abstract or memorandum
39 may be prepared from those public books and public records. Any such copies,
40 abstracts or memoranda may be used to supply the general public with copies,
41 abstracts or memoranda of the records or may be used in any other way to the
42 advantage of the governmental entity or of the general public. This section does not
43 supersede or in any manner affect the federal laws governing copyrights or enlarge,
44 diminish or affect in any other manner the rights of a person in any written book or
45 record which is copyrighted pursuant to federal law.
46 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record which is
47 copyrighted solely because it is copyrighted.
48 3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a public book or
49 record shall not deny a request made pursuant to subsection 1 to inspect or copy or
50 receive a copy of a public book or record on the basis that the requested public
51 book or record contains information that is confidential if the governmental entity
52 can redact, delete, conceal or separate, including, without limitation, electronically,
Assembly Amendment No. 826 to Assembly Bill No. 163 Page 22
1 the confidential information from the information included in the public book or
2 record that is not otherwise confidential.
3 4. If requested, a governmental entity shall provide a copy of a public record
4 in an electronic format by means of an electronic medium. Nothing in this
5 subsection requires a governmental entity to provide a copy of a public record in an
6 electronic format or by means of an electronic medium if:
7 (a) The public record:
8 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
9 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
10 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by means of an
11 electronic medium would:
12 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
13 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential and that
14 cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from information that is not
15 otherwise confidential.
16 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who has legal
17 custody or control of a public record:
18 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the medium that
19 is requested because the officer, employee or agent has already prepared or would
20 prefer to provide the copy in a different medium.
21 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon request, prepare
22 the copy of the public record and shall not require the person who has requested the
23 copy to prepare the copy himself or herself.
24 Sec. 5. This act becomes effective on [July 1, 2025.] January 1, 2026.

~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to mental health; ratifying and entering into the Counseling
Compact; authorizing the sharing of certain information with the
coordinated database and reporting system created by the Compact;
providing licensed professional counselors practicing in this State
under the Compact with the same legal status as clinical professional
counselors who are licensed in this State; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law regulates the practice of licensed professional counselors, known as clinical
2 professional counselors, in this State. (Chapter 641A of NRS) Section 1 of this bill ratifies
3 and enters into the Counseling Compact, which is an interstate compact that allows a person
4 who is licensed as a licensed professional counselor in a state that is a member of the Compact
5 to practice as a licensed professional counselor in other states that are members of the
6 Compact. In order to practice as a licensed professional counselor under the Compact, the
7 Compact requires a licensed professional counselor to: (1) hold a license in his or her home
8 state; (2) have a valid social security number or National Practitioner Identifier; (3) notify the
9 Counseling Compact Commission, a joint public agency established by the Compact, that he
10 or she is seeking to practice under the Compact in another state; (4) have had no
11 encumbrances or restrictions placed against any license or authority to practice under the
12 Compact within the previous 2 years; (5) pay any applicable fees; (6) meet any requirements
13 for continuing education established by his or her home state; (7) meet any requirement in the
14 state in which he or she seeks to practice under the Compact to pass an assessment of his or
15 her knowledge of the applicable laws and rules of that state; and (8) report any adverse action
16 taken against him or her or any encumbrance or restriction placed upon him or her in a non-
17 member state within 30 days after the date of the adverse action or the placement of the
18 encumbrance or restriction, as applicable. The Compact also requires a member state to
19 authorize a professional counselor who is licensed in a member state to provide counseling
20 services via telehealth to a patient located in any member state under rules prescribed by the
21 Commission. The Compact authorizes a member state to take certain adverse actions against a
22 licensed professional counselor practicing within that member state under the Compact. The
23 Compact requires the Commission, among other duties, to: (1) establish bylaws; (2) make
24 rules that facilitate and coordinate implementation and administration of the Compact; (3)
25 hold meetings, which may be closed to the public under certain conditions; (4) develop,
26 maintain and use a coordinated database and reporting system; and (5) resolve disputes related
27 to the Compact among states that are members of the Compact. The Commission is

Assembly Amendment No. 826 to Assembly Bill No. 163 Page 4
28 additionally authorized to levy and collect an annual assessment from each state that is a
29 member of the Compact.
30 Section 2 of this bill authorizes the Board of Examiners for Marriage and Family
31 Therapists and Clinical Professional Counselors to disclose certain investigatory information
32 to the Commission and the coordinated database and reporting system when required by the
33 Compact. Sections 1 and 4 of this bill provide for the confidentiality of certain information
34 disclosed to the Board from the coordinated database and reporting system.
35 Section 3 of this bill deems practicing as a licensed professional counselor under the
36 Compact to be equivalent to practicing as a clinical professional counselor under a license
37 issued by the Board.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 641A of NRS is hereby amended by adding thereto a new
2 section to read as follows:

28 requirements throughout the States to promote public safety and public health
29 benefits;

31 Professional Counselor accountable for meeting all State practice laws in the
32 State in which the client is located at the time care is rendered through the
33 mutual recognition of Member State licenses;

38 the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this Compact or the
39 promulgated Rules, the Commission shall:
40 a. Provide written notice to the defaulting State and other Member
41 States of the nature of the default, the proposed means of curing the default
42 and/or any other action to be taken by the Commission; and
43 b. Provide remedial training and specific technical assistance
44 regarding the default.
45 C. If a State in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting State may be
46 terminated from the Compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the
47 Member States, and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this Compact
48 may be terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does
49 not relieve the offending State of obligations or liabilities incurred during the
50 period of default.
51 D. Termination of membership in the Compact shall be imposed only after
52 all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to
53 suspend or terminate shall be given by the Commission to the governor, the

Assembly Amendment No. 826 to Assembly Bill No. 163 Page 18
1 majority and minority leaders of the defaulting State’s legislature, and each of
2 the Member States.
3 E. A State that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments,
4 obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination,
5 including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of termination.
6 F. The Commission shall not bear any costs related to a State that is found
7 to be in default or that has been terminated from the Compact, unless agreed
8 upon in writing between the Commission and the defaulting State.
9 G. The defaulting State may appeal the action of the Commission by
10 petitioning the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal
11 district where the Commission has its principal offices. The prevailing member
12 shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees.
13 H. Dispute Resolution
14 1. Upon request by a Member State, the Commission shall attempt to
15 resolve disputes related to the Compact that arise among Member States and
16 between member and non-Member States.
17 2. The Commission shall promulgate a Rule providing for both
18 mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.
19 I. Enforcement
20 1. The Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall
21 enforce the provisions and Rules of this Compact.
22 2. By majority vote, the Commission may initiate legal action in the
23 United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district
24 where the Commission has its principal offices against a Member State in default
25 to enforce compliance with the provisions of the Compact and its promulgated
26 Rules and bylaws. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and
27 damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing member
28 shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees.
29 3. The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the
30 Commission. The Commission may pursue any other remedies available under
31 federal or State law.
32

2 withdrawing State’s Professional Counseling Licensing Board to comply with the
3 investigative and Adverse Action reporting requirements of this act prior to the
4 effective date of withdrawal.

6 prevent any Professional Counseling licensure agreement or other cooperative
7 arrangement between a Member State and a non-Member State that does not
8 conflict with the provisions of this Compact.

10 this Compact shall become effective and binding upon any Member State until it

12
13 SECTION 14. CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
14

18 constitution of any Member State or of the United States or the applicability
19 thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the
20 validity of the remainder of this Compact and the applicability thereof to any
21 government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this
22 Compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any Member State, the
23 Compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining Member States
24 and in full force and effect as to the Member State affected as to all severable
25 matters.

34 State that is not inconsistent with the Compact.

43 ineffective to the extent of the conflict with the constitutional provision in
44 question in that Member State.

37 records of a governmental entity must be open at all times during office hours to
38 inspection by any person, and may be fully copied or an abstract or memorandum
39 may be prepared from those public books and public records. Any such copies,
40 abstracts or memoranda may be used to supply the general public with copies,
41 abstracts or memoranda of the records or may be used in any other way to the
42 advantage of the governmental entity or of the general public. This section does not
43 supersede or in any manner affect the federal laws governing copyrights or enlarge,
44 diminish or affect in any other manner the rights of a person in any written book or
45 record which is copyrighted pursuant to federal law.
46 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record which is
47 copyrighted solely because it is copyrighted.
48 3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a public book or
49 record shall not deny a request made pursuant to subsection 1 to inspect or copy or
50 receive a copy of a public book or record on the basis that the requested public
51 book or record contains information that is confidential if the governmental entity
52 can redact, delete, conceal or separate, including, without limitation, electronically,

Assembly Amendment No. 826 to Assembly Bill No. 163 Page 22
1 the confidential information from the information included in the public book or
2 record that is not otherwise confidential.
3 4. If requested, a governmental entity shall provide a copy of a public record
4 in an electronic format by means of an electronic medium. Nothing in this
5 subsection requires a governmental entity to provide a copy of a public record in an
6 electronic format or by means of an electronic medium if:
7 (a) The public record:
8 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
9 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
10 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by means of an
11 electronic medium would:
12 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
13 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential and that
14 cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from information that is not
15 otherwise confidential.
16 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who has legal
17 custody or control of a public record:
18 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the medium that
19 is requested because the officer, employee or agent has already prepared or would
20 prefer to provide the copy in a different medium.
21 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon request, prepare
22 the copy of the public record and shall not require the person who has requested the
23 copy to prepare the copy himself or herself.
24 Sec. 5. This act becomes effective on [July 1, 2025.] January 1, 2026.
