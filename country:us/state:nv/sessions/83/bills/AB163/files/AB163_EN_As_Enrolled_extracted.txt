CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to mental health; ratifying and entering into the
Counseling Compact; authorizing the sharing of certain
information with the coordinated database and reporting
system created by the Compact; providing licensed
professional counselors practicing in this State under the
Compact with the same legal status as clinical professional
counselors who are licensed in this State; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law regulates the practice of licensed professional counselors, known
as clinical professional counselors, in this State. (Chapter 641A of NRS) Section 1
of this bill ratifies and enters into the Counseling Compact, which is an interstate
compact that allows a person who is licensed as a licensed professional counselor in
a state that is a member of the Compact to practice as a licensed professional
counselor in other states that are members of the Compact. In order to practice as a
licensed professional counselor under the Compact, the Compact requires a
licensed professional counselor to: (1) hold a license in his or her home state; (2)
have a valid social security number or National Practitioner Identifier; (3) notify the
Counseling Compact Commission, a joint public agency established by the
Compact, that he or she is seeking to practice under the Compact in another state;
(4) have had no encumbrances or restrictions placed against any license or authority
to practice under the Compact within the previous 2 years; (5) pay any applicable
fees; (6) meet any requirements for continuing education established by his or her
home state; (7) meet any requirement in the state in which he or she seeks to
practice under the Compact to pass an assessment of his or her knowledge of the
applicable laws and rules of that state; and (8) report any adverse action taken
against him or her or any encumbrance or restriction placed upon him or her in a
non-member state within 30 days after the date of the adverse action or the
placement of the encumbrance or restriction, as applicable. The Compact also
requires a member state to authorize a professional counselor who is licensed in a
member state to provide counseling services via telehealth to a patient located in
any member state under rules prescribed by the Commission. The Compact
authorizes a member state to take certain adverse actions against a licensed
professional counselor practicing within that member state under the Compact. The
Compact requires the Commission, among other duties, to: (1) establish bylaws; (2)
make rules that facilitate and coordinate implementation and administration of the
Compact; (3) hold meetings, which may be closed to the public under certain
conditions; (4) develop, maintain and use a coordinated database and reporting
system; and (5) resolve disputes related to the Compact among states that are
members of the Compact. The Commission is additionally authorized to levy and
collect an annual assessment from each state that is a member of the Compact.

Section 2:
Section 2 of this bill authorizes the Board of Examiners for Marriage and
Family Therapists and Clinical Professional Counselors to disclose certain
investigatory information to the Commission and the coordinated database and
reporting system when required by the Compact. Sections 1 and 4 of this bill
provide for the confidentiality of certain information disclosed to the Board from
the coordinated database and reporting system.

State may be terminated from the Compact upon an affirmative
vote of a majority of the Member States, and all rights, privileges
and benefits conferred by this Compact may be terminated on the
effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve
the offending State of obligations or liabilities incurred during the
period of default.

imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have
been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be
given by the Commission to the governor, the majority and

assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the
effective date of termination, including obligations that extend

(2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
(b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by
means of an electronic medium would:

information that is not otherwise confidential.

Section 198:
5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who

Raw Text:
Assembly Bill No. 163–Assemblymember Hafen
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to mental health; ratifying and entering into the
Counseling Compact; authorizing the sharing of certain
information with the coordinated database and reporting
system created by the Compact; providing licensed
professional counselors practicing in this State under the
Compact with the same legal status as clinical professional
counselors who are licensed in this State; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law regulates the practice of licensed professional counselors, known
as clinical professional counselors, in this State. (Chapter 641A of NRS) Section 1
of this bill ratifies and enters into the Counseling Compact, which is an interstate
compact that allows a person who is licensed as a licensed professional counselor in
a state that is a member of the Compact to practice as a licensed professional
counselor in other states that are members of the Compact. In order to practice as a
licensed professional counselor under the Compact, the Compact requires a
licensed professional counselor to: (1) hold a license in his or her home state; (2)
have a valid social security number or National Practitioner Identifier; (3) notify the
Counseling Compact Commission, a joint public agency established by the
Compact, that he or she is seeking to practice under the Compact in another state;
(4) have had no encumbrances or restrictions placed against any license or authority
to practice under the Compact within the previous 2 years; (5) pay any applicable
fees; (6) meet any requirements for continuing education established by his or her
home state; (7) meet any requirement in the state in which he or she seeks to
practice under the Compact to pass an assessment of his or her knowledge of the
applicable laws and rules of that state; and (8) report any adverse action taken
against him or her or any encumbrance or restriction placed upon him or her in a
non-member state within 30 days after the date of the adverse action or the
placement of the encumbrance or restriction, as applicable. The Compact also
requires a member state to authorize a professional counselor who is licensed in a
member state to provide counseling services via telehealth to a patient located in
any member state under rules prescribed by the Commission. The Compact
authorizes a member state to take certain adverse actions against a licensed
professional counselor practicing within that member state under the Compact. The
Compact requires the Commission, among other duties, to: (1) establish bylaws; (2)
make rules that facilitate and coordinate implementation and administration of the
Compact; (3) hold meetings, which may be closed to the public under certain
conditions; (4) develop, maintain and use a coordinated database and reporting
system; and (5) resolve disputes related to the Compact among states that are
members of the Compact. The Commission is additionally authorized to levy and
collect an annual assessment from each state that is a member of the Compact.
Section 2 of this bill authorizes the Board of Examiners for Marriage and
Family Therapists and Clinical Professional Counselors to disclose certain
investigatory information to the Commission and the coordinated database and
reporting system when required by the Compact. Sections 1 and 4 of this bill
provide for the confidentiality of certain information disclosed to the Board from
the coordinated database and reporting system.

Section 3 of this bill deems practicing as a licensed professional counselor
under the Compact to be equivalent to practicing as a clinical professional
counselor under a license issued by the Board.

statutory law.

the Rules in any judicial or administrative proceeding in a
Member State pertaining to the subject matter of this Compact
which may affect the powers, responsibilities, or actions of the

process in any such proceeding and shall have standing to

1. If the Commission determines that a Member State has
defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities
under this Compact or the promulgated Rules, the Commission

-
83rd Session (2025)

State may be terminated from the Compact upon an affirmative
vote of a majority of the Member States, and all rights, privileges
and benefits conferred by this Compact may be terminated on the
effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve
the offending State of obligations or liabilities incurred during the
period of default.
D. Termination of membership in the Compact shall be
imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have
been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be
given by the Commission to the governor, the majority and
minority leaders of the defaulting State’s legislature, and each of
the Member States.
E. A State that has been terminated is responsible for all
assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the
effective date of termination, including obligations that extend
beyond the effective date of termination.

that is found to be in default or that has been terminated from the
Compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the Commission
and the defaulting State.

Commission by petitioning the U.S. District Court for the District
of Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has its
principal offices. The prevailing member shall be awarded all
costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees.

action in the United States District Court for the District of

principal offices against a Member State in default to enforce
compliance with the provisions of the Compact and its
promulgated Rules and bylaws. The relief sought may include
-

– 23 –
both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial
enforcement is necessary, the prevailing member shall be awarded
all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees.

– 28 –
subsection 1 to inspect or copy or receive a copy of a public book or
record on the basis that the requested public book or record contains
information that is confidential if the governmental entity can
redact, delete, conceal or separate, including, without limitation,
electronically, the confidential information from the information
included in the public book or record that is not otherwise
confidential.
4. If requested, a governmental entity shall provide a copy of a
public record in an electronic format by means of an electronic
medium. Nothing in this subsection requires a governmental entity
to provide a copy of a public record in an electronic format or by
means of an electronic medium if:
(a) The public record:
(1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
(2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
(b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by
means of an electronic medium would:
(1) Give access to proprietary software; or
(2) Require the production of information that is confidential
and that cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from
information that is not otherwise confidential.
5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who
has legal custody or control of a public record:
(a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the
medium that is requested because the officer, employee or agent has
already prepared or would prefer to provide the copy in a different
medium.
(b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon
request, prepare the copy of the public record and shall not require
the person who has requested the copy to prepare the copy himself
or herself.
