AN ACT relating to mental health; ratifying and entering into the
Counseling Compact; authorizing the sharing of certain
information with the coordinated database and reporting
system created by the Compact; providing licensed
professional counselors practicing in this State under the
Compact with the same legal status as clinical
professional counselors who are licensed in this State; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law regulates the practice of licensed professional counselors, known
2 as clinical professional counselors, in this State. (Chapter 641A of NRS) Section 1
3 of this bill ratifies and enters into the Counseling Compact, which is an interstate
4 compact that allows a person who is licensed as a licensed professional counselor in
5 a state that is a member of the Compact to practice as a licensed professional
6 counselor in other states that are members of the Compact. In order to practice as a
7 licensed professional counselor under the Compact, the Compact requires a
8 licensed professional counselor to: (1) hold a license in his or her home state; (2)
9 have a valid social security number or National Practitioner Identifier; (3) notify the
10 Counseling Compact Commission, a joint public agency established by the
11 Compact, that he or she is seeking to practice under the Compact in another state;
12 (4) have had no encumbrances or restrictions placed against any license or authority
13 to practice under the Compact within the previous 2 years; (5) pay any applicable
14 fees; (6) meet any requirements for continuing education established by his or her
15 home state; (7) meet any requirement in the state in which he or she seeks to
16 practice under the Compact to pass an assessment of his or her knowledge of the
17 applicable laws and rules of that state; and (8) report any adverse action taken
18 against him or her or any encumbrance or restriction placed upon him or her in a
19 non-member state within 30 days after the date of the adverse action or the
20 placement of the encumbrance or restriction, as applicable. The Compact also
21 requires a member state to authorize a professional counselor who is licensed in a
22 member state to provide counseling services via telehealth to a patient located in
-
*AB163*
– 2 –
23 any member state under rules prescribed by the Commission. The Compact
24 authorizes a member state to take certain adverse actions against a licensed
25 professional counselor practicing within that member state under the Compact. The
26 Compact requires the Commission, among other duties, to: (1) establish bylaws; (2)
27 make rules that facilitate and coordinate implementation and administration of the
28 Compact; (3) hold meetings, which may be closed to the public under certain
29 conditions; (4) develop, maintain and use a coordinated database and reporting
30 system; and (5) resolve disputes related to the Compact among states that are
31 members of the Compact. The Commission is additionally authorized to levy and
32 collect an annual assessment from each state that is a member of the Compact.
33 Section 2 of this bill authorizes the Board of Examiners for Marriage and
34 Family Therapists and Clinical Professional Counselors to disclose certain
35 investigatory information to the Commission and the coordinated database and
36 reporting system when required by the Compact. Sections 1 and 4 of this bill
37 provide for the confidentiality of certain information disclosed to the Board from
38 the coordinated database and reporting system.
39 Section 3 of this bill deems practicing as a licensed professional counselor
40 under the Compact to be equivalent to practicing as a clinical professional
41 counselor under a license issued by the Board.

2 Commission.
3 3. The Commission shall be entitled to receive service of
4 process in any such proceeding and shall have standing to

8 Rules.
9 B. Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination
10 1. If the Commission determines that a Member State has
11 defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities

21 State may be terminated from the Compact upon an affirmative
22 vote of a majority of the Member States, and all rights, privileges

24 effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve
25 the offending State of obligations or liabilities incurred during the
26 period of default.

28 imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have
29 been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be

32 the Member States.

18 both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial
19 enforcement is necessary, the prevailing member shall be awarded
20 all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees.
21 3. The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies
22 of the Commission. The Commission may pursue any other
23 remedies available under federal or State law.

38 entity must be open at all times during office hours to inspection by
39 any person, and may be fully copied or an abstract or memorandum
40 may be prepared from those public books and public records. Any

1 diminish or affect in any other manner the rights of a person in any
2 written book or record which is copyrighted pursuant to federal law.
3 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record
4 which is copyrighted solely because it is copyrighted.
5 3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a
6 public book or record shall not deny a request made pursuant to
7 subsection 1 to inspect or copy or receive a copy of a public book or
8 record on the basis that the requested public book or record contains
9 information that is confidential if the governmental entity can
10 redact, delete, conceal or separate, including, without limitation,
11 electronically, the confidential information from the information
12 included in the public book or record that is not otherwise
13 confidential.
14 4. If requested, a governmental entity shall provide a copy of a
15 public record in an electronic format by means of an electronic
16 medium. Nothing in this subsection requires a governmental entity
17 to provide a copy of a public record in an electronic format or by
18 means of an electronic medium if:
19 (a) The public record:
20 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
21 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
22 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by
23 means of an electronic medium would:
24 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
25 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential
26 and that cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from
27 information that is not otherwise confidential.
28 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who
29 has legal custody or control of a public record:
30 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the
31 medium that is requested because the officer, employee or agent has
32 already prepared or would prefer to provide the copy in a different
33 medium.
34 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon
35 request, prepare the copy of the public record and shall not require
36 the person who has requested the copy to prepare the copy himself
37 or herself.
38 Sec. 5. This act becomes effective on July 1, 2025.

PREFILED JANUARY 31, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Commerce and Labor
SUMMARY—Enters into the Counseling Compact. (BDR 54-129)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to mental health; ratifying and entering into the
Counseling Compact; authorizing the sharing of certain
information with the coordinated database and reporting
system created by the Compact; providing licensed
professional counselors practicing in this State under the
Compact with the same legal status as clinical
professional counselors who are licensed in this State; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law regulates the practice of licensed professional counselors, known
2 as clinical professional counselors, in this State. (Chapter 641A of NRS) Section 1
3 of this bill ratifies and enters into the Counseling Compact, which is an interstate
4 compact that allows a person who is licensed as a licensed professional counselor in
5 a state that is a member of the Compact to practice as a licensed professional
6 counselor in other states that are members of the Compact. In order to practice as a
7 licensed professional counselor under the Compact, the Compact requires a
8 licensed professional counselor to: (1) hold a license in his or her home state; (2)
9 have a valid social security number or National Practitioner Identifier; (3) notify the
10 Counseling Compact Commission, a joint public agency established by the
11 Compact, that he or she is seeking to practice under the Compact in another state;
12 (4) have had no encumbrances or restrictions placed against any license or authority
13 to practice under the Compact within the previous 2 years; (5) pay any applicable
14 fees; (6) meet any requirements for continuing education established by his or her
15 home state; (7) meet any requirement in the state in which he or she seeks to
16 practice under the Compact to pass an assessment of his or her knowledge of the
17 applicable laws and rules of that state; and (8) report any adverse action taken
18 against him or her or any encumbrance or restriction placed upon him or her in a
19 non-member state within 30 days after the date of the adverse action or the
20 placement of the encumbrance or restriction, as applicable. The Compact also
21 requires a member state to authorize a professional counselor who is licensed in a
22 member state to provide counseling services via telehealth to a patient located in
-
*AB163*

– 2 –
23 any member state under rules prescribed by the Commission. The Compact
24 authorizes a member state to take certain adverse actions against a licensed
25 professional counselor practicing within that member state under the Compact. The
26 Compact requires the Commission, among other duties, to: (1) establish bylaws; (2)
27 make rules that facilitate and coordinate implementation and administration of the
28 Compact; (3) hold meetings, which may be closed to the public under certain
29 conditions; (4) develop, maintain and use a coordinated database and reporting
30 system; and (5) resolve disputes related to the Compact among states that are
31 members of the Compact. The Commission is additionally authorized to levy and
32 collect an annual assessment from each state that is a member of the Compact.
33 Section 2 of this bill authorizes the Board of Examiners for Marriage and
34 Family Therapists and Clinical Professional Counselors to disclose certain
35 investigatory information to the Commission and the coordinated database and
36 reporting system when required by the Compact. Sections 1 and 4 of this bill
37 provide for the confidentiality of certain information disclosed to the Board from
38 the coordinated database and reporting system.
39 Section 3 of this bill deems practicing as a licensed professional counselor
40 under the Compact to be equivalent to practicing as a clinical professional
41 counselor under a license issued by the Board.

16 means of curing the default and/or any other action to be taken by
17 the Commission; and
18 b. Provide remedial training and specific technical
19 assistance regarding the default.
20 C. If a State in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting
21 State may be terminated from the Compact upon an affirmative
22 vote of a majority of the Member States, and all rights, privileges
23 and benefits conferred by this Compact may be terminated on the
24 effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve
25 the offending State of obligations or liabilities incurred during the
26 period of default.
27 D. Termination of membership in the Compact shall be
28 imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have
29 been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be
30 given by the Commission to the governor, the majority and
31 minority leaders of the defaulting State’s legislature, and each of
32 the Member States.
33 E. A State that has been terminated is responsible for all
34 assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the
35 effective date of termination, including obligations that extend
36 beyond the effective date of termination.
37 F. The Commission shall not bear any costs related to a State
38 that is found to be in default or that has been terminated from the
39 Compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the Commission
40 and the defaulting State.
41 G. The defaulting State may appeal the action of the
42 Commission by petitioning the U.S. District Court for the District
43 of Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has its
44 principal offices. The prevailing member shall be awarded all
45 costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees.

17 promulgated Rules and bylaws. The relief sought may include
18 both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial
19 enforcement is necessary, the prevailing member shall be awarded
20 all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees.

2 written book or record which is copyrighted pursuant to federal law.
3 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record
4 which is copyrighted solely because it is copyrighted.
5 3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a
6 public book or record shall not deny a request made pursuant to
7 subsection 1 to inspect or copy or receive a copy of a public book or
8 record on the basis that the requested public book or record contains
9 information that is confidential if the governmental entity can

21 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
22 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by
23 means of an electronic medium would:
24 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
25 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential
26 and that cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from
27 information that is not otherwise confidential.
28 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who
29 has legal custody or control of a public record:
30 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the
31 medium that is requested because the officer, employee or agent has
32 already prepared or would prefer to provide the copy in a different
33 medium.
34 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon
35 request, prepare the copy of the public record and shall not require
36 the person who has requested the copy to prepare the copy himself
37 or herself.
