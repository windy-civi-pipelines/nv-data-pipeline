AN ACT relating to education; revising provisions governing the
children who must be served by a prekindergarten

amount awarded for such grants; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes a program, known as Nevada Ready! State Pre K, that
2 requires the Department of Education, to the extent money is available, to award
3 grants of money to school districts, sponsors of charter schools and nonprofit
4 organizations to support prekindergarten programs that meet certain standards.
5 Under existing law, a prekindergarten program that is supported by such a grant is
6 required to satisfy certain requirements concerning the children it serves. (NRS
7 387.652) This bill increases the maximum household income level of the children
8 that must be served by a prekindergarten program supported by such a grant. This
9 bill additionally authorizes a prekindergarten program to qualify to be supported by
10 such a grant by serving children who have a household income below that level or
11 who, regardless of household income level, have: (1) an individualized education
12 program; or (2) a documented need for behavioral, social or emotional supports.
13 Finally, this bill provides that the amount of such a grant is determined by
14 multiplying certain adjusted base per pupil funding amounts by the number of
15 children served by the prekindergarten program.
