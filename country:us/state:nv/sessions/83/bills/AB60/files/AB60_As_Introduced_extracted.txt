Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 In general, existing law requires an adult to be certified as a peer recovery
2 support specialist or peer recovery support specialist supervisor by the Nevada
3 Certification Board or, if that Board ceases issuing such certificates, the Division of
-

– 2 –
4 Public and Behavioral Health of the Department of Health and Human Services, in
5 order to provide peer recovery support services or supervise the provision of such
6 services, as applicable, for compensation as a regular part of his or her job duties.
7 However, existing law authorizes an adult who is not a peer recovery support
8 specialist to provide peer recovery support services as a regular part of his or her
9 job duties while serving as a peer recovery support specialist intern if the Nevada
10 Certification Board or the Division, as applicable, has established conditions
11 authorizing such internships. (NRS 433.631) Section 7 of this bill additionally
12 imposes a general prohibition on a minor providing or supervising the provision of
13 peer recovery support services for compensation as a regular part of his or her job
14 duties. However, section 7 authorizes a minor who is at least 16 years of age to
15 provide such services for compensation as a regular part of his or her job duties
16 while serving as a peer recovery support specialist intern if the Nevada
17 Certification Board or the Division, as applicable, has established conditions
18 authorizing such internships. Sections 7 and 13 of this bill authorize the Division
19 to impose a civil penalty or bring an action for an injunction against a minor who:
20 (1) provides peer recovery support services and is not a peer recovery support
21 specialist intern; or (2) supervises the provision of peer recovery support services.
22 Sections 4-6, 14 and 15 of this bill make various conforming changes to: (1) reflect
23 that the provisions of law governing peer recovery support services apply to both
24 adults and minors; and (2) clarify that those provisions of law apply only to natural
25 persons. Section 25 of this bill repeals a definition that is no longer used, and
26 section 2 of this bill eliminates a reference to that definition.
27 Sections 3, 7 and 8 of this bill prohibit a natural person from holding himself
28 or herself out as a certified prevention specialist unless he or she is certified as such
29 by the Nevada Certification Board or, if that Board ceases to certify certified
30 prevention specialists, peer recovery support specialists or peer recovery support
31 specialist supervisors, the Division. Section 1 of this bill defines “certified
32 prevention specialist” to mean a natural person who: (1) holds such certification;
33 and (2) implements evidence-based programs and other evidence-based
34 interventions in schools or communities to prevent or reduce the harms caused by
35 substance misuse, substance use disorder and other behavioral health disorders or
36 address systemic barriers to wellness. Section 2 of this bill makes conforming
37 changes to indicate the applicability of that definition. Sections 7 and 13 authorize
38 the Division to impose a civil penalty or bring an action for an injunction against a
39 natural person who holds himself or herself out as a certified prevention specialist
40 without being certified as such. Sections 9-12, 14-17 and 19-23 of this bill make
41 various changes so that certified prevention specialists are treated similarly to peer
42 recovery support specialists and peer recovery support specialist supervisors for
43 purposes related to: (1) regulation, certification and background checks; (2)
44 mandatory reporting of certain crimes and violations; and (3) exemption from the
45 applicability of provisions of law governing certain other professions that provide
46 behavioral health services.
47 Existing law: (1) provides for the certification of substance use disorder
48 prevention coalitions; (2) requires a certified substance use disorder prevention
49 coalition to perform certain duties relating to the prevention of substance misuse
50 and substance use disorder; and (3) requires the Division to collaborate with and
51 utilize certified substance use disorder prevention coalitions as the primary local
52 and regional entities to coordinate programs and strategies for the prevention of
53 substance use disorders in this State. (NRS 458.033) Section 18 of this bill requires
54 a substance use disorder prevention coalition to employ or enter into contracts with
55 certified prevention specialists as necessary to perform the duties of the coalition.

REQUIRES TWO-THIRDS MAJORITY VOTE
(§§ 9-11)
A.B. 60
ASSEMBLY BILL NO. 60–COMMITTEE ON
HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES
(ON BEHALF OF THE NORTHERN REGIONAL
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH POLICY BOARD)
PREFILED NOVEMBER 20, 2024
____________
Referred to Committee on Health and Human Services
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to certain behavioral
health services. (BDR 39-434)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to behavioral health; requiring the certification of
a natural person who holds himself or herself out as a
certified prevention specialist; prohibiting a minor from
providing or supervising the provision of peer recovery
support services in most circumstances; authorizing
certain minors to serve as peer recovery support specialist
interns; authorizing the imposition of civil penalties for
certain violations; prohibiting the employment or
retention as an independent contractor of a natural person
to serve as a certified prevention specialist in a position
where the natural person has regular and substantial
contact with minors if the natural person has been found
to have engaged in certain conduct; requiring a certified
prevention specialist to report certain information;
requiring a substance use disorder prevention coalition to
employ or enter into contracts with certified prevention
specialists for certain purposes; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 In general, existing law requires an adult to be certified as a peer recovery
2 support specialist or peer recovery support specialist supervisor by the Nevada
3 Certification Board or, if that Board ceases issuing such certificates, the Division of
-
*AB60*

– 2 –
4 Public and Behavioral Health of the Department of Health and Human Services, in
5 order to provide peer recovery support services or supervise the provision of such
6 services, as applicable, for compensation as a regular part of his or her job duties.
7 However, existing law authorizes an adult who is not a peer recovery support
8 specialist to provide peer recovery support services as a regular part of his or her
9 job duties while serving as a peer recovery support specialist intern if the Nevada
10 Certification Board or the Division, as applicable, has established conditions
11 authorizing such internships. (NRS 433.631) Section 7 of this bill additionally
12 imposes a general prohibition on a minor providing or supervising the provision of
13 peer recovery support services for compensation as a regular part of his or her job
14 duties. However, section 7 authorizes a minor who is at least 16 years of age to
15 provide such services for compensation as a regular part of his or her job duties
16 while serving as a peer recovery support specialist intern if the Nevada
17 Certification Board or the Division, as applicable, has established conditions
18 authorizing such internships. Sections 7 and 13 of this bill authorize the Division
19 to impose a civil penalty or bring an action for an injunction against a minor who:
20 (1) provides peer recovery support services and is not a peer recovery support
21 specialist intern; or (2) supervises the provision of peer recovery support services.
22 Sections 4-6, 14 and 15 of this bill make various conforming changes to: (1) reflect
23 that the provisions of law governing peer recovery support services apply to both
24 adults and minors; and (2) clarify that those provisions of law apply only to natural
25 persons. Section 25 of this bill repeals a definition that is no longer used, and
26 section 2 of this bill eliminates a reference to that definition.
27 Sections 3, 7 and 8 of this bill prohibit a natural person from holding himself
28 or herself out as a certified prevention specialist unless he or she is certified as such
29 by the Nevada Certification Board or, if that Board ceases to certify certified
30 prevention specialists, peer recovery support specialists or peer recovery support
31 specialist supervisors, the Division. Section 1 of this bill defines “certified
32 prevention specialist” to mean a natural person who: (1) holds such certification;
33 and (2) implements evidence-based programs and other evidence-based
34 interventions in schools or communities to prevent or reduce the harms caused by
35 substance misuse, substance use disorder and other behavioral health disorders or
36 address systemic barriers to wellness. Section 2 of this bill makes conforming
37 changes to indicate the applicability of that definition. Sections 7 and 13 authorize
38 the Division to impose a civil penalty or bring an action for an injunction against a
39 natural person who holds himself or herself out as a certified prevention specialist
40 without being certified as such. Sections 9-12, 14-17 and 19-23 of this bill make
41 various changes so that certified prevention specialists are treated similarly to peer
42 recovery support specialists and peer recovery support specialist supervisors for
43 purposes related to: (1) regulation, certification and background checks; (2)
44 mandatory reporting of certain crimes and violations; and (3) exemption from the
45 applicability of provisions of law governing certain other professions that provide
46 behavioral health services.
47 Existing law: (1) provides for the certification of substance use disorder
48 prevention coalitions; (2) requires a certified substance use disorder prevention
49 coalition to perform certain duties relating to the prevention of substance misuse
50 and substance use disorder; and (3) requires the Division to collaborate with and
51 utilize certified substance use disorder prevention coalitions as the primary local
52 and regional entities to coordinate programs and strategies for the prevention of
53 substance use disorders in this State. (NRS 458.033) Section 18 of this bill requires
54 a substance use disorder prevention coalition to employ or enter into contracts with
55 certified prevention specialists as necessary to perform the duties of the coalition.
