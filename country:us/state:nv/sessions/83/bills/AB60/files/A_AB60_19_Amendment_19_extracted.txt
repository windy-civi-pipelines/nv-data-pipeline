EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to behavioral health; requiring the certification of a natural person
who holds himself or herself out as a certified prevention specialist;
prohibiting a minor from providing or supervising the provision of peer
recovery support services ; [in most circumstances; authorizing certain
minors to serve as peer recovery support specialist interns;] authorizing
the imposition of civil penalties for certain violations; prohibiting the
employment or retention as an independent contractor of a natural
person to serve as a certified prevention specialist in a position where
the natural person has regular and substantial contact with minors if the
natural person has been found to have engaged in certain conduct;
requiring a certified prevention specialist to report certain information;
requiring a substance use disorder prevention coalition to employ or
enter into contracts with certified prevention specialists for certain
purposes; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 In general, existing law requires an adult to be certified as a peer recovery support
2 specialist or peer recovery support specialist supervisor by the Nevada Certification Board or,
3 if that Board ceases issuing such certificates, the Division of Public and Behavioral Health of
4 the Department of Health and Human Services, in order to provide peer recovery support
5 services or supervise the provision of such services, as applicable, for compensation as a
6 regular part of his or her job duties. However, existing law authorizes an adult who is not a
7 peer recovery support specialist to provide peer recovery support services as a regular part of
8 his or her job duties while serving as a peer recovery support specialist intern if the Nevada
9 Certification Board or the Division, as applicable, has established conditions authorizing such
10 internships. (NRS 433.631) Section 7 of this bill additionally [imposes a general prohibition
11 on] prohibits a minor from providing or supervising the provision of peer recovery support
12 services for compensation as a regular part of his or her job duties. [However, section 7
Assembly Amendment No. 19 to Assembly Bill No. 60 Page 4
13 authorizes a minor who is at least 16 years of age to provide such services for compensation
14 as a regular part of his or her job duties while serving as a peer recovery support specialist
15 intern if the Nevada Certification Board or the Division, as applicable, has established
16 conditions authorizing such internships.] Sections 7 , 8 and 13 of this bill authorize the
17 Division to impose a civil penalty or bring an action for an injunction against a minor who: (1)
18 provides peer recovery support services ; [and is not a peer recovery support specialist intern;]
19 or (2) supervises the provision of peer recovery support services. Sections 4-6, 14 and 15 of
20 this bill make various conforming changes to: (1) reflect that the provisions of law governing
21 peer recovery support services apply to both adults and minors; and (2) clarify that those
22 provisions of law apply only to natural persons. Section 25 of this bill repeals a definition that
23 is no longer used, and section 2 of this bill eliminates a reference to that definition.
24 Sections 3, 7 and 8 of this bill prohibit a natural person from holding himself or herself
25 out as a certified prevention specialist unless he or she is certified as such by the Nevada
26 Certification Board or, if that Board ceases to certify certified prevention specialists, peer
27 recovery support specialists or peer recovery support specialist supervisors, the Division.
28 Section 1 of this bill defines “certified prevention specialist” to mean a natural person who:
29 (1) holds such certification; and (2) supervises, reviews and implements evidence-based
30 programs , policies, practices and other [evidence-based] culturally relevant interventions in
31 schools or communities to prevent or reduce the harms caused by substance [misuse,] use,
32 substance use disorder and other behavioral health disorders or address systemic barriers to
33 wellness. Section 2 of this bill makes conforming changes to indicate the applicability of that
34 definition. Sections 7 and 13 authorize the Division to impose a civil penalty or bring an
35 action for an injunction against a natural person who holds himself or herself out as a certified
36 prevention specialist without being certified as such. Sections 9-12, 14-17 and 19-23 of this
37 bill make various changes so that certified prevention specialists are treated similarly to peer
38 recovery support specialists and peer recovery support specialist supervisors for purposes
39 related to: (1) regulation, certification and background checks; (2) mandatory reporting of
40 certain crimes and violations; and (3) exemption from the applicability of provisions of law
41 governing certain other professions that provide behavioral health services.
42 Existing law: (1) provides for the certification of substance use disorder prevention
43 coalitions; (2) requires a certified substance use disorder prevention coalition to perform
44 certain duties relating to the prevention of substance misuse and substance use disorder; and
45 (3) requires the Division to collaborate with and utilize certified substance use disorder
46 prevention coalitions as the primary local and regional entities to coordinate programs and
47 strategies for the prevention of substance use disorders in this State. (NRS 458.033) Section
48 18 of this bill requires a substance use disorder prevention coalition to employ or enter into
49 contracts with certified prevention specialists as necessary to perform the duties of the
50 coalition.

HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES
(ON BEHALF OF THE NORTHERN REGIONAL
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH POLICY BOARD)
PREFILED NOVEMBER 20, 2024
_______________
Referred to Committee on Health and Human Services
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to certain behavioral health services.
(BDR 39-434)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to behavioral health; requiring the certification of a natural person
who holds himself or herself out as a certified prevention specialist;
prohibiting a minor from providing or supervising the provision of peer
recovery support services ; [in most circumstances; authorizing certain
minors to serve as peer recovery support specialist interns;] authorizing
the imposition of civil penalties for certain violations; prohibiting the
employment or retention as an independent contractor of a natural
person to serve as a certified prevention specialist in a position where
the natural person has regular and substantial contact with minors if the
natural person has been found to have engaged in certain conduct;
requiring a certified prevention specialist to report certain information;
requiring a substance use disorder prevention coalition to employ or
enter into contracts with certified prevention specialists for certain
purposes; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 In general, existing law requires an adult to be certified as a peer recovery support
2 specialist or peer recovery support specialist supervisor by the Nevada Certification Board or,
3 if that Board ceases issuing such certificates, the Division of Public and Behavioral Health of
4 the Department of Health and Human Services, in order to provide peer recovery support
5 services or supervise the provision of such services, as applicable, for compensation as a
6 regular part of his or her job duties. However, existing law authorizes an adult who is not a
7 peer recovery support specialist to provide peer recovery support services as a regular part of
8 his or her job duties while serving as a peer recovery support specialist intern if the Nevada
9 Certification Board or the Division, as applicable, has established conditions authorizing such
10 internships. (NRS 433.631) Section 7 of this bill additionally [imposes a general prohibition
11 on] prohibits a minor from providing or supervising the provision of peer recovery support
12 services for compensation as a regular part of his or her job duties. [However, section 7

Assembly Amendment No. 19 to Assembly Bill No. 60 Page 4
13 authorizes a minor who is at least 16 years of age to provide such services for compensation
14 as a regular part of his or her job duties while serving as a peer recovery support specialist
15 intern if the Nevada Certification Board or the Division, as applicable, has established
16 conditions authorizing such internships.] Sections 7 , 8 and 13 of this bill authorize the
17 Division to impose a civil penalty or bring an action for an injunction against a minor who: (1)
18 provides peer recovery support services ; [and is not a peer recovery support specialist intern;]
19 or (2) supervises the provision of peer recovery support services. Sections 4-6, 14 and 15 of
20 this bill make various conforming changes to: (1) reflect that the provisions of law governing
21 peer recovery support services apply to both adults and minors; and (2) clarify that those
22 provisions of law apply only to natural persons. Section 25 of this bill repeals a definition that
23 is no longer used, and section 2 of this bill eliminates a reference to that definition.
24 Sections 3, 7 and 8 of this bill prohibit a natural person from holding himself or herself
25 out as a certified prevention specialist unless he or she is certified as such by the Nevada
26 Certification Board or, if that Board ceases to certify certified prevention specialists, peer
27 recovery support specialists or peer recovery support specialist supervisors, the Division.
28 Section 1 of this bill defines “certified prevention specialist” to mean a natural person who:
29 (1) holds such certification; and (2) supervises, reviews and implements evidence-based
30 programs , policies, practices and other [evidence-based] culturally relevant interventions in
31 schools or communities to prevent or reduce the harms caused by substance [misuse,] use,
32 substance use disorder and other behavioral health disorders or address systemic barriers to
33 wellness. Section 2 of this bill makes conforming changes to indicate the applicability of that
34 definition. Sections 7 and 13 authorize the Division to impose a civil penalty or bring an
35 action for an injunction against a natural person who holds himself or herself out as a certified
36 prevention specialist without being certified as such. Sections 9-12, 14-17 and 19-23 of this
37 bill make various changes so that certified prevention specialists are treated similarly to peer
38 recovery support specialists and peer recovery support specialist supervisors for purposes
39 related to: (1) regulation, certification and background checks; (2) mandatory reporting of
40 certain crimes and violations; and (3) exemption from the applicability of provisions of law
41 governing certain other professions that provide behavioral health services.
42 Existing law: (1) provides for the certification of substance use disorder prevention
43 coalitions; (2) requires a certified substance use disorder prevention coalition to perform
44 certain duties relating to the prevention of substance misuse and substance use disorder; and
45 (3) requires the Division to collaborate with and utilize certified substance use disorder
46 prevention coalitions as the primary local and regional entities to coordinate programs and
47 strategies for the prevention of substance use disorders in this State. (NRS 458.033) Section
48 18 of this bill requires a substance use disorder prevention coalition to employ or enter into
49 contracts with certified prevention specialists as necessary to perform the duties of the
50 coalition.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 433 of NRS is hereby amended by adding thereto a new
2 section to read as follows:
