AN ACT relating to behavioral health; requiring the certification of a natural person
who holds himself or herself out as a certified prevention specialist;
prohibiting a minor from providing or supervising the provision of peer
recovery support services; authorizing the imposition of civil penalties
for certain violations; prohibiting the employment or retention as an
independent contractor of a natural person to serve as a certified
prevention specialist in a position where the natural person has regular
and substantial contact with minors if the natural person has been
found to have engaged in certain conduct; requiring a certified
prevention specialist to report certain information; requiring a
substance use disorder prevention coalition to employ or enter into
contracts with certified prevention specialists for certain purposes; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 In general, existing law requires an adult to be certified as a peer recovery support
2 specialist or peer recovery support specialist supervisor by the Nevada Certification Board or,
3 if that Board ceases issuing such certificates, the Division of Public and Behavioral Health of
4 the Department of Health and Human Services, in order to provide peer recovery support
5 services or supervise the provision of such services, as applicable, for compensation as a
6 regular part of his or her job duties. However, existing law authorizes an adult who is not a
7 peer recovery support specialist to provide peer recovery support services as a regular part of
8 his or her job duties while serving as a peer recovery support specialist intern if the Nevada
9 Certification Board or the Division, as applicable, has established conditions authorizing such
10 internships. (NRS 433.631) Section 7 of this bill additionally prohibits a minor from
11 providing or supervising the provision of peer recovery support services for compensation as a
12 regular part of his or her job duties. Sections 7, 8 and 13 of this bill authorize the Division to
13 impose a civil penalty or bring an action for an injunction against a minor who: (1) provides
14 peer recovery support services; or (2) supervises the provision of peer recovery support
Senate Amendment No. 588 to Assembly Bill No. 60 First Reprint Page 4
15 services. Sections 4-6, 14 and 15 of this bill make various conforming changes to: (1) reflect
16 that the provisions of law governing peer recovery support services apply to both adults and
17 minors; and (2) clarify that those provisions of law apply only to natural persons. Section 25
18 of this bill repeals a definition that is no longer used, and section 2 of this bill eliminates a
19 reference to that definition.
20 Sections 3, 7 and 8 of this bill prohibit a natural person from holding himself or herself
21 out as a certified prevention specialist unless he or she is certified as such by the Nevada
22 Certification Board or, if that Board ceases to certify certified prevention specialists, peer
23 recovery support specialists or peer recovery support specialist supervisors, the Division.
24 Section 1 of this bill defines “certified prevention specialist” to mean a natural person who:
25 (1) holds such certification; and (2) supervises, reviews and implements evidence-based
26 programs, policies, practices and other culturally relevant interventions in schools or
27 communities to prevent or reduce the harms caused by substance use, substance use disorder
28 and other behavioral health disorders or address systemic barriers to wellness. Section 2 of
29 this bill makes conforming changes to indicate the applicability of that definition. Sections 7
30 and 13 authorize the Division to impose a civil penalty or bring an action for an injunction
31 against a natural person who holds himself or herself out as a certified prevention specialist
32 without being certified as such. Sections 9-12, 14-17 and 19-23 of this bill make various
33 changes so that certified prevention specialists are treated similarly to peer recovery support
34 specialists and peer recovery support specialist supervisors for purposes related to: (1)
35 regulation, certification and background checks; (2) mandatory reporting of certain crimes and
36 violations; and (3) exemption from the applicability of provisions of law governing certain
37 other professions that provide behavioral health services.
38 Existing law: (1) provides for the certification of substance use disorder prevention
39 coalitions; (2) requires a certified substance use disorder prevention coalition to perform
40 certain duties relating to the prevention of substance misuse and substance use disorder; and
41 (3) requires the Division to collaborate with and utilize certified substance use disorder
42 prevention coalitions as the primary local and regional entities to coordinate programs and
43 strategies for the prevention of substance use disorders in this State. (NRS 458.033) Section
44 18 of this bill requires a substance use disorder prevention coalition to employ or enter into
45 contracts with certified prevention specialists as necessary to perform the duties of the
46 coalition.

(ON BEHALF OF THE NORTHERN REGIONAL

PREFILED NOVEMBER 20, 2024
_______________
Referred to Committee on Health and Human Services
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to certain behavioral health services.
(BDR 39-434)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to behavioral health; requiring the certification of a natural person
who holds himself or herself out as a certified prevention specialist;
prohibiting a minor from providing or supervising the provision of peer
recovery support services; authorizing the imposition of civil penalties
for certain violations; prohibiting the employment or retention as an
independent contractor of a natural person to serve as a certified
prevention specialist in a position where the natural person has regular
and substantial contact with minors if the natural person has been
found to have engaged in certain conduct; requiring a certified
prevention specialist to report certain information; requiring a
substance use disorder prevention coalition to employ or enter into
contracts with certified prevention specialists for certain purposes; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 In general, existing law requires an adult to be certified as a peer recovery support
2 specialist or peer recovery support specialist supervisor by the Nevada Certification Board or,
3 if that Board ceases issuing such certificates, the Division of Public and Behavioral Health of
4 the Department of Health and Human Services, in order to provide peer recovery support
5 services or supervise the provision of such services, as applicable, for compensation as a
6 regular part of his or her job duties. However, existing law authorizes an adult who is not a
7 peer recovery support specialist to provide peer recovery support services as a regular part of
8 his or her job duties while serving as a peer recovery support specialist intern if the Nevada
9 Certification Board or the Division, as applicable, has established conditions authorizing such
10 internships. (NRS 433.631) Section 7 of this bill additionally prohibits a minor from
11 providing or supervising the provision of peer recovery support services for compensation as a
12 regular part of his or her job duties. Sections 7, 8 and 13 of this bill authorize the Division to
13 impose a civil penalty or bring an action for an injunction against a minor who: (1) provides
14 peer recovery support services; or (2) supervises the provision of peer recovery support

Senate Amendment No. 588 to Assembly Bill No. 60 First Reprint Page 4
15 services. Sections 4-6, 14 and 15 of this bill make various conforming changes to: (1) reflect
16 that the provisions of law governing peer recovery support services apply to both adults and
17 minors; and (2) clarify that those provisions of law apply only to natural persons. Section 25
18 of this bill repeals a definition that is no longer used, and section 2 of this bill eliminates a
19 reference to that definition.
20 Sections 3, 7 and 8 of this bill prohibit a natural person from holding himself or herself
21 out as a certified prevention specialist unless he or she is certified as such by the Nevada
22 Certification Board or, if that Board ceases to certify certified prevention specialists, peer
23 recovery support specialists or peer recovery support specialist supervisors, the Division.
24 Section 1 of this bill defines “certified prevention specialist” to mean a natural person who:
25 (1) holds such certification; and (2) supervises, reviews and implements evidence-based
26 programs, policies, practices and other culturally relevant interventions in schools or
27 communities to prevent or reduce the harms caused by substance use, substance use disorder
28 and other behavioral health disorders or address systemic barriers to wellness. Section 2 of
29 this bill makes conforming changes to indicate the applicability of that definition. Sections 7
30 and 13 authorize the Division to impose a civil penalty or bring an action for an injunction
31 against a natural person who holds himself or herself out as a certified prevention specialist
32 without being certified as such. Sections 9-12, 14-17 and 19-23 of this bill make various
33 changes so that certified prevention specialists are treated similarly to peer recovery support
34 specialists and peer recovery support specialist supervisors for purposes related to: (1)
35 regulation, certification and background checks; (2) mandatory reporting of certain crimes and
36 violations; and (3) exemption from the applicability of provisions of law governing certain
37 other professions that provide behavioral health services.
38 Existing law: (1) provides for the certification of substance use disorder prevention
39 coalitions; (2) requires a certified substance use disorder prevention coalition to perform
40 certain duties relating to the prevention of substance misuse and substance use disorder; and
41 (3) requires the Division to collaborate with and utilize certified substance use disorder
42 prevention coalitions as the primary local and regional entities to coordinate programs and
43 strategies for the prevention of substance use disorders in this State. (NRS 458.033) Section
44 18 of this bill requires a substance use disorder prevention coalition to employ or enter into
45 contracts with certified prevention specialists as necessary to perform the duties of the
46 coalition.
