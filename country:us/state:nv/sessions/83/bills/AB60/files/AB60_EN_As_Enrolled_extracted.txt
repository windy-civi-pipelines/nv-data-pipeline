Health and Human Services
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to behavioral health; requiring the certification of
a natural person who holds himself or herself out as a
certified prevention specialist; prohibiting a minor from
providing or supervising the provision of peer recovery
support services; authorizing the imposition of civil penalties
for certain violations; prohibiting the employment or
retention as an independent contractor of a natural person to
serve as a certified prevention specialist in a position where
the natural person has regular and substantial contact with
minors if the natural person has been found to have engaged
in certain conduct; requiring a certified prevention specialist
to report certain information; requiring a substance use
disorder prevention coalition to employ or enter into
contracts with certified prevention specialists for certain
purposes; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
In general, existing law requires an adult to be certified as a peer recovery
support specialist or peer recovery support specialist supervisor by the Nevada
Certification Board or, if that Board ceases issuing such certificates, the Division of
Public and Behavioral Health of the Department of Health and Human Services, in
order to provide peer recovery support services or supervise the provision of such
services, as applicable, for compensation as a regular part of his or her job duties.
However, existing law authorizes an adult who is not a peer recovery support
specialist to provide peer recovery support services as a regular part of his or her
job duties while serving as a peer recovery support specialist intern if the Nevada
Certification Board or the Division, as applicable, has established conditions
authorizing such internships. (NRS 433.631) Section 7 of this bill additionally
prohibits a minor from providing or supervising the provision of peer recovery
support services for compensation as a regular part of his or her job duties. Sections
7, 8 and 13 of this bill authorize the Division to impose a civil penalty or bring an
action for an injunction against a minor who: (1) provides peer recovery support
services; or (2) supervises the provision of peer recovery support services. Sections
4-6, 14 and 15 of this bill make various conforming changes to: (1) reflect that the
provisions of law governing peer recovery support services apply to both adults and
minors; and (2) clarify that those provisions of law apply only to natural persons.

Section 2:
Section 25 of this bill repeals a definition that is no longer used, and section 2 of
this bill eliminates a reference to that definition.

Section 3:
Sections 3, 7 and 8 of this bill prohibit a natural person from holding himself
or herself out as a certified prevention specialist unless he or she is certified as such
by the Nevada Certification Board or, if that Board ceases to certify certified
prevention specialists, peer recovery support specialists or peer recovery support
specialist supervisors, the Division. Section 1 of this bill defines “certified
prevention specialist” to mean a natural person who: (1) holds such certification;
and (2) supervises, reviews and implements evidence-based programs, policies,
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 2 –
practices and other culturally relevant interventions in schools or communities to
prevent or reduce the harms caused by substance use, substance use disorder and
other behavioral health disorders or address systemic barriers to wellness. Section 2
of this bill makes conforming changes to indicate the applicability of that
definition. Sections 7 and 13 authorize the Division to impose a civil penalty or
bring an action for an injunction against a natural person who holds himself or
herself out as a certified prevention specialist without being certified as such.

Section 4:
Sections 9-12, 14-17 and 19-23 of this bill make various changes so that certified
prevention specialists are treated similarly to peer recovery support specialists and
peer recovery support specialist supervisors for purposes related to: (1) regulation,
certification and background checks; (2) mandatory reporting of certain crimes and
violations; and (3) exemption from the applicability of provisions of law governing
certain other professions that provide behavioral health services.
Existing law: (1) provides for the certification of substance use disorder
prevention coalitions; (2) requires a certified substance use disorder prevention
coalition to perform certain duties relating to the prevention of substance misuse
and substance use disorder; and (3) requires the Division to collaborate with and
utilize certified substance use disorder prevention coalitions as the primary local
and regional entities to coordinate programs and strategies for the prevention of
substance use disorders in this State. (NRS 458.033) Section 18 of this bill requires
a substance use disorder prevention coalition to employ or enter into contracts with
certified prevention specialists as necessary to perform the duties of the coalition.

Assembly Bill No. 60–Committee on
Health and Human Services
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to behavioral health; requiring the certification of
a natural person who holds himself or herself out as a
certified prevention specialist; prohibiting a minor from
providing or supervising the provision of peer recovery
support services; authorizing the imposition of civil penalties
for certain violations; prohibiting the employment or
retention as an independent contractor of a natural person to
serve as a certified prevention specialist in a position where
the natural person has regular and substantial contact with
minors if the natural person has been found to have engaged
in certain conduct; requiring a certified prevention specialist
to report certain information; requiring a substance use
disorder prevention coalition to employ or enter into
contracts with certified prevention specialists for certain
purposes; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
In general, existing law requires an adult to be certified as a peer recovery
support specialist or peer recovery support specialist supervisor by the Nevada
Certification Board or, if that Board ceases issuing such certificates, the Division of
Public and Behavioral Health of the Department of Health and Human Services, in
order to provide peer recovery support services or supervise the provision of such
services, as applicable, for compensation as a regular part of his or her job duties.
However, existing law authorizes an adult who is not a peer recovery support
specialist to provide peer recovery support services as a regular part of his or her
job duties while serving as a peer recovery support specialist intern if the Nevada
Certification Board or the Division, as applicable, has established conditions
authorizing such internships. (NRS 433.631) Section 7 of this bill additionally
prohibits a minor from providing or supervising the provision of peer recovery
support services for compensation as a regular part of his or her job duties. Sections
7, 8 and 13 of this bill authorize the Division to impose a civil penalty or bring an
action for an injunction against a minor who: (1) provides peer recovery support
services; or (2) supervises the provision of peer recovery support services. Sections
4-6, 14 and 15 of this bill make various conforming changes to: (1) reflect that the
provisions of law governing peer recovery support services apply to both adults and
minors; and (2) clarify that those provisions of law apply only to natural persons.
Section 25 of this bill repeals a definition that is no longer used, and section 2 of
this bill eliminates a reference to that definition.
Sections 3, 7 and 8 of this bill prohibit a natural person from holding himself
or herself out as a certified prevention specialist unless he or she is certified as such
by the Nevada Certification Board or, if that Board ceases to certify certified
prevention specialists, peer recovery support specialists or peer recovery support
specialist supervisors, the Division. Section 1 of this bill defines “certified
prevention specialist” to mean a natural person who: (1) holds such certification;
and (2) supervises, reviews and implements evidence-based programs, policies,
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 2 –
practices and other culturally relevant interventions in schools or communities to
prevent or reduce the harms caused by substance use, substance use disorder and
other behavioral health disorders or address systemic barriers to wellness. Section 2
of this bill makes conforming changes to indicate the applicability of that
definition. Sections 7 and 13 authorize the Division to impose a civil penalty or
bring an action for an injunction against a natural person who holds himself or
herself out as a certified prevention specialist without being certified as such.
Sections 9-12, 14-17 and 19-23 of this bill make various changes so that certified
prevention specialists are treated similarly to peer recovery support specialists and
peer recovery support specialist supervisors for purposes related to: (1) regulation,
certification and background checks; (2) mandatory reporting of certain crimes and
violations; and (3) exemption from the applicability of provisions of law governing
certain other professions that provide behavioral health services.
Existing law: (1) provides for the certification of substance use disorder
prevention coalitions; (2) requires a certified substance use disorder prevention
coalition to perform certain duties relating to the prevention of substance misuse
and substance use disorder; and (3) requires the Division to collaborate with and
utilize certified substance use disorder prevention coalitions as the primary local
and regional entities to coordinate programs and strategies for the prevention of
substance use disorders in this State. (NRS 458.033) Section 18 of this bill requires
a substance use disorder prevention coalition to employ or enter into contracts with
certified prevention specialists as necessary to perform the duties of the coalition.
