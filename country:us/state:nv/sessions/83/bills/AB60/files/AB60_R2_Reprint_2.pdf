providing or supervising the provision of peer recovery
support services; authorizing the imposition of civil

information; requiring a substance use disorder prevention

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 In general, existing law requires an adult to be certified as a peer recovery
2 support specialist or peer recovery support specialist supervisor by the Nevada
3 Certification Board or, if that Board ceases issuing such certificates, the Division of
4 Public and Behavioral Health of the Department of Health and Human Services, in
5 order to provide peer recovery support services or supervise the provision of such
-
*AB60_R2*

– 2 –
6 services, as applicable, for compensation as a regular part of his or her job duties.
7 However, existing law authorizes an adult who is not a peer recovery support
8 specialist to provide peer recovery support services as a regular part of his or her
9 job duties while serving as a peer recovery support specialist intern if the Nevada
10 Certification Board or the Division, as applicable, has established conditions
11 authorizing such internships. (NRS 433.631) Section 7 of this bill additionally
12 prohibits a minor from providing or supervising the provision of peer recovery
13 support services for compensation as a regular part of his or her job duties. Sections
14 7, 8 and 13 of this bill authorize the Division to impose a civil penalty or bring an
15 action for an injunction against a minor who: (1) provides peer recovery support
16 services; or (2) supervises the provision of peer recovery support services. Sections
17 4-6, 14 and 15 of this bill make various conforming changes to: (1) reflect that the
18 provisions of law governing peer recovery support services apply to both adults and
19 minors; and (2) clarify that those provisions of law apply only to natural persons.
20 Section 25 of this bill repeals a definition that is no longer used, and section 2 of
21 this bill eliminates a reference to that definition.
22 Sections 3, 7 and 8 of this bill prohibit a natural person from holding himself
23 or herself out as a certified prevention specialist unless he or she is certified as such
24 by the Nevada Certification Board or, if that Board ceases to certify certified
25 prevention specialists, peer recovery support specialists or peer recovery support
26 specialist supervisors, the Division. Section 1 of this bill defines “certified
27 prevention specialist” to mean a natural person who: (1) holds such certification;
28 and (2) supervises, reviews and implements evidence-based programs, policies,
29 practices and other culturally relevant interventions in schools or communities to
30 prevent or reduce the harms caused by substance use, substance use disorder and
31 other behavioral health disorders or address systemic barriers to wellness. Section 2
32 of this bill makes conforming changes to indicate the applicability of that
33 definition. Sections 7 and 13 authorize the Division to impose a civil penalty or
34 bring an action for an injunction against a natural person who holds himself or
35 herself out as a certified prevention specialist without being certified as such.
36 Sections 9-12, 14-17 and 19-23 of this bill make various changes so that certified
37 prevention specialists are treated similarly to peer recovery support specialists and
38 peer recovery support specialist supervisors for purposes related to: (1) regulation,
39 certification and background checks; (2) mandatory reporting of certain crimes and
40 violations; and (3) exemption from the applicability of provisions of law governing
41 certain other professions that provide behavioral health services.
42 Existing law: (1) provides for the certification of substance use disorder
43 prevention coalitions; (2) requires a certified substance use disorder prevention
44 coalition to perform certain duties relating to the prevention of substance misuse
45 and substance use disorder; and (3) requires the Division to collaborate with and
46 utilize certified substance use disorder prevention coalitions as the primary local
47 and regional entities to coordinate programs and strategies for the prevention of
48 substance use disorders in this State. (NRS 458.033) Section 18 of this bill requires
49 a substance use disorder prevention coalition to employ or enter into contracts with
50 certified prevention specialists as necessary to perform the duties of the coalition.
