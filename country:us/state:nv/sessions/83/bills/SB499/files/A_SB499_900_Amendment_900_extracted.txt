SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to state financial administration.
(BDR 26-1237)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Contains Appropriation not included in
Executive Budget.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to state financial administration; revising provisions relating to
the lease of residential property owned by this State to state officers
and employees; authorizing a temporary advance from the State
General Fund for expenses relating to fire suppression and emergency
response in certain circumstances; creating the Out-of-State Fire
Suppression Account; revising provisions relating to the Division of
Forestry Account; making an appropriation; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the Administrator of the Division of State Lands of the State
2 Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, as ex officio State Land Registrar, to
3 lease residential property owned by this State for less than the fair market value of the
4 property to a state officer or employee who is required as a condition of his or her
5 employment to reside in state-owned residential property. (NRS 322.063) Section 1 of this
6 bill expands this authority to allow the lease of state-owned residential property at less than
7 fair market value to a state officer or employee if a state agency that manages state-owned
8 residential property determines that it is beneficial to the State of Nevada for the state officer
9 or employee to reside in the property. Section 1 also requires a state agency that manages
10 state-owned residential property to account separately for the rent collected from such leases
11 and use the money only for the operation and maintenance of state-owned residential property
12 that is managed by the state agency. Section 1 provides that the remaining balance of money
13 collected from such rent does not revert to the State General Fund at the end of a fiscal year
14 and is required to be carried forward to the next fiscal year.
15 Existing law authorizes temporary advances from the State General Fund to specified
16 state agencies for certain delays in the receipt of revenue or for certain emergencies. (NRS
17 353.3463-353.361) During the 2023-2025 biennium, the Director of the State Department of
18 Conservation and Natural Resources was authorized to request a temporary advance from the
19 State General Fund to pay authorized expenses incurred by the Department in the suppression
20 of fires or in response to emergencies for which there was a delay in the receipt of revenue for
21 services billed to the Federal Government, local governments and other state governments.
22 (Section 71 of chapter 209, Statutes of Nevada 2023, at page 1253) Section 2 of this bill
23 codifies in the Nevada Revised Statutes the authority for the Department to request such a
24 temporary advance.
Assembly Amendment No. 900 to Senate Bill No. 499 Page 4
25 Under existing law, the executive head of the Division of Forestry of the State
26 Department of Conservation and Natural Resources is the State Forester Firewarden. (NRS
27 232.120) Existing law charges the State Forester Firewarden with overseeing various fire
28 protection activities for the State. (Chapter 472 of NRS) Section 3 of this bill creates the Out-
29 of-State Fire Suppression Account in the State General Fund for the payment of the costs
30 incurred by the State of Nevada for response to out-of-state fires and emergencies and for the
31 receipt of reimbursement for those costs. Section 3: (1) requires that the State Forester
32 Firewarden administer the Out-of-State Fire Suppression Account; and (2) provides that
33 money remaining in that Account at the end of a fiscal year does not revert to the State
34 General Fund and is carried forward to the next fiscal year. Section 5 of this bill appropriates
35 [$10,000,000] $27,359,038 from the State General Fund to the Out-of-State Fire Suppression
36 Account created by section 3.
37 Existing law creates the Division of Forestry Account in the State General Fund for the
38 receipt of: (1) certain money received from the operation of a conservation camp or from the
39 assignment of any crew of a conservation camp; (2) any federal money allotted to the State of
40 Nevada under the terms of certain federal agreements and such other money as may be
41 received by the State for the management and protection of forests, rangelands and watershed
42 areas; and (3) money received by the Division related to the provisions governing the control
43 of forest insects and diseases. (NRS 209.231, 472.050, 527.230) Existing law also: (1)
44 requires the placement on a list of fully protected species any species or subspecies of native
45 flora that is declared to be threatened by extinction; and (2) prohibits the removal or
46 destruction of any such species or subspecies except under a special permit issued by the State
47 Forester Firewarden. (NRS 527.270) Section 4 of this bill requires the deposit and separate
48 accounting of money received from the issuance of such special permits in the Division of
49 Forestry Account. Section 4 also provides that any money which is received by the Division
50 from the issuance of such special permits or related to the provisions governing the control of
51 forest insects and diseases and is remaining in the Division of Forestry Account at the end of a
52 fiscal year does not revert to the State General Fund and requires that the remaining balance of
53 such money in the Account be carried forward to the next fiscal year.

(BDR 26-1237)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Contains Appropriation not included in
Executive Budget.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to state financial administration; revising provisions relating to
the lease of residential property owned by this State to state officers
and employees; authorizing a temporary advance from the State
General Fund for expenses relating to fire suppression and emergency
response in certain circumstances; creating the Out-of-State Fire
Suppression Account; revising provisions relating to the Division of
Forestry Account; making an appropriation; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the Administrator of the Division of State Lands of the State
2 Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, as ex officio State Land Registrar, to
3 lease residential property owned by this State for less than the fair market value of the
4 property to a state officer or employee who is required as a condition of his or her
5 employment to reside in state-owned residential property. (NRS 322.063) Section 1 of this
6 bill expands this authority to allow the lease of state-owned residential property at less than
7 fair market value to a state officer or employee if a state agency that manages state-owned
8 residential property determines that it is beneficial to the State of Nevada for the state officer
9 or employee to reside in the property. Section 1 also requires a state agency that manages
10 state-owned residential property to account separately for the rent collected from such leases
11 and use the money only for the operation and maintenance of state-owned residential property
12 that is managed by the state agency. Section 1 provides that the remaining balance of money
13 collected from such rent does not revert to the State General Fund at the end of a fiscal year
14 and is required to be carried forward to the next fiscal year.
15 Existing law authorizes temporary advances from the State General Fund to specified
16 state agencies for certain delays in the receipt of revenue or for certain emergencies. (NRS
17 353.3463-353.361) During the 2023-2025 biennium, the Director of the State Department of
18 Conservation and Natural Resources was authorized to request a temporary advance from the
19 State General Fund to pay authorized expenses incurred by the Department in the suppression
20 of fires or in response to emergencies for which there was a delay in the receipt of revenue for
21 services billed to the Federal Government, local governments and other state governments.
22 (Section 71 of chapter 209, Statutes of Nevada 2023, at page 1253) Section 2 of this bill
23 codifies in the Nevada Revised Statutes the authority for the Department to request such a
24 temporary advance.

Assembly Amendment No. 900 to Senate Bill No. 499 Page 4
25 Under existing law, the executive head of the Division of Forestry of the State
26 Department of Conservation and Natural Resources is the State Forester Firewarden. (NRS
27 232.120) Existing law charges the State Forester Firewarden with overseeing various fire
28 protection activities for the State. (Chapter 472 of NRS) Section 3 of this bill creates the Out-
29 of-State Fire Suppression Account in the State General Fund for the payment of the costs
30 incurred by the State of Nevada for response to out-of-state fires and emergencies and for the
31 receipt of reimbursement for those costs. Section 3: (1) requires that the State Forester
32 Firewarden administer the Out-of-State Fire Suppression Account; and (2) provides that
33 money remaining in that Account at the end of a fiscal year does not revert to the State
34 General Fund and is carried forward to the next fiscal year. Section 5 of this bill appropriates
35 [$10,000,000] $27,359,038 from the State General Fund to the Out-of-State Fire Suppression
36 Account created by section 3.
37 Existing law creates the Division of Forestry Account in the State General Fund for the
38 receipt of: (1) certain money received from the operation of a conservation camp or from the
39 assignment of any crew of a conservation camp; (2) any federal money allotted to the State of
40 Nevada under the terms of certain federal agreements and such other money as may be
41 received by the State for the management and protection of forests, rangelands and watershed
42 areas; and (3) money received by the Division related to the provisions governing the control
43 of forest insects and diseases. (NRS 209.231, 472.050, 527.230) Existing law also: (1)
44 requires the placement on a list of fully protected species any species or subspecies of native
45 flora that is declared to be threatened by extinction; and (2) prohibits the removal or
46 destruction of any such species or subspecies except under a special permit issued by the State
47 Forester Firewarden. (NRS 527.270) Section 4 of this bill requires the deposit and separate
48 accounting of money received from the issuance of such special permits in the Division of
49 Forestry Account. Section 4 also provides that any money which is received by the Division
50 from the issuance of such special permits or related to the provisions governing the control of
51 forest insects and diseases and is remaining in the Division of Forestry Account at the end of a
52 fiscal year does not revert to the State General Fund and requires that the remaining balance of
53 such money in the Account be carried forward to the next fiscal year.
