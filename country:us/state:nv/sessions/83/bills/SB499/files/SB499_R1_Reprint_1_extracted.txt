SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to state financial

FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Contains Appropriation not included

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to state financial administration; revising
provisions relating to the lease of residential property
owned by this State to state officers and employees;
authorizing a temporary advance from the State General
Fund for expenses relating to fire suppression and
emergency response in certain circumstances; creating the
Out-of-State Fire Suppression Account; revising
provisions relating to the Division of Forestry Account;
making an appropriation; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the Administrator of the Division of State Lands of the
2 State Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, as ex officio State Land
3 Registrar, to lease residential property owned by this State for less than the fair
4 market value of the property to a state officer or employee who is required as a
5 condition of his or her employment to reside in state-owned residential property.
6 (NRS 322.063) Section 1 of this bill expands this authority to allow the lease of
7 state-owned residential property at less than fair market value to a state officer or
8 employee if a state agency that manages state-owned residential property
9 determines that it is beneficial to the State of Nevada for the state officer or
10 employee to reside in the property. Section 1 also requires a state agency that
11 manages state-owned residential property to account separately for the rent
12 collected from such leases and use the money only for the operation and
13 maintenance of state-owned residential property that is managed by the state
14 agency. Section 1 provides that the remaining balance of money collected from
15 such rent does not revert to the State General Fund at the end of a fiscal year and is
16 required to be carried forward to the next fiscal year.

17 Existing law authorizes temporary advances from the State General Fund to
18 specified state agencies for certain delays in the receipt of revenue or for certain
19 emergencies. (NRS 353.3463-353.361) During the 2023-2025 biennium, the
20 Director of the State Department of Conservation and Natural Resources was
21 authorized to request a temporary advance from the State General Fund to pay
22 authorized expenses incurred by the Department in the suppression of fires or in
23 response to emergencies for which there was a delay in the receipt of revenue for
24 services billed to the Federal Government, local governments and other state
25 governments. (Section 71 of chapter 209, Statutes of Nevada 2023, at page 1253)
26 Section 2 of this bill codifies in the Nevada Revised Statutes the authority for the
27 Department to request such a temporary advance.
28 Under existing law, the executive head of the Division of Forestry of the State
29 Department of Conservation and Natural Resources is the State Forester
30 Firewarden. (NRS 232.120) Existing law charges the State Forester Firewarden
31 with overseeing various fire protection activities for the State. (Chapter 472 of
32 NRS) Section 3 of this bill creates the Out-of-State Fire Suppression Account in the
33 State General Fund for the payment of the costs incurred by the State of Nevada for
34 response to out-of-state fires and emergencies and for the receipt of reimbursement
35 for those costs. Section 3: (1) requires that the State Forester Firewarden administer
36 the Out-of-State Fire Suppression Account; and (2) provides that money remaining
37 in that Account at the end of a fiscal year does not revert to the State General Fund
38 and is carried forward to the next fiscal year. Section 5 of this bill appropriates
39 $27,359,038 from the State General Fund to the Out-of-State Fire Suppression
40 Account created by section 3.
41 Existing law creates the Division of Forestry Account in the State General Fund
42 for the receipt of: (1) certain money received from the operation of a conservation
43 camp or from the assignment of any crew of a conservation camp; (2) any federal
44 money allotted to the State of Nevada under the terms of certain federal agreements
45 and such other money as may be received by the State for the management and
46 protection of forests, rangelands and watershed areas; and (3) money received by
47 the Division related to the provisions governing the control of forest insects and
48 diseases. (NRS 209.231, 472.050, 527.230) Existing law also: (1) requires the
49 placement on a list of fully protected species any species or subspecies of native
50 flora that is declared to be threatened by extinction; and (2) prohibits the removal or
51 destruction of any such species or subspecies except under a special permit issued
52 by the State Forester Firewarden. (NRS 527.270) Section 4 of this bill requires the
53 deposit and separate accounting of money received from the issuance of such
54 special permits in the Division of Forestry Account. Section 4 also provides that
55 any money which is received by the Division from the issuance of such special
56 permits or related to the provisions governing the control of forest insects and
57 diseases and is remaining in the Division of Forestry Account at the end of a fiscal
58 year does not revert to the State General Fund and requires that the remaining
59 balance of such money in the Account be carried forward to the next fiscal year.
