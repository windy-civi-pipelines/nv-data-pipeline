AN ACT relating to business; revising provisions relating to
contributions into the Unemployment Compensation
Fund; providing an exemption for certain persons from
paying certain fees for an application and first renewal of
a state business license; establishing requirements relating
to the review and approval of an application to modify a

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under the Unemployment Compensation Law: (1) with certain exceptions,
2 employers and employing units that employ one or more persons are required to
3 pay contributions into the Unemployment Compensation Fund at a certain rate of
4 the wages paid by the employer for employment; and (2) persons who have become
5 unemployed and comply with certain requirements are eligible for benefits from the
6 Unemployment Compensation Fund in an amount based on the person’s previous
7 wages for employment. (Chapter 612 of NRS) Existing law authorizes certain
8 employers to elect to reimburse the Unemployment Compensation Fund for
9 benefits paid to their former employees rather than making quarterly contributions
10 to the Unemployment Compensation Fund. (NRS 612.553) Sections 3.3-3.7 of this
11 bill authorize an employer or employing unit that employs only one person who
12 owns the organization, trade or business of the employer or employing unit or
13 employer or employing unit that employs not more than two persons who share a
14 familial relationship within the first degree of consanguinity who own the
15 organization, trade or business of the employer or employing unit to make such an
16 election.
17 Existing law requires a person who applies for a state business license or the
18 renewal of a state business license to pay a fee of $200 or, for certain corporations,
-
*AB423_R1*

– 2 –
19 $500. (NRS 76.100, 76.130) Section 6 of this bill exempts certain persons from
20 paying a fee for an initial application for a state business license and the first
21 renewal of the state business license if the person: (1) does not qualify for certain
22 existing tax abatements and partial tax abatements; or (2) attests that the business
23 will employ a certain number of full-time employees in the county or city of the
24 place of business by the eighth calendar quarter after the initial application fee is
25 waived or will make a certain amount of capital investment in the State not later
26 than 2 years after the initial application fee is waived. Upon the second renewal of a
27 state business license, section 6 requires the Secretary of State to review the
28 records of the business to verify that the business met such criteria and if the
29 business did not, require the person to pay the fees that were waived.
30 Sections 7 and 8 of this bill provide that the exemption provided in section 6 is
31 an exception to the requirement to pay a fee for an application and renewal of a
32 state business license.
33 Existing law requires a land use authority with jurisdiction over an application
34 to construct a facility for personal wireless service to establish procedures and
35 standards for the review and approval of such an application. (NRS 707.575)
36 Section 10 of this bill establishes requirements relating to the review of an
37 application to modify a facility for personal wireless service by a land use authority
38 with jurisdiction over the application.
39 Section 11 of this bill applies certain existing definitions relating to facilities
40 for personal wireless service to section 10. Section 12 of this bill requires that a
41 denial of an application to modify a facility for personal wireless service be in
42 writing.

12 payable by each employer who elects to make payments by way of
13 reimbursement in lieu of contributions must be an amount which
14 bears the same ratio to the total benefits paid to a person as the total
15 base-period wages paid to that person by the employer bear to the
16 total base-period wages paid to that person by all of the person’s
17 base-period employers. Two or more employers who have become
18 liable for payments by way of reimbursement in lieu of
19 contributions may file a joint application, in accordance with

31 Administrator a written notice terminating its election not later than
32 30 days before the beginning of the taxable year for which the

– 4 –
1 election is not terminable by the organization for that and the next
2 taxable year.
3 4. The Administrator may for a good cause extend the period in
4 which a notice of election or a notice of termination must be filed
5 and may permit an election to be retroactive, but not any earlier than
6 with respect to benefits paid after December 31, 1970, for a
7 nonprofit organization, December 31, 1976, for a political entity, or

17 status as an employer and of the effective date of any election which
18 it makes and of any termination of such election. The
19 Administrator’s determination is subject to reconsideration, petitions
20 for hearing and judicial review in accordance with the provisions of
21 this chapter.
22 6. The amount of reimbursement in lieu of contributions due
23 from each employing unit which elects to make reimbursement in
24 lieu of contributions must be determined by the Administrator as
25 soon as practicable after the end of each calendar quarter or at the
26 end of any other period as determined by the Administrator. The
27 Administrator shall bill each employing unit which makes
28 reimbursement in lieu of contributions for an amount determined
29 pursuant to paragraph (a) of subsection 2. Amounts due under this
30 subsection must be paid not later than 30 days after a bill is mailed
31 to the last known address of the employing unit or electronically
32 transmitted to the employing unit. If payment is not made on or
33 before the date due and payable, the whole or any part thereafter
34 remaining unpaid bears interest at the rate of one-half percent per
35 month or fraction thereof, from and after the due date until payment
36 is received by the Administrator. The amount of payments due, but
37 not paid, may be collected by the Administrator, together with
38 interest and penalties, if any, in the same manner and subject to the

6 chapter, all employers required to pay contributions under NRS

22 this chapter.
23 3. The amount of the special bond contributions must be
24 calculated and assessed annually, or more frequently as provided in
25 subsection 4, by the Administrator as the amount necessary for the
26 following purposes:
27 (a) To pay the bond obligations and bond administrative
28 expenses that are due in that year or any other year;

37 discretion; and
38 (d) To fund optional redemption, mandatory redemption,
39 purchase, refunding or defeasance of outstanding bonds that will

45 instruments in connection with the bonds, the Administrator shall
-

38 accordance with the conditions specified in Title XII of the Social
39 Security Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1321 et seq., as amended.

2 subject to the provisions of this chapter shall pay a proportionate
3 share of the assessment established by the Administrator pursuant to

5 will be calculated by multiplying the employer’s total taxable wages
6 paid during the immediately preceding calendar year by the amount
7 of the assessment. The Administrator shall notify each employer of
8 his or her proportionate share of the assessment on or before June 30
9 of each year, and may collect interest on any such amount that
10 remains unpaid on July 31 of each year in accordance with the
11 provisions of NRS 612.620. Any money collected from an employer

13 Repayment Fund. The Administrator shall establish procedures
14 necessary to collect payments pursuant to this subsection.
15 5. An employer’s proportionate share of the assessment must
16 not be charged against the experience rating record of the employer.

21 organization, political subdivision , employer who has in its employ
22 only one person who is the owner or sole shareholder of the

26 owners or sole shareholders of the organization, trade or business
27 or Indian tribe which makes reimbursements in lieu of contributions
28 pursuant to NRS 612.553.
29 8. The provisions of this section are operative only so long as
30 the Interest Repayment Fund continues to exist and the
31 Administrator continues to accept and deposit payments received
32 from employers pursuant to this section into the Interest Repayment
33 Fund. If the Administrator determines that the assessment is no
34 longer necessary, the Administrator shall notify all employers
35 paying a proportionate share of the assessment and shall not accept
36 any further payments. If and when the Interest Repayment Fund
37 ceases to exist, any money remaining in the Interest Repayment
38 Fund, after the payment of all interest accruing and payable on
39 advances received pursuant to NRS 612.290 and a determination by
40 the Administrator that no further payments are anticipated, must be
41 deposited into the Unemployment Compensation Fund.

41 requested to receive communications by electronic transmission, by
42 electronic mail or other electronic communication.
43 5. A person who continues to do business in this State without

2 business license with the Secretary of State.
3 6. The Secretary of State shall waive the annual state business
4 license fee and any related penalty imposed on a natural person or
