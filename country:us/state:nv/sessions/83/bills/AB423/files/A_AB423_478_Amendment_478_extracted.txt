AN ACT relating to business; [requiring the Administrator of the Employment
Security Division of the Department of Employment, Training and
Rehabilitation to adopt regulations establishing a process for certain
employers and employing units to elect not to make] revising
provisions relating to contributions into the Unemployment
Compensation Fund; providing an exemption for certain persons from
paying certain fees for an application and first renewal of a state
business license; establishing requirements relating to the review and
approval of an application to modify a facility for personal wireless
service by certain land use authorities; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under the Unemployment Compensation Law: (1) with certain exceptions, employers and
2 employing units that employ one or more persons are required to pay contributions into the
3 Unemployment Compensation Fund at a certain rate of the wages paid by the employer for
4 employment; and (2) persons who have become unemployed and comply with certain
5 requirements are eligible for benefits from the Unemployment Compensation Fund in an
6 amount based on the person’s previous wages for employment. (Chapter 612 of NRS)
7 Existing law authorizes certain employers to elect to reimburse the Unemployment
8 Compensation Fund for benefits paid to their former employees rather than making
9 quarterly contributions to the Unemployment Compensation Fund. (NRS 612.553)
10 [Section 3] Sections 3.3-3.7 of this bill [: (1) requires the Administrator of the Employment
11 Security Division of the Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation to establish
12 by regulation a process for] authorize an employer or employing unit that employs only one
13 person who owns the organization, trade or business of the employer or employing unit or
14 employer or employing unit that employs not more than two persons who share a
15 familial relationship within the first degree of consanguinity who own the organization,
16 trade or business of the employer or employing unit to [elect not to] make [contributions
17 into the Unemployment Compensation Fund; and (2) provides that if a person makes] such an
18 election . [, he or she is not eligible to receive benefits from the Fund.
19 Section 2 of this bill exempts from the services included in the term “employment” any
20 services performed by a person who has elected not to make contributions on behalf of
21 himself or herself under the regulations adopted pursuant to section 3. Sections 4 and 5 of this
Assembly Amendment No. 478 to Assembly Bill No. 423 Page 4
22 bill apply the exemption from the definition of “employment” in section 2 to the provisions of
23 existing law relating to unemployment compensation.
24 Existing law defines “employer” for purposes of an excise tax imposed on employers to
25 mean any employer who is required to pay contributions into the Unemployment
26 Compensation Fund. (NRS 363B.030) Section 9 of this bill includes in this definition any
27 employer who elects not to make contributions pursuant to section 2.]
28 Existing law requires a person who applies for a state business license or the renewal of a
29 state business license to pay a fee of $200 or, for certain corporations, $500. (NRS 76.100,
30 76.130) Section 6 of this bill exempts certain persons from paying a fee for an initial
31 application for a state business license and the first renewal of the state business license if the
32 person: (1) does not qualify for certain existing tax abatements and partial tax abatements; or
33 (2) attests that the business will employ a certain number of full-time employees in the county
34 or city of the place of business by the eighth calendar quarter after the initial application fee is
35 waived or will make a certain amount of capital investment in the State not later than 2 years
36 after the initial application fee is waived. Upon the second renewal of a state business license,
37 section 6 requires the Secretary of State to review the records of the business to verify that the
38 business met such criteria and if the business did not, require the person to pay the fees that
39 were waived.
40 Sections 7 and 8 of this bill provide that the exemption provided in section 6 is an
41 exception to the requirement to pay a fee for an application and renewal of a state business
42 license.
43 Existing law requires a land use authority with jurisdiction over an application to
44 construct a facility for personal wireless service to establish procedures and standards for the
45 review and approval of such an application. (NRS 707.575) Section 10 of this bill establishes
46 requirements relating to the review [and approval] of an application to modify a facility for
47 personal wireless service by a land use authority with jurisdiction over the application.
48 Section 11 of this bill applies certain existing definitions relating to facilities for personal
49 wireless service to section 10. Section 12 of this bill requires that a denial of an application to
50 modify a facility for personal wireless service be in writing.

19 to make payments by way of reimbursement in lieu of contributions must be an
20 amount which bears the same ratio to the total benefits paid to a person as the total
21 base-period wages paid to that person by the employer bear to the total base-period
22 wages paid to that person by all of the person’s base-period employers. Two or
23 more employers who have become liable for payments by way of reimbursement in
24 lieu of contributions may file a joint application, in accordance with regulations of

17 paragraph (a) of subsection 2. Amounts due under this subsection must be paid not
18 later than 30 days after a bill is mailed to the last known address of the employing
19 unit or electronically transmitted to the employing unit. If payment is not made on

6 deposit payments received from employers pursuant to this section into the Interest
7 Repayment Fund. If the Administrator determines that the assessment is no longer
8 necessary, the Administrator shall notify all employers paying a proportionate share
9 of the assessment and shall not accept any further payments. If and when the
10 Interest Repayment Fund ceases to exist, any money remaining in the Interest
11 Repayment Fund, after the payment of all interest accruing and payable on
12 advances received pursuant to NRS 612.290 and a determination by the

25 Sec. 8. NRS 76.130 is hereby amended to read as follows:
26 76.130 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2 [,] and section 6 of
27 this act, a person who applies for renewal of a state business license shall submit a
28 fee in the amount of $200 to the Secretary of State:
29 (a) If the person is an entity required to file an annual list with the Secretary of
30 State pursuant to this title, at the time the person submits the annual list to the
31 Secretary of State, unless the person submits a certificate or other form evidencing
32 the dissolution of the entity; or
33 (b) If the person is not an entity required to file an annual list with the
34 Secretary of State pursuant to this title, on the last day of the month in which the

37 before that date, indicating that the person will not be conducting a business in this
38 State after that date.
39 2. [If] Except as otherwise provided in section 6 of this act, if the person

51 4. If a person fails to submit the annual state business license fee required
52 pursuant to this section in a timely manner and the person is:
Assembly Amendment No. 478 to Assembly Bill No. 423 Page 12

13 business license fee. The Secretary of State shall provide to the person a written
14 notice that:
15 (1) Must include a statement indicating the amount of the fees and
16 penalties required pursuant to this section and the costs remaining unpaid.
17 (2) May be provided electronically, if the person has requested to receive
18 communications by electronic transmission, by electronic mail or other electronic
19 communication.
20 5. A person who continues to do business in this State without renewing the
21 person’s state business license before its renewal date is subject to the fees and
22 penalties provided for in this section unless the person files a certificate of
23 cancellation of the person’s state business license with the Secretary of State.
24 6. The Secretary of State shall waive the annual state business license fee and
25 any related penalty imposed on a natural person or partnership if the natural person
26 or partnership provides evidence satisfactory to the Secretary of State that the
27 natural person or partnership conducted no business in this State during the period
28 for which the fees and penalties would be waived.

6 Sec. 10. Chapter 707 of NRS is hereby amended by adding thereto a new
7 section to read as follows:
8 Except as otherwise provided in federal law [:
9 1. Notwithstanding] , notwithstanding any specific statute or ordinance to
10 the contrary, a land use authority with jurisdiction over an application to modify
11 a facility for personal wireless service shall review an application to modify the
12 facility in accordance with the requirements of [this section.
13 2. Except as otherwise provided in subsections 5 and 6, a land use authority
14 may not deny and shall approve an application to modify a facility for personal
15 wireless service in not more than 60 days if the modification:
16 (a) Would not substantially change the physical dimensions of the facility for
17 personal wireless service; or
18 (b) Involves:
19 (1) The collocation of new transmission equipment;
20 (2) The removal of transmission equipment; or
21 (3) The replacement of transmission equipment.
22 3. For the purposes of paragraph (a) of subsection 2, a modification
23 substantially changes the physical dimensions of a facility for personal wireless
24 service if:
25 (a) For a tower that is not in a right-of-way, the modification increases the
26 height of the tower by more than 10 percent or by the height of one additional
27 antenna array with separation from the nearest existing antenna not to exceed 20
28 feet, whichever is greater, and for other facilities for personal wireless service,
29 the modification increases the height of the structure by not more than 10 percent
30 or more than 10 feet, whichever is greater. For the purposes of this paragraph:
31 (1) Changes in height must be measured from:
32 (I) The original support structure in cases where deployments are or
33 will be separated horizontally, such as on the rooftop of a building; and
34 (II) The dimensions of the facility for personal wireless service,
35 inclusive of originally approved appurtenances and any modifications approved
36 before October 1, 2025; and
37 (2) The separation from the nearest existing antenna means the distance
38 from the top of the highest existing antenna on the facility for personal wireless
39 service to the bottom of the proposed new antenna to be deployed above the
40 highest existing antenna.
41 (b) For a tower that is not in a right-of-way, the modification involves adding
42 the appurtenance to the body of the tower that would protrude more than 20 feet
43 from the edge of the tower or more than the width of the tower structure at the
44 level of the appurtenance, whichever is greater.
45 (c) For a tower that is in a right-of-way, the modification involves the
46 installation of:
47 (1) New equipment cabinets on the ground if there are no existing
48 cabinets on the ground associated with the tower; or
49 (2) Cabinets on the ground that are more than 10 percent larger in
50 height or overall volume than any other cabinet on the ground associated with
51 the structure.
52 (d) For any facility for personal wireless service, the modification:
Assembly Amendment No. 478 to Assembly Bill No. 423 Page 14
1 (1) Involves the installation of more than the standard number of new
2 equipment cabinets, but not to exceed four cabinets;
3 (2) Would defeat the concealment element of the facility for personal
4 wireless service;
5 (3) Does not comply with the siting approval conditions; or
6 (4) Does not comply with the conditions associated with the siting
7 approval of the construction or modification of the facility for personal wireless
8 service, provided that this limitation does not apply to any modification that is
9 noncompliant only in a manner that would not exceed the thresholds identified in
10 this paragraph and paragraphs (a), (b) and (c).
11 (e) The modification involves:
12 (1) For towers not in a public right-of-way, the excavation or deployment
13 of transmission equipment outside of the current site of the facility for personal
14 wireless service by more than 30 feet in any direction, which 30-foot site
15 boundary excludes any access or utility easements related to the site; and
16 (2) For all other excavations or deployments, the excavation or
17 deployment outside of the current site of the facility for personal wireless service.
18 4. If an applicant to modify a facility for personal wireless service asserts in
19 writing that the application meets the requirements of subsection 2, the land use
20 authority:
21 (a) May require the applicant to provide documentation or information
22 regarding the application only to the extent such documentation is reasonably
23 related to the need for the land use authority to determine whether the
24 application meets the requirements of this section; and
25 (b) May not require the applicant to submit any documentation other than as
26 described in paragraph (a), including, without limitation, any documentation
27 supporting the need for the facility for personal wireless service or the decision to
28 modify the facility for personal wireless service.
29 5. For the purposes of subsection 2, the time period within which approval
30 must be granted by a land use authority:
31 (a) Begins to run on the date that the applicant:
32 (1) Takes the first procedural action that the land use authority requires
33 as part of the process for an application to modify a facility for personal wireless
34 service, which must be a single action and may not be a combination or sequence
35 of actions; and
36 (2) If not part of the first procedural action, asserts in writing that the
37 application meets the requirements of subsection 2.
38 (b) May be tolled only by mutual agreement or in accordance with subsection
39 6 if the land use authority determines that the application is incomplete and may
40 not be tolled by a moratorium on the review of applications.
41 6. If a land use authority determines that an application is incomplete:
42 (a) The land use authority shall, not more than 30 days after the date the
43 application is submitted, provide written notice to the applicant that the
44 application is incomplete. The notice must, without limitation, clearly and
45 specifically delineate all missing documents or information in accordance with
46 the documentation and information that may be required pursuant to paragraph
47 (a) of subsection 4.
48 (b) If the land use authority determines that the supplemental documents or
49 information submitted pursuant to paragraph (a) do not satisfy the missing
50 documents or information originally identified pursuant to paragraph (a), the
51 land use authority shall, not more than 10 days after receiving the supplemental
52 documents or information, provide written notice to the applicant that the
53 supplemental documents or information are insufficient. The land use authority
Assembly Amendment No. 478 to Assembly Bill No. 423 Page 15
1 may not request supplemental documents or information that was not originally
2 identified in the notice provided pursuant to paragraph (a).
3 (c) The time period to grant approval is tolled beginning on the date the land
4 use authority sends a written notice to the applicant pursuant to paragraph (a) or
5 (b) and begins running again on the date on which the applicant submits the
6 supplemental documents or information in response to the notice provided
7 pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b).
8 7. If a land use authority fails to approve or deny an application to modify a
9 facility for personal wireless service in not more than 60 days or, if the
10 application is tolled pursuant to subsection 5 or 6, if the land use authority fails
11 to approve or deny such an application in 60 days plus any days in which the
12 application was tolled, the application shall be deemed granted. The approval of
13 an application pursuant to this subsection does not take effect until the date on
14 which the applicant notifies the land use authority in writing that the time period
15 has expired and the application has been deemed granted.] 47 U.S.C. § 332, as
16 amended, 47 U.S.C. § 1455(a) and any applicable rules, interpretations and
17 requirements imposed by the Federal Communications Commission and the
18 Federal Aviation Administration.
19 Sec. 11. NRS 707.550 is hereby amended to read as follows:
20 707.550 As used in NRS 707.550 to 707.585, inclusive, and section 10 of
21 this act, unless the context otherwise requires, the words and terms defined in NRS
22 707.555 to 707.570, inclusive, have the meanings ascribed to them in those
23 sections.
24 Sec. 12. NRS 707.585 is hereby amended to read as follows:
25 707.585 1. A land use authority that denies the approval of an application to
26 construct or modify a facility for personal wireless service shall issue a written
27 decision. The decision must:
28 (a) Set forth with specificity each ground on which the authority denied the
29 approval of the application; and
30 (b) Describe the documents relied upon by the land use authority in making its
31 decision.
32 2. A person who brings an action against a land use authority pursuant to
33 NRS 278.0233 shall file a copy of the decision and record with the court.

AN ACT relating to business; [requiring the Administrator of the Employment
Security Division of the Department of Employment, Training and
Rehabilitation to adopt regulations establishing a process for certain
employers and employing units to elect not to make] revising
provisions relating to contributions into the Unemployment
Compensation Fund; providing an exemption for certain persons from
paying certain fees for an application and first renewal of a state
business license; establishing requirements relating to the review and
approval of an application to modify a facility for personal wireless
service by certain land use authorities; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under the Unemployment Compensation Law: (1) with certain exceptions, employers and
2 employing units that employ one or more persons are required to pay contributions into the
3 Unemployment Compensation Fund at a certain rate of the wages paid by the employer for
4 employment; and (2) persons who have become unemployed and comply with certain
5 requirements are eligible for benefits from the Unemployment Compensation Fund in an
6 amount based on the person’s previous wages for employment. (Chapter 612 of NRS)
7 Existing law authorizes certain employers to elect to reimburse the Unemployment
8 Compensation Fund for benefits paid to their former employees rather than making
9 quarterly contributions to the Unemployment Compensation Fund. (NRS 612.553)
10 [Section 3] Sections 3.3-3.7 of this bill [: (1) requires the Administrator of the Employment
11 Security Division of the Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation to establish
12 by regulation a process for] authorize an employer or employing unit that employs only one
13 person who owns the organization, trade or business of the employer or employing unit or
14 employer or employing unit that employs not more than two persons who share a
15 familial relationship within the first degree of consanguinity who own the organization,
16 trade or business of the employer or employing unit to [elect not to] make [contributions
17 into the Unemployment Compensation Fund; and (2) provides that if a person makes] such an
18 election . [, he or she is not eligible to receive benefits from the Fund.
19 Section 2 of this bill exempts from the services included in the term “employment” any
20 services performed by a person who has elected not to make contributions on behalf of
21 himself or herself under the regulations adopted pursuant to section 3. Sections 4 and 5 of this

Assembly Amendment No. 478 to Assembly Bill No. 423 Page 4
22 bill apply the exemption from the definition of “employment” in section 2 to the provisions of
23 existing law relating to unemployment compensation.
24 Existing law defines “employer” for purposes of an excise tax imposed on employers to
25 mean any employer who is required to pay contributions into the Unemployment
26 Compensation Fund. (NRS 363B.030) Section 9 of this bill includes in this definition any
27 employer who elects not to make contributions pursuant to section 2.]
28 Existing law requires a person who applies for a state business license or the renewal of a
29 state business license to pay a fee of $200 or, for certain corporations, $500. (NRS 76.100,
30 76.130) Section 6 of this bill exempts certain persons from paying a fee for an initial
31 application for a state business license and the first renewal of the state business license if the
32 person: (1) does not qualify for certain existing tax abatements and partial tax abatements; or
33 (2) attests that the business will employ a certain number of full-time employees in the county
34 or city of the place of business by the eighth calendar quarter after the initial application fee is
35 waived or will make a certain amount of capital investment in the State not later than 2 years
36 after the initial application fee is waived. Upon the second renewal of a state business license,
37 section 6 requires the Secretary of State to review the records of the business to verify that the
38 business met such criteria and if the business did not, require the person to pay the fees that
39 were waived.
40 Sections 7 and 8 of this bill provide that the exemption provided in section 6 is an
41 exception to the requirement to pay a fee for an application and renewal of a state business
42 license.
43 Existing law requires a land use authority with jurisdiction over an application to
44 construct a facility for personal wireless service to establish procedures and standards for the
45 review and approval of such an application. (NRS 707.575) Section 10 of this bill establishes
46 requirements relating to the review [and approval] of an application to modify a facility for
47 personal wireless service by a land use authority with jurisdiction over the application.
48 Section 11 of this bill applies certain existing definitions relating to facilities for personal
49 wireless service to section 10. Section 12 of this bill requires that a denial of an application to
50 modify a facility for personal wireless service be in writing.

17 paragraph (a) of subsection 2. Amounts due under this subsection must be paid not
18 later than 30 days after a bill is mailed to the last known address of the employing
19 unit or electronically transmitted to the employing unit. If payment is not made on

25 Sec. 8. NRS 76.130 is hereby amended to read as follows:
26 76.130 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2 [,] and section 6 of
27 this act, a person who applies for renewal of a state business license shall submit a
28 fee in the amount of $200 to the Secretary of State:
29 (a) If the person is an entity required to file an annual list with the Secretary of
30 State pursuant to this title, at the time the person submits the annual list to the
31 Secretary of State, unless the person submits a certificate or other form evidencing
32 the dissolution of the entity; or
33 (b) If the person is not an entity required to file an annual list with the
34 Secretary of State pursuant to this title, on the last day of the month in which the
35 anniversary date of issuance of the state business license occurs in each year, unless
36 the person submits a written statement to the Secretary of State, at least 10 days
37 before that date, indicating that the person will not be conducting a business in this
38 State after that date.
39 2. [If] Except as otherwise provided in section 6 of this act, if the person
40 applying for the renewal of a state business license pursuant to subsection 1 is a
41 corporation organized pursuant to chapter 78, 78A or 78B of NRS, or a foreign
42 corporation required to file an initial or annual list with the Secretary of State
43 pursuant to chapter 80 of NRS, the fee for the renewal of a state business license is
44 $500.
45 3. The Secretary of State shall, 90 days before the last day for filing an

47 business license, provide to the person a notice of the state business license fee due
48 pursuant to this section and a reminder to file the application for renewal required
49 pursuant to this section. Failure of any person to receive a notice does not excuse
50 the person from the penalty imposed by law.
51 4. If a person fails to submit the annual state business license fee required
52 pursuant to this section in a timely manner and the person is:

Assembly Amendment No. 478 to Assembly Bill No. 423 Page 12
1 (a) An entity required to file an annual list with the Secretary of State pursuant
2 to this title, the person:

11 (b) Not an entity required to file an annual list with the Secretary of State, the
12 person shall pay a penalty in the amount of $100 in addition to the annual state
13 business license fee. The Secretary of State shall provide to the person a written
14 notice that:
15 (1) Must include a statement indicating the amount of the fees and
16 penalties required pursuant to this section and the costs remaining unpaid.
17 (2) May be provided electronically, if the person has requested to receive
18 communications by electronic transmission, by electronic mail or other electronic
19 communication.
20 5. A person who continues to do business in this State without renewing the
21 person’s state business license before its renewal date is subject to the fees and
22 penalties provided for in this section unless the person files a certificate of
23 cancellation of the person’s state business license with the Secretary of State.
24 6. The Secretary of State shall waive the annual state business license fee and
25 any related penalty imposed on a natural person or partnership if the natural person
26 or partnership provides evidence satisfactory to the Secretary of State that the
27 natural person or partnership conducted no business in this State during the period
28 for which the fees and penalties would be waived.

5 612.055.] (Deleted by amendment.)
6 Sec. 10. Chapter 707 of NRS is hereby amended by adding thereto a new
7 section to read as follows:
8 Except as otherwise provided in federal law [:
9 1. Notwithstanding] , notwithstanding any specific statute or ordinance to
10 the contrary, a land use authority with jurisdiction over an application to modify
11 a facility for personal wireless service shall review an application to modify the
12 facility in accordance with the requirements of [this section.
13 2. Except as otherwise provided in subsections 5 and 6, a land use authority
14 may not deny and shall approve an application to modify a facility for personal
15 wireless service in not more than 60 days if the modification:
16 (a) Would not substantially change the physical dimensions of the facility for
17 personal wireless service; or
18 (b) Involves:
19 (1) The collocation of new transmission equipment;
20 (2) The removal of transmission equipment; or
21 (3) The replacement of transmission equipment.
22 3. For the purposes of paragraph (a) of subsection 2, a modification
23 substantially changes the physical dimensions of a facility for personal wireless
24 service if:
25 (a) For a tower that is not in a right-of-way, the modification increases the
26 height of the tower by more than 10 percent or by the height of one additional
27 antenna array with separation from the nearest existing antenna not to exceed 20
28 feet, whichever is greater, and for other facilities for personal wireless service,
29 the modification increases the height of the structure by not more than 10 percent
30 or more than 10 feet, whichever is greater. For the purposes of this paragraph:
31 (1) Changes in height must be measured from:
32 (I) The original support structure in cases where deployments are or
33 will be separated horizontally, such as on the rooftop of a building; and
34 (II) The dimensions of the facility for personal wireless service,
35 inclusive of originally approved appurtenances and any modifications approved
36 before October 1, 2025; and
37 (2) The separation from the nearest existing antenna means the distance
38 from the top of the highest existing antenna on the facility for personal wireless
39 service to the bottom of the proposed new antenna to be deployed above the
40 highest existing antenna.
41 (b) For a tower that is not in a right-of-way, the modification involves adding
42 the appurtenance to the body of the tower that would protrude more than 20 feet
43 from the edge of the tower or more than the width of the tower structure at the
44 level of the appurtenance, whichever is greater.
45 (c) For a tower that is in a right-of-way, the modification involves the
46 installation of:
47 (1) New equipment cabinets on the ground if there are no existing
48 cabinets on the ground associated with the tower; or
49 (2) Cabinets on the ground that are more than 10 percent larger in
50 height or overall volume than any other cabinet on the ground associated with
51 the structure.
52 (d) For any facility for personal wireless service, the modification:

Assembly Amendment No. 478 to Assembly Bill No. 423 Page 14
1 (1) Involves the installation of more than the standard number of new
2 equipment cabinets, but not to exceed four cabinets;
3 (2) Would defeat the concealment element of the facility for personal
4 wireless service;
5 (3) Does not comply with the siting approval conditions; or
6 (4) Does not comply with the conditions associated with the siting
7 approval of the construction or modification of the facility for personal wireless
8 service, provided that this limitation does not apply to any modification that is
9 noncompliant only in a manner that would not exceed the thresholds identified in
10 this paragraph and paragraphs (a), (b) and (c).
11 (e) The modification involves:
12 (1) For towers not in a public right-of-way, the excavation or deployment
13 of transmission equipment outside of the current site of the facility for personal
14 wireless service by more than 30 feet in any direction, which 30-foot site
15 boundary excludes any access or utility easements related to the site; and
16 (2) For all other excavations or deployments, the excavation or
17 deployment outside of the current site of the facility for personal wireless service.
18 4. If an applicant to modify a facility for personal wireless service asserts in
19 writing that the application meets the requirements of subsection 2, the land use
20 authority:
21 (a) May require the applicant to provide documentation or information
22 regarding the application only to the extent such documentation is reasonably
23 related to the need for the land use authority to determine whether the
24 application meets the requirements of this section; and
25 (b) May not require the applicant to submit any documentation other than as
26 described in paragraph (a), including, without limitation, any documentation
27 supporting the need for the facility for personal wireless service or the decision to
28 modify the facility for personal wireless service.
29 5. For the purposes of subsection 2, the time period within which approval
30 must be granted by a land use authority:
31 (a) Begins to run on the date that the applicant:
32 (1) Takes the first procedural action that the land use authority requires
33 as part of the process for an application to modify a facility for personal wireless
34 service, which must be a single action and may not be a combination or sequence
35 of actions; and
36 (2) If not part of the first procedural action, asserts in writing that the
37 application meets the requirements of subsection 2.
38 (b) May be tolled only by mutual agreement or in accordance with subsection
39 6 if the land use authority determines that the application is incomplete and may
40 not be tolled by a moratorium on the review of applications.
41 6. If a land use authority determines that an application is incomplete:
42 (a) The land use authority shall, not more than 30 days after the date the
43 application is submitted, provide written notice to the applicant that the
44 application is incomplete. The notice must, without limitation, clearly and
45 specifically delineate all missing documents or information in accordance with
46 the documentation and information that may be required pursuant to paragraph
47 (a) of subsection 4.
48 (b) If the land use authority determines that the supplemental documents or
49 information submitted pursuant to paragraph (a) do not satisfy the missing
50 documents or information originally identified pursuant to paragraph (a), the
51 land use authority shall, not more than 10 days after receiving the supplemental
52 documents or information, provide written notice to the applicant that the
53 supplemental documents or information are insufficient. The land use authority

Assembly Amendment No. 478 to Assembly Bill No. 423 Page 15
1 may not request supplemental documents or information that was not originally
2 identified in the notice provided pursuant to paragraph (a).
3 (c) The time period to grant approval is tolled beginning on the date the land
4 use authority sends a written notice to the applicant pursuant to paragraph (a) or
5 (b) and begins running again on the date on which the applicant submits the
6 supplemental documents or information in response to the notice provided
7 pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b).
8 7. If a land use authority fails to approve or deny an application to modify a
9 facility for personal wireless service in not more than 60 days or, if the
10 application is tolled pursuant to subsection 5 or 6, if the land use authority fails
11 to approve or deny such an application in 60 days plus any days in which the
12 application was tolled, the application shall be deemed granted. The approval of
13 an application pursuant to this subsection does not take effect until the date on
14 which the applicant notifies the land use authority in writing that the time period
15 has expired and the application has been deemed granted.] 47 U.S.C. § 332, as
16 amended, 47 U.S.C. § 1455(a) and any applicable rules, interpretations and
17 requirements imposed by the Federal Communications Commission and the
18 Federal Aviation Administration.
19 Sec. 11. NRS 707.550 is hereby amended to read as follows:
20 707.550 As used in NRS 707.550 to 707.585, inclusive, and section 10 of
21 this act, unless the context otherwise requires, the words and terms defined in NRS
22 707.555 to 707.570, inclusive, have the meanings ascribed to them in those
23 sections.
24 Sec. 12. NRS 707.585 is hereby amended to read as follows:
25 707.585 1. A land use authority that denies the approval of an application to
26 construct or modify a facility for personal wireless service shall issue a written
27 decision. The decision must:
28 (a) Set forth with specificity each ground on which the authority denied the
29 approval of the application; and
30 (b) Describe the documents relied upon by the land use authority in making its
31 decision.
32 2. A person who brings an action against a land use authority pursuant to
33 NRS 278.0233 shall file a copy of the decision and record with the court.
