AN ACT relating to business; requiring the Administrator of the
Employment Security Division of the Department of
Employment, Training and Rehabilitation to adopt
regulations establishing a process for certain employers
and employing units to elect not to make contributions
into the Unemployment Compensation Fund; providing
an exemption for certain persons from paying certain fees
for an application and first renewal of a state business
license; establishing requirements relating to the review
and approval of an application to modify a facility for
personal wireless service by certain land use authorities;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under the Unemployment Compensation Law: (1) with certain exceptions,
2 employers and employing units that employ one or more persons are required to
3 pay contributions into the Unemployment Compensation Fund at a certain rate of
4 the wages paid by the employer for employment; and (2) persons who have become
5 unemployed and comply with certain requirements are eligible for benefits from the
6 Unemployment Compensation Fund in an amount based on the person’s previous
7 wages for employment. (Chapter 612 of NRS) Section 3 of this bill: (1) requires the
8 Administrator of the Employment Security Division of the Department of
9 Employment, Training and Rehabilitation to establish by regulation a process for an
10 employer or employing unit that employs only one person who owns the
11 organization, trade or business of the employer or employing unit to elect not to
12 make contributions into the Unemployment Compensation Fund; and (2) provides
13 that if a person makes such an election, he or she is not eligible to receive benefits
14 from the Fund.

15 Section 2 of this bill exempts from the services included in the term
16 “employment” any services performed by a person who has elected not to make
17 contributions on behalf of himself or herself under the regulations adopted pursuant
18 to section 3. Sections 4 and 5 of this bill apply the exemption from the definition
19 of “employment” in section 2 to the provisions of existing law relating to
20 unemployment compensation.
21 Existing law defines “employer” for purposes of an excise tax imposed on
22 employers to mean any employer who is required to pay contributions into the
23 Unemployment Compensation Fund. (NRS 363B.030) Section 9 of this bill
24 includes in this definition any employer who elects not to make contributions
25 pursuant to section 2.
26 Existing law requires a person who applies for a state business license or the
27 renewal of a state business license to pay a fee of $200 or, for certain corporations,
28 $500. (NRS 76.100, 76.130) Section 6 of this bill exempts certain persons from
29 paying a fee for an initial application for a state business license and the first
30 renewal of the state business license if the person: (1) does not qualify for certain
31 existing tax abatements and partial tax abatements; or (2) the person attests that the
32 business will employ a certain number of full-time employees in the county or city
33 of the place of business by the eighth calendar quarter after the initial application
34 fee is waived or will make a certain amount of capital investment in the State not
35 later than 2 years after the initial application fee is waived. Upon the second
36 renewal of a state business license, section 6 requires the Secretary of State to
37 review the records of the business to verify that the business met such criteria and if
38 the business did not, require the person to pay the fees that were waived.
39 Sections 7 and 8 of this bill provide that the exemption provided in section 6 is
40 an exception to the requirement to pay a fee for an application and renewal of a
41 state business license.
42 Existing law requires a land use authority with jurisdiction over an application
43 to construct a facility for personal wireless service to establish procedures and
44 standards for the review and approval of such an application. (NRS 707.575)
45 Section 10 of this bill establishes requirements relating to the review and approval
46 of an application to modify a facility for personal wireless service by a land use
47 authority with jurisdiction over the application.
48 Section 11 of this bill applies certain existing definitions relating to facilities
49 for personal wireless service to section 10. Section 12 of this bill requires that a
50 denial of an application to modify a facility for personal wireless service be in
51 writing.

ASSEMBLY BILL NO. 423–ASSEMBLYMEMBERS COLE;
DELONG, GURR, HAFEN, HANSEN AND HIBBETTS
MARCH 13, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Commerce and Labor
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to business.
(BDR 53-852)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to business; requiring the Administrator of the
Employment Security Division of the Department of
Employment, Training and Rehabilitation to adopt
regulations establishing a process for certain employers
and employing units to elect not to make contributions
into the Unemployment Compensation Fund; providing
an exemption for certain persons from paying certain fees
for an application and first renewal of a state business
license; establishing requirements relating to the review
and approval of an application to modify a facility for
personal wireless service by certain land use authorities;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under the Unemployment Compensation Law: (1) with certain exceptions,
2 employers and employing units that employ one or more persons are required to
3 pay contributions into the Unemployment Compensation Fund at a certain rate of
4 the wages paid by the employer for employment; and (2) persons who have become
5 unemployed and comply with certain requirements are eligible for benefits from the
6 Unemployment Compensation Fund in an amount based on the person’s previous
7 wages for employment. (Chapter 612 of NRS) Section 3 of this bill: (1) requires the
8 Administrator of the Employment Security Division of the Department of
9 Employment, Training and Rehabilitation to establish by regulation a process for an
10 employer or employing unit that employs only one person who owns the
11 organization, trade or business of the employer or employing unit to elect not to
12 make contributions into the Unemployment Compensation Fund; and (2) provides
13 that if a person makes such an election, he or she is not eligible to receive benefits
14 from the Fund.

*AB423*

– 2 –
15 Section 2 of this bill exempts from the services included in the term
16 “employment” any services performed by a person who has elected not to make
17 contributions on behalf of himself or herself under the regulations adopted pursuant
18 to section 3. Sections 4 and 5 of this bill apply the exemption from the definition
19 of “employment” in section 2 to the provisions of existing law relating to
20 unemployment compensation.
21 Existing law defines “employer” for purposes of an excise tax imposed on
22 employers to mean any employer who is required to pay contributions into the
23 Unemployment Compensation Fund. (NRS 363B.030) Section 9 of this bill
24 includes in this definition any employer who elects not to make contributions
25 pursuant to section 2.
26 Existing law requires a person who applies for a state business license or the
27 renewal of a state business license to pay a fee of $200 or, for certain corporations,
28 $500. (NRS 76.100, 76.130) Section 6 of this bill exempts certain persons from
29 paying a fee for an initial application for a state business license and the first
30 renewal of the state business license if the person: (1) does not qualify for certain
31 existing tax abatements and partial tax abatements; or (2) the person attests that the
32 business will employ a certain number of full-time employees in the county or city
33 of the place of business by the eighth calendar quarter after the initial application
34 fee is waived or will make a certain amount of capital investment in the State not
35 later than 2 years after the initial application fee is waived. Upon the second
36 renewal of a state business license, section 6 requires the Secretary of State to
37 review the records of the business to verify that the business met such criteria and if
38 the business did not, require the person to pay the fees that were waived.
39 Sections 7 and 8 of this bill provide that the exemption provided in section 6 is
40 an exception to the requirement to pay a fee for an application and renewal of a
41 state business license.
42 Existing law requires a land use authority with jurisdiction over an application
43 to construct a facility for personal wireless service to establish procedures and
44 standards for the review and approval of such an application. (NRS 707.575)
45 Section 10 of this bill establishes requirements relating to the review and approval
46 of an application to modify a facility for personal wireless service by a land use
47 authority with jurisdiction over the application.
48 Section 11 of this bill applies certain existing definitions relating to facilities
49 for personal wireless service to section 10. Section 12 of this bill requires that a
50 denial of an application to modify a facility for personal wireless service be in
51 writing.
