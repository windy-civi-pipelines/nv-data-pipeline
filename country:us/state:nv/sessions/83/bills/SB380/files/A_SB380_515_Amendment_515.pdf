AN ACT relating to autism; requiring peace officers to complete certain training
concerning autism spectrum disorders; authorizing an applicant for
registration as a registered behavior technician to engage in the
supervised practice of applied behavior analysis under certain
conditions; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires a peace officer, as a condition of certification, to complete training
2 concerning identifying and interacting with persons with developmental disabilities,
3 including, without limitation, autism. (NRS 289.605) Section 3 of this bill requires such
4 training to include at least 4 hours of in-person instruction in certain specific topics relating to
5 autism spectrum disorders. Section 2 of this bill requires continuing education for peace
6 officers to include training in interactions with persons with developmental disabilities,
7 including training on recognizing and responding to persons with an autism spectrum
8 disorder. Section 1 of this bill defines the term “autism spectrum disorder” for the purposes of
9 sections 2 and 3.
10 Existing law provides for the registration of registered behavior technicians who provide
11 applied behavior analysis services under the supervision of a licensed behavior analyst or
12 assistant behavior analyst to persons with autism spectrum disorder in this State. (NRS
13 641D.300, 641D.310, 641D.600, 641D.610) Existing law requires the Board of Applied
14 Behavior Analysis to issue a determination to an applicant for registration as a registered
15 behavior technician not more than 120 days after receiving his or her application for
16 registration. (NRS 641D.310) Section 4 of this bill authorizes an applicant for such
17 registration to engage in the practice of applied behavior analysis under the direct supervision
18 of a licensed behavior analyst until the Board issues a determination [.] if, after a
19 background investigation, the President or Secretary-Treasurer of the Board, or an
20 employee of the Board designated by the Board determines that the applicant has not
21 been convicted of any crime that may disqualify him or her from licensure.
