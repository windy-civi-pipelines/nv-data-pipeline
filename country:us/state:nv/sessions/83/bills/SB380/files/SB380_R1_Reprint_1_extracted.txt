FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to autism; requiring peace officers to complete
certain training concerning autism spectrum disorders;
authorizing an applicant for registration as a registered
behavior technician to engage in the supervised practice
of applied behavior analysis under certain conditions; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires a peace officer, as a condition of certification, to
2 complete training concerning identifying and interacting with persons with
3 developmental disabilities, including, without limitation, autism. (NRS 289.605)
4 Section 3 of this bill requires such training to include at least 4 hours of in-person
5 instruction in certain specific topics relating to autism spectrum disorders. Section
6 2 of this bill requires continuing education for peace officers to include training in
7 interactions with persons with developmental disabilities, including training on
8 recognizing and responding to persons with an autism spectrum disorder. Section 1
9 of this bill defines the term “autism spectrum disorder” for the purposes of sections
10 2 and 3.
11 Existing law provides for the registration of registered behavior technicians
12 who provide applied behavior analysis services under the supervision of a licensed
13 behavior analyst or assistant behavior analyst to persons with autism spectrum
14 disorder in this State. (NRS 641D.300, 641D.310, 641D.600, 641D.610) Existing
15 law requires the Board of Applied Behavior Analysis to issue a determination to an
16 applicant for registration as a registered behavior technician not more than 120 days
17 after receiving his or her application for registration. (NRS 641D.310) Section 4 of
18 this bill authorizes an applicant for such registration to engage in the practice of
19 applied behavior analysis under the direct supervision of a licensed behavior
20 analyst until the Board issues a determination if, after a background investigation,
21 the President or Secretary-Treasurer of the Board, or an employee of the Board
