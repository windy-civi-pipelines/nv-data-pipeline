AN ACT relating to governmental administration; prohibiting certain acts related to
critical infrastructure or used utility wire; establishing requirements
relating to transactions involving used utility wire; providing penalties;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law makes it a gross misdemeanor to knowingly burn stolen metallic wire to
2 remove insulation. (NRS 202.180) Section 1 of this bill sets forth penalties for a person who
3 willfully tampers with or willfully removes, damages or destroys any critical infrastructure.
4 Section 3 of this bill provides that it is unlawful for a person to possess used utility wire
5 unless the person is a certain type of business that may reasonably generate, possess or sell
6 used utility wire or the person possesses documentation proving lawful ownership or
7 possession. Section 4 of this bill prohibits a person from purchasing used utility wire for any
8 purpose unless the seller is a business that may reasonably generate, possess or sell used
9 utility wire or the seller establishes lawful ownership or possession of the used utility wire by
10 providing certain documentation. Section 5 of this bill provides that a person who commits
11 the offense created by section 3 or who violates the provisions of section 4 is guilty of a
12 degree of felonious conduct consistent with the weight of used utility wire involved in the
13 crime.
14 Existing law provides that, under certain circumstances, a person may not sue any
15 political subdivisions for any injury, wrongful death or other damage incurred by the person
16 while committing certain crimes. (NRS 41.0334) Section 5.5 of this bill revises the list of
17 crimes to include the new crime created by section 1.
18 Existing law provides certain restrictions on the purchase or receipt by a junk dealer of
19 metallic wire that has been burned in whole or in part to remove insulation. (NRS 647.035)
20 Sections 14 and 15 of this bill make these restrictions apply instead to the purchase or receipt
21 by a junk dealer of used utility wire.

Assembly Amendment No. 809 to Assembly Bill No. 503 First Reprint Page 4
22 Existing law provides certain restrictions on the sale and purchase of scrap metal and
23 used catalytic converters in this State. (NRS 647.092-647.099). Sections 12 and 13 of this bill
24 exclude used utility wire from the definition of “scrap metal” but include persons who
25 purchase, trade, barter or otherwise receive used utility wire in the definition of “scrap metal
26 processor.” Section 8 of this bill prohibits a scrap metal processor from purchasing or
27 receiving used utility wire from any person other than certain businesses that may reasonably
28 generate, possess or sell used utility wire and persons who provide documentation to establish
29 lawful ownership or possession of used utility wire. Section 10 of this bill provides certain
30 restrictions on the manner by which a scrap metal processor may purchase used utility wire
31 that are substantially similar to the restrictions under existing law on the manner by which a
32 scrap metal processor may purchase a used catalytic converter.
33 Existing law requires a scrap metal processor to maintain certain records of purchases of
34 scrap metal and used catalytic converters. (NRS 647.094, 647.0943) Section 9 of this bill
35 requires a scrap metal processor to maintain records of purchases of used utility wire that are
36 substantially similar to the records that it must maintain under existing law for purchases of
37 used catalytic converters. Section 9 requires a scrap metal processor to maintain these records
38 for a period of not less than 3 years. Section 9 also requires a scrap metal processor to make
39 available to a local law enforcement agency on demand all the used utility wire that it
40 purchases and the records of those purchases.
41 Existing law authorizes a local law enforcement agency to establish an electronic
42 reporting system or to utilize an existing electronic reporting system to receive information
43 relating to the purchase of scrap metal or used catalytic converters by a scrap metal processor
44 that transacts business within the jurisdiction of the local law enforcement agency. If a law
45 enforcement agency establishes or uses such a system, existing law requires each scrap metal
46 processor that transacts business within the jurisdiction of the local law enforcement agency to
47 submit electronically to the local law enforcement agency certain information relating to each
48 purchase of scrap metal and catalytic converters from certain persons. (NRS 647.0945)
49 Section 16 of this bill requires each scrap metal processor to submit electronically to the local
50 law enforcement agency certain additional information if the scrap metal processor purchases
51 used utility wire.
52 Section 17 of this bill provides that a person who violates any provision of section 8, 9 or
53 10 is guilty of a misdemeanor.
54 Section 7 of this bill defines “used utility wire” for the purposes of sections 8-16.
