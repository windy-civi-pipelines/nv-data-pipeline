AN ACT relating to utility wire; prohibiting certain acts related to
used utility wire; establishing requirements relating to
transactions involving used utility wire; providing
penalties; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law makes it a gross misdemeanor to knowingly burn stolen metallic
2 wire to remove insulation. (NRS 202.180) Section 1 of this bill sets forth penalties
3 for a person who willfully removes, damages or destroys any critical electrical
4 infrastructure to obtain used utility wire. Section 3 of this bill provides that it is
5 unlawful for a person to possess used utility wire unless the person is a certain type
6 of business that may reasonably generate, possess or sell used utility wire or the
7 person possesses documentation proving lawful ownership or possession. Section 4
8 of this bill prohibits a person from purchasing used utility wire for any purpose
9 unless the seller is a business that may reasonably generate, possess or sell used
10 utility wire or the seller establishes lawful ownership or possession of the used
11 utility wire by providing certain documentation. Section 5 of this bill provides that
12 a person who commits the offense created by section 3 or who violates the
13 provisions of section 4 is guilty of a degree of felonious conduct consistent with the
14 value of used utility wire involved in the crime.
15 Existing law provides certain restrictions on the purchase or receipt by a junk
16 dealer of metallic wire that has been burned in whole or in part to remove
-
*AB503*
– 2 –
17 insulation. (NRS 647.035) Sections 14 and 15 of this bill make these restrictions
18 apply instead to the purchase or receipt by a junk dealer of used utility wire.
19 Existing law provides certain restrictions on the sale and purchase of scrap
20 metal and used catalytic converters in this State. (NRS 647.092-647.099). Sections
21 12 and 13 of this bill exclude used utility wire from the definition of “scrap metal”
22 but include persons who purchase, trade, barter or otherwise receive used utility
23 wire in the definition of “scrap metal processor.” Section 8 of this bill prohibits a
24 scrap metal processor from purchasing or receiving used utility wire from any
25 person other than certain businesses that may reasonably generate, possess or sell
26 used utility wire and persons who provide documentation to establish lawful
27 ownership or possession of used utility wire. Section 10 of this bill provides certain
28 restrictions on the manner by which a scrap metal processor may purchase used
29 utility wire that are substantially similar to the restrictions under existing law on the
30 manner by which a scrap metal processor may purchase a used catalytic converter.
31 Existing law requires a scrap metal processor to maintain certain records of
32 purchases of scrap metal and used catalytic converters. (NRS 647.094, 647.0943)
33 Section 9 of this bill requires a scrap metal processor to maintain records of
34 purchases of used utility wire that are substantially similar to the records that it
35 must maintain under existing law for purchases of used catalytic converters.
36 Section 9 requires a scrap metal processor to maintain these records for a period of
37 not less than 3 years. Section 9 also requires a scrap metal processor to make
38 available to a local law enforcement agency on demand all the used utility wire that
39 it purchases and the records of those purchases.
40 Existing law authorizes a local law enforcement agency to establish an
41 electronic reporting system or to utilize an existing electronic reporting system to
42 receive information relating to the purchase of scrap metal or used catalytic
43 converters by a scrap metal processor that transacts business within the jurisdiction
44 of the local law enforcement agency. If a law enforcement agency establishes or
45 uses such a system, existing law requires each scrap metal processor that transacts
46 business within the jurisdiction of the local law enforcement agency to submit
47 electronically to the local law enforcement agency certain information relating to
48 each purchase of scrap metal and catalytic converters from certain persons. (NRS
49 647.0945) Section 16 of this bill requires each scrap metal processor to submit
50 electronically to the local law enforcement agency certain additional information if
51 the scrap metal processor purchases used utility wire.
52 Section 17 of this bill provides that a person who violates any provision of
53 section 8, 9 or 10 is guilty of a misdemeanor.
54 Section 7 of this bill defines “used utility wire” for the purposes of
55 sections 8-16.

ASSEMBLY BILL NO. 503–COMMITTEE
ON GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS
(ON BEHALF OF THE JOINT INTERIM STANDING
COMMITTEE ON GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS)
MARCH 24, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Judiciary
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to utility wire.
(BDR 15-394)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: Increases or Newly
Provides for Term of Imprisonment in County or City
Jail or Detention Facility.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to utility wire; prohibiting certain acts related to
used utility wire; establishing requirements relating to
transactions involving used utility wire; providing
penalties; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law makes it a gross misdemeanor to knowingly burn stolen metallic
2 wire to remove insulation. (NRS 202.180) Section 1 of this bill sets forth penalties
3 for a person who willfully removes, damages or destroys any critical electrical
4 infrastructure to obtain used utility wire. Section 3 of this bill provides that it is
5 unlawful for a person to possess used utility wire unless the person is a certain type
6 of business that may reasonably generate, possess or sell used utility wire or the
7 person possesses documentation proving lawful ownership or possession. Section 4
8 of this bill prohibits a person from purchasing used utility wire for any purpose
9 unless the seller is a business that may reasonably generate, possess or sell used
10 utility wire or the seller establishes lawful ownership or possession of the used
11 utility wire by providing certain documentation. Section 5 of this bill provides that
12 a person who commits the offense created by section 3 or who violates the
13 provisions of section 4 is guilty of a degree of felonious conduct consistent with the
14 value of used utility wire involved in the crime.
15 Existing law provides certain restrictions on the purchase or receipt by a junk
16 dealer of metallic wire that has been burned in whole or in part to remove
-
*AB503*

– 2 –
17 insulation. (NRS 647.035) Sections 14 and 15 of this bill make these restrictions
18 apply instead to the purchase or receipt by a junk dealer of used utility wire.
19 Existing law provides certain restrictions on the sale and purchase of scrap
20 metal and used catalytic converters in this State. (NRS 647.092-647.099). Sections
21 12 and 13 of this bill exclude used utility wire from the definition of “scrap metal”
22 but include persons who purchase, trade, barter or otherwise receive used utility
23 wire in the definition of “scrap metal processor.” Section 8 of this bill prohibits a
24 scrap metal processor from purchasing or receiving used utility wire from any
25 person other than certain businesses that may reasonably generate, possess or sell
26 used utility wire and persons who provide documentation to establish lawful
27 ownership or possession of used utility wire. Section 10 of this bill provides certain
28 restrictions on the manner by which a scrap metal processor may purchase used
29 utility wire that are substantially similar to the restrictions under existing law on the
30 manner by which a scrap metal processor may purchase a used catalytic converter.
31 Existing law requires a scrap metal processor to maintain certain records of
32 purchases of scrap metal and used catalytic converters. (NRS 647.094, 647.0943)
33 Section 9 of this bill requires a scrap metal processor to maintain records of
34 purchases of used utility wire that are substantially similar to the records that it
35 must maintain under existing law for purchases of used catalytic converters.
36 Section 9 requires a scrap metal processor to maintain these records for a period of
37 not less than 3 years. Section 9 also requires a scrap metal processor to make
38 available to a local law enforcement agency on demand all the used utility wire that
39 it purchases and the records of those purchases.
40 Existing law authorizes a local law enforcement agency to establish an
41 electronic reporting system or to utilize an existing electronic reporting system to
42 receive information relating to the purchase of scrap metal or used catalytic
43 converters by a scrap metal processor that transacts business within the jurisdiction
44 of the local law enforcement agency. If a law enforcement agency establishes or
45 uses such a system, existing law requires each scrap metal processor that transacts
46 business within the jurisdiction of the local law enforcement agency to submit
47 electronically to the local law enforcement agency certain information relating to
48 each purchase of scrap metal and catalytic converters from certain persons. (NRS
49 647.0945) Section 16 of this bill requires each scrap metal processor to submit
50 electronically to the local law enforcement agency certain additional information if
51 the scrap metal processor purchases used utility wire.
52 Section 17 of this bill provides that a person who violates any provision of
53 section 8, 9 or 10 is guilty of a misdemeanor.
54 Section 7 of this bill defines “used utility wire” for the purposes of
55 sections 8-16.

SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
