EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to [utility wire;] governmental administration; prohibiting
certain acts related to critical infrastructure or used utility wire;
establishing requirements relating to transactions involving used utility
wire; providing penalties; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law makes it a gross misdemeanor to knowingly burn stolen metallic wire to
2 remove insulation. (NRS 202.180) Section 1 of this bill sets forth penalties for a person who
3 willfully tampers with or willfully removes, damages or destroys any critical [electrical]
4 infrastructure . [to obtain used utility wire.]
5 Section 3 of this bill provides that it is unlawful for a person to possess used utility wire
6 unless the person is a certain type of business that may reasonably generate, possess or sell
7 used utility wire or the person possesses documentation proving lawful ownership or
8 possession. Section 4 of this bill prohibits a person from purchasing used utility wire for any
9 purpose unless the seller is a business that may reasonably generate, possess or sell used
10 utility wire or the seller establishes lawful ownership or possession of the used utility wire by
11 providing certain documentation. Section 5 of this bill provides that a person who commits
12 the offense created by section 3 or who violates the provisions of section 4 is guilty of a
13 degree of felonious conduct consistent with the [value] weight of used utility wire involved in
14 the crime.
15 Existing law provides that, under certain circumstances, a person may not sue any
16 political subdivisions for any injury, wrongful death or other damage incurred by the
17 person while committing certain crimes. Section 5.5 of this bill revises the list of crimes
18 to include the new crime created by section 1.
19 Existing law provides certain restrictions on the purchase or receipt by a junk dealer of
20 metallic wire that has been burned in whole or in part to remove insulation. (NRS 647.035)
Assembly Amendment No. 407 to Assembly Bill No. 503 Page 4
21 Sections 14 and 15 of this bill make these restrictions apply instead to the purchase or receipt
22 by a junk dealer of used utility wire.
23 Existing law provides certain restrictions on the sale and purchase of scrap metal and
24 used catalytic converters in this State. (NRS 647.092-647.099). Sections 12 and 13 of this bill
25 exclude used utility wire from the definition of “scrap metal” but include persons who
26 purchase, trade, barter or otherwise receive used utility wire in the definition of “scrap metal
27 processor.” Section 8 of this bill prohibits a scrap metal processor from purchasing or
28 receiving used utility wire from any person other than certain businesses that may reasonably
29 generate, possess or sell used utility wire and persons who provide documentation to establish
30 lawful ownership or possession of used utility wire. Section 10 of this bill provides certain
31 restrictions on the manner by which a scrap metal processor may purchase used utility wire
32 that are substantially similar to the restrictions under existing law on the manner by which a
33 scrap metal processor may purchase a used catalytic converter.
34 Existing law requires a scrap metal processor to maintain certain records of purchases of
35 scrap metal and used catalytic converters. (NRS 647.094, 647.0943) Section 9 of this bill
36 requires a scrap metal processor to maintain records of purchases of used utility wire that are
37 substantially similar to the records that it must maintain under existing law for purchases of
38 used catalytic converters. Section 9 requires a scrap metal processor to maintain these records
39 for a period of not less than 3 years. Section 9 also requires a scrap metal processor to make
40 available to a local law enforcement agency on demand all the used utility wire that it
41 purchases and the records of those purchases.
42 Existing law authorizes a local law enforcement agency to establish an electronic
43 reporting system or to utilize an existing electronic reporting system to receive information
44 relating to the purchase of scrap metal or used catalytic converters by a scrap metal processor
45 that transacts business within the jurisdiction of the local law enforcement agency. If a law
46 enforcement agency establishes or uses such a system, existing law requires each scrap metal
47 processor that transacts business within the jurisdiction of the local law enforcement agency to
48 submit electronically to the local law enforcement agency certain information relating to each
49 purchase of scrap metal and catalytic converters from certain persons. (NRS 647.0945)
50 Section 16 of this bill requires each scrap metal processor to submit electronically to the local
51 law enforcement agency certain additional information if the scrap metal processor purchases
52 used utility wire.
53 Section 17 of this bill provides that a person who violates any provision of section 8, 9 or
54 10 is guilty of a misdemeanor.
55 Section 7 of this bill defines “used utility wire” for the purposes of sections 8-16.

Referred to Committee on Judiciary
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to [utility wire.] governmental
administration. (BDR 15-394)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: Increases or Newly Provides for
Term of Imprisonment in County or City Jail or Detention
Facility.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to [utility wire;] governmental administration; prohibiting
certain acts related to critical infrastructure or used utility wire;
establishing requirements relating to transactions involving used utility
wire; providing penalties; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law makes it a gross misdemeanor to knowingly burn stolen metallic wire to
2 remove insulation. (NRS 202.180) Section 1 of this bill sets forth penalties for a person who
3 willfully tampers with or willfully removes, damages or destroys any critical [electrical]
4 infrastructure . [to obtain used utility wire.]
5 Section 3 of this bill provides that it is unlawful for a person to possess used utility wire
6 unless the person is a certain type of business that may reasonably generate, possess or sell
7 used utility wire or the person possesses documentation proving lawful ownership or
8 possession. Section 4 of this bill prohibits a person from purchasing used utility wire for any
9 purpose unless the seller is a business that may reasonably generate, possess or sell used
10 utility wire or the seller establishes lawful ownership or possession of the used utility wire by
11 providing certain documentation. Section 5 of this bill provides that a person who commits
12 the offense created by section 3 or who violates the provisions of section 4 is guilty of a
13 degree of felonious conduct consistent with the [value] weight of used utility wire involved in
14 the crime.
15 Existing law provides that, under certain circumstances, a person may not sue any
16 political subdivisions for any injury, wrongful death or other damage incurred by the
17 person while committing certain crimes. Section 5.5 of this bill revises the list of crimes
18 to include the new crime created by section 1.
19 Existing law provides certain restrictions on the purchase or receipt by a junk dealer of
20 metallic wire that has been burned in whole or in part to remove insulation. (NRS 647.035)

Assembly Amendment No. 407 to Assembly Bill No. 503 Page 4
21 Sections 14 and 15 of this bill make these restrictions apply instead to the purchase or receipt
22 by a junk dealer of used utility wire.
23 Existing law provides certain restrictions on the sale and purchase of scrap metal and
24 used catalytic converters in this State. (NRS 647.092-647.099). Sections 12 and 13 of this bill
25 exclude used utility wire from the definition of “scrap metal” but include persons who
26 purchase, trade, barter or otherwise receive used utility wire in the definition of “scrap metal
27 processor.” Section 8 of this bill prohibits a scrap metal processor from purchasing or
28 receiving used utility wire from any person other than certain businesses that may reasonably
29 generate, possess or sell used utility wire and persons who provide documentation to establish
30 lawful ownership or possession of used utility wire. Section 10 of this bill provides certain
31 restrictions on the manner by which a scrap metal processor may purchase used utility wire
32 that are substantially similar to the restrictions under existing law on the manner by which a
33 scrap metal processor may purchase a used catalytic converter.
34 Existing law requires a scrap metal processor to maintain certain records of purchases of
35 scrap metal and used catalytic converters. (NRS 647.094, 647.0943) Section 9 of this bill
36 requires a scrap metal processor to maintain records of purchases of used utility wire that are
37 substantially similar to the records that it must maintain under existing law for purchases of
38 used catalytic converters. Section 9 requires a scrap metal processor to maintain these records
39 for a period of not less than 3 years. Section 9 also requires a scrap metal processor to make
40 available to a local law enforcement agency on demand all the used utility wire that it
41 purchases and the records of those purchases.
42 Existing law authorizes a local law enforcement agency to establish an electronic
43 reporting system or to utilize an existing electronic reporting system to receive information
44 relating to the purchase of scrap metal or used catalytic converters by a scrap metal processor
45 that transacts business within the jurisdiction of the local law enforcement agency. If a law
46 enforcement agency establishes or uses such a system, existing law requires each scrap metal
47 processor that transacts business within the jurisdiction of the local law enforcement agency to
48 submit electronically to the local law enforcement agency certain information relating to each
49 purchase of scrap metal and catalytic converters from certain persons. (NRS 647.0945)
50 Section 16 of this bill requires each scrap metal processor to submit electronically to the local
51 law enforcement agency certain additional information if the scrap metal processor purchases
52 used utility wire.
53 Section 17 of this bill provides that a person who violates any provision of section 8, 9 or
54 10 is guilty of a misdemeanor.
55 Section 7 of this bill defines “used utility wire” for the purposes of sections 8-16.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 202 of NRS is hereby amended by adding thereto a new
