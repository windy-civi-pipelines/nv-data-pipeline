EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to governmental administration; prohibiting
certain acts related to critical infrastructure or used utility
wire; establishing requirements relating to transactions
involving used utility wire; providing penalties; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law makes it a gross misdemeanor to knowingly burn stolen metallic
2 wire to remove insulation. (NRS 202.180) Section 1 of this bill sets forth penalties
3 for a person who willfully tampers with or willfully removes, damages or destroys
4 any critical infrastructure.
5 Section 3 of this bill provides that it is unlawful for a person to possess used
6 utility wire unless the person is a certain type of business that may reasonably
7 generate, possess or sell used utility wire or the person possesses documentation
8 proving lawful ownership or possession. Section 4 of this bill prohibits a person
9 from purchasing used utility wire for any purpose unless the seller is a business that
10 may reasonably generate, possess or sell used utility wire or the seller establishes
11 lawful ownership or possession of the used utility wire by providing certain
12 documentation. Section 5 of this bill provides that a person who commits the
13 offense created by section 3 or who violates the provisions of section 4 is guilty of
14 a degree of felonious conduct consistent with the weight of used utility wire
15 involved in the crime.
16 Existing law provides that, under certain circumstances, a person may not sue
17 any political subdivisions for any injury, wrongful death or other damage incurred

18 by the person while committing certain crimes. (NRS 41.0334) Section 5.5 of this
19 bill revises the list of crimes to include the new crime created by section 1.
20 Existing law provides certain restrictions on the purchase or receipt by a junk
21 dealer of metallic wire that has been burned in whole or in part to remove
22 insulation. (NRS 647.035) Sections 14 and 15 of this bill make these restrictions
23 apply instead to the purchase or receipt by a junk dealer of used utility wire.
24 Existing law provides certain restrictions on the sale and purchase of scrap
25 metal and used catalytic converters in this State. (NRS 647.092-647.099). Sections
26 12 and 13 of this bill exclude used utility wire from the definition of “scrap metal”
27 but include persons who purchase, trade, barter or otherwise receive used utility
28 wire in the definition of “scrap metal processor.” Section 8 of this bill prohibits a
29 scrap metal processor from purchasing or receiving used utility wire from any
30 person other than certain businesses that may reasonably generate, possess or sell
31 used utility wire and persons who provide documentation to establish lawful
32 ownership or possession of used utility wire. Section 10 of this bill provides certain
33 restrictions on the manner by which a scrap metal processor may purchase used
34 utility wire that are substantially similar to the restrictions under existing law on the
35 manner by which a scrap metal processor may purchase a used catalytic converter.
36 Existing law requires a scrap metal processor to maintain certain records of
37 purchases of scrap metal and used catalytic converters. (NRS 647.094, 647.0943)
38 Section 9 of this bill requires a scrap metal processor to maintain records of
39 purchases of used utility wire that are substantially similar to the records that it
40 must maintain under existing law for purchases of used catalytic converters.
41 Section 9 requires a scrap metal processor to maintain these records for a period of
42 not less than 3 years. Section 9 also requires a scrap metal processor to make
43 available to a local law enforcement agency on demand all the used utility wire that
44 it purchases and the records of those purchases.
45 Existing law authorizes a local law enforcement agency to establish an
46 electronic reporting system or to utilize an existing electronic reporting system to
47 receive information relating to the purchase of scrap metal or used catalytic
48 converters by a scrap metal processor that transacts business within the jurisdiction
49 of the local law enforcement agency. If a law enforcement agency establishes or
50 uses such a system, existing law requires each scrap metal processor that transacts
51 business within the jurisdiction of the local law enforcement agency to submit
52 electronically to the local law enforcement agency certain information relating to
53 each purchase of scrap metal and catalytic converters from certain persons. (NRS
54 647.0945) Section 16 of this bill requires each scrap metal processor to submit
55 electronically to the local law enforcement agency certain additional information if
56 the scrap metal processor purchases used utility wire.
57 Section 17 of this bill provides that a person who violates any provision of
58 section 8, 9 or 10 is guilty of a misdemeanor.
59 Section 7 of this bill defines “used utility wire” for the purposes of
60 sections 8-16.

(Reprinted with amendments adopted on May 26, 2025)
SECOND REPRINT A.B. 503
ASSEMBLY BILL NO. 503–COMMITTEE
ON GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS
(ON BEHALF OF THE JOINT INTERIM STANDING
COMMITTEE ON GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS)
MARCH 24, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Judiciary
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to governmental
administration. (BDR 15-394)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: Increases or Newly
Provides for Term of Imprisonment in County or City
Jail or Detention Facility.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to governmental administration; prohibiting
certain acts related to critical infrastructure or used utility
wire; establishing requirements relating to transactions
involving used utility wire; providing penalties; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law makes it a gross misdemeanor to knowingly burn stolen metallic
2 wire to remove insulation. (NRS 202.180) Section 1 of this bill sets forth penalties
3 for a person who willfully tampers with or willfully removes, damages or destroys
4 any critical infrastructure.
5 Section 3 of this bill provides that it is unlawful for a person to possess used
6 utility wire unless the person is a certain type of business that may reasonably
7 generate, possess or sell used utility wire or the person possesses documentation
8 proving lawful ownership or possession. Section 4 of this bill prohibits a person
9 from purchasing used utility wire for any purpose unless the seller is a business that
10 may reasonably generate, possess or sell used utility wire or the seller establishes
11 lawful ownership or possession of the used utility wire by providing certain
12 documentation. Section 5 of this bill provides that a person who commits the
13 offense created by section 3 or who violates the provisions of section 4 is guilty of
14 a degree of felonious conduct consistent with the weight of used utility wire
15 involved in the crime.
16 Existing law provides that, under certain circumstances, a person may not sue
17 any political subdivisions for any injury, wrongful death or other damage incurred
-
*AB503_R2*

– 2 –
18 by the person while committing certain crimes. (NRS 41.0334) Section 5.5 of this
19 bill revises the list of crimes to include the new crime created by section 1.
20 Existing law provides certain restrictions on the purchase or receipt by a junk
21 dealer of metallic wire that has been burned in whole or in part to remove
22 insulation. (NRS 647.035) Sections 14 and 15 of this bill make these restrictions
23 apply instead to the purchase or receipt by a junk dealer of used utility wire.
24 Existing law provides certain restrictions on the sale and purchase of scrap
25 metal and used catalytic converters in this State. (NRS 647.092-647.099). Sections
26 12 and 13 of this bill exclude used utility wire from the definition of “scrap metal”
27 but include persons who purchase, trade, barter or otherwise receive used utility
28 wire in the definition of “scrap metal processor.” Section 8 of this bill prohibits a
29 scrap metal processor from purchasing or receiving used utility wire from any
30 person other than certain businesses that may reasonably generate, possess or sell
31 used utility wire and persons who provide documentation to establish lawful
32 ownership or possession of used utility wire. Section 10 of this bill provides certain
33 restrictions on the manner by which a scrap metal processor may purchase used
34 utility wire that are substantially similar to the restrictions under existing law on the
35 manner by which a scrap metal processor may purchase a used catalytic converter.
36 Existing law requires a scrap metal processor to maintain certain records of
37 purchases of scrap metal and used catalytic converters. (NRS 647.094, 647.0943)
38 Section 9 of this bill requires a scrap metal processor to maintain records of
39 purchases of used utility wire that are substantially similar to the records that it
40 must maintain under existing law for purchases of used catalytic converters.
41 Section 9 requires a scrap metal processor to maintain these records for a period of
42 not less than 3 years. Section 9 also requires a scrap metal processor to make
43 available to a local law enforcement agency on demand all the used utility wire that
44 it purchases and the records of those purchases.
45 Existing law authorizes a local law enforcement agency to establish an
46 electronic reporting system or to utilize an existing electronic reporting system to
47 receive information relating to the purchase of scrap metal or used catalytic
48 converters by a scrap metal processor that transacts business within the jurisdiction
49 of the local law enforcement agency. If a law enforcement agency establishes or
50 uses such a system, existing law requires each scrap metal processor that transacts
51 business within the jurisdiction of the local law enforcement agency to submit
52 electronically to the local law enforcement agency certain information relating to
53 each purchase of scrap metal and catalytic converters from certain persons. (NRS
54 647.0945) Section 16 of this bill requires each scrap metal processor to submit
55 electronically to the local law enforcement agency certain additional information if
56 the scrap metal processor purchases used utility wire.
57 Section 17 of this bill provides that a person who violates any provision of
58 section 8, 9 or 10 is guilty of a misdemeanor.
59 Section 7 of this bill defines “used utility wire” for the purposes of
60 sections 8-16.

SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 202 of NRS is hereby amended by adding
2 thereto a new section to read as follows:
