Section 1:
on Government Affairs
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to governmental administration; prohibiting
certain acts related to critical infrastructure or used utility
wire; establishing requirements relating to transactions
involving used utility wire; providing penalties; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law makes it a gross misdemeanor to knowingly burn stolen metallic
wire to remove insulation. (NRS 202.180) Section 1 of this bill sets forth penalties
for a person who willfully tampers with or willfully removes, damages or destroys
any critical infrastructure.

Section 2:
Section 3 of this bill provides that it is unlawful for a person to possess used
utility wire unless the person is a certain type of business that may reasonably
generate, possess or sell used utility wire or the person possesses documentation
proving lawful ownership or possession. Section 4 of this bill prohibits a person
from purchasing used utility wire for any purpose unless the seller is a business that
may reasonably generate, possess or sell used utility wire or the seller establishes
lawful ownership or possession of the used utility wire by providing certain
documentation. Section 5 of this bill provides that a person who commits the
offense created by section 3 or who violates the provisions of section 4 is guilty of
a degree of felonious conduct consistent with the weight of used utility wire
involved in the crime.
Existing law provides that, under certain circumstances, a person may not sue
any political subdivisions for any injury, wrongful death or other damage incurred
by the person while committing certain crimes. (NRS 41.0334) Section 5.5 of this
bill revises the list of crimes to include the new crime created by section 1.
Existing law provides certain restrictions on the purchase or receipt by a junk
dealer of metallic wire that has been burned in whole or in part to remove
insulation. (NRS 647.035) Sections 14 and 15 of this bill make these restrictions
apply instead to the purchase or receipt by a junk dealer of used utility wire.
Existing law provides certain restrictions on the sale and purchase of scrap
metal and used catalytic converters in this State. (NRS 647.092-647.099). Sections
12 and 13 of this bill exclude used utility wire from the definition of “scrap metal”
but include persons who purchase, trade, barter or otherwise receive used utility
wire in the definition of “scrap metal processor.” Section 8 of this bill prohibits a
scrap metal processor from purchasing or receiving used utility wire from any
person other than certain businesses that may reasonably generate, possess or sell
used utility wire and persons who provide documentation to establish lawful
ownership or possession of used utility wire. Section 10 of this bill provides certain
restrictions on the manner by which a scrap metal processor may purchase used
utility wire that are substantially similar to the restrictions under existing law on the
manner by which a scrap metal processor may purchase a used catalytic converter.
Existing law requires a scrap metal processor to maintain certain records of
purchases of scrap metal and used catalytic converters. (NRS 647.094, 647.0943)

Section 3:
Section 9 of this bill requires a scrap metal processor to maintain records of
purchases of used utility wire that are substantially similar to the records that it
must maintain under existing law for purchases of used catalytic converters.

Section 4:
Section 9 requires a scrap metal processor to maintain these records for a period of
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 2 –
not less than 3 years. Section 9 also requires a scrap metal processor to make
available to a local law enforcement agency on demand all the used utility wire that
it purchases and the records of those purchases.
Existing law authorizes a local law enforcement agency to establish an
electronic reporting system or to utilize an existing electronic reporting system to
receive information relating to the purchase of scrap metal or used catalytic
converters by a scrap metal processor that transacts business within the jurisdiction
of the local law enforcement agency. If a law enforcement agency establishes or
uses such a system, existing law requires each scrap metal processor that transacts
business within the jurisdiction of the local law enforcement agency to submit
electronically to the local law enforcement agency certain information relating to
each purchase of scrap metal and catalytic converters from certain persons. (NRS

Section 5:
647.0945) Section 16 of this bill requires each scrap metal processor to submit
electronically to the local law enforcement agency certain additional information if
the scrap metal processor purchases used utility wire.

Section 6:
Section 17 of this bill provides that a person who violates any provision of

Section 7:
section 8, 9 or 10 is guilty of a misdemeanor.

Section 8:
Section 7 of this bill defines “used utility wire” for the purposes of

Section 9:
sections 8-16.

Raw Text:
Assembly Bill No. 503–Committee
on Government Affairs
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to governmental administration; prohibiting
certain acts related to critical infrastructure or used utility
wire; establishing requirements relating to transactions
involving used utility wire; providing penalties; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law makes it a gross misdemeanor to knowingly burn stolen metallic
wire to remove insulation. (NRS 202.180) Section 1 of this bill sets forth penalties
for a person who willfully tampers with or willfully removes, damages or destroys
any critical infrastructure.
Section 3 of this bill provides that it is unlawful for a person to possess used
utility wire unless the person is a certain type of business that may reasonably
generate, possess or sell used utility wire or the person possesses documentation
proving lawful ownership or possession. Section 4 of this bill prohibits a person
from purchasing used utility wire for any purpose unless the seller is a business that
may reasonably generate, possess or sell used utility wire or the seller establishes
lawful ownership or possession of the used utility wire by providing certain
documentation. Section 5 of this bill provides that a person who commits the
offense created by section 3 or who violates the provisions of section 4 is guilty of
a degree of felonious conduct consistent with the weight of used utility wire
involved in the crime.
Existing law provides that, under certain circumstances, a person may not sue
any political subdivisions for any injury, wrongful death or other damage incurred
by the person while committing certain crimes. (NRS 41.0334) Section 5.5 of this
bill revises the list of crimes to include the new crime created by section 1.
Existing law provides certain restrictions on the purchase or receipt by a junk
dealer of metallic wire that has been burned in whole or in part to remove
insulation. (NRS 647.035) Sections 14 and 15 of this bill make these restrictions
apply instead to the purchase or receipt by a junk dealer of used utility wire.
Existing law provides certain restrictions on the sale and purchase of scrap
metal and used catalytic converters in this State. (NRS 647.092-647.099). Sections
12 and 13 of this bill exclude used utility wire from the definition of “scrap metal”
but include persons who purchase, trade, barter or otherwise receive used utility
wire in the definition of “scrap metal processor.” Section 8 of this bill prohibits a
scrap metal processor from purchasing or receiving used utility wire from any
person other than certain businesses that may reasonably generate, possess or sell
used utility wire and persons who provide documentation to establish lawful
ownership or possession of used utility wire. Section 10 of this bill provides certain
restrictions on the manner by which a scrap metal processor may purchase used
utility wire that are substantially similar to the restrictions under existing law on the
manner by which a scrap metal processor may purchase a used catalytic converter.
Existing law requires a scrap metal processor to maintain certain records of
purchases of scrap metal and used catalytic converters. (NRS 647.094, 647.0943)
Section 9 of this bill requires a scrap metal processor to maintain records of
purchases of used utility wire that are substantially similar to the records that it
must maintain under existing law for purchases of used catalytic converters.
Section 9 requires a scrap metal processor to maintain these records for a period of
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 2 –
not less than 3 years. Section 9 also requires a scrap metal processor to make
available to a local law enforcement agency on demand all the used utility wire that
it purchases and the records of those purchases.
Existing law authorizes a local law enforcement agency to establish an
electronic reporting system or to utilize an existing electronic reporting system to
receive information relating to the purchase of scrap metal or used catalytic
converters by a scrap metal processor that transacts business within the jurisdiction
of the local law enforcement agency. If a law enforcement agency establishes or
uses such a system, existing law requires each scrap metal processor that transacts
business within the jurisdiction of the local law enforcement agency to submit
electronically to the local law enforcement agency certain information relating to
each purchase of scrap metal and catalytic converters from certain persons. (NRS
647.0945) Section 16 of this bill requires each scrap metal processor to submit
electronically to the local law enforcement agency certain additional information if
the scrap metal processor purchases used utility wire.
Section 17 of this bill provides that a person who violates any provision of
section 8, 9 or 10 is guilty of a misdemeanor.
Section 7 of this bill defines “used utility wire” for the purposes of
sections 8-16.
