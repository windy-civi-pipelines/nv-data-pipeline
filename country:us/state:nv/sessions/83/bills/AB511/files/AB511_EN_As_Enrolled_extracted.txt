Existing law authorizes a person insured under a policy of individual health

benefits, under certain circumstances, to the provider of health care who provided
the services covered by the policy. (NRS 689A.135, 689B.040, 689B.100) Sections

Raw Text:
Assembly Bill No. 511–Committee
on Commerce and Labor
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to insurance; revising provisions relating to
reimbursement for certain treatment and services provided by
certain providers of health care; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law entitles an insured to reimbursement for treatment by a
chiropractic physician if a policy of individual health insurance, policy of group
health insurance, nonprofit corporation contract for hospital, medical and dental
services or evidence of coverage of a health maintenance organization provides
coverage for treatment of an illness which is within the authorized scope of practice
of a qualified chiropractic physician. Existing law also contains similar provisions
applicable to: (1) a person who performs acupuncture; (2) a licensed psychologist;
(3) a licensed marriage and family therapist or licensed clinical professional
counselor; (4) a licensed associate in social work, social worker, master social
worker, independent social worker or clinical social worker; (5) a licensed
podiatrist; (6) a licensed clinical drug and alcohol counselor; and (7) certain
registered nurses under certain circumstances. (NRS 608.1575, 689A.0475-
689A.0495, 689B.038-689B.0397, 689B.045, 689B.049, 695B.1951-695B.199,
695C.1765-695C.179) Sections 1-16, 17-24 and 25-33 of this bill revise those
provisions to entitle the insured or the provider who provided treatment to the
insured, as applicable, to reimbursement for the treatment provided.
Existing law authorizes a person insured under a policy of individual health
insurance or policy of group or blanket health insurance to assign his or her right to
benefits, under certain circumstances, to the provider of health care who provided
the services covered by the policy. (NRS 689A.135, 689B.040, 689B.100) Sections
16.5 and 24.5 of this bill similarly authorize a person insured under a contract for
hospital, medical or dental services issued by a nonprofit hospital, medical or dental
services corporation or a health care plan issued by a health maintenance
organization to make such an assignment.
