AN ACT relating to insurance; revising provisions relating to reimbursement for
certain treatment and services provided by certain providers of health
care; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law entitles an insured to reimbursement for treatment by a chiropractic
2 physician if a policy of individual health insurance, policy of group [and blanket] health
3 insurance, nonprofit corporation contract for hospital, medical and dental services or evidence
4 of coverage of a health maintenance organization provides coverage for treatment of an illness
5 which is within the authorized scope of practice of a qualified chiropractic physician. Existing
6 law also contains similar provisions applicable to: (1) a person who performs acupuncture; (2)
7 a licensed psychologist; (3) a licensed marriage and family therapist or licensed clinical
8 professional counselor; (4) a licensed associate in social work, social worker, master social
9 worker, independent social worker or clinical social worker; (5) a licensed podiatrist; (6) a
10 licensed clinical drug and alcohol counselor; and (7) certain registered nurses under certain
11 circumstances. (NRS 608.1575, 689A.0475-689A.0495, 689B.038-689B.0397, 689B.045,
12 689B.049, 695B.1951-695B.199, 695C.1765-695C.179) Sections [1-33] 1-16, 17-24 and 25-
13 33 of this bill revise those provisions to [instead require that] entitle the insured or the
14 provider who provided treatment to the insured [is the person who is entitled] , as applicable,
15 to reimbursement for the treatment provided.
16 Existing law authorizes a person insured under a policy of individual health
17 insurance or policy of group or blanket health insurance to assign his or her right to
18 benefits, under certain circumstances, to the provider of health care who provided the
19 services covered by the policy. (NRS 689A.135, 689B.040, 689B.100) Sections 16.5 and
20 24.5 of this bill similarly authorize a person insured under a contract for hospital,
21 medical or dental services issued by a nonprofit hospital, medical or dental services
22 corporation or a health care plan issued by a health maintenance organization to make
23 such an assignment.

SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to insurance. (BDR 57-697)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to insurance; revising provisions relating to reimbursement for
certain treatment and services provided by certain providers of health
care; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law entitles an insured to reimbursement for treatment by a chiropractic
2 physician if a policy of individual health insurance, policy of group [and blanket] health
3 insurance, nonprofit corporation contract for hospital, medical and dental services or evidence
4 of coverage of a health maintenance organization provides coverage for treatment of an illness
5 which is within the authorized scope of practice of a qualified chiropractic physician. Existing
6 law also contains similar provisions applicable to: (1) a person who performs acupuncture; (2)
7 a licensed psychologist; (3) a licensed marriage and family therapist or licensed clinical
8 professional counselor; (4) a licensed associate in social work, social worker, master social
9 worker, independent social worker or clinical social worker; (5) a licensed podiatrist; (6) a
10 licensed clinical drug and alcohol counselor; and (7) certain registered nurses under certain
11 circumstances. (NRS 608.1575, 689A.0475-689A.0495, 689B.038-689B.0397, 689B.045,
12 689B.049, 695B.1951-695B.199, 695C.1765-695C.179) Sections [1-33] 1-16, 17-24 and 25-
13 33 of this bill revise those provisions to [instead require that] entitle the insured or the
14 provider who provided treatment to the insured [is the person who is entitled] , as applicable,
15 to reimbursement for the treatment provided.
16 Existing law authorizes a person insured under a policy of individual health
17 insurance or policy of group or blanket health insurance to assign his or her right to
18 benefits, under certain circumstances, to the provider of health care who provided the
19 services covered by the policy. (NRS 689A.135, 689B.040, 689B.100) Sections 16.5 and
20 24.5 of this bill similarly authorize a person insured under a contract for hospital,
21 medical or dental services issued by a nonprofit hospital, medical or dental services
22 corporation or a health care plan issued by a health maintenance organization to make
23 such an assignment.
