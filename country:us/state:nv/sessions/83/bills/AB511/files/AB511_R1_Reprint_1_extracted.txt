17 insurance or policy of group or blanket health insurance to assign his or her right to
18 benefits, under certain circumstances, to the provider of health care who provided the
19 services covered by the policy. (NRS 689A.135, 689B.040, 689B.100) Sections 16.5
20 and 24.5 of this bill similarly authorize a person insured under a contract for hospital,
21 medical or dental services issued by a nonprofit hospital, medical or dental services

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law entitles an insured to reimbursement for treatment by a chiropractic
2 physician if a policy of individual health insurance, policy of group health insurance,
3 nonprofit corporation contract for hospital, medical and dental services or evidence of
4 coverage of a health maintenance organization provides coverage for treatment of an
5 illness which is within the authorized scope of practice of a qualified chiropractic
6 physician. Existing law also contains similar provisions applicable to: (1) a person
7 who performs acupuncture; (2) a licensed psychologist; (3) a licensed marriage and
8 family therapist or licensed clinical professional counselor; (4) a licensed associate in
9 social work, social worker, master social worker, independent social worker or
10 clinical social worker; (5) a licensed podiatrist; (6) a licensed clinical drug and alcohol
11 counselor; and (7) certain registered nurses under certain circumstances. (NRS
12 608.1575, 689A.0475-689A.0495, 689B.038-689B.0397, 689B.045, 689B.049,
13 695B.1951-695B.199, 695C.1765-695C.179) Sections 1-16, 17-24 and 25-33 of this
14 bill revise those provisions to entitle the insured or the provider who provided
15 treatment to the insured, as applicable, to reimbursement for the treatment provided.
16 Existing law authorizes a person insured under a policy of individual health
17 insurance or policy of group or blanket health insurance to assign his or her right to
18 benefits, under certain circumstances, to the provider of health care who provided the
19 services covered by the policy. (NRS 689A.135, 689B.040, 689B.100) Sections 16.5
20 and 24.5 of this bill similarly authorize a person insured under a contract for hospital,
21 medical or dental services issued by a nonprofit hospital, medical or dental services
22 corporation or a health care plan issued by a health maintenance organization to make
23 such an assignment.
