AN ACT relating to debt; establishing coerced debt as an affirmative defense in
certain civil actions to collect [a] an unsecured consumer debt; setting
forth requirements for asserting the affirmative defense of coerced
debt; requiring a court to take certain actions upon finding that a
debt is a coerced debt; authorizing certain claims and remedies;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law governs the collection of debt by certain persons in this State, including,
2 without limitation, collection agencies and private debt collectors. (See, e.g., chapters 353C
3 and 649 of NRS) Section 1 of this bill establishes that , in any civil action to collect [a] an
4 unsecured consumer debt, a debtor may assert as an affirmative defense that the debt is a
5 coerced debt . [may be used as an affirmative defense.] Section 1 also: (1) sets forth the
6 requirements for [establishing a prima facie] asserting the affirmative defense of coerced
7 debt; and (2) [defines “coerced debt” to mean a consumer debt or any part thereof which is the
8 proximate result of a person having been a victim of domestic violence, human trafficking,
9 abuse, coercion, fraud, duress, threats, intimidation, manipulation or other unlawful conduct
10 intended to induce the person to incur debt against his or her own will.] requires a court,
11 upon finding that a debt is a coerced debt, to order the creditor to cease collection efforts
12 and, if applicable, correct certain records. In addition, section 1 authorizes: (1) the
13 creditor to join a third party who may be liable for the coerced debt or amend its
14 complaint to assert a claim against any such person; and (2) the debtor to recover
15 attorney’s fees and costs from the person who coerced the debt.
