EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to debt; [prescribing certain requirements relating to the
collection of a debt that is the result of economic abuse or coerced
debt; requiring a reporting agency that receives certain notice that a
debt or any portion of a debt is the result of economic abuse or]
establishing coerced debt [to take] as an affirmative defense in
certain civil actions [;] to collect a consumer debt; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law governs the collection of debt by certain persons in this State, including,
2 without limitation, collection agencies and private debt collectors. (See, e.g., chapters 353C
3 and 649 of NRS) [Existing law also governs: (1) the reporting of certain information
4 concerning consumer credit; and (2) the recording of any such information in the consumer
5 report of a consumer. (Chapter 598C of NRS) In general, sections 1 and 2 of this bill prescribe
6 certain requirements relating to the: (1) collection of a debt that is the result of economic
7 abuse or coerced debt; and (2) inclusion of certain information concerning any such debt on
8 the consumer report of a consumer. Sections 1 and 2 define the term “economic abuse” for the
9 purpose of these requirements to mean any act taken by a person to: (1) obtain control,
10 through coercion, deception, manipulation, undue influence, threats of harm, force or fraud,
11 over another person’s money, assets or property; (2) restrain, sabotage or unreasonably control
12 the ability of another person to acquire, use or maintain economic resources to which the
13 person is entitled; (3) exploit the relationship between the person and another person for
14 financial gain; or (4) exert undue influence over another person’s financial decisions. Sections
15 1 and 2 also define] Section 1 of this bill establishes that in any civil action to collect a
16 consumer debt, a coerced debt may be used as an affirmative defense. Section 1 also: (1)
17 sets forth the requirements for establishing a prima facie affirmative defense of coerced
18 debt; and (2) defines “coerced debt” [for the purpose of these requirements] to mean a
19 consumer debt or any part thereof which is the proximate result of a person having been a
20 victim of [identity theft,] domestic violence, human trafficking, abuse, coercion, fraud,
21 duress, threats, intimidation, manipulation or other unlawful conduct intended to induce the
22 person to incur debt against his or her own will.
23 [Specifically, section 1 requires a creditor to cease any collection efforts related to a debt
24 and provide certain notice concerning the debt to certain reporting agencies if a debtor: (1)
25 asserts that all or any portion of the debt is the result of economic abuse or coerced debt; and
26 (2) provides certain notice and documentation to the creditor concerning the debt. Section 1
Assembly Amendment No. 442 to Assembly Bill No. 250 Page 4
27 also authorizes a creditor to seek a court order declaring that a debt or any portion thereof is
28 not the result of economic abuse or coerced debt and prescribes certain requirements relating
29 to any such order. Finally, section 1 provides that a creditor who violates section 1 is liable in
30 a civil action for the violation.
31 Section 2 requires a reporting agency that receives certain notice that a debt or any
32 portion of a debt is the result of economic abuse or coerced debt to: (1) conduct an
33 investigation concerning the debt; and (2) remove from its files any reference to the debt or
34 any portion of the debt determined by the reporting agency to be the result of economic abuse
35 or coerced debt under certain circumstances.]
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 597 of NRS is hereby amended by adding thereto a new
2 section to read as follows:
3 1. [Except as otherwise provided in subsections 4 and 5, if a debtor asserts
4 that all or any portion of a debt is the result of economic abuse or coerced debt
5 and provides notice and adequate documentation to a creditor, the creditor:
6 (a) Shall:
7 (1) Immediately cease any collection efforts related to the debt, including,
8 without limitation, any effort to collect the debt by:
9 (I) Garnishing the wages, bank account or personal property of the
10 debtor; or
11 (II) Bringing an action to collect the debt;
12 (2) Dismiss any action to collect the debt; and
13 (3) Return any payment made by the debtor on the debt, including,
14 without limitation, any payment executed through a writ of garnishment; and
15 (b) Shall not assign or transfer any claim or account associated with the
16 debt.
17 2. In addition to the requirements prescribed by subsection 1 and except as
18 otherwise provided in subsection 4, if a debtor asserts that all or any part of a
19 debt is the result of economic abuse or coerced debt and provides notice and
20 adequate documentation to a creditor, the creditor shall:
21 (a) Using the contact information provided by the debtor pursuant to
22 subparagraph (4) of paragraph (b) of subsection 3, notify the debtor or person
23 designated by the debtor to receive information concerning the debt, that:
24 (1) The creditor is ceasing any collection efforts related to the debt; and
25 (2) The debtor may request that the creditor provide the notice required
26 by this paragraph in writing;
27 (b) If the creditor does not own the debt, notify the owner of the debt that the
28 creditor is ceasing any collection efforts related to the debt; and
29 (c) Notify any reporting agency to whom the creditor reported information
30 concerning the debt that the debt is the result of economic abuse or coerced debt
31 and request that the reporting agency remove from its files any reference to the
32 debt or any portion of the debt determined by the reporting agency to be the result
33 of economic abuse or coerced debt in accordance with subsection 3 of section 2 of
34 this act.
35 3. The notice provided by a debtor to a creditor described in subsection 1:
36 (a) May be provided orally or in writing; and
37 (b) Must include:
38 (1) Sufficient information for the creditor to identify any claim or
39 account associated with the debt;
Assembly Amendment No. 442 to Assembly Bill No. 250 Page 5
1 (2) A statement that the debt is the result of economic abuse or coerced
2 debt;
3 (3) Information concerning the circumstances under which the debt was
4 incurred, if known; and
5 (4) Contact information that the creditor may use to reach the debtor or a
6 person designated by the debtor to receive information concerning the debt.
7 4. If a creditor finds that the notice provided by a debtor is incomplete or is
8 not accompanied by adequate documentation, the creditor shall, not later than 5
9 business days after receiving the notice, provide to the debtor a specific
10 description of the additional information or documentation required by the
11 creditor. A creditor is not required to comply with subsection 1 until the creditor
12 receives the additional information or documentation requested.
13 5. The requirements prescribed by paragraphs (a) and (b) of subsection 1 do
14 not apply to a creditor who challenges that the debt is not the result of economic
15 abuse or coerced debt in accordance with subsection 6.
16 6. If a creditor has a good faith basis to believe that all or any portion of a
17 debt is not the result of economic abuse or coerced debt, the creditor may seek a
18 court order declaring that the debt or any portion of the debt is not the result of
19 economic abuse or coerced debt. In any such suit:
20 (a) The fact that the debtor provided to the creditor the notice and
21 documentation described in subsection 1 is prima facie evidence that the debt is
22 the result of economic abuse or coerced debt, which must be rebutted by the
23 creditor.
24 (b) The court shall take appropriate steps to protect the debtor and any
25 immediate family member of the debtor from an alleged perpetrator of economic
26 abuse or coerced debt.
27 7. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a creditor from
28 taking any action to collect a debt from a perpetrator of economic abuse or
29 coerced debt.
30 8. A creditor who violates this section is liable in a civil action brought
31 pursuant to this section for actual damages, reasonable attorney’s fees and any
32 punitive damages that the facts may warrant.
33 9. The provisions of this section apply to an action upon a contract filed in
34 any court in this State, regardless of whether the contract contains a choice of
35 law provision which provides that the contract is to be governed or interpreted
36 pursuant to the laws of another state.
37 10.] In any civil action to collect a consumer debt, it is an affirmative
38 defense that the debt is a coerced debt.
39 2. A debtor establishes a prima facie affirmative defense that a debt is a
40 coerced debt by proving that:
41 (a) The debt is a consumer debt accrued in his or her name;
42 (b) The debt was accrued as the proximate result of the debtor having been a
43 victim of domestic violence, human trafficking, abuse, coercion, fraud, duress,
44 threats, intimidation, manipulation or other unlawful conduct; and

AN ACT relating to debt; [prescribing certain requirements relating to the
collection of a debt that is the result of economic abuse or coerced
debt; requiring a reporting agency that receives certain notice that a
debt or any portion of a debt is the result of economic abuse or]
establishing coerced debt [to take] as an affirmative defense in
certain civil actions [;] to collect a consumer debt; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law governs the collection of debt by certain persons in this State, including,
2 without limitation, collection agencies and private debt collectors. (See, e.g., chapters 353C
3 and 649 of NRS) [Existing law also governs: (1) the reporting of certain information
4 concerning consumer credit; and (2) the recording of any such information in the consumer
5 report of a consumer. (Chapter 598C of NRS) In general, sections 1 and 2 of this bill prescribe
6 certain requirements relating to the: (1) collection of a debt that is the result of economic
7 abuse or coerced debt; and (2) inclusion of certain information concerning any such debt on
8 the consumer report of a consumer. Sections 1 and 2 define the term “economic abuse” for the
9 purpose of these requirements to mean any act taken by a person to: (1) obtain control,
10 through coercion, deception, manipulation, undue influence, threats of harm, force or fraud,
11 over another person’s money, assets or property; (2) restrain, sabotage or unreasonably control
12 the ability of another person to acquire, use or maintain economic resources to which the
13 person is entitled; (3) exploit the relationship between the person and another person for
14 financial gain; or (4) exert undue influence over another person’s financial decisions. Sections
15 1 and 2 also define] Section 1 of this bill establishes that in any civil action to collect a
16 consumer debt, a coerced debt may be used as an affirmative defense. Section 1 also: (1)
17 sets forth the requirements for establishing a prima facie affirmative defense of coerced
18 debt; and (2) defines “coerced debt” [for the purpose of these requirements] to mean a
19 consumer debt or any part thereof which is the proximate result of a person having been a
20 victim of [identity theft,] domestic violence, human trafficking, abuse, coercion, fraud,
21 duress, threats, intimidation, manipulation or other unlawful conduct intended to induce the
22 person to incur debt against his or her own will.
23 [Specifically, section 1 requires a creditor to cease any collection efforts related to a debt
24 and provide certain notice concerning the debt to certain reporting agencies if a debtor: (1)
25 asserts that all or any portion of the debt is the result of economic abuse or coerced debt; and
26 (2) provides certain notice and documentation to the creditor concerning the debt. Section 1

Assembly Amendment No. 442 to Assembly Bill No. 250 Page 4
27 also authorizes a creditor to seek a court order declaring that a debt or any portion thereof is
28 not the result of economic abuse or coerced debt and prescribes certain requirements relating
29 to any such order. Finally, section 1 provides that a creditor who violates section 1 is liable in
30 a civil action for the violation.
31 Section 2 requires a reporting agency that receives certain notice that a debt or any
32 portion of a debt is the result of economic abuse or coerced debt to: (1) conduct an
33 investigation concerning the debt; and (2) remove from its files any reference to the debt or
34 any portion of the debt determined by the reporting agency to be the result of economic abuse
35 or coerced debt under certain circumstances.]

SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 597 of NRS is hereby amended by adding thereto a new
2 section to read as follows:
3 1. [Except as otherwise provided in subsections 4 and 5, if a debtor asserts
4 that all or any portion of a debt is the result of economic abuse or coerced debt
5 and provides notice and adequate documentation to a creditor, the creditor:
6 (a) Shall:
7 (1) Immediately cease any collection efforts related to the debt, including,
8 without limitation, any effort to collect the debt by:
9 (I) Garnishing the wages, bank account or personal property of the
10 debtor; or
11 (II) Bringing an action to collect the debt;
12 (2) Dismiss any action to collect the debt; and
13 (3) Return any payment made by the debtor on the debt, including,
14 without limitation, any payment executed through a writ of garnishment; and
15 (b) Shall not assign or transfer any claim or account associated with the
16 debt.
17 2. In addition to the requirements prescribed by subsection 1 and except as
18 otherwise provided in subsection 4, if a debtor asserts that all or any part of a
19 debt is the result of economic abuse or coerced debt and provides notice and
20 adequate documentation to a creditor, the creditor shall:
21 (a) Using the contact information provided by the debtor pursuant to
22 subparagraph (4) of paragraph (b) of subsection 3, notify the debtor or person
23 designated by the debtor to receive information concerning the debt, that:
24 (1) The creditor is ceasing any collection efforts related to the debt; and
25 (2) The debtor may request that the creditor provide the notice required
26 by this paragraph in writing;
27 (b) If the creditor does not own the debt, notify the owner of the debt that the
28 creditor is ceasing any collection efforts related to the debt; and
29 (c) Notify any reporting agency to whom the creditor reported information
30 concerning the debt that the debt is the result of economic abuse or coerced debt
31 and request that the reporting agency remove from its files any reference to the
32 debt or any portion of the debt determined by the reporting agency to be the result
33 of economic abuse or coerced debt in accordance with subsection 3 of section 2 of
34 this act.
35 3. The notice provided by a debtor to a creditor described in subsection 1:
36 (a) May be provided orally or in writing; and
37 (b) Must include:
38 (1) Sufficient information for the creditor to identify any claim or
39 account associated with the debt;

Assembly Amendment No. 442 to Assembly Bill No. 250 Page 5
1 (2) A statement that the debt is the result of economic abuse or coerced
2 debt;
3 (3) Information concerning the circumstances under which the debt was
4 incurred, if known; and
5 (4) Contact information that the creditor may use to reach the debtor or a
6 person designated by the debtor to receive information concerning the debt.
7 4. If a creditor finds that the notice provided by a debtor is incomplete or is
8 not accompanied by adequate documentation, the creditor shall, not later than 5
9 business days after receiving the notice, provide to the debtor a specific
10 description of the additional information or documentation required by the
11 creditor. A creditor is not required to comply with subsection 1 until the creditor
12 receives the additional information or documentation requested.
13 5. The requirements prescribed by paragraphs (a) and (b) of subsection 1 do
14 not apply to a creditor who challenges that the debt is not the result of economic
15 abuse or coerced debt in accordance with subsection 6.
16 6. If a creditor has a good faith basis to believe that all or any portion of a
17 debt is not the result of economic abuse or coerced debt, the creditor may seek a
18 court order declaring that the debt or any portion of the debt is not the result of
19 economic abuse or coerced debt. In any such suit:
20 (a) The fact that the debtor provided to the creditor the notice and
21 documentation described in subsection 1 is prima facie evidence that the debt is
22 the result of economic abuse or coerced debt, which must be rebutted by the
23 creditor.
24 (b) The court shall take appropriate steps to protect the debtor and any
25 immediate family member of the debtor from an alleged perpetrator of economic
26 abuse or coerced debt.
27 7. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a creditor from
28 taking any action to collect a debt from a perpetrator of economic abuse or
29 coerced debt.
30 8. A creditor who violates this section is liable in a civil action brought
31 pursuant to this section for actual damages, reasonable attorney’s fees and any
32 punitive damages that the facts may warrant.
33 9. The provisions of this section apply to an action upon a contract filed in
34 any court in this State, regardless of whether the contract contains a choice of
35 law provision which provides that the contract is to be governed or interpreted
36 pursuant to the laws of another state.
37 10.] In any civil action to collect a consumer debt, it is an affirmative
38 defense that the debt is a coerced debt.
39 2. A debtor establishes a prima facie affirmative defense that a debt is a
40 coerced debt by proving that:
41 (a) The debt is a consumer debt accrued in his or her name;
42 (b) The debt was accrued as the proximate result of the debtor having been a
43 victim of domestic violence, human trafficking, abuse, coercion, fraud, duress,
44 threats, intimidation, manipulation or other unlawful conduct; and
