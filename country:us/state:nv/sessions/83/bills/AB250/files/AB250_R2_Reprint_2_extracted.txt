AN ACT relating to debt; establishing coerced debt as an
affirmative defense in certain civil actions to collect an
unsecured consumer debt; setting forth requirements for
asserting the affirmative defense of coerced debt;
requiring a court to take certain actions upon finding that
a debt is a coerced debt; authorizing certain claims and
remedies; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law governs the collection of debt by certain persons in this State,
2 including, without limitation, collection agencies and private debt collectors. (See,
3 e.g., chapters 353C and 649 of NRS) Section 1 of this bill establishes that, in any
4 civil action to collect an unsecured consumer debt, a debtor may assert as an
5 affirmative defense that the debt is a coerced debt. Section 1 also: (1) sets forth the
6 requirements for asserting the affirmative defense of coerced debt; and (2) requires
7 a court, upon finding that a debt is a coerced debt, to order the creditor to cease
8 collection efforts and, if applicable, correct certain records. In addition, section 1
9 authorizes: (1) the creditor to join a third party who may be liable for the coerced
10 debt or amend its complaint to assert a claim against any such person; and (2) the
11 debtor to recover attorney’s fees and costs from the person who coerced the debt.
