AN ACT relating to debt; prescribing certain requirements relating
to the collection of a debt that is the result of economic
abuse or coerced debt; requiring a reporting agency that
receives certain notice that a debt or any portion of a debt
is the result of economic abuse or coerced debt to take
certain actions; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law governs the collection of debt by certain persons in this State,
2 including, without limitation, collection agencies and private debt collectors. (See,
3 e.g., chapters 353C and 649 of NRS) Existing law also governs: (1) the reporting of
4 certain information concerning consumer credit; and (2) the recording of any such
5 information in the consumer report of a consumer. (Chapter 598C of NRS) In
6 general, sections 1 and 2 of this bill prescribe certain requirements relating to the:
7 (1) collection of a debt that is the result of economic abuse or coerced debt; and (2)
8 inclusion of certain information concerning any such debt on the consumer report
9 of a consumer. Sections 1 and 2 define the term “economic abuse” for the purpose
10 of these requirements to mean any act taken by a person to: (1) obtain control,
11 through coercion, deception, manipulation, undue influence, threats of harm, force
12 or fraud, over another person’s money, assets or property; (2) restrain, sabotage or
13 unreasonably control the ability of another person to acquire, use or maintain
14 economic resources to which the person is entitled; (3) exploit the relationship
15 between the person and another person for financial gain; or (4) exert undue
16 influence over another person’s financial decisions. Sections 1 and 2 also define
17 “coerced debt” for the purpose of these requirements to mean a debt or any part
18 thereof which is the proximate result of a person having been a victim of identity
19 theft, domestic violence, abuse, coercion, fraud, duress, threats, intimidation,
-

– 2 –
20 manipulation or other unlawful conduct intended to induce the person to incur debt
21 against his or her own will.
22 Specifically, section 1 requires a creditor to cease any collection efforts related
23 to a debt and provide certain notice concerning the debt to certain reporting
24 agencies if a debtor: (1) asserts that all or any portion of the debt is the result of
25 economic abuse or coerced debt; and (2) provides certain notice and documentation
26 to the creditor concerning the debt. Section 1 also authorizes a creditor to seek a
27 court order declaring that a debt or any portion thereof is not the result of economic
28 abuse or coerced debt and prescribes certain requirements relating to any such
29 order. Finally, section 1 provides that a creditor who violates section 1 is liable in a
30 civil action for the violation.
31 Section 2 requires a reporting agency that receives certain notice that a debt or
32 any portion of a debt is the result of economic abuse or coerced debt to: (1) conduct
33 an investigation concerning the debt; and (2) remove from its files any reference to
34 the debt or any portion of the debt determined by the reporting agency to be the
35 result of economic abuse or coerced debt under certain circumstances.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN

1 Section 1. Chapter 597 of NRS is hereby amended by adding
2 thereto a new section to read as follows:
3 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsections 4 and 5, if a
4 debtor asserts that all or any portion of a debt is the result of
5 economic abuse or coerced debt and provides notice and adequate
6 documentation to a creditor, the creditor:
7 (a) Shall:
8 (1) Immediately cease any collection efforts related to the
9 debt, including, without limitation, any effort to collect the debt
10 by:
11 (I) Garnishing the wages, bank account or personal
12 property of the debtor; or
13 (II) Bringing an action to collect the debt;
14 (2) Dismiss any action to collect the debt; and

16 including, without limitation, any payment executed through a
17 writ of garnishment; and

23 or coerced debt and provides notice and adequate documentation
24 to a creditor, the creditor shall:
25 (a) Using the contact information provided by the debtor
26 pursuant to subparagraph (4) of paragraph (b) of subsection 3,
-

– 3 –
1 notify the debtor or person designated by the debtor to receive
2 information concerning the debt, that:
3 (1) The creditor is ceasing any collection efforts related to
4 the debt; and
5 (2) The debtor may request that the creditor provide the
6 notice required by this paragraph in writing;
7 (b) If the creditor does not own the debt, notify the owner of
8 the debt that the creditor is ceasing any collection efforts related to
9 the debt; and
10 (c) Notify any reporting agency to whom the creditor reported
11 information concerning the debt that the debt is the result of
12 economic abuse or coerced debt and request that the reporting
13 agency remove from its files any reference to the debt or any
14 portion of the debt determined by the reporting agency to be the
15 result of economic abuse or coerced debt in accordance with
16 subsection 3 of section 2 of this act.
17 3. The notice provided by a debtor to a creditor described in
18 subsection 1:
19 (a) May be provided orally or in writing; and
20 (b) Must include:
21 (1) Sufficient information for the creditor to identify any
22 claim or account associated with the debt;

31 incomplete or is not accompanied by adequate documentation, the
32 creditor shall, not later than 5 business days after receiving the
33 notice, provide to the debtor a specific description of the additional
34 information or documentation required by the creditor. A creditor
35 is not required to comply with subsection 1 until the creditor
36 receives the additional information or documentation requested.
37 5. The requirements prescribed by paragraphs (a) and (b) of
38 subsection 1 do not apply to a creditor who challenges that the
39 debt is not the result of economic abuse or coerced debt in
40 accordance with subsection 6.
41 6. If a creditor has a good faith basis to believe that all or any
42 portion of a debt is not the result of economic abuse or coerced
43 debt, the creditor may seek a court order declaring that the debt or
44 any portion of the debt is not the result of economic abuse or
45 coerced debt. In any such suit:
