EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to state business licenses; requiring the Secretary
of State to waive the fees charged for the issuance and
renewal of a state business license for certain businesses
related to veterans; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires certain businesses to obtain a state business license from
2 the Secretary of State and to pay an annual fee for the renewal of the license. The
3 fee for the issuance and renewal of a state business license is $500 for certain
4 corporations and $200 for certain other businesses. (NRS 76.100, 76.130) Sections
5 1.7 and 1.9 of this bill require the Secretary of State to waive the fee for the
6 issuance of a state business license and, during the first 3 years of the existence of a
7 business, the fee for the renewal of the license if the state business license is issued
8 on or after July 1, 2025, and: (1) the applicant is an eligible veteran; (2) the
9 applicant is a gold star family member; or (3) at least 51 percent of the business is
10 owned by one or more eligible veterans or gold star family members. Section 1.7
11 prohibits the Secretary of State from waiving the fee for the issuance of a state
12 business license if the applicant has already received a waiver for another
13 qualifying business.
14 Sections 1.1 and 1.3 of this bill define the terms “eligible veteran” and “gold
15 star family member,” respectively. Section 1.5 of this bill makes a conforming
16 change to apply the definitions to the provisions of sections 1.7 and 1.9.
