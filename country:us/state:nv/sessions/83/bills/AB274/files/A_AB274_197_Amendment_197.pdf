2 Secretary of State [.] and to pay an annual fee for the renewal of the license. The fee for
3 the issuance and renewal of a state business license is $500 for certain corporations and $200
4 for certain other businesses. (NRS [76.100) This] 76.100, 76.130) Sections 1.7 and 1.9 of this

7 renewal of the license if the state business license is issued on or after July 1, 2025, and: (1)
8 the applicant is an eligible veteran; (2) the applicant is a gold star family member; or (3) at
9 least 51 percent of the business is owned by one or more eligible veterans or gold star family
10 members. Section 1.7 prohibits the Secretary of State from waiving the fee for the
11 issuance of a state business license if the applicant has already received a waiver for
12 another qualifying business.
13 Sections 1.1 and 1.3 of this bill define the terms “eligible veteran” and “gold star
14 family member,” respectively. Section 1.5 of this bill makes a conforming change to
