(BDR 5-495)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.

~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to juvenile justice; revising provisions relating to
the authority of a juvenile court to place a child under
informal supervision under certain circumstances; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, if, after a complaint is made alleging that a child is
2 delinquent or in need of supervision, the district attorney files a petition with the
3 juvenile court, the juvenile court may dismiss the petition without prejudice and
4 refer the child to a probation officer for informal supervision if: (1) the child
5 voluntarily admits participation in the acts alleged in the complaint; and (2) the
6 district attorney gives written approval for the placement of the child under
7 informal supervision, if any of the acts alleged in the complaint are unlawful acts
8 that would have constituted a gross misdemeanor or felony if committed by an
9 adult. (NRS 62C.200, 62C.230) This bill removes these requirements and instead
10 authorizes, with certain exceptions, the juvenile court to dismiss a petition without
11 prejudice and refer such a child to a probation officer for informal supervision if the
12 child voluntarily admits participation in the acts alleged in the petition and: (1) all
13 parties agree to informal supervision; or (2) the juvenile court finds, after a hearing
14 on the matter, that informal supervision is appropriate. This bill provides that the
15 juvenile court may not refer such a child to a probation officer for informal
16 supervision if the petition filed against the child contains an allegation that the child
17 committed an unlawful act which, if committed by an adult, would have constituted
18 certain felonies.
