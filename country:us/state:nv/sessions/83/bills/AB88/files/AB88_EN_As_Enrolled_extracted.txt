Section 1:
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to juvenile justice; revising provisions relating to
the authority of a juvenile court to place a child under
informal supervision under certain circumstances; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Under existing law, if, after a complaint is made alleging that a child is
delinquent or in need of supervision, the district attorney files a petition with the
juvenile court, the juvenile court may dismiss the petition without prejudice and
refer the child to a probation officer for informal supervision if: (1) the child
voluntarily admits participation in the acts alleged in the complaint; and (2) the
district attorney gives written approval for the placement of the child under
informal supervision, if any of the acts alleged in the complaint are unlawful acts
that would have constituted a gross misdemeanor or felony if committed by an
adult. (NRS 62C.200, 62C.230) This bill removes these requirements and instead
authorizes, with certain exceptions, the juvenile court to dismiss a petition without
prejudice and refer such a child to a probation officer for informal supervision if the
child voluntarily admits participation in the acts alleged in the petition and: (1) all
parties agree to informal supervision; or (2) the juvenile court finds, after a hearing
on the matter, that informal supervision is appropriate. This bill provides that the
juvenile court may not refer such a child to a probation officer for informal
supervision if the petition filed against the child contains an allegation that the child
committed an unlawful act which, if committed by an adult, would have constituted
certain felonies.
