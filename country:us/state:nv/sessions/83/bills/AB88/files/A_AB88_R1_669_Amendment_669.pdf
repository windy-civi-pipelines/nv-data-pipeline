AN ACT relating to juvenile justice; revising provisions relating to the authority of
a juvenile court to place a child under informal supervision under
certain circumstances; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, if, after a complaint is made alleging that a child is delinquent or in
2 need of supervision, the district attorney files a petition with the juvenile court, the juvenile
3 court may dismiss the petition without prejudice and refer the child to a probation officer for
4 informal supervision if: (1) the child voluntarily admits participation in the acts alleged in the
5 complaint; and (2) the district attorney gives written approval for the placement of the child
6 under informal supervision, if any of the acts alleged in the complaint are unlawful acts that
7 would have constituted a gross misdemeanor or felony if committed by an adult. (NRS
8 62C.200, 62C.230) This bill removes [the] these requirements [that the district attorney must
9 give written approval and that the child must make certain admissions before] and instead
10 authorizes, with certain exceptions, the juvenile court [may] to dismiss a petition without
11 prejudice and refer such a child to a probation officer for informal supervision [.] if the child
12 voluntarily admits participation in the acts alleged in the petition and: (1) all parties
13 agree to informal supervision; or (2) the juvenile court finds, after a hearing on the
14 matter, that informal supervision is appropriate. This bill provides that the juvenile
15 court may not refer such a child to a probation officer for informal supervision if the
16 petition filed against the child contains an allegation that the child committed an
17 unlawful act which, if committed by an adult, would have constituted certain felonies.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. (Deleted by amendment.)
2 Sec. 2. NRS 62C.230 is hereby amended to read as follows:

1 (a) [Dismiss] Except as otherwise provided in subsection 4, dismiss the
2 petition without prejudice and refer the child to the probation officer for informal
3 supervision [; pursuant to NRS 62C.200;] if the child voluntarily admits
4 participation in the acts alleged in the petition and if:
5 (1) All parties agree to informal supervision; or
6 (2) The juvenile court finds, after a hearing on the matter, that informal
7 supervision is appropriate; or
8 (b) Place the child under the supervision of the juvenile court pursuant to a
9 supervision and consent decree, without a formal adjudication of delinquency, if the
10 juvenile court receives:
11 (1) The recommendation of the probation officer;
12 (2) The written approval of the district attorney; and
13 (3) The written consent and approval of the child and the parent or
14 guardian of the child.
15 2. If a child is placed under the supervision of the juvenile court pursuant to a
16 supervision and consent decree, the juvenile court may dismiss the petition if the
17 child successfully completes the terms and conditions of the supervision and
18 consent decree.
19 3. If the petition is dismissed pursuant to subsection 2:
20 (a) The child may respond to any inquiry concerning the proceedings and
21 events which brought about the proceedings as if they had not occurred; and
22 (b) The records concerning a supervision and consent decree may be
23 considered in a subsequent proceeding before the juvenile court regarding that
24 child.
25 4. The juvenile court may not refer a child to a probation officer for
26 informal supervision pursuant to paragraph (a) of subsection 1 if the petition
27 filed against the child contains allegations that the child committed an unlawful
28 act which, if committed by an adult, would have constituted:
29 (a) A category A felony; or
30 (b) Any other felony involving the use or threatened use of force or violence.
