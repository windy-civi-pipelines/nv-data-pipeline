(ON BEHALF OF THE JOINT INTERIM STANDING
COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY)
PREFILED JANUARY 6, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Judiciary
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to juvenile justice.
(BDR 5-495)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to juvenile justice; revising provisions relating to
the authority of a juvenile court to place a child under
informal supervision under certain circumstances; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, if, after a complaint is made alleging that a child is
2 delinquent or in need of supervision, the district attorney files a petition with the
3 juvenile court, the juvenile court may dismiss the petition without prejudice and
4 refer the child to a probation officer for informal supervision if: (1) the child
5 voluntarily admits participation in the acts alleged in the complaint; and (2) the
6 district attorney gives written approval for the placement of the child under
7 informal supervision, if any of the acts alleged in the complaint are unlawful acts
8 that would have constituted a gross misdemeanor or felony if committed by an
9 adult. (NRS 62C.200, 62C.230) This bill removes the requirements that the district
10 attorney must give written approval and that the child must make certain
11 admissions before the juvenile court may dismiss a petition without prejudice and
12 refer such a child to a probation officer for informal supervision.

15 court pursuant to a supervision and consent decree, the juvenile

22 (b) The records concerning a supervision and consent decree
23 may be considered in a subsequent proceeding before the juvenile
