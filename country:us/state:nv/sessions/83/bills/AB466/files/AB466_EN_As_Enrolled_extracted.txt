Section 1:
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to insurance; revising certain notice requirements
imposed on an insurer who issues a policy of portable
electronics insurance; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law requires an insurer who issues a policy of portable electronics
insurance to provide certain notices that are required to be provided to an enrolled
customer, vendor or other policyholder to be: (1) mailed or delivered; or (2) sent by
electronic mail or other electronic means in accordance with regulations adopted by
the Commissioner of Insurance. (NRS 691D.330) Existing law requires any insurer
to cease delivering any notice or other document by electronic means, and to use an
alternative delivery method, if the insurer: (1) attempts to deliver a notice or other
document by electronic means and has a reasonable basis to believe that the notice
or other document was not received by the party; or (2) becomes aware that the
electronic mail address provided by the party is no longer valid. (NRS 680A.560)
This bill eliminates the requirement that an insurer who issues a policy of
portable electronics insurance and who sends certain notices by electronic mail or
other electronic means do so in accordance with regulations adopted by the
Commissioner. This bill additionally specifies that the requirements setting forth
the circumstances under which an insurer is required to cease delivering a notice or
document by electronic means applies to an insurer who issues a policy of portable
electronics insurance.
