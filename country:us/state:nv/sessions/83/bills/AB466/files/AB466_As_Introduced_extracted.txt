AN ACT relating to insurance; revising certain notice requirements
imposed on an insurer who issues a policy of portable
electronics insurance; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires an insurer who issues a policy of portable electronics
2 insurance to provide certain notices that are required to be provided to an enrolled
3 customer, vendor or other policyholder to be: (1) mailed or delivered; or (2) sent by
4 electronic mail or other electronic means in accordance with regulations adopted by
5 the Commissioner of Insurance. (NRS 691D.330) Existing law requires any insurer
6 to cease delivering any notice or other document by electronic means, and to use an
7 alternative delivery method, if the insurer: (1) attempts to deliver a notice or other
8 document by electronic means and has a reasonable basis to believe that the notice
9 or other document was not received by the party; or (2) becomes aware that the
10 electronic mail address provided by the party is no longer valid. (NRS 680A.560)
11 This bill eliminates the requirement that an insurer who issues a policy of
12 portable electronics insurance and who sends certain notices by electronic mail or
13 other electronic means do so in accordance with regulations adopted by the
14 Commissioner. This bill additionally specifies that the requirements setting forth
15 the circumstances under which an insurer is required to cease delivering a notice or
16 document by electronic means applies to an insurer who issues a policy of portable
17 electronics insurance.
