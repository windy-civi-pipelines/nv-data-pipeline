AN ACT relating to transportation network companies; prohibiting

driver for a transportation network company; requiring
transportation network company insurance to provide
medical payments coverage and uninsured and
underinsured motorist coverage under certain

3 defines the term “transportation network company” to mean an entity that uses a
4 digital network or software application service to connect a passenger to a driver or
5 monitored autonomous vehicle provider who can provide transportation services to
6 the passenger. (NRS 706A.050) Section 1 of this bill prohibits an insurer from
7 denying a claim that arises under a policy of motor vehicle insurance for any
8 accident or motor vehicle crash that occurs during the personal use of the motor
9 vehicle because the insured, claimant or group of insured or claimants is a driver
10 for a transportation network company.
11 Existing law requires a transportation network company or a driver for a
12 transportation network company to provide transportation network company
13 insurance, which may include coverage for medical payments and coverage for
14 uninsured or underinsured motorists. (NRS 690B.470) Section 2 of this bill
15 requires such transportation network company insurance to provide certain medical
16 payments coverage and uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage for any
17 occupant of the motor vehicle.
