EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; [requiring additional support for the State Education
Fund] requiring the Department of Education to award money to
school districts to provide compensation in addition to base pay for
hard-to-fill positions in public schools; requiring [the Superintendent
of Public Instruction to apportion the amount allocated to provide such
compensation among] school districts [on a monthly basis;] to report
certain information relating to hard-to-fill positions; eliminating the
authority in certain large school districts to use weighted funding
provided to a school for certain pupils to pay certain hiring and
retention incentives; revising the powers of the Subcommittee on
Education Accountability of the Interim Finance Committee;
making an appropriation to the Interim Finance Committee for
allocation to the Department to fund compensation in addition to
base pay for hard-to-fill positions in public schools; making an
appropriation to provide money to charter schools for salary
increases for teachers and education support professionals; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 [Existing law creates the State Education Fund for the support of the operation of the
2 public schools in this State and requires that certain revenues of the State be deposited in the
3 Fund. In addition to these revenues, existing law requires support for the State Education Fund
4 to be provided by direct legislative appropriation in an amount determined by the Legislature
5 to be sufficient to fund the operation of public schools in this State for the next ensuing
6 biennium. (NRS 387.1212) After this direct legislative appropriation is made, existing law
7 directs the Legislature to determine the statewide base per pupil funding amount for each
8 fiscal year of the biennium, which is the amount of money on a per pupil basis for the
9 projected enrollment of the public schools in this State which the Legislature determines is
10 sufficient to fund the cost of all public schools in this State to operate and provide general
11 education to all pupils, with the exception of certain expenses for which specific funding is
Assembly Amendment No. 805 to Assembly Bill No. 398 Page 4
12 otherwise provided. (NRS 387.1214)] Section 2 of this bill [requires that additional support
13 for the State Education Fund be provided in an amount determined by the Legislature to be
14 sufficient to ameliorate high teacher vacancy rates by providing] requires the Department of
15 Education, to the extent that money has been appropriated for that purpose, to make
16 awards to school districts to provide compensation, in addition to base pay, for hard-to-fill
17 positions in the public schools of this State. [Sections 2 and 6 of this bill exclude this amount
18 from the calculation of the base per pupil funding amount.] Section 2 defines “hard-to-fill
19 position” as including: (1) teacher positions at certain Title I schools; and (2) teacher positions
20 and other positions filled by licensed educational personnel whose duties include actively
21 teaching pupils in certain subjects which are suffering from a critical labor shortage. [Sections
22 2 and 5 of this bill authorize the money for this amount to be appropriated to the State
23 Education Fund from the State General Fund or transferred, at the direction of the Legislature,
24 from the Education Stabilization Account.
25 Section 3 of this bill requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction to apportion the
26 money appropriated or transferred to the State Education Fund pursuant to section 2 among
27 the school districts in this State, on a monthly basis, according to the yearly apportionment for
28 each school district as specified by the Legislature. Section 3 provides for the reversion of any
29 such money which is not committed for expenditure at the end of each fiscal year.
30 Sections 4, 6 and 7 of this bill exclude certain amounts appropriated or transferred to the
31 State Education Fund pursuant to section 2 from: (1) the money upon which interest is earned
32 for the State Education Fund; and (2) money in the State Education Fund which must be used
33 for certain purposes.] Section 2 requires each school district to submit a biennial report to
34 the Office of Finance in the Office of the Governor and the Interim Finance Committee
35 regarding the number of teachers receiving such additional compensation, the total
36 amount of such additional compensation being provided in the school district and the
37 number of hard-to-fill positions in public schools in the school district. Section 8.9 of this
38 bill imposes certain requirements for the contents of this report which are applicable
39 only to the report that is required to be submitted on or before December 1, 2026.
40 Existing law requires the Governor, to the extent practicable, to include in the
41 proposed executive budget certain recommendations concerning education funding,
42 including recommendations for the statewide base per pupil funding amount and the
43 multiplier for each category of pupils. (NRS 387.12455) Section 8.1 of this bill
44 additionally requires the Governor, to the extent practicable, to include in the proposed
45 executive budget recommendations for the amount of money to appropriate to the
46 Department to make awards to school districts pursuant to section 2.
47 Section 8.5 of this bill appropriates $45,000,000 in both Fiscal Year 2025-2026
48 and Fiscal Year 2026-2027 to the Interim Finance Committee for allocation to the
49 Department to distribute to school districts to provide compensation, in addition to base
50 pay, for hard-to-fill positions in public schools. Section 8.5 establishes certain
51 requirements which must be satisfied before the money is allocated by the Interim
52 Finance Committee.
53 Under the Pupil-Centered Funding Plan, existing law requires a public school that
54 receives weighted funding for one or more at-risk pupils or pupils who are English learners to
55 use such funding only to provide services to such pupils, which are referred to as “Victory
56 services” and “Zoom services,” respectively. (NRS 387.121, 387.12445) Existing law
57 authorizes the use of this weighted funding to provide incentives for hiring and retaining
58 teachers and other licensed educational personnel who provide such services. (NRS
59 387.12445) Section 8 of this bill eliminates the authority to use weighted funding to pay for
60 such incentives [.] in a school district located in a county whose population is 700,000 or
61 more (currently the Clark County School District).
62 Existing law creates the Subcommittee on Educational Accountability of the Interim
63 Finance Committee and authorizes the Subcommittee to study various matters related to
64 accountability in public education. (NRS 218E.415) Section 8.3 of this bill additionally
65 authorizes the Subcommittee to study the compensation paid to teachers at public
66 schools to determine whether such compensation is sufficient to ensure competitiveness
67 with other states and optimal educational achievements and outcomes for pupils.
68 Section 8.7 of this bill appropriates $19,314,297 in both Fiscal Year 2025-2026 and
69 Fiscal Year 2026-2027 to the Interim Finance Committee for allocation to the State
70 Public Charter School Authority to provide money to charter schools for salary
Assembly Amendment No. 805 to Assembly Bill No. 398 Page 5
71 increases for teachers and education support professionals. Section 8.7 requires each
72 charter school in this State to submit certain information to the State Public Charter
73 School Authority, including the number of teachers and education support professionals
74 employed by the charter school on October 1, 2024, and October 1, 2025, and a plan to
75 provide such salary increases in each fiscal year. Section 8.7 requires the State Public
76 Charter School Authority to compile and submit such information to the Interim
77 Finance Committee as a condition for receiving an allocation by the Interim Finance
78 Committee from the appropriation made by section 8.7. Section 8.7 provides the method
79 for calculating the amount of money from the appropriation which the State Public
80 Charter School Authority may distribute to each charter school.

17 positions pursuant to subsection 4 demonstrates that such positions no longer
18 exist at a school district, the Legislature may determine that such funding should

28 the close of the previous fiscal year and before the issuance of the State Controller’s
29 annual report, each county school district shall transfer from the county school
30 district fund to the Education Stabilization Account any amount by which the actual
31 ending fund balance of the county school district fund exceeds 16.6 percent of the
32 total actual expenditures for the fund. The interest and income earned on the money
33 in the Account, after deducting any applicable charges, must be credited to the
34 Account.
35 2. Money transferred pursuant to subsection 1 to the Education Stabilization
36 Account is a continuing appropriation solely for the purpose of authorizing the
37 expenditure of the transferred money for the purposes set forth in this section [.]
38 and section 2 of this act.
39 3. The balance in the Education Stabilization Account must not exceed 20
40 percent of the total of all appropriations and authorizations from the State
41 Education Fund, excluding the Education Stabilization Account, for the
42 immediately preceding fiscal year. Any money transferred to the Education
43 Stabilization Account which exceeds this amount must instead be transferred to the
44 State Education Fund.
45 4. If the Interim Finance Committee finds that:
46 (a) Upon submission of a request from the Department, the actual enrollment
47 growth for a fiscal year exceeds the projected enrollment growth by an amount that
48 the Interim Finance Committee determines would make a transfer of money to the
49 State Education Fund necessary to fund the excess enrollment;
50 (b) The collection of revenue in any fiscal year will result in the State
51 Education Fund receiving less money than authorized for expenditure from the
52 State Education Fund;
Assembly Amendment No. 805 to Assembly Bill No. 398 Page 9
1 (c) Upon submission of a request from the Department, any amount of money
2 which was deposited in the State Education Fund is found by an audit to have been
3 deposited in error; or
4 (d) Upon submission of a request from the Department, any error in the
5 application of the Pupil-Centered Funding Plan by the Department has created a
6 shortfall in the State Education Fund,
7  the Committee shall by resolution establish an amount of money to transfer from
8 the Education Stabilization Account to the State Education Fund and direct the
9 State Controller to transfer that amount to the State Education Fund. The State
10 Controller shall thereupon make the transfer.
11 5. When determining the actual ending fund balance for the purposes of
12 subsection 1, each county school district shall exclude:
13 (a) Any money deposited in the county school district fund on or before June
14 30, 2020;

22 from the State Education Fund to a county school district, charter school or
23 university school for profoundly gifted pupils pursuant to NRS 387.185 exceeds the
24 amount of money available in the State Education Fund because of a delay in
25 expected receipts, he or she may request from the Director of the Office of Finance
26 a temporary advance from the Education Stabilization Account for the payment of
27 such money due. Upon receipt of such a request, the Director of the Office of
28 Finance shall make a recommendation to the Interim Finance Committee to
29 approve the temporary advance in whole or in part or to deny the request. If the
30 Interim Finance Committee approves the request in whole or in part, the Director of
31 the Office of Finance shall notify the State Controller and the Fiscal Analysis
32 Division of the Legislative Counsel Bureau of the amount approved by the Interim
33 Finance Committee, and the State Controller shall draw his or her warrant upon
34 receipt of such a notice of approval. Any money which is temporarily advanced

37 advance is made.
38 7. The balance remaining in the State Education Fund, excluding the balance
39 remaining in the Education Stabilization Account, that has not been committed for
40 expenditure on or before June 30 of an odd-numbered fiscal year must be
41 transferred to the Education Stabilization Account to the extent that such a transfer
42 would not cause the balance in the Education Stabilization Account to exceed the
43 limit established in subsection 3.] (Deleted by amendment.)
44 Sec. 6. [NRS 387.1214 is hereby amended to read as follows:
45 387.1214 1. After a direct legislative appropriation is made to the State
46 Education Fund from the State General Fund pursuant to NRS 387.1212, the
47 Legislature shall determine the statewide base per pupil funding amount for each
48 fiscal year of the biennium, which is the amount of money expressed on a per pupil
49 basis for the projected enrollment of the public schools in this State, determined to
50 be sufficient by the Legislature to fund the costs of all public schools in this State to
51 operate and provide general education to all pupils for any purpose for which
52 specific funding is not appropriated pursuant to paragraph (a), (b) or (e) of
53 subsection 2 or NRS 387.122 [.] or section 2 of this act. It is the intent of the
Assembly Amendment No. 805 to Assembly Bill No. 398 Page 10
1 Legislature that the statewide base per pupil funding amount for any fiscal year, to
2 the extent practicable, be not less than the statewide base per pupil funding amount
3 for the immediately preceding fiscal year, adjusted by the rate of inflation, unless
4 the amount of money contained in the State Education Fund, excluding the
5 Education Stabilization Account, decreases from the preceding fiscal year. If the
6 amount of money contained in the State Education Fund, excluding the Education
7 Stabilization Account, decreases from the preceding fiscal year, it is the intent of
8 the Legislature that a proportional reduction be made in both the statewide base per
9 pupil funding amount and the weighted funding appropriated pursuant to paragraph
10 (e) of subsection 2.
11 2. After a direct legislative appropriation is made to the State Education Fund
12 from the State General Fund pursuant to NRS 387.1212, the money in the State
13 Education Fund, excluding any amount of money in the Education Stabilization
14 Account [,] or money appropriated or transferred pursuant to section 2 of this act,
15 must be appropriated as established by law for each fiscal year of the biennium for
16 the following purposes:
17 (a) To each school district, an amount of money determined to be sufficient by
18 the Legislature, when combined with any other resources available for this purpose,
19 to provide food services and transportation for pupils and any other similar service
20 that the Legislature deems appropriate.
21 (b) To each school district, charter school or university school for profoundly
22 gifted pupils, an amount of money determined to be sufficient by the Legislature,
23 when combined with any other resources available for this purpose, to provide local
24 funding to support pupils with disabilities.
25 (c) To each school district, an amount of money determined to be sufficient by
26 the Legislature, when combined with any other resources available for this purpose,
27 to provide adjusted base per pupil funding for each pupil estimated to be enrolled in
28 the school district.
29 (d) To each charter school or university school for profoundly gifted pupils, an
30 amount of money determined to be sufficient by the Legislature, when combined
31 with any other resources available for this purpose, to provide:
32 (1) The statewide base per pupil funding amount for each pupil estimated
33 to be enrolled full-time in a program of distance education provided by the charter
34 school or university school for profoundly gifted pupils; and
35 (2) Adjusted base per pupil funding for each pupil estimated to be enrolled
36 in the charter school or university school for profoundly gifted pupils other than a
37 pupil identified in subparagraph (1).
38 (e) To each school district, charter school or university school for profoundly
39 gifted pupils, an amount of money determined to be sufficient by the Legislature,
40 when combined with any other resources available for this purpose, to provide
41 additional weighted funding for each pupil estimated to be enrolled in the school
42 district, charter school or university school for profoundly gifted pupils who is:
43 (1) An English learner;
44 (2) An at-risk pupil; or
45 (3) A gifted and talented pupil.
46 3. The adjusted base per pupil funding appropriated pursuant to paragraph (c)
47 of subsection 2 for each school district must be determined by applying the cost
48 adjustment factor established pursuant to NRS 387.1215 which applies to the
49 school district and the attendance area adjustment established pursuant to NRS
50 387.1218 which applies to each applicable area of the school district to the
51 statewide base per pupil funding amount.
52 4. The adjusted base per pupil funding appropriated pursuant to subparagraph
53 (2) of paragraph (d) of subsection 2 for each charter school or university school for
Assembly Amendment No. 805 to Assembly Bill No. 398 Page 11
1 profoundly gifted pupils must be determined by applying the cost adjustment factor
2 established pursuant to NRS 387.1215 which applies to the charter school or
3 university school and, if applicable, the attendance area adjustment established
4 pursuant to NRS 387.1218 to the statewide base per pupil funding amount.
5 5. The weighted funding appropriated pursuant to paragraph (e) of subsection
6 2 must be established separately for each category of pupils identified in that
7 paragraph and expressed as a multiplier to be applied to the statewide base per pupil
8 funding amount determined pursuant to subsection 1. A pupil who belongs to more
9 than one category of pupils or for whom a school district, charter school or
10 university school for profoundly gifted pupils is eligible to receive the statewide
11 multiplier pursuant to NRS 387.122 must receive only the weighted funding for the
12 single category to which the pupil belongs which has the largest multiplier or the
13 statewide multiplier, whichever is larger. It is the intent of the Legislature that, to
14 the extent practicable:
15 (a) The multiplier for each category of pupils for any fiscal year be not less
16 than the multiplier for the immediately preceding fiscal year unless:
17 (1) The amount of money contained in the State Education Fund, excluding
18 the Education Stabilization Account, decreases from the preceding fiscal year, in
19 which event it is the intent of the Legislature that a proportional reduction be made
20 in both the statewide base per pupil funding amount and the weighted funding
21 appropriated pursuant to paragraph (e) of subsection 2; or
22 (2) The amount of money contained in the State Education Fund, excluding
23 the Education Stabilization Account, increases from the preceding fiscal year but in
24 an amount which, after funding the appropriations required by paragraphs (a) to (d),
25 inclusive, of subsection 2, is insufficient to fund the multiplier for each category of
26 pupils, in which event it is the intent of the Legislature that the remaining money in
27 the State Education Fund be used to provide a multiplier for each category of pupils
28 which is as close as practicable to the multiplier for the preceding fiscal year;
29 (b) The recommendations of the Commission for the multiplier for each
30 category of pupils be considered and the multiplier for one category of pupils may
31 be changed by an amount that is not proportional to the change in the multiplier for
32 one or more other categories of pupils if the Legislature determines that a
33 disproportionate need to serve the pupils in the affected category exists; and
34 (c) If the multipliers for all categories of pupils in a fiscal year are increased
35 from the multipliers in the immediately preceding fiscal year, a proportional
36 increase is considered for the statewide base per pupil funding amount.
37 6. For any money identified in subsection 4 of NRS 362.170 which is
38 deposited to the credit of the State Education Fund:
39 (a) The amount of such money for the county from which the money was
40 collected that does not exceed the total amount of money appropriated pursuant to
41 subsection 2 to the county school district is deemed to be the first money
42 appropriated pursuant to subsection 2 for that county school district and the first
43 money spent by that county school district from the county school district fund
44 during the applicable fiscal year.
45 (b) The amount of such money for the county from which the money was
46 collected which exceeds the total amount of money appropriated pursuant to
47 subsection 2 to the county school district must be transferred to the county school
48 district and is hereby authorized for expenditure as a continuing appropriation for
49 the purpose of mitigating the adverse effects of the cyclical nature of the industry of
50 extracting and processing minerals on the ability of the county school district to
51 offer its pupils a reasonably equal educational opportunity.
52 7. The weighted funding appropriated pursuant to paragraph (e) of subsection
53 2:
Assembly Amendment No. 805 to Assembly Bill No. 398 Page 12
1 (a) May not be used to settle or arbitrate disputes between a recognized
2 organization representing employees of a school district or the governing body of a
3 charter school and the school district or governing body or to settle any
4 negotiations; and
5 (b) May not be used to adjust the district-wide schedules of salaries and
6 benefits of the employees of a school district.

16 less any amount set aside as a reserve , appropriated or transferred pursuant to
17 section 2 of this act or contained in the Education Stabilization Account. Except as
18 otherwise provided in NRS 387.1244, the apportionment to a school district,
19 computed on a yearly basis, equals the amounts established by law for each school
20 year pursuant to paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (e) of subsection 2 of NRS 387.1214

40 district must be directly related to the district’s reimbursements for the Program as
41 compared with the total amount of reimbursements for all school districts in this
42 State that participate in the Program.] (Deleted by amendment.)
43 Sec. 8. NRS 387.12445 is hereby amended to read as follows:

48 district in an amount which does not exceed the amount prescribed by the
49 Department by regulation for each school district, be distributed and used as
50 described in this subsection. The adjusted base per pupil funding provided to each
51 school district must:
Assembly Amendment No. 805 to Assembly Bill No. 398 Page 13
1 (a) Be distributed by each school district to its public schools in a manner that
2 ensures each pupil in the school district receives a reasonably equal educational

8 purpose for which specific funding is not appropriated pursuant to paragraph (a),
9 (b) or (e) of subsection 2 of NRS 387.1214 or NRS 387.122.
10 2. If a school district determines that an additional amount of money is
11 necessary to satisfy requirements for maintenance of effort or any other
12 requirement under federal law for pupils with disabilities enrolled in the school
13 district, the school district may transfer the necessary amount of money from the
14 adjusted base per pupil funding received by the school district for that purpose.
15 3. Each school district shall ensure that all weighted funding received by the
16 school district pursuant to paragraph (e) of subsection 2 of NRS 387.1214 is
17 accounted for separately and distributed directly to each school in which the

19 4. Each public school shall account separately for the local funding for pupils
20 with disabilities received by the public school pursuant to paragraph (b) of
21 subsection 2 of NRS 387.1214, for the adjusted base per pupil funding received by
22 the public school pursuant to paragraph (c) of subsection 2 of NRS 387.1214, for
23 each category of weighted funding received by the public school pursuant to
24 paragraph (e) of subsection 2 of NRS 387.1214 and for money received from the
25 statewide multiplier pursuant to NRS 387.122. Unless the provisions of subsection
26 7 or 8 impose greater restrictions on the use of weighted funding by a public school,
27 the public school must use the weighted funding received for each relevant pupil:
28 (a) As a supplement to the adjusted base per pupil funding received for the
29 pupil; and

50 pupils must use that weighted funding only to provide Victory services and, if one
51 or more at-risk pupils for whom the school received weighted funding in the at-risk
52 pupil category also belong to one or more other categories of pupils who receive

7 of pupils who receive weighted funding, the additional services for each such
8 English learner which are appropriate for each category to which the English
9 learner belongs.
10 9. The Department shall adopt regulations prescribing the maximum amount
11 of money that each school district may deduct for its administrative expenses from
12 the adjusted base per pupil funding received by the school district. When adopting
13 such regulations, the Department may express the maximum amount of money that

9 387.12455 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 5, for the purpose
10 of establishing budgetary estimates for expenditures and revenues for the State
11 Education Fund as prescribed by the State Budget Act, the Governor shall, to the
12 extent practicable, ensure that an amount of money in the State General Fund is
13 reserved in the proposed executive budget for transfer to the State Education Fund
14 which is sufficient to fully fund:
15 (a) If the Economic Forum projects that the revenue collected by the State for
16 general, unrestricted uses will increase by a rate that is greater than the combined
17 rate of inflation and the growth of enrollment in the public schools in this State in
18 the immediately preceding biennium, an amount of money in the State General
19 Fund for transfer to the State Education Fund for the subsequent biennium which is
20 not less than the amount of money transferred to the State Education Fund from the
21 State General Fund for the immediately preceding biennium increased by an
22 amount not less than the rate of increase for the revenue collected by the State as
23 projected by the Economic Forum.
24 (b) If the Economic Forum projects that the revenue collected by the State for
25 general, unrestricted uses will increase by a rate that is not greater than the
26 combined rate of inflation and the growth of enrollment in the public schools in this
27 State in the immediately preceding biennium, an amount of money in the State
28 General Fund for transfer to the State Education Fund for the subsequent biennium
29 which is not less than the amount of money transferred to the State Education Fund
30 from the State General Fund for the immediately preceding biennium increased by
31 an amount not less than the combined rate of inflation and the growth of enrollment
32 in the public schools in this State.
33 (c) If the Economic Forum projects that the revenue collected by the State for
34 general, unrestricted uses will decrease, an amount of money in the State General
35 Fund for transfer to the State Education Fund for the subsequent biennium which is
36 not less than the amount of money transferred to the State Education Fund from the
37 State General Fund for the immediately preceding biennium decreased by an
38 amount not greater than the rate of decrease for the revenue collected by the State
39 as projected by the Economic Forum.
40 2. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 5, as part of the proposed
41 executive budget, the Governor shall, to the extent practicable, include
42 recommendations for:
43 (a) The statewide base per pupil funding amount, which must be equal to the
44 statewide base per pupil funding amount for the immediately preceding biennium
45 increased by an amount not less than the combined rate of inflation and the growth
46 of enrollment in the public schools in this State unless the amount of money
47 contained in the State Education Fund, excluding the Education Stabilization
48 Account, decreases from the immediately preceding biennium, in which event the
49 Governor must recommend a proportional reduction to both the statewide base per
50 pupil funding amount and the multiplier for each category of pupils pursuant to
51 paragraph (b); [and]
52 (b) The multiplier for each category of pupils, which must not be less than the
53 multiplier for the immediately preceding biennium unless:
Assembly Amendment No. 805 to Assembly Bill No. 398 Page 16
1 (1) The amount of money contained in the State Education Fund, excluding
2 the Education Stabilization Account, decreases from the immediately preceding
3 biennium, in which event the Governor must recommend a proportional reduction
4 to both the statewide base per pupil funding amount pursuant to paragraph (a) and
5 the multiplier for each category of pupils; or
6 (2) The amount of money contained in the State Education Fund, excluding
7 the Education Stabilization Account, increases from the preceding fiscal year but in
8 an amount which, after recommending the statewide base per pupil funding amount
9 pursuant to paragraph (a), is insufficient to fund the multiplier for each category of
10 pupils, in which event the Governor must recommend the remaining money in the
11 State Education Fund, excluding the Education Stabilization Account, be used to
12 provide a multiplier for each category of pupils which is as close as practicable to
13 the multiplier for the preceding fiscal year [.] ; and
14 (c) The amount of money to appropriate to the Department to make awards
15 to school districts pursuant to section 2 of this act.
16 3. When determining the amount of money to reserve for transfer from the

18 Governor shall consider the recommendations of the Commission, as revised by the
19 Joint Interim Standing Committee on Education, if applicable, for an optimal level
20 of funding for education and may reserve an additional amount of money for
21 transfer to the State Education Fund that the Governor determines to be sufficient to
22 fund any recommendation or any portion of a recommendation that the Governor
23 includes in the proposed executive budget.
24 4. As part of the proposed executive budget, the Governor may recommend to
25 the Legislature a revision to any appropriation made by law pursuant to NRS
26 387.1214, including, without limitation, the statewide base per pupil funding
27 amount, the adjusted base per pupil funding for any school district, the multiplier
28 for weighted funding for any category of pupils or the creation or elimination of a
29 category of pupils to receive additional weighted funding. The Governor may
30 recommend additional funding for any recommendation made pursuant to this
31 subsection.
32 5. If the Governor determines that it would be impracticable to prepare the
33 proposed executive budget as described in subsection 1 or 2, the Governor may
34 instead include in the proposed executive budget a recommendation for such
35 funding for the public schools in this State as he or she determines to be
36 appropriate. If the Governor includes in the proposed executive budget
37 recommendations pursuant to this subsection, the recommendations must be
38 accompanied by such recommendations for legislation as the Governor determines
39 to be appropriate to improve the method by which funding for the public schools in
40 this State is determined.
41 6. As used in this section, “rate of inflation” means the average percentage of
42 increase or decrease in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, West
43 Region (All Items), as published by the United States Department of Labor for the
44 immediately preceding 3 calendar years or, if that index ceases to be published by
45 the United States Department of Labor, the published index that most closely
46 resembles that index, as determined by the Governor.

AN ACT relating to education; [requiring additional support for the State Education
Fund] requiring the Department of Education to award money to
school districts to provide compensation in addition to base pay for
hard-to-fill positions in public schools; requiring [the Superintendent
of Public Instruction to apportion the amount allocated to provide such
compensation among] school districts [on a monthly basis;] to report

authority in certain large school districts to use weighted funding
provided to a school for certain pupils to pay certain hiring and

making an appropriation to the Interim Finance Committee for
allocation to the Department to fund compensation in addition to
base pay for hard-to-fill positions in public schools; making an
appropriation to provide money to charter schools for salary
increases for teachers and education support professionals; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 [Existing law creates the State Education Fund for the support of the operation of the
2 public schools in this State and requires that certain revenues of the State be deposited in the
3 Fund. In addition to these revenues, existing law requires support for the State Education Fund
4 to be provided by direct legislative appropriation in an amount determined by the Legislature
5 to be sufficient to fund the operation of public schools in this State for the next ensuing
6 biennium. (NRS 387.1212) After this direct legislative appropriation is made, existing law
7 directs the Legislature to determine the statewide base per pupil funding amount for each
8 fiscal year of the biennium, which is the amount of money on a per pupil basis for the
9 projected enrollment of the public schools in this State which the Legislature determines is
10 sufficient to fund the cost of all public schools in this State to operate and provide general
11 education to all pupils, with the exception of certain expenses for which specific funding is

Assembly Amendment No. 805 to Assembly Bill No. 398 Page 4
12 otherwise provided. (NRS 387.1214)] Section 2 of this bill [requires that additional support
13 for the State Education Fund be provided in an amount determined by the Legislature to be
14 sufficient to ameliorate high teacher vacancy rates by providing] requires the Department of
15 Education, to the extent that money has been appropriated for that purpose, to make
16 awards to school districts to provide compensation, in addition to base pay, for hard-to-fill
17 positions in the public schools of this State. [Sections 2 and 6 of this bill exclude this amount
18 from the calculation of the base per pupil funding amount.] Section 2 defines “hard-to-fill
19 position” as including: (1) teacher positions at certain Title I schools; and (2) teacher positions
20 and other positions filled by licensed educational personnel whose duties include actively
21 teaching pupils in certain subjects which are suffering from a critical labor shortage. [Sections
22 2 and 5 of this bill authorize the money for this amount to be appropriated to the State
23 Education Fund from the State General Fund or transferred, at the direction of the Legislature,
24 from the Education Stabilization Account.
25 Section 3 of this bill requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction to apportion the
26 money appropriated or transferred to the State Education Fund pursuant to section 2 among
27 the school districts in this State, on a monthly basis, according to the yearly apportionment for
28 each school district as specified by the Legislature. Section 3 provides for the reversion of any
29 such money which is not committed for expenditure at the end of each fiscal year.
30 Sections 4, 6 and 7 of this bill exclude certain amounts appropriated or transferred to the
31 State Education Fund pursuant to section 2 from: (1) the money upon which interest is earned
32 for the State Education Fund; and (2) money in the State Education Fund which must be used
33 for certain purposes.] Section 2 requires each school district to submit a biennial report to
34 the Office of Finance in the Office of the Governor and the Interim Finance Committee
35 regarding the number of teachers receiving such additional compensation, the total
36 amount of such additional compensation being provided in the school district and the
37 number of hard-to-fill positions in public schools in the school district. Section 8.9 of this
38 bill imposes certain requirements for the contents of this report which are applicable
39 only to the report that is required to be submitted on or before December 1, 2026.
40 Existing law requires the Governor, to the extent practicable, to include in the
41 proposed executive budget certain recommendations concerning education funding,
42 including recommendations for the statewide base per pupil funding amount and the
43 multiplier for each category of pupils. (NRS 387.12455) Section 8.1 of this bill
44 additionally requires the Governor, to the extent practicable, to include in the proposed
45 executive budget recommendations for the amount of money to appropriate to the
46 Department to make awards to school districts pursuant to section 2.
47 Section 8.5 of this bill appropriates $45,000,000 in both Fiscal Year 2025-2026
48 and Fiscal Year 2026-2027 to the Interim Finance Committee for allocation to the
49 Department to distribute to school districts to provide compensation, in addition to base
50 pay, for hard-to-fill positions in public schools. Section 8.5 establishes certain
51 requirements which must be satisfied before the money is allocated by the Interim
52 Finance Committee.
53 Under the Pupil-Centered Funding Plan, existing law requires a public school that
54 receives weighted funding for one or more at-risk pupils or pupils who are English learners to
55 use such funding only to provide services to such pupils, which are referred to as “Victory
56 services” and “Zoom services,” respectively. (NRS 387.121, 387.12445) Existing law
57 authorizes the use of this weighted funding to provide incentives for hiring and retaining
58 teachers and other licensed educational personnel who provide such services. (NRS
59 387.12445) Section 8 of this bill eliminates the authority to use weighted funding to pay for
60 such incentives [.] in a school district located in a county whose population is 700,000 or
61 more (currently the Clark County School District).
62 Existing law creates the Subcommittee on Educational Accountability of the Interim
63 Finance Committee and authorizes the Subcommittee to study various matters related to
64 accountability in public education. (NRS 218E.415) Section 8.3 of this bill additionally
65 authorizes the Subcommittee to study the compensation paid to teachers at public
66 schools to determine whether such compensation is sufficient to ensure competitiveness
67 with other states and optimal educational achievements and outcomes for pupils.
68 Section 8.7 of this bill appropriates $19,314,297 in both Fiscal Year 2025-2026 and
69 Fiscal Year 2026-2027 to the Interim Finance Committee for allocation to the State
70 Public Charter School Authority to provide money to charter schools for salary

Assembly Amendment No. 805 to Assembly Bill No. 398 Page 5
71 increases for teachers and education support professionals. Section 8.7 requires each
72 charter school in this State to submit certain information to the State Public Charter
73 School Authority, including the number of teachers and education support professionals
74 employed by the charter school on October 1, 2024, and October 1, 2025, and a plan to
75 provide such salary increases in each fiscal year. Section 8.7 requires the State Public
76 Charter School Authority to compile and submit such information to the Interim
77 Finance Committee as a condition for receiving an allocation by the Interim Finance
78 Committee from the appropriation made by section 8.7. Section 8.7 provides the method
79 for calculating the amount of money from the appropriation which the State Public
80 Charter School Authority may distribute to each charter school.

15 ameliorate the urgent problem of high teacher vacancy rates, which are
16 detrimental to student outcomes. [To the extent that the reporting on hard-to-fill
17 positions pursuant to subsection 4 demonstrates that such positions no longer
18 exist at a school district, the Legislature may determine that such funding should
19 not be provided to the school district during a given biennium. It is the intent of
20 the Legislature, when making the appropriation or transfer pursuant to
21 subsection 1, to specify the apportionment for each school district for each fiscal
22 year of the biennium.]

Assembly Amendment No. 805 to Assembly Bill No. 398 Page 6
1 4. It is the intent of the Legislature that money appropriated or transferred

40 among the several county school districts in amounts approximating one-twelfth

25 Sec. 5. [NRS 387.1213 is hereby amended to read as follows:
26 387.1213 1. The Education Stabilization Account is hereby created in the
27 State Education Fund. Except as otherwise provided in this section, each year after
28 the close of the previous fiscal year and before the issuance of the State Controller’s
29 annual report, each county school district shall transfer from the county school
30 district fund to the Education Stabilization Account any amount by which the actual
31 ending fund balance of the county school district fund exceeds 16.6 percent of the
32 total actual expenditures for the fund. The interest and income earned on the money
33 in the Account, after deducting any applicable charges, must be credited to the
34 Account.
35 2. Money transferred pursuant to subsection 1 to the Education Stabilization
36 Account is a continuing appropriation solely for the purpose of authorizing the
37 expenditure of the transferred money for the purposes set forth in this section [.]
38 and section 2 of this act.
39 3. The balance in the Education Stabilization Account must not exceed 20
40 percent of the total of all appropriations and authorizations from the State
41 Education Fund, excluding the Education Stabilization Account, for the
42 immediately preceding fiscal year. Any money transferred to the Education
43 Stabilization Account which exceeds this amount must instead be transferred to the
44 State Education Fund.
45 4. If the Interim Finance Committee finds that:
46 (a) Upon submission of a request from the Department, the actual enrollment
47 growth for a fiscal year exceeds the projected enrollment growth by an amount that
48 the Interim Finance Committee determines would make a transfer of money to the
49 State Education Fund necessary to fund the excess enrollment;
50 (b) The collection of revenue in any fiscal year will result in the State
51 Education Fund receiving less money than authorized for expenditure from the
52 State Education Fund;

Assembly Amendment No. 805 to Assembly Bill No. 398 Page 9
1 (c) Upon submission of a request from the Department, any amount of money
2 which was deposited in the State Education Fund is found by an audit to have been
3 deposited in error; or
4 (d) Upon submission of a request from the Department, any error in the
5 application of the Pupil-Centered Funding Plan by the Department has created a
6 shortfall in the State Education Fund,
7  the Committee shall by resolution establish an amount of money to transfer from
8 the Education Stabilization Account to the State Education Fund and direct the
9 State Controller to transfer that amount to the State Education Fund. The State
10 Controller shall thereupon make the transfer.
11 5. When determining the actual ending fund balance for the purposes of
12 subsection 1, each county school district shall exclude:
13 (a) Any money deposited in the county school district fund on or before June
14 30, 2020;

22 from the State Education Fund to a county school district, charter school or
23 university school for profoundly gifted pupils pursuant to NRS 387.185 exceeds the
24 amount of money available in the State Education Fund because of a delay in
25 expected receipts, he or she may request from the Director of the Office of Finance
26 a temporary advance from the Education Stabilization Account for the payment of
27 such money due. Upon receipt of such a request, the Director of the Office of
28 Finance shall make a recommendation to the Interim Finance Committee to
29 approve the temporary advance in whole or in part or to deny the request. If the
30 Interim Finance Committee approves the request in whole or in part, the Director of
31 the Office of Finance shall notify the State Controller and the Fiscal Analysis
32 Division of the Legislative Counsel Bureau of the amount approved by the Interim
33 Finance Committee, and the State Controller shall draw his or her warrant upon

37 advance is made.
38 7. The balance remaining in the State Education Fund, excluding the balance
39 remaining in the Education Stabilization Account, that has not been committed for
40 expenditure on or before June 30 of an odd-numbered fiscal year must be
41 transferred to the Education Stabilization Account to the extent that such a transfer
42 would not cause the balance in the Education Stabilization Account to exceed the
43 limit established in subsection 3.] (Deleted by amendment.)
44 Sec. 6. [NRS 387.1214 is hereby amended to read as follows:
45 387.1214 1. After a direct legislative appropriation is made to the State
46 Education Fund from the State General Fund pursuant to NRS 387.1212, the
47 Legislature shall determine the statewide base per pupil funding amount for each
48 fiscal year of the biennium, which is the amount of money expressed on a per pupil
49 basis for the projected enrollment of the public schools in this State, determined to
50 be sufficient by the Legislature to fund the costs of all public schools in this State to
51 operate and provide general education to all pupils for any purpose for which
52 specific funding is not appropriated pursuant to paragraph (a), (b) or (e) of
53 subsection 2 or NRS 387.122 [.] or section 2 of this act. It is the intent of the

Assembly Amendment No. 805 to Assembly Bill No. 398 Page 10
1 Legislature that the statewide base per pupil funding amount for any fiscal year, to
2 the extent practicable, be not less than the statewide base per pupil funding amount
3 for the immediately preceding fiscal year, adjusted by the rate of inflation, unless
4 the amount of money contained in the State Education Fund, excluding the
5 Education Stabilization Account, decreases from the preceding fiscal year. If the
6 amount of money contained in the State Education Fund, excluding the Education
7 Stabilization Account, decreases from the preceding fiscal year, it is the intent of
8 the Legislature that a proportional reduction be made in both the statewide base per
9 pupil funding amount and the weighted funding appropriated pursuant to paragraph
10 (e) of subsection 2.
11 2. After a direct legislative appropriation is made to the State Education Fund
12 from the State General Fund pursuant to NRS 387.1212, the money in the State
13 Education Fund, excluding any amount of money in the Education Stabilization
14 Account [,] or money appropriated or transferred pursuant to section 2 of this act,
15 must be appropriated as established by law for each fiscal year of the biennium for
16 the following purposes:
17 (a) To each school district, an amount of money determined to be sufficient by
18 the Legislature, when combined with any other resources available for this purpose,
19 to provide food services and transportation for pupils and any other similar service
20 that the Legislature deems appropriate.
21 (b) To each school district, charter school or university school for profoundly
22 gifted pupils, an amount of money determined to be sufficient by the Legislature,
23 when combined with any other resources available for this purpose, to provide local
24 funding to support pupils with disabilities.
25 (c) To each school district, an amount of money determined to be sufficient by
26 the Legislature, when combined with any other resources available for this purpose,
27 to provide adjusted base per pupil funding for each pupil estimated to be enrolled in
28 the school district.
29 (d) To each charter school or university school for profoundly gifted pupils, an
30 amount of money determined to be sufficient by the Legislature, when combined
31 with any other resources available for this purpose, to provide:
32 (1) The statewide base per pupil funding amount for each pupil estimated
33 to be enrolled full-time in a program of distance education provided by the charter
34 school or university school for profoundly gifted pupils; and
35 (2) Adjusted base per pupil funding for each pupil estimated to be enrolled
36 in the charter school or university school for profoundly gifted pupils other than a
37 pupil identified in subparagraph (1).
38 (e) To each school district, charter school or university school for profoundly
39 gifted pupils, an amount of money determined to be sufficient by the Legislature,
40 when combined with any other resources available for this purpose, to provide
41 additional weighted funding for each pupil estimated to be enrolled in the school
42 district, charter school or university school for profoundly gifted pupils who is:
43 (1) An English learner;
44 (2) An at-risk pupil; or
45 (3) A gifted and talented pupil.
46 3. The adjusted base per pupil funding appropriated pursuant to paragraph (c)
47 of subsection 2 for each school district must be determined by applying the cost
48 adjustment factor established pursuant to NRS 387.1215 which applies to the
49 school district and the attendance area adjustment established pursuant to NRS
50 387.1218 which applies to each applicable area of the school district to the
51 statewide base per pupil funding amount.
52 4. The adjusted base per pupil funding appropriated pursuant to subparagraph
53 (2) of paragraph (d) of subsection 2 for each charter school or university school for

Assembly Amendment No. 805 to Assembly Bill No. 398 Page 11
1 profoundly gifted pupils must be determined by applying the cost adjustment factor
2 established pursuant to NRS 387.1215 which applies to the charter school or
3 university school and, if applicable, the attendance area adjustment established
4 pursuant to NRS 387.1218 to the statewide base per pupil funding amount.
5 5. The weighted funding appropriated pursuant to paragraph (e) of subsection
6 2 must be established separately for each category of pupils identified in that
7 paragraph and expressed as a multiplier to be applied to the statewide base per pupil
8 funding amount determined pursuant to subsection 1. A pupil who belongs to more
9 than one category of pupils or for whom a school district, charter school or
10 university school for profoundly gifted pupils is eligible to receive the statewide
11 multiplier pursuant to NRS 387.122 must receive only the weighted funding for the
12 single category to which the pupil belongs which has the largest multiplier or the
13 statewide multiplier, whichever is larger. It is the intent of the Legislature that, to
14 the extent practicable:
15 (a) The multiplier for each category of pupils for any fiscal year be not less
16 than the multiplier for the immediately preceding fiscal year unless:
17 (1) The amount of money contained in the State Education Fund, excluding
18 the Education Stabilization Account, decreases from the preceding fiscal year, in
19 which event it is the intent of the Legislature that a proportional reduction be made
20 in both the statewide base per pupil funding amount and the weighted funding
21 appropriated pursuant to paragraph (e) of subsection 2; or
22 (2) The amount of money contained in the State Education Fund, excluding
23 the Education Stabilization Account, increases from the preceding fiscal year but in
24 an amount which, after funding the appropriations required by paragraphs (a) to (d),
25 inclusive, of subsection 2, is insufficient to fund the multiplier for each category of
26 pupils, in which event it is the intent of the Legislature that the remaining money in
27 the State Education Fund be used to provide a multiplier for each category of pupils
28 which is as close as practicable to the multiplier for the preceding fiscal year;
29 (b) The recommendations of the Commission for the multiplier for each
30 category of pupils be considered and the multiplier for one category of pupils may
31 be changed by an amount that is not proportional to the change in the multiplier for
32 one or more other categories of pupils if the Legislature determines that a
33 disproportionate need to serve the pupils in the affected category exists; and
34 (c) If the multipliers for all categories of pupils in a fiscal year are increased
35 from the multipliers in the immediately preceding fiscal year, a proportional
36 increase is considered for the statewide base per pupil funding amount.
37 6. For any money identified in subsection 4 of NRS 362.170 which is
38 deposited to the credit of the State Education Fund:
39 (a) The amount of such money for the county from which the money was
40 collected that does not exceed the total amount of money appropriated pursuant to
41 subsection 2 to the county school district is deemed to be the first money
42 appropriated pursuant to subsection 2 for that county school district and the first
43 money spent by that county school district from the county school district fund
44 during the applicable fiscal year.
45 (b) The amount of such money for the county from which the money was
46 collected which exceeds the total amount of money appropriated pursuant to
47 subsection 2 to the county school district must be transferred to the county school
48 district and is hereby authorized for expenditure as a continuing appropriation for
49 the purpose of mitigating the adverse effects of the cyclical nature of the industry of
50 extracting and processing minerals on the ability of the county school district to
51 offer its pupils a reasonably equal educational opportunity.
52 7. The weighted funding appropriated pursuant to paragraph (e) of subsection
53 2:

Assembly Amendment No. 805 to Assembly Bill No. 398 Page 12
1 (a) May not be used to settle or arbitrate disputes between a recognized
2 organization representing employees of a school district or the governing body of a
3 charter school and the school district or governing body or to settle any
4 negotiations; and
5 (b) May not be used to adjust the district-wide schedules of salaries and
6 benefits of the employees of a school district.

9 387.12455 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 5, for the purpose
10 of establishing budgetary estimates for expenditures and revenues for the State
11 Education Fund as prescribed by the State Budget Act, the Governor shall, to the
12 extent practicable, ensure that an amount of money in the State General Fund is
13 reserved in the proposed executive budget for transfer to the State Education Fund
14 which is sufficient to fully fund:
15 (a) If the Economic Forum projects that the revenue collected by the State for
16 general, unrestricted uses will increase by a rate that is greater than the combined
17 rate of inflation and the growth of enrollment in the public schools in this State in
18 the immediately preceding biennium, an amount of money in the State General
19 Fund for transfer to the State Education Fund for the subsequent biennium which is
20 not less than the amount of money transferred to the State Education Fund from the
21 State General Fund for the immediately preceding biennium increased by an
22 amount not less than the rate of increase for the revenue collected by the State as
23 projected by the Economic Forum.
24 (b) If the Economic Forum projects that the revenue collected by the State for
25 general, unrestricted uses will increase by a rate that is not greater than the
26 combined rate of inflation and the growth of enrollment in the public schools in this
27 State in the immediately preceding biennium, an amount of money in the State
28 General Fund for transfer to the State Education Fund for the subsequent biennium
29 which is not less than the amount of money transferred to the State Education Fund
30 from the State General Fund for the immediately preceding biennium increased by
31 an amount not less than the combined rate of inflation and the growth of enrollment
32 in the public schools in this State.
33 (c) If the Economic Forum projects that the revenue collected by the State for
34 general, unrestricted uses will decrease, an amount of money in the State General
35 Fund for transfer to the State Education Fund for the subsequent biennium which is
36 not less than the amount of money transferred to the State Education Fund from the
37 State General Fund for the immediately preceding biennium decreased by an
38 amount not greater than the rate of decrease for the revenue collected by the State
39 as projected by the Economic Forum.
40 2. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 5, as part of the proposed
41 executive budget, the Governor shall, to the extent practicable, include
42 recommendations for:

46 of enrollment in the public schools in this State unless the amount of money
47 contained in the State Education Fund, excluding the Education Stabilization
48 Account, decreases from the immediately preceding biennium, in which event the
49 Governor must recommend a proportional reduction to both the statewide base per
50 pupil funding amount and the multiplier for each category of pupils pursuant to
51 paragraph (b); [and]
52 (b) The multiplier for each category of pupils, which must not be less than the
53 multiplier for the immediately preceding biennium unless:

Assembly Amendment No. 805 to Assembly Bill No. 398 Page 16

2 the Education Stabilization Account, decreases from the immediately preceding
3 biennium, in which event the Governor must recommend a proportional reduction

5 the multiplier for each category of pupils; or
6 (2) The amount of money contained in the State Education Fund, excluding
7 the Education Stabilization Account, increases from the preceding fiscal year but in
8 an amount which, after recommending the statewide base per pupil funding amount
9 pursuant to paragraph (a), is insufficient to fund the multiplier for each category of
10 pupils, in which event the Governor must recommend the remaining money in the
11 State Education Fund, excluding the Education Stabilization Account, be used to
12 provide a multiplier for each category of pupils which is as close as practicable to
13 the multiplier for the preceding fiscal year [.] ; and
14 (c) The amount of money to appropriate to the Department to make awards
15 to school districts pursuant to section 2 of this act.

25 the Legislature a revision to any appropriation made by law pursuant to NRS

36 appropriate. If the Governor includes in the proposed executive budget
37 recommendations pursuant to this subsection, the recommendations must be

39 to be appropriate to improve the method by which funding for the public schools in
40 this State is determined.
