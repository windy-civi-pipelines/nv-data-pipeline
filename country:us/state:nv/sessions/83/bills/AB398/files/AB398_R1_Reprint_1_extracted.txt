EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; requiring the Department of
Education to award money to school districts to provide
compensation in addition to base pay for hard-to-fill
positions in public schools; requiring school districts to
report certain information relating to hard-to-fill
positions; eliminating the authority in certain large school
districts to use weighted funding provided to a school for
certain pupils to pay certain hiring and retention
incentives; revising the powers of the Subcommittee on
Education Accountability of the Interim Finance
Committee; making an appropriation to the Interim
Finance Committee for allocation to the Department to
fund compensation in addition to base pay for hard-to-fill
positions in public schools; making an appropriation to
provide money to charter schools for salary increases for
teachers and education support professionals; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Section 2 of this bill requires the Department of Education, to the extent that
2 money has been appropriated for that purpose, to make awards to school districts to
3 provide compensation, in addition to base pay, for hard-to-fill positions in the
4 public schools of this State. Section 2 defines “hard-to-fill position” as including:
5 (1) teacher positions at certain Title I schools; and (2) teacher positions and other
6 positions filled by licensed educational personnel whose duties include actively
7 teaching pupils in certain subjects which are suffering from a critical labor
8 shortage. Section 2 requires each school district to submit a biennial report to the
-
*AB398_R1*
– 2 –
9 Office of Finance in the Office of the Governor and the Interim Finance Committee
10 regarding the number of teachers receiving such additional compensation, the total
11 amount of such additional compensation being provided in the school district and
12 the number of hard-to-fill positions in public schools in the school district. Section
13 8.9 of this bill imposes certain requirements for the contents of this report which are
14 applicable only to the report that is required to be submitted on or before
15 December 1, 2026.
16 Existing law requires the Governor, to the extent practicable, to include in the
17 proposed executive budget certain recommendations concerning education funding,
18 including recommendations for the statewide base per pupil funding amount and
19 the multiplier for each category of pupils. (NRS 387.12455) Section 8.1 of this bill
20 additionally requires the Governor, to the extent practicable, to include in the
21 proposed executive budget recommendations for the amount of money to
22 appropriate to the Department to make awards to school districts pursuant to
23 section 2.
24 Section 8.5 of this bill appropriates $45,000,000 in both Fiscal Year 2025-
25 2026 and Fiscal Year 2026-2027 to the Interim Finance Committee for allocation to
26 the Department to distribute to school districts to provide compensation, in addition
27 to base pay, for hard-to-fill positions in public schools. Section 8.5 establishes
28 certain requirements which must be satisfied before the money is allocated by the
29 Interim Finance Committee.
30 Under the Pupil-Centered Funding Plan, existing law requires a public school
31 that receives weighted funding for one or more at-risk pupils or pupils who are
32 English learners to use such funding only to provide services to such pupils, which
33 are referred to as “Victory services” and “Zoom services,” respectively. (NRS
34 387.121, 387.12445) Existing law authorizes the use of this weighted funding to
35 provide incentives for hiring and retaining teachers and other licensed educational
36 personnel who provide such services. (NRS 387.12445) Section 8 of this bill
37 eliminates the authority to use weighted funding to pay for such incentives in a
38 school district located in a county whose population is 700,000 or more (currently
39 the Clark County School District).
40 Existing law creates the Subcommittee on Educational Accountability of the
41 Interim Finance Committee and authorizes the Subcommittee to study various
42 matters related to accountability in public education. (NRS 218E.415) Section 8.3
43 of this bill additionally authorizes the Subcommittee to study the compensation
44 paid to teachers at public schools to determine whether such compensation is
45 sufficient to ensure competitiveness with other states and optimal educational
46 achievements and outcomes for pupils.
47 Section 8.7 of this bill appropriates $19,314,297 in both Fiscal Year 2025-2026
48 and Fiscal Year 2026-2027 to the Interim Finance Committee for allocation to the
49 State Public Charter School Authority to provide money to charter schools for
50 salary increases for teachers and education support professionals. Section 8.7
51 requires each charter school in this State to submit certain information to the State
52 Public Charter School Authority, including the number of teachers and education
53 support professionals employed by the charter school on October 1, 2024, and
54 October 1, 2025, and a plan to provide such salary increases in each fiscal year.
55 Section 8.7 requires the State Public Charter School Authority to compile and
56 submit such information to the Interim Finance Committee as a condition for
57 receiving an allocation by the Interim Finance Committee from the appropriation
58 made by section 8.7. Section 8.7 provides the method for calculating the amount of
59 money from the appropriation which the State Public Charter School Authority may
60 distribute to each charter school.

39 Budget Act, the Governor shall, to the extent practicable, ensure that
40 an amount of money in the State General Fund is reserved in the
41 proposed executive budget for transfer to the State Education Fund
42 which is sufficient to fully fund:
43 (a) If the Economic Forum projects that the revenue collected by
44 the State for general, unrestricted uses will increase by a rate that is
45 greater than the combined rate of inflation and the growth of
-
*AB398_R1*
– 8 –
1 enrollment in the public schools in this State in the immediately
2 preceding biennium, an amount of money in the State General Fund
3 for transfer to the State Education Fund for the subsequent biennium
4 which is not less than the amount of money transferred to the State
5 Education Fund from the State General Fund for the immediately
6 preceding biennium increased by an amount not less than the rate of
7 increase for the revenue collected by the State as projected by the
8 Economic Forum.
9 (b) If the Economic Forum projects that the revenue collected by
10 the State for general, unrestricted uses will increase by a rate that is
11 not greater than the combined rate of inflation and the growth of
12 enrollment in the public schools in this State in the immediately
13 preceding biennium, an amount of money in the State General Fund
14 for transfer to the State Education Fund for the subsequent biennium
15 which is not less than the amount of money transferred to the State
16 Education Fund from the State General Fund for the immediately
17 preceding biennium increased by an amount not less than the
18 combined rate of inflation and the growth of enrollment in the
19 public schools in this State.
20 (c) If the Economic Forum projects that the revenue collected by
21 the State for general, unrestricted uses will decrease, an amount of
22 money in the State General Fund for transfer to the State Education
23 Fund for the subsequent biennium which is not less than the amount
24 of money transferred to the State Education Fund from the State
25 General Fund for the immediately preceding biennium decreased by
26 an amount not greater than the rate of decrease for the revenue
27 collected by the State as projected by the Economic Forum.
28 2. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 5, as part of the
29 proposed executive budget, the Governor shall, to the extent
30 practicable, include recommendations for:
31 (a) The statewide base per pupil funding amount, which must be
32 equal to the statewide base per pupil funding amount for the
33 immediately preceding biennium increased by an amount not less
34 than the combined rate of inflation and the growth of enrollment in
35 the public schools in this State unless the amount of money
36 contained in the State Education Fund, excluding the Education
37 Stabilization Account, decreases from the immediately preceding
38 biennium, in which event the Governor must recommend a
39 proportional reduction to both the statewide base per pupil funding
40 amount and the multiplier for each category of pupils pursuant to
41 paragraph (b); [and]
42 (b) The multiplier for each category of pupils, which must not
43 be less than the multiplier for the immediately preceding biennium
44 unless:
-
*AB398_R1*
– 9 –
1 (1) The amount of money contained in the State Education
2 Fund, excluding the Education Stabilization Account, decreases
3 from the immediately preceding biennium, in which event the
4 Governor must recommend a proportional reduction to both the
5 statewide base per pupil funding amount pursuant to paragraph (a)
6 and the multiplier for each category of pupils; or
7 (2) The amount of money contained in the State Education
8 Fund, excluding the Education Stabilization Account, increases
9 from the preceding fiscal year but in an amount which, after
10 recommending the statewide base per pupil funding amount
11 pursuant to paragraph (a), is insufficient to fund the multiplier for
12 each category of pupils, in which event the Governor must
13 recommend the remaining money in the State Education Fund,
14 excluding the Education Stabilization Account, be used to provide a
15 multiplier for each category of pupils which is as close as
16 practicable to the multiplier for the preceding fiscal year [.] ; and
17 (c) The amount of money to appropriate to the Department to
18 make awards to school districts pursuant to section 2 of this act.
19 3. When determining the amount of money to reserve for
20 transfer from the State General Fund to the State Education Fund
21 pursuant to subsection 1, the Governor shall consider the
22 recommendations of the Commission, as revised by the Joint
23 Interim Standing Committee on Education, if applicable, for an
24 optimal level of funding for education and may reserve an additional
25 amount of money for transfer to the State Education Fund that the
26 Governor determines to be sufficient to fund any recommendation
27 or any portion of a recommendation that the Governor includes in
28 the proposed executive budget.
29 4. As part of the proposed executive budget, the Governor may
30 recommend to the Legislature a revision to any appropriation made
31 by law pursuant to NRS 387.1214, including, without limitation, the
32 statewide base per pupil funding amount, the adjusted base per pupil
33 funding for any school district, the multiplier for weighted funding
34 for any category of pupils or the creation or elimination of a
35 category of pupils to receive additional weighted funding. The
36 Governor may recommend additional funding for any
37 recommendation made pursuant to this subsection.
38 5. If the Governor determines that it would be impracticable to
39 prepare the proposed executive budget as described in subsection 1
40 or 2, the Governor may instead include in the proposed executive
41 budget a recommendation for such funding for the public schools in
42 this State as he or she determines to be appropriate. If the Governor
43 includes in the proposed executive budget recommendations
44 pursuant to this subsection, the recommendations must be
45 accompanied by such recommendations for legislation as the
-
*AB398_R1*
– 10 –
1 Governor determines to be appropriate to improve the method by
2 which funding for the public schools in this State is determined.
3 6. As used in this section, “rate of inflation” means the average
4 percentage of increase or decrease in the Consumer Price Index for
5 All Urban Consumers, West Region (All Items), as published by the

8 States Department of Labor, the published index that most closely
9 resembles that index, as determined by the Governor.

FIRST REPRINT A.B. 398
ASSEMBLY BILL NO. 398–ASSEMBLYMEMBERS
YEAGER AND HAFEN
MARCH 11, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Ways and Means
SUMMARY—Revises provisions governing compensation for
certain employees of public schools. (BDR 34-189)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; requiring the Department of
Education to award money to school districts to provide
compensation in addition to base pay for hard-to-fill
positions in public schools; requiring school districts to
report certain information relating to hard-to-fill
positions; eliminating the authority in certain large school
districts to use weighted funding provided to a school for
certain pupils to pay certain hiring and retention
incentives; revising the powers of the Subcommittee on
Education Accountability of the Interim Finance
Committee; making an appropriation to the Interim
Finance Committee for allocation to the Department to
fund compensation in addition to base pay for hard-to-fill
positions in public schools; making an appropriation to
provide money to charter schools for salary increases for
teachers and education support professionals; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Section 2 of this bill requires the Department of Education, to the extent that
2 money has been appropriated for that purpose, to make awards to school districts to
3 provide compensation, in addition to base pay, for hard-to-fill positions in the
4 public schools of this State. Section 2 defines “hard-to-fill position” as including:
5 (1) teacher positions at certain Title I schools; and (2) teacher positions and other
6 positions filled by licensed educational personnel whose duties include actively
7 teaching pupils in certain subjects which are suffering from a critical labor
8 shortage. Section 2 requires each school district to submit a biennial report to the
-
*AB398_R1*

– 2 –
9 Office of Finance in the Office of the Governor and the Interim Finance Committee
10 regarding the number of teachers receiving such additional compensation, the total
11 amount of such additional compensation being provided in the school district and
12 the number of hard-to-fill positions in public schools in the school district. Section
13 8.9 of this bill imposes certain requirements for the contents of this report which are
14 applicable only to the report that is required to be submitted on or before
15 December 1, 2026.
16 Existing law requires the Governor, to the extent practicable, to include in the
17 proposed executive budget certain recommendations concerning education funding,
18 including recommendations for the statewide base per pupil funding amount and
19 the multiplier for each category of pupils. (NRS 387.12455) Section 8.1 of this bill
20 additionally requires the Governor, to the extent practicable, to include in the
21 proposed executive budget recommendations for the amount of money to
22 appropriate to the Department to make awards to school districts pursuant to
23 section 2.
24 Section 8.5 of this bill appropriates $45,000,000 in both Fiscal Year 2025-
25 2026 and Fiscal Year 2026-2027 to the Interim Finance Committee for allocation to
26 the Department to distribute to school districts to provide compensation, in addition
27 to base pay, for hard-to-fill positions in public schools. Section 8.5 establishes
28 certain requirements which must be satisfied before the money is allocated by the
29 Interim Finance Committee.
30 Under the Pupil-Centered Funding Plan, existing law requires a public school
31 that receives weighted funding for one or more at-risk pupils or pupils who are
32 English learners to use such funding only to provide services to such pupils, which
33 are referred to as “Victory services” and “Zoom services,” respectively. (NRS
34 387.121, 387.12445) Existing law authorizes the use of this weighted funding to
35 provide incentives for hiring and retaining teachers and other licensed educational
36 personnel who provide such services. (NRS 387.12445) Section 8 of this bill
37 eliminates the authority to use weighted funding to pay for such incentives in a
38 school district located in a county whose population is 700,000 or more (currently
39 the Clark County School District).
40 Existing law creates the Subcommittee on Educational Accountability of the
41 Interim Finance Committee and authorizes the Subcommittee to study various
42 matters related to accountability in public education. (NRS 218E.415) Section 8.3
43 of this bill additionally authorizes the Subcommittee to study the compensation
44 paid to teachers at public schools to determine whether such compensation is
45 sufficient to ensure competitiveness with other states and optimal educational
46 achievements and outcomes for pupils.
47 Section 8.7 of this bill appropriates $19,314,297 in both Fiscal Year 2025-2026
48 and Fiscal Year 2026-2027 to the Interim Finance Committee for allocation to the
49 State Public Charter School Authority to provide money to charter schools for
50 salary increases for teachers and education support professionals. Section 8.7
51 requires each charter school in this State to submit certain information to the State
52 Public Charter School Authority, including the number of teachers and education
53 support professionals employed by the charter school on October 1, 2024, and
54 October 1, 2025, and a plan to provide such salary increases in each fiscal year.
55 Section 8.7 requires the State Public Charter School Authority to compile and
56 submit such information to the Interim Finance Committee as a condition for
57 receiving an allocation by the Interim Finance Committee from the appropriation
58 made by section 8.7. Section 8.7 provides the method for calculating the amount of
59 money from the appropriation which the State Public Charter School Authority may
60 distribute to each charter school.

24 Department may require.
25 4. Money awarded to a school district pursuant to subsection

28 public schools.
29 5. Not later than December 1 of each even-numbered year,
30 each school district shall submit a report to the Office of Finance

33 receiving additional compensation funded pursuant to this section
34 during the then-current school year;
