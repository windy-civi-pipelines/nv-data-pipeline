Yeager and Hafen
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to education; requiring the Department of
Education to award money to school districts to provide
compensation in addition to base pay for hard-to-fill
positions in public schools; requiring school districts to
report certain information relating to hard-to-fill positions;
eliminating the authority in certain large school districts to
use weighted funding provided to a school for certain pupils
to pay certain hiring and retention incentives; revising the
powers of the Subcommittee on Education Accountability of
the Interim Finance Committee; making an appropriation to
the Interim Finance Committee for allocation to the
Department to fund compensation in addition to base pay for
hard-to-fill positions in public schools; making an
appropriation to provide money to charter schools for salary
increases for teachers and education support professionals;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Section 2 of this bill requires the Department of Education, to the extent that
money has been appropriated for that purpose, to make awards to school districts to
provide compensation, in addition to base pay, for hard-to-fill positions in the
public schools of this State. Section 2 defines “hard-to-fill position” as including:
(1) teacher positions at certain Title I schools; and (2) teacher positions and other
positions filled by licensed educational personnel whose duties include actively
teaching pupils in certain subjects which are suffering from a critical labor
shortage. Section 2 requires each school district to submit a biennial report to the
Office of Finance in the Office of the Governor and the Interim Finance Committee
regarding the number of teachers receiving such additional compensation, the total
amount of such additional compensation being provided in the school district and
the number of hard-to-fill positions in public schools in the school district. Section
8.9 of this bill imposes certain requirements for the contents of this report which are
applicable only to the report that is required to be submitted on or before
December 1, 2026.
Existing law requires the Governor, to the extent practicable, to include in the
proposed executive budget certain recommendations concerning education funding,
including recommendations for the statewide base per pupil funding amount and
the multiplier for each category of pupils. (NRS 387.12455) Section 8.1 of this bill
additionally requires the Governor, to the extent practicable, to include in the
proposed executive budget recommendations for the amount of money to
appropriate to the Department to make awards to school districts pursuant to
section 2.
Section 8.5 of this bill appropriates $45,000,000 in both Fiscal Year 2025-2026
and Fiscal Year 2026-2027 to the Interim Finance Committee for allocation to the
Department to distribute to school districts to provide compensation, in addition to
base pay, for hard-to-fill positions in public schools. Section 8.5 establishes certain
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 2 –
requirements which must be satisfied before the money is allocated by the Interim
Finance Committee.
Under the Pupil-Centered Funding Plan, existing law requires a public school
that receives weighted funding for one or more at-risk pupils or pupils who are
English learners to use such funding only to provide services to such pupils, which
are referred to as “Victory services” and “Zoom services,” respectively. (NRS
387.121, 387.12445) Existing law authorizes the use of this weighted funding to
provide incentives for hiring and retaining teachers and other licensed educational
personnel who provide such services. (NRS 387.12445) Section 8 of this bill
eliminates the authority to use weighted funding to pay for such incentives in a
school district located in a county whose population is 700,000 or more (currently
the Clark County School District).
Existing law creates the Subcommittee on Educational Accountability of the
Interim Finance Committee and authorizes the Subcommittee to study various
matters related to accountability in public education. (NRS 218E.415) Section 8.3
of this bill additionally authorizes the Subcommittee to study the compensation
paid to teachers at public schools to determine whether such compensation is
sufficient to ensure competitiveness with other states and optimal educational
achievements and outcomes for pupils.
Section 8.7 of this bill appropriates $19,314,297 in both Fiscal Year 2025-2026
and Fiscal Year 2026-2027 to the Interim Finance Committee for allocation to the
State Public Charter School Authority to provide money to charter schools for
salary increases for teachers and education support professionals. Section 8.7
requires each charter school in this State to submit certain information to the State
Public Charter School Authority, including the number of teachers and education
support professionals employed by the charter school on October 1, 2024, and
October 1, 2025, and a plan to provide such salary increases in each fiscal year.
Section 8.7 requires the State Public Charter School Authority to compile and
submit such information to the Interim Finance Committee as a condition for
receiving an allocation by the Interim Finance Committee from the appropriation
made by section 8.7. Section 8.7 provides the method for calculating the amount of
money from the appropriation which the State Public Charter School Authority may
distribute to each charter school.

the State for general, unrestricted uses will increase by a rate that is
greater than the combined rate of inflation and the growth of
enrollment in the public schools in this State in the immediately
preceding biennium, an amount of money in the State General Fund
for transfer to the State Education Fund for the subsequent biennium
which is not less than the amount of money transferred to the State
Education Fund from the State General Fund for the immediately
preceding biennium increased by an amount not less than the rate of
-

– 8 –
increase for the revenue collected by the State as projected by the
Economic Forum.
(b) If the Economic Forum projects that the revenue collected by
the State for general, unrestricted uses will increase by a rate that is

enrollment in the public schools in this State in the immediately
preceding biennium, an amount of money in the State General Fund
for transfer to the State Education Fund for the subsequent biennium
which is not less than the amount of money transferred to the State
Education Fund from the State General Fund for the immediately
preceding biennium increased by an amount not less than the
combined rate of inflation and the growth of enrollment in the
public schools in this State.

the State for general, unrestricted uses will decrease, an amount of
money in the State General Fund for transfer to the State Education
Fund for the subsequent biennium which is not less than the amount
of money transferred to the State Education Fund from the State
General Fund for the immediately preceding biennium decreased by
an amount not greater than the rate of decrease for the revenue
collected by the State as projected by the Economic Forum.
2. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 5, as part of the
proposed executive budget, the Governor shall, to the extent
practicable, include recommendations for:
(a) The statewide base per pupil funding amount, which must be
equal to the statewide base per pupil funding amount for the
immediately preceding biennium increased by an amount not less
than the combined rate of inflation and the growth of enrollment in
the public schools in this State unless the amount of money
contained in the State Education Fund, excluding the Education
Stabilization Account, decreases from the immediately preceding
biennium, in which event the Governor must recommend a
proportional reduction to both the statewide base per pupil funding
amount and the multiplier for each category of pupils pursuant to
paragraph (b); [and]
(b) The multiplier for each category of pupils, which must not
be less than the multiplier for the immediately preceding biennium
unless:

statewide base per pupil funding amount pursuant to paragraph (a)
and the multiplier for each category of pupils; or
(2) The amount of money contained in the State Education
Fund, excluding the Education Stabilization Account, increases
from the preceding fiscal year but in an amount which, after
recommending the statewide base per pupil funding amount
pursuant to paragraph (a), is insufficient to fund the multiplier for
each category of pupils, in which event the Governor must
recommend the remaining money in the State Education Fund,
excluding the Education Stabilization Account, be used to provide a
multiplier for each category of pupils which is as close as
practicable to the multiplier for the preceding fiscal year [.] ; and
(c) The amount of money to appropriate to the Department to
make awards to school districts pursuant to section 2 of this act.
3. When determining the amount of money to reserve for
transfer from the State General Fund to the State Education Fund

recommendations of the Commission, as revised by the Joint
Interim Standing Committee on Education, if applicable, for an
optimal level of funding for education and may reserve an additional
amount of money for transfer to the State Education Fund that the
Governor determines to be sufficient to fund any recommendation
or any portion of a recommendation that the Governor includes in
the proposed executive budget.
4. As part of the proposed executive budget, the Governor may
recommend to the Legislature a revision to any appropriation made
by law pursuant to NRS 387.1214, including, without limitation, the
statewide base per pupil funding amount, the adjusted base per pupil
funding for any school district, the multiplier for weighted funding
for any category of pupils or the creation or elimination of a
category of pupils to receive additional weighted funding. The
Governor may recommend additional funding for any
recommendation made pursuant to this subsection.
5. If the Governor determines that it would be impracticable to
prepare the proposed executive budget as described in subsection 1
or 2, the Governor may instead include in the proposed executive
budget a recommendation for such funding for the public schools in
this State as he or she determines to be appropriate. If the Governor
includes in the proposed executive budget recommendations
pursuant to this subsection, the recommendations must be
accompanied by such recommendations for legislation as the
Governor determines to be appropriate to improve the method by
which funding for the public schools in this State is determined.
