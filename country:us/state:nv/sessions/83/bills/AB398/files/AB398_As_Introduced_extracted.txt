FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; requiring additional support for the
State Education Fund to provide compensation in addition
to base pay for hard-to-fill positions in public schools;
requiring the Superintendent of Public Instruction to
apportion the amount allocated to provide such
compensation among school districts on a monthly basis;
eliminating the authority to use weighted funding
provided to a school for certain pupils to pay certain
hiring and retention incentives; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates the State Education Fund for the support of the operation
2 of the public schools in this State and requires that certain revenues of the State be
3 deposited in the Fund. In addition to these revenues, existing law requires support
4 for the State Education Fund to be provided by direct legislative appropriation in an
5 amount determined by the Legislature to be sufficient to fund the operation of
6 public schools in this State for the next ensuing biennium. (NRS 387.1212) After
7 this direct legislative appropriation is made, existing law directs the Legislature to
8 determine the statewide base per pupil funding amount for each fiscal year of the
9 biennium, which is the amount of money on a per pupil basis for the projected
10 enrollment of the public schools in this State which the Legislature determines is
11 sufficient to fund the cost of all public schools in this State to operate and provide
12 general education to all pupils, with the exception of certain expenses for which
13 specific funding is otherwise provided. (NRS 387.1214) Section 2 of this bill
14 requires that additional support for the State Education Fund be provided in an
15 amount determined by the Legislature to be sufficient to ameliorate high teacher
16 vacancy rates by providing compensation, in addition to base pay, for hard-to-fill
17 positions in the public schools of this State. Sections 2 and 6 of this bill exclude
-
*AB398*
– 2 –
18 this amount from the calculation of the base per pupil funding amount. Section 2
19 defines “hard-to-fill position” as including: (1) teacher positions at certain Title I
20 schools; and (2) teacher positions and other positions filled by licensed educational
21 personnel whose duties include actively teaching pupils in certain subjects which
22 are suffering from a critical labor shortage. Sections 2 and 5 of this bill authorize
23 the money for this amount to be appropriated to the State Education Fund from the
24 State General Fund or transferred, at the direction of the Legislature, from the
25 Education Stabilization Account.
26 Section 3 of this bill requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction to
27 apportion the money appropriated or transferred to the State Education Fund
28 pursuant to section 2 among the school districts in this State, on a monthly basis,
29 according to the yearly apportionment for each school district as specified by the
30 Legislature. Section 3 provides for the reversion of any such money which is not
31 committed for expenditure at the end of each fiscal year.
32 Sections 4, 6 and 7 of this bill exclude certain amounts appropriated or
33 transferred to the State Education Fund pursuant to section 2 from: (1) the money
34 upon which interest is earned for the State Education Fund; and (2) money in the
35 State Education Fund which must be used for certain purposes.
36 Under the Pupil-Centered Funding Plan, existing law requires a public school
37 that receives weighted funding for one or more at-risk pupils or pupils who are
38 English learners to use such funding only to provide services to such pupils, which
39 are referred to as “Victory services” and “Zoom services,” respectively. (NRS
40 387.121, 387.12445) Existing law authorizes the use of this weighted funding to
41 provide incentives for hiring and retaining teachers and other licensed educational
42 personnel who provide such services. (NRS 387.12445) Section 8 of this bill
43 eliminates the authority to use weighted funding to pay for such incentives.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 387 of NRS is hereby amended by adding
2 thereto the provisions set forth as sections 2 and 3 of this act.
3 Sec. 2. 1. In addition to money from any other source
4 provided by law, support for the State Education Fund must be
5 provided by:
6 (a) Direct legislative appropriation from the State General
7 Fund; or
8 (b) A transfer from the Education Stabilization Account as
9 directed by the Legislature,
10  in an amount determined by the Legislature to be sufficient to
11 ameliorate high teacher vacancy rates by providing compensation,
12 in addition to base pay, for hard-to-fill positions in the public
13 schools of this State.
14 2. It is the intent of the Legislature that the additional
15 compensation for hard-to-fill positions funded pursuant to
16 subsection 1 is a temporary solution to ameliorate the urgent
17 problem of high teacher vacancy rates, which are detrimental to
18 student outcomes. To the extent that the reporting on hard-to-fill
19 positions pursuant to subsection 4 demonstrates that such
-
*AB398*
– 3 –
1 positions no longer exist at a school district, the Legislature may
2 determine that such funding should not be provided to the school
3 district during a given biennium. It is the intent of the Legislature,
4 when making the appropriation or transfer pursuant to subsection
5 1, to specify the apportionment for each school district for each
6 fiscal year of the biennium.
7 3. Money received by a school district from an appropriation
8 or transfer made pursuant to subsection 1 is subject to collective
9 bargaining, but may only be used to provide additional
10 compensation for hard-to-fill positions.
11 4. It is the intent of the Legislature that money appropriated
12 or transferred to the State Education Fund pursuant to subsection
13 1 not be included when calculating the statewide base per pupil
14 funding amount for a fiscal year pursuant to NRS 387.1214.
15 5. Not later than August 1 of each year, each school district
16 shall submit a report to the Office of Finance and the Interim
17 Finance Committee that states the total number of hard-to-fill
18 positions in the school district and the number of such positions
19 which were vacant at the end of the immediately preceding school
20 year.
21 6. As used in this section, “hard-to-fill position” means:
22 (a) A teacher position at a Title I school which has:
23 (1) A vacancy rate for teacher positions of 15 percent or
24 more, if the school is a high school;
25 (2) A vacancy rate for teacher positions of 12 percent or
26 more, if the school is a middle school or junior high school; or
27 (3) A vacancy rate for teacher positions of 10 percent or
28 more, if the school is an elementary school.
29 (b) A teacher position or other position staffed by a person
30 licensed pursuant to chapter 391 of NRS:
31 (1) Who is the teacher of record assigned to a classroom of
32 pupils; and
33 (2) Whose duties include actively teaching pupils during a
34 class period, for the majority of class periods during the school
35 day, in English language arts, mathematics, science or special
36 education, if such subjects are suffering from a critical labor
37 shortage, as determined by the board of trustees of the school
38 district.
39 Sec. 3. 1. On or before the first day of each month, the
40 Superintendent of Public Instruction shall apportion the money
41 appropriated or transferred by the Legislature to the State
42 Education Fund pursuant to section 2 of this act among the
43 several county school districts in amounts approximating one-
44 twelfth of their respective yearly apportionments, as specified by
45 the Legislature.
-
*AB398*
– 4 –
1 2. A school district shall use the money apportioned to it to
2 provide compensation, in addition to base salary, for hard-to-fill
3 positions, in accordance with the provisions of section 2 of this act
4 and any applicable collective bargaining agreement.
5 3. To the extent that the money apportioned to a school
6 district includes both money appropriated from the State General
7 Fund and money transferred from the Education Stabilization
8 Account, a school district shall be deemed to have spent any
9 amount transferred from the Education Stabilization Account
10 before any amount appropriated from the State General Fund.
11 4. Any balance of the amount apportioned to a school district
12 pursuant to this section which is not committed for expenditure on
13 or before June 30 of the fiscal year in which the apportionment is
14 made reverts to the fund or account from which it was
15 appropriated or transferred.
16 5. As used in this section, “hard-to-fill position” has the
17 meaning ascribed to it in section 2 of this act.

1 3. In addition to money from any other source provided by law,
2 support for the State Education Fund must be provided by direct
3 legislative appropriation from the State General Fund in an amount
4 determined by the Legislature to be sufficient to fund the operation
5 of the public schools in this State for kindergarten through grade 12
6 for the next ensuing biennium for the population reasonably
7 estimated for that biennium. Money in the State Education Fund
8 does not revert to the State General Fund at the end of a fiscal year,
9 and the balance in the State Education Fund must be carried forward
10 to the next fiscal year.
11 4. Money in the Fund must be paid out on claims as other
12 claims against the State are paid.
13 Sec. 5. NRS 387.1213 is hereby amended to read as follows:
14 387.1213 1. The Education Stabilization Account is hereby
15 created in the State Education Fund. Except as otherwise provided
16 in this section, each year after the close of the previous fiscal year
17 and before the issuance of the State Controller’s annual report, each
18 county school district shall transfer from the county school district
19 fund to the Education Stabilization Account any amount by which
20 the actual ending fund balance of the county school district fund
21 exceeds 16.6 percent of the total actual expenditures for the fund.
22 The interest and income earned on the money in the Account, after
23 deducting any applicable charges, must be credited to the Account.
24 2. Money transferred pursuant to subsection 1 to the Education
25 Stabilization Account is a continuing appropriation solely for the
26 purpose of authorizing the expenditure of the transferred money for
27 the purposes set forth in this section [.] and section 2 of this act.
28 3. The balance in the Education Stabilization Account must not
29 exceed 20 percent of the total of all appropriations and
30 authorizations from the State Education Fund, excluding the
31 Education Stabilization Account, for the immediately preceding
32 fiscal year. Any money transferred to the Education Stabilization
33 Account which exceeds this amount must instead be transferred to
34 the State Education Fund.
35 4. If the Interim Finance Committee finds that:
36 (a) Upon submission of a request from the Department, the
37 actual enrollment growth for a fiscal year exceeds the projected
38 enrollment growth by an amount that the Interim Finance
39 Committee determines would make a transfer of money to the State
40 Education Fund necessary to fund the excess enrollment;
41 (b) The collection of revenue in any fiscal year will result in the
42 State Education Fund receiving less money than authorized for
43 expenditure from the State Education Fund;
-
*AB398*
– 7 –
1 (c) Upon submission of a request from the Department, any
2 amount of money which was deposited in the State Education Fund
3 is found by an audit to have been deposited in error; or
4 (d) Upon submission of a request from the Department, any
5 error in the application of the Pupil-Centered Funding Plan by the
6 Department has created a shortfall in the State Education Fund,
7  the Committee shall by resolution establish an amount of money
8 to transfer from the Education Stabilization Account to the State
9 Education Fund and direct the State Controller to transfer that
10 amount to the State Education Fund. The State Controller shall
11 thereupon make the transfer.
12 5. When determining the actual ending fund balance for the
13 purposes of subsection 1, each county school district shall exclude:
14 (a) Any money deposited in the county school district fund on or
15 before June 30, 2020;
16 (b) Any money apportioned to the county school district for
17 capital projects or debt service pursuant to subsection 2 of NRS
18 362.170 and deposited in the county school district fund when
19 authorized by law; and
20 (c) Any money transferred to the county school district and
21 authorized for expenditure as a continuing appropriation pursuant to
22 paragraph (b) of subsection 6 of NRS 387.1214.
23 6. If the Superintendent of Public Instruction determines that
24 the money due from the State Education Fund to a county school
25 district, charter school or university school for profoundly gifted
26 pupils pursuant to NRS 387.185 exceeds the amount of money
27 available in the State Education Fund because of a delay in expected
28 receipts, he or she may request from the Director of the Office of
29 Finance a temporary advance from the Education Stabilization
30 Account for the payment of such money due. Upon receipt of such a
31 request, the Director of the Office of Finance shall make a
32 recommendation to the Interim Finance Committee to approve the
33 temporary advance in whole or in part or to deny the request. If the
34 Interim Finance Committee approves the request in whole or in part,
35 the Director of the Office of Finance shall notify the State Controller
36 and the Fiscal Analysis Division of the Legislative Counsel Bureau
37 of the amount approved by the Interim Finance Committee, and the
38 State Controller shall draw his or her warrant upon receipt of such a
39 notice of approval. Any money which is temporarily advanced from
40 the Education Stabilization Account pursuant to this subsection
41 must be repaid by August 31 following the end of the fiscal year in
42 which the temporary advance is made.
43 7. The balance remaining in the State Education Fund,
44 excluding the balance remaining in the Education Stabilization
45 Account, that has not been committed for expenditure on or before
-
*AB398*
– 8 –
1 June 30 of an odd-numbered fiscal year must be transferred to the
2 Education Stabilization Account to the extent that such a transfer
3 would not cause the balance in the Education Stabilization Account
4 to exceed the limit established in subsection 3.
5 Sec. 6. NRS 387.1214 is hereby amended to read as follows:
6 387.1214 1. After a direct legislative appropriation is made to
7 the State Education Fund from the State General Fund pursuant to
8 NRS 387.1212, the Legislature shall determine the statewide base
9 per pupil funding amount for each fiscal year of the biennium,
10 which is the amount of money expressed on a per pupil basis for the
11 projected enrollment of the public schools in this State, determined
12 to be sufficient by the Legislature to fund the costs of all public
13 schools in this State to operate and provide general education to all
14 pupils for any purpose for which specific funding is not
15 appropriated pursuant to paragraph (a), (b) or (e) of subsection 2 or
16 NRS 387.122 [.] or section 2 of this act. It is the intent of the
17 Legislature that the statewide base per pupil funding amount for any
18 fiscal year, to the extent practicable, be not less than the statewide
19 base per pupil funding amount for the immediately preceding fiscal
20 year, adjusted by the rate of inflation, unless the amount of money
21 contained in the State Education Fund, excluding the Education
22 Stabilization Account, decreases from the preceding fiscal year. If
23 the amount of money contained in the State Education Fund,
24 excluding the Education Stabilization Account, decreases from the
25 preceding fiscal year, it is the intent of the Legislature that a
26 proportional reduction be made in both the statewide base per pupil
27 funding amount and the weighted funding appropriated pursuant to
28 paragraph (e) of subsection 2.
29 2. After a direct legislative appropriation is made to the State
30 Education Fund from the State General Fund pursuant to NRS
31 387.1212, the money in the State Education Fund, excluding any
32 amount of money in the Education Stabilization Account [,] or
33 money appropriated or transferred pursuant to section 2 of this
34 act, must be appropriated as established by law for each fiscal year
35 of the biennium for the following purposes:
36 (a) To each school district, an amount of money determined to
37 be sufficient by the Legislature, when combined with any other
38 resources available for this purpose, to provide food services and
39 transportation for pupils and any other similar service that the
40 Legislature deems appropriate.
41 (b) To each school district, charter school or university school
42 for profoundly gifted pupils, an amount of money determined to be
43 sufficient by the Legislature, when combined with any other
44 resources available for this purpose, to provide local funding to
45 support pupils with disabilities.
-
*AB398*
– 9 –
1 (c) To each school district, an amount of money determined to
2 be sufficient by the Legislature, when combined with any other
3 resources available for this purpose, to provide adjusted base per
4 pupil funding for each pupil estimated to be enrolled in the school
5 district.
6 (d) To each charter school or university school for profoundly
7 gifted pupils, an amount of money determined to be sufficient by the
8 Legislature, when combined with any other resources available for
9 this purpose, to provide:
10 (1) The statewide base per pupil funding amount for each
11 pupil estimated to be enrolled full-time in a program of distance
12 education provided by the charter school or university school for
13 profoundly gifted pupils; and
14 (2) Adjusted base per pupil funding for each pupil estimated
15 to be enrolled in the charter school or university school for
16 profoundly gifted pupils other than a pupil identified in
17 subparagraph (1).
18 (e) To each school district, charter school or university school
19 for profoundly gifted pupils, an amount of money determined to be
20 sufficient by the Legislature, when combined with any other
21 resources available for this purpose, to provide additional weighted
22 funding for each pupil estimated to be enrolled in the school district,
23 charter school or university school for profoundly gifted pupils who
24 is:
25 (1) An English learner;
26 (2) An at-risk pupil; or
27 (3) A gifted and talented pupil.
28 3. The adjusted base per pupil funding appropriated pursuant to
29 paragraph (c) of subsection 2 for each school district must be
30 determined by applying the cost adjustment factor established
31 pursuant to NRS 387.1215 which applies to the school district and
32 the attendance area adjustment established pursuant to NRS
33 387.1218 which applies to each applicable area of the school district
34 to the statewide base per pupil funding amount.
35 4. The adjusted base per pupil funding appropriated pursuant to
36 subparagraph (2) of paragraph (d) of subsection 2 for each charter
37 school or university school for profoundly gifted pupils must be
38 determined by applying the cost adjustment factor established
39 pursuant to NRS 387.1215 which applies to the charter school or
40 university school and, if applicable, the attendance area adjustment
41 established pursuant to NRS 387.1218 to the statewide base per
42 pupil funding amount.
43 5. The weighted funding appropriated pursuant to paragraph (e)
44 of subsection 2 must be established separately for each category of
45 pupils identified in that paragraph and expressed as a multiplier to
-
*AB398*
– 10 –
1 be applied to the statewide base per pupil funding amount
2 determined pursuant to subsection 1. A pupil who belongs to more
3 than one category of pupils or for whom a school district, charter
4 school or university school for profoundly gifted pupils is eligible to
5 receive the statewide multiplier pursuant to NRS 387.122 must
6 receive only the weighted funding for the single category to which
7 the pupil belongs which has the largest multiplier or the statewide
8 multiplier, whichever is larger. It is the intent of the Legislature that,
9 to the extent practicable:
10 (a) The multiplier for each category of pupils for any fiscal year
11 be not less than the multiplier for the immediately preceding fiscal
12 year unless:
13 (1) The amount of money contained in the State Education
14 Fund, excluding the Education Stabilization Account, decreases
15 from the preceding fiscal year, in which event it is the intent of the
16 Legislature that a proportional reduction be made in both the
17 statewide base per pupil funding amount and the weighted funding
18 appropriated pursuant to paragraph (e) of subsection 2; or
19 (2) The amount of money contained in the State Education
20 Fund, excluding the Education Stabilization Account, increases
21 from the preceding fiscal year but in an amount which, after funding
22 the appropriations required by paragraphs (a) to (d), inclusive, of
23 subsection 2, is insufficient to fund the multiplier for each category
24 of pupils, in which event it is the intent of the Legislature that the
25 remaining money in the State Education Fund be used to provide a
26 multiplier for each category of pupils which is as close as
27 practicable to the multiplier for the preceding fiscal year;
28 (b) The recommendations of the Commission for the multiplier
29 for each category of pupils be considered and the multiplier for one
30 category of pupils may be changed by an amount that is not
31 proportional to the change in the multiplier for one or more other
32 categories of pupils if the Legislature determines that a
33 disproportionate need to serve the pupils in the affected category
34 exists; and
35 (c) If the multipliers for all categories of pupils in a fiscal year
36 are increased from the multipliers in the immediately preceding
37 fiscal year, a proportional increase is considered for the statewide
38 base per pupil funding amount.
39 6. For any money identified in subsection 4 of NRS 362.170
40 which is deposited to the credit of the State Education Fund:
41 (a) The amount of such money for the county from which the
42 money was collected that does not exceed the total amount of
43 money appropriated pursuant to subsection 2 to the county school
44 district is deemed to be the first money appropriated pursuant to
45 subsection 2 for that county school district and the first money spent
-
*AB398*
– 11 –
1 by that county school district from the county school district fund
2 during the applicable fiscal year.
3 (b) The amount of such money for the county from which the
4 money was collected which exceeds the total amount of money
5 appropriated pursuant to subsection 2 to the county school district
6 must be transferred to the county school district and is hereby
7 authorized for expenditure as a continuing appropriation for the
8 purpose of mitigating the adverse effects of the cyclical nature of
9 the industry of extracting and processing minerals on the ability of
10 the county school district to offer its pupils a reasonably equal
11 educational opportunity.
12 7. The weighted funding appropriated pursuant to paragraph (e)
13 of subsection 2:
14 (a) May not be used to settle or arbitrate disputes between a
15 recognized organization representing employees of a school district
16 or the governing body of a charter school and the school district or
17 governing body or to settle any negotiations; and
18 (b) May not be used to adjust the district-wide schedules of
19 salaries and benefits of the employees of a school district.
20 8. As used in this section, “rate of inflation” has the meaning
21 ascribed to it in NRS 387.12455.
22 Sec. 7. NRS 387.124 is hereby amended to read as follows:
23 387.124 Except as otherwise provided in this section and NRS
24 387.1241, 387.1242 and 387.528:
25 1. On or before the first day of each month, the Superintendent
26 of Public Instruction shall apportion the State Education Fund
27 among the several county school districts, charter schools and
28 university schools for profoundly gifted pupils in amounts
29 approximating one-twelfth of their respective yearly apportionments
30 less any amount set aside as a reserve , appropriated or transferred
31 pursuant to section 2 of this act or contained in the Education
32 Stabilization Account. Except as otherwise provided in NRS
33 387.1244, the apportionment to a school district, computed on a
34 yearly basis, equals the amounts established by law for each school
35 year pursuant to paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (e) of subsection 2 of
36 NRS 387.1214 for all pupils who attend a public school operated by
37 the school district located in the county.
38 2. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 387.1244, in addition
39 to the apportionments made pursuant to this section, if a pupil is
40 enrolled part-time in a program of distance education and part-time
41 in a:
42 (a) Public school other than a charter school, an apportionment
43 must be made to the school district in which the pupil resides. The
44 school district in which the pupil resides shall allocate a percentage
45 of the apportionment to the school district or charter school that
-
*AB398*
– 12 –
1 provides the program of distance education in the amount set forth
2 in the agreement entered into pursuant to NRS 388.854.
3 (b) Charter school, an apportionment must be made to the
4 charter school in which the pupil is enrolled. The charter school in
5 which the pupil is enrolled shall allocate a percentage of the
6 apportionment to the school district or charter school that provides
7 the program of distance education in the amount set forth in the
8 agreement entered into pursuant to NRS 388.858.
9 3. The Director of the State Department of Agriculture shall
10 apportion, on or before August 1 of each year, the money designated
11 as the “Nutrition State Match” pursuant to NRS 387.105 to those
12 school districts that participate in the National School Lunch
13 Program, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1751 et seq. The apportionment to a school
14 district must be directly related to the district’s reimbursements for
15 the Program as compared with the total amount of reimbursements
16 for all school districts in this State that participate in the Program.
17 Sec. 8. NRS 387.12445 is hereby amended to read as follows:
18 387.12445 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2,
19 each school district shall ensure that all adjusted base per pupil
20 funding received by the school district pursuant to paragraph (c) of
21 subsection 2 of NRS 387.1214 is accounted for separately and, after
22 a deduction for the administrative expenses of the school district in
23 an amount which does not exceed the amount prescribed by the
24 Department by regulation for each school district, be distributed and
25 used as described in this subsection. The adjusted base per pupil
26 funding provided to each school district must:
27 (a) Be distributed by each school district to its public schools in
28 a manner that ensures each pupil in the school district receives a
29 reasonably equal educational opportunity.
30 (b) Be used to support the educational needs of all pupils in the
31 school district, including, without limitation, operating each public
32 school in the school district, training and supporting educational
33 personnel and carrying out any program or service established by, or
34 requirement imposed pursuant to, this title for any purpose for
35 which specific funding is not appropriated pursuant to paragraph (a),
36 (b) or (e) of subsection 2 of NRS 387.1214 or NRS 387.122.
37 2. If a school district determines that an additional amount of
38 money is necessary to satisfy requirements for maintenance of effort
39 or any other requirement under federal law for pupils with
40 disabilities enrolled in the school district, the school district may
41 transfer the necessary amount of money from the adjusted base per
42 pupil funding received by the school district for that purpose.
43 3. Each school district shall ensure that all weighted funding
44 received by the school district pursuant to paragraph (e) of
45 subsection 2 of NRS 387.1214 is accounted for separately and
-
*AB398*
– 13 –
1 distributed directly to each school in which the relevant pupils are
2 estimated to be enrolled.
3 4. Each public school shall account separately for the local
4 funding for pupils with disabilities received by the public school
5 pursuant to paragraph (b) of subsection 2 of NRS 387.1214, for the
6 adjusted base per pupil funding received by the public school
7 pursuant to paragraph (c) of subsection 2 of NRS 387.1214, for each
8 category of weighted funding received by the public school pursuant
9 to paragraph (e) of subsection 2 of NRS 387.1214 and for money
10 received from the statewide multiplier pursuant to NRS 387.122.
11 Unless the provisions of subsection 7 or 8 impose greater
12 restrictions on the use of weighted funding by a public school, the
13 public school must use the weighted funding received for each
14 relevant pupil:
15 (a) As a supplement to the adjusted base per pupil funding
16 received for the pupil; and
17 (b) Solely for the purpose of providing such additional
18 educational programs, services or support as are necessary to ensure
19 the pupil receives a reasonably equal educational opportunity.
20 5. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 6, the separate
21 accounting required by subsection 4 for pupils with disabilities and
22 gifted and talented pupils must include:
23 (a) The amount of money provided to the public school for
24 special education; and
25 (b) The cost of:

27 teachers and supporting staff;
28 (2) Related services, including, without limitation, services
29 provided by psychologists, therapists and health-related personnel;

33 programs; and
34 (5) The supplies and equipment needed for providing special
35 education.
36 6. Money received from federal sources must be accounted for
37 separately and excluded from the accounting required pursuant to
38 subsection 5.
39 7. A public school that receives weighted funding for one or
40 more at-risk pupils must use that weighted funding only to provide
41 Victory services and, if one or more at-risk pupils for whom the
42 school received weighted funding in the at-risk pupil category also
43 belong to one or more other categories of pupils who receive
44 weighted funding, the additional services for each such at-risk pupil
-

– 14 –
1 which are appropriate for each category to which the at-risk pupil
2 belongs.
3 8. A public school that receives weighted funding for one or
4 more pupils who are English learners must use that weighted
5 funding only to provide Zoom services and, if one or more English
6 learners for whom the school received weighted funding in the
7 English learner category also belong to one or more other categories
8 of pupils who receive weighted funding, the additional services for
9 each such English learner which are appropriate for each category to
10 which the English learner belongs.
11 9. The Department shall adopt regulations prescribing the
12 maximum amount of money that each school district may deduct for
13 its administrative expenses from the adjusted base per pupil funding
14 received by the school district. When adopting such regulations, the
15 Department may express the maximum amount of money that may
16 be deducted as a percentage of the adjusted base per pupil funding
17 received by the school district.

A.B. 398
ASSEMBLY BILL NO. 398–ASSEMBLYMEMBER YEAGER
MARCH 11, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Ways and Means
SUMMARY—Provides for additional compensation for certain
hard-to-fill positions at public schools.
(BDR 34-189)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; requiring additional support for the
State Education Fund to provide compensation in addition
to base pay for hard-to-fill positions in public schools;
requiring the Superintendent of Public Instruction to
apportion the amount allocated to provide such
compensation among school districts on a monthly basis;
eliminating the authority to use weighted funding
provided to a school for certain pupils to pay certain
hiring and retention incentives; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates the State Education Fund for the support of the operation
2 of the public schools in this State and requires that certain revenues of the State be
3 deposited in the Fund. In addition to these revenues, existing law requires support
4 for the State Education Fund to be provided by direct legislative appropriation in an
5 amount determined by the Legislature to be sufficient to fund the operation of
6 public schools in this State for the next ensuing biennium. (NRS 387.1212) After
7 this direct legislative appropriation is made, existing law directs the Legislature to
8 determine the statewide base per pupil funding amount for each fiscal year of the
9 biennium, which is the amount of money on a per pupil basis for the projected
10 enrollment of the public schools in this State which the Legislature determines is
11 sufficient to fund the cost of all public schools in this State to operate and provide
12 general education to all pupils, with the exception of certain expenses for which
13 specific funding is otherwise provided. (NRS 387.1214) Section 2 of this bill
14 requires that additional support for the State Education Fund be provided in an
15 amount determined by the Legislature to be sufficient to ameliorate high teacher
16 vacancy rates by providing compensation, in addition to base pay, for hard-to-fill
17 positions in the public schools of this State. Sections 2 and 6 of this bill exclude
-
*AB398*

– 2 –
18 this amount from the calculation of the base per pupil funding amount. Section 2
19 defines “hard-to-fill position” as including: (1) teacher positions at certain Title I
20 schools; and (2) teacher positions and other positions filled by licensed educational
21 personnel whose duties include actively teaching pupils in certain subjects which
22 are suffering from a critical labor shortage. Sections 2 and 5 of this bill authorize
23 the money for this amount to be appropriated to the State Education Fund from the
24 State General Fund or transferred, at the direction of the Legislature, from the
25 Education Stabilization Account.
26 Section 3 of this bill requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction to
27 apportion the money appropriated or transferred to the State Education Fund
28 pursuant to section 2 among the school districts in this State, on a monthly basis,
29 according to the yearly apportionment for each school district as specified by the
30 Legislature. Section 3 provides for the reversion of any such money which is not
31 committed for expenditure at the end of each fiscal year.
32 Sections 4, 6 and 7 of this bill exclude certain amounts appropriated or
33 transferred to the State Education Fund pursuant to section 2 from: (1) the money
34 upon which interest is earned for the State Education Fund; and (2) money in the
35 State Education Fund which must be used for certain purposes.
36 Under the Pupil-Centered Funding Plan, existing law requires a public school
37 that receives weighted funding for one or more at-risk pupils or pupils who are
38 English learners to use such funding only to provide services to such pupils, which
39 are referred to as “Victory services” and “Zoom services,” respectively. (NRS
40 387.121, 387.12445) Existing law authorizes the use of this weighted funding to
41 provide incentives for hiring and retaining teachers and other licensed educational
42 personnel who provide such services. (NRS 387.12445) Section 8 of this bill
43 eliminates the authority to use weighted funding to pay for such incentives.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 387 of NRS is hereby amended by adding
2 thereto the provisions set forth as sections 2 and 3 of this act.
3 Sec. 2. 1. In addition to money from any other source
4 provided by law, support for the State Education Fund must be
5 provided by:
6 (a) Direct legislative appropriation from the State General
7 Fund; or
8 (b) A transfer from the Education Stabilization Account as
9 directed by the Legislature,
10  in an amount determined by the Legislature to be sufficient to
11 ameliorate high teacher vacancy rates by providing compensation,
12 in addition to base pay, for hard-to-fill positions in the public
13 schools of this State.
14 2. It is the intent of the Legislature that the additional
15 compensation for hard-to-fill positions funded pursuant to
16 subsection 1 is a temporary solution to ameliorate the urgent
17 problem of high teacher vacancy rates, which are detrimental to
18 student outcomes. To the extent that the reporting on hard-to-fill
19 positions pursuant to subsection 4 demonstrates that such
-
*AB398*

– 3 –
1 positions no longer exist at a school district, the Legislature may
2 determine that such funding should not be provided to the school
3 district during a given biennium. It is the intent of the Legislature,
4 when making the appropriation or transfer pursuant to subsection
5 1, to specify the apportionment for each school district for each
6 fiscal year of the biennium.
7 3. Money received by a school district from an appropriation
8 or transfer made pursuant to subsection 1 is subject to collective
9 bargaining, but may only be used to provide additional
10 compensation for hard-to-fill positions.
11 4. It is the intent of the Legislature that money appropriated
12 or transferred to the State Education Fund pursuant to subsection
13 1 not be included when calculating the statewide base per pupil
14 funding amount for a fiscal year pursuant to NRS 387.1214.
15 5. Not later than August 1 of each year, each school district
16 shall submit a report to the Office of Finance and the Interim
17 Finance Committee that states the total number of hard-to-fill
18 positions in the school district and the number of such positions
19 which were vacant at the end of the immediately preceding school
20 year.
21 6. As used in this section, “hard-to-fill position” means:
22 (a) A teacher position at a Title I school which has:
23 (1) A vacancy rate for teacher positions of 15 percent or
24 more, if the school is a high school;
25 (2) A vacancy rate for teacher positions of 12 percent or
26 more, if the school is a middle school or junior high school; or
27 (3) A vacancy rate for teacher positions of 10 percent or
28 more, if the school is an elementary school.
29 (b) A teacher position or other position staffed by a person
30 licensed pursuant to chapter 391 of NRS:
31 (1) Who is the teacher of record assigned to a classroom of
32 pupils; and
33 (2) Whose duties include actively teaching pupils during a
34 class period, for the majority of class periods during the school
35 day, in English language arts, mathematics, science or special
36 education, if such subjects are suffering from a critical labor
37 shortage, as determined by the board of trustees of the school
38 district.
39 Sec. 3. 1. On or before the first day of each month, the
40 Superintendent of Public Instruction shall apportion the money
41 appropriated or transferred by the Legislature to the State
42 Education Fund pursuant to section 2 of this act among the
43 several county school districts in amounts approximating one-
44 twelfth of their respective yearly apportionments, as specified by
45 the Legislature.
-
*AB398*

– 4 –
1 2. A school district shall use the money apportioned to it to
2 provide compensation, in addition to base salary, for hard-to-fill
3 positions, in accordance with the provisions of section 2 of this act
4 and any applicable collective bargaining agreement.
5 3. To the extent that the money apportioned to a school
6 district includes both money appropriated from the State General
7 Fund and money transferred from the Education Stabilization
8 Account, a school district shall be deemed to have spent any
9 amount transferred from the Education Stabilization Account
10 before any amount appropriated from the State General Fund.
11 4. Any balance of the amount apportioned to a school district
12 pursuant to this section which is not committed for expenditure on
13 or before June 30 of the fiscal year in which the apportionment is
14 made reverts to the fund or account from which it was
15 appropriated or transferred.
16 5. As used in this section, “hard-to-fill position” has the
17 meaning ascribed to it in section 2 of this act.
18 Sec. 4. NRS 387.1212 is hereby amended to read as follows:
19 387.1212 1. The State Education Fund is hereby created as a
20 special revenue fund to be administered by the Superintendent of
21 Public Instruction for the purpose of supporting the operation of the
22 public schools in this State. The interest and income earned on the
23 money in the Fund, excluding the direct legislative appropriation
24 from the State General Fund required by subsection 3 [,] or any
25 direct legislative appropriation made pursuant to section 2 of this
26 act, must, after deducting any applicable charges, be credited to the
27 Fund.
28 2. Money which must be deposited for credit to the State
29 Education Fund includes, without limitation:
30 (a) All money derived from interest on the State Permanent
31 School Fund, as provided in NRS 387.030;
32 (b) The proceeds of the tax imposed pursuant to NRS 244.33561
33 and any applicable penalty or interest, less any amount retained by
34 the county treasurer for the actual cost of collecting and
35 administering the tax;
36 (c) The proceeds of the tax imposed pursuant to subsection 1 of
37 NRS 387.195;

39 (e) The portion of the money in each special account created

1 3. In addition to money from any other source provided by law,
2 support for the State Education Fund must be provided by direct
3 legislative appropriation from the State General Fund in an amount
4 determined by the Legislature to be sufficient to fund the operation
5 of the public schools in this State for kindergarten through grade 12
6 for the next ensuing biennium for the population reasonably
7 estimated for that biennium. Money in the State Education Fund
8 does not revert to the State General Fund at the end of a fiscal year,
9 and the balance in the State Education Fund must be carried forward
10 to the next fiscal year.
11 4. Money in the Fund must be paid out on claims as other
12 claims against the State are paid.
13 Sec. 5. NRS 387.1213 is hereby amended to read as follows:
14 387.1213 1. The Education Stabilization Account is hereby
15 created in the State Education Fund. Except as otherwise provided
16 in this section, each year after the close of the previous fiscal year
17 and before the issuance of the State Controller’s annual report, each
18 county school district shall transfer from the county school district
19 fund to the Education Stabilization Account any amount by which
20 the actual ending fund balance of the county school district fund
21 exceeds 16.6 percent of the total actual expenditures for the fund.
22 The interest and income earned on the money in the Account, after
23 deducting any applicable charges, must be credited to the Account.
24 2. Money transferred pursuant to subsection 1 to the Education
25 Stabilization Account is a continuing appropriation solely for the
26 purpose of authorizing the expenditure of the transferred money for
27 the purposes set forth in this section [.] and section 2 of this act.
28 3. The balance in the Education Stabilization Account must not
29 exceed 20 percent of the total of all appropriations and
30 authorizations from the State Education Fund, excluding the
31 Education Stabilization Account, for the immediately preceding
32 fiscal year. Any money transferred to the Education Stabilization
33 Account which exceeds this amount must instead be transferred to
34 the State Education Fund.
35 4. If the Interim Finance Committee finds that:
36 (a) Upon submission of a request from the Department, the
37 actual enrollment growth for a fiscal year exceeds the projected
38 enrollment growth by an amount that the Interim Finance
39 Committee determines would make a transfer of money to the State
40 Education Fund necessary to fund the excess enrollment;
41 (b) The collection of revenue in any fiscal year will result in the
42 State Education Fund receiving less money than authorized for
43 expenditure from the State Education Fund;
-
*AB398*

– 7 –
1 (c) Upon submission of a request from the Department, any
2 amount of money which was deposited in the State Education Fund
3 is found by an audit to have been deposited in error; or
4 (d) Upon submission of a request from the Department, any
5 error in the application of the Pupil-Centered Funding Plan by the
6 Department has created a shortfall in the State Education Fund,
7  the Committee shall by resolution establish an amount of money
8 to transfer from the Education Stabilization Account to the State
9 Education Fund and direct the State Controller to transfer that
10 amount to the State Education Fund. The State Controller shall
11 thereupon make the transfer.
12 5. When determining the actual ending fund balance for the
13 purposes of subsection 1, each county school district shall exclude:
14 (a) Any money deposited in the county school district fund on or
15 before June 30, 2020;
16 (b) Any money apportioned to the county school district for
17 capital projects or debt service pursuant to subsection 2 of NRS
18 362.170 and deposited in the county school district fund when
19 authorized by law; and
20 (c) Any money transferred to the county school district and
21 authorized for expenditure as a continuing appropriation pursuant to
22 paragraph (b) of subsection 6 of NRS 387.1214.
23 6. If the Superintendent of Public Instruction determines that
24 the money due from the State Education Fund to a county school
25 district, charter school or university school for profoundly gifted
26 pupils pursuant to NRS 387.185 exceeds the amount of money
27 available in the State Education Fund because of a delay in expected
28 receipts, he or she may request from the Director of the Office of
29 Finance a temporary advance from the Education Stabilization
30 Account for the payment of such money due. Upon receipt of such a
31 request, the Director of the Office of Finance shall make a
32 recommendation to the Interim Finance Committee to approve the
33 temporary advance in whole or in part or to deny the request. If the
34 Interim Finance Committee approves the request in whole or in part,
35 the Director of the Office of Finance shall notify the State Controller
36 and the Fiscal Analysis Division of the Legislative Counsel Bureau
37 of the amount approved by the Interim Finance Committee, and the
38 State Controller shall draw his or her warrant upon receipt of such a
39 notice of approval. Any money which is temporarily advanced from
40 the Education Stabilization Account pursuant to this subsection
41 must be repaid by August 31 following the end of the fiscal year in
42 which the temporary advance is made.
43 7. The balance remaining in the State Education Fund,
44 excluding the balance remaining in the Education Stabilization
45 Account, that has not been committed for expenditure on or before
-
*AB398*

– 8 –
1 June 30 of an odd-numbered fiscal year must be transferred to the
2 Education Stabilization Account to the extent that such a transfer
3 would not cause the balance in the Education Stabilization Account
4 to exceed the limit established in subsection 3.
5 Sec. 6. NRS 387.1214 is hereby amended to read as follows:
6 387.1214 1. After a direct legislative appropriation is made to
7 the State Education Fund from the State General Fund pursuant to
8 NRS 387.1212, the Legislature shall determine the statewide base
9 per pupil funding amount for each fiscal year of the biennium,
10 which is the amount of money expressed on a per pupil basis for the
11 projected enrollment of the public schools in this State, determined
12 to be sufficient by the Legislature to fund the costs of all public
13 schools in this State to operate and provide general education to all
14 pupils for any purpose for which specific funding is not
15 appropriated pursuant to paragraph (a), (b) or (e) of subsection 2 or
16 NRS 387.122 [.] or section 2 of this act. It is the intent of the
17 Legislature that the statewide base per pupil funding amount for any
18 fiscal year, to the extent practicable, be not less than the statewide
19 base per pupil funding amount for the immediately preceding fiscal
20 year, adjusted by the rate of inflation, unless the amount of money
21 contained in the State Education Fund, excluding the Education
22 Stabilization Account, decreases from the preceding fiscal year. If
23 the amount of money contained in the State Education Fund,
24 excluding the Education Stabilization Account, decreases from the
25 preceding fiscal year, it is the intent of the Legislature that a
26 proportional reduction be made in both the statewide base per pupil
27 funding amount and the weighted funding appropriated pursuant to
28 paragraph (e) of subsection 2.
29 2. After a direct legislative appropriation is made to the State
30 Education Fund from the State General Fund pursuant to NRS
31 387.1212, the money in the State Education Fund, excluding any
32 amount of money in the Education Stabilization Account [,] or
33 money appropriated or transferred pursuant to section 2 of this
34 act, must be appropriated as established by law for each fiscal year
35 of the biennium for the following purposes:
36 (a) To each school district, an amount of money determined to
37 be sufficient by the Legislature, when combined with any other
38 resources available for this purpose, to provide food services and
39 transportation for pupils and any other similar service that the
40 Legislature deems appropriate.
41 (b) To each school district, charter school or university school
42 for profoundly gifted pupils, an amount of money determined to be
43 sufficient by the Legislature, when combined with any other
44 resources available for this purpose, to provide local funding to
45 support pupils with disabilities.
-
*AB398*

– 9 –
1 (c) To each school district, an amount of money determined to
2 be sufficient by the Legislature, when combined with any other
3 resources available for this purpose, to provide adjusted base per
4 pupil funding for each pupil estimated to be enrolled in the school
5 district.
6 (d) To each charter school or university school for profoundly
7 gifted pupils, an amount of money determined to be sufficient by the
8 Legislature, when combined with any other resources available for
9 this purpose, to provide:
10 (1) The statewide base per pupil funding amount for each
11 pupil estimated to be enrolled full-time in a program of distance
12 education provided by the charter school or university school for
13 profoundly gifted pupils; and
14 (2) Adjusted base per pupil funding for each pupil estimated
15 to be enrolled in the charter school or university school for
16 profoundly gifted pupils other than a pupil identified in
17 subparagraph (1).
18 (e) To each school district, charter school or university school
19 for profoundly gifted pupils, an amount of money determined to be
20 sufficient by the Legislature, when combined with any other
21 resources available for this purpose, to provide additional weighted
22 funding for each pupil estimated to be enrolled in the school district,
23 charter school or university school for profoundly gifted pupils who
24 is:
25 (1) An English learner;
26 (2) An at-risk pupil; or
27 (3) A gifted and talented pupil.
28 3. The adjusted base per pupil funding appropriated pursuant to
29 paragraph (c) of subsection 2 for each school district must be
30 determined by applying the cost adjustment factor established
31 pursuant to NRS 387.1215 which applies to the school district and
32 the attendance area adjustment established pursuant to NRS
33 387.1218 which applies to each applicable area of the school district
34 to the statewide base per pupil funding amount.
35 4. The adjusted base per pupil funding appropriated pursuant to
36 subparagraph (2) of paragraph (d) of subsection 2 for each charter
37 school or university school for profoundly gifted pupils must be
38 determined by applying the cost adjustment factor established
39 pursuant to NRS 387.1215 which applies to the charter school or
40 university school and, if applicable, the attendance area adjustment
41 established pursuant to NRS 387.1218 to the statewide base per
42 pupil funding amount.
43 5. The weighted funding appropriated pursuant to paragraph (e)
44 of subsection 2 must be established separately for each category of
45 pupils identified in that paragraph and expressed as a multiplier to
-
*AB398*

– 10 –
1 be applied to the statewide base per pupil funding amount
2 determined pursuant to subsection 1. A pupil who belongs to more
3 than one category of pupils or for whom a school district, charter
4 school or university school for profoundly gifted pupils is eligible to
5 receive the statewide multiplier pursuant to NRS 387.122 must
6 receive only the weighted funding for the single category to which
7 the pupil belongs which has the largest multiplier or the statewide
8 multiplier, whichever is larger. It is the intent of the Legislature that,
9 to the extent practicable:
10 (a) The multiplier for each category of pupils for any fiscal year
11 be not less than the multiplier for the immediately preceding fiscal
12 year unless:
13 (1) The amount of money contained in the State Education
14 Fund, excluding the Education Stabilization Account, decreases
15 from the preceding fiscal year, in which event it is the intent of the
16 Legislature that a proportional reduction be made in both the
17 statewide base per pupil funding amount and the weighted funding
18 appropriated pursuant to paragraph (e) of subsection 2; or
19 (2) The amount of money contained in the State Education
20 Fund, excluding the Education Stabilization Account, increases
21 from the preceding fiscal year but in an amount which, after funding
22 the appropriations required by paragraphs (a) to (d), inclusive, of
23 subsection 2, is insufficient to fund the multiplier for each category
24 of pupils, in which event it is the intent of the Legislature that the
25 remaining money in the State Education Fund be used to provide a
26 multiplier for each category of pupils which is as close as
27 practicable to the multiplier for the preceding fiscal year;
28 (b) The recommendations of the Commission for the multiplier
29 for each category of pupils be considered and the multiplier for one
30 category of pupils may be changed by an amount that is not
31 proportional to the change in the multiplier for one or more other
32 categories of pupils if the Legislature determines that a
33 disproportionate need to serve the pupils in the affected category
34 exists; and
35 (c) If the multipliers for all categories of pupils in a fiscal year
36 are increased from the multipliers in the immediately preceding
37 fiscal year, a proportional increase is considered for the statewide
38 base per pupil funding amount.
39 6. For any money identified in subsection 4 of NRS 362.170
40 which is deposited to the credit of the State Education Fund:
41 (a) The amount of such money for the county from which the
42 money was collected that does not exceed the total amount of
43 money appropriated pursuant to subsection 2 to the county school
44 district is deemed to be the first money appropriated pursuant to
45 subsection 2 for that county school district and the first money spent
-
*AB398*

– 11 –
1 by that county school district from the county school district fund
2 during the applicable fiscal year.
3 (b) The amount of such money for the county from which the
4 money was collected which exceeds the total amount of money
5 appropriated pursuant to subsection 2 to the county school district
6 must be transferred to the county school district and is hereby
7 authorized for expenditure as a continuing appropriation for the
8 purpose of mitigating the adverse effects of the cyclical nature of
9 the industry of extracting and processing minerals on the ability of
10 the county school district to offer its pupils a reasonably equal
11 educational opportunity.
12 7. The weighted funding appropriated pursuant to paragraph (e)
13 of subsection 2:
14 (a) May not be used to settle or arbitrate disputes between a
15 recognized organization representing employees of a school district
16 or the governing body of a charter school and the school district or
17 governing body or to settle any negotiations; and
18 (b) May not be used to adjust the district-wide schedules of
19 salaries and benefits of the employees of a school district.
20 8. As used in this section, “rate of inflation” has the meaning
21 ascribed to it in NRS 387.12455.
22 Sec. 7. NRS 387.124 is hereby amended to read as follows:
23 387.124 Except as otherwise provided in this section and NRS
24 387.1241, 387.1242 and 387.528:
25 1. On or before the first day of each month, the Superintendent
26 of Public Instruction shall apportion the State Education Fund
27 among the several county school districts, charter schools and
28 university schools for profoundly gifted pupils in amounts
29 approximating one-twelfth of their respective yearly apportionments
30 less any amount set aside as a reserve , appropriated or transferred
31 pursuant to section 2 of this act or contained in the Education
32 Stabilization Account. Except as otherwise provided in NRS
33 387.1244, the apportionment to a school district, computed on a
34 yearly basis, equals the amounts established by law for each school
35 year pursuant to paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (e) of subsection 2 of
36 NRS 387.1214 for all pupils who attend a public school operated by
37 the school district located in the county.
38 2. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 387.1244, in addition
39 to the apportionments made pursuant to this section, if a pupil is
40 enrolled part-time in a program of distance education and part-time
41 in a:
42 (a) Public school other than a charter school, an apportionment
43 must be made to the school district in which the pupil resides. The
44 school district in which the pupil resides shall allocate a percentage
45 of the apportionment to the school district or charter school that
-
*AB398*

– 12 –
1 provides the program of distance education in the amount set forth
2 in the agreement entered into pursuant to NRS 388.854.
3 (b) Charter school, an apportionment must be made to the
4 charter school in which the pupil is enrolled. The charter school in
5 which the pupil is enrolled shall allocate a percentage of the
6 apportionment to the school district or charter school that provides
7 the program of distance education in the amount set forth in the
8 agreement entered into pursuant to NRS 388.858.
9 3. The Director of the State Department of Agriculture shall
10 apportion, on or before August 1 of each year, the money designated
11 as the “Nutrition State Match” pursuant to NRS 387.105 to those
12 school districts that participate in the National School Lunch
13 Program, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1751 et seq. The apportionment to a school
14 district must be directly related to the district’s reimbursements for
15 the Program as compared with the total amount of reimbursements
16 for all school districts in this State that participate in the Program.
17 Sec. 8. NRS 387.12445 is hereby amended to read as follows:
18 387.12445 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2,
19 each school district shall ensure that all adjusted base per pupil
20 funding received by the school district pursuant to paragraph (c) of
21 subsection 2 of NRS 387.1214 is accounted for separately and, after
22 a deduction for the administrative expenses of the school district in
23 an amount which does not exceed the amount prescribed by the
24 Department by regulation for each school district, be distributed and
25 used as described in this subsection. The adjusted base per pupil
26 funding provided to each school district must:
27 (a) Be distributed by each school district to its public schools in
28 a manner that ensures each pupil in the school district receives a
29 reasonably equal educational opportunity.
30 (b) Be used to support the educational needs of all pupils in the
31 school district, including, without limitation, operating each public
32 school in the school district, training and supporting educational
33 personnel and carrying out any program or service established by, or
34 requirement imposed pursuant to, this title for any purpose for
35 which specific funding is not appropriated pursuant to paragraph (a),
36 (b) or (e) of subsection 2 of NRS 387.1214 or NRS 387.122.
37 2. If a school district determines that an additional amount of
38 money is necessary to satisfy requirements for maintenance of effort
39 or any other requirement under federal law for pupils with
40 disabilities enrolled in the school district, the school district may
41 transfer the necessary amount of money from the adjusted base per
42 pupil funding received by the school district for that purpose.
43 3. Each school district shall ensure that all weighted funding
44 received by the school district pursuant to paragraph (e) of
45 subsection 2 of NRS 387.1214 is accounted for separately and
-
*AB398*

– 13 –
1 distributed directly to each school in which the relevant pupils are
2 estimated to be enrolled.
3 4. Each public school shall account separately for the local
4 funding for pupils with disabilities received by the public school

6 adjusted base per pupil funding received by the public school
7 pursuant to paragraph (c) of subsection 2 of NRS 387.1214, for each
8 category of weighted funding received by the public school pursuant
9 to paragraph (e) of subsection 2 of NRS 387.1214 and for money
10 received from the statewide multiplier pursuant to NRS 387.122.
11 Unless the provisions of subsection 7 or 8 impose greater
12 restrictions on the use of weighted funding by a public school, the
13 public school must use the weighted funding received for each
14 relevant pupil:
15 (a) As a supplement to the adjusted base per pupil funding
16 received for the pupil; and
17 (b) Solely for the purpose of providing such additional
18 educational programs, services or support as are necessary to ensure
19 the pupil receives a reasonably equal educational opportunity.

36 6. Money received from federal sources must be accounted for
37 separately and excluded from the accounting required pursuant to
38 subsection 5.
39 7. A public school that receives weighted funding for one or
40 more at-risk pupils must use that weighted funding only to provide
41 Victory services and, if one or more at-risk pupils for whom the
42 school received weighted funding in the at-risk pupil category also
43 belong to one or more other categories of pupils who receive
44 weighted funding, the additional services for each such at-risk pupil
-

– 14 –
1 which are appropriate for each category to which the at-risk pupil
2 belongs.
3 8. A public school that receives weighted funding for one or
4 more pupils who are English learners must use that weighted
5 funding only to provide Zoom services and, if one or more English
6 learners for whom the school received weighted funding in the
7 English learner category also belong to one or more other categories
8 of pupils who receive weighted funding, the additional services for
9 each such English learner which are appropriate for each category to
10 which the English learner belongs.
11 9. The Department shall adopt regulations prescribing the
12 maximum amount of money that each school district may deduct for
13 its administrative expenses from the adjusted base per pupil funding
14 received by the school district. When adopting such regulations, the
15 Department may express the maximum amount of money that may
16 be deducted as a percentage of the adjusted base per pupil funding
17 received by the school district.
