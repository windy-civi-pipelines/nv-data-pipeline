AN ACT relating to Medicaid; requiring Medicaid to cover the administration of
certain medication for persons with opioid use disorder and certain
mental health services provided at a federally-qualified health center;
making an appropriation; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Department of Health and Human Services to administer
2 Medicaid. (NRS 422.270) Section 1.2 of this bill requires the Director of the Department
3 to include under Medicaid coverage for the administration of certain medication to treat
4 opioid use disorder. Section 1.1 of this bill defines “medication assisted treatment” for
5 that purpose. Section 1.3 of this bill establishes the applicability of that definition, and
6 section 1.5 of this bill eliminates a duplicative definition. Section 1.6 of this bill makes a
7 conforming change to require the Director to administer the provisions of sections 1.1
8 and 1.2 in the same manner as the provisions of existing law governing Medicaid.
9 Section 1.7 of this bill requires the transfer of certain money and authorizes the
10 expenditure of certain money to carry out the provisions of section 1.2.
11 The policies of the Department of Health and Human Services provide that Medicaid will
12 provide coverage of services provided by a psychiatrist, psychologist, advanced practice
13 registered nurse, marriage and family therapist or licensed clinical social worker at a
14 federally-qualified health center. (Medicaid Services Manual 2903(B)(1)) In 2023, federal law
15 was amended to authorize federal financial participation for Medicaid coverage of services
16 provided by mental health counselors, including alcohol and drug counselors who hold a
17 master’s or doctoral degree and clinical professional counselors, when such services are
18 provided in a federally-qualified health center. (42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(10), 42 U.S.C. §
19 1396d(a)(2)(c), 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(l)(2); Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023, Pub. L.
20 No. 117-328, § 4121) [This] Section 1.4 of this bill: (1) codifies into law existing
21 requirements that Medicaid cover services provided by a psychiatrist, psychologist, advanced
22 practice registered nurse, marriage and family therapist or licensed clinical social worker at a
23 federally-qualified health center; (2) newly requires Medicaid to cover services provided by a
24 clinical professional counselor, licensed alcohol and drug counselor or licensed clinical
25 alcohol and drug counselor at a federally qualified health center; and (3) newly requires
26 Medicaid to cover services provided by a master’s level intern in any of those professions
27 practicing in a federally-qualified health center under supervision. Section 1.8 of this bill

Senate Amendment No. 760 to Senate Bill No. 300 First Reprint Page 4
28 appropriates certain money and authorizes the expenditure of certain money to carry
29 out the provisions of section 1.4.
