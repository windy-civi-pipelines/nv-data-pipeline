CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to Medicaid; requiring Medicaid to cover the
administration of certain medication for persons with opioid
use disorder and certain mental health services provided at a
federally-qualified health center; making an appropriation;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law requires the Department of Health and Human Services to
administer Medicaid. (NRS 422.270) Section 1.2 of this bill requires the Director
of the Department to include under Medicaid coverage for the administration of
certain medication to treat opioid use disorder. Section 1.1 of this bill defines
“medication assisted treatment” for that purpose. Section 1.3 of this bill establishes
the applicability of that definition, and section 1.5 of this bill eliminates a
duplicative definition. Section 1.6 of this bill makes a conforming change to
require the Director to administer the provisions of sections 1.1 and 1.2 in the same
manner as the provisions of existing law governing Medicaid. Section 1.7 of this
bill requires the transfer of certain money and authorizes the expenditure of certain
money to carry out the provisions of section 1.2.
The policies of the Department of Health and Human Services provide that
Medicaid will provide coverage of services provided by a psychiatrist,
psychologist, advanced practice registered nurse, marriage and family therapist or
licensed clinical social worker at a federally-qualified health center. (Medicaid
Services Manual 2903(B)(1)) In 2023, federal law was amended to authorize
federal financial participation for Medicaid coverage of services provided by
mental health counselors, including alcohol and drug counselors who hold a
master’s or doctoral degree and clinical professional counselors, when such
services are provided in a federally-qualified health center. (42 U.S.C. §
1396a(a)(10), 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(a)(2)(c), 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(l)(2); Consolidated
Appropriations Act of 2023, Pub. L. No. 117-328, § 4121) Section 1.4 of this bill:
(1) codifies into law existing requirements that Medicaid cover services provided
by a psychiatrist, psychologist, advanced practice registered nurse, marriage and
family therapist or licensed clinical social worker at a federally-qualified health
center; (2) newly requires Medicaid to cover services provided by a clinical
professional counselor, licensed alcohol and drug counselor or licensed clinical
alcohol and drug counselor at a federally qualified health center; and (3) newly
requires Medicaid to cover services provided by a master’s level intern in any of
those professions practicing in a federally-qualified health center under supervision.
Section 1.8 of this bill appropriates certain money and authorizes the expenditure
of certain money to carry out the provisions of section 1.4.
