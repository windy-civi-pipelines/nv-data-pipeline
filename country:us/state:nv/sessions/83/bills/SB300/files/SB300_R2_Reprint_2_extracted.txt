EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to Medicaid; requiring Medicaid to cover the
administration of certain medication for persons with
opioid use disorder and certain mental health services
provided at a federally-qualified health center; making an
appropriation; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Department of Health and Human Services to
2 administer Medicaid. (NRS 422.270) Section 1.2 of this bill requires the Director
3 of the Department to include under Medicaid coverage for the administration of
4 certain medication to treat opioid use disorder. Section 1.1 of this bill defines
5 “medication assisted treatment” for that purpose. Section 1.3 of this bill establishes
6 the applicability of that definition, and section 1.5 of this bill eliminates a
7 duplicative definition. Section 1.6 of this bill makes a conforming change to
8 require the Director to administer the provisions of sections 1.1 and 1.2 in the same
9 manner as the provisions of existing law governing Medicaid. Section 1.7 of this
10 bill requires the transfer of certain money and authorizes the expenditure of certain
11 money to carry out the provisions of section 1.2.
12 The policies of the Department of Health and Human Services provide that
13 Medicaid will provide coverage of services provided by a psychiatrist,
14 psychologist, advanced practice registered nurse, marriage and family therapist or
15 licensed clinical social worker at a federally-qualified health center. (Medicaid
16 Services Manual 2903(B)(1)) In 2023, federal law was amended to authorize
17 federal financial participation for Medicaid coverage of services provided by
18 mental health counselors, including alcohol and drug counselors who hold a
19 master’s or doctoral degree and clinical professional counselors, when such
20 services are provided in a federally-qualified health center. (42 U.S.C. §

24 by a psychiatrist, psychologist, advanced practice registered nurse, marriage and
25 family therapist or licensed clinical social worker at a federally-qualified health
26 center; (2) newly requires Medicaid to cover services provided by a clinical
27 professional counselor, licensed alcohol and drug counselor or licensed clinical
28 alcohol and drug counselor at a federally qualified health center; and (3) newly
29 requires Medicaid to cover services provided by a master’s level intern in any of
30 those professions practicing in a federally-qualified health center under supervision.
31 Section 1.8 of this bill appropriates certain money and authorizes the expenditure
32 of certain money to carry out the provisions of section 1.4.
