Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 The policies of the Department of Health and Human Services provide that Medicaid will
2 provide coverage of services provided by a psychiatrist, psychologist, advanced practice
3 registered nurse, marriage and family therapist or licensed clinical social worker at a
4 federally-qualified health center. (Medicaid Services Manual 2903(B)(1)) In 2023, federal law
5 was amended to authorize federal financial participation for Medicaid coverage of services
6 provided by mental health counselors, including alcohol and drug counselors [and problem
7 gambling counselors] who hold a master’s or doctoral degree and clinical professional
8 counselors, when such services are provided in a federally-qualified health center. (42 U.S.C.
9 § 1396a(10), 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(a)(2)(c), 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(1)(2); Consolidated
10 Appropriations Act of 2023, Pub. L. No. 117-328, § 4121) This bill: (1) codifies into law
11 existing requirements that Medicaid cover services provided by a psychiatrist, psychologist,
12 advanced practice registered nurse, marriage and family therapist or licensed clinical social
13 worker at a federally-qualified health center; [and] (2) newly requires Medicaid to cover
14 services provided by a [mental health counselor.] clinical professional counselor, licensed
15 alcohol and drug counselor or licensed clinical alcohol and drug counselor at a federally
16 qualified health center; and (3) newly requires Medicaid to cover services provided by a
17 master’s level intern in any of those professions practicing in a federally-qualified health
18 center under supervision.
