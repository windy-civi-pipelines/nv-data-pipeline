Legislative Counsel’s Digest:

3 Medicine; and (2) requires a physician assistant to work under the supervision of a
4 physician or osteopathic physician. (NRS 630.271, 630.275, 633.432-633.469)
5 Sections 5-9, 16 and 18-20 of this bill remove the requirement that a physician
6 assistant be supervised by a physician or osteopathic physician. Sections 6, 13, 21,
7 22, 24, 27, 28, 59, 76-79, 85, 93, 162, 163, 187, 189, 190, 192, 194, 196-198, 200

13 require a physician assistant who changes the field of medicine within which the
14 physician assistant practices to enter into a collaborative agreement with a
15 physician until the physician assistant has practiced in that field for a certain
16 amount of time. Sections 4 and 15 also prescribe the settings in which a physician
17 assistant is authorized to practice. Sections 7 and 18: (1) require a physician
18 assistant to obtain the informed consent of a patient before providing any medical
19 service; (2) prescribe medical services that a physician assistant is authorized to
20 perform; and (3) require a physician assistant to only perform such services within
21 his or her scope of practice and which he or she has the necessary education,
22 training and experience to competently perform. Sections 9 and 20 remove a
23 requirement that the Board of Medical Examiners and the State Board of
24 Osteopathic Medicine adopt regulations governing the testing or examination of
25 applicants for licensure as a physician assistant and the services which a physician
26 assistant may perform. Sections 1-3, 10-12, 14, 17, 23-26, 29-58, 60-75, 80-92, 94-

32 172 also add advanced practice registered nurses to certain provisions to ensure that
33 physician assistants and advanced practice registered nurses have similar authority.

35 governing the: (1) administration, possession, dispensing, storage, security,
36 recordkeeping and transportation of controlled substances by a physician assistant;
37 and (2) administration, possession, prescription, dispensing, storage, security,
38 recordkeeping and transportation of dangerous drugs, poisons and devices by a
39 physician assistant. (NRS 639.1373) Section 28 removes a requirement that the

41 those regulations.

43 where medical services are provided by a physician assistant or advanced practice
44 registered nurse under the supervision of a physician. (NRS 449.0175) Section 122
45 of this bill removes the requirement that a rural clinic be supervised by physician.
46 Sections 131, 134, 135, 138, 140, 142 and 144 of this bill make conforming
47 changes so that the definition of the term “attending physician assistant” set forth in

50 changes so that the definition of the term “attending physician assistant” set forth in

31 recipient or recipients of the payments, the dollar amount of the
32 payments, the interval between payments, and the number of
33 payments or the period of time over which payments will be made.
34 Such payments must only be subject to modification in the event of
35 the death of the judgment creditor. Money damages awarded for loss

37 reason of the death of the judgment creditor, but must be paid to
38 persons to whom the judgment creditor owed a duty of support, as
39 provided by law, immediately before the judgment creditor’s death.
40 In such cases, the court that rendered the original judgment may,
41 upon petition of any party in interest, modify the judgment to award
42 and apportion the unpaid future damages in accordance with this
43 subsection.
44 6. If the court finds that the judgment debtor has exhibited a
45 continuing pattern of failing to make the periodic payments as
-
*SB294*
– 40 –
1 specified pursuant to subsection 5, the court shall find the judgment
2 debtor in contempt of court and, in addition to the required periodic
3 payments, shall order the judgment debtor to pay the judgment
4 creditor all damages caused by the failure to make such periodic
5 payments, including, but not limited to, court costs and attorney’s
6 fees.

10 a physician, to determine if an emergency medical condition or
11 active labor exists and, if it does, the care, treatment and surgery by

17 (I) There is inadequate time before delivery to transfer the

22 acute symptoms of sufficient severity, including severe pain, such

27 (III) Serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part.
28 (b) “Medically fit” means that the condition of the patient has
29 been sufficiently stabilized so that the patient may be safely
30 transported to another hospital, or is such that, in the determination
31 of the attending physician, the transfer of the patient constitutes an
32 acceptable risk. Such a determination must be based upon the
33 condition of the patient, the expected benefits, if any, to the patient
34 resulting from the transfer and whether the risks to the patient’s
35 health are outweighed by the expected benefits, and must be
36 documented in the patient’s records before the transfer.

38 2 is made against a hospital licensed pursuant to the provisions of

SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to physician assistants.
(BDR 54-965)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to physician assistants; prescribing the settings in
which a physician assistant is authorized to practice;
eliminating provisions requiring the supervision of a
physician assistant by a physician; authorizing a physician
assistant to perform certain medical services under certain
circumstances; eliminating provisions governing the
testing or examination of applicants for licensure as a
physician assistant; prescribing certain authority and
duties of a physician assistant and an advanced practice
registered nurse; removing the requirement that a rural
clinic be supervised by a physician; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law: (1) provides for the licensure and regulation of physician
2 assistants by the Board of Medical Examiners and the State Board of Osteopathic
3 Medicine; and (2) requires a physician assistant to work under the supervision of a
4 physician or osteopathic physician. (NRS 630.271, 630.275, 633.432-633.469)
5 Sections 5-9, 16 and 18-20 of this bill remove the requirement that a physician
6 assistant be supervised by a physician or osteopathic physician. Sections 6, 13, 21,
7 22, 24, 27, 28, 59, 76-79, 85, 93, 162, 163, 187, 189, 190, 192, 194, 196-198, 200
8 and 204 of this bill remove references to supervision of a physician assistant by a
9 physician or osteopathic physician. Sections 4 and 15 of this bill: (1) require a
10 physician assistant who has practiced for less than 4,000 hours as a physician
11 assistant to enter into a collaborative agreement with a physician; and (2) authorize
12 the Board of Medical Examiners and the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine to
-

– 2 –
13 require a physician assistant who changes the field of medicine within which the
14 physician assistant practices to enter into a collaborative agreement with a
15 physician until the physician assistant has practiced in that field for a certain
16 amount of time. Sections 4 and 15 also prescribe the settings in which a physician
17 assistant is authorized to practice. Sections 7 and 18: (1) require a physician
18 assistant to obtain the informed consent of a patient before providing any medical
19 service; (2) prescribe medical services that a physician assistant is authorized to
20 perform; and (3) require a physician assistant to only perform such services within
21 his or her scope of practice and which he or she has the necessary education,
22 training and experience to competently perform. Sections 9 and 20 remove a
23 requirement that the Board of Medical Examiners and the State Board of
24 Osteopathic Medicine adopt regulations governing the testing or examination of
25 applicants for licensure as a physician assistant and the services which a physician
26 assistant may perform. Sections 1-3, 10-12, 14, 17, 23-26, 29-58, 60-75, 80-92, 94-
27 121, 123-130, 132-139, 141, 143, 145-147, 149-151, 153-158, 160, 161, 164-186,
28 188, 191, 193, 195, 197, 199 and 201-203 of this bill make various changes so that
29 physician assistants have similar authority and duties to other providers of health
30 care who provide medical services independently and are otherwise treated in the
31 same manner as other such providers of health care. Sections 46, 61, 120, 136 and
32 172 also add advanced practice registered nurses to certain provisions to ensure that
33 physician assistants and advanced practice registered nurses have similar authority.
34 Existing law requires the State Board of Pharmacy to adopt regulations
35 governing the: (1) administration, possession, dispensing, storage, security,
36 recordkeeping and transportation of controlled substances by a physician assistant;
37 and (2) administration, possession, prescription, dispensing, storage, security,
38 recordkeeping and transportation of dangerous drugs, poisons and devices by a
39 physician assistant. (NRS 639.1373) Section 28 removes a requirement that the
40 Board consider the experience and training of the physician assistant when adopting
41 those regulations.
42 Existing law defines a rural clinic to mean a medical facility in a rural area
43 where medical services are provided by a physician assistant or advanced practice
44 registered nurse under the supervision of a physician. (NRS 449.0175) Section 122
45 of this bill removes the requirement that a rural clinic be supervised by physician.
46 Sections 131, 134, 135, 138, 140, 142 and 144 of this bill make conforming
47 changes so that the definition of the term “attending physician assistant” set forth in
48 section 128 applies to certain provisions governing withholding or withdrawal of

41 upon petition of any party in interest, modify the judgment to award
42 and apportion the unpaid future damages in accordance with this
43 subsection.
44 6. If the court finds that the judgment debtor has exhibited a
45 continuing pattern of failing to make the periodic payments as
-
*SB294*

– 40 –
1 specified pursuant to subsection 5, the court shall find the judgment
2 debtor in contempt of court and, in addition to the required periodic
3 payments, shall order the judgment debtor to pay the judgment
4 creditor all damages caused by the failure to make such periodic
5 payments, including, but not limited to, court costs and attorney’s

11 understand what this means.
12 If I am sick or hurt, my agent should take me to the doctor
13 , physician assistant or [an] advanced practice registered
14 nurse. If my agent is not with me when I become sick or hurt,
15 please contact my agent and ask him or her to come to the
16 doctor’s , physician assistant’s or advanced practice
17 registered nurse’s office. I would like the doctor , physician
18 assistant or advanced practice registered nurse to speak with
19 my agent and me about my sickness or injury and whether I
20 need any medicine or other treatment. After we speak with
21 the doctor , physician assistant or advanced practice
22 registered nurse, I would like my agent to speak with me
23 about the care or treatment. When we have made decisions
24 about the care or treatment, my agent will tell the doctor ,

28 would like my agent to help me decide if I need to go to the
29 hospital. If I go to the hospital, I would like the people who
30 work at the hospital to try very hard to care for me. If I am

32 assistant or advanced practice registered nurse at the hospital
33 to speak with me and my agent about what care or treatment I
34 should receive, even if I am unable to understand what is

36 physician assistant or advanced practice registered nurse, I
37 would like my agent to help me decide what care or treatment
38 I should receive. Once we decide, my agent will sign any
39 necessary paperwork. If I am unable to communicate because
40 of my illness or injury, I would like my agent to make
41 decisions about my care or treatment based on what he or she
42 thinks I would do and what is best for me.
43 I would like my agent to help me decide if I need to see a
44 dentist and help me make decisions about what care or
-

4 copies of all my medical records. If my agent requests to see
5 or have copies of my medical records, please allow him or her
6 to see or have copies of the records.
7 I understand that my agent cannot make me receive any
8 care or treatment that I do not want. I also understand that I
9 can take away this power from my agent at any time, either
10 by telling my agent that he or she is no longer my agent or by
11 putting it in writing.

5 benefits shall allow a recipient of Medicaid who has been diagnosed
6 with stage 3 or 4 cancer or the attending practitioner of the recipient

43 application is complete, or request additional information or
44 documentation necessary to complete the application not later than
45 72 hours after receiving the application; and
-
*SB294*

– 79 –
1 (b) If it requests additional information or documentation, make
2 a determination concerning the application not later than 72 hours
3 after receiving the requested information or documentation.
4 4. If, in the opinion of the attending practitioner, step therapy

25 indications, clinical guidelines or other peer-reviewed evidence;
26 (b) Delay of effective treatment would have severe or
27 irreversible consequences for the recipient and the treatment

12 amount of time to establish stability in relation to the cancer and the
13 guidelines of the prescribing practitioner; and
14 (2) Any other relevant clinical information.

16 documentation that is not necessary to make a determination about
17 the application.
18 3. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 4, a managed

21 (a) Make a determination concerning the application if the
22 application is complete or request additional information or

25 (b) If it requests additional information or documentation, make
26 a determination concerning the application not later than 72 hours
27 after receiving the requested information or documentation.
28 4. If, in the opinion of the attending practitioner, a step therapy

1 of the insured when prescribed in accordance with clinical
2 indications, clinical guidelines or other peer-reviewed evidence;
3 (b) Delay of effective treatment would have severe or
4 irreversible consequences for the insured and the treatment
5 otherwise required under the step therapy is not reasonably expected
6 to be effective based on the physical or mental characteristics of the
7 insured and the known characteristics of the treatment;
8 (c) Each treatment otherwise required under the step therapy:
9 (1) Is contraindicated for the insured or has caused or is
10 likely, based on peer-reviewed clinical evidence, to cause an adverse
11 reaction or other physical harm to the insured; or

22 an exemption from a step therapy protocol pursuant to this section,
23 the managed care organization must cover the prescription drug to
24 which the exemption applies in accordance with the terms of the
25 applicable health care plan. The managed care organization may
26 initially limit the coverage to a 1-week supply of the drug for which
27 the exemption is granted. If the attending practitioner determines
28 after 1 week that the drug is effective at treating the cancer or
29 symptom for which it was prescribed, the managed care
30 organization must continue to cover the drug for as long as it is
31 necessary to treat the insured for the cancer or symptom. The
32 managed care organization may conduct a review not more
33 frequently than once each quarter to determine, in accordance with
34 available medical evidence, whether the drug remains necessary to
35 treat the insured for the cancer or symptom. The managed care
36 organization shall provide a report of the review to the insured.
37 8. A managed care organization shall post in an easily
38 accessible location on an Internet website maintained by the

40 pursuant to this section.
41 9. A health care plan subject to the provisions of this chapter
42 that is delivered, issued for delivery or renewed on or after
43 January 1, 2022, has the legal effect of including the coverage
44 required by this section, and any provision of the health care plan
