Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law: (1) provides for the licensure and regulation of physician assistants by the
2 Board of Medical Examiners and the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine; and (2) requires a
3 physician assistant to work under the supervision of a physician or osteopathic physician.
4 (NRS 630.271, 630.275, 633.432-633.469) [Sections 5-9, 16 and 18-20 of this bill remove the
5 requirement that a physician assistant be supervised by a physician or osteopathic physician.
6 Sections 6, 13, 21, 22, 24, 27, 28, 59, 76-79, 85, 93, 162, 163, 187, 189, 190, 192, 194, 196-
7 198, 200 and 204 of this bill remove references to supervision of a physician assistant by a
8 physician or osteopathic physician. Sections 4 and 15 of this bill: (1) require a physician
9 assistant who has practiced for less than 4,000 hours as a physician assistant to enter into a
10 collaborative agreement with a physician; and (2) authorize the Board of Medical Examiners
11 and the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine to require a physician assistant who changes the

18 assistant to only perform such services within his or her scope of practice and which he or she
19 has the necessary education, training and experience to competently perform.] Existing
20 regulations, with certain exceptions, prohibit a supervising physician or osteopathic
21 physician from simultaneously supervising more than three physician assistants. (NAC
22 630.495, 633.288) Sections [9 and 20 remove a requirement that] 1 and 2 of this bill require
23 the Board of Medical Examiners and the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine to adopt
24 regulations [governing the testing or examination of applicants for licensure as] which
25 authorize a supervising physician [assistant and the services which a] or osteopathic
26 physician [assistant may perform. Sections 1-3, 10-12, 14, 17, 23-26, 29-58, 60-75, 80-92, 94-

30 providers of health care who provide medical services independently and are otherwise treated
31 in the same manner as other such providers of health care. Sections 46, 61, 120, 136 and 172
32 also add advanced practice registered nurses to certain provisions to ensure that physician
33 assistants and advanced practice registered nurses have similar authority.
34 Existing law requires the State Board of Pharmacy to adopt regulations governing the: (1)
35 administration, possession, dispensing, storage, security, recordkeeping and transportation of
36 controlled substances by a physician assistant; and (2) administration, possession,
37 prescription, dispensing, storage, security, recordkeeping and transportation of dangerous
38 drugs, poisons and devices by a physician assistant. (NRS 639.1373) Section 28 removes a
39 requirement that the Board consider the experience and training of the physician assistant
40 when adopting those regulations.
41 Existing law defines a rural clinic to mean a medical facility in a rural area where medical
42 services are provided by a physician assistant or advanced practice registered nurse under the
43 supervision of a physician. (NRS 449.0175) Section 122 of this bill removes the requirement
44 that a rural clinic be supervised by physician.
