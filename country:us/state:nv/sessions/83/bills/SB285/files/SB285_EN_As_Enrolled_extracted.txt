federal regulations governing apprenticeships. (NRS 607.035) Existing law
additionally requires the Labor Commissioner to oversee the State Apprenticeship
Council and State Apprenticeship Director and sets forth certain duties the Director
must perform under the direction of the Labor Commissioner. (NRS 607.035,

Section 2:

Existing law sets forth various requirements for a proposed apprenticeship
program to be eligible for registration and approval by the State Apprenticeship
Council. (NRS 610.144) Section 2 of this bill requires a program, if the program
provides training in more than one specified construction trade, to contain separate
standards for each such trade. Section 3 of this bill provides that if a set of
standards that does not comply with the provisions of section 2 has been approved
for a program before October 1, 2025, the program may continue to use that set of
standards until the set of standards is voided or superseded.
