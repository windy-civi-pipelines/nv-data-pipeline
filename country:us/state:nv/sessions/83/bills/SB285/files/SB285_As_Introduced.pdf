AN ACT relating to apprenticeships; prohibiting the issuance of an
interim credential to an apprentice in an apprenticeship
program for a construction trade; revising the
requirements for the eligibility for registration and
approval of a proposed apprenticeship program for a
construction trade; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law makes the Office of the Labor Commissioner responsible and
2 accountable for apprenticeship in this State and requires the Office of the Labor
3 Commissioner to act as the State Apprenticeship Agency for the purposes of certain
4 federal regulations governing apprenticeships. (NRS 607.035) Existing law
5 additionally requires the Labor Commissioner to oversee the State Apprenticeship
6 Council and State Apprenticeship Director and sets forth certain duties the Director
7 must perform under the direction of the Labor Commissioner. (NRS 607.035,
8 610.120)
9 Existing federal regulations define “interim credential” to mean, in general, a
10 credential issued by the federal Office of Apprenticeship of the Employment and
11 Training Administration of the United States Department of Labor or a State
12 Apprenticeship Agency, upon request of the appropriate sponsor, as certification of
13 competency attainment by an apprentice. (29 C.F.R. § 29.2) Existing federal
14 regulations set forth certain requirements for apprenticeship programs that choose
15 to issue interim credentials. (29 C.F.R. § 29.5) Section 1 of this bill prohibits the
16 Labor Commissioner from issuing or directing the Director to issue an interim
17 credential to an apprentice in an apprenticeship program for a construction trade.
18 Existing law sets forth various requirements for a proposed apprenticeship
19 program to be eligible for registration and approval by the State Apprenticeship
20 Council. (NRS 610.144) Section 2 of this bill requires a program, if the program
21 provides training in more than one construction trade, to contain separate standards
22 for each such trade. Section 2 additionally prohibits a program from containing

23 career lattices if the program is for a construction trade. Section 2 defines “career
24 lattices” to mean pathways in a program in which an apprentice can either progress
25 upward within a particular occupation or specialize or gain deeper knowledge and
26 experience laterally in particular areas.
