EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to apprenticeships; [prohibiting the issuance of an interim
credential to an apprentice in an apprenticeship program for a
construction trade;] revising the requirements for the eligibility for
registration and approval of a proposed apprenticeship program for a
construction trade; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law makes the Office of the Labor Commissioner responsible and accountable
2 for apprenticeship in this State and requires the Office of the Labor Commissioner to act as
3 the State Apprenticeship Agency for the purposes of certain federal regulations governing
4 apprenticeships. (NRS 607.035) Existing law additionally requires the Labor Commissioner to
5 oversee the State Apprenticeship Council and State Apprenticeship Director and sets forth
6 certain duties the Director must perform under the direction of the Labor Commissioner.
7 (NRS 607.035, 610.120)
8 [Existing federal regulations define “interim credential” to mean, in general, a credential
9 issued by the federal Office of Apprenticeship of the Employment and Training
10 Administration of the United States Department of Labor or a State Apprenticeship Agency,
11 upon request of the appropriate sponsor, as certification of competency attainment by an
12 apprentice. (29 C.F.R. § 29.2) Existing federal regulations set forth certain requirements for
13 apprenticeship programs that choose to issue interim credentials. (29 C.F.R. § 29.5) Section 1
14 of this bill prohibits the Labor Commissioner from issuing or directing the Director to issue an
15 interim credential to an apprentice in an apprenticeship program for a construction trade.]
16 Existing law sets forth various requirements for a proposed apprenticeship program to be
17 eligible for registration and approval by the State Apprenticeship Council. (NRS 610.144)
18 Section 2 of this bill requires a program, if the program provides training in more than one
19 specified construction trade, to contain separate standards for each such trade. [Section 2
20 additionally prohibits a program from containing career lattices if the program is for a
21 construction trade. Section 2 defines “career lattices” to mean pathways in a program in which
22 an apprentice can either progress upward within a particular occupation or specialize or gain
23 deeper knowledge and experience laterally in particular areas.] Section 3 of this bill provides
24 that if a set of standards that does not comply with the provisions of section 2 has been
25 approved for a program before October 1, 2025, the program may continue to use that
26 set of standards until the set of standards is voided or superseded.
