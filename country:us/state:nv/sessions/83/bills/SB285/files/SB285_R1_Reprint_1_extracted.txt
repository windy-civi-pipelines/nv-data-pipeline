SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to apprenticeships.
(BDR 53-91)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.

~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to apprenticeships; revising the requirements for
the eligibility for registration and approval of a proposed
apprenticeship program for a construction trade; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law makes the Office of the Labor Commissioner responsible and
2 accountable for apprenticeship in this State and requires the Office of the Labor
3 Commissioner to act as the State Apprenticeship Agency for the purposes of certain
4 federal regulations governing apprenticeships. (NRS 607.035) Existing law
5 additionally requires the Labor Commissioner to oversee the State Apprenticeship
6 Council and State Apprenticeship Director and sets forth certain duties the Director
7 must perform under the direction of the Labor Commissioner. (NRS 607.035,
8 610.120)
9 Existing law sets forth various requirements for a proposed apprenticeship
10 program to be eligible for registration and approval by the State Apprenticeship
11 Council. (NRS 610.144) Section 2 of this bill requires a program, if the program
12 provides training in more than one specified construction trade, to contain separate
13 standards for each such trade. Section 3 of this bill provides that if a set of
14 standards that does not comply with the provisions of section 2 has been approved
15 for a program before October 1, 2025, the program may continue to use that set of
16 standards until the set of standards is voided or superseded.
