EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; authorizing a patient in any of
certain facilities for assisted living or a resident of a living
community for persons with disabilities or his or her
representative to request the installation and use of an
electronic communication device in the living quarters of
the patient or person; prohibiting such a facility or an
employee of such a facility from taking certain additional
actions; prohibiting a provider of a supported living
services arrangement from taking certain actions with
regard to the installation and use of an electronic
communication device in the home of a recipient of such
services; providing penalties; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes a patient in a facility for skilled nursing or the
2 representative of the patient to request the installation and use of an electronic
3 communication device in the living quarters of the patient. Existing law requires
4 any roommate of the patient to consent before such a device may be installed.
5 However, if the roommate of a patient refuses to consent, existing law requires the
6 facility for skilled nursing to make reasonable attempts to accommodate the patient,
7 including by moving either the patient or the roommate with the consent of the
8 person being moved. (NRS 449A.182) If a facility for skilled nursing approves a
9 request to install an electronic communication device, existing law provides that the
10 patient or the representative of the patient who submitted the request is responsible
11 for choosing the device and paying certain costs associated with the device.

12 (NRS 449A.184) Existing law limits the persons who are authorized to view or
13 listen to the images or sounds which are displayed, broadcast or recorded by an
14 electronic communication device or temporarily disable or turn off an electronic
15 communication device. Existing law also prohibits a facility for skilled nursing
16 from discriminating or retaliating against a patient because of a decision to request
17 the installation and use of an electronic communication device. (NRS 449A.186)
18 Existing law establishes civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against:
19 (1) a facility for skilled nursing which violates that prohibition; (2) a person, other
20 than the patient or the representative of the patient, who obstructs, tampers with or
21 destroys an electronic communication device or any recording made by an
22 electronic communication device; or (3) a person who views or listens to images or
23 sounds which are displayed, broadcast or recorded by an electronic communication
24 device without authorization. (NRS 449A.189, 449A.188) Existing law requires a
25 facility for skilled nursing to post a notice in a conspicuous place at the entrance to
26 the living quarters of a patient which contains an electronic communication device
27 stating that such a device is in that living quarters. Existing law prohibits an
28 employee of a facility for skilled nursing from refusing to enter into the living
29 quarters of a patient which contains an electronic communication device or failing
30 to perform his or her duties because such a device is in use. (NRS 449A.190)
31 Existing law: (1) authorizes the State Board of Health to adopt regulations
32 governing electronic communication devices in facilities for skilled nursing; and
33 (2) provides that the provisions governing such electronic communication devices
34 do not apply to certain devices installed by a law enforcement agency.
35 (NRS 449A.192)
36 Sections 8-14 of this bill broaden the applicability of those provisions to
37 authorize a patient in any facility for assisted living to install an electronic
38 communication device under the same conditions as existing law establishes for a
39 patient in a facility for skilled nursing. Section 3 of this bill defines the term
40 “facility for assisted living” to mean: (1) a facility for intermediate care; (2) a
41 facility for skilled nursing; (3) a home for individual residential care; (4) a unit for
42 the provision of long-term care in a hospital; (5) a residential facility for groups; (6)
43 assisted living services provided in a senior living community; or (7) a secure unit
44 in a medical facility for the provision of care to persons with dementia. Sections 4-
45 6 of this bill define the terms “facility for intermediate care,” “home for individual
46 residential care” and “senior living community,” respectively, to have the meanings
47 ascribed to them in existing law. Section 7 of this bill establishes the applicability
48 of those definitions. Section 1.5 of this bill authorizes the Division of Public and
49 Behavioral Health of the Department of Health and Human Services to deny an
50 application for a license for or suspend or revoke the license of a facility for
51 assisted living that fails to comply with provisions governing the installation and
52 use of electronic communication devices.
53 Sections 24-31 of this bill enact provisions governing the installation of
54 electronic communication devices by residents of living communities for persons
55 with disabilities. Sections 24-30 authorize a resident of such a living community or
56 the representative of the resident to request the installation and use of an electronic
57 communication device in the living quarters of the resident under similar conditions
58 to those that currently apply to a patient in a facility for skilled nursing. Section 24
59 of this bill prescribes the requirements for a person to serve as the representative of
60 a resident. Section 28 establishes civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed
61 against a living community or person who engages in certain prohibited conduct
62 relating to electronic communication devices in living communities. Section 31
63 prohibits a person from posting or otherwise uploading onto an Internet website an
64 image or a sound of an employee or independent contractor of a living community
65 displayed, broadcasted or recorded on an electronic commination device. Section
66 32 prohibits a provider of supported living arrangement services in the home of a
-
*AB368_R1*

– 3 –
67 recipient of such services from: (1) entering into a contract that prohibits the
68 recipient from installing and using an electronic communication device in his or her
69 home; or (2) taking certain actions against a recipient because the recipient has
70 installed or used an electronic communication device in his or her home. Sections
71 19-23 of this bill define certain terms, and section 18 of this bill establishes the
72 applicability of those definitions. Section 30 authorizes the Administrator of the
73 Aging and Disability Services Division of the Department to adopt regulations as
74 necessary to carry out sections 18-32. Section 33 of this bill makes the definition of
75 “supported living arrangement services” applicable to section 18-32. Sections 1,
76 15, 16 and 34-36 of this bill update references to that definition and make other
77 technical updates related to the change made in section 33.
