AN ACT relating to health care; authorizing a patient in [any of] certain facilities
[for assisted living] or a resident of a living community for persons
with disabilities or his or her representative to request the installation
and use of an electronic communication device in the living quarters of
the patient or [person;] the bedroom of the resident; prohibiting such
a facility or living community or an employee of such a facility or
living community from taking certain additional actions; prohibiting a
provider of supported living arrangement services from taking certain
actions with regard to the installation and use of an electronic
communication device in the home of a recipient of such services;
providing penalties; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes a patient in a facility for skilled nursing or the representative of
2 the patient to request the installation and use of an electronic communication device in the
3 living quarters of the patient. Existing law requires any roommate of the patient to consent
4 before such a device may be installed. However, if the roommate of a patient refuses to
5 consent, existing law requires the facility for skilled nursing to make reasonable attempts to
6 accommodate the patient, including by moving either the patient or the roommate with the
7 consent of the person being moved. (NRS 449A.182) If a facility for skilled nursing approves
8 a request to install an electronic communication device, existing law provides that the patient
9 or the representative of the patient who submitted the request is responsible for choosing the
10 device and paying certain costs associated with the device. (NRS 449A.184) Existing law
11 limits the persons who are authorized to view or listen to the images or sounds which are
12 displayed, broadcast or recorded by an electronic communication device or temporarily
13 disable or turn off an electronic communication device. Existing law also prohibits a facility
14 for skilled nursing from discriminating or retaliating against a patient because of a decision to
15 request the installation and use of an electronic communication device. (NRS 449A.186)
16 Existing law establishes civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against: (1) a facility
17 for skilled nursing which violates that prohibition; (2) a person, other than the patient or the

Senate Amendment No. 635 to Assembly Bill No. 368 First Reprint Page 4
18 representative of the patient, who obstructs, tampers with or destroys an electronic
19 communication device or any recording made by an electronic communication device; or (3) a
20 person who views or listens to images or sounds which are displayed, broadcast or recorded
21 by an electronic communication device without authorization. (NRS 449A.189, 449A.188)
22 Existing law requires a facility for skilled nursing to post a notice in a conspicuous place at
23 the entrance to the living quarters of a patient which contains an electronic communication
24 device stating that such a device is in that living quarters. Existing law prohibits an employee
25 of a facility for skilled nursing from refusing to enter into the living quarters of a patient
26 which contains an electronic communication device or failing to perform his or her duties
27 because such a device is in use. (NRS 449A.190) Existing law: (1) authorizes the State Board
28 of Health to adopt regulations governing electronic communication devices in facilities for
29 skilled nursing; and (2) provides that the provisions governing such electronic communication
30 devices do not apply to certain devices installed by a law enforcement agency. (NRS
31 449A.192)
32 Sections 8-14 of this bill broaden the applicability of those provisions to authorize a
33 patient in [any facility for assisted living] certain facilities, referred to as covered facilities,
34 to install an electronic communication device under the same conditions as existing law
35 establishes for a patient in a facility for skilled nursing. Section 3 of this bill defines the term
36 [“facility for assisted living”] “covered facility” to mean: (1) a facility for intermediate care;
37 (2) a facility for skilled nursing; (3) a home for individual residential care; (4) a unit for the
38 provision of long-term care in a hospital; (5) a residential facility for groups; or (6) assisted
39 living services provided in a senior living community . [; or (7) a secure unit in a medical
40 facility for the provision of care to persons with dementia.] Sections 4-6 of this bill define the
41 terms “facility for intermediate care,” “home for individual residential care” and “senior living
42 community,” respectively, to have the meanings ascribed to them in existing law. Section 7 of
43 this bill establishes the applicability of those definitions. Section 1.5 of this bill authorizes the
44 Division of Public and Behavioral Health of the Department of Health and Human Services to
45 deny an application for a license for or suspend or revoke the license of a covered facility [for
46 assisted living] that fails to comply with provisions governing the installation and use of
47 electronic communication devices.
48 Sections 24-31 of this bill enact provisions governing the installation of electronic
49 communication devices by residents of living communities for persons with disabilities.
50 Sections 24-30 authorize a resident of such a living community or the representative of the
51 resident to request the installation and use of an electronic communication device in the
52 [living quarters] bedroom of the resident under similar conditions to those that currently
53 apply to a patient in a facility for skilled nursing. Section 24 of this bill prescribes the
54 requirements for a person to serve as the representative of a resident. Section 28 establishes
55 civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against a living community or person who
56 engages in certain prohibited conduct relating to electronic communication devices in living
57 communities. Section 31 prohibits a person from posting or otherwise uploading onto an
58 Internet website an image or a sound of an employee or independent contractor of a living
59 community displayed, broadcasted or recorded on an electronic commination device. Section
60 32 of this bill prohibits a provider of supported living arrangement services in the home of a
61 recipient of such services from: (1) entering into a contract that prohibits the recipient from
62 installing and using an electronic communication device in his or her home; or (2) taking
63 certain actions against a recipient because the recipient has installed or used an electronic
64 communication device in his or her home. Sections [19-23] 20-23 of this bill define certain
65 terms, and section 18 of this bill establishes the applicability of those definitions. Section 30
66 authorizes the Administrator of the Aging and Disability Services Division of the Department
67 to adopt regulations as necessary to carry out sections 18-32. Section 33 of this bill makes the
68 definition of “supported living arrangement services” applicable to sections 18-32. Sections
69 1, 15, 16 and 34-36 of this bill update references to that definition and make other technical
70 updates related to the change made in section 33.
