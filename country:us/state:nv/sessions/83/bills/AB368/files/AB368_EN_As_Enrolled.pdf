Assembly Bill No. 368–Assemblymember Carter
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to health care; authorizing a patient in certain
facilities or a resident of a living community for persons with
disabilities or his or her representative to request the
installation and use of an electronic communication device in
the living quarters of the patient or the bedroom of the
resident; prohibiting such a facility or living community or an
employee of such a facility or living community from taking
certain additional actions; prohibiting a provider of supported
living arrangement services from taking certain actions with
regard to the installation and use of an electronic
communication device in the home of a recipient of such
services; providing penalties; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law authorizes a patient in a facility for skilled nursing or the
representative of the patient to request the installation and use of an electronic
communication device in the living quarters of the patient. Existing law requires
any roommate of the patient to consent before such a device may be installed.
However, if the roommate of a patient refuses to consent, existing law requires the
facility for skilled nursing to make reasonable attempts to accommodate the patient,
including by moving either the patient or the roommate with the consent of the
person being moved. (NRS 449A.182) If a facility for skilled nursing approves a
request to install an electronic communication device, existing law provides that the
patient or the representative of the patient who submitted the request is responsible
for choosing the device and paying certain costs associated with the device.
(NRS 449A.184) Existing law limits the persons who are authorized to view or
listen to the images or sounds which are displayed, broadcast or recorded by an
electronic communication device or temporarily disable or turn off an electronic
communication device. Existing law also prohibits a facility for skilled nursing
from discriminating or retaliating against a patient because of a decision to request
the installation and use of an electronic communication device. (NRS 449A.186)
Existing law establishes civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against:
(1) a facility for skilled nursing which violates that prohibition; (2) a person, other
than the patient or the representative of the patient, who obstructs, tampers with or
destroys an electronic communication device or any recording made by an
electronic communication device; or (3) a person who views or listens to images or
sounds which are displayed, broadcast or recorded by an electronic communication
device without authorization. (NRS 449A.189, 449A.188) Existing law requires a
facility for skilled nursing to post a notice in a conspicuous place at the entrance to
the living quarters of a patient which contains an electronic communication device
stating that such a device is in that living quarters. Existing law prohibits an
employee of a facility for skilled nursing from refusing to enter into the living
quarters of a patient which contains an electronic communication device or failing
to perform his or her duties because such a device is in use. (NRS 449A.190)
Existing law: (1) authorizes the State Board of Health to adopt regulations
governing electronic communication devices in facilities for skilled nursing; and
(2) provides that the provisions governing such electronic communication devices
-

– 2 –
do not apply to certain devices installed by a law enforcement agency.
(NRS 449A.192)
Sections 8-14 of this bill broaden the applicability of those provisions to
authorize a patient in certain facilities, referred to as covered facilities, to install an
electronic communication device under the same conditions as existing law
establishes for a patient in a facility for skilled nursing. Section 3 of this bill
defines the term “covered facility” to mean: (1) a facility for intermediate care; (2)
a facility for skilled nursing; (3) a home for individual residential care; (4) a unit for
the provision of long-term care in a hospital; (5) a residential facility for groups; or
(6) assisted living services provided in a senior living community. Sections 4-6 of
this bill define the terms “facility for intermediate care,” “home for individual
residential care” and “senior living community,” respectively, to have the meanings
ascribed to them in existing law. Section 7 of this bill establishes the applicability
of those definitions. Section 1.5 of this bill authorizes the Division of Public and
Behavioral Health of the Department of Health and Human Services to deny an
application for a license for or suspend or revoke the license of a covered facility
that fails to comply with provisions governing the installation and use of electronic
communication devices.
Sections 24-31 of this bill enact provisions governing the installation of
electronic communication devices by residents of living communities for persons
with disabilities. Sections 24-30 authorize a resident of such a living community or
the representative of the resident to request the installation and use of an electronic
communication device in the bedroom of the resident under similar conditions to
those that currently apply to a patient in a facility for skilled nursing. Section 24 of
this bill prescribes the requirements for a person to serve as the representative of a
resident. Section 28 establishes civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed
against a living community or person who engages in certain prohibited conduct
relating to electronic communication devices in living communities. Section 31
prohibits a person from posting or otherwise uploading onto an Internet website an
image or a sound of an employee or independent contractor of a living community
displayed, broadcasted or recorded on an electronic commination device. Section
32 of this bill prohibits a provider of supported living arrangement services in the
home of a recipient of such services from: (1) entering into a contract that prohibits
the recipient from installing and using an electronic communication device in his or
her home; or (2) taking certain actions against a recipient because the recipient has
installed or used an electronic communication device in his or her home. Sections
20-23 of this bill define certain terms, and section 18 of this bill establishes the
applicability of those definitions. Section 30 authorizes the Administrator of the
Aging and Disability Services Division of the Department to adopt regulations as
necessary to carry out sections 18-32. Section 33 of this bill makes the definition of
“supported living arrangement services” applicable to sections 18-32. Sections 1,
15, 16 and 34-36 of this bill update references to that definition and make other
technical updates related to the change made in section 33.
