EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; authorizing a patient in any of
certain facilities for assisted living or his or her
representative to request the installation and use of an
electronic communication device in the living quarters of
the patient; prohibiting such a facility or an employee of
such a facility from taking certain additional actions;
providing penalties; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes a patient in a facility for skilled nursing or the
2 representative of the patient to request the installation and use of an electronic
3 communication device in the living quarters of the patient. Existing law requires
4 any roommate of the patient to consent before such a device may be installed.
5 However, if the roommate of a patient refuses to consent, existing law requires the
6 facility for skilled nursing to make reasonable attempts to accommodate the patient,
7 including by moving either the patient or the roommate with the consent of the
8 person being moved. (NRS 449A.182) If a facility for skilled nursing approves a
9 request to install an electronic communication device, existing law provides that the
10 patient or the representative of the patient who submitted the request is responsible
11 for choosing the device and paying certain costs associated with the device. (NRS
12 449A.184) Existing law limits the persons who are authorized to view or listen to
13 the images or sounds which are displayed, broadcast or recorded by an electronic
14 communication device or temporarily disable or turn off an electronic
15 communication device. Existing law also prohibits a facility for skilled nursing
16 from discriminating or retaliating against a patient because of a decision to request
17 the installation and use of an electronic communication device. (NRS 449A.186)
-

– 2 –
18 Existing law establishes civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against:
19 (1) a facility for skilled nursing which violates that prohibition; (2) a person, other
20 than the patient or the representative of the patient, who obstructs, tampers with or
21 destroys an electronic communication device or any recording made by an
22 electronic communication device; or (3) a person who views or listens to images or
23 sounds which are displayed, broadcast or recorded by an electronic communication
24 device without authorization. (NRS 449A.189, 449A.188) Existing law requires a
25 facility for skilled nursing to post a notice in a conspicuous place at the entrance to
26 the living quarters of a patient which contains an electronic communication device
27 stating that such a device is in that living quarters. Existing law prohibits an
28 employee of a facility for skilled nursing from refusing to enter into the living
29 quarters of a patient which contains an electronic communication device or failing
30 to perform his or her duties because such a device is in use. (NRS 449A.190)
31 Existing law: (1) authorizes the State Board of Health to adopt regulations
32 governing electronic communication devices in facilities for skilled nursing; and
33 (2) provides that the provisions governing such electronic communication devices
34 do not apply to certain devices installed by a law enforcement agency.
35 (NRS 449A.192)
36 Sections 8-14 of this bill broaden the applicability of those provisions to
37 authorize a patient in any facility for assisted living to install an electronic
38 communication device under the same conditions as existing law establishes for a
39 patient in a facility for skilled nursing. Section 3 of this bill defines the term
40 “facility for assisted living” to mean: (1) a facility for intermediate care; (2) a
41 facility for skilled nursing; (3) a home for individual residential care; (4) a unit for
42 the provision of long-term care in a hospital; (5) a residential facility for groups; (6)
43 assisted living services provided in a senior living community; or (7) a secure unit
44 in a medical facility for the provision of care to persons with dementia. Sections 4-
45 6 of this bill define the terms “facility for intermediate care,” “home for individual
46 residential care” and “senior living community,” respectively, to have the meanings
47 ascribed to them in existing law. Section 7 of this bill establishes the applicability
48 of those definitions. Section 1 of this bill authorizes the Division of Public and
49 Behavioral Health of the Department of Health and Human Services to deny an
50 application for a license for or suspend or revoke the license of a facility for
51 assisted living that fails to comply with provisions governing the installation and
52 use of electronic communication devices.
