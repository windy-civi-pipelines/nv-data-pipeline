AN ACT relating to health care; authorizing a patient in any of certain facilities for
assisted living or a resident of a living community for persons with
disabilities or his or her representative to request the installation and
use of an electronic communication device in the living quarters of the
patient [;] or person; prohibiting such a facility or an employee of
such a facility from taking certain additional actions; prohibiting a
provider of a supported living services arrangement from taking
certain actions with regard to the installation and use of an
electronic communication device in the home of a recipient of such
services; providing penalties; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes a patient in a facility for skilled nursing or the representative of
2 the patient to request the installation and use of an electronic communication device in the
3 living quarters of the patient. Existing law requires any roommate of the patient to consent
4 before such a device may be installed. However, if the roommate of a patient refuses to
5 consent, existing law requires the facility for skilled nursing to make reasonable attempts to
6 accommodate the patient, including by moving either the patient or the roommate with the
7 consent of the person being moved. (NRS 449A.182) If a facility for skilled nursing approves
8 a request to install an electronic communication device, existing law provides that the patient
9 or the representative of the patient who submitted the request is responsible for choosing the
10 device and paying certain costs associated with the device. (NRS 449A.184) Existing law
11 limits the persons who are authorized to view or listen to the images or sounds which are
12 displayed, broadcast or recorded by an electronic communication device or temporarily
13 disable or turn off an electronic communication device. Existing law also prohibits a facility
14 for skilled nursing from discriminating or retaliating against a patient because of a decision to
15 request the installation and use of an electronic communication device. (NRS 449A.186)
16 Existing law establishes civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against: (1) a facility
17 for skilled nursing which violates that prohibition; (2) a person, other than the patient or the

Assembly Amendment No. 447 to Assembly Bill No. 368 Page 4
18 representative of the patient, who obstructs, tampers with or destroys an electronic
19 communication device or any recording made by an electronic communication device; or (3) a
20 person who views or listens to images or sounds which are displayed, broadcast or recorded
21 by an electronic communication device without authorization. (NRS 449A.189, 449A.188)
22 Existing law requires a facility for skilled nursing to post a notice in a conspicuous place at
23 the entrance to the living quarters of a patient which contains an electronic communication
24 device stating that such a device is in that living quarters. Existing law prohibits an employee
25 of a facility for skilled nursing from refusing to enter into the living quarters of a patient
26 which contains an electronic communication device or failing to perform his or her duties
27 because such a device is in use. (NRS 449A.190) Existing law: (1) authorizes the State Board
28 of Health to adopt regulations governing electronic communication devices in facilities for
29 skilled nursing; and (2) provides that the provisions governing such electronic communication
30 devices do not apply to certain devices installed by a law enforcement agency. (NRS
31 449A.192)
32 Sections 8-14 of this bill broaden the applicability of those provisions to authorize a
33 patient in any facility for assisted living to install an electronic communication device under
34 the same conditions as existing law establishes for a patient in a facility for skilled nursing.
35 Section 3 of this bill defines the term “facility for assisted living” to mean: (1) a facility for
36 intermediate care; (2) a facility for skilled nursing; (3) a home for individual residential care;
37 (4) a unit for the provision of long-term care in a hospital; (5) a residential facility for groups;
38 (6) assisted living services provided in a senior living community; or (7) a secure unit in a
39 medical facility for the provision of care to persons with dementia. Sections 4-6 of this bill
40 define the terms “facility for intermediate care,” “home for individual residential care” and
41 “senior living community,” respectively, to have the meanings ascribed to them in existing
42 law. Section 7 of this bill establishes the applicability of those definitions. Section [1] 1.5 of
43 this bill authorizes the Division of Public and Behavioral Health of the Department of Health
44 and Human Services to deny an application for a license for or suspend or revoke the license
45 of a facility for assisted living that fails to comply with provisions governing the installation
46 and use of electronic communication devices.
47 Sections 24-31 of this bill enact provisions governing the installation of electronic
48 communication devices by residents of living communities for persons with disabilities.
49 Sections 24-30 authorize a resident of such a living community or the representative of
50 the resident to request the installation and use of an electronic communication device in
51 the living quarters of the resident under similar conditions to those that currently apply
52 to a patient in a facility for skilled nursing. Section 24 of this bill prescribes the
53 requirements for a person to serve as the representative of a resident. Section 28
54 establishes civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against a living community
55 or person who engages in certain prohibited conduct relating to electronic
56 communication devices in living communities. Section 31 prohibits a person from
57 posting or otherwise uploading onto an Internet website an image or a sound of an
58 employee or independent contractor of a living community displayed, broadcasted or
59 recorded on an electronic commination device. Section 32 prohibits a provider of
60 supported living arrangement services in the home of a recipient of such services from:
61 (1) entering into a contract that prohibits the recipient from installing and using an
62 electronic communication device in his or her home; or (2) taking certain actions against
63 a recipient because the recipient has installed or used an electronic communication
64 device in his or her home. Sections 19-23 of this bill define certain terms, and section 18
65 of this bill establishes the applicability of those definitions. Section 30 authorizes the
66 Administrator of the Aging and Disability Services Division of the Department to adopt
67 regulations as necessary to carry out sections 18-32. Section 33 of this bill makes the
68 definition of “supported living arrangement services” applicable to section 18-32.
69 Sections 1, 15, 16 and 34-36 of this bill update references to that definition and make
70 other technical updates related to the change made in section 33.
