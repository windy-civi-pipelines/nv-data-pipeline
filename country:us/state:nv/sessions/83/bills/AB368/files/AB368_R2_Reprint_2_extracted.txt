EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; authorizing a patient in certain
facilities or a resident of a living community for persons
with disabilities or his or her representative to request the
installation and use of an electronic communication
device in the living quarters of the patient or the bedroom
of the resident; prohibiting such a facility or living
community or an employee of such a facility or living
community from taking certain additional actions;
prohibiting a provider of supported living arrangement
services from taking certain actions with regard to the
installation and use of an electronic communication
device in the home of a recipient of such services;
providing penalties; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes a patient in a facility for skilled nursing or the
2 representative of the patient to request the installation and use of an electronic
3 communication device in the living quarters of the patient. Existing law requires
4 any roommate of the patient to consent before such a device may be installed.
5 However, if the roommate of a patient refuses to consent, existing law requires the
6 facility for skilled nursing to make reasonable attempts to accommodate the patient,
7 including by moving either the patient or the roommate with the consent of the
8 person being moved. (NRS 449A.182) If a facility for skilled nursing approves a
9 request to install an electronic communication device, existing law provides that the
10 patient or the representative of the patient who submitted the request is responsible
-
*AB368_R2*
– 2 –
11 for choosing the device and paying certain costs associated with the device.
12 (NRS 449A.184) Existing law limits the persons who are authorized to view or
13 listen to the images or sounds which are displayed, broadcast or recorded by an
14 electronic communication device or temporarily disable or turn off an electronic
15 communication device. Existing law also prohibits a facility for skilled nursing
16 from discriminating or retaliating against a patient because of a decision to request
17 the installation and use of an electronic communication device. (NRS 449A.186)
18 Existing law establishes civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against:
19 (1) a facility for skilled nursing which violates that prohibition; (2) a person, other
20 than the patient or the representative of the patient, who obstructs, tampers with or
21 destroys an electronic communication device or any recording made by an
22 electronic communication device; or (3) a person who views or listens to images or
23 sounds which are displayed, broadcast or recorded by an electronic communication
24 device without authorization. (NRS 449A.189, 449A.188) Existing law requires a
25 facility for skilled nursing to post a notice in a conspicuous place at the entrance to
26 the living quarters of a patient which contains an electronic communication device
27 stating that such a device is in that living quarters. Existing law prohibits an
28 employee of a facility for skilled nursing from refusing to enter into the living
29 quarters of a patient which contains an electronic communication device or failing
30 to perform his or her duties because such a device is in use. (NRS 449A.190)
31 Existing law: (1) authorizes the State Board of Health to adopt regulations
32 governing electronic communication devices in facilities for skilled nursing; and
33 (2) provides that the provisions governing such electronic communication devices
34 do not apply to certain devices installed by a law enforcement agency.
35 (NRS 449A.192)
36 Sections 8-14 of this bill broaden the applicability of those provisions to
37 authorize a patient in certain facilities, referred to as covered facilities, to install an
38 electronic communication device under the same conditions as existing law
39 establishes for a patient in a facility for skilled nursing. Section 3 of this bill
40 defines the term “covered facility” to mean: (1) a facility for intermediate care; (2)
41 a facility for skilled nursing; (3) a home for individual residential care; (4) a unit for
42 the provision of long-term care in a hospital; (5) a residential facility for groups; or
43 (6) assisted living services provided in a senior living community. Sections 4-6 of
44 this bill define the terms “facility for intermediate care,” “home for individual
45 residential care” and “senior living community,” respectively, to have the meanings
46 ascribed to them in existing law. Section 7 of this bill establishes the applicability
47 of those definitions. Section 1.5 of this bill authorizes the Division of Public and
48 Behavioral Health of the Department of Health and Human Services to deny an
49 application for a license for or suspend or revoke the license of a covered facility
50 that fails to comply with provisions governing the installation and use of electronic
51 communication devices.
52 Sections 24-31 of this bill enact provisions governing the installation of
53 electronic communication devices by residents of living communities for persons
54 with disabilities. Sections 24-30 authorize a resident of such a living community or
55 the representative of the resident to request the installation and use of an electronic
56 communication device in the bedroom of the resident under similar conditions to
57 those that currently apply to a patient in a facility for skilled nursing. Section 24 of
58 this bill prescribes the requirements for a person to serve as the representative of a
59 resident. Section 28 establishes civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed
60 against a living community or person who engages in certain prohibited conduct
61 relating to electronic communication devices in living communities. Section 31
62 prohibits a person from posting or otherwise uploading onto an Internet website an
63 image or a sound of an employee or independent contractor of a living community
64 displayed, broadcasted or recorded on an electronic commination device. Section
65 32 of this bill prohibits a provider of supported living arrangement services in the
-
*AB368_R2*
– 3 –
66 home of a recipient of such services from: (1) entering into a contract that prohibits
67 the recipient from installing and using an electronic communication device in his or
68 her home; or (2) taking certain actions against a recipient because the recipient has
69 installed or used an electronic communication device in his or her home. Sections
70 20-23 of this bill define certain terms, and section 18 of this bill establishes the
71 applicability of those definitions. Section 30 authorizes the Administrator of the
72 Aging and Disability Services Division of the Department to adopt regulations as
73 necessary to carry out sections 18-32. Section 33 of this bill makes the definition of
74 “supported living arrangement services” applicable to sections 18-32. Sections 1,
75 15, 16 and 34-36 of this bill update references to that definition and make other
76 technical updates related to the change made in section 33.

SECOND REPRINT A.B. 368
ASSEMBLY BILL NO. 368–ASSEMBLYMEMBER CARTER
MARCH 6, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Health and Human Services
SUMMARY—Revises provisions governing electronic
communication devices in locations where certain
services are provided. (BDR 40-878)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: Increases or Newly
Provides for Term of Imprisonment in County or City
Jail or Detention Facility.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; authorizing a patient in certain
facilities or a resident of a living community for persons
with disabilities or his or her representative to request the
installation and use of an electronic communication
device in the living quarters of the patient or the bedroom
of the resident; prohibiting such a facility or living
community or an employee of such a facility or living
community from taking certain additional actions;
prohibiting a provider of supported living arrangement
services from taking certain actions with regard to the
installation and use of an electronic communication
device in the home of a recipient of such services;
providing penalties; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes a patient in a facility for skilled nursing or the
2 representative of the patient to request the installation and use of an electronic
3 communication device in the living quarters of the patient. Existing law requires
4 any roommate of the patient to consent before such a device may be installed.
5 However, if the roommate of a patient refuses to consent, existing law requires the
6 facility for skilled nursing to make reasonable attempts to accommodate the patient,
7 including by moving either the patient or the roommate with the consent of the
8 person being moved. (NRS 449A.182) If a facility for skilled nursing approves a
9 request to install an electronic communication device, existing law provides that the
10 patient or the representative of the patient who submitted the request is responsible
-
*AB368_R2*

– 2 –
11 for choosing the device and paying certain costs associated with the device.
12 (NRS 449A.184) Existing law limits the persons who are authorized to view or
13 listen to the images or sounds which are displayed, broadcast or recorded by an
14 electronic communication device or temporarily disable or turn off an electronic
15 communication device. Existing law also prohibits a facility for skilled nursing
16 from discriminating or retaliating against a patient because of a decision to request
17 the installation and use of an electronic communication device. (NRS 449A.186)
18 Existing law establishes civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against:
19 (1) a facility for skilled nursing which violates that prohibition; (2) a person, other
20 than the patient or the representative of the patient, who obstructs, tampers with or
21 destroys an electronic communication device or any recording made by an
22 electronic communication device; or (3) a person who views or listens to images or
23 sounds which are displayed, broadcast or recorded by an electronic communication
24 device without authorization. (NRS 449A.189, 449A.188) Existing law requires a
25 facility for skilled nursing to post a notice in a conspicuous place at the entrance to
26 the living quarters of a patient which contains an electronic communication device
27 stating that such a device is in that living quarters. Existing law prohibits an
28 employee of a facility for skilled nursing from refusing to enter into the living
29 quarters of a patient which contains an electronic communication device or failing
30 to perform his or her duties because such a device is in use. (NRS 449A.190)
31 Existing law: (1) authorizes the State Board of Health to adopt regulations
32 governing electronic communication devices in facilities for skilled nursing; and
33 (2) provides that the provisions governing such electronic communication devices
34 do not apply to certain devices installed by a law enforcement agency.
35 (NRS 449A.192)
36 Sections 8-14 of this bill broaden the applicability of those provisions to
37 authorize a patient in certain facilities, referred to as covered facilities, to install an
38 electronic communication device under the same conditions as existing law
39 establishes for a patient in a facility for skilled nursing. Section 3 of this bill
40 defines the term “covered facility” to mean: (1) a facility for intermediate care; (2)
41 a facility for skilled nursing; (3) a home for individual residential care; (4) a unit for
42 the provision of long-term care in a hospital; (5) a residential facility for groups; or
43 (6) assisted living services provided in a senior living community. Sections 4-6 of
44 this bill define the terms “facility for intermediate care,” “home for individual
45 residential care” and “senior living community,” respectively, to have the meanings
46 ascribed to them in existing law. Section 7 of this bill establishes the applicability
47 of those definitions. Section 1.5 of this bill authorizes the Division of Public and
48 Behavioral Health of the Department of Health and Human Services to deny an
49 application for a license for or suspend or revoke the license of a covered facility
50 that fails to comply with provisions governing the installation and use of electronic
51 communication devices.
52 Sections 24-31 of this bill enact provisions governing the installation of
53 electronic communication devices by residents of living communities for persons
54 with disabilities. Sections 24-30 authorize a resident of such a living community or
55 the representative of the resident to request the installation and use of an electronic
56 communication device in the bedroom of the resident under similar conditions to
57 those that currently apply to a patient in a facility for skilled nursing. Section 24 of
58 this bill prescribes the requirements for a person to serve as the representative of a
59 resident. Section 28 establishes civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed
60 against a living community or person who engages in certain prohibited conduct
61 relating to electronic communication devices in living communities. Section 31
62 prohibits a person from posting or otherwise uploading onto an Internet website an
63 image or a sound of an employee or independent contractor of a living community
64 displayed, broadcasted or recorded on an electronic commination device. Section
65 32 of this bill prohibits a provider of supported living arrangement services in the
-
*AB368_R2*

– 3 –
66 home of a recipient of such services from: (1) entering into a contract that prohibits
67 the recipient from installing and using an electronic communication device in his or
68 her home; or (2) taking certain actions against a recipient because the recipient has
69 installed or used an electronic communication device in his or her home. Sections
70 20-23 of this bill define certain terms, and section 18 of this bill establishes the
71 applicability of those definitions. Section 30 authorizes the Administrator of the
72 Aging and Disability Services Division of the Department to adopt regulations as
73 necessary to carry out sections 18-32. Section 33 of this bill makes the definition of
74 “supported living arrangement services” applicable to sections 18-32. Sections 1,
75 15, 16 and 34-36 of this bill update references to that definition and make other
76 technical updates related to the change made in section 33.
