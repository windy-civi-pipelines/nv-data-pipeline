Senate Bill No. 130–Senators Doñate,
Flores and Steinbeck
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to contractors; providing for issuance by the State
Contractors’ Board of a restricted license; setting forth
various requirements relating to restricted licenses; requiring
the Board to adopt regulations governing restricted licenses;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of contractors by the
State Contractors’ Board. (Chapter 624 of NRS) Section 2 of this bill authorizes the
Board to issue a restricted license that authorizes a person to perform certain work
of a type for which a contractor’s license is required, within the scope and monetary
limit of the restricted license, to a person who satisfies certain requirements, which
include, without limitation, the requirement to have obtained certain experience
and, within the year immediately preceding the application, to have completed a
course in business counseling or a similar curriculum.
Existing regulations establish a classification B license in the branch of general
building and the subclassification B-7, which authorizes a person who holds such a
license to perform the remodeling and improvement of an existing, detached, stand-
alone single-family residence or single-family residential unit within a structure
that does not extend more than three stories above the ground and one story below
the ground. (NAC 624.160, 624.170) Existing regulations provide that a
subclassification B-7 license does not authorize a person to increase the existing
enclosed space of the residential structure. (NAC 624.170) Section 2 provides that
a restricted license may only be issued in a classification or subclassification which
authorizes the holder to perform the type of work for which the holder of a
subclassification B-7 license is authorized to perform under existing regulations.
Section 2 additionally authorizes the holder of a restricted license to enter into a
contract for a construction project that involves one or more building trades or
crafts, subject to certain limitations.
Section 2 sets forth certain bonding requirements for applicants for a restricted
license and authorizes a person who has held such a license for not less than 2 years
to apply for a contractor’s license that is not a restricted license under certain
circumstances. Under section 2, the requirements generally applicable to the
issuance and renewal of a contractor’s license do not apply to the issuance and
renewal of a restricted license, with certain exceptions. Rather, sections 2 and 3 of
this bill require the Board, on or before January 1, 2027, to adopt regulations
necessary to provide for the issuance and renewal of a restricted license. The
regulations are required to, among other things: (1) establish the monetary limit of a
restricted license, which must be $7,000, including labor and materials, or a greater
amount that the Board determines to be appropriate; (2) set forth certain application
requirements and procedures for the issuance and renewal of a restricted license;
and (3) establish reasonable fees associated with the issuance and renewal of a
restricted license.
