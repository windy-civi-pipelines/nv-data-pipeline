AN ACT relating to contractors; providing for issuance by the State
Contractors’ Board of a restricted license; setting forth
various requirements relating to restricted licenses;
requiring the Board to adopt regulations governing
restricted licenses; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of contractors by the
2 State Contractors’ Board. (Chapter 624 of NRS) Section 2 of this bill authorizes the
3 Board to issue a restricted license that authorizes a person to perform certain work
4 of a type for which a contractor’s license is required, within the scope and monetary
5 limit of the restricted license, to a person who satisfies certain requirements, which
6 include, without limitation, the requirement to have obtained certain experience
7 and, within the year immediately preceding the application, to have completed a
8 course in business counseling or a similar curriculum.
9 Existing regulations establish a classification B license in the branch of general
10 building and the subclassification B-7, which authorizes a person who holds such a
11 license to perform the remodeling and improvement of an existing, detached, stand-
12 alone single-family residence or single-family residential unit within a structure
13 that does not extend more than three stories above the ground and one story below
14 the ground. (NAC 624.160, 624.170) Existing regulations provide that a
15 subclassification B-7 license does not authorize a person to increase the existing
16 enclosed space of the residential structure. (NAC 624.170) Section 2 provides that
17 a restricted license may only be issued in a classification or subclassification which
18 authorizes the holder to perform the type of work for which the holder of a
19 subclassification B-7 license is authorized to perform under existing regulations.
20 Section 2 additionally authorizes the holder of a restricted license to enter into a
21 contract for a construction project that involves one or more building trades or
22 crafts, subject to certain limitations.

23 Section 2 sets forth certain bonding requirements for applicants for a restricted
24 license and authorizes a person who has held such a license for not less than 2 years
25 to apply for a contractor’s license that is not a restricted license under certain
26 circumstances. Under section 2, the requirements generally applicable to the
27 issuance and renewal of a contractor’s license do not apply to the issuance and
28 renewal of a restricted license, with certain exceptions. Rather, sections 2 and 3 of
29 this bill require the Board, on or before January 1, 2027, to adopt regulations
30 necessary to provide for the issuance and renewal of a restricted license. The
31 regulations are required to, among other things: (1) establish the monetary limit of a
32 restricted license, which must be $7,000, including labor and materials, or a greater
33 amount that the Board determines to be appropriate; (2) set forth certain application
34 requirements and procedures for the issuance and renewal of a restricted license;
35 and (3) establish reasonable fees associated with the issuance and renewal of a
36 restricted license.
