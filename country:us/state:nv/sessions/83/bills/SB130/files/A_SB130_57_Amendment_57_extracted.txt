restricted license [in the applicable classification or subclassification;]
; setting forth various requirements relating to restricted licenses;
requiring the Board to adopt regulations governing restricted
licenses; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of contractors by the State
2 Contractors’ Board. (Chapter 624 of NRS) Section 2 of this bill authorizes [a licensed
3 contractor] the Board to issue a restricted license that authorizes a person to perform
4 certain work of a type for which [the contractor does not have] a contractor’s license [in the
5 applicable classification or subclassification if: (1) the value of the work is less than $1,000,
6 including labor and materials; (2) the work does not require a permit; and (3) the work is not

10 the Board and, within the year immediately preceding the application, to have completed
11 a course in business counseling or a similar curriculum. Section 2 sets forth certain
12 bonding requirements for applicants for a restricted license and authorizes a person who
13 has held such a license for not less than 2 years to apply for a contractor’s license that is

15 generally applicable to the issuance and renewal of a contractor’s license do not apply to

17 2 and 3 of this bill require the Board, on or before January 1, 2027, to adopt regulations
18 necessary to provide for the issuance and renewal of a restricted license. The regulations
19 are required to, among other things: (1) set forth the type of work in which the holder of
20 a restricted license may engage, which must not be of a type performed by a plumbing,
21 electrical, refrigeration or air-conditioning contractor [. (NRS 624.220) This bill increases the
22 value of work that a licensed contractor may perform for which the contractor does not have a
23 license in the applicable classification or subclassification from less than $1,000 to less than
24 $2,500.] ; and (2) the monetary limit of a restricted license, which must be $7,000,

25 including labor and materials, or such greater amount that the Board determines to be
26 appropriate.
