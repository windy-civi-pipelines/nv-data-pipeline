AN ACT relating to contractors; providing for issuance by the State
Contractors’ Board of a restricted license; setting forth
various requirements relating to restricted licenses;
requiring the Board to adopt regulations governing
restricted licenses; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of contractors by the
2 State Contractors’ Board. (Chapter 624 of NRS) Section 2 of this bill authorizes the
3 Board to issue a restricted license that authorizes a person to perform certain work
4 of a type for which a contractor’s license is required, within the scope and monetary
5 limit of the restricted license, to a person who satisfies certain requirements, which
6 include, without limitation, the requirement to have obtained certain experience, to
7 have passed an entry-level examination required by the Board and, within the year
8 immediately preceding the application, to have completed a course in business
9 counseling or a similar curriculum. Section 2 sets forth certain bonding
10 requirements for applicants for a restricted license and authorizes a person who has
11 held such a license for not less than 2 years to apply for a contractor’s license that is
12 not a restricted license under certain circumstances. Under section 2, the
13 requirements generally applicable to the issuance and renewal of a contractor’s
14 license do not apply to the issuance and renewal of a restricted license, with certain
15 exceptions. Rather, sections 2 and 3 of this bill require the Board, on or before
16 January 1, 2027, to adopt regulations necessary to provide for the issuance and
17 renewal of a restricted license. The regulations are required to, among other things:
18 (1) set forth the type of work in which the holder of a restricted license may engage,
19 which must not be of a type performed by a plumbing, electrical, refrigeration or
20 air-conditioning contractor; and (2) the monetary limit of a restricted license, which
-

21 must be $7,000, including labor and materials, or such greater amount that the
22 Board determines to be appropriate.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. (Deleted by amendment.)
2 Sec. 2. Chapter 624 of NRS is hereby amended by adding
3 thereto a new section to read as follows:
