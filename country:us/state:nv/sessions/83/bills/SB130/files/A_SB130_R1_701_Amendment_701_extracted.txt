EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to contractors; providing for issuance by the State Contractors’
Board of a restricted license; setting forth various requirements relating
to restricted licenses; requiring the Board to adopt regulations
governing restricted licenses; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of contractors by the State
2 Contractors’ Board. (Chapter 624 of NRS) Section 2 of this bill authorizes the Board to issue
3 a restricted license that authorizes a person to perform certain work of a type for which a
4 contractor’s license is required, within the scope and monetary limit of the restricted license,
5 to a person who satisfies certain requirements, which include, without limitation, the
6 requirement to have obtained certain experience [, to have passed an entry-level examination
7 required by the Board] and, within the year immediately preceding the application, to have
8 completed a course in business counseling or a similar curriculum.
9 Existing regulations establish a classification B license in the branch of general
10 building and the subclassification B-7, which authorizes a person who holds such a
11 license to perform the remodeling and improvement of an existing, detached, stand-
12 alone single-family residence or single-family residential unit within a structure that
13 does not extend more than three stories above the ground and one story below the
14 ground. (NAC 624.160, 624.170) Existing regulations provide that a subclassification B-7
15 license does not authorize a person to increase the existing enclosed space of the
16 residential structure. (NAC 624.170) Section 2 provides that a restricted license may only
17 be issued in a classification or subclassification which authorizes the holder to perform
18 the type of work for which the holder of a subclassification B-7 license is authorized to
19 perform under existing regulations. Section 2 additionally authorizes the holder of a
20 restricted license to enter into a contract for a construction project that involves one or
21 more building trades or crafts, subject to certain limitations.
22 Section 2 sets forth certain bonding requirements for applicants for a restricted license
23 and authorizes a person who has held such a license for not less than 2 years to apply for a
24 contractor’s license that is not a restricted license under certain circumstances. Under section
25 2, the requirements generally applicable to the issuance and renewal of a contractor’s license
26 do not apply to the issuance and renewal of a restricted license, with certain exceptions.
27 Rather, sections 2 and 3 of this bill require the Board, on or before January 1, 2027, to adopt
Assembly Amendment No. 701 to Senate Bill No. 130 First Reprint Page 4
28 regulations necessary to provide for the issuance and renewal of a restricted license. The
29 regulations are required to, among other things: (1) [set forth the type of work in which the
30 holder of a restricted license may engage, which must not be of a type performed by a
31 plumbing, electrical, refrigeration or air-conditioning contractor; and (2)] establish the
32 monetary limit of a restricted license, which must be $7,000, including labor and materials, or
33 [such] a greater amount that the Board determines to be appropriate [.] ; (2) set forth certain
34 application requirements and procedures for the issuance and renewal of a restricted
35 license; and (3) establish reasonable fees associated with the issuance and renewal of a
36 restricted license.

35 this chapter and the regulations adopted pursuant thereto governing the issuance
36 of a contractor’s license that is not a restricted license, apply for a contractor’s

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to contractors; providing for issuance by the State Contractors’
Board of a restricted license; setting forth various requirements relating
to restricted licenses; requiring the Board to adopt regulations
governing restricted licenses; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of contractors by the State
2 Contractors’ Board. (Chapter 624 of NRS) Section 2 of this bill authorizes the Board to issue
3 a restricted license that authorizes a person to perform certain work of a type for which a
4 contractor’s license is required, within the scope and monetary limit of the restricted license,
5 to a person who satisfies certain requirements, which include, without limitation, the
6 requirement to have obtained certain experience [, to have passed an entry-level examination
7 required by the Board] and, within the year immediately preceding the application, to have
8 completed a course in business counseling or a similar curriculum.
9 Existing regulations establish a classification B license in the branch of general
10 building and the subclassification B-7, which authorizes a person who holds such a
11 license to perform the remodeling and improvement of an existing, detached, stand-
12 alone single-family residence or single-family residential unit within a structure that
13 does not extend more than three stories above the ground and one story below the
14 ground. (NAC 624.160, 624.170) Existing regulations provide that a subclassification B-7
15 license does not authorize a person to increase the existing enclosed space of the
16 residential structure. (NAC 624.170) Section 2 provides that a restricted license may only
17 be issued in a classification or subclassification which authorizes the holder to perform
18 the type of work for which the holder of a subclassification B-7 license is authorized to
19 perform under existing regulations. Section 2 additionally authorizes the holder of a
20 restricted license to enter into a contract for a construction project that involves one or
21 more building trades or crafts, subject to certain limitations.
22 Section 2 sets forth certain bonding requirements for applicants for a restricted license
23 and authorizes a person who has held such a license for not less than 2 years to apply for a
24 contractor’s license that is not a restricted license under certain circumstances. Under section
25 2, the requirements generally applicable to the issuance and renewal of a contractor’s license
26 do not apply to the issuance and renewal of a restricted license, with certain exceptions.
27 Rather, sections 2 and 3 of this bill require the Board, on or before January 1, 2027, to adopt

28 regulations necessary to provide for the issuance and renewal of a restricted license. The
