Senate Bill No. 278–Senators Cruz-Crawford, Ohrenschall; Doñate,
Flores and Nguyen
Joint Sponsors: Assemblymembers
González and Torres-Fossett
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to education; requiring the Commission on
Professional Standards in Education to consider certain
changes when adopting regulations governing licensure for
teachers and other educational personnel; eliminating the use
of local assessments to determine whether a pupil has a
deficiency in the subject area of reading for certain purposes;
revising certain reporting requirements concerning pupils
who receive certain services and instruction to address a
deficiency in the subject area of reading; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law creates the Commission on Professional Standards in Education
and requires the Commission to adopt regulations prescribing the qualifications for
licensing teachers and other educational personnel. (NRS 391.011, 391.019)
Section 1.1 of this bill requires the Commission to consider any changes necessary
to improve access to licensure or endorsement when adopting such regulations.
Existing law requires a public elementary school to provide certain programs,
services and instruction to certain pupils who have a deficiency in the subject area
of reading based on state or local assessments and other relevant information. (NRS
392.750, 392.755) Sections 2.6 and 3 of this bill eliminate the use of local
assessments to determine whether a pupil has a deficiency in the subject area of
reading. Section 3 further provides that a pupil is not required to continue receiving
services or instruction to correct a deficiency in the subject area of reading if the
pupil achieves a score on the statewide assessment that falls within the level
established by the State Board of Education for the grade level in which the pupil is
enrolled.
Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district and the
governing body of a charter school to prepare a report containing certain
information regarding pupils who receive intervention services and intensive
instruction to address a deficiency in the subject area of reading. (NRS 388A.487,
392.775) Sections 1 and 3.5 of this bill eliminate this requirement. Section 2.2 of
this bill prohibits any entity other than the State Board of Education from requiring
a public school, the board of trustees of a school district or the governing body of a
charter school to report information concerning pupils who receive intervention
services and intensive instruction to address a deficiency in the subject area of
reading. Section 2.4 of this bill applies the existing definition of “subject area of
reading” to the provisions of section 2.2.
