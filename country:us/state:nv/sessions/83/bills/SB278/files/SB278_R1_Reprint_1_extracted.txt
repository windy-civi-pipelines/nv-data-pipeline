SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to education.
(BDR 34-788)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; requiring the Commission on
Professional Standards in Education to consider certain
changes when adopting regulations governing licensure
for teachers and other educational personnel; eliminating
the use of local assessments to determine whether a pupil
has a deficiency in the subject area of reading for certain
purposes; revising certain reporting requirements
concerning pupils who receive certain services and
instruction to address a deficiency in the subject area of
reading; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates the Commission on Professional Standards in Education
2 and requires the Commission to adopt regulations prescribing the qualifications for
3 licensing teachers and other educational personnel. (NRS 391.011, 391.019)
4 Section 1.1 of this bill requires the Commission to consider any changes necessary
5 to improve access to licensure or endorsement when adopting such regulations.
6 Existing law requires a public elementary school to provide certain programs,
7 services and instruction to certain pupils who have a deficiency in the subject area
8 of reading based on state or local assessments and other relevant information. (NRS
9 392.750, 392.755) Sections 2.6 and 3 of this bill eliminate the use of local
10 assessments to determine whether a pupil has a deficiency in the subject area of
11 reading. Section 3 further provides that a pupil is not required to continue receiving
-
*SB278_R1*
– 2 –
12 services or instruction to correct a deficiency in the subject area of reading if the
13 pupil achieves a score on the statewide assessment that falls within the level
14 established by the State Board of Education for the grade level in which the pupil is
15 enrolled.
16 Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district and the
17 governing body of a charter school to prepare a report containing certain
18 information regarding pupils who receive intervention services and intensive
19 instruction to address a deficiency in the subject area of reading. (NRS 388A.487,
20 392.775) Sections 1 and 3.5 of this bill eliminate this requirement. Section 2.2 of
21 this bill prohibits any entity other than the State Board of Education from requiring
22 a public school, the board of trustees of a school district or the governing body of a
23 charter school to report information concerning pupils who receive intervention
24 services and intensive instruction to address a deficiency in the subject area of
25 reading. Section 2.4 of this bill applies the existing definition of “subject area of
26 reading” to the provisions of section 2.2.

SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to education.
(BDR 34-788)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; requiring the Commission on
Professional Standards in Education to consider certain
changes when adopting regulations governing licensure
for teachers and other educational personnel; eliminating
the use of local assessments to determine whether a pupil
has a deficiency in the subject area of reading for certain
purposes; revising certain reporting requirements
concerning pupils who receive certain services and
instruction to address a deficiency in the subject area of
reading; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates the Commission on Professional Standards in Education
2 and requires the Commission to adopt regulations prescribing the qualifications for
3 licensing teachers and other educational personnel. (NRS 391.011, 391.019)
4 Section 1.1 of this bill requires the Commission to consider any changes necessary
5 to improve access to licensure or endorsement when adopting such regulations.
6 Existing law requires a public elementary school to provide certain programs,
7 services and instruction to certain pupils who have a deficiency in the subject area
8 of reading based on state or local assessments and other relevant information. (NRS
9 392.750, 392.755) Sections 2.6 and 3 of this bill eliminate the use of local
10 assessments to determine whether a pupil has a deficiency in the subject area of
11 reading. Section 3 further provides that a pupil is not required to continue receiving
-
*SB278_R1*

– 2 –
12 services or instruction to correct a deficiency in the subject area of reading if the
13 pupil achieves a score on the statewide assessment that falls within the level
14 established by the State Board of Education for the grade level in which the pupil is
15 enrolled.
16 Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district and the
17 governing body of a charter school to prepare a report containing certain
18 information regarding pupils who receive intervention services and intensive
19 instruction to address a deficiency in the subject area of reading. (NRS 388A.487,
20 392.775) Sections 1 and 3.5 of this bill eliminate this requirement. Section 2.2 of
21 this bill prohibits any entity other than the State Board of Education from requiring
22 a public school, the board of trustees of a school district or the governing body of a
23 charter school to report information concerning pupils who receive intervention
24 services and intensive instruction to address a deficiency in the subject area of
25 reading. Section 2.4 of this bill applies the existing definition of “subject area of
26 reading” to the provisions of section 2.2.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
