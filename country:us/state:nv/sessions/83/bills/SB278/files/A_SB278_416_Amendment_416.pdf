EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; [prohibiting] requiring the [board of trustees of a
school district from requiring a prospective school administrator to
complete a preservice program for aspiring administrators under
certain circumstances; authorizing a person] Commission on
Professional Standards in Education to [simultaneously enroll in
multiple programs for an alternative route to] consider certain
changes when adopting regulations governing licensure for teachers
and [administrators; revising provisions relating] other educational
personnel; eliminating the use of local assessments to [plans to
monitor the growth of pupils] determine whether a pupil has a
deficiency in the subject area of reading [;] for certain purposes;
revising certain reporting requirements concerning pupils who
receive certain services and instruction to address a deficiency in
the subject area of reading; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 [Existing law authorizes the board of trustees of a school district to employ a
2 superintendent of schools of the school district, teachers, teacher aides, paraprofessionals and
3 all other necessary employees. (NRS 391.100) Section 2 of this bill prohibits the board of
4 trustees of a school district from requiring a prospective school administrator to complete a
5 preservice program for aspiring administrators as a condition precedent to applying for
6 employment as a school administrator.]
7 Existing law creates the Commission on Professional Standards in Education and requires
8 the Commission to adopt regulations prescribing the qualifications for licensing teachers and
9 other educational personnel. (NRS 391.011, 391.019) [Among other requirements, existing
10 law requires the regulations adopted by the Commission to set forth the qualifications for
11 licensing teachers and administrators through an alternative route to licensure. (NRS

Senate Amendment No. 416 to Senate Bill No. 278 Page 4
12 391.019)] Section [1] 1.1 of this bill requires the Commission to consider any changes
13 necessary to improve access to licensure or endorsement when adopting such regulations .
14 [to authorize a person to simultaneously enroll in multiple programs for an alternative route to
15 licensure.]
16 Existing law requires a public elementary school to [: (1) establish a plan] provide
17 certain programs, services and instruction to [monitor the growth of] certain pupils who
18 have a deficiency in the subject area of reading [; and (2) regularly assess the growth of a
19 pupil for whom a plan is established. (NRS 392.755) Section 3 of this bill requires a plan to
20 monitor the growth of such a pupil to use, to the greatest extent possible,] based on state or
21 local assessments [administered on a school-wide or grade level-wide basis for the purpose of
22 regularly assessing the growth of a pupil.] and other relevant information. (NRS 392.750,
23 392.755) Sections 2.6 and 3 of this bill eliminate the use of local assessments to determine
24 whether a pupil has a deficiency in the subject area of reading. Section 3 further
25 provides that a pupil is not required to continue receiving services or instruction to
26 correct a deficiency in the subject area of reading if the pupil achieves a score on the
27 statewide assessment that falls within the level established by the State Board of
28 Education for the grade level in which the pupil is enrolled.
29 Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district and the governing
30 body of a charter school to prepare a report containing certain information regarding
31 pupils who receive intervention services and intensive instruction to address a deficiency
32 in the subject area of reading. (NRS 388A.487, 392.775) Sections 1 and 3.5 of this bill
33 eliminate this requirement. Section 2.2 of this bill prohibits any entity other than the
34 State Board of Education from requiring a public school, the board of trustees of a
35 school district or the governing body of a charter school to report information
36 concerning pupils who receive intervention services and intensive instruction to address
37 a deficiency in the subject area of reading. Section 2.4 of this bill applies the existing
38 definition of “subject area of reading” to the provisions of section 2.2.

29 instruction while the pupil is enrolled in an elementary school;
30 5. Describe the policy and specific criteria adopted by the board of trustees of

40 guardian can understand;
41 9. Explain that a plan to monitor the growth of the pupil in the subject area of

51 establish a plan to monitor the growth of the pupil in the subject area of reading.

53 be established by a licensed teacher and any other relevant licensed school

Senate Amendment No. 416 to Senate Bill No. 278 Page 9
1 personnel and approved by the principal of the school and the parent or legal
2 guardian of the pupil. The plan must include a description of any intervention
3 services and intensive instruction that will be provided to the pupil to correct the
4 area of deficiency and must include that the pupil will receive intensive instruction
5 in reading until the pupil achieves adequate proficiency in the requisite reading
6 skills and reading comprehension skills necessary to perform at a level determined
7 by a statewide assessment to be within a level established by the State Board of
8 Education for a pupil enrolled in the same grade in which the pupil is enrolled.
9 Such instruction must include, without limitation, the programs and services
10 included in the plan to improve the literacy of pupils enrolled in elementary school
11 approved by the Department pursuant to NRS 388.157.
12 3. A school that establishes a plan to monitor the growth of a pupil in the
13 subject area of reading shall regularly assess the growth of the pupil in any area of
14 deficiency in the subject area of reading to ensure that the programs and services
15 provided to the pupil pursuant to subsection 1 of NRS 392.750 continue to increase
16 the proficiency of the pupil in the subject area of reading until the pupil performs at
17 a level determined by a statewide assessment to be within a level established by the
18 State Board for a pupil enrolled in the same grade in which the pupil is enrolled.
19 [To the greatest extent possible, a plan to monitor the growth of a pupil in the
20 subject area of reading must use assessments administered on a school-wide or
21 grade level-wide basis for the purpose of regularly assessing the growth of a
22 pupil.]
23 4. [As used in this section, the term “assessments administered on a school-
24 wide or grade level-wide” includes, without limitation, the Measures of Academic
25 Progress (MAP) assessment published by the Northwest Evaluation Association
26 or its successor organization.] A pupil for whom a plan is established pursuant to

28 correct a deficiency in the subject area of reading if the pupil performs at the
29 level described in subsection 3.
30 Sec. 3.5. NRS 392.775 is hereby repealed.
