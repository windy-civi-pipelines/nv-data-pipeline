16 employer shall not, pursuant to NRS 281.129, withhold any
17 amount of money from the salary or wages of a professional
18 employee within the bargaining unit to pay dues or similar fees to
19 a professional organization other than the professional
20 organization that is the exclusive representative of the bargaining
21 unit.
22 Sec. 22. 1. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a
23 recognized professional organization may represent a professional
24 employee of a state professional employer that has recognized the
25 professional organization with respect to any condition of the

27 limitation, representation in disciplinary proceedings and
28 investigations and proceedings for the adjustment of grievances,
29 regardless of whether the professional employee is a member of
30 the professional organization.
31 2. If a professional employee is in a bargaining unit that has
32 an exclusive representative, no professional organization other
33 than the professional organization designated as the exclusive
34 representative for the bargaining unit may represent the
35 professional employee.
36 3. Only the professional organization which has been
37 designated by the Board as the exclusive representative of a

41 Sec. 23. 1. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the

1 Such a professional employee has the right to present grievances
2 to a state professional employer at any time and to have those
3 grievances adjusted.
4 2. If a professional employee, acting for himself or herself,
5 presents a grievance to a state professional employer pursuant to
6 subsection 1:
7 (a) Any action taken in the adjustment of a grievance must be
8 consistent with the terms of an applicable collective bargaining
9 agreement in effect, if any; and
10 (b) If the professional employee is in a bargaining unit that
11 has an exclusive representative, the exclusive representative must
12 be given an opportunity to be present at any meetings or hearings
13 related to the adjustment of the grievance and be provided a copy
14 of the adjustment of the grievance.
15 Sec. 24. 1. Subject to the conditions imposed by section 22
16 of this act and any other conditions and limitations as may be set
17 forth in a collective bargaining agreement, a professional

19 (a) Is the subject of an internal administrative investigation
20 that could lead to dismissal, involuntary demotion, suspension,
21 reduction of pay, payment of restitution or other similar adverse
22 employment action against the professional employee; or
23 (b) During any questioning by a state professional employer,
24 reasonably believes that the questioning could lead to the
25 consequences set forth in paragraph (a),
26  must be afforded the right to have a lawyer or other

35 determine, in consultation with the recognized organization or
36 organizations, which group or groups of its professional
37 employees constitute an appropriate bargaining unit or bargaining
38 units. The primary criterion for that determination must be the
39 community of interest among the employees concerned. Without
40 restricting the rights of the parties to make their determination
41 pursuant to this subsection, for the Nevada System of Higher
42 Education, there is a presumption that the contact, interests and
43 working conditions of:
44 (a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b),
45 professional employees within an occupational group create a
-
*AB191*
– 14 –
1 sufficient community of interest for all employees in that
2 occupational group.
3 (b) Academic faculty members within a branch university,

13 unit of which they would otherwise be a member.
14 4. A supervisory employee must not be a member of the same
15 bargaining unit as the professional employees under the
16 supervision of the supervisory employee. Any dispute between the
17 parties as to whether a professional employee is a supervisor must
18 be submitted to the Board.
19 5. A professional organization which is negotiating on behalf
20 of two or more bargaining units of the same state professional
21 employer may, by mutual consent, select members of each unit to
22 negotiate jointly on part or all subjects of bargaining set forth in
23 section 32 of this act on behalf of each other, even if one of the
24 units consists of supervisory employees and the other unit does
25 not. Any provision of a collective bargaining agreement which is
26 negotiated jointly pursuant to this subsection must be included in
27 the draft or modification of a collective bargaining agreement
28 which is submitted for a vote for ratification in accordance with
29 section 39 of this act but is not part of the agreement unless the
30 members of the professional organization within the relevant
31 bargaining unit ratify the provision in accordance with the
32 provisions of section 39 of this act.
33 6. If any professional organization is aggrieved by the
34 determination of a bargaining unit, it may appeal to the Board.
35 Subject to judicial review, the decision of the Board is binding
36 upon the state professional employer and any professional
37 organization involved. The Board shall apply the same criterion as
38 specified in subsection 1.
39 Sec. 26. If no professional organization is designated as the
40 exclusive representative of a bargaining unit and a recognized
41 professional organization files with the Board a showing of
42 interest for the professional organization by more than 50 percent
43 of the professional employees in a bargaining unit which is

7 a written request for an election which includes a showing of
8 interest for the professional organization by at least 30 percent but
9 not more than 50 percent of the professional employees within the
10 bargaining unit which is verified by the Board pursuant to section
11 28 of this act; and
12 (b) No other election to choose, change or discontinue
13 exclusive representation has been conducted within the
14 bargaining unit during the immediately preceding 12 months.

37 exclusive representation has been conducted within the
38 bargaining unit during the immediately preceding 12 months.
39 Sec. 28. 1. The Board shall verify each showing of interest
40 filed by a professional organization pursuant to section 26 or 27 of
41 this act and the identity of each professional employee identified in
42 a written request filed by a group of professional employees
43 pursuant to subparagraph (2) of paragraph (a) of subsection 2 of
44 section 27 of this act by comparing the name of a professional

24 employees of the System. As used in this subsection, “professional
25 employee” has the meaning ascribed to it in section 13 of this act.
26 Sec. 66. 1. Insofar as they conflict with the provisions of
27 such an agreement, the amendatory provisions of this act do not
28 apply during the current term of any collective bargaining
29 agreement entered into before July 1, 2025, or the first day in July
30 after this act becomes law pursuant to Section 35 of Article 4 of the

66 the collective bargaining agreement prevail.
67 Section 39 of this bill requires any new or modified collective bargaining
68 agreement between a state professional employer and an exclusive representative to
69 be: (1) submitted to the members of the professional organization for a ratification
70 vote; and (2) approved at a public hearing by, depending on the state professional
71 employer, either the State Board of Examiners or the Board of Regents. Sections 45
72 and 62 of this bill provide that certain meetings convened for the purpose of
73 collective bargaining and resolving disputes relating to collective bargaining are
74 exempt from the provisions of existing law requiring open and public meetings of
75 public bodies.
76 Sections 42-44 of this bill provide for the mediation and arbitration of disputes

86 employed by the local government employer or the Executive Department in the
87 first pay period of the immediately preceding fiscal year. (NRS 288.139, 288.475)
88 Section 49 of this bill requires the Board to assess a similar fee on each state
89 professional employer based on the number of professional employees in a
90 bargaining unit that had an exclusive representative in the first pay period of the
91 immediately preceding fiscal year.
92 Sections 50 and 51 of this bill authorize: (1) a state professional employer to

99 many legislative measures as are necessary to carry out the provisions of sections
100 6-51. Sections 55 and 59 of this bill revise provisions of existing law prohibiting
101 strikes against the State or a local government employer by an employee
102 organization or labor organization for the purpose of also prohibiting strikes by a
103 professional organization.
104 Sections 4, 5 and 7-16 of this bill define certain words and terms applicable to

109 collective bargaining.

40 restricting the rights of the parties to make their determination

19 5. A professional organization which is negotiating on behalf
20 of two or more bargaining units of the same state professional
21 employer may, by mutual consent, select members of each unit to
22 negotiate jointly on part or all subjects of bargaining set forth in
23 section 32 of this act on behalf of each other, even if one of the
24 units consists of supervisory employees and the other unit does

26 negotiated jointly pursuant to this subsection must be included in
27 the draft or modification of a collective bargaining agreement
28 which is submitted for a vote for ratification in accordance with
29 section 39 of this act but is not part of the agreement unless the

38 bargaining unit during the immediately preceding 12 months.
39 Sec. 28. 1. The Board shall verify each showing of interest
40 filed by a professional organization pursuant to section 26 or 27 of

43 pursuant to subparagraph (2) of paragraph (a) of subsection 2 of
44 section 27 of this act by comparing the name of a professional
