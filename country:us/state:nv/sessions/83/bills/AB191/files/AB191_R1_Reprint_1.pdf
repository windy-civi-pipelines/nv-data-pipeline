Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes collective bargaining between: (1) local government
2 employers and local government employees; and (2) the State and certain state
3 employees. (Chapter 288 of NRS) This bill authorizes collective bargaining
4 between state professional employers and professional employees. Section 5 of this
5 bill defines “state professional employer” to mean a board, commission or similar
6 body within the Executive Department of the State Government, including, without
7 limitation, the Board of Regents of the University of Nevada, that employs 400 or
8 more professional employees. Section 13 of this bill defines “professional
9 employee” to mean a person who, with various exceptions, is employed by a state
10 professional employer and who is: (1) in the unclassified service of the State; or (2)
11 paid in accordance with any arrangement other than the pay plan for the classified
12 service of the State.
13 Sections 2, 56 and 58 of this bill expand the powers and duties of the
14 Government Employee-Management Relations Board to include hearing and
15 deciding disputes between state professional employers and professional
16 employees.
17 Section 17 of this bill sets forth certain legislative findings and declarations.
18 Section 18 of this bill authorizes professional employees to organize, form, join
19 and assist professional organizations and engage in collective bargaining activity or
20 refrain from engaging in such activity. Sections 1 and 21 of this bill authorize an
21 officer of a state professional employer to, upon written authorization by a
22 professional employee, withhold money from the salary or wages of the employee
23 to pay dues or fees to a professional organization.
24 Section 19 of this bill provides for the recognition of a professional
25 organization by a state professional employer. Sections 19 and 57 of this bill set
26 forth the conditions under which a state professional employer is authorized to
27 withdraw such recognition. Section 22 of this bill: (1) authorizes a recognized
28 professional organization to, with certain limitations, represent a professional
29 employee with respect to any condition of the employment of the employee; and (2)
30 provides that only an exclusive representative may engage in collective bargaining
31 on behalf of the professional employees of the applicable bargaining unit.
32 Section 23 of this bill authorizes, with certain conditions, a professional
33 employee to act for himself or herself with respect to conditions of his or her
34 employment. Section 20 of this bill establishes certain rights of professional
35 organizations. Section 24 of this bill requires a professional employee who could
36 be subject to certain adverse employment actions to be afforded the right to be
37 represented unless the professional employee waives, in writing, that right.
38 Section 25 of this bill provides for the creation and organization of bargaining
39 units. Sections 26-30 of this bill set forth procedures for a professional organization
40 to be designated by the Board, either with or without an election, as an exclusive
41 representative of a bargaining unit. Sections 28 and 61 of this bill: (1) require the
42 Board to verify each showing of interest filed by a professional organization against
43 the employment records of the state professional employer; and (2) provide that a
44 showing of interest by a professional employee or a petition requesting an election
45 relating to exclusive representation submitted to the Board is confidential and not a
46 public record.
47 Section 31 of this bill requires each state professional employer that has
48 recognized one or more professional organizations and each professional
49 organization to file certain reports with the Board annually.
50 Section 32 of this bill sets forth certain subjects that constitute the scope of
51 mandatory bargaining. Section 33 of this bill requires negotiations between an
52 exclusive representative and a state professional employer to commence not later
53 than 60 calendar days after one party gives notice to the other party. Section 34 of
54 this bill sets forth certain duties of an exclusive representative. Section 35 of this

59 organization to be represented by a licensed attorney in negotiations with a state
60 professional employer.
61 Sections 36, 37, 40 and 41 of this bill set forth various requirements and
62 limitations relating to the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement. Sections
63 63 and 64 of this bill provide that in the event of a conflict between certain policies
64 and procedures for personnel adopted by the Board of Regents of the University of
65 Nevada and the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement, the provisions of
66 the collective bargaining agreement prevail.
67 Section 39 of this bill requires any new or modified collective bargaining
68 agreement between a state professional employer and an exclusive representative to
69 be: (1) submitted to the members of the professional organization for a ratification
70 vote; and (2) approved at a public hearing by, depending on the state professional
71 employer, either the State Board of Examiners or the Board of Regents. Sections 45
72 and 62 of this bill provide that certain meetings convened for the purpose of
73 collective bargaining and resolving disputes relating to collective bargaining are
74 exempt from the provisions of existing law requiring open and public meetings of
75 public bodies.
76 Sections 42-44 of this bill provide for the mediation and arbitration of disputes
77 between state professional employers and exclusive representatives.

79 bargaining. Section 47 of this bill sets forth procedures to establish that a party has
80 committed such a prohibited practice.
81 Section 48 of this bill establishes certain provisions relating to actions brought
82 by or against state professional employers or professional organizations.
83 Existing law requires the Government Employee-Management Relations Board
84 to annually assess a fee on local government employers and the Executive
85 Department for the support of the Board based on the number of employees
86 employed by the local government employer or the Executive Department in the
87 first pay period of the immediately preceding fiscal year. (NRS 288.139, 288.475)
88 Section 49 of this bill requires the Board to assess a similar fee on each state
89 professional employer based on the number of professional employees in a
90 bargaining unit that had an exclusive representative in the first pay period of the
91 immediately preceding fiscal year.
92 Sections 50 and 51 of this bill authorize: (1) a state professional employer to
93 use the services of the Division of Human Resource Management of the

99 many legislative measures as are necessary to carry out the provisions of sections
100 6-51. Sections 55 and 59 of this bill revise provisions of existing law prohibiting
101 strikes against the State or a local government employer by an employee
102 organization or labor organization for the purpose of also prohibiting strikes by a
103 professional organization.

13 Board of Regents.
14 3. In the event of a conflict between the personnel policies
15 and procedures established pursuant to subsection 1 and the
16 provisions of a collective bargaining agreement entered into
17 pursuant to sections 6 to 51, inclusive, of this act, the provisions of
18 the collective bargaining agreement prevail.

21 1. The power to fix the salaries of the academic staff of the

27 employment of the academic staff and other professional
28 employees of the System. As used in this subsection, “professional
29 employee” has the meaning ascribed to it in section 13 of this act.
30 Sec. 66. 1. Insofar as they conflict with the provisions of
31 such an agreement, the amendatory provisions of this act do not
32 apply during the current term of any collective bargaining
33 agreement entered into before July 1, 2025, or the first day in July
34 after this act becomes law pursuant to Section 35 of Article 4 of the
35 Nevada Constitution, whichever is later, but do apply to any

42 professional organization as the exclusive representative for a
43 bargaining unit as of July 1, 2025, or the first day in July after this
