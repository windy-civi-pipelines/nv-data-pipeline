3 of NRS) This bill authorizes collective bargaining between state professional employers and
4 professional employees. Section 5 of this bill defines “state professional employer” to mean a
5 board, commission or similar body within the Executive Department of the State Government,
6 including, without limitation, the Board of Regents of the University of Nevada, that employs
Assembly Amendment No. 72 to Assembly Bill No. 191 Page 4
7 400 or more professional employees. Section 13 of this bill defines “professional employee”

9 and who is: (1) in the unclassified service of the State; or (2) paid in accordance with any
10 arrangement other than the pay plan for the classified service of the State.
11 Sections 2, 56 and 58 of this bill expand the powers and duties of the Government
12 Employee-Management Relations Board to include hearing and deciding disputes between
13 state professional employers and professional employees.
14 Section 17 of this bill sets forth certain legislative findings and declarations. Section 18
15 of this bill authorizes professional employees to organize, form, join and assist professional
16 organizations and engage in collective bargaining activity or refrain from engaging in such
17 activity. Sections 1 and 21 of this bill authorize an officer of a state professional employer to,
18 upon written authorization by a professional employee, withhold money from the salary or
19 wages of the employee to pay dues or fees to a professional organization.
20 Section 19 of this bill provides for the recognition of a professional organization by a
21 state professional employer. Sections 19 and 57 of this bill set forth the conditions under
22 which a state professional employer is authorized to withdraw such recognition. Section 22 of
23 this bill: (1) authorizes a recognized professional organization to, with certain limitations,
24 represent a professional employee with respect to any condition of the employment of the
25 employee; and (2) provides that only an exclusive representative may engage in collective
26 bargaining on behalf of the professional employees of the applicable bargaining unit.
27 Section 23 of this bill authorizes, with certain conditions, a professional employee to act
28 for himself or herself with respect to conditions of his or her employment. Section 20 of this
29 bill establishes certain rights of professional organizations. Section 24 of this bill requires a
30 professional employee who could be subject to certain adverse employment actions to be
31 afforded the right to be represented unless the professional employee waives, in writing, that
32 right.
33 Section 25 of this bill provides for the creation and organization of bargaining units.
34 Sections 26-30 of this bill set forth procedures for a professional organization to be designated
35 by the Board, either with or without an election, as an exclusive representative of a bargaining
36 unit. Sections 28 and 61 of this bill: (1) require the Board to verify each showing of interest
37 filed by a professional organization against the employment records of the state professional
38 employer; and (2) provide that a showing of interest by a professional employee or a petition
39 requesting an election relating to exclusive representation submitted to the Board is
40 confidential and not a public record.
41 Section 31 of this bill requires each state professional employer that has recognized one
42 or more professional organizations and each professional organization to file certain reports
43 with the Board annually.
44 Section 32 of this bill sets forth certain subjects that constitute the scope of mandatory
45 bargaining. Section 33 of this bill requires negotiations between an exclusive representative
46 and a state professional employer to commence not later than 60 calendar days after one party
47 gives notice to the other party. Section 34 of this bill sets forth certain duties of an exclusive
48 representative. Section 35 of this bill requires a state professional employer to designate a
49 representative to engage in collective bargaining with an exclusive representative. Section 35
50 further requires a state professional employer to comply with reasonable requests to furnish

55 relating to the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement. Sections 63 and 64 of this bill
56 provide that in the event of a conflict between certain policies and procedures for personnel
57 adopted by the Board of Regents of the University of Nevada and the provisions of a
58 collective bargaining agreement, the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement prevail.
59 Section 39 of this bill requires any new or modified collective bargaining agreement
60 between a state professional employer and an exclusive representative to be: (1) submitted to
61 the members of the professional organization for a ratification vote; and (2) approved at a
62 public hearing by, depending on the state professional employer, either the State Board of
63 Examiners or the Board of Regents. Sections 45 and 62 of this bill provide that certain
64 meetings convened for the purpose of collective bargaining and resolving disputes relating to
Assembly Amendment No. 72 to Assembly Bill No. 191 Page 5
65 collective bargaining are exempt from the provisions of existing law requiring open and
66 public meetings of public bodies.
67 Sections 42-44 of this bill provide for the mediation and arbitration of disputes between
68 state professional employers and exclusive representatives.

71 prohibited practice.
72 Section 48 of this bill establishes certain provisions relating to actions brought by or
73 against state professional employers or professional organizations.
74 Existing law requires the Government Employee-Management Relations Board to
75 annually assess a fee on local government employers and the Executive Department for the
76 support of the Board based on the number of employees employed by the local government
77 employer or the Executive Department in the first pay period of the immediately preceding
78 fiscal year. (NRS 288.139, 288.475) Section 49 of this bill requires the Board to assess a
79 similar fee on each state professional employer based on the number of professional
80 employees in a bargaining unit that had an exclusive representative in the first pay period of
81 the immediately preceding fiscal year.
82 Sections 50 and 51 of this bill authorize: (1) a state professional employer to use the
83 services of the Division of Human Resource Management of the Department of
84 Administration and the Attorney General to provide support to the state professional employer
85 to carry out the provisions of sections 6-51 of this bill; and (2) the Division of Human
86 Resource Management and the Attorney General to charge the state professional employer for
87 any such services provided.
88 Section 60 of this bill authorizes the Governor to request the drafting of as many
89 legislative measures as are necessary to carry out the provisions of sections 6-51. Sections 55
90 and 59 of this bill revise provisions of existing law prohibiting strikes against the State or a
91 local government employer by an employee organization or labor organization for the purpose
92 of also prohibiting strikes by a professional organization.
93 Sections 4, 5 and 7-16 of this bill define certain words and terms applicable to the
94 provisions of this bill. Sections 53 and 54 of this bill revise certain definitions relating to
95 collective bargaining that are applicable to employee organizations and labor organizations to
96 also include professional organizations. Section 52 of this bill makes the definitions in
97 sections 4 and 5 apply to existing law relating to collective bargaining.
98 Section 65 of this bill grants the Board of Regents the authority to conduct collective
99 bargaining negotiations and to enter into collective bargaining agreements with the
100 professional employees of the Nevada System of Higher Education.

18 bargaining unit except to the extent that such access is otherwise provided to the
19 general public.
20 Sec. 21. 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 4, an officer of a
21 state professional employer shall, upon written authorization by a professional
22 employee, withhold a sufficient amount of money from the salary or wages of the
23 employee pursuant to NRS 281.129 to pay dues or similar fees to a recognized
24 professional organization.

26 must comply with the provisions of chapter 719 of NRS.

30 notifying the professional organization in accordance with the terms of the
31 authorization. The professional organization shall process a revocation of an
32 authorization in a timely manner.
33 4. If the Board designates a professional organization as the exclusive
34 representative of a bargaining unit pursuant to sections 6 to 51, inclusive, of this
35 act, an officer of a state professional employer shall not, pursuant to NRS
36 281.129, withhold any amount of money from the salary or wages of a
37 professional employee within the bargaining unit to pay dues or similar fees to a
38 professional organization other than the professional organization that is the
39 exclusive representative of the bargaining unit.
40 Sec. 22. 1. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a recognized
41 professional organization may represent a professional employee of a state
42 professional employer that has recognized the professional organization with
43 respect to any condition of the employment of the professional employee,
44 including, without limitation, representation in disciplinary proceedings and
45 investigations and proceedings for the adjustment of grievances, regardless of
46 whether the professional employee is a member of the professional organization.
47 2. If a professional employee is in a bargaining unit that has an exclusive
48 representative, no professional organization other than the professional
49 organization designated as the exclusive representative for the bargaining unit
50 may represent the professional employee.
51 3. Only the professional organization which has been designated by the
52 Board as the exclusive representative of a bargaining unit pursuant to sections 6
Assembly Amendment No. 72 to Assembly Bill No. 191 Page 12
1 to 51, inclusive, of this act may engage in collective bargaining on behalf of the
2 professional employees of that bargaining unit.
3 Sec. 23. 1. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the recognition of
4 a professional organization or the designation of a professional organization as
5 an exclusive representative does not preclude a professional employee from
6 acting for himself or herself with respect to any condition of his or her
7 employment. Such a professional employee has the right to present grievances to
8 a state professional employer at any time and to have those grievances adjusted.
9 2. If a professional employee, acting for himself or herself, presents a
10 grievance to a state professional employer pursuant to subsection 1:
11 (a) Any action taken in the adjustment of a grievance must be consistent with
12 the terms of an applicable collective bargaining agreement in effect, if any; and
13 (b) If the professional employee is in a bargaining unit that has an exclusive
14 representative, the exclusive representative must be given an opportunity to be
15 present at any meetings or hearings related to the adjustment of the grievance
16 and be provided a copy of the adjustment of the grievance.
17 Sec. 24. 1. Subject to the conditions imposed by section 22 of this act and

21 to dismissal, involuntary demotion, suspension, reduction of pay, payment of
22 restitution or other similar adverse employment action against the professional
23 employee; or
24 (b) During any questioning by a state professional employer, reasonably
25 believes that the questioning could lead to the consequences set forth in
26 paragraph (a),
27  must be afforded the right to have a lawyer or other representative of the
28 professional employee’s choosing present with the professional employee unless
29 the professional employee waives, in writing, his or her right to be represented.
30 2. A state professional employer must not retaliate in any way against a
31 professional employee for asserting his or her rights under subsection 1.
32 Sec. 25. 1. Each state professional employer which has recognized one or
33 more professional organizations shall determine, in consultation with the
34 recognized organization or organizations, which group or groups of its
35 professional employees constitute an appropriate bargaining unit or bargaining
36 units. The primary criterion for that determination must be the community of
37 interest among the employees concerned. Without restricting the rights of the
38 parties to make their determination pursuant to this subsection, for the Nevada
39 System of Higher Education, there is a presumption that the contact, interests
40 and working conditions of:
41 (a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b), professional employees
42 within an occupational group create a sufficient community of interest for all
43 employees in that occupational group.
44 (b) Academic faculty members within a branch university, college or other
45 branch which has its own separate set of bylaws governing the roles and
46 responsibilities of academic faculty and the practice of shared governance create
47 a sufficient community of interest among those faculty members.

53 unit as the professional employees under the supervision of the supervisory
Assembly Amendment No. 72 to Assembly Bill No. 191 Page 13
1 employee. Any dispute between the parties as to whether a professional employee
2 is a supervisor must be submitted to the Board.
3 5. A professional organization which is negotiating on behalf of two or
4 more bargaining units of the same state professional employer may, by mutual
5 consent, select members of each unit to negotiate jointly on part or all subjects of
6 bargaining set forth in section 32 of this act on behalf of each other, even if one
7 of the units consists of supervisory employees and the other unit does not. Any
8 provision of a collective bargaining agreement which is negotiated jointly
9 pursuant to this subsection must be included in the draft or modification of a
10 collective bargaining agreement which is submitted for a vote for ratification in
11 accordance with section 39 of this act but is not part of the agreement unless the
12 members of the professional organization within the relevant bargaining unit
13 ratify the provision in accordance with the provisions of section 39 of this act.
14 6. If any professional organization is aggrieved by the determination of a
15 bargaining unit, it may appeal to the Board. Subject to judicial review, the
16 decision of the Board is binding upon the state professional employer and any
17 professional organization involved. The Board shall apply the same criterion as
18 specified in subsection 1.
19 Sec. 26. If no professional organization is designated as the exclusive
20 representative of a bargaining unit and a recognized professional organization
21 files with the Board a showing of interest for the professional organization by
22 more than 50 percent of the professional employees in a bargaining unit which is
23 verified by the Board pursuant to section 28 of this act, the Board shall designate

31 organization by at least 30 percent but not more than 50 percent of the
32 professional employees within the bargaining unit which is verified by the Board
33 pursuant to section 28 of this act; and
34 (b) No other election to choose, change or discontinue exclusive
35 representation has been conducted within the bargaining unit during the
36 immediately preceding 12 months.
37 2. If the Board has designated a professional organization as the exclusive
38 representative of a bargaining unit following an election pursuant to subsection 1
39 or without an election pursuant to section 26 of this act, the Board shall order an
40 election:
41 (a) If:
42 (1) Another recognized professional organization files with the Board a
43 written request for an election which includes a showing of interest for the
44 professional organization by more than 50 percent of the professional employees
45 within the bargaining unit; or
46 (2) A group of professional employees within the bargaining unit files
47 with the Board a written request for an election which includes a petition or other
48 evidence showing that more than 50 percent of the professional employees within

50 discontinue exclusive representation;
51 (b) If applicable, the written request filed pursuant to paragraph (a) is filed
52 at least 225 calendar days but not more than 270 calendar days before the date on

1 which the current collective bargaining agreement in effect for the bargaining
2 unit expires; and

8 of each professional employee identified in a written request filed by a group of

10 subsection 2 of section 27 of this act by comparing the name of a professional
11 employee included in the showing of interest or written request, as applicable,
12 with the employment records of the state professional employer.
13 2. A showing of interest filed by a professional organization pursuant to
14 section 26 or 27 of this act or a written request filed by a group of professional
15 employees pursuant to subparagraph (2) of paragraph (a) of subsection 2 of
16 section 27 of this act is confidential and is not a public record.
17 3. The Board shall not disclose to any person the identity of any
18 professional employee who has participated in a showing of interest filed by a
19 professional organization pursuant to section 26 or 27 of this act or a written
20 request filed by a group of professional employees pursuant to subparagraph (2)
21 of paragraph (a) of subsection 2 of section 27 of this act.

34 of the professional employees within the bargaining unit; and
35 (d) A choice for “no exclusive representation.”
36 2. If a ballot for an election contains more than two choices and none of the
37 choices on the ballot receives a majority of the votes cast at the initial election,
38 the Board shall order a runoff election between the two choices on the ballot that
39 received the highest number of votes at the initial election.
40 3. If the choice for “no exclusive representation” receives a majority of the
41 votes cast at the initial election or at any runoff election, the Board shall
42 designate the bargaining unit as being without an exclusive representative.

13 State Board of Examiners, as applicable, shall cause the following documents to
14 be posted and made available on the Internet website used by the Board of

24 agreement.
25 Sec. 40. If a provision of a collective bargaining agreement:

38 (a) The state professional employer that is a party to the agreement shall
39 include the full amount necessary to fund the provision in the proposed budget of
40 the state professional employer submitted to the Chief of the Budget Division of
41 the Office of Finance pursuant to NRS 353.210.
42 (b) The Governor may include in the biennial proposed executive budget of
43 the State any amount of money the Governor deems appropriate for the state
44 professional employer. If such amount is not sufficient to fully fund the provision
45 of the collective bargaining agreement, the Governor shall submit to the
46 Legislature and the state professional employer a statement setting forth the
47 reasons for not including the amount necessary to fully fund the provision.
48 2. If the Legislature does not appropriate the amount of money that is
49 necessary to implement fully a provision of a collective bargaining agreement,
50 any such agreement may be opened by either party to that agreement solely for

24 chapter 478, Statutes of Nevada 2011 and section 2 of chapter 391, Statutes of
25 Nevada 2013 and unless otherwise declared by law to be confidential, all public
26 books and public records of a governmental entity must be open at all times during
27 office hours to inspection by any person, and may be fully copied or an abstract or
28 memorandum may be prepared from those public books and public records. Any
29 such copies, abstracts or memoranda may be used to supply the general public with

31 the advantage of the governmental entity or of the general public. This section does
32 not supersede or in any manner affect the federal laws governing copyrights or
33 enlarge, diminish or affect in any other manner the rights of a person in any written
34 book or record which is copyrighted pursuant to federal law.
35 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record which is
36 copyrighted solely because it is copyrighted.
37 3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a public book or
38 record shall not deny a request made pursuant to subsection 1 to inspect or copy or
39 receive a copy of a public book or record on the basis that the requested public
40 book or record contains information that is confidential if the governmental entity
41 can redact, delete, conceal or separate, including, without limitation, electronically,
42 the confidential information from the information included in the public book or
43 record that is not otherwise confidential.
44 4. If requested, a governmental entity shall provide a copy of a public record
45 in an electronic format by means of an electronic medium. Nothing in this
46 subsection requires a governmental entity to provide a copy of a public record in an
47 electronic format or by means of an electronic medium if:
48 (a) The public record:
49 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
50 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
51 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by means of an
52 electronic medium would:
53 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
Assembly Amendment No. 72 to Assembly Bill No. 191 Page 30
1 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential and that
2 cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from information that is not
3 otherwise confidential.
4 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who has legal
5 custody or control of a public record:
6 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the medium that
7 is requested because the officer, employee or agent has already prepared or would
8 prefer to provide the copy in a different medium.
9 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon request, prepare
10 the copy of the public record and shall not require the person who has requested the
11 copy to prepare the copy himself or herself.
12 Sec. 62. NRS 241.016 is hereby amended to read as follows:
13 241.016 1. The meetings of a public body that are quasi-judicial in nature

21 deny, continue or revoke the parole of a prisoner or to establish or modify the terms
22 of the parole of a prisoner.

31 642.557, 686B.170, 696B.550, 703.196 and 706.1725 [,] and section 45 of this act,
32 which:
33 (a) Provides that any meeting, hearing or other proceeding is not subject to the
34 provisions of this chapter; or
35 (b) Otherwise authorizes or requires a closed meeting, hearing or proceeding,
36  prevails over the general provisions of this chapter.
37 4. The exceptions provided to this chapter, and a remote technology system or
38 electronic communication, must not be used to circumvent the spirit or letter of this
39 chapter to deliberate or act, outside of an open and public meeting, upon a matter
40 over which the public body has supervision, control, jurisdiction or advisory
41 powers.
42 Sec. 63. NRS 396.251 is hereby amended to read as follows:
43 396.251 1. The Board of Regents may establish policies and procedures for
44 personnel which govern student employees, graduate assistants, physicians
45 engaged in a program for residency training and postdoctoral fellows of the System
46 and which are separate from the policies and procedures established for the
47 unclassified personnel of the System. Any such policy or procedure does not
48 diminish the eligibility of those persons for coverage as employees under the
49 provisions of chapters 616A to 616D, inclusive, or chapter 617 of NRS.
50 2. Except as otherwise provided in sections 6 to 51, inclusive, of this act:
51 (a) In establishing policies and procedures pursuant to subsection 1, the Board
52 of Regents is not bound by any of the other provisions of this chapter or the
53 provisions of title 23 of NRS. [Those]
Assembly Amendment No. 72 to Assembly Bill No. 191 Page 31
1 (b) The provisions of this chapter and the provisions of title 23 of NRS do not
2 apply to a student employee, a graduate assistant, a physician engaged in a
3 program for residency training or a postdoctoral fellow of the System unless
4 otherwise provided by the Board of Regents.
5 3. In the event of a conflict between the policies and procedures established
6 pursuant to subsection 1 and the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement
7 entered into pursuant to sections 6 to 51, inclusive, of this act, the provisions of
8 the collective bargaining agreement prevail.
9 Sec. 64. NRS 396.7953 is hereby amended to read as follows:
10 396.7953 1. The Board of Regents may devise and establish personnel
11 policies and procedures in connection with the operation of contractual or
12 sponsored research activities of the Institute, apart from those personnel policies

3 of NRS) This bill authorizes collective bargaining between state professional employers and
4 professional employees. Section 5 of this bill defines “state professional employer” to mean a
5 board, commission or similar body within the Executive Department of the State Government,

Assembly Amendment No. 72 to Assembly Bill No. 191 Page 4
7 400 or more professional employees. Section 13 of this bill defines “professional employee”

9 and who is: (1) in the unclassified service of the State; or (2) paid in accordance with any
10 arrangement other than the pay plan for the classified service of the State.
11 Sections 2, 56 and 58 of this bill expand the powers and duties of the Government
12 Employee-Management Relations Board to include hearing and deciding disputes between
13 state professional employers and professional employees.
14 Section 17 of this bill sets forth certain legislative findings and declarations. Section 18
15 of this bill authorizes professional employees to organize, form, join and assist professional
16 organizations and engage in collective bargaining activity or refrain from engaging in such
17 activity. Sections 1 and 21 of this bill authorize an officer of a state professional employer to,
18 upon written authorization by a professional employee, withhold money from the salary or
19 wages of the employee to pay dues or fees to a professional organization.
20 Section 19 of this bill provides for the recognition of a professional organization by a
21 state professional employer. Sections 19 and 57 of this bill set forth the conditions under
22 which a state professional employer is authorized to withdraw such recognition. Section 22 of
23 this bill: (1) authorizes a recognized professional organization to, with certain limitations,
24 represent a professional employee with respect to any condition of the employment of the
25 employee; and (2) provides that only an exclusive representative may engage in collective
26 bargaining on behalf of the professional employees of the applicable bargaining unit.
27 Section 23 of this bill authorizes, with certain conditions, a professional employee to act
28 for himself or herself with respect to conditions of his or her employment. Section 20 of this
29 bill establishes certain rights of professional organizations. Section 24 of this bill requires a
30 professional employee who could be subject to certain adverse employment actions to be
31 afforded the right to be represented unless the professional employee waives, in writing, that
32 right.
33 Section 25 of this bill provides for the creation and organization of bargaining units.
34 Sections 26-30 of this bill set forth procedures for a professional organization to be designated
35 by the Board, either with or without an election, as an exclusive representative of a bargaining
36 unit. Sections 28 and 61 of this bill: (1) require the Board to verify each showing of interest
37 filed by a professional organization against the employment records of the state professional
38 employer; and (2) provide that a showing of interest by a professional employee or a petition
39 requesting an election relating to exclusive representation submitted to the Board is
40 confidential and not a public record.
41 Section 31 of this bill requires each state professional employer that has recognized one
42 or more professional organizations and each professional organization to file certain reports
43 with the Board annually.
44 Section 32 of this bill sets forth certain subjects that constitute the scope of mandatory
45 bargaining. Section 33 of this bill requires negotiations between an exclusive representative
46 and a state professional employer to commence not later than 60 calendar days after one party
47 gives notice to the other party. Section 34 of this bill sets forth certain duties of an exclusive
48 representative. Section 35 of this bill requires a state professional employer to designate a
49 representative to engage in collective bargaining with an exclusive representative. Section 35

55 relating to the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement. Sections 63 and 64 of this bill
56 provide that in the event of a conflict between certain policies and procedures for personnel
57 adopted by the Board of Regents of the University of Nevada and the provisions of a
58 collective bargaining agreement, the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement prevail.
59 Section 39 of this bill requires any new or modified collective bargaining agreement
60 between a state professional employer and an exclusive representative to be: (1) submitted to
61 the members of the professional organization for a ratification vote; and (2) approved at a
62 public hearing by, depending on the state professional employer, either the State Board of
63 Examiners or the Board of Regents. Sections 45 and 62 of this bill provide that certain
64 meetings convened for the purpose of collective bargaining and resolving disputes relating to

Assembly Amendment No. 72 to Assembly Bill No. 191 Page 5
65 collective bargaining are exempt from the provisions of existing law requiring open and
66 public meetings of public bodies.
67 Sections 42-44 of this bill provide for the mediation and arbitration of disputes between
68 state professional employers and exclusive representatives.
69 Section 46 of this bill prohibits certain practices in the context of collective bargaining.
70 Section 47 of this bill sets forth procedures to establish that a party has committed such a
71 prohibited practice.
72 Section 48 of this bill establishes certain provisions relating to actions brought by or
73 against state professional employers or professional organizations.
74 Existing law requires the Government Employee-Management Relations Board to
75 annually assess a fee on local government employers and the Executive Department for the
76 support of the Board based on the number of employees employed by the local government
77 employer or the Executive Department in the first pay period of the immediately preceding
78 fiscal year. (NRS 288.139, 288.475) Section 49 of this bill requires the Board to assess a
79 similar fee on each state professional employer based on the number of professional
80 employees in a bargaining unit that had an exclusive representative in the first pay period of
81 the immediately preceding fiscal year.
82 Sections 50 and 51 of this bill authorize: (1) a state professional employer to use the
83 services of the Division of Human Resource Management of the Department of
84 Administration and the Attorney General to provide support to the state professional employer
85 to carry out the provisions of sections 6-51 of this bill; and (2) the Division of Human
86 Resource Management and the Attorney General to charge the state professional employer for
87 any such services provided.
88 Section 60 of this bill authorizes the Governor to request the drafting of as many
89 legislative measures as are necessary to carry out the provisions of sections 6-51. Sections 55
90 and 59 of this bill revise provisions of existing law prohibiting strikes against the State or a
91 local government employer by an employee organization or labor organization for the purpose
92 of also prohibiting strikes by a professional organization.
93 Sections 4, 5 and 7-16 of this bill define certain words and terms applicable to the
94 provisions of this bill. Sections 53 and 54 of this bill revise certain definitions relating to
95 collective bargaining that are applicable to employee organizations and labor organizations to
96 also include professional organizations. Section 52 of this bill makes the definitions in
97 sections 4 and 5 apply to existing law relating to collective bargaining.
98 Section 65 of this bill grants the Board of Regents the authority to conduct collective
99 bargaining negotiations and to enter into collective bargaining agreements with the
100 professional employees of the Nevada System of Higher Education.

26 must comply with the provisions of chapter 719 of NRS.
27 3. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, a written authorization
28 provided pursuant to subsection 1 is binding for the period specified in the

30 notifying the professional organization in accordance with the terms of the
31 authorization. The professional organization shall process a revocation of an
32 authorization in a timely manner.
33 4. If the Board designates a professional organization as the exclusive
34 representative of a bargaining unit pursuant to sections 6 to 51, inclusive, of this
35 act, an officer of a state professional employer shall not, pursuant to NRS
36 281.129, withhold any amount of money from the salary or wages of a
37 professional employee within the bargaining unit to pay dues or similar fees to a
38 professional organization other than the professional organization that is the
39 exclusive representative of the bargaining unit.
40 Sec. 22. 1. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a recognized
41 professional organization may represent a professional employee of a state
42 professional employer that has recognized the professional organization with
43 respect to any condition of the employment of the professional employee,
44 including, without limitation, representation in disciplinary proceedings and
45 investigations and proceedings for the adjustment of grievances, regardless of
46 whether the professional employee is a member of the professional organization.
47 2. If a professional employee is in a bargaining unit that has an exclusive
48 representative, no professional organization other than the professional
49 organization designated as the exclusive representative for the bargaining unit
50 may represent the professional employee.
51 3. Only the professional organization which has been designated by the
52 Board as the exclusive representative of a bargaining unit pursuant to sections 6

Assembly Amendment No. 72 to Assembly Bill No. 191 Page 12
1 to 51, inclusive, of this act may engage in collective bargaining on behalf of the
2 professional employees of that bargaining unit.
3 Sec. 23. 1. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the recognition of
4 a professional organization or the designation of a professional organization as
5 an exclusive representative does not preclude a professional employee from
6 acting for himself or herself with respect to any condition of his or her
7 employment. Such a professional employee has the right to present grievances to
8 a state professional employer at any time and to have those grievances adjusted.
9 2. If a professional employee, acting for himself or herself, presents a
10 grievance to a state professional employer pursuant to subsection 1:
11 (a) Any action taken in the adjustment of a grievance must be consistent with
12 the terms of an applicable collective bargaining agreement in effect, if any; and
13 (b) If the professional employee is in a bargaining unit that has an exclusive
14 representative, the exclusive representative must be given an opportunity to be
15 present at any meetings or hearings related to the adjustment of the grievance
16 and be provided a copy of the adjustment of the grievance.
17 Sec. 24. 1. Subject to the conditions imposed by section 22 of this act and
18 any other conditions and limitations as may be set forth in a collective bargaining
19 agreement, a professional employee who:
20 (a) Is the subject of an internal administrative investigation that could lead
21 to dismissal, involuntary demotion, suspension, reduction of pay, payment of
22 restitution or other similar adverse employment action against the professional
23 employee; or
24 (b) During any questioning by a state professional employer, reasonably
25 believes that the questioning could lead to the consequences set forth in
26 paragraph (a),
27  must be afforded the right to have a lawyer or other representative of the
28 professional employee’s choosing present with the professional employee unless
29 the professional employee waives, in writing, his or her right to be represented.
30 2. A state professional employer must not retaliate in any way against a
31 professional employee for asserting his or her rights under subsection 1.
32 Sec. 25. 1. Each state professional employer which has recognized one or
33 more professional organizations shall determine, in consultation with the
34 recognized organization or organizations, which group or groups of its
35 professional employees constitute an appropriate bargaining unit or bargaining
36 units. The primary criterion for that determination must be the community of
37 interest among the employees concerned. Without restricting the rights of the
38 parties to make their determination pursuant to this subsection, for the Nevada
39 System of Higher Education, there is a presumption that the contact, interests
40 and working conditions of:
41 (a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b), professional employees
42 within an occupational group create a sufficient community of interest for all
43 employees in that occupational group.
44 (b) Academic faculty members within a branch university, college or other
45 branch which has its own separate set of bylaws governing the roles and
46 responsibilities of academic faculty and the practice of shared governance create
47 a sufficient community of interest among those faculty members.

49 3. Confidential employees must be excluded from any bargaining unit but
50 are entitled to participate in any plan to provide benefits for a group that is

52 4. A supervisory employee must not be a member of the same bargaining
53 unit as the professional employees under the supervision of the supervisory

Assembly Amendment No. 72 to Assembly Bill No. 191 Page 13
1 employee. Any dispute between the parties as to whether a professional employee
2 is a supervisor must be submitted to the Board.
3 5. A professional organization which is negotiating on behalf of two or
4 more bargaining units of the same state professional employer may, by mutual
5 consent, select members of each unit to negotiate jointly on part or all subjects of
6 bargaining set forth in section 32 of this act on behalf of each other, even if one
7 of the units consists of supervisory employees and the other unit does not. Any
8 provision of a collective bargaining agreement which is negotiated jointly
9 pursuant to this subsection must be included in the draft or modification of a
10 collective bargaining agreement which is submitted for a vote for ratification in
11 accordance with section 39 of this act but is not part of the agreement unless the
12 members of the professional organization within the relevant bargaining unit
13 ratify the provision in accordance with the provisions of section 39 of this act.
14 6. If any professional organization is aggrieved by the determination of a
15 bargaining unit, it may appeal to the Board. Subject to judicial review, the
16 decision of the Board is binding upon the state professional employer and any
17 professional organization involved. The Board shall apply the same criterion as
18 specified in subsection 1.
19 Sec. 26. If no professional organization is designated as the exclusive
20 representative of a bargaining unit and a recognized professional organization
21 files with the Board a showing of interest for the professional organization by
22 more than 50 percent of the professional employees in a bargaining unit which is
23 verified by the Board pursuant to section 28 of this act, the Board shall designate
24 the professional organization as the exclusive representative of the bargaining
25 unit without ordering an election.

31 organization by at least 30 percent but not more than 50 percent of the
32 professional employees within the bargaining unit which is verified by the Board
33 pursuant to section 28 of this act; and
34 (b) No other election to choose, change or discontinue exclusive
35 representation has been conducted within the bargaining unit during the
36 immediately preceding 12 months.
37 2. If the Board has designated a professional organization as the exclusive
38 representative of a bargaining unit following an election pursuant to subsection 1
39 or without an election pursuant to section 26 of this act, the Board shall order an
40 election:
41 (a) If:
42 (1) Another recognized professional organization files with the Board a
43 written request for an election which includes a showing of interest for the
44 professional organization by more than 50 percent of the professional employees
45 within the bargaining unit; or
46 (2) A group of professional employees within the bargaining unit files
47 with the Board a written request for an election which includes a petition or other
48 evidence showing that more than 50 percent of the professional employees within

10 subsection 2 of section 27 of this act by comparing the name of a professional
11 employee included in the showing of interest or written request, as applicable,
12 with the employment records of the state professional employer.
13 2. A showing of interest filed by a professional organization pursuant to
14 section 26 or 27 of this act or a written request filed by a group of professional
15 employees pursuant to subparagraph (2) of paragraph (a) of subsection 2 of
16 section 27 of this act is confidential and is not a public record.
17 3. The Board shall not disclose to any person the identity of any
18 professional employee who has participated in a showing of interest filed by a
19 professional organization pursuant to section 26 or 27 of this act or a written
20 request filed by a group of professional employees pursuant to subparagraph (2)
21 of paragraph (a) of subsection 2 of section 27 of this act.

34 of the professional employees within the bargaining unit; and
35 (d) A choice for “no exclusive representation.”
36 2. If a ballot for an election contains more than two choices and none of the
37 choices on the ballot receives a majority of the votes cast at the initial election,
38 the Board shall order a runoff election between the two choices on the ballot that
39 received the highest number of votes at the initial election.
40 3. If the choice for “no exclusive representation” receives a majority of the
41 votes cast at the initial election or at any runoff election, the Board shall
42 designate the bargaining unit as being without an exclusive representative.

43 record that is not otherwise confidential.
44 4. If requested, a governmental entity shall provide a copy of a public record
45 in an electronic format by means of an electronic medium. Nothing in this

47 electronic format or by means of an electronic medium if:
48 (a) The public record:
49 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
50 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
51 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by means of an
52 electronic medium would:
53 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or

Assembly Amendment No. 72 to Assembly Bill No. 191 Page 30
1 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential and that
2 cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from information that is not
3 otherwise confidential.
4 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who has legal
5 custody or control of a public record:
6 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the medium that
7 is requested because the officer, employee or agent has already prepared or would
8 prefer to provide the copy in a different medium.
9 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon request, prepare
10 the copy of the public record and shall not require the person who has requested the
11 copy to prepare the copy himself or herself.
12 Sec. 62. NRS 241.016 is hereby amended to read as follows:

31 642.557, 686B.170, 696B.550, 703.196 and 706.1725 [,] and section 45 of this act,

33 (a) Provides that any meeting, hearing or other proceeding is not subject to the
34 provisions of this chapter; or

39 chapter to deliberate or act, outside of an open and public meeting, upon a matter
40 over which the public body has supervision, control, jurisdiction or advisory
41 powers.

44 personnel which govern student employees, graduate assistants, physicians
45 engaged in a program for residency training and postdoctoral fellows of the System
46 and which are separate from the policies and procedures established for the
47 unclassified personnel of the System. Any such policy or procedure does not
48 diminish the eligibility of those persons for coverage as employees under the
49 provisions of chapters 616A to 616D, inclusive, or chapter 617 of NRS.
50 2. Except as otherwise provided in sections 6 to 51, inclusive, of this act:

2 apply to a student employee, a graduate assistant, a physician engaged in a
3 program for residency training or a postdoctoral fellow of the System unless

5 3. In the event of a conflict between the policies and procedures established
6 pursuant to subsection 1 and the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement

11 policies and procedures in connection with the operation of contractual or

15 2. Except as otherwise provided in sections 6 to 51, inclusive, of this act:
16 (a) In devising and establishing such personnel policies and procedures, the
