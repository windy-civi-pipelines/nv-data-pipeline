FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.

~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to offenders; providing for the establishment of a program to
provide telephone calls free of charge between certain offenders and
the families of such offenders; revising provisions relating to charges
for audio and video calls made by or to offenders; making an
appropriation; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Senate Bill No. 234 of the 2023 Legislative Session (S.B. 234) required the Department
2 of Corrections to establish and administer a pilot program to provide telephone calls between
3 offenders in the custody of the Department who have been assigned to Florence McClure
4 Women’s Correctional Center and the families of such offenders. S.B. 234 required the
5 program to: (1) be designed to facilitate and encourage a continuing relationship between the
6 offenders and the families of such offenders; and (2) provide each offender with a 15-minute
7 telephone call each day to a member of the family of the offender free of charge. S.B. 234
8 expired by limitation on January 1, 2025. (Chapter 443, Statutes of Nevada 2023, at page
9 2727) Section 1 of this bill codifies and makes permanent the pilot program established
10 pursuant to S.B. 234. Section 2.5 of this bill makes an appropriation to the Department to
11 carry out the provisions of section 1.
12 Existing law requires the Director of the Department, with the approval of the Board of
13 State Prison Commissioners, to establish by regulation criteria for a reasonable deduction
14 from money credited to the account of an offender to repay the cost incurred by the
15 Department on behalf of the offender for telephone calls charged to the Department. (NRS
16 209.246) Existing federal regulations require a provider of Incarcerated People’s
17 Communication Services (IPCS) to make a reasonable effort to refund money deposited into
18 an IPCS Account under certain circumstances. (47 C.F.R. § 64.6130) Section 2 of this bill: (1)
19 prohibits the Department from charging an offender more than the actual cost to the
20 Department for any audio or video calls made by or to an offender; and (2) requires that if the
21 Department enters into a contract with a provider of communications services to provide
22 communications services to offenders, the contract must include, without limitation, a
23 provision requiring the provider to comply with the provisions of federal regulations relating
24 to the return of money deposited into an IPCS Account, as those regulations existed on
25 January 1, 2025.
