EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to offenders; providing for the establishment of a
program to provide telephone calls free of charge between
certain offenders and the families of such offenders;
revising provisions relating to charges for audio and video
calls made by or to offenders; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Senate Bill No. 234 of the 2023 Legislative Session (S.B. 234) required the
2 Department of Corrections to establish and administer a pilot program to provide
3 telephone calls between offenders in the custody of the Department who have been
4 assigned to Florence McClure Women’s Correctional Center and the families of
5 such offenders. S.B. 234 required the program to: (1) be designed to facilitate and
6 encourage a continuing relationship between the offenders and the families of such
7 offenders; and (2) provide each offender with a 15-minute telephone call each day
8 to a member of the family of the offender free of charge. S.B. 234 expired by
9 limitation on January 1, 2025. (Chapter 443, Statutes of Nevada 2023, at page
10 2727) Section 1 of this bill codifies and makes permanent the pilot program
11 established pursuant to S.B. 234.
12 Existing law requires the Director of the Department, with the approval of the
13 Board of State Prison Commissioners, to establish by regulation criteria for a
14 reasonable deduction from money credited to the account of an offender to repay
15 the cost incurred by the Department on behalf of the offender for telephone calls
16 charged to the Department. (NRS 209.246) Existing federal regulations require a
17 provider of Incarcerated People’s Communication Services (IPCS) to make a
18 reasonable effort to refund money deposited into an IPCS Account under certain
19 circumstances. (47 C.F.R. § 64.6130) Section 2 of this bill: (1) prohibits the
20 Department from charging an offender more than the actual cost to the Department
21 for any audio or video calls made by or to an offender; and (2) requires that if the
22 Department enters into a contract with a provider of communications services to

23 provide communications services to offenders, the contract must include, without
24 limitation, a provision requiring the provider to comply with the provisions of
25 federal regulations relating to the return of money deposited into an IPCS Account,
26 as those regulations existed on January 1, 2025.
