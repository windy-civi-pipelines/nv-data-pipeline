EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; providing for Medicaid coverage of
attendant care services for frail elderly persons; requiring
the establishment of an Internet website to facilitate
connection between agencies to provide personal care
services in the home and persons in need of personal care
services; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Federal law authorizes states to receive federal financial participation to
2 support the provision of certain home and community-based services, including
3 attendant care services, for recipients of Medicaid who are elderly. (42 U.S.C. §
4 1396n) Existing law requires the Department of Health and Human Services to
5 apply to the Secretary of Health and Human Services for a waiver that provides
6 such federal financial participation. (NRS 422.396) Section 1 of this bill requires
7 the Department to apply to the Secretary of Health and Human Services to amend
8 its home and community-based services waiver to authorize this State to receive
9 federal financial participation to partially cover the costs of attendant care services
10 for frail elderly persons. Section 3 of this bill makes a conforming change to
11 indicate that section 1 will be administered in the same manner as other provisions
12 of existing law governing Medicaid.
13 Existing law requires an agency to provide personal care services in the home
14 to be licensed by the Division of Public and Behavioral Health of the Department
15 of Health and Human Services. (NRS 449.0045, 449.030) Section 2 of this bill
16 requires the Aging and Disability Services Division of the Department, in
17 collaboration with the Division of Public and Behavioral Health of the Department,
-
