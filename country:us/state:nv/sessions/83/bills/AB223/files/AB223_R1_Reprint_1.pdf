Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Section 3 of this bill defines the term “loss of value” for purposes of the
2 provisions set forth in existing law governing the relationship between landlords
3 and tenants. (Chapter 118A of NRS)
4 Existing law requires a written rental agreement to contain provisions relating
5 to certain subjects, including certain information concerning the contact
6 information of the landlord or his or her authorized representative. (NRS 118A.200)
-
*AB223_R1*

– 2 –
7 Section 6 of this bill requires the electronic mail address of the landlord or his or
8 her authorized representative to be included in such provisions.
9 Existing law provides that the absence of a written agreement raises certain
10 disputable presumptions, including a presumption that maintenance and waste
11 removal services are provided without charge to the tenant. (NRS 118A.200)
12 Section 6 additionally includes the provision of utility services at no charge to the
13 tenant in such a presumption.
14 Existing law sets forth certain provisions governing the payment of rent by a
15 tenant and the delivery of certain signed written receipts to a tenant. (NRS
16 118A.210, 118A.250) Section 8 of this bill requires a landlord to provide a written
17 receipt to a tenant upon the receipt of each payment of rent.
18 Existing law requires a landlord, at all times during a tenancy, to maintain a
19 dwelling unit in a habitable condition and provides that a dwelling unit is not
20 habitable if it violates provisions of certain housing or health codes or if it
21 substantially lacks certain things, including floors, walls, ceilings, stairways and
22 railings which are maintained in good repair. (NRS 118A.290) Section 9 of this bill
23 additionally provides that a dwelling unit is not habitable if it substantially lacks:
24 (1) doors and windows which are maintained in good repair; (2) effective measures
25 in place to control the presence of rodents, insects and vermin; (3) effective
26 measures in place to prevent exposure to unsafe levels of radon, lead paint,
27 asbestos, toxic mold and other hazardous substances; (4) in the dwelling unit and
28 any other part of the areas on the premises under the landlord’s control, locks which
29 are maintained in good repair on all exterior doors and all windows which are
30 capable of being opened; and (5) safety equipment which is required by law to be
31 included in the dwelling unit maintained in good working order.
32 Existing law requires, if a landlord fails to comply with a rental agreement, a
33 tenant to deliver a written notice to the landlord specifying the acts and omissions
34 constituting the breach and stating that the rental agreement will be terminated.
35 Existing law further authorizes, if the landlord fails to remedy the breach or make a
36 reasonable effort to do so within 14 days after receipt of the notice, a tenant to: (1)
37 terminate the rental agreement immediately; (2) recover actual damages; and (3)
38 apply to the court for such relief as the court deems proper under the circumstances.
39 (NRS 118A.350) Section 10 of this bill authorizes the tenant to terminate the rental
40 agreement without incurring any fee which is assessed by the landlord for the early
41 termination of a rental agreement and authorizes the tenant to additionally provide
42 the landlord with written notice of the intent of the tenant to terminate the rental
43 agreement on a date which is not later than 60 days after the date the notice is
44 provided to the landlord. Sections 11 and 12 of this bill similarly authorize tenants
45 whose landlords have failed to maintain a dwelling unit in a habitable condition or
46 supply essential items and services to terminate a rental agreement in this manner.
47 (NRS 118A.355, 118A.380)
48 Existing law further prohibits a tenant from taking certain remedial actions if
49 the breach is remediable and the landlord adequately remedies the breach or uses
50 his or her best efforts to remedy the breach within 14 days after receipt of the
51 notice. (NRS 118A.350) Section 10 instead provides that a tenant is prohibited
52 from taking such remedial actions if the breach is remediable and the landlord
53 remedies the breach within the prescribed time. Existing law additionally prohibits
54 a tenant from taking such remedial actions unless the tenant has provided the
55 landlord with certain notice but authorizes the tenant to recover actual damages
56 without such notice if the landlord: (1) admits to the court that the landlord had
57 knowledge of the condition constituting the breach; or (2) has received written
58 notice of that condition from a governmental agency authorized to inspect for
59 violations of building, housing or health codes. (NRS 118A.350) Section 10 instead
60 authorizes the tenant to recover actual damages without providing such notice if the
61 landlord: (1) received written notice of that condition from such a governmental
-
*AB223_R1*

– 3 –
62 agency; or (2) had actual knowledge of the condition constituting the breach.
63 Sections 11 and 12 similarly, for tenants whose landlords have failed to maintain a
64 dwelling unit in a habitable condition or supply essential items and services: (1)
65 remove language which would prohibit such tenants from taking certain remedial
66 actions if the landlord has failed to adequately remedy the failure or used his or her
67 best efforts to remedy the concern; and (2) revise the circumstances under which a
68 tenant is authorized to take certain remedial actions without providing notice. (NRS
69 118A.355, 118A.380)
70 Existing law authorizes a tenant whose landlord has failed to maintain a
71 dwelling unit in a habitable condition to take certain remedial actions if a landlord
72 fails to adequately remedy the failure or use his or her best efforts to remedy the
73 failure within a certain period of time. (NRS 118A.355) Section 4 of this bill
74 authorizes a tenant, in addition to such remedial actions, to file a verified complaint
75 for expedited relief with the court and sets forth procedures relating to the filing,
76 hearing and disposition of such a verified complaint. Section 4 also: (1) authorizes
77 a tenant who files such a verified complaint to withhold any rent that becomes due
78 without incurring late fees, charges for notice or certain other charges until the
79 landlord has remedied the failure; (2) authorizes the court to order that such rent be
80 placed into an escrow account which is maintained or approved by the court; and
81 (3) requires the payment of all costs and official fees for any tenant who files such a
82 verified complaint to be deferred and later assessed against the party that does not
83 prevail. Section 17 of this bill authorizes a tenant to provide a copy of the notice
84 provided to a landlord to a district board of health for purposes of certain provisions
85 relating to the inspection of and administrative proceedings concerning health
86 hazards, in addition to any remedy provided in section 4.
87 Existing law further requires justice courts to establish by local rule a
88 mechanism by which tenants that withhold rent under such circumstances may
89 deposit such rent into an escrow account maintained or approved by the court.
90 (NRS 118A.355) Section 11: (1) requires such rules to additionally provide for the
91 deposit of rent withheld pursuant to section 4; and (2) prohibits a court from
92 releasing any money deposited into such accounts until the time period to file an
93 appeal has run.
94 Existing law authorizes, under certain circumstances, a tenant to withhold any
95 rent that becomes due without incurring certain charges until the landlord has
96 remedied, or has attempted in good faith to remedy, certain failures to maintain a
97 dwelling in a habitable condition. Existing law further provides that a tenant who
98 takes such actions does not have a defense to an eviction unless the tenant has
99 deposited the withheld rent into an escrow account maintained or approved by the
100 court. (NRS 118A.355) Section 11 instead provides that a tenant does not have
101 such a defense unless: (1) he or she has deposited the withheld rent minus any
102 applicable loss of value, into such an escrow account; or (2) the court determines, at
103 the time of the hearing, that the tenant has otherwise retained or is capable of
104 paying the withheld rent minus any applicable loss of value.
105 Existing law additionally prohibits a tenant whose landlord has failed to
106 maintain a dwelling unit in a habitable condition from taking certain remedial
107 actions if the condition was caused by the tenant’s own deliberate or negligent act
108 or omission or that of a member of his or her household or other person on the
109 premises with his or her consent. (NRS 118A.355) Section 11 prohibits such a
110 tenant from taking such remedial actions, including filing a verified complaint for
111 expedited relief pursuant to section 4, if the condition was proven, by clear and
112 convincing evidence, to have been caused by the tenant’s own deliberate or
113 negligent act or omission or that of a member of his or her household or other
114 person on the premises with his or her consent who is not another tenant, or guest
115 thereof, on the premises pursuant to a separate rental agreement. Section 12
116 similarly prohibits a tenant whose landlord has willfully or negligently failed to
-
*AB223_R1*

– 4 –
117 supply essential items or services from taking certain remedial actions under such
118 circumstances. (NRS 118A.380)
119 Existing law authorizes a tenant to take certain remedial actions if his or her
120 landlord willfully or negligently fails to supply essential items or services and by
121 doing so, caused the premises to become unfit for habitation. Existing law further
122 provides a nonexhaustive list of certain items and services which constitute
123 essential items or services, including, heat, air-conditioning, running water, hot
124 water, electricity, gas and a functioning door lock. (NRS 118A.380) Section 12
125 includes in such a list a functioning window lock and functional safety equipment.
126 Existing law authorizes a tenant to take certain actions and recover actual
127 damages or an amount not greater than $2,500 which is fixed by a court, or both, if
128 a landlord: (1) unlawfully removes the tenant from the premises or excludes the
129 tenant by blocking or attempting to block the tenant’s entry upon the premises; (2)
130 willfully interrupts or causes or permits the interruption of any essential item or
131 service required by the rental agreement or by law; or (3) recovers possession of the
132 dwelling unit under certain other circumstances which are prohibited by existing
133 law. (NRS 118A.390) Section 13 of this bill: (1) revises the monetary amount that
134 a tenant is authorized to recover by instead providing that the tenant is authorized to
135 recover an amount which is three times the periodic rent or the tenant’s actual
136 damages, whichever is greater; and (2) additionally authorizes such remedial
137 measures in circumstances where a landlord negligently interrupts or causes or
138 permits the interruption of any essential item or service required by the rental
139 agreement or by law. Section 15 of this bill makes a conforming change to make
140 the revisions made by section 13 inapplicable to provisions governing liability of a
141 landlord who unlawfully retains the household goods or personal property of a
142 tenant. (NRS 118A.520) Section 16 of this bill makes a conforming change to
143 require certain notices provided to a tenant to include notice of the ability of the
144 tenant to seek relief if a landlord negligently interrupts or causes or permits the
145 interruption of any essential item or service required by the rental agreement or by
146 law. (NRS 40.253)
147 Section 13: (1) requires a landlord to provide a tenant who terminates his or her
148 rental agreement under certain circumstances to provide the tenant with a
149 reasonable length of time to gather his or her belongings; (2) provides that a
150 landlord who was provided notice by a tenant which specified the willful or
151 negligent failure to supply essential items or services and failed to remedy the
152 breach is presumed to have negligently caused the interruption of the essential
153 items or services; and (3) provides that a landlord may overcome such a
154 presumption by showing clear and convincing evidence that the restoration could
155 not be accomplished within the notice period. Finally, section 13 removes the
156 requirement for a tenant to file certain verified complaints for expedited relief with
157 the court 5 judicial days after the last date of the unlawful act by the landlord.
158 (NRS 118A.390)
159 Existing law: (1) requires a landlord, or any person authorized to enter into a
160 rental agreement on his or her behalf, to disclose certain information to a tenant in
161 writing before the commencement of a tenancy or to post such information in
162 certain areas; and (2) authorizes a tenant to recover actual damages or $25,
163 whichever is greater, after a demand if the landlord fails to make such disclosures
164 or postings. (NRS 118A.260, 118A.270, 118A.410) Section 14 of this bill instead
165 provides that a tenant is authorized to recover actual damages or an amount equal to
166 5 percent of the periodic rent, whichever is greater, under such circumstances.
167 Section 5 of this bill makes a conforming change to indicate the placement of
168 section 3 in the Nevada Revised Statutes.

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 118A of NRS is hereby amended by
2 adding thereto the provisions set forth as sections 2, 3 and 4 of this
3 act.
4 Sec. 2. (Deleted by amendment.)
5 Sec. 3. “Loss of value” means a portion of the rent of a
6 dwelling unit which:
7 (a) Reflects the amount of rent to be deducted from the
8 periodic rent of the dwelling unit; and
9 (b) Is based on the extent to which a condition of the premises
10 which violates the provisions of this chapter or a rental agreement
11 impairs the use and enjoyment of the dwelling unit by the tenant.
12 Sec. 4. 1. If a tenant provides written notice to a landlord
13 pursuant to subsection 1 of NRS 118A.355 and the landlord fails
14 to remedy a failure to maintain the dwelling unit in a habitable
15 condition within the time prescribed in NRS 118A.355, the tenant
16 may file a verified complaint for expedited relief with the court.
17 Upon filing a verified complaint pursuant to this subsection, a
18 tenant may withhold any rent that becomes due without incurring
19 late fees, charges for notice or any other charge or fee authorized
20 by this chapter or the rental agreement.
21 2. A verified complaint filed pursuant to subsection 1 must
22 state:
23 (a) The manner in which the tenant provided notice of each
24 failure to the landlord;
25 (b) The date on which the tenant provided notice of each
26 failure to the landlord;
27 (c) An estimate of what the tenant believes is the loss of value;
28 (d) A description of each failure which is the subject of the
29 notice; and
30 (e) Whether the tenant is withholding rent.
31 3. A verified complaint filed pursuant to subsection 1:
32 (a) May be consolidated with any action for summary eviction
33 or unlawful detainer that is already pending between the landlord
34 and tenant.
35 (b) May be raised as a defense in an action for summary
36 eviction or unlawful detainer.
37 4. The court shall conduct a hearing on a verified complaint
38 filed pursuant to subsection 1 not later than 7 calendar days after
39 the filing of the verified complaint unless the court determines that
40 good cause exists to extend such time. Before or at the scheduled
41 hearing, the tenant must provide to the court proof that the
42 landlord has been properly served with a copy of the verified
-
*AB223_R1*

1 complaint. Upon the hearing, if the court determines that the
2 landlord has violated the provisions of subsection 1 of NRS
3 118A.355, the court may:
4 (a) Order the landlord to remedy each failure specified in the
5 verified complaint;
6 (b) Award actual damages; and
7 (c) Enjoin the landlord from unlawfully removing the tenant
8 from the dwelling unit or excluding the tenant by blocking or
9 attempting to block the tenant’s entry upon the dwelling unit and,
10 if the circumstances so warrant:
11 (1) Hold the landlord in contempt of court; or
12 (2) Abate the rent owed by the tenant in total or in part, in
13 addition to any amount of rent owed which is reduced pursuant to
14 subsection 5.
15 5. If a tenant has withheld rent pursuant to subsection 1, the
16 court shall determine the amount of rent that the tenant owes to
17 the landlord during the period of time in which one or more
18 failures specified in the verified complaint exist by subtracting the
19 loss of value from the rent owed by the tenant pursuant to the
20 rental agreement. The court may order that any such rent which is
21 currently owed by the tenant or will be owed by the tenant be
22 placed into an escrow account which is maintained or approved by
23 the court. A landlord is not eligible to receive any money placed
24 into an escrow account pursuant to this subsection until the
25 landlord submits to the court evidence that the failure has been
26 remedied.
27 6. The payment of all costs and fees must be deferred for any
28 tenant who files a verified complaint for expedited relief pursuant
29 to this section. After any hearing and not later than the final
30 disposition of the filing or order, the court shall assess the costs
31 and fees against the party that does not prevail, except that the
32 court may reduce or waive the costs and fees, as justice may
33 require.

30 display of the flag of the United States, as set forth in

32 4. In addition to the provisions required by subsection 3, any
33 written rental agreement for a single-family residence which is not
34 signed by an authorized agent of the landlord who at the time of
35 signing holds a permit to engage in property management pursuant
36 to chapter 645 of NRS must contain a disclosure at the top of the
37 first page of the agreement, in a font size at least two times larger
38 than any other font size in the agreement, which states that:
39 (a) There are rebuttable presumptions in NRS 205.0813 and
40 205.0817 that the tenant does not have lawful occupancy of the
41 dwelling unless the agreement:
42 (1) Is notarized or is signed by an authorized agent of the

9 (2) Includes the current address , electronic mail address and
10 telephone number of the landlord or his or her authorized

24 and any provision in an agreement which contravenes the provisions
25 of this section is void.
26 7. As used in this section, “single-family residence” means a
27 structure that is comprised of not more than four units. The term
28 does not include a manufactured home as defined in
29 NRS 118B.015.
30 Sec. 7. (Deleted by amendment.)
31 Sec. 8. NRS 118A.250 is hereby amended to read as follows:
32 118A.250 1. The landlord shall deliver to the tenant upon the
33 tenant’s request a signed written receipt for the security deposit or
34 surety bond, or a combination thereof, and any other payments,

36 the landlord. The tenant may refuse to make rent payments until the
37 landlord tenders the requested receipt.

1 2. The landlord and tenant may agree that the tenant is to
2 perform specified repairs, maintenance tasks and minor remodeling
3 only if:
4 (a) The agreement of the parties is entered into in good faith;
5 and
6 (b) The agreement does not diminish the obligations of the
7 landlord to other tenants in the premises.
8 3. An agreement pursuant to subsection 2 is not entered into in
9 good faith if the landlord has a duty under subsection 1 to perform
10 the specified repairs, maintenance tasks or minor remodeling and
11 the tenant enters into the agreement because the landlord or his or
12 her agent has refused to perform them.
13 4. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 5, the landlord
14 shall not require a tenant to pay any fee or other charge for the
15 performance of any repairs, maintenance tasks or other work for
16 which the landlord has a duty under subsection 1 to perform,
17 including, without limitation, any fee or other charge to cover the
18 costs of any deductible or copayment under a policy of insurance for
19 home protection or service contract for the performance of any such
20 repairs, maintenance tasks or other work.
21 5. The landlord may require a tenant to pay any fee or other
22 charge for the performance of any repairs, maintenance tasks or

27 recovery of possession of the dwelling unit in violation of
28 NRS 118A.480.
29 5. A verified complaint for expedited relief [:
30 (a) Must be filed with the court within 5 judicial days after the
31 date of the unlawful act by the landlord, and the verified complaint
32 must be dismissed if it is not timely filed. If the verified complaint
33 for expedited relief is dismissed pursuant to this paragraph, the
34 tenant retains the right to pursue all other available remedies against
35 the landlord.
36 (b) May] may be consolidated with any action for summary
37 eviction or unlawful detainer that is already pending between the
38 landlord and tenant.

39 addition to the remedy provided in NRS 40.2512 and 40.290 to
40 40.420, inclusive, when the tenant of any dwelling, apartment,
41 mobile home or recreational vehicle with periodic rent reserved by
42 the month or any shorter period is in default in payment of the rent,
43 the landlord or the landlord’s agent may cause to be served a notice
44 in writing, requiring in the alternative the payment of the rent or the
45 surrender of the premises:

1 (a) Before the close of business on the seventh judicial day
2 following the day of service; or
3 (b) If the landlord chooses not to proceed in the manner set forth
4 in paragraph (a) and the rent is reserved by a period of 1 week or
5 less and the tenancy has not continued for more than 45 days, at or

28 the premises, that the landlord or the landlord’s agent informed the
29 tenant of the provisions of this section which set forth the lawful
30 procedures for eviction from a short-term tenancy. Upon
31 acceptance, the sheriff or constable shall serve the notice within 48
32 hours after the request for service was made by the landlord or the

42 (2) That if the court determines that the tenant is guilty of an

8 entry upon the premises or willfully or negligently interrupts or
9 causes or permits the interruption of an essential service required by
10 the rental agreement or chapter 118A of NRS.
11 4. If the tenant files such an affidavit at or before the time
12 stated in the notice, the landlord or the landlord’s agent, after receipt
13 of a file-stamped copy of the affidavit which was filed, shall not
14 provide for the nonadmittance of the tenant to the premises by
15 locking or otherwise.
16 5. Upon noncompliance with the notice:
17 (a) The landlord or the landlord’s agent may apply by affidavit
18 of complaint for eviction to the justice court of the township in
19 which the dwelling, apartment, mobile home or recreational vehicle
20 are located or to the district court of the county in which the

41 (b) Except when the tenant has timely filed the affidavit

43 received by the landlord or the landlord’s agent, and except when
44 the landlord is prohibited pursuant to NRS 118A.480, the landlord
-
*AB223_R1*

– 19 –
1 or the landlord’s agent may, in a peaceable manner, provide for the
2 nonadmittance of the tenant to the premises by locking or otherwise.
3 6. Upon the filing by the tenant of the affidavit permitted in
4 subsection 3, regardless of the information contained in the
5 affidavit, and the filing by the landlord of the affidavit permitted by
6 subsection 5, the justice court or the district court shall hold a
7 hearing, after service of notice of the hearing upon the parties, to
8 determine the truthfulness and sufficiency of any affidavit or notice
9 provided for in this section. If the court determines that there is no
10 legal defense as to the alleged unlawful detainer and the tenant is
11 guilty of an unlawful detainer, the court may issue a summary order
12 for removal of the tenant or an order providing for the
13 nonadmittance of the tenant. If the court determines that there is a
14 legal defense as to the alleged unlawful detainer, the court shall
15 refuse to grant either party any relief, and, except as otherwise
16 provided in this subsection, shall require that any further
17 proceedings be conducted pursuant to NRS 40.290 to 40.420,
18 inclusive. The issuance of a summary order for removal of the
19 tenant does not preclude an action by the tenant for any damages or
20 other relief to which the tenant may be entitled. If the alleged
21 unlawful detainer was based upon subsection 5 of NRS 40.2514, the
22 refusal by the court to grant relief does not preclude the landlord
23 thereafter from pursuing an action for unlawful detainer in
24 accordance with NRS 40.251.
25 7. The tenant may, upon payment of the appropriate fees
26 relating to the filing and service of a motion, file a motion with the
27 court, on a form provided by the clerk of the court, to dispute the
28 amount of the costs, if any, claimed by the landlord pursuant to NRS
29 118A.460 for the inventory, moving and storage of personal
30 property left on the premises. The motion must be filed within 20
31 days after the summary order for removal of the tenant or the
32 abandonment of the premises by the tenant, or within 20 days after:
33 (a) The tenant has vacated or been removed from the premises;
34 and
35 (b) A copy of those charges has been requested by or provided
36 to the tenant,
37  whichever is later.
38 8. Upon the filing of a motion pursuant to subsection 7, the
39 court shall schedule a hearing on the motion. The hearing must be
40 held within 10 days after the filing of the motion. The court shall
41 affix the date of the hearing to the motion and order a copy served
42 upon the landlord by the sheriff, constable or other process server.
43 At the hearing, the court may:
44 (a) Determine the costs, if any, claimed by the landlord pursuant
45 to NRS 118A.460 and any accumulating daily costs; and
-
*AB223_R1*

– 20 –
1 (b) Order the release of the tenant’s property upon the payment
2 of the charges determined to be due or if no charges are determined
3 to be due.
4 9. The tenant may, upon payment of the appropriate fees
5 relating to the filing and service of a motion, file a motion with the
6 court on a form provided by the clerk of court to dispute the
7 reasonableness of the actions of a landlord pursuant to subsection 3
8 of NRS 118A.460. The motion must be filed within 5 days after the
9 tenant has vacated or been removed from the premises. Upon the
10 filing of a motion pursuant to this subsection, the court shall
11 schedule a hearing on the motion. The hearing must be held within 5
12 days after the filing of the motion. The court shall affix the date of
13 the hearing to the motion and order a copy served upon the landlord
14 by the sheriff, constable or other process server. At the hearing, the
15 court may:
16 (a) Order the landlord to allow the retrieval of the tenant’s
17 essential personal effects at the date and time and for a period
18 necessary for the retrieval, as determined by the court; and
19 (b) Award damages in an amount not greater than $2,500.
20 10. In determining the amount of damages, if any, to be
21 awarded under paragraph (b) of subsection 9, the court shall
22 consider:
23 (a) Whether the landlord acted in good faith;
24 (b) The course of conduct between the landlord and the tenant;
25 and
26 (c) The degree of harm to the tenant caused by the landlord’s
27 conduct.
28 11. A landlord shall not refuse to accept rent from a tenant that
29 is submitted after the landlord or the landlord’s agent has served or
30 had served a notice pursuant to subsection 1 if the refusal is based
31 on the fact that the tenant has not paid collection fees, attorney’s

3 Sec. 17. NRS 439.479 is hereby amended to read as follows:
4 439.479 1. In addition to any other powers, duties and
5 authority conferred on a district board of health, the district board of
6 health may by affirmative vote of a majority of all the members of
7 the board adopt regulations consistent with law, which must take
8 effect immediately on their approval by the State Board of Health,
9 to:
10 (a) Regulate any health hazard on residential property;
11 (b) Regulate any health hazard in a rental dwelling unit; and
12 (c) Regulate any health hazard on commercial property.
13 2. The district board of health may adopt regulations to ensure
14 the enforcement of laws that protect the public health and safety
15 associated with the condition of rental dwelling units and to recover
16 all costs incurred by the district board of health relating thereto. Any
17 regulation adopted pursuant to this subsection must be provided by
18 the landlord of a rental dwelling unit to a tenant upon request to
19 ensure that the landlord and the tenant understand their respective
20 rights and responsibilities clearly.
21 3. In carrying out its duties relating to the protection of the
22 public health and safety associated with the condition of rental
23 dwelling units, the district board of health may:
24 (a) Take any enforcement action it determines necessary; and
25 (b) Establish an administrative hearing process, including,
26 without limitation, the hiring of qualified hearing officers.
27 4. If a tenant of a rental dwelling unit provides written notice to
28 the landlord pursuant to NRS 118A.355 specifying a failure by the
29 landlord to maintain the dwelling unit in a habitable condition and
30 requesting that the landlord remedy the failure and the landlord fails
31 to remedy the failure [or to make a reasonable effort to do so] within
32 the time prescribed in NRS 118A.355, the tenant may, in addition to
33 any remedy provided in NRS 118A.355 [,] or section 4 of this act,
34 provide to the district board of health a copy of the written notice
35 that the tenant provided to the landlord. If, upon inspection of the
36 dwelling unit, the district board of health determines that either the
37 landlord or the tenant has failed to maintain the dwelling unit in a
38 habitable condition, the district board of health may refer the matter
39 to the administrative hearing process if established pursuant to
40 subsection 3 or take any action with respect to the dwelling unit
41 which is authorized by this section or the regulations adopted
42 pursuant thereto.
43 5. Before the adoption, amendment or repeal of a regulation,
44 the district board of health must give at least 30 days’ notice of its
45 intended action. The notice must:

2 proposal or a description of the subjects and issues involved and of
3 the time when, the place where and the manner in which interested
4 persons may present their views thereon;
5 (b) State each address at which the text of the proposal may be
6 inspected and copied; and
7 (c) Be mailed to all persons who have requested in writing that
8 they be placed on a mailing list, which must be kept by the board for
9 such purpose.
10 6. All interested persons must be afforded a reasonable
11 opportunity to submit data, views or arguments, orally or in writing,
12 on the intended action to adopt, amend or repeal the regulation.
13 With respect to substantive regulations, the district board of health
14 shall set a time and place for an oral public hearing, but if no one
15 appears who will be directly affected by the proposal and requests
16 an oral hearing, the district board of health may proceed
17 immediately to act upon any written submissions. The district board
18 of health shall consider fully all written and oral submissions
19 respecting the proposal.
20 7. The district board of health shall file a copy of all of its
21 adopted regulations with the county clerk.
22 8. As used in this section:
23 (a) “Commercial property” means any real property which is not
24 used as a dwelling unit and is not occupied as, or designed or
25 intended for occupancy as, a residence or sleeping place.
26 (b) “Dwelling unit” has the meaning ascribed to it in
27 NRS 118A.080.
28 (c) “Health hazard” means any biological, physical or chemical
29 exposure, condition or public nuisance that may adversely affect the
30 health of a person.
