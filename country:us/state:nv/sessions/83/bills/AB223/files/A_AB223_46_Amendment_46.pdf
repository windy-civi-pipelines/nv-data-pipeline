Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 [Sections 2 and] Section 3 of this bill [define] defines the [terms “actual damages” and
2 “diminution] term “loss of [the value of a dwelling unit”] value” for purposes of the
3 provisions set forth in existing law governing the relationship between landlords and tenants.
4 (Chapter 118A of NRS)
5 Existing law requires a written rental agreement to contain provisions relating to certain
6 subjects, including [, without limitation: (1) the amount of rent and the manner and time of its
7 payment; (2) fees which are required and the purposes for which they are required; and (3)]
8 certain information concerning the contact information of the landlord or his or her authorized
9 representative. (NRS 118A.200) Section 6 of this bill [: (1) requires such provisions relating
10 to rent to include information concerning the requirements set forth in sections 7 and 8 of this
11 bill; and (2)] requires the electronic mail address of the landlord or his or her authorized
12 representative to be included in [certain] such provisions. [Section 6 additionally requires: (1)
13 the provision relating to fees to instead require information concerning any fees which are
14 required to be paid or may be incurred by a tenant and the purposes for which they are

Assembly Amendment No. 46 to Assembly Bill No. 223 Page 4
15 required or reasons that they may be incurred; and (2) such information to be listed on a single
16 sheet of paper immediately after certain information that existing law requires to be on the
17 first page of the written rental agreement.]
18 Existing law provides that the absence of a written agreement raises certain disputable
19 presumptions, including a presumption that maintenance and waste removal services are
20 provided without charge to the tenant. (NRS 118A.200) Section 6 additionally includes the
21 provision of utility services at no charge to the tenant in such a presumption.
22 Existing law sets forth certain provisions governing the payment of rent by a tenant and
23 the delivery of certain signed written receipts to a tenant. (NRS 118A.210, 118A.250)
24 [Section 7 requires a landlord to accept, at no charge to the tenant, at least one of the
25 following methods of payment for rent: (1) money order; (2) personal check; (3) cashier’s
26 check; or (4) cash.] Section 8 of this bill requires a landlord to provide a written receipt to a
27 tenant upon the receipt of [any] each payment of rent.
28 Existing law requires a landlord, at all times during a tenancy, to maintain a dwelling unit
29 in a habitable condition and provides that a dwelling unit is not habitable if it violates
30 provisions of certain housing or health codes or if it substantially lacks certain things,
31 including floors, walls, ceilings, stairways and railings which are maintained in good repair.
32 (NRS 118A.290) Section 9 of this bill additionally provides that a dwelling unit is not
33 habitable if it substantially lacks: (1) doors and windows which are maintained in good repair;
34 (2) effective measures in place to control the presence of rodents, insects and vermin; (3)
35 effective measures in place to prevent exposure to unsafe levels of radon, lead paint, asbestos,
36 toxic mold and other hazardous substances; (4) in the dwelling unit and any other part of the
37 areas on the premises under the landlord’s control, locks which are maintained in good repair
38 on all exterior doors and all windows which are capable of being opened; and (5) safety
39 equipment which is required by law to be included in the dwelling unit maintained in good
40 working order.
41 Existing law requires, if a landlord fails to comply with a rental agreement, a tenant to
42 deliver a written notice to the landlord specifying the acts and omissions constituting the
43 breach and stating that the rental agreement will be terminated. Existing law further
44 authorizes, if the landlord fails to remedy the breach or make a reasonable effort to do so
45 within 14 days after receipt of the notice, a tenant to: (1) terminate the rental agreement
46 immediately; (2) recover actual damages; and (3) apply to the court for such relief as the court
47 deems proper under the circumstances. (NRS 118A.350) Section 10 of this bill authorizes the
48 tenant to terminate the rental agreement without incurring any fee which is assessed by the
49 landlord for the early termination of a rental agreement and authorizes the tenant to
50 additionally provide the landlord with written notice of the intent of the tenant to terminate the
51 rental agreement on a date which is not later than 60 days after the date the notice is provided
52 to the landlord. Sections 11 and 12 of this bill similarly authorize tenants whose landlords
53 have failed to maintain a dwelling unit in a habitable condition or supply essential items and
54 services to terminate a rental agreement in this manner. (NRS 118A.355, 118A.380)
55 Existing law further prohibits a tenant from taking certain remedial actions if the breach
56 is remediable and the landlord adequately remedies the breach or uses his or her best efforts to
57 remedy the breach within 14 days after receipt of the notice. (NRS 118A.350) Section 10
58 instead provides that a tenant is prohibited from taking such remedial actions if the breach is
59 remediable and the landlord remedies the breach within the prescribed time. Existing law
60 additionally prohibits a tenant from taking such remedial actions unless the tenant has
61 provided the landlord with certain notice but authorizes the tenant to recover actual damages
62 without such notice if the landlord: (1) admits to the court that the landlord had knowledge of
63 the condition constituting the breach; or (2) has received written notice of that condition from
64 a governmental agency authorized to inspect for violations of building, housing or health
65 codes. (NRS 118A.350) Section 10 instead authorizes the tenant to recover actual damages
66 without providing such notice if the landlord: (1) received written notice of that condition
67 from such a governmental agency; or (2) had actual knowledge of the condition constituting
68 the breach. Sections 11 and 12 similarly, for tenants whose landlords have failed to maintain
69 a dwelling unit in a habitable condition or supply essential items and services: (1) remove
70 language which would prohibit such tenants from taking certain remedial actions if the
71 landlord has failed to adequately remedy the failure or used his or her best efforts to remedy
72 the concern; and (2) revise the circumstances under which a tenant is authorized to take
73 certain remedial actions without providing notice. (NRS 118A.355, 118A.380)

Assembly Amendment No. 46 to Assembly Bill No. 223 Page 5
74 Existing law authorizes a tenant whose landlord has failed to maintain a dwelling unit in a
75 habitable condition to take certain remedial actions if a landlord fails to adequately remedy the
76 failure or use his or her best efforts to remedy the failure within a certain period of time. (NRS
77 118A.355) Section 4 of this bill authorizes a tenant, in addition to such remedial actions, to
78 file a verified complaint for expedited relief with the court [within 15 judicial days after the
79 failure of the landlord to remedy the failure] and sets forth procedures relating to the filing,
80 hearing and disposition of such a verified complaint. Section 4 also: (1) authorizes a tenant
81 who files such a verified complaint to withhold any rent that becomes due without incurring
82 late fees, charges for notice or certain other charges until the landlord has remedied the
83 failure; (2) authorizes the court to order that such rent be placed into an escrow account which
84 is maintained or approved by the court; and (3) requires the payment of all costs and official
85 fees for any tenant who files such a verified complaint to be deferred and later assessed
86 against the party that does not prevail. Section 17 of this bill authorizes a tenant to provide a
87 copy of the notice provided to a landlord to a district board of health for purposes of certain
88 provisions relating to the inspection of and administrative proceedings concerning health
89 hazards, in addition to any remedy provided in section 4.
90 Existing law further requires justice courts to establish by local rule a mechanism by
91 which tenants that withhold rent under such circumstances may deposit such rent into an
92 escrow account maintained or approved by the court. (NRS 118A.355) Section 11: (1)
93 requires such rules to additionally provide for the deposit of rent withheld pursuant to section
94 4; and (2) prohibits a court from releasing any money deposited into such accounts until the
95 time period to file an appeal has run.
96 Existing law authorizes, under certain circumstances, a tenant to withhold any rent
97 that becomes due without incurring certain charges until the landlord has remedied, or
98 has attempted in good faith to remedy, certain failures to maintain a dwelling in a
99 habitable condition. Existing law further provides that a tenant who takes such actions
100 does not have a defense to an eviction unless the tenant has deposited the withheld rent
101 into an escrow account maintained or approved by the court. (NRS 118A.355) Section 11
102 instead provides that a tenant does not have such a defense unless: (1) he or she has
103 deposited the withheld rent minus any applicable loss of value, into such an escrow
104 account; or (2) the court determines, at the time of the hearing, that the tenant has
105 otherwise retained or is capable of paying the withheld rent minus any applicable loss of
106 value.
107 Existing law additionally prohibits a tenant whose landlord has failed to maintain a
108 dwelling unit in a habitable condition from taking certain remedial actions if the condition was
109 caused by the tenant’s own deliberate or negligent act or omission or that of a member of his
110 or her household or other person on the premises with his or her consent. (NRS 118A.355)
111 Section 11 prohibits such a tenant from taking such remedial actions, including filing a
112 verified complaint for expedited relief pursuant to section 4, if the condition was proven, by
113 clear and convincing evidence, to have been caused by the tenant’s own deliberate or
114 negligent act or omission or that of a member of his or her household or other person on the
115 premises with his or her consent who is not another tenant, or guest thereof, [who is] on the
116 premises pursuant to a separate rental agreement. Section 12 similarly prohibits a tenant
117 whose landlord has willfully or negligently failed to supply essential items or services from
118 taking certain remedial actions under such circumstances. (NRS 118A.380)
119 Existing law authorizes a tenant to take certain remedial actions if his or her landlord
120 willfully or negligently fails to supply essential items or services and by doing so, caused the
121 premises to become unfit for habitation. Existing law further provides a nonexhaustive list of
122 certain items and services which constitute essential items or services, including, heat, air-
123 conditioning, running water, hot water, electricity, gas and a functioning door lock. (NRS
124 118A.380) Section 12 includes in such a list a functioning window lock and functional safety
125 equipment.
126 Existing law authorizes a tenant to take certain actions and recover actual damages or an
127 amount not greater than $2,500 which is fixed by a court, or both, if a landlord: (1) unlawfully
128 removes the tenant from the premises or excludes the tenant by blocking or attempting to
129 block the tenant’s entry upon the premises; (2) willfully interrupts or causes or permits the
130 interruption of any essential item or service required by the rental agreement or by law; or (3)
131 recovers possession of the dwelling unit under certain other circumstances which are
132 prohibited by existing law. (NRS 118A.390) Section 13 of this bill: (1) revises the monetary

Assembly Amendment No. 46 to Assembly Bill No. 223 Page 6
133 amount that a tenant is authorized to recover by instead providing that the tenant is authorized
134 to recover an amount which is three times the periodic rent or the tenant’s actual damages,
135 whichever is greater; and (2) additionally authorizes such remedial measures in circumstances
136 where a landlord negligently interrupts or causes or permits the interruption of any essential
137 item or service required by the rental agreement or by law. Section 15 of this bill makes a
138 conforming change to make the revisions made by section 13 inapplicable to provisions
139 governing liability of a landlord who unlawfully retains the household goods or personal
140 property of a tenant. (NRS 118A.520) Section 16 of this bill makes a conforming change to
141 require certain notices provided to a tenant to include notice of the ability of the tenant to seek
142 relief if a landlord negligently interrupts or causes or permits the interruption of any essential
143 item or service required by the rental agreement or by law. (NRS 40.253)
144 Section 13: (1) requires a landlord to provide a tenant who terminates his or her rental
145 agreement under certain circumstances to provide the tenant with a reasonable length of time
146 to gather his or her belongings; (2) provides that a landlord who was provided notice by a
147 tenant which specified the willful or negligent failure to supply essential items or services and
148 failed to remedy the breach is presumed to have negligently caused the interruption of the
149 essential items [and] or services; and (3) provides that a landlord may overcome such a
150 presumption by showing clear and convincing evidence that the restoration could not be
151 accomplished within the notice period. Finally, section 13 [extends] removes the [length of
152 time] requirement for a tenant to file certain verified complaints for expedited relief with the
153 court [from] 5 judicial days after the last date of the unlawful act by the landlord . [to 15
154 judicial days after the last date on which the unlawful conduct of the landlord occurred.] (NRS
155 118A.390)
156 Existing law: (1) requires a landlord, or any person authorized to enter into a rental
157 agreement on his or her behalf, to disclose certain information to a tenant in writing before the
158 commencement of a tenancy or to post such information in certain areas; and (2) authorizes a
159 tenant to recover actual damages or $25, whichever is greater, after a demand if the landlord
160 fails to make such disclosures or postings. (NRS 118A.260, 118A.270, 118A.410) Section 14
161 of this bill instead provides that a tenant is authorized to recover actual damages or an amount
162 equal to [1 month] 5 percent of the periodic rent, whichever is greater, under such
163 circumstances.
164 Section 5 of this bill makes a conforming change to indicate the placement of [sections 2
165 and] section 3 in the Nevada Revised Statutes.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

8 attorney’s fees or any business expenses which are charged on a pro rata basis
9 pursuant to the provisions of a rental agreement.] (Deleted by amendment.)

12 the court with or without expert testimony,] :

15 (b) Is based on the extent to which a condition of the premises which violates
16 the provisions of this chapter or a rental agreement impairs the use and
17 enjoyment of the dwelling unit by the tenant.

Assembly Amendment No. 46 to Assembly Bill No. 223 Page 7
1 Sec. 4. 1. If a tenant provides written notice to a landlord pursuant to

8 rental agreement.
9 2. A verified complaint filed pursuant to subsection 1 must state:
10 (a) The manner in which the tenant provided notice of each failure to the
11 landlord;
12 (b) The date on which the tenant provided notice of each failure to the
13 landlord;

23 against the landlord.
24 (b)] May be consolidated with any action for summary eviction or unlawful
25 detainer that is already pending between the landlord and tenant.
26 [(c)] (b) May be raised as a defense in an action for summary eviction or
27 unlawful detainer.
28 4. The court shall conduct a hearing on a verified complaint filed pursuant
29 to subsection 1 not later than 7 [judicial] calendar days after the filing of the
30 verified complaint [.] unless the court determines that good cause exists to extend
31 such time. Before or at the scheduled hearing, the tenant must provide to the
32 court proof that the landlord has been properly served with a copy of the verified
33 complaint. Upon the hearing, if the court determines that the landlord has

36 complaint;
37 (b) Award actual damages; and

49 may order that any such rent which is currently owed by the tenant or will be
50 owed by the tenant be placed into an escrow account which is maintained or
51 approved by the court. A landlord is not eligible to receive any money placed into
52 an escrow account pursuant to this subsection until the landlord submits to the
53 court evidence that the failure has been remedied.

Assembly Amendment No. 46 to Assembly Bill No. 223 Page 8

2 files a verified complaint for expedited relief pursuant to this section. After any
3 hearing and not later than the final disposition of the filing or order, the court

20 relating to the following subjects:
21 (a) Duration of the agreement.
22 (b) Amount of rent and the manner and time of its payment . [, which must
23 include, without limitation, information concerning:

28 (c) Occupancy by children or pets.

50 agreement for a single-family residence which is not signed by an authorized agent
51 of the landlord who at the time of signing holds a permit to engage in property
52 management pursuant to chapter 645 of NRS must contain a disclosure at the top of

Assembly Amendment No. 46 to Assembly Bill No. 223 Page 9
1 the first page of the agreement, in a font size at least two times larger than any other
2 font size in the agreement, which states that:
3 (a) There are rebuttable presumptions in NRS 205.0813 and 205.0817 that the
4 tenant does not have lawful occupancy of the dwelling unless the agreement:
5 (1) Is notarized or is signed by an authorized agent of the landlord who at
6 the time of signing holds a permit to engage in property management pursuant to
7 chapter 645 of NRS; and
8 (2) Includes the current address , electronic mail address and telephone
9 number of the landlord or his or her authorized representative; and
10 (b) The agreement is valid and enforceable against the landlord and the tenant

18 subsection 3 to be included in a written rental agreement must be listed on a
19 single sheet of paper immediately after the information required pursuant to

23 (b) Maintenance , utility and waste removal services are provided without
24 charge to the tenant.
25 (c) No charges for partial or late payments of rent or for dishonored checks are
26 paid by the tenant.

28 condition as when the tenancy began.
29 6. [7.] It is unlawful for a landlord or any person authorized to enter into a
30 rental agreement on his or her behalf to use any written agreement which does not
31 conform to the provisions of this section, and any provision in an agreement which
32 contravenes the provisions of this section is void.
33 7. [8.] As used in this section, “single-family residence” means a structure
34 that is comprised of not more than four units. The term does not include a
35 manufactured home as defined in NRS 118B.015.

47 tenancy is from month to month.
48 [3.] 4. In the absence of an agreement, either written or oral:
49 (a) Rent is payable at the beginning of the tenancy; and
50 (b) Rent for the use and occupancy of a dwelling is the fair rental value for the
51 use and occupancy.
52 [4.] 5. A landlord may charge a reasonable late fee for the late payment of

Assembly Amendment No. 46 to Assembly Bill No. 223 Page 10
1 (a) In a tenancy that is longer than week to week, no late fee may be charged or
2 imposed until at least 3 calendar days after the date that rent is due;

33 notice to the landlord specifying the breach. If the landlord does not [adequately]
34 remedy the breach [, or use his or her best efforts to remedy the breach] within 48
35 hours, except a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, after it is received by the

23 expedited relief. Upon the hearing, if it is determined that the landlord has violated
24 any of the provisions of subsection 1, the court may:
25 (a) Order the landlord to restore to the tenant the premises or essential items or
26 services, or both;
27 (b) Award damages pursuant to subsection 1; and

4 the landlord or the landlord’s agent, after receipt of a file-stamped copy of the
5 affidavit which was filed, shall not provide for the nonadmittance of the tenant to
6 the premises by locking or otherwise.

34 for the nonadmittance of the tenant to the premises by locking or otherwise.
35 6. Upon the filing by the tenant of the affidavit permitted in subsection 3,
36 regardless of the information contained in the affidavit, and the filing by the

39 determine the truthfulness and sufficiency of any affidavit or notice provided for in

41 unlawful detainer and the tenant is guilty of an unlawful detainer, the court may
42 issue a summary order for removal of the tenant or an order providing for the
43 nonadmittance of the tenant. If the court determines that there is a legal defense as
44 to the alleged unlawful detainer, the court shall refuse to grant either party any
45 relief, and, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, shall require that any
46 further proceedings be conducted pursuant to NRS 40.290 to 40.420, inclusive. The
47 issuance of a summary order for removal of the tenant does not preclude an action
48 by the tenant for any damages or other relief to which the tenant may be entitled. If
49 the alleged unlawful detainer was based upon subsection 5 of NRS 40.2514, the
50 refusal by the court to grant relief does not preclude the landlord thereafter from
51 pursuing an action for unlawful detainer in accordance with NRS 40.251.
52 7. The tenant may, upon payment of the appropriate fees relating to the filing
53 and service of a motion, file a motion with the court, on a form provided by the

Assembly Amendment No. 46 to Assembly Bill No. 223 Page 18
1 clerk of the court, to dispute the amount of the costs, if any, claimed by the landlord
2 pursuant to NRS 118A.460 for the inventory, moving and storage of personal
3 property left on the premises. The motion must be filed within 20 days after the
4 summary order for removal of the tenant or the abandonment of the premises by the
5 tenant, or within 20 days after:
6 (a) The tenant has vacated or been removed from the premises; and
7 (b) A copy of those charges has been requested by or provided to the tenant,
8  whichever is later.
9 8. Upon the filing of a motion pursuant to subsection 7, the court shall
10 schedule a hearing on the motion. The hearing must be held within 10 days after the
11 filing of the motion. The court shall affix the date of the hearing to the motion and
12 order a copy served upon the landlord by the sheriff, constable or other process
13 server. At the hearing, the court may:
14 (a) Determine the costs, if any, claimed by the landlord pursuant to NRS
15 118A.460 and any accumulating daily costs; and
16 (b) Order the release of the tenant’s property upon the payment of the charges
17 determined to be due or if no charges are determined to be due.
18 9. The tenant may, upon payment of the appropriate fees relating to the filing
19 and service of a motion, file a motion with the court on a form provided by the
20 clerk of court to dispute the reasonableness of the actions of a landlord pursuant to
21 subsection 3 of NRS 118A.460. The motion must be filed within 5 days after the
22 tenant has vacated or been removed from the premises. Upon the filing of a motion
23 pursuant to this subsection, the court shall schedule a hearing on the motion. The
24 hearing must be held within 5 days after the filing of the motion. The court shall
25 affix the date of the hearing to the motion and order a copy served upon the
26 landlord by the sheriff, constable or other process server. At the hearing, the court
27 may:
28 (a) Order the landlord to allow the retrieval of the tenant’s essential personal
29 effects at the date and time and for a period necessary for the retrieval, as
30 determined by the court; and
31 (b) Award damages in an amount not greater than $2,500.
32 10. In determining the amount of damages, if any, to be awarded under
33 paragraph (b) of subsection 9, the court shall consider:
34 (a) Whether the landlord acted in good faith;
35 (b) The course of conduct between the landlord and the tenant; and
36 (c) The degree of harm to the tenant caused by the landlord’s conduct.
37 11. A landlord shall not refuse to accept rent from a tenant that is submitted
38 after the landlord or the landlord’s agent has served or had served a notice pursuant
39 to subsection 1 if the refusal is based on the fact that the tenant has not paid
40 collection fees, attorney’s fees or other costs other than rent, a reasonable charge
41 for late payments of rent or dishonored checks, or a security deposit. As used in this
42 subsection, “security deposit” has the meaning ascribed to it in NRS 118A.240.
43 12. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 118A.315, this section does not
44 apply to:
45 (a) The tenant of a mobile home lot in a mobile home park or to the tenant of a
46 recreational vehicle lot in an area of a mobile home park in this State other than an
47 area designated as a recreational vehicle lot pursuant to the provisions of subsection
48 8 of NRS 40.215.
49 (b) A tenant who provides proof to the landlord that he or she is a federal
50 worker, tribal worker, state worker or household member of such a worker during a
51 shutdown.
52 13. As used in this section, “close of business” means the close of business of
53 the court that has jurisdiction over the matter.

Assembly Amendment No. 46 to Assembly Bill No. 223 Page 19
1 Sec. 17. NRS 439.479 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 439.479 1. In addition to any other powers, duties and authority conferred
3 on a district board of health, the district board of health may by affirmative vote of
4 a majority of all the members of the board adopt regulations consistent with law,
5 which must take effect immediately on their approval by the State Board of Health,
6 to:
7 (a) Regulate any health hazard on residential property;
8 (b) Regulate any health hazard in a rental dwelling unit; and
9 (c) Regulate any health hazard on commercial property.
10 2. The district board of health may adopt regulations to ensure the
11 enforcement of laws that protect the public health and safety associated with the
12 condition of rental dwelling units and to recover all costs incurred by the district
13 board of health relating thereto. Any regulation adopted pursuant to this subsection
14 must be provided by the landlord of a rental dwelling unit to a tenant upon request
15 to ensure that the landlord and the tenant understand their respective rights and
16 responsibilities clearly.
17 3. In carrying out its duties relating to the protection of the public health and
18 safety associated with the condition of rental dwelling units, the district board of
19 health may:
20 (a) Take any enforcement action it determines necessary; and
21 (b) Establish an administrative hearing process, including, without limitation,
22 the hiring of qualified hearing officers.
23 4. If a tenant of a rental dwelling unit provides written notice to the landlord
24 pursuant to NRS 118A.355 specifying a failure by the landlord to maintain the
25 dwelling unit in a habitable condition and requesting that the landlord remedy the
26 failure and the landlord fails to remedy the failure [or to make a reasonable effort to
27 do so] within the time prescribed in NRS 118A.355, the tenant may, in addition to
28 any remedy provided in NRS 118A.355 [,] or section 4 of this act, provide to the
29 district board of health a copy of the written notice that the tenant provided to the
30 landlord. If, upon inspection of the dwelling unit, the district board of health
31 determines that either the landlord or the tenant has failed to maintain the dwelling
32 unit in a habitable condition, the district board of health may refer the matter to the
33 administrative hearing process if established pursuant to subsection 3 or take any
34 action with respect to the dwelling unit which is authorized by this section or the
35 regulations adopted pursuant thereto.
36 5. Before the adoption, amendment or repeal of a regulation, the district board
37 of health must give at least 30 days’ notice of its intended action. The notice must:
38 (a) Include a statement of either the terms or substance of the proposal or a
39 description of the subjects and issues involved and of the time when, the place
40 where and the manner in which interested persons may present their views thereon;
41 (b) State each address at which the text of the proposal may be inspected and
42 copied; and
43 (c) Be mailed to all persons who have requested in writing that they be placed
44 on a mailing list, which must be kept by the board for such purpose.
45 6. All interested persons must be afforded a reasonable opportunity to submit
46 data, views or arguments, orally or in writing, on the intended action to adopt,
47 amend or repeal the regulation. With respect to substantive regulations, the district
48 board of health shall set a time and place for an oral public hearing, but if no one
49 appears who will be directly affected by the proposal and requests an oral hearing,
50 the district board of health may proceed immediately to act upon any written
51 submissions. The district board of health shall consider fully all written and oral
52 submissions respecting the proposal.

Assembly Amendment No. 46 to Assembly Bill No. 223 Page 20
1 7. The district board of health shall file a copy of all of its adopted regulations
2 with the county clerk.
3 8. As used in this section:
4 (a) “Commercial property” means any real property which is not used as a
5 dwelling unit and is not occupied as, or designed or intended for occupancy as, a
6 residence or sleeping place.
7 (b) “Dwelling unit” has the meaning ascribed to it in NRS 118A.080.
8 (c) “Health hazard” means any biological, physical or chemical exposure,
9 condition or public nuisance that may adversely affect the health of a person.
10 Sec. 18. [The amendatory provisions of subsections 3 and 5 of NRS
11 118A.200, as amended by section 5 of this act, do not apply to a rental agreement
12 entered into before October 1, 2025. A landlord described in NRS 118A.200, as
13 amended by section 5 of this act, shall review the rental agreements of the landlord
14 that are in effect on October 1, 2025, to ensure compliance with the amendatory
15 provisions of this act and, on or before the date for renewal of such an agreement, if
16 necessary, revise the agreement to include the information required pursuant to
17 subsection 3 of NRS 118A.200, as amended by section 5 of this act, and reformat
18 the agreement to meet the requirements of subsection 5 of NRS 118A.200, as
19 amended by section 5 of this act.] (Deleted by amendment.)
