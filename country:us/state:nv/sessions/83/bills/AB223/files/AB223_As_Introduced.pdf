Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Sections 2 and 3 of this bill define the terms “actual damages” and “diminution
2 of the value of a dwelling unit” for purposes of the provisions set forth in existing
3 law governing the relationship between landlords and tenants. (Chapter 118A of
4 NRS)
5 Existing law requires a written rental agreement to contain provisions relating
6 to certain subjects, including, without limitation: (1) the amount of rent and the
-

– 2 –
7 manner and time of its payment; (2) fees which are required and the purposes for
8 which they are required; and (3) certain information concerning the contact
9 information of the landlord or his or her authorized representative. (NRS 118A.200)
10 Section 6 of this bill: (1) requires such provisions relating to rent to include
11 information concerning the requirements set forth in sections 7 and 8 of this bill;
12 and (2) requires the electronic mail address of the landlord or his or her authorized
13 representative to be included in certain provisions. Section 6 additionally requires:
14 (1) the provision relating to fees to instead require information concerning any fees
15 which are required to be paid or may be incurred by a tenant and the purposes for
16 which they are required or reasons that they may be incurred; and (2) such
17 information to be listed on a single sheet of paper immediately after certain
18 information that existing law requires to be on the first page of the written rental
19 agreement.
20 Existing law provides that the absence of a written agreement raises certain
21 disputable presumptions, including a presumption that maintenance and waste
22 removal services are provided without charge to the tenant. (NRS 118A.200)
23 Section 6 additionally includes the provision of utility services at no charge to the
24 tenant in such a presumption.
25 Existing law sets forth certain provisions governing the payment of rent by a
26 tenant and the delivery of certain signed written receipts to a tenant. (NRS
27 118A.210, 118A.250) Section 7 requires a landlord to accept, at no charge to the
28 tenant, at least one of the following methods of payment for rent: (1) money order;
29 (2) personal check; (3) cashier’s check; or (4) cash. Section 8 requires a landlord to
30 provide a written receipt to a tenant upon the receipt of any payment of rent.
31 Existing law requires a landlord, at all times during a tenancy, to maintain a
32 dwelling unit in habitable condition and provides that a dwelling unit is not
33 habitable if it violates provisions of certain housing or health codes or if it
34 substantially lacks certain things, including floors, walls, ceilings, stairways and
35 railings which are maintained in good repair. (NRS 118A.290) Section 9 of this bill
36 additionally provides that a dwelling unit is not habitable if it substantially lacks:
37 (1) doors and windows which are maintained in good repair; (2) effective measures
38 in place to control the presence of rodents, insects and vermin; (3) effective
39 measures in place to prevent exposure to unsafe levels of radon, lead paint,
40 asbestos, toxic mold and other hazardous substances; (4) in the dwelling unit and
41 any other part of the areas on the premises under the landlord’s control, locks which
42 are in good repair on all exterior doors and all windows which are capable of being
43 opened; and (5) safety equipment which is required by law to be included in the
44 dwelling unit maintained in good working order.
45 Existing law requires, if a landlord fails to comply with a rental agreement, a
46 tenant to deliver a written notice to the landlord specifying the acts and omissions
47 constituting the breach and stating that the rental agreement will be terminated.
48 Existing law further authorizes, if the landlord fails to remedy the breach or make a
49 reasonable effort to do so within 14 days after receipt of the notice, a tenant to: (1)
50 terminate the rental agreement immediately; (2) recover actual damages; and (3)
51 apply to the court for such relief as the court deems proper under the circumstances.
52 (NRS 118A.350) Section 10 of this bill authorizes the tenant to terminate the rental
53 agreement without incurring any fee which is assessed by the landlord for the early
54 termination of a rental agreement and authorizes the tenant to additionally provide
55 the landlord with written notice of the intent of the tenant to terminate the rental
56 agreement on a date which is not later than 60 days after the date the notice is
57 provided to the landlord. Sections 11 and 12 of this bill similarly authorize tenants
58 whose landlords have failed to maintain a dwelling unit in a habitable condition or
59 supply essential items and services to terminate a rental agreement in this manner.
60 (NRS 118A.355, 118A.380)

*AB223*

– 3 –
61 Existing law further prohibits a tenant from taking certain remedial actions if
62 the breach is remediable and the landlord adequately remedies the breach or uses
63 his or her best efforts to remedy the breach within 14 days after receipt of the
64 notice. (NRS 118A.350) Section 10 instead provides that a tenant is prohibited
65 from taking such remedial actions if the breach is remediable and the landlord
66 remedies the breach within the prescribed time. Existing law additionally prohibits
67 a tenant from taking such remedial actions unless the tenant has provided the
68 landlord with certain notice but authorizes the tenant to recover actual damages
69 without such notice if the landlord: (1) admits to the court that the landlord had
70 knowledge of the condition constituting the breach; or (2) has received written
71 notice of that condition from a governmental agency authorized to inspect for
72 violations of building, housing or health codes. (NRS 118A.350) Section 10 instead
73 authorizes the tenant to recover actual damages without providing such notice if the
74 landlord: (1) received written notice of that condition from such a governmental
75 agency; or (2) had actual knowledge of the condition constituting the breach.
76 Sections 11 and 12 similarly, for tenants whose landlords have failed to maintain a
77 dwelling unit in a habitable condition or supply essential items and services: (1)
78 remove language which would prohibit such tenants from taking certain remedial
79 actions if the landlord has failed to adequately remedy the failure or used his or her
80 best efforts to remedy the concern; and (2) revise the circumstances under which a
81 tenant is authorized to take certain remedial actions without providing notice. (NRS
82 118A.355, 118A.380)
83 Existing law authorizes a tenant whose landlord has failed to maintain a
84 dwelling unit in a habitable condition to take certain remedial actions if a landlord
85 fails to adequately remedy the failure or use his or her best efforts to remedy the
86 failure within a certain period of time. (NRS 118A.355) Section 4 of this bill
87 authorizes a tenant, in addition to such remedial actions, to file a verified complaint
88 for expedited relief with the court within 15 judicial days after the failure of the
89 landlord to remedy the failure and sets forth procedures relating to the filing,
90 hearing and disposition of such a verified complaint. Section 4 also: (1) authorizes
91 a tenant who files such a verified complaint to withhold any rent that becomes due
92 without incurring late fees, charges for notice or certain other charges until the
93 landlord has remedied the failure; (2) authorizes the court to order that such rent be
94 placed into an escrow account which is maintained or approved by the court; and
95 (3) requires the payment of all costs and official fees for any tenant who files such a
96 verified complaint to be deferred and later assessed against the party that does not
97 prevail. Section 17 of this bill authorizes a tenant to provide a copy of the notice
98 provided to a landlord to a district board of health for purposes of certain provisions
99 relating to the inspection of and administrative proceedings concerning health
100 hazards, in addition to any remedy provided in section 4.
101 Existing law further requires justice courts to establish by local rule a
102 mechanism by which tenants that withhold rent under such circumstances may
103 deposit such rent into an escrow account maintained or approved by the court.
104 (NRS 118A.355) Section 11: (1) requires such rules to additionally provide for the
105 deposit of rent withheld pursuant to section 4; and (2) prohibits a court from
106 releasing any money deposited into such accounts until the time period to file an
107 appeal has run.
108 Existing law additionally prohibits a tenant whose landlord has failed to
109 maintain a dwelling unit in a habitable condition from taking certain remedial
110 actions if the condition was caused by the tenant’s own deliberate or negligent act
111 or omission or that of a member of his or her household or other person on the
112 premises with his or her consent. (NRS 118A.355) Section 11 prohibits such a
113 tenant from taking such remedial actions, including filing a verified complaint for
114 expedited relief pursuant to section 4, if the condition was proven, by clear and
115 convincing evidence, to have been caused by the tenant’s own deliberate or
-
*AB223*

– 4 –
116 negligent act or omission or that of a member of his or her household or other
117 person on the premises with his or her consent who is not another tenant, or guest
118 thereof, who is on the premises pursuant to a separate rental agreement. Section 12
119 similarly prohibits a tenant whose landlord has willfully or negligently failed to
120 supply essential items or services from taking certain remedial actions under such
121 circumstances. (NRS 118A.380)
122 Existing law authorizes a tenant to take certain remedial actions if his or her
123 landlord willfully or negligently fails to supply essential items or services and by
124 doing so, caused the premises to become unfit for habitation. Existing law further
125 provides a nonexhaustive list of certain items and services which constitute
126 essential items or services, including, heat, air-conditioning, running water, hot
127 water, electricity, gas and a functioning door lock. (NRS 118A.380) Section 12
128 includes in such a list a functioning window lock and functional safety equipment.
129 Existing law authorizes a tenant to take certain actions and recover actual
130 damages or an amount not greater than $2,500 which is fixed by a court, or both, if
131 a landlord: (1) unlawfully removes the tenant from the premises or excludes the
132 tenant by blocking or attempting to block the tenant’s entry upon the premises; (2)
133 willfully interrupts or causes or permits the interruption of any essential item or
134 service required by the rental agreement or by law; or (3) recovers possession of the
135 dwelling unit under certain other circumstances which are prohibited by existing
136 law. (NRS 118A.390) Section 13 of this bill: (1) revises the monetary amount that
137 a tenant is authorized to recover by instead providing that the tenant is authorized to
138 recover an amount which is three times the periodic rent or the tenant’s actual
139 damages, whichever is greater; and (2) additionally authorizes such remedial
140 measures in circumstances where a landlord negligently interrupts or causes or
141 permits the interruption of any essential item or service required by the rental
142 agreement or by law. Section 15 of this bill makes a conforming change to make
143 the revisions made by section 13 inapplicable to provisions governing liability of a
144 landlord who unlawfully retains the household goods or personal property of a
145 tenant. (NRS 118A.520) Section 16 of this bill makes a conforming change to
146 require certain notices provided to a tenant to include notice of the ability of the
147 tenant to seek relief if a landlord negligently interrupts or causes or permits the
148 interruption of any essential item or service required by the rental agreement or by
149 law. (NRS 40.253)
150 Section 13: (1) requires a landlord to provide a tenant who terminates his or her
151 rental agreement under certain circumstances to provide the tenant with a
152 reasonable length of time to gather his or her belongings; (2) provides that a
153 landlord who was provided notice by a tenant which specified the willful or
154 negligent failure to supply essential items or services and failed to remedy the
155 breach is presumed to have negligently caused the interruption of essential items
156 and services; and (3) provides that a landlord may overcome such a presumption by
157 showing clear and convincing evidence that the restoration could not be
158 accomplished within the notice period. Finally, section 13 extends the length of
159 time for a tenant to file certain verified complaints for expedited relief with the
160 court from 5 judicial days after the last date of the unlawful act by the landlord to
161 15 judicial days after the last date on which the unlawful conduct of the landlord
162 occurred. (NRS 118A.390)
163 Existing law: (1) requires a landlord, or any person authorized to enter into a
164 rental agreement on his or her behalf, to disclose certain information to a tenant in
165 writing before the commencement of a tenancy or to post such information in
166 certain areas; and (2) authorizes a tenant to recover actual damages or $25,
167 whichever is greater, after a demand if the landlord fails to make such disclosures
168 or postings. (NRS 118A.260, 118A.270, 118A.410) Section 14 of this bill instead
169 provides that a tenant is authorized to recover actual damages or an amount equal to
170 1 month of rent, whichever is greater, under such circumstances.

5 for any direct, consequential or incidental injuries or losses,
6 including, without limitation, any amount payable to a landlord or
7 tenant under a rental agreement for a violation of the rental
8 agreement or any such amount based on the diminution of the
9 value of a dwelling unit. The term does not include any attorney’s
10 fees or any business expenses which are charged on a pro rata
11 basis pursuant to the provisions of a rental agreement.
12 Sec. 3. “Diminution of the value of a dwelling unit” means a
13 portion of the rent of a dwelling unit which reflects, as determined
14 by the court with or without expert testimony, the extent to which a
15 condition of the premises which violates the provisions of this
16 chapter or a rental agreement impairs the use and enjoyment of
17 the dwelling unit by the tenant.
18 Sec. 4. 1. If a tenant provides written notice to a landlord
19 pursuant to subsection 1 of NRS 118A.355 and the landlord fails
20 to remedy a failure to maintain the dwelling unit in a habitable
21 condition within the time prescribed in NRS 118A.355, the tenant
22 may file a verified complaint for expedited relief with the court.
23 When filing a verified complaint pursuant to this subsection, a
24 tenant may withhold any rent that becomes due without incurring
25 late fees, charges for notice or any other charge or fee authorized
26 by this chapter or the rental agreement.
27 2. A verified complaint filed pursuant to subsection 1 must
28 state:
29 (a) The manner in which the tenant provided notice of each
30 failure to the landlord;
31 (b) The date on which the tenant provided notice of each

5 tenant retains the right to pursue all other available remedies
6 against the landlord.
7 (b) May be consolidated with any action for summary eviction
8 or unlawful detainer that is already pending between the landlord
9 and tenant.
10 (c) May be raised as a defense in an action for summary
11 eviction or unlawful detainer.
12 4. The court shall conduct a hearing on a verified complaint
13 filed pursuant to subsection 1 not later than 7 judicial days after
14 the filing of the verified complaint. Before or at the scheduled
15 hearing, the tenant must provide to the court proof that the
16 landlord has been properly served with a copy of the verified
17 complaint. Upon the hearing, if the court determines that the
18 landlord has violated the provisions of subsection 1 of NRS
19 118A.355, the court may:
20 (a) Order the landlord to remedy each failure specified in the
21 verified complaint;
22 (b) Award actual damages; and
23 (c) Enjoin the landlord from unlawfully removing the tenant
24 from the dwelling unit or excluding the tenant by blocking or
25 attempting to block the tenant’s entry upon the dwelling unit and,

27 (1) Hold the landlord in contempt of court; or
28 (2) Abate the rent owed by the tenant in total or in part, in
29 addition to any amount of rent owed which is reduced pursuant to
30 subsection 5.
31 5. If a tenant has withheld rent pursuant to subsection 1, the
32 court shall determine the amount of rent that the tenant owes to
33 the landlord during the period of time in which one or more
34 failures specified in the verified complaint exist by subtracting the
35 diminution of the value of the dwelling unit from the rent owed by
36 the tenant pursuant to the rental agreement. The court may order
37 that any such rent which is currently owed by the tenant or will be
38 owed by the tenant be placed into an escrow account which is
39 maintained or approved by the court. A landlord is not eligible to
40 receive any money placed into an escrow account pursuant to this
41 subsection until the landlord submits to the court evidence that the
42 failure has been remedied.
43 6. The payment of all costs and fees must be deferred for any
44 tenant who files a verified complaint for expedited relief pursuant
45 to this section. After any hearing and not later than the final

22 guest thereof, who is on the premises pursuant to a separate rental
23 agreement.
24 3. If the rental agreement is terminated, the landlord shall

43 landlord [adequately] remedies the failure [or uses his or her best
44 efforts to remedy the failure] within 14 days after receipt of the
45 notice, the tenant may not proceed under this section. If the landlord
-
*AB223*

– 13 –
1 fails to remedy a [material] failure to maintain the dwelling unit in a
2 habitable condition [or to make a reasonable effort to do so] within
3 the prescribed time, the tenant may [:] file a verified complaint
4 pursuant to section 4 of this act or:
5 (a) [Terminate] Without incurring any fee which is assessed
6 for the early termination of a rental agreement, terminate the
7 rental agreement by providing the landlord with written notice of
8 the intent of the tenant to terminate the rental agreement
9 immediately [.] or on a date which is not later than 60 days after
10 the notice is provided to the landlord.
11 (b) Recover actual damages.

25 to a separate rental agreement; or
26 (b) If the landlord’s inability to [adequately] remedy the failure
27 [or use his or her best efforts to remedy the failure] within 14 days is
28 due to the tenant’s refusal to allow lawful access to the dwelling unit
29 as required by the rental agreement or this chapter.
30 3. If the rental agreement is terminated, the landlord shall
31 return all prepaid rent and any security deposit recoverable by the
32 tenant under this chapter.

9 which tenants may deposit rent withheld under paragraph [(d)] (c) of
10 subsection 1 or pursuant to section 4 of this act into an escrow
11 account maintained or approved by the court. A tenant does not
12 have a defense to an eviction under paragraph [(d)] (c) of subsection
13 1 unless the tenant has deposited the withheld rent into an escrow
14 account pursuant to this subsection. A court shall not release any
15 money deposited into an escrow account pursuant to this section
16 or section 4 of this act until the time period to file an appeal has

18 Sec. 12. NRS 118A.380 is hereby amended to read as follows:
19 118A.380 1. If the landlord is required by the rental
20 agreement or this chapter to supply heat, air-conditioning, running
21 water, hot water, electricity, gas, a functioning door lock , a
22 functioning window lock, functional safety equipment or another
23 essential item or service and the landlord willfully or negligently
24 fails to do so, causing the premises to become unfit for habitation,
25 the tenant shall give written notice to the landlord specifying the
26 breach. If the landlord does not [adequately] remedy the breach [, or
27 use his or her best efforts to remedy the breach] within 48 hours,
28 except a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, after it is received by
29 the landlord, the tenant may, in addition to any other remedy:
30 (a) Procure reasonable amounts of such essential items or
31 services during the landlord’s noncompliance and deduct their
32 actual and reasonable cost from the rent;
33 (b) Recover actual damages, including damages based upon the

40 which is not later than 60 days after the notice is provided to the
41 landlord;
42 (d) Withhold any rent that becomes due during the landlord’s
43 noncompliance without incurring late fees, charges for notice or any
44 other charge or fee authorized by this chapter or the rental
-
*AB223*

– 15 –
1 agreement, until the landlord has [attempted in good faith to restore]
2 restored the essential items or services; [or
3 (d)] (e) Proceed under NRS 118A.390; or
4 (f) Procure other housing which is comparable during the

9 2. If the tenant proceeds under this section, the tenant may not
10 proceed under NRS 118A.350 and 118A.360 as to that breach.
11 3. The rights of the tenant under this section do not arise until
12 the tenant has given written notice as required by subsection 1,
13 except that the tenant may, without having given that notice:
14 (a) Recover damages as authorized under paragraph (b) of

27 (2) Fails to remedy [or attempt in good faith to remedy] the
28 breach within the time prescribed in the written notice of that
29 condition from the governmental agency.
30 4. The rights of the tenant under paragraph [(c)] (d) of
31 subsection 1 do not arise unless the tenant is current in the payment
32 of rent at the time of giving written notice pursuant to subsection 1.
33 5. If such a condition was proven by clear and convincing
34 evidence to be caused by the deliberate or negligent act or omission
35 of the tenant, a member of his or her household or other person on
36 the premises with his or her consent [,] who is not another tenant,
37 or guest thereof, who is on the premises pursuant to a separate

14 118A.380 and failed to remedy the breach, the landlord is
15 presumed to have negligently caused the interruption of the
16 essential items or services and may overcome this presumption
17 only if the landlord shows by clear and convincing evidence that
18 the restoration could not be accomplished within the notice period.
19 3. If the rental agreement is terminated pursuant to subsection
20 1, the landlord shall [return] :
21 (a) Provide the tenant with a reasonable length of time to
22 gather his or her belongings; and
23 (b) Return all prepaid rent and any security deposit recoverable
24 under this chapter.

28 removal or exclusion of the tenant from the premises, the willful or
29 negligent interruption of any essential item or service or the
30 recovery of possession of the dwelling unit in violation of
31 NRS 118A.480.
32 5. A verified complaint for expedited relief:
33 (a) Must be filed with the court within [5] 15 judicial days after
34 the last date [of] on which the unlawful [act by] conduct of the
35 landlord [,] occurred, and the verified complaint must be dismissed
36 if it is not timely filed. If the verified complaint for expedited relief
37 is dismissed pursuant to this paragraph, the tenant retains the right to
38 pursue all other available remedies against the landlord.
39 (b) May be consolidated with any action for summary eviction
40 or unlawful detainer that is already pending between the landlord
41 and tenant.
42 6. The court shall conduct a hearing on the verified complaint
43 for expedited relief not later than 3 judicial days after the filing of
44 the verified complaint for expedited relief. Before or at the
45 scheduled hearing, the tenant must provide proof that the landlord
-
*AB223*

– 17 –
1 has been properly served with a copy of the verified complaint for
2 expedited relief. Upon the hearing, if it is determined that the
3 landlord has violated any of the provisions of subsection 1, the court
4 may:
5 (a) Order the landlord to restore to the tenant the premises or
6 essential items or services, or both;
7 (b) Award damages pursuant to subsection 1; and
8 (c) Enjoin the landlord from violating the provisions of

17 Sec. 14. NRS 118A.410 is hereby amended to read as follows:
18 118A.410 After a demand by the tenant, if a landlord fails to
19 disclose as provided in NRS 118A.260 or NRS 118A.270, the tenant
20 may recover actual damages or [$25,] an amount equal to one
21 month’s periodic rent, whichever is greater.
22 Sec. 15. NRS 118A.520 is hereby amended to read as follows:
23 118A.520 1. Any lien or security interest in the tenant’s
24 household goods created in favor of the landlord to ensure the

40 40.253 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 12, in
41 addition to the remedy provided in NRS 40.2512 and 40.290 to
42 40.420, inclusive, when the tenant of any dwelling, apartment,
43 mobile home or recreational vehicle with periodic rent reserved by
44 the month or any shorter period is in default in payment of the rent,
45 the landlord or the landlord’s agent may cause to be served a notice
-
*AB223*

– 18 –
1 in writing, requiring in the alternative the payment of the rent or the
2 surrender of the premises:
3 (a) Before the close of business on the seventh judicial day
4 following the day of service; or
5 (b) If the landlord chooses not to proceed in the manner set forth
6 in paragraph (a) and the rent is reserved by a period of 1 week or
7 less and the tenancy has not continued for more than 45 days, at or
8 before noon of the fourth full day following the day of service.
9  As used in this subsection, “day of service” means the day the
10 landlord or the landlord’s agent personally delivers the notice to the
11 tenant. If personal service was not so delivered, the “day of service”
12 means the day the notice is delivered, after posting and mailing
13 pursuant to subsection 2, to the sheriff or constable for service if the
14 request for service is made before noon. If the request for service by
15 the sheriff or constable is made after noon, the “day of service” shall
16 be deemed to be the day next following the day that the request is
17 made for service by the sheriff or constable.
18 2. A landlord or the landlord’s agent who serves a notice to a

29 evidence, signed by the tenant when the tenant took possession of
30 the premises, that the landlord or the landlord’s agent informed the
31 tenant of the provisions of this section which set forth the lawful
32 procedures for eviction from a short-term tenancy. Upon
33 acceptance, the sheriff or constable shall serve the notice within 48
34 hours after the request for service was made by the landlord or the
35 landlord’s agent.
36 3. A notice served pursuant to subsection 1 or 2 must:
37 (a) Identify the court that has jurisdiction over the matter; and
38 (b) Advise the tenant:

42 jurisdiction over the matter stating that the tenant has tendered
43 payment or is not in default in the payment of the rent;
-
*AB223*

– 19 –
1 (2) That if the court determines that the tenant is guilty of an
2 unlawful detainer, the court may issue a summary order for removal
3 of the tenant or an order providing for the nonadmittance of the
4 tenant, directing the sheriff or constable of the county to post the
5 order in a conspicuous place on the premises not later than 24 hours
6 after the order is received by the sheriff or constable. The sheriff or
7 constable shall remove the tenant not earlier than 24 hours but not
8 later than 36 hours after the posting of the order; and
9 (3) That, pursuant to NRS 118A.390, a tenant may seek relief
10 if a landlord unlawfully removes the tenant from the premises or
11 excludes the tenant by blocking or attempting to block the tenant’s
12 entry upon the premises or willfully or negligently interrupts or
13 causes or permits the interruption of an essential service required by
14 the rental agreement or chapter 118A of NRS.
15 4. If the tenant files such an affidavit at or before the time
16 stated in the notice, the landlord or the landlord’s agent, after receipt
17 of a file-stamped copy of the affidavit which was filed, shall not
18 provide for the nonadmittance of the tenant to the premises by
19 locking or otherwise.
20 5. Upon noncompliance with the notice:
21 (a) The landlord or the landlord’s agent may apply by affidavit
22 of complaint for eviction to the justice court of the township in
23 which the dwelling, apartment, mobile home or recreational vehicle
24 are located or to the district court of the county in which the
25 dwelling, apartment, mobile home or recreational vehicle are
26 located, whichever has jurisdiction over the matter. The court may
27 thereupon issue an order directing the sheriff or constable of the
28 county to post the order in a conspicuous place on the premises not
29 later than 24 hours after the order is received by the sheriff or
30 constable. The sheriff or constable shall remove the tenant not
31 earlier than 24 hours but not later than 36 hours after the posting of
32 the order. The affidavit must state or contain:
33 (1) The date the tenancy commenced.
34 (2) The amount of periodic rent reserved.
35 (3) The amounts of any cleaning, security or rent deposits
36 paid in advance, in excess of the first month’s rent, by the tenant.
37 (4) The date the rental payments became delinquent.
38 (5) The length of time the tenant has remained in possession

43 (8) A copy of the written notice served on the tenant.
44 (9) A copy of the signed written rental agreement, if any.
-
*AB223*

– 20 –
1 (b) Except when the tenant has timely filed the affidavit
2 described in subsection 3 and a file-stamped copy of it has been
3 received by the landlord or the landlord’s agent, and except when
4 the landlord is prohibited pursuant to NRS 118A.480, the landlord
5 or the landlord’s agent may, in a peaceable manner, provide for the
6 nonadmittance of the tenant to the premises by locking or otherwise.
7 6. Upon the filing by the tenant of the affidavit permitted in
8 subsection 3, regardless of the information contained in the
9 affidavit, and the filing by the landlord of the affidavit permitted by
10 subsection 5, the justice court or the district court shall hold a
11 hearing, after service of notice of the hearing upon the parties, to
12 determine the truthfulness and sufficiency of any affidavit or notice
13 provided for in this section. If the court determines that there is no
14 legal defense as to the alleged unlawful detainer and the tenant is
15 guilty of an unlawful detainer, the court may issue a summary order
16 for removal of the tenant or an order providing for the
17 nonadmittance of the tenant. If the court determines that there is a
18 legal defense as to the alleged unlawful detainer, the court shall
19 refuse to grant either party any relief, and, except as otherwise
20 provided in this subsection, shall require that any further
21 proceedings be conducted pursuant to NRS 40.290 to 40.420,
22 inclusive. The issuance of a summary order for removal of the
23 tenant does not preclude an action by the tenant for any damages or
24 other relief to which the tenant may be entitled. If the alleged
25 unlawful detainer was based upon subsection 5 of NRS 40.2514, the
26 refusal by the court to grant relief does not preclude the landlord
27 thereafter from pursuing an action for unlawful detainer in
28 accordance with NRS 40.251.
29 7. The tenant may, upon payment of the appropriate fees
30 relating to the filing and service of a motion, file a motion with the
31 court, on a form provided by the clerk of the court, to dispute the

40 that the tenant provided to the landlord. If, upon inspection of the
41 dwelling unit, the district board of health determines that either the
42 landlord or the tenant has failed to maintain the dwelling unit in a
43 habitable condition, the district board of health may refer the matter
44 to the administrative hearing process if established pursuant to
45 subsection 3 or take any action with respect to the dwelling unit

15 6. All interested persons must be afforded a reasonable
16 opportunity to submit data, views or arguments, orally or in writing,
17 on the intended action to adopt, amend or repeal the regulation.
18 With respect to substantive regulations, the district board of health
19 shall set a time and place for an oral public hearing, but if no one
20 appears who will be directly affected by the proposal and requests
21 an oral hearing, the district board of health may proceed
22 immediately to act upon any written submissions. The district board
23 of health shall consider fully all written and oral submissions
24 respecting the proposal.

26 adopted regulations with the county clerk.
27 8. As used in this section:

29 used as a dwelling unit and is not occupied as, or designed or
30 intended for occupancy as, a residence or sleeping place.
31 (b) “Dwelling unit” has the meaning ascribed to it in
32 NRS 118A.080.
