AN ACT relating to occupational therapy; ratifying and entering
into the Occupational Therapy Licensure Compact;
authorizing the sharing of certain information with the
data system created pursuant to the Compact; providing a
person practicing as an occupational therapist or
occupational therapy assistant in this State under the
Compact with the same legal status as a person practicing
as an occupational therapist or occupational therapy
assistant under a license issued by the Board of
Occupational Therapy; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of occupational therapists
2 and occupational therapy assistants by the Board of Occupational Therapy.
3 (Chapter 640A of NRS) Section 1 of this bill ratifies and enters into the
4 Occupational Therapy Licensure Compact. The Compact is an interstate compact
5 that allows a person who is licensed as an occupational therapist or occupational
6 therapy assistant in a state that is a member of the Compact to practice in other
7 states that are members of the Compact. In order to practice as an occupational
8 therapist or occupational therapy assistant under the Compact, the Compact
9 requires an occupational therapist or occupational therapy assistant to: (1) hold a
10 license in his or her home state; (2) have a valid social security number or national
11 practitioner identification number; (3) have no encumbrances on any license issued
12 to the person by a state; (4) be eligible to practice under the Compact; (5) have, at
13 least 2 years before seeking to practice under the Compact, completed any
14 requirements and paid all fines resulting any adverse action taken against any
15 license or authority to practice under the Compact; (6) notify the Occupational
16 Therapy Compact Commission that he or she is seeking to practice under the
17 Compact in another state; (7) pay any applicable fees; (8) complete a criminal
-
*AB106*

– 2 –
18 background check; (9) meet any jurisprudence requirements established by the state
19 in which he or she seeks to practice under the Compact; and (10) report any adverse
20 action taken against him or her within 30 days after the date the adverse action is
21 taken. The Compact authorizes a member state to take adverse action against an
22 occupational therapist or occupational therapy assistant practicing in the member
23 state under the Compact.
24 The Compact requires member states to create a joint public agency called the
25 Occupational Therapy Compact Commission. The Commission is required to,
26 among other things: (1) establish bylaws; (2) make rules that facilitate and
27 coordinate implementation and administration of the Compact; (3) hold meetings,
28 which may be closed under certain conditions; and (4) resolve disputes related to
29 the Compact among states that are members of the Compact. The Commission is
30 additionally authorized to levy and collect an annual assessment from each state
31 that is a member of the Compact.
32 The Compact also requires the Commission to create a data system to facilitate
33 the sharing of information among member states. Section 2 of this bill, in general,
34 authorizes the Board of Occupational Therapy to disclose information to that data
35 system when required by the Compact. However, the Compact prohibits the Board
36 from disclosing certain information obtained through a criminal background check.
37 Section 4 of this bill provides for the confidentiality of certain information
38 disclosed through the data system.
39 The Compact provides additional provisions to carry out the Compact,
40 including providing procedures for the taking of adverse actions against licensees,
41 provisions for active military members or their spouses, provisions for rulemaking
42 by the Commission, provisions for oversight, dispute resolution and enforcement
43 and procedures for amendments and withdrawals. The Compact takes effect on the
44 date on which the Compact is enacted into law by the tenth member state.
45 Section 3 of this bill deems practicing as an occupational therapist or
46 occupational therapy assistant under the Compact to be equivalent to practicing
47 under a license issued by the Board of Occupational Therapy, thereby providing
48 such persons with the same authority, duties and legal protections as a licensee.

35 3. The Commission shall be entitled to receive service of
36 process in any such proceeding, and shall have standing to

40 Rules.
41 B. Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination
42 1. If the Commission determines that a Member State has
43 defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities

*AB106*

– 21 –

8 defaulting State may be terminated from the Compact upon an
9 affirmative vote of a majority of the Member States, and all rights,
10 privileges and benefits conferred by this Compact may be
11 terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the
12 default does not relieve the offending State of obligations or
13 liabilities incurred during the period of default.
14 3. Termination of membership in the Compact shall be
15 imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have
16 been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be
17 given by the Commission to the governor, the majority and
18 minority leaders of the defaulting State’s legislature, and each of
19 the Member States.

29 Commission by petitioning the U.S. District Court for the District
30 of Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has its
31 principal offices. The prevailing member shall be awarded all
32 costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees.
33 C. Dispute Resolution

35 attempt to resolve disputes related to the Compact that arise
36 among Member States and between member and non-Member
37 States.
38 2. The Commission shall promulgate a Rule providing for
39 both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as

45 action in the United States District Court for the District of
-
*AB106*

– 22 –
1 Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has its
2 principal offices against a Member State in default to enforce
3 compliance with the provisions of the Compact and its
4 promulgated Rules and bylaws. The relief sought may include
5 both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial
6 enforcement is necessary, the prevailing member shall be awarded
7 all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees.
8 3. The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies
9 of the Commission. The Commission may pursue any other
10 remedies available under federal or State law.

24 Compact.
25 B. Any State that joins the Compact subsequent to the
26 Commission’s initial adoption of the Rules shall be subject to the
27 Rules as they exist on the date on which the Compact becomes law
28 in that State. Any Rule that has been previously adopted by the
29 Commission shall have the full force and effect of law on the day
30 the Compact becomes law in that State.
31 C. Any Member State may withdraw from this Compact by
32 enacting a statute repealing the same.
33 1. A Member State’s withdrawal shall not take effect until
34 six (6) months after enactment of the repealing statute.
35 2. Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement
36 of the withdrawing State’s Occupational Therapy Licensing Board
37 to comply with the investigative and Adverse Action reporting
38 requirements of this act prior to the effective date of withdrawal.
39 D. Nothing contained in this Compact shall be construed to
40 invalidate or prevent any Occupational Therapy licensure
41 agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a Member
42 State and a non-Member State that does not conflict with the
43 provisions of this Compact.
44 E. This Compact may be amended by the Member States. No

4 SECTION 13. CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY

9 Compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any
10 Member State or of the United States or the applicability thereof to
11 any government, agency, person, or circumstance is held invalid,
12 the validity of the remainder of this Compact and the applicability
13 thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance shall
14 not be affected thereby. If this Compact shall be held contrary to
15 the constitution of any Member State, the Compact shall remain in
16 full force and effect as to the remaining Member States and in full
17 force and effect as to the Member State affected as to all severable
18 matters.
19
20 SECTION 14. BINDING EFFECT OF
