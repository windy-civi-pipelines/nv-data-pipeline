AN ACT relating to state financial administration; revising
provisions relating to the Governor Guinn Millennium
Scholarship Program; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the State Treasurer to administer the Nevada College
2 Savings Trust Fund and to establish and administer certain accounts, including an
3 Endowment Account in the State General Fund, to carry out the duties of the State
4 Treasurer with respect to the Nevada College Savings Program. Specifically,
5 existing law requires that the Endowment Account be used for the deposit of any
6 money received by the Nevada College Savings Program that is not received
7 pursuant to a savings trust agreement and which the State Treasurer determines is
8 not necessary for certain administration and marketing activities. (NRS 353B.300,
9 353B.350) Among other things, existing law authorizes the State Treasurer to
10 expend money from the Endowment Account for purposes related to the Governor
11 Guinn Millennium Scholarship Program, including, without limitation, to cover the
12 costs of administering the Governor Guinn Millennium Scholarship Program, if the
13 expenditure does not exceed an amount equal to 3 percent of the anticipated annual
14 revenue to this State from the settlement agreements with and civil actions against
15 manufacturers of tobacco products anticipated for deposit in the Trust Fund. (NRS
16 353B.350, 396.926) This bill: (1) increases from 3 to 13 percent the maximum
17 amount that the State Treasurer is authorized to expend from the Endowment
18 Account for the Governor Guinn Millennium Scholarship Program; and (2)
19 specifies that the reference to “Trust Fund” for such expenditures related to the
20 Governor Guinn Millennium Scholarship Program is the Millennium Scholarship
21 Trust Fund.
