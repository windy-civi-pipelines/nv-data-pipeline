licensed child care facility; requiring the governing body
of a county or incorporated city to authorize the operation

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth certain requirements for the licensure and operation of

3 Department of Health and Human Services or the governing body of a county or an
4 incorporated city. (NRS 432A.131-432A.220) Existing law authorizes the unit-
5 owners’ association of a common-interest community to adopt rules and regulations
6 governing the common-interest community. (NRS 116.3102) Section 1 of this bill
7 prohibits, with certain exceptions, the executive board and governing documents of
8 a unit-owners’ association from prohibiting the operation of a licensed child care
9 facility by a unit’s owner. Section 1 authorizes the executive board and governing
10 documents to impose conditions or restrictions on a licensed child care facility that
11 are consistent with the conditions and requirements to obtain a license for a child
12 care facility. Additionally, section 1 provides that these provisions do not apply to a
13 common-interest community that imposes certain age restrictions.
14 Existing law sets forth various requirements for rental agreements between a
15 landlord and tenant for the use and occupancy of a dwelling unit or premises.

19 Existing law authorizes a governing body to divide the city, county or region
20 into zoning districts of such number, shape and area as are best suited to carry out
21 certain purposes. Within a zoning district, the governing body may regulate and
22 restrict the erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair or use of
23 buildings, structures or land. (NRS 278.250) Section 3 of this bill requires the
24 governing body to adopt an ordinance that authorizes a licensed child care facility
25 to operate in any zoning district that is zoned for residential use. Section 3 prohibits
26 such an ordinance from: (1) imposing restrictions on a child care facility that are
27 more restrictive than the restrictions imposed on dwelling units in the zoning
28 district; or (2) requiring a licensed child care facility to obtain any additional
29 permits relating to the zoning or use of the dwelling unit as a licensed child care
30 facility. Section 6 of this bill includes section 3 in the purposes that a governing
31 body is required to carry out when the governing body establishes zoning districts.
32 Section 4 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law governing planning
33 and zoning to the provisions of section 3.
34 Section 5 of this bill applies the provisions governing actions and proceedings
35 for judicial relief or review from any final action, decision or order of any
36 governing body, commission or board to the provisions of section 3.
37 Existing law requires the State Board of Health to adopt licensing standards for
38 child care facilities. (NRS 432A.077) Existing law authorizes the governing body
39 of a county or incorporated city to establish an agency for the licensing of child
40 care facilities that do not need to be licensed by the Division. Such a licensing
41 agency is required to adopt standards and regulations that must: (1) not be less
42 restrictive than the standards and regulations adopted by the Board; and (2) be
43 approved by the Division. (NRS 432A.131) Sections 7 and 8 of this bill prohibit
44 the standards adopted by the Board and the standards and regulations adopted by
45 the licensing agency from prohibiting the licensure of a child care facility that does
46 not have an outdoor play space that is located: (1) in a multi-family dwelling or an
47 apartment or condominium building; and (2) within 1 mile of an accessible park,
48 school or space that is open to the public for outdoor recreation.
