EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to child care; prohibiting the unit-owners’
association of certain common-interest communities from
prohibiting the operation of certain licensed child care
facilities; authorizing, with certain exceptions, a tenant to
operate a certain licensed child care facility; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth certain requirements for the licensure and operation of
2 child care facilities by the Division of Welfare and Supportive Services of the
3 Department of Health and Human Services or the governing body of a county or an
4 incorporated city. (NRS 432A.131-432A.220) Existing law authorizes the unit-
5 owners’ association of a common-interest community to adopt rules and regulations
6 governing the common-interest community. (NRS 116.3102) Section 1 of this bill
7 prohibits, with certain exceptions, the executive board and governing documents of
8 a unit-owners’ association from prohibiting the operation of a licensed child care
9 facility by a unit’s owner or tenant provided that the licensed child care facility
10 provides care for at least 5 but not more than 12 children. Section 1 authorizes the
11 executive board and governing documents to: (1) impose conditions or restrictions
12 on a licensed child care facility that are consistent with the conditions and
13 requirements to obtain a license for a child care facility; (2) limit the number of
14 licensed child care facilities that may operate in the common-interest community;
15 (3) require a unit’s owner or tenant to file a notice of an application for licensure of
16 a child care facility; or (4) require the licensed child care facility to add the unit-
17 owners’ association as an additional insured on the policy of insurance maintained
18 by the child care facility. Section 1 further provides that these provisions apply,
19 with certain exceptions, to a common-interest community, including, without
20 limitation, a master association and any common-interest community that is subject
21 to a master association. Additionally, section 1 provides that these provisions do
22 not apply to a common-interest community that is housing for older persons or
23 contains certain units that share an interior wall with another unit.

27 licensed child care facility that provides care for at least 5 but not more than 12
28 children unless otherwise prohibited by the terms of the rental agreement.
