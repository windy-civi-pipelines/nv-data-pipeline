AN ACT relating to child care; prohibiting the unit-owners’ association of [a]
certain common-interest [community] communities from prohibiting
the operation of [a] certain licensed child care [facility;] facilities;
authorizing, with certain exceptions, a tenant to operate a certain
licensed child care facility; [requiring the governing body of a county
or incorporated city to authorize the operation of child care facilities in
certain zoning districts;] setting forth certain requirements for licensing
standards for certain child care facilities; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth certain requirements for the licensure and operation of child care
2 facilities by the Division of Welfare and Supportive Services of the Department of Health and
3 Human Services or the governing body of a county or an incorporated city. (NRS 432A.131-
4 432A.220) Existing law authorizes the unit-owners’ association of a common-interest
5 community to adopt rules and regulations governing the common-interest community. (NRS
6 116.3102) Section 1 of this bill prohibits, with certain exceptions, the executive board and
7 governing documents of a unit-owners’ association from prohibiting the operation of a
8 licensed child care facility by a unit’s owner [.] provided that the licensed child care facility
9 provides care for at least 5 but not more than 12 children. Section 1 authorizes the
10 executive board and governing documents to impose conditions or restrictions on a licensed
11 child care facility that are consistent with the conditions and requirements to obtain a license
12 for a child care facility. Section 1 further provides that these provisions apply, with
13 certain exceptions, to a common-interest community, including, without limitation, a
14 master association and any common-interest community that is subject to a master
15 association. Additionally, section 1 provides that these provisions do not apply to a common-
16 interest community that imposes certain age restrictions.
17 Existing law sets forth various requirements for rental agreements between a landlord and
18 tenant for the use and occupancy of a dwelling unit or premises. (Chapter 118A of NRS)
19 Section 2 of this bill authorizes a tenant to operate a licensed child care facility that provides
20 care for at least 5 but not more than 12 children unless otherwise prohibited by the terms
21 of the rental agreement.
22 [Existing law authorizes a governing body to divide the city, county or region into zoning
23 districts of such number, shape and area as are best suited to carry out certain purposes.
24 Within a zoning district, the governing body may regulate and restrict the erection,
25 construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair or use of buildings, structures or land. (NRS

Assembly Amendment No. 71 to Assembly Bill No. 185 Page 4
26 278.250) Section 3 of this bill requires the governing body to adopt an ordinance that
27 authorizes a licensed child care facility to operate in any zoning district that is zoned for
28 residential use. Section 3 prohibits such an ordinance from: (1) imposing restrictions on a
29 child care facility that are more restrictive than the restrictions imposed on dwelling units in
30 the zoning district; or (2) requiring a licensed child care facility to obtain any additional
31 permits relating to the zoning or use of the dwelling unit as a licensed child care facility.
32 Section 6 of this bill includes section 3 in the purposes that a governing body is required to
33 carry out when the governing body establishes zoning districts.
34 Section 4 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law governing planning and zoning
35 to the provisions of section 3.
36 Section 5 of this bill applies the provisions governing actions and proceedings for judicial
37 relief or review from any final action, decision or order of any governing body, commission or
38 board to the provisions of section 3.]
39 Existing law requires the State Board of Health to adopt licensing standards for child care
40 facilities. (NRS 432A.077) Existing law authorizes the governing body of a county or
41 incorporated city to establish an agency for the licensing of child care facilities that do not
42 need to be licensed by the Division. Such a licensing agency is required to adopt standards
43 and regulations that must: (1) not be less restrictive than the standards and regulations adopted
44 by the Board; and (2) be approved by the Division. (NRS 432A.131) Sections 7 and 8 of this
45 bill prohibit the standards adopted by the Board and the standards and regulations adopted by
46 the licensing agency from prohibiting the licensure of a child care facility that provides care
47 for at least 5 but not more than 12 children and does not have an outdoor play space that is
48 located: (1) in a multi-family dwelling or an apartment or condominium building; and (2)
49 within 1 mile of an accessible park, school or space that is open to the public for outdoor
50 recreation.
