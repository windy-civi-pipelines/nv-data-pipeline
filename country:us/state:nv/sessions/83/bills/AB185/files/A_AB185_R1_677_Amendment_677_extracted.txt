EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to child care; prohibiting the unit-owners’ association of certain
common-interest communities from prohibiting the operation of certain
licensed child care facilities; authorizing, with certain exceptions, a
tenant to operate a certain licensed child care facility; [setting forth
certain requirements for licensing standards for certain child care
facilities;] and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth certain requirements for the licensure and operation of child care
2 facilities by the Division of Welfare and Supportive Services of the Department of Health and
3 Human Services or the governing body of a county or an incorporated city. (NRS 432A.131-
4 432A.220) Existing law authorizes the unit-owners’ association of a common-interest
5 community to adopt rules and regulations governing the common-interest community. (NRS
6 116.3102) Section 1 of this bill prohibits, with certain exceptions, the executive board and
7 governing documents of a unit-owners’ association from prohibiting the operation of a
8 licensed child care facility by a unit’s owner or tenant provided that the licensed child care
9 facility provides care for at least 5 but not more than 12 children. Section 1 authorizes the
10 executive board and governing documents to : (1) impose conditions or restrictions on a
11 licensed child care facility that are consistent with the conditions and requirements to obtain a
12 license for a child care facility [.] ; (2) limit the number of licensed child care facilities that
13 may operate in the common-interest community; (3) require a unit’s owner or tenant to
14 file a notice of an application for licensure of a child care facility; or (4) require the
15 licensed child care facility to add the unit-owners’ association as an additional insured
16 on the policy of insurance maintained by the child care facility. Section 1 further provides
17 that these provisions apply, with certain exceptions, to a common-interest community,
18 including, without limitation, a master association and any common-interest community that
19 is subject to a master association. Additionally, section 1 provides that these provisions do not
20 apply to a common-interest community that [imposes certain age restrictions.] is housing for
21 older persons or contains certain units that share an interior wall with another unit.
22 Existing law sets forth various requirements for rental agreements between a landlord and
23 tenant for the use and occupancy of a dwelling unit or premises. (Chapter 118A of NRS)
24 Section 2 of this bill authorizes a tenant to operate a licensed child care facility that provides
25 care for at least 5 but not more than 12 children unless otherwise prohibited by the terms of
26 the rental agreement.
27 [Existing law requires the State Board of Health to adopt licensing standards for child
28 care facilities. (NRS 432A.077) Existing law authorizes the governing body of a county or
29 incorporated city to establish an agency for the licensing of child care facilities that do not

30 need to be licensed by the Division. Such a licensing agency is required to adopt standards
31 and regulations that must: (1) not be less restrictive than the standards and regulations adopted
32 by the Board; and (2) be approved by the Division. (NRS 432A.131) Sections 7 and 8 of this
33 bill prohibit the standards adopted by the Board and the standards and regulations adopted by
34 the licensing agency from prohibiting the licensure of a child care facility that provides care
35 for at least 5 but not more than 12 children and does not have an outdoor play space that is
36 located: (1) in a multi-family dwelling or an apartment or condominium building; and (2)
37 within 1 mile of an accessible park, school or space that is open to the public for outdoor
38 recreation.]
