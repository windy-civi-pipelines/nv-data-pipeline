AN ACT relating to child care; prohibiting the unit-owners’

facilities; authorizing, with certain exceptions, a tenant to

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth certain requirements for the licensure and operation of
2 child care facilities by the Division of Welfare and Supportive Services of the
3 Department of Health and Human Services or the governing body of a county or an
4 incorporated city. (NRS 432A.131-432A.220) Existing law authorizes the unit-
5 owners’ association of a common-interest community to adopt rules and regulations
6 governing the common-interest community. (NRS 116.3102) Section 1 of this bill
7 prohibits, with certain exceptions, the executive board and governing documents of
8 a unit-owners’ association from prohibiting the operation of a licensed child care
9 facility by a unit’s owner provided that the licensed child care facility provides care
10 for at least 5 but not more than 12 children. Section 1 authorizes the executive
11 board and governing documents to impose conditions or restrictions on a licensed
12 child care facility that are consistent with the conditions and requirements to obtain
13 a license for a child care facility. Section 1 further provides that these provisions
14 apply, with certain exceptions, to a common-interest community, including, without
15 limitation, a master association and any common-interest community that is subject
16 to a master association. Additionally, section 1 provides that these provisions do
17 not apply to a common-interest community that imposes certain age restrictions.
18 Existing law sets forth various requirements for rental agreements between a
19 landlord and tenant for the use and occupancy of a dwelling unit or premises.
20 (Chapter 118A of NRS) Section 2 of this bill authorizes a tenant to operate a

21 licensed child care facility that provides care for at least 5 but not more than 12
22 children unless otherwise prohibited by the terms of the rental agreement.
23 Existing law requires the State Board of Health to adopt licensing standards for
24 child care facilities. (NRS 432A.077) Existing law authorizes the governing body
25 of a county or incorporated city to establish an agency for the licensing of child
26 care facilities that do not need to be licensed by the Division. Such a licensing
27 agency is required to adopt standards and regulations that must: (1) not be less
28 restrictive than the standards and regulations adopted by the Board; and (2) be
29 approved by the Division. (NRS 432A.131) Sections 7 and 8 of this bill prohibit
30 the standards adopted by the Board and the standards and regulations adopted by
31 the licensing agency from prohibiting the licensure of a child care facility that
32 provides care for at least 5 but not more than 12 children and does not have an
33 outdoor play space that is located: (1) in a multi-family dwelling or an apartment or
34 condominium building; and (2) within 1 mile of an accessible park, school or space
35 that is open to the public for outdoor recreation.
