EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; requiring the Department of
Education to include a method for providing additional
weight to the scores of certain pupils on criterion-
referenced examinations in the statewide system of
accountability for public schools; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 To be eligible for certain federal funding, existing federal law requires a state to
2 have a statewide system for providing accountability for public schools. (20 U.S.C.
3 § 6311(c)) Existing law requires the statewide system of accountability to: (1)
4 include a method for rating each public school based upon the performance of the
5 school and whether each public school meets certain school achievement targets
6 and performance targets; and (2) establish school achievement targets and
7 performance targets which must be based primarily upon the measurement of the
8 progress and proficiency of pupils on the criterion-referenced examinations
9 prescribed by the State Board of Education. (NRS 385A.600, 390.105) This bill
10 requires the method used by the statewide system of accountability to rate each
11 public school, in incorporating the measurement of the progress and proficiency of
12 pupils on such examinations, to use a scoring system which places twice as much
13 weight on the progress in a subject of a pupil who, in the immediately preceding
14 year or on the last examination in that subject, received a score on an examination
15 that was lower than 75 percent of the pupils enrolled in the same grade at the same
16 school.

34 rate of attendance.
35 3. The method used by the statewide system of accountability
36 to rate each public school must, in incorporating the measurement
37 of the progress of pupils on the examinations administered
38 pursuant to NRS 390.105, use a scoring system which places twice
39 as much weight on the progress in a subject of a pupil who, in an
