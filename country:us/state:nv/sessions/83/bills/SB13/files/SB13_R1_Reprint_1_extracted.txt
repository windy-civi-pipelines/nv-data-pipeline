3 dismissed, the court is required to exonerate bail, except that the court is authorized
4 to delay exoneration of bail for a period not to exceed 30 days under certain
5 circumstances. (NRS 178.502) Section 1 of this bill provides that a court may
6 dispose of bail as agreed to by all parties.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN

1 Section 1. NRS 178.502 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 178.502 1. A person required or permitted to give bail shall
3 execute a bond for the person’s appearance. The magistrate or court
4 or judge or justice, having regard to the considerations set forth in
5 NRS 178.4851, may require one or more sureties or may authorize
6 the acceptance of cash or bonds or notes of the United States in an
7 amount equal to or less than the face amount of the bond.
8 2. Any bond or undertaking for bail must provide that the bond
9 or undertaking:
-
*SB13_R1*

1 (a) Extends to any action or proceeding in a justice court,
2 municipal court or district court arising from the charge on which
3 bail was first given in any of these courts; and
4 (b) Remains in effect until exonerated by the court.
5  This subsection does not require that any bond or undertaking
6 extend to proceedings on appeal.
7 3. If an action or proceeding against a defendant who has been
8 admitted to bail is transferred to another trial court, the bond or
9 undertaking must be transferred to the clerk of the court to which
10 the action or proceeding has been transferred.
11 4. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 5 [,] or as
12 otherwise agreed to by all parties, the court shall exonerate the
13 bond or undertaking for bail if:
14 (a) The action or proceeding against a defendant who has been
15 admitted to bail is dismissed; or
16 (b) No formal action or proceeding is instituted against a
17 defendant who has been admitted to bail.
18 5. The court may delay exoneration of the bond or undertaking
19 for bail for a period not to exceed 30 days if, at the time the action
20 or proceeding against a defendant who has been admitted to bail is
21 dismissed, the defendant:
22 (a) Has been indicted or is charged with a public offense which
23 is the same or substantially similar to the charge upon which bail
24 was first given and which arises out of the same act or omission
25 supporting the charge upon which bail was first given; or
26 (b) Requests to remain admitted to bail in anticipation of being
27 later indicted or charged with a public offense which is the same or
28 substantially similar to the charge upon which bail was first given
29 and which arises out of the same act or omission supporting the
30 charge upon which bail was first given.
31  If the defendant has already been indicted or charged, or is later
32 indicted or charged, with a public offense arising out of the same act
33 or omission supporting the charge upon which bail was first given,
34 the bail must be applied to the public offense for which the
35 defendant has been indicted or charged or is later indicted or
36 charged, and the bond or undertaking must be transferred to the
37 clerk of the appropriate court. Within 10 days after its receipt, the
38 clerk of the court to whom the bail is transferred shall mail or
39 electronically transmit notice of the transfer to the surety on the
40 bond and the bail agent who executed the bond.
41 6. Bail given originally on appeal must be deposited with the
42 magistrate or the clerk of the court from which the appeal is taken.
43 Sec. 2. This act becomes effective upon passage and approval.
