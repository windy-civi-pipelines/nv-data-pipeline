~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public safety; authorizing the installation and
use of an automated traffic enforcement system by a
governmental entity under certain circumstances; setting
forth the requirements for the installation and use of an
automated traffic enforcement system; establishing
provisions governing the issuance of a civil infraction
citation based on evidence detected by an automated
traffic enforcement system; requiring the Department of
Transportation to adopt certain regulations; requiring the
Advisory Committee on Traffic Safety to provide certain
recommendations to the Department; prohibiting an
insurer from increasing rates for motor vehicle insurance
under certain circumstances; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits a governmental entity or any agent thereof from using
2 photographic, video or digital equipment to gather evidence in order to issue a
3 traffic citation or civil infraction citation, unless the equipment is: (1) a portable
4 camera or event recording device worn or held by a peace officer; (2) installed
5 within a vehicle or facility of a law enforcement agency; or (3) privately owned by
6 a nongovernmental entity. (NRS 484A.600) Sections 2 and 3 of this bill create an
7 exception to this prohibition, authorizing a governmental entity to allow for the
-
*SB415*
– 2 –
8 installation and use of an automated traffic enforcement system to enforce
9 provisions of law governing speeding and obedience to traffic-control devices
10 under certain circumstances. Specifically, section 2 requires the governmental
11 entity to: (1) make certain findings about the location where the automated traffic
12 enforcement system will be installed; (2) provide for or undertake a public
13 information campaign about the automated traffic enforcement system; and (3)
14 comply with certain regulations required to be adopted by the Department of
15 Transportation related to automated traffic enforcement system and warning signs.
16 Section 7 of this bill requires the Advisory Committee on Traffic Safety to provide
17 recommendations to the Department related to these regulations.
18 If a governmental entity authorizes the installation and use of an automated
19 traffic enforcement system, section 2 requires a peace officer of a law enforcement
20 agency with jurisdiction over the location of the automated traffic enforcement
21 system to review the evidence of a violation detected by an automated traffic
22 enforcement system before a civil infraction citation is issued. Section 2 also
23 establishes requirements for the contents and delivery of the civil infraction citation
24 issued based upon evidence collected by an automated traffic enforcement system.
25 Section 2 creates a rebuttable presumption that the registered owner of a vehicle is
26 the driver of the vehicle at the time of a violation detected by an automated traffic
27 enforcement system and provides a method for rebutting this presumption.
28 Section 2 provides that a violation detected by an automated traffic
29 enforcement system is not a moving traffic violation but is punishable by a civil
30 penalty. Additionally, section 2 requires money received from such civil penalties
31 to be used for certain purposes related to defraying the costs of the automated
32 traffic enforcement system. Section 6 of this bill makes a conforming change
33 related to the deposit of money received from such civil penalties.
34 Sections 1, 4 and 5 of this bill make conforming changes to: (1) exclude traffic
35 violations detected by an automated traffic enforcement system from an assessment
36 of demerit points; and (2) provide for the issuance of a civil infraction citation for
37 violations detected by an automated traffic enforcement system.
38 Existing law prohibits an insurer from increasing insurance rates or cancelling
39 or refusing to renew an insurance policy if a juvenile court enters a conviction or
40 finding of certain violations relating to speeding. (NRS 690B.028) Section 8 of this
41 bill additionally prohibits a civil infraction citation issued for a violation detected
42 by an automated traffic enforcement system from being used for such purposes.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN

7 484A.705, inclusive. The term includes a finding by a juvenile court
8 that a child has violated a traffic law or ordinance other than one

2 an automated traffic enforcement system pursuant to section 2 of
3 this act.
4 2. The Department shall establish a uniform system of demerit
5 points for various traffic violations occurring within this State
6 affecting the driving privilege of any person who holds a driver’s
7 license issued by the Department and persons deemed to have future
8 driving privileges pursuant to NRS 483.447. The system must be
9 based on the accumulation of demerits during a period of 12
10 months.
11 3. The system must be uniform in its operation, and the
12 Department shall set up a schedule of demerits for each traffic
13 violation, depending upon the gravity of the violation, on a scale of
14 one demerit point for a minor violation of any traffic law to eight
15 demerit points for an extremely serious violation of the law
16 governing traffic violations. If a conviction of two or more traffic
17 violations committed on a single occasion is obtained, points must
18 be assessed for one offense or civil infraction, and if the point values
19 differ, points must be assessed for the offense or civil infraction
20 having the greater point value. Details of the violation must be
21 submitted to the Department by the court where the conviction or
22 finding is obtained. The Department may provide for a graduated
23 system of demerits within each category of violations according to
24 the extent to which the traffic law was violated.
25 Sec. 2. Chapter 484A of NRS is hereby amended by adding
26 thereto a new section to read as follows:
27 1. A governmental entity may authorize the installation and
28 use of an automated traffic enforcement system to enforce the

14 484A.7035 for a violation described in subsection 1 which was
15 detected by an automated traffic enforcement system, the evidence
16 of the violation from the automated traffic enforcement system
17 must be reviewed for accuracy by a peace officer of a law
18 enforcement agency with jurisdiction over the location of the
19 automated traffic enforcement system.
20 5. A civil infraction citation issued pursuant to NRS
21 484A.7035 for a violation described in subsection 1 which was
22 detected by an automated traffic enforcement system must be sent
23 by the law enforcement agency described in subsection 4 by first
24 class mail to the address listed with the Department for the
25 registered owner of the vehicle identified by the automated traffic
26 enforcement system.
27 6. In addition to the information required pursuant to
28 subsection 1 of NRS 484A.7035, a civil infraction citation issued

27 enforcement system is installed and in use if the peace officer
28 witnesses a violation. A person who is given a civil infraction
29 citation by a peace officer pursuant to this subsection must not be

29 driver’s license and a brief description of the person’s physical
30 appearance. This information must be maintained in a record for
31 offenses kept at the traffic enforcement agency which employs that
32 officer.
33 2. Whenever a police officer stops a driver of a motor vehicle
34 for any violation of chapters 484A to 484E, inclusive, of NRS and

37 compare not only the driver’s name but also the number of his or her
38 driver’s license and physical description with any information

29 NRS 176.059, 176.0611, 176.0613 and 176.0623 in the amount that
30 the person would be required to pay if the civil penalty were a fine
31 imposed on a defendant who pleads guilty or guilty but mentally ill
32 or is found guilty or guilty but mentally ill of a misdemeanor. If, in
33 lieu of a civil penalty, the court authorizes a person to successfully
34 complete a course of traffic safety approved by the Department of
35 Motor Vehicles, the court must order the person to pay the amount
36 of the administrative assessment that corresponds to the civil penalty

10 assessments pursuant to this section, order the person to successfully
11 complete a course of traffic safety approved by the Department of
12 Motor Vehicles.
13 (b) Waive or reduce the civil penalty that a person who is found
14 to have committed a civil infraction would otherwise be required to
15 pay if the court determines that any circumstances warrant such a
16 waiver or reduction.
17 (c) Reduce any moving violation for which a person was issued
18 a civil infraction citation to a nonmoving violation if the court
19 determines that any circumstances warrant such a reduction.

S.B. 415
SENATE BILL NO. 415–COMMITTEE ON
GROWTH AND INFRASTRUCTURE
(ON BEHALF OF THE JOINT INTERIM STANDING COMMITTEE
ON GROWTH AND INFRASTRUCTURE)
MARCH 20, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Growth and Infrastructure
SUMMARY—Authorizes the installation and use of an automated
traffic enforcement system under certain
circumstances. (BDR 43-422)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public safety; authorizing the installation and
use of an automated traffic enforcement system by a
governmental entity under certain circumstances; setting
forth the requirements for the installation and use of an
automated traffic enforcement system; establishing
provisions governing the issuance of a civil infraction
citation based on evidence detected by an automated
traffic enforcement system; requiring the Department of
Transportation to adopt certain regulations; requiring the
Advisory Committee on Traffic Safety to provide certain
recommendations to the Department; prohibiting an
insurer from increasing rates for motor vehicle insurance
under certain circumstances; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits a governmental entity or any agent thereof from using
2 photographic, video or digital equipment to gather evidence in order to issue a
3 traffic citation or civil infraction citation, unless the equipment is: (1) a portable
4 camera or event recording device worn or held by a peace officer; (2) installed
5 within a vehicle or facility of a law enforcement agency; or (3) privately owned by
6 a nongovernmental entity. (NRS 484A.600) Sections 2 and 3 of this bill create an
7 exception to this prohibition, authorizing a governmental entity to allow for the
-
*SB415*

– 2 –
8 installation and use of an automated traffic enforcement system to enforce
9 provisions of law governing speeding and obedience to traffic-control devices
10 under certain circumstances. Specifically, section 2 requires the governmental
11 entity to: (1) make certain findings about the location where the automated traffic
12 enforcement system will be installed; (2) provide for or undertake a public
13 information campaign about the automated traffic enforcement system; and (3)
14 comply with certain regulations required to be adopted by the Department of
15 Transportation related to automated traffic enforcement system and warning signs.
16 Section 7 of this bill requires the Advisory Committee on Traffic Safety to provide
17 recommendations to the Department related to these regulations.
18 If a governmental entity authorizes the installation and use of an automated
19 traffic enforcement system, section 2 requires a peace officer of a law enforcement
20 agency with jurisdiction over the location of the automated traffic enforcement
21 system to review the evidence of a violation detected by an automated traffic
22 enforcement system before a civil infraction citation is issued. Section 2 also
23 establishes requirements for the contents and delivery of the civil infraction citation
24 issued based upon evidence collected by an automated traffic enforcement system.
25 Section 2 creates a rebuttable presumption that the registered owner of a vehicle is
26 the driver of the vehicle at the time of a violation detected by an automated traffic
27 enforcement system and provides a method for rebutting this presumption.
28 Section 2 provides that a violation detected by an automated traffic
29 enforcement system is not a moving traffic violation but is punishable by a civil
30 penalty. Additionally, section 2 requires money received from such civil penalties
31 to be used for certain purposes related to defraying the costs of the automated
32 traffic enforcement system. Section 6 of this bill makes a conforming change
33 related to the deposit of money received from such civil penalties.
34 Sections 1, 4 and 5 of this bill make conforming changes to: (1) exclude traffic
35 violations detected by an automated traffic enforcement system from an assessment
36 of demerit points; and (2) provide for the issuance of a civil infraction citation for
37 violations detected by an automated traffic enforcement system.
38 Existing law prohibits an insurer from increasing insurance rates or cancelling
39 or refusing to renew an insurance policy if a juvenile court enters a conviction or
40 finding of certain violations relating to speeding. (NRS 690B.028) Section 8 of this
41 bill additionally prohibits a civil infraction citation issued for a violation detected
42 by an automated traffic enforcement system from being used for such purposes.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 483.473 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 483.473 1. As used in this section, “traffic violation” means
3 conviction of a moving traffic violation in any municipal court,
4 justice court or district court in this State or a finding by any
5 municipal court or justice court in this State that a person has
6 committed a civil infraction pursuant to NRS 484A.703 to
7 484A.705, inclusive. The term includes a finding by a juvenile court
8 that a child has violated a traffic law or ordinance other than one
9 governing standing or parking. The term does not include [a] :
10 (a) A conviction or a finding by a juvenile court of a violation of
11 the speed limit posted by a public authority under the circumstances
12 described in subsection 1 of NRS 484B.617 [.] ; or
-
*SB415*

– 3 –
1 (b) A civil infraction citation issued for a violation detected by
2 an automated traffic enforcement system pursuant to section 2 of
3 this act.
4 2. The Department shall establish a uniform system of demerit
5 points for various traffic violations occurring within this State
6 affecting the driving privilege of any person who holds a driver’s
7 license issued by the Department and persons deemed to have future
8 driving privileges pursuant to NRS 483.447. The system must be
9 based on the accumulation of demerits during a period of 12
10 months.
11 3. The system must be uniform in its operation, and the
12 Department shall set up a schedule of demerits for each traffic
13 violation, depending upon the gravity of the violation, on a scale of
14 one demerit point for a minor violation of any traffic law to eight
15 demerit points for an extremely serious violation of the law
16 governing traffic violations. If a conviction of two or more traffic
17 violations committed on a single occasion is obtained, points must
18 be assessed for one offense or civil infraction, and if the point values
19 differ, points must be assessed for the offense or civil infraction
20 having the greater point value. Details of the violation must be
21 submitted to the Department by the court where the conviction or
22 finding is obtained. The Department may provide for a graduated
23 system of demerits within each category of violations according to
24 the extent to which the traffic law was violated.
25 Sec. 2. Chapter 484A of NRS is hereby amended by adding
26 thereto a new section to read as follows:
27 1. A governmental entity may authorize the installation and
28 use of an automated traffic enforcement system to enforce the
29 provisions of NRS 484B.300, 484B.307 and 484B.600, and any
30 corresponding traffic regulation, as provided in this section.
31 2. Before a governmental entity may authorize the
32 installation and use of an automated traffic enforcement system,
33 the governmental entity must make a finding that each location
34 selected for the use of the automated traffic enforcement system is
35 a location where:
36 (a) Traditional traffic enforcement methods have failed to
37 deter violations described in subsection 1;
38 (b) There is a high rate of violations described in subsection 1;
39 or
40 (c) There is a high rate of traffic crashes because of violations
41 described in subsection 1.
42 3. An automated traffic enforcement system may not be used
43 to enforce violations described in subsection 1 unless:
44 (a) The governmental entity that authorized the installation
45 and use of the automated traffic enforcement system provides for
-
*SB415*

– 4 –
1 or undertakes, not less than 30 days before any civil infraction
2 citation is issued for a violation described in subsection 1 which is
3 detected by the automated traffic enforcement system, a public
4 information campaign designed to inform persons of the presence
5 of the automated traffic enforcement system;
6 (b) The automated traffic enforcement system meets the
7 requirements for such a system set forth in regulations adopted by
8 the Department of Transportation; and
9 (c) There are warning signs installed not more than 300 feet
10 from the location of the automated traffic enforcement system.
11 The signs must meet the requirements for such signs set forth in
12 regulations adopted by the Department of Transportation.
13 4. Before a civil infraction citation is issued pursuant to NRS
14 484A.7035 for a violation described in subsection 1 which was
15 detected by an automated traffic enforcement system, the evidence
16 of the violation from the automated traffic enforcement system
17 must be reviewed for accuracy by a peace officer of a law
18 enforcement agency with jurisdiction over the location of the
19 automated traffic enforcement system.
20 5. A civil infraction citation issued pursuant to NRS
21 484A.7035 for a violation described in subsection 1 which was
22 detected by an automated traffic enforcement system must be sent
23 by the law enforcement agency described in subsection 4 by first
24 class mail to the address listed with the Department for the
25 registered owner of the vehicle identified by the automated traffic
26 enforcement system.
27 6. In addition to the information required pursuant to
28 subsection 1 of NRS 484A.7035, a civil infraction citation issued
29 pursuant to NRS 484A.7035 for a violation described in subsection
30 1 which was detected by an automated traffic enforcement system
31 must include:
32 (a) The date and time of the violation;
33 (b) An image taken by the automated traffic enforcement
34 system showing the vehicle and vehicle license plate involved in
35 the violation or the address of the Internet website on which such
36 an image may be viewed; and
37 (c) A statement summarizing the provisions of subsection 7.
38 7. The registered owner of a vehicle is presumed to be the
39 driver of the vehicle at the time of a violation described in
40 subsection 1 which was detected by an automated traffic
41 enforcement system. Such a presumption may be rebutted if the
42 registered owner of the vehicle presents as evidence at a hearing
43 held pursuant to subsection 3 of NRS 484A.704, an affidavit
44 stating:
-
*SB415*

– 5 –
1 (a) The name and address of the person having care, custody
2 and control of the vehicle at the time of the violation; or
3 (b) That the vehicle, at the time of the violation, was stolen.
4 Such an affidavit must be accompanied by evidence that supports
5 the affidavit, including, without limitation, a police report or an
6 insurance report.
7 8. If a civil infraction citation is issued pursuant to NRS
8 484A.7035 for a violation described in subsection 1 which was
9 detected by an automated traffic enforcement system, the
10 violation:
11 (a) Is not a moving traffic violation under NRS 483.473; and
12 (b) Is punishable by a civil penalty of not more than $100.
13 9. Any money collected as a civil penalty pursuant to
14 paragraph (b) of subsection 8 must be accounted for separately in
15 the county or city treasury or State General Fund, as applicable, to
16 the law enforcement agency described in subsection 4 and used to
17 defray the cost of:
18 (a) Installing and operating an automated traffic enforcement
19 system, including, without limitation, the costs of administering
20 the provisions of this section; and
21 (b) Traffic safety programs, including, without limitation,

23 improvements related to traffic safety.
24 10. The provisions of this section do not prohibit a peace
25 officer from issuing a civil infraction citation for a violation of
26 any law of this State at the place where an automated traffic
27 enforcement system is installed and in use if the peace officer
28 witnesses a violation. A person who is given a civil infraction
29 citation by a peace officer pursuant to this subsection must not be
30 issued a civil infraction citation based on evidence from the
31 automated traffic enforcement system for the same violation for
32 which the peace officer issued the person the civil infraction
33 citation.
34 11. The Department of Transportation shall adopt
35 regulations setting forth requirements for an automated traffic
36 enforcement system. Such regulations must include, without
37 limitation:

– 6 –
1 or other recorded image of a vehicle and a vehicle license plate
2 which is used as evidence of a violation of a traffic law by the
3 driver of the vehicle. Such a photograph or other recorded image
4 must not include any depiction of the driver of the vehicle.
5 (b) “Corresponding traffic regulation” means a traffic
6 regulation enacted by ordinance by the governing body of a city or
7 county pursuant to NRS 484A.400 that prohibits the same conduct
8 prohibited by NRS 484B.300, 484B.307 or 484B.600, respectively.
9 (c) “Governmental entity” means:
10 (1) The governing body of a city or county; or
11 (2) The Department of Public Safety.
12 Sec. 3. NRS 484A.600 is hereby amended to read as follows:
13 484A.600 [A] Except as otherwise provided in section 2 of
14 this act, a governmental entity and any agent thereof shall not use
15 photographic, video or digital equipment for gathering evidence to
16 be used for the issuance of a traffic citation or civil infraction
17 citation pursuant to NRS 484A.7035 for a violation of chapters
18 484A to 484E, inclusive, of NRS unless the equipment is a portable
19 camera or event recording device worn or held by a peace officer,
20 the equipment is otherwise installed temporarily or permanently
21 within a vehicle or facility of a law enforcement agency or the
22 equipment is privately owned by a nongovernmental entity.
23 Sec. 4. NRS 484A.640 is hereby amended to read as follows:
24 484A.640 1. Except for a citation issued pursuant to NRS
25 484A.700 [,] or section 2 of this act, whenever a police officer
26 makes an arrest or issues a citation to a person for any violation of
27 chapters 484A to 484E, inclusive, of NRS, the police officer shall
28 record the name as given by that person, the number of the person’s
29 driver’s license and a brief description of the person’s physical
30 appearance. This information must be maintained in a record for
31 offenses kept at the traffic enforcement agency which employs that
32 officer.
33 2. Whenever a police officer stops a driver of a motor vehicle
34 for any violation of chapters 484A to 484E, inclusive, of NRS and
35 requests information from a traffic enforcement agency concerning
36 that person’s record of prior offenses, the police officer shall
37 compare not only the driver’s name but also the number of his or her
38 driver’s license and physical description with any information
39 obtained from the agency as a result of the request. If the
40 information received from the agency indicates that the driver’s
41 name is on an outstanding warrant for a prior offense, the officer
42 shall not arrest the driver for that prior offense unless the additional
43 information used for comparison also connects the driver with that
44 prior offense.

1 Sec. 5. NRS 484A.704 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 484A.704 1. Any person who receives a civil infraction
3 citation pursuant to NRS 484A.7035 or 484A.7049 or section 2 of
4 this act shall respond to the citation as provided in this section not
5 later than 90 calendar days after the date on which the citation is
6 issued.
7 2. If a person receiving a civil infraction citation does not
8 contest the determination that the person has committed the civil
9 infraction set forth in the citation, the person must respond to the
10 citation by indicating that the person does not contest the
11 determination and submitting full payment of the monetary penalty,
12 the administrative assessment and any fees to the court specified in
13 the citation, or its traffic violations bureau, in person, by mail or
14 through the Internet or other electronic means.
15 3. If a person receiving a civil infraction citation wishes to
16 contest the determination that the person has committed the civil
17 infraction set forth in the citation, the person must respond by
18 requesting in person, by mail or through the Internet or other
19 electronic means a hearing for that purpose. The court shall notify
20 the person in writing of the time, place and date of the hearing,
21 but the date of the hearing must not be earlier than 9 calendar days
22 after the court provides notice of the hearing.
23 4. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, not less
24 than 30 days before the deadline for a person to respond to a civil
25 infraction citation, the court must send to the address or electronic
26 mail address of the person, as indicated on the civil infraction
27 citation issued to the person, a reminder that the person must
28 respond to the civil infraction citation within 90 calendar days after
29 the date on which the civil infraction citation is issued. If the person
30 agreed to receive communications relating to the civil infraction by
31 text message, the court may send such a notice to the telephone
32 number of the person as indicated on the civil infraction citation. If
33 the person does not respond to the civil infraction citation in the
34 manner specified by subsection 2 or 3 within 90 calendar days after
35 the date on which the civil infraction citation is issued, the court
36 must enter an order pursuant to NRS 484A.7043 finding that the
37 person committed the civil infraction and assessing the monetary
38 penalty and administrative assessments prescribed for the civil
39 infraction. A person who has been issued a civil infraction citation
40 and who fails to respond to the civil infraction citation as required
41 by this section may not appeal an order entered pursuant to this
42 section.
43 5. If any person issued a civil infraction citation fails to appear
44 at a hearing requested pursuant to subsection 3, the court must enter
45 an order pursuant to NRS 484A.7043 finding that the person
-
*SB415*

– 8 –
1 committed the civil infraction and assessing the monetary penalty
2 and administrative assessments prescribed for the civil infraction. A
3 person who has been issued a civil infraction citation and who fails
4 to appear at a hearing requested pursuant to subsection 3 may not
5 appeal an order entered pursuant to this subsection.
6 6. In addition to any other penalty imposed, any person who is
7 found by the court to have committed a civil infraction pursuant to
8 subsection 5 shall pay the witness fees, per diem allowances, travel
9 expenses and other reimbursement in accordance with NRS 50.225.
10 7. If a court has established a system pursuant to NRS
11 484A.615, any person issued a civil infraction citation may, if
12 authorized by the court, use the system to perform any applicable
13 actions pursuant to this section.
14 Sec. 6. NRS 484A.7043 is hereby amended to read as follows:
15 484A.7043 1. Except as otherwise provided in this section [,]
16 and section 2 of this act, a person who is found to have committed a
17 civil infraction shall be punished by a civil penalty of not more than
18 $500 per violation unless a greater civil penalty is authorized by
19 specific statute. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 484A.792 [,]
20 and section 2 of this act, any civil penalty collected pursuant to
21 NRS 484A.703 to 484A.705, inclusive, must be paid to:
22 (a) The treasurer of the city in which the civil infraction
23 occurred; or
24 (b) If the civil infraction did not occur in a city, the treasurer of
25 the county in which the civil infraction occurred.
26 2. If a person is found to have committed a civil infraction, in
27 addition to any civil penalty imposed on the person, the court shall
28 order the person to pay the administrative assessments set forth in
29 NRS 176.059, 176.0611, 176.0613 and 176.0623 in the amount that
30 the person would be required to pay if the civil penalty were a fine
31 imposed on a defendant who pleads guilty or guilty but mentally ill
32 or is found guilty or guilty but mentally ill of a misdemeanor. If, in
33 lieu of a civil penalty, the court authorizes a person to successfully
34 complete a course of traffic safety approved by the Department of
35 Motor Vehicles, the court must order the person to pay the amount
36 of the administrative assessment that corresponds to the civil penalty
37 for which the defendant would have otherwise been responsible.
38 The administrative assessments imposed pursuant to this subsection
39 must be collected and distributed in the same manner as the
40 administrative assessments imposed and collected pursuant to NRS
41 176.059, 176.0611, 176.0613 and 176.0623.
42 3. If the court determines that a civil penalty or administrative
43 assessment imposed pursuant to this section is:
-
*SB415*

– 9 –
1 (a) Excessive in relation to the financial resources of the
2 defendant, the court may waive or reduce the monetary penalty
3 accordingly.
4 (b) Not within the defendant’s present financial ability to pay,
5 the court may enter into a payment plan with the person.
