Ethical Standards, Require Training and Prohibit and Sanction
Ethical Breaches.

Section 128:
1. The Senate and Assembly hereby find and declare that:
(a) Section 6 of Article 4 of the Nevada Constitution invests
each House with plenary and exclusive constitutional powers to
govern, control and regulate its membership and its internal
organization, affairs and management, expressly providing that:
“Each House shall judge of the qualifications, elections and
returns of its own members, choose its own officers (except the
President of the Senate), determine the rules of its proceedings
and may punish its members for disorderly conduct, and with the
concurrence of two thirds of all the members elected, expel a
member.” (Heller v. Legislature, 120 Nev. 456 (2004);
Commission on Ethics v. Hardy, 125 Nev. 285 (2009); Mason’s
Manual of Legislative Procedure §§ 2-3 and 560-564 (2010)
(Mason’s Manual))
(b) Section 7 of Article 4 of the Nevada Constitution invests
each House with plenary and exclusive constitutional powers to
govern, control and regulate any person who is not a member but
who is guilty of disrespect to the House by disorderly or
contemptuous behavior in its presence, and each House also has
inherent powers, according to the common parliamentary law, to
prohibit and sanction all offensive behavior committed against it
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 29 –
by any person who is not a member. (Mason’s Manual §§ 805-
806; Luther S. Cushing, Elements of the Law & Practice of
Legislative Assemblies §§ 690-695 (1856) (Cushing’s Legislative
Assemblies))
(c) In addition to its other powers, each House possesses
certain inherent powers of institutional self-protection and self-
preservation to govern, control and regulate its membership and
its internal organization, affairs and management. (In re
Chapman, 166 U.S. 661, 668 (1897); Mason’s Manual § 2;
Cushing’s Legislative Assemblies § 533)
(d) The inherent powers of each House are considered “so
essential to the authority of a legislative assembly, that it cannot
well exist without them; and they are consequently entitled to be
regarded as belonging to every such assembly as a necessary
incident.” (Cushing’s Legislative Assemblies § 533)
(e) The inherent powers of each House authorize it to take all
necessary and proper institutional actions that are “recognized by
the common parliamentary law.” (Cushing’s Legislative
Assemblies § 684)
(f) Thus, it is well established that each House is “vested with
all the powers and privileges which are necessary and incidental to
a free and unobstructed exercise of its appropriate functions.
These powers and privileges are derived not from the Constitution;
on the contrary, they arise from the very creation of a legislative
body, and are founded upon the principle of self-preservation.”
(Ex parte McCarthy, 29 Cal. 395, 403 (1866))

Section 129:
2. The Senate and Assembly hereby exercise their
constitutional and inherent powers and privileges and adopt the
Legislative Code of Ethical Standards in the Joint Standing Rules

the other, and not receded from by the one making the
amendment, each House may appoint a committee to confer with a
like committee to be appointed by the other; and, if appointed, the
committee shall meet publicly at a convenient hour to be agreed
upon by their respective chairs and announced publicly, and shall
confer upon the differences between the two Houses as indicated
by the amendments made in one and rejected in the other and
report as early as convenient the result of their conference to their
respective Houses.
2. The report shall be made available to all members of both
Houses. The whole subject matter embraced in the bill or
resolution shall be considered by the committee, and it may
recommend recession by either House, new amendments, a new
bill or resolution, or other changes as it sees fit. A new bill or
resolution so reported shall be treated as amendments unless the
bill or resolution is composed entirely of original matter, in which
case it shall receive the treatment required in the respective
Houses for original bills, or resolutions, as the case may be. A

Rule No. 5. Joint Sponsorship.
1. A bill or resolution introduced by a standing committee of
the Senate or Assembly may, at the direction of the chair of the
committee, set forth the name of a standing committee of the other
House as a joint sponsor, if a majority of all members appointed to
the committee of the other House votes in favor of becoming a
joint sponsor of the bill or resolution. The name of the committee
joint sponsor must be set forth on the face of the bill or resolution
immediately below the date on which the bill or resolution is

submitted to the front desk of the House of origin or the statement
required by subsection 5. The Legislative Counsel shall not cause
-

– 4 –
to be printed the name of a Legislator as a primary joint sponsor

bills and resolutions of the same House of origin are numbered.
5. Once a bill or resolution has been introduced, a primary
joint sponsor or non-primary joint sponsor may only be added or

submitted to the front desk of the House of origin of the
amendment. If the amendment proposes to add or remove a
Legislator as a primary joint sponsor or non-primary joint
sponsor, the statement must be signed by that Legislator. If the
amendment proposes to add or remove a standing committee as a
joint sponsor, the statement must be signed by the chair of the
committee. A copy of the statement must be transmitted to the
Legislative Counsel if the amendment is adopted.
6. An amendment that proposes to add or remove a primary

discipline such a member for violations of any rules or policies, is
at the sole discretion of the Majority Leader of the Senate and the
Speaker of the Assembly.
7. The Legislative Counsel Bureau shall act as the
administrative liaison between any applicants or accredited
members of a bona fide news medium and the Senate and
Assembly for purposes of accepting and processing applications
for accreditation, preparing and regulating identification badges
and administering any other matters necessary to carry out the
provisions of this Rule, but such actions by the Legislative
Counsel Bureau do not affect the authority of the Senate and
Assembly to govern their own chambers or otherwise determine
privileges of the floor.
8. A person is disqualified and barred from being accredited
as a member of a bona fide news medium if the person registers as
a lobbyist or engages in any lobbying activities that would require
the person to register as a lobbyist during any regular or special
session pursuant to chapter 218H of NRS, regardless of whether
the person properly registers or fails to register as a lobbyist as
required by that chapter. If a person is accredited as a member of
a bona fide news medium and thereafter registers as a lobbyist or
engages in any lobbying activities that would require the person to
register as a lobbyist during any regular or special session
pursuant to chapter 218H of NRS, regardless of whether the
person properly registers or fails to register as a lobbyist as
required by that chapter, the person shall be deemed to have
forfeited the person’s accreditation, and the person must return

3. The Legislative Code of Ethical Standards is intended to
supplement all other ethical standards recognized by rules and
laws governing ethics and does not limit the application of such
other ethical standards but is cumulative thereto, so that the

standards does not bar the application or attempted application of
any other, except in circumstances where Section 6 of Article 4 of
the Nevada Constitution invests each House with plenary and
exclusive constitutional powers.
4. The Legislative Code of Ethical Standards does not create

2. The Legislative Code of Ethical Standards must be
construed:
(a) Liberally to carry out and achieve its purposes; and
(b) Strictly against any person alleging that his or her conduct
is not subject to its provisions, so that any doubt or uncertainty as
to the application of its provisions must be resolved against such a
person and in favor of removing unethical behavior from the
legislative process.
Rule No. 32. Definitions.

1. The people of the State of Nevada have the right to expect
and demand that each Legislator, member of legislative staff or
lobbyist adheres to the highest standards of ethical behavior
founded upon principles of dignity, decorum, civility and respect
because such ethical standards are essential to ensure and
enhance the people’s faith, trust and confidence in the integrity of
the legislative process.
2. Each Legislator, member of legislative staff or lobbyist has
a solemn and unerring responsibility and duty to do everything in
his or her power to:
(a) Behave properly, appropriately and honorably with each

(b) Encourage, promote and secure an atmosphere in which
ethical behavior is the highest priority and is practiced

Legislative Code of Ethical Standards in accordance with the
Standing Rules of each House, except that a person may not file a
complaint alleging the same or substantially similar conduct with
more than one House.
2. If the complaint alleges an ethical breach by or against a
Legislator or the ethical breach otherwise involves a particular
Legislator, the complaint must be filed with the Legislator’s
House, even if the complaint also alleges an ethical breach by or
against a member of legislative staff or a lobbyist.
Rule No. 39. Authority of Senate and Assembly to Adopt
Ethical Standards, Require Training and Prohibit and Sanction
Ethical Breaches.
1. The Senate and Assembly hereby find and declare that:
(a) Section 6 of Article 4 of the Nevada Constitution invests
each House with plenary and exclusive constitutional powers to
govern, control and regulate its membership and its internal
organization, affairs and management, expressly providing that:
“Each House shall judge of the qualifications, elections and
returns of its own members, choose its own officers (except the
President of the Senate), determine the rules of its proceedings
and may punish its members for disorderly conduct, and with the
concurrence of two thirds of all the members elected, expel a
member.” (Heller v. Legislature, 120 Nev. 456 (2004);
Commission on Ethics v. Hardy, 125 Nev. 285 (2009); Mason’s
Manual of Legislative Procedure §§ 2-3 and 560-564 (2010)
(Mason’s Manual))
(b) Section 7 of Article 4 of the Nevada Constitution invests
each House with plenary and exclusive constitutional powers to
govern, control and regulate any person who is not a member but
who is guilty of disrespect to the House by disorderly or
contemptuous behavior in its presence, and each House also has
inherent powers, according to the common parliamentary law, to
prohibit and sanction all offensive behavior committed against it
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 29 –
by any person who is not a member. (Mason’s Manual §§ 805-
806; Luther S. Cushing, Elements of the Law & Practice of
Legislative Assemblies §§ 690-695 (1856) (Cushing’s Legislative
Assemblies))
(c) In addition to its other powers, each House possesses
certain inherent powers of institutional self-protection and self-
preservation to govern, control and regulate its membership and
its internal organization, affairs and management. (In re
Chapman, 166 U.S. 661, 668 (1897); Mason’s Manual § 2;
Cushing’s Legislative Assemblies § 533)
(d) The inherent powers of each House are considered “so
essential to the authority of a legislative assembly, that it cannot
well exist without them; and they are consequently entitled to be
regarded as belonging to every such assembly as a necessary
incident.” (Cushing’s Legislative Assemblies § 533)
(e) The inherent powers of each House authorize it to take all
necessary and proper institutional actions that are “recognized by
the common parliamentary law.” (Cushing’s Legislative
Assemblies § 684)
(f) Thus, it is well established that each House is “vested with
all the powers and privileges which are necessary and incidental to
a free and unobstructed exercise of its appropriate functions.
These powers and privileges are derived not from the Constitution;
on the contrary, they arise from the very creation of a legislative
body, and are founded upon the principle of self-preservation.”
(Ex parte McCarthy, 29 Cal. 395, 403 (1866))
2. The Senate and Assembly hereby exercise their
constitutional and inherent powers and privileges and adopt the
Legislative Code of Ethical Standards in the Joint Standing Rules
to:
(a) Establish ethical standards to regulate the behavior and
conduct of persons who participate in the legislative process; and
(b) Prohibit and sanction ethical breaches.
3. The Majority Leader of the Senate and the Speaker of the
Assembly, respectively, may require Legislators to attend training
relating to the ethical standards required, and the behaviors
prohibited, by the Legislative Code of Ethical Standards and
sanction a Legislator for failure to attend such a training.

The Joint Standing Rules set forth herein shall remain in full
force and effect throughout the interim between regular sessions
of the Legislature and until new Joint Standing Rules of the

newly-constituted Legislature at the commencement of a session,
unless a conflict exists with a rule adopted by the Senate and
Assembly for a special session occurring between regular sessions.
And be it further
RESOLVED, That this resolution becomes effective upon
adoption, except that any persons who were issued press
identification badges for the 83rd Session of the Legislature before
February 3, 2025, and whose names are read or entered into the

representatives on that date shall be deemed to be accredited
members of a bona fide news medium for the purposes of Joint
Standing Rule No. 25.
