4 ANTI-HARASSMENT POLICY
5
6 Rule No. 20. Maintenance of Working Environment;
7 Procedure for Filing, Investigating and Taking Remedial Action
8 on Complaints.
9 1. The Legislature hereby declares that it is the policy of the
10 Legislature to prohibit any conduct, whether intentional or
11 unintentional, which results in sexual harassment or other
12 unlawful harassment based upon any other protected category.
13 The Legislature intends to maintain a working environment which
14 is free from sexual harassment and other unlawful harassment.
15 Each Legislator is responsible to conduct himself or herself in a
16 manner which will ensure that others are able to work in such an
17 environment.
18 2. In accordance with Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of
19 1964, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e et seq., for the purposes of this Rule,
20 “sexual harassment” means unwelcome sexual advances, requests
21 for sexual favors, and other verbal, visual or physical conduct of a
22 sexual nature when:
23 (a) Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or
24 implicitly a term or condition of a person’s employment;
25 (b) Submission to or rejection of such conduct by a person is
26 used as the basis for employment decisions affecting the person;
27 or
28 (c) Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably
29 interfering with a person’s work performance or creating an
30 intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment.
31 3. Each Legislator must exercise his or her own good
32 judgment to avoid engaging in conduct that may be perceived by
33 others as sexual harassment. The following noninclusive list
34 provides illustrations of conduct that the Legislature deems to be
35 inappropriate:
36 (a) Verbal conduct such as epithets, derogatory comments,
37 slurs or unwanted sexual advances, invitations or comments;
38 (b) Visual conduct such as derogatory posters, photography,
39 cartoons, drawings or gestures;
40 (c) Physical conduct such as unwanted touching, blocking
41 normal movement or interfering with the work directed at a person
42 because of his or her sex; and
43 (d) Threats and demands to submit to sexual requests to keep a
44 person’s job or avoid some other loss, and offers of employment
45 benefits in return for sexual favors.
-
*ACR1*
– 18 –
1 4. In addition to other prohibited conduct, a complaint may
2 be brought pursuant to this Rule for engaging in conduct
3 prohibited by Joint Standing Rule No. 37 when the prohibited
4 conduct is based on or because of the gender or other protected
5 category of the person.
6 5. Retaliation against a person for engaging in protected
7 activity is prohibited. Retaliation occurs when an adverse action is
8 taken against a person which is reasonably likely to deter the
9 person from engaging in the protected activity. Protected activity
10 includes, without limitation:
11 (a) Opposing conduct that the person reasonably believes
12 constitutes sexual harassment or other unlawful harassment;
13 (b) Filing a complaint about the conduct; or
14 (c) Testifying, assisting or participating in any manner in an
15 investigation or other proceeding related to a complaint of sexual
16 harassment or other unlawful harassment.
17 6. A Legislator who encounters conduct that the Legislator
18 believes is sexual harassment, other unlawful harassment,
19 retaliation or otherwise inconsistent with this policy may file a
20 written complaint with:
21 (a) The Speaker of the Assembly;
22 (b) The Majority Leader of the Senate;
23 (c) The Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau, if the
24 complaint involves the conduct of the Speaker of the Assembly or
25 the Majority Leader of the Senate; or
26 (d) The reporting system established pursuant to
27 subsection 11.
28  The complaint must include the details of the incident or
29 incidents, the names of the persons involved and the names of any
30 witnesses. Unless the Legislative Counsel is the subject of the
31 complaint, the Legislative Counsel must be informed upon receipt
32 of a complaint.
33 7. The Speaker of the Assembly, the Majority Leader of the
34 Senate or the Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau, as
35 appropriate, shall cause a discreet and impartial investigation to
36 be conducted and may, when deemed necessary and appropriate,
37 assign the complaint to a committee consisting of Legislators of
38 the appropriate House.
39 8. If the investigation reveals that sexual harassment, other
40 unlawful harassment, retaliation or other conduct in violation of
41 this policy has occurred, appropriate disciplinary or remedial
42 action, or both, will be taken. The appropriate persons will be
43 informed when any such action is taken. The Legislature will also
44 take any action necessary to deter any future harassment.
-
*ACR1*
– 19 –
1 9. The Legislature encourages a Legislator to report any
2 incident of sexual harassment, other unlawful harassment,
3 retaliation or other conduct inconsistent with this policy
4 immediately so that the complaint can be quickly and fairly
5 resolved.
6 10. All Legislators are responsible for adhering to the
7 provisions of this policy. The prohibitions against engaging in
8 sexual harassment and other unlawful harassment which are set
9 forth in this Rule also apply to employees, Legislators, lobbyists,
10 vendors, contractors, customers and any other visitors to the
11 Legislature.
12 11. The Legislative Counsel Bureau shall establish a
13 reporting system which allows a person to submit a complaint of a
14 violation of this Rule with or without identifying himself or
15 herself. Such a complaint must provide enough details of the
16 incident or incidents alleged, the names of the persons involved
17 and the names of any witnesses to allow an appropriate inquiry to
18 occur.
19 12. This policy does not create any private right of action or
20 enforceable legal rights in any person.
21
22 Rule No. 20.5. Lobbyists to Maintain Appropriate Working
23 Environment; Procedure for Filing, Investigating and Taking
24 Remedial Action on Complaints.
25 1. A lobbyist shall not engage in any conduct with a
26 Legislator or any other person working in the Legislature which is
27 prohibited by a Legislator under Joint Standing Rule No. 20. Each
28 lobbyist is responsible to conduct himself or herself in a manner
29 which will ensure that others who work in the Legislature are able
30 to work in an environment free from sexual harassment and other
31 unlawful harassment.
32 2. Each lobbyist must exercise his or her own good judgment
33 to avoid engaging in conduct that may be perceived by others as
34 sexual harassment as described in Joint Standing Rule No. 20.
35 3. A lobbyist who encounters conduct that he or she believes
36 is sexual harassment, other unlawful harassment, retaliation or
37 otherwise inconsistent with this policy may file a written complaint
38 with:
39 (a) The Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau; or
40 (b) The reporting system established pursuant to subsection 11
41 of Joint Standing Rule No. 20.
42  Such a complaint must include the details of the incident or

44 names of any witnesses. Unless the Legislative Counsel is the
-
*ACR1*
– 20 –
1 subject of the complaint, the Legislative Counsel must be informed
2 upon receipt of a complaint.
3 4. If a person encounters conduct by a lobbyist which he or
4 she believes is sexual harassment, other unlawful harassment,
5 retaliation or otherwise inconsistent with this policy, the person
6 may file a complaint in the manner listed in subsection 3, or may
7 submit a complaint in accordance with the reporting system
8 established pursuant to subsection 11 of Joint Standing Rule
9 No. 20.
10 5. If a complaint made against a lobbyist pursuant to this
11 Rule is substantiated, appropriate disciplinary action may be
12 brought against the lobbyist which may include, without
13 limitation, having his or her registration as a lobbyist suspended.
14 6. The provisions of this policy are not intended to address
15 conduct between lobbyists and must not be used for that purpose.
16 This policy does not create any private right of action or
17 enforceable legal rights in any person.

29 deemed sufficient by the Director to establish that the person
30 works for or represents a bona fide news medium.
31 (d) Any other information or evidence that the Director

33 3. In addition to the requirements of subsection 2, the

36 pursuant to chapter 218H of NRS and, to the best of the person’s

39 person to register as a lobbyist during any regular or special
40 session pursuant to chapter 218H of NRS.
41 (b) An acknowledgment that, if the person is accredited as a
42 member of a bona fide news medium and thereafter registers as a
43 lobbyist or engages in any lobbying activities that would require

– 22 –
1 the person properly registers or fails to register as a lobbyist as

35 provisions of this Rule, but such actions by the Legislative
36 Counsel Bureau do not affect the authority of the Senate and
37 Assembly to govern their own chambers or otherwise determine
38 privileges of the floor.
39 8. A person is disqualified and barred from being accredited
40 as a member of a bona fide news medium if the person registers as
41 a lobbyist or engages in any lobbying activities that would require

43 session pursuant to chapter 218H of NRS, regardless of whether
44 the person properly registers or fails to register as a lobbyist as

9 and demand that each Legislator, member of legislative staff or
10 lobbyist adheres to the highest standards of ethical behavior
11 founded upon principles of dignity, decorum, civility and respect
12 because such ethical standards are essential to ensure and
13 enhance the people’s faith, trust and confidence in the integrity of
14 the legislative process.
15 2. Each Legislator, member of legislative staff or lobbyist has
16 a solemn and unerring responsibility and duty to do everything in

18 (a) Behave properly, appropriately and honorably with each
19 other and with members of the public who participate in the
20 legislative process; and
21 (b) Encourage, promote and secure an atmosphere in which
22 ethical behavior is the highest priority and is practiced
23 unceasingly and without fail.
24 3. Each Legislator, member of legislative staff or lobbyist
25 shall not engage in or attempt, offer, or agree to engage in, or
26 assist or induce another person to engage in:

-
*ACR1*
– 27 –

2 against another person who is participating in the legislative
3 process.
4 (f) Involves dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.
5 (g) Is intended to assist or induce another person to violate or
6 attempt to violate the Legislative Code of Ethical Standards.
7
8 Rule No. 38. Complaints.
9 1. A person may file a complaint alleging a breach of the
10 Legislative Code of Ethical Standards in accordance with the
11 Standing Rules of each House, except that a person may not file a
12 complaint alleging the same or substantially similar conduct with
13 more than one House.
14 2. If the complaint alleges an ethical breach by or against a
15 Legislator or the ethical breach otherwise involves a particular
16 Legislator, the complaint must be filed with the Legislator’s
17 House, even if the complaint also alleges an ethical breach by or
18 against a member of legislative staff or a lobbyist.
19
20 Rule No. 39. Authority of Senate and Assembly to Adopt
21 Ethical Standards, Require Training and Prohibit and Sanction
22 Ethical Breaches.
23 1. The Senate and Assembly hereby find and declare that:
24 (a) Section 6 of Article 4 of the Nevada Constitution invests
25 each House with plenary and exclusive constitutional powers to
26 govern, control and regulate its membership and its internal
27 organization, affairs and management, expressly providing that:
28 “Each House shall judge of the qualifications, elections and
29 returns of its own members, choose its own officers (except the
30 President of the Senate), determine the rules of its proceedings
31 and may punish its members for disorderly conduct, and with the
32 concurrence of two thirds of all the members elected, expel a
33 member.” (Heller v. Legislature, 120 Nev. 456 (2004);
34 Commission on Ethics v. Hardy, 125 Nev. 285 (2009); Mason’s
35 Manual of Legislative Procedure §§ 2-3 and 560-564 (2010)
36 (Mason’s Manual))
37 (b) Section 7 of Article 4 of the Nevada Constitution invests
38 each House with plenary and exclusive constitutional powers to
39 govern, control and regulate any person who is not a member but
40 who is guilty of disrespect to the House by disorderly or
41 contemptuous behavior in its presence, and each House also has
42 inherent powers, according to the common parliamentary law, to
43 prohibit and sanction all offensive behavior committed against it
44 by any person who is not a member. (Mason’s Manual §§ 805-
45 806; Luther S. Cushing, Elements of the Law & Practice of
-
*ACR1*
– 28 –
1 Legislative Assemblies §§ 690-695 (1856) (Cushing’s Legislative
2 Assemblies))
3 (c) In addition to its other powers, each House possesses
4 certain inherent powers of institutional self-protection and self-
5 preservation to govern, control and regulate its membership and
6 its internal organization, affairs and management. (In re
7 Chapman, 166 U.S. 661, 668 (1897); Mason’s Manual § 2;
8 Cushing’s Legislative Assemblies § 533)
9 (d) The inherent powers of each House are considered “so
10 essential to the authority of a legislative assembly, that it cannot
11 well exist without them; and they are consequently entitled to be
12 regarded as belonging to every such assembly as a necessary
13 incident.” (Cushing’s Legislative Assemblies § 533)
14 (e) The inherent powers of each House authorize it to take all
15 necessary and proper institutional actions that are “recognized by
16 the common parliamentary law.” (Cushing’s Legislative
17 Assemblies § 684)
18 (f) Thus, it is well established that each House is “vested with
19 all the powers and privileges which are necessary and incidental to
20 a free and unobstructed exercise of its appropriate functions.
21 These powers and privileges are derived not from the Constitution;
22 on the contrary, they arise from the very creation of a legislative
23 body, and are founded upon the principle of self-preservation.”
24 (Ex parte McCarthy, 29 Cal. 395, 403 (1866))
25 2. The Senate and Assembly hereby exercise their
26 constitutional and inherent powers and privileges and adopt the
27 Legislative Code of Ethical Standards in the Joint Standing Rules
28 to:
29 (a) Establish ethical standards to regulate the behavior and
30 conduct of persons who participate in the legislative process; and
31 (b) Prohibit and sanction ethical breaches.
32 3. The Majority Leader of the Senate and the Speaker of the
33 Assembly, respectively, may require Legislators to attend training
34 relating to the ethical standards required, and the behaviors
35 prohibited, by the Legislative Code of Ethical Standards and
36 sanction a Legislator for failure to attend such a training.
37
38 CONTINUATION OF RULES
39
40 Rule No. 40. Continuation of Joint Standing Rules During the
41 Interim Between Regular Sessions.
42 The Joint Standing Rules set forth herein shall remain in full
43 force and effect throughout the interim between regular sessions
44 of the Legislature and until new Joint Standing Rules of the
45 Senate and Assembly are adopted as part of the organization of a
-
*ACR1*
– 29 –
1 newly-constituted Legislature at the commencement of a session,
2 unless a conflict exists with a rule adopted by the Senate and
3 Assembly for a special session occurring between regular sessions.
4
5 And be it further
6 RESOLVED, That this resolution becomes effective upon
7 adoption, except that any persons who were issued press
8 identification badges for the 83rd Session of the Legislature before
9 February 3, 2025, and whose names are read or entered into the
10 Journals of the Senate and Assembly as accredited press
11 representatives on that date shall be deemed to be accredited
12 members of a bona fide news medium for the purposes of Joint
13 Standing Rule No. 25.

5
6 Rule No. 20. Maintenance of Working Environment;
7 Procedure for Filing, Investigating and Taking Remedial Action
8 on Complaints.
9 1. The Legislature hereby declares that it is the policy of the
10 Legislature to prohibit any conduct, whether intentional or
11 unintentional, which results in sexual harassment or other
12 unlawful harassment based upon any other protected category.
13 The Legislature intends to maintain a working environment which
14 is free from sexual harassment and other unlawful harassment.
15 Each Legislator is responsible to conduct himself or herself in a
16 manner which will ensure that others are able to work in such an
17 environment.
18 2. In accordance with Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of
19 1964, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e et seq., for the purposes of this Rule,
20 “sexual harassment” means unwelcome sexual advances, requests
21 for sexual favors, and other verbal, visual or physical conduct of a
22 sexual nature when:
23 (a) Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or
24 implicitly a term or condition of a person’s employment;
25 (b) Submission to or rejection of such conduct by a person is
26 used as the basis for employment decisions affecting the person;
27 or
28 (c) Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably
29 interfering with a person’s work performance or creating an
30 intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment.
31 3. Each Legislator must exercise his or her own good
32 judgment to avoid engaging in conduct that may be perceived by
33 others as sexual harassment. The following noninclusive list
34 provides illustrations of conduct that the Legislature deems to be
35 inappropriate:
36 (a) Verbal conduct such as epithets, derogatory comments,
37 slurs or unwanted sexual advances, invitations or comments;
38 (b) Visual conduct such as derogatory posters, photography,
39 cartoons, drawings or gestures;
40 (c) Physical conduct such as unwanted touching, blocking
41 normal movement or interfering with the work directed at a person
42 because of his or her sex; and
43 (d) Threats and demands to submit to sexual requests to keep a
44 person’s job or avoid some other loss, and offers of employment
45 benefits in return for sexual favors.

1 4. In addition to other prohibited conduct, a complaint may
2 be brought pursuant to this Rule for engaging in conduct
3 prohibited by Joint Standing Rule No. 37 when the prohibited
4 conduct is based on or because of the gender or other protected
5 category of the person.
6 5. Retaliation against a person for engaging in protected
7 activity is prohibited. Retaliation occurs when an adverse action is
8 taken against a person which is reasonably likely to deter the
9 person from engaging in the protected activity. Protected activity
10 includes, without limitation:
11 (a) Opposing conduct that the person reasonably believes
12 constitutes sexual harassment or other unlawful harassment;
13 (b) Filing a complaint about the conduct; or
14 (c) Testifying, assisting or participating in any manner in an
15 investigation or other proceeding related to a complaint of sexual
16 harassment or other unlawful harassment.
17 6. A Legislator who encounters conduct that the Legislator
18 believes is sexual harassment, other unlawful harassment,
19 retaliation or otherwise inconsistent with this policy may file a
20 written complaint with:
21 (a) The Speaker of the Assembly;
22 (b) The Majority Leader of the Senate;

24 complaint involves the conduct of the Speaker of the Assembly or
25 the Majority Leader of the Senate; or
26 (d) The reporting system established pursuant to
27 subsection 11.
28  The complaint must include the details of the incident or
29 incidents, the names of the persons involved and the names of any
30 witnesses. Unless the Legislative Counsel is the subject of the
31 complaint, the Legislative Counsel must be informed upon receipt
32 of a complaint.
33 7. The Speaker of the Assembly, the Majority Leader of the
34 Senate or the Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau, as
35 appropriate, shall cause a discreet and impartial investigation to
36 be conducted and may, when deemed necessary and appropriate,
37 assign the complaint to a committee consisting of Legislators of
38 the appropriate House.
39 8. If the investigation reveals that sexual harassment, other
40 unlawful harassment, retaliation or other conduct in violation of
41 this policy has occurred, appropriate disciplinary or remedial
42 action, or both, will be taken. The appropriate persons will be

8 sexual harassment and other unlawful harassment which are set
9 forth in this Rule also apply to employees, Legislators, lobbyists,
10 vendors, contractors, customers and any other visitors to the
11 Legislature.
12 11. The Legislative Counsel Bureau shall establish a
13 reporting system which allows a person to submit a complaint of a
14 violation of this Rule with or without identifying himself or
15 herself. Such a complaint must provide enough details of the
16 incident or incidents alleged, the names of the persons involved
17 and the names of any witnesses to allow an appropriate inquiry to
18 occur.

26 Legislator or any other person working in the Legislature which is
27 prohibited by a Legislator under Joint Standing Rule No. 20. Each
28 lobbyist is responsible to conduct himself or herself in a manner
29 which will ensure that others who work in the Legislature are able
30 to work in an environment free from sexual harassment and other
31 unlawful harassment.
32 2. Each lobbyist must exercise his or her own good judgment
33 to avoid engaging in conduct that may be perceived by others as
34 sexual harassment as described in Joint Standing Rule No. 20.

36 is sexual harassment, other unlawful harassment, retaliation or

2 upon receipt of a complaint.
3 4. If a person encounters conduct by a lobbyist which he or
4 she believes is sexual harassment, other unlawful harassment,
5 retaliation or otherwise inconsistent with this policy, the person
6 may file a complaint in the manner listed in subsection 3, or may
7 submit a complaint in accordance with the reporting system
8 established pursuant to subsection 11 of Joint Standing Rule
9 No. 20.
10 5. If a complaint made against a lobbyist pursuant to this
11 Rule is substantiated, appropriate disciplinary action may be
12 brought against the lobbyist which may include, without
13 limitation, having his or her registration as a lobbyist suspended.
14 6. The provisions of this policy are not intended to address
15 conduct between lobbyists and must not be used for that purpose.

41 (b) An acknowledgment that, if the person is accredited as a
42 member of a bona fide news medium and thereafter registers as a

6 attempt to violate the Legislative Code of Ethical Standards.

8 Rule No. 38. Complaints.
9 1. A person may file a complaint alleging a breach of the
10 Legislative Code of Ethical Standards in accordance with the
11 Standing Rules of each House, except that a person may not file a
12 complaint alleging the same or substantially similar conduct with
13 more than one House.
14 2. If the complaint alleges an ethical breach by or against a
15 Legislator or the ethical breach otherwise involves a particular
16 Legislator, the complaint must be filed with the Legislator’s
17 House, even if the complaint also alleges an ethical breach by or
18 against a member of legislative staff or a lobbyist.
19
20 Rule No. 39. Authority of Senate and Assembly to Adopt
21 Ethical Standards, Require Training and Prohibit and Sanction
22 Ethical Breaches.
23 1. The Senate and Assembly hereby find and declare that:
24 (a) Section 6 of Article 4 of the Nevada Constitution invests
25 each House with plenary and exclusive constitutional powers to
26 govern, control and regulate its membership and its internal
27 organization, affairs and management, expressly providing that:
28 “Each House shall judge of the qualifications, elections and
29 returns of its own members, choose its own officers (except the
30 President of the Senate), determine the rules of its proceedings
31 and may punish its members for disorderly conduct, and with the
32 concurrence of two thirds of all the members elected, expel a
33 member.” (Heller v. Legislature, 120 Nev. 456 (2004);
34 Commission on Ethics v. Hardy, 125 Nev. 285 (2009); Mason’s
35 Manual of Legislative Procedure §§ 2-3 and 560-564 (2010)
36 (Mason’s Manual))
37 (b) Section 7 of Article 4 of the Nevada Constitution invests
38 each House with plenary and exclusive constitutional powers to
39 govern, control and regulate any person who is not a member but
40 who is guilty of disrespect to the House by disorderly or
41 contemptuous behavior in its presence, and each House also has
42 inherent powers, according to the common parliamentary law, to
43 prohibit and sanction all offensive behavior committed against it
44 by any person who is not a member. (Mason’s Manual §§ 805-
45 806; Luther S. Cushing, Elements of the Law & Practice of
-
*ACR1*

– 28 –
1 Legislative Assemblies §§ 690-695 (1856) (Cushing’s Legislative
2 Assemblies))
3 (c) In addition to its other powers, each House possesses
4 certain inherent powers of institutional self-protection and self-
5 preservation to govern, control and regulate its membership and
6 its internal organization, affairs and management. (In re
7 Chapman, 166 U.S. 661, 668 (1897); Mason’s Manual § 2;
8 Cushing’s Legislative Assemblies § 533)
9 (d) The inherent powers of each House are considered “so
10 essential to the authority of a legislative assembly, that it cannot
11 well exist without them; and they are consequently entitled to be
12 regarded as belonging to every such assembly as a necessary
13 incident.” (Cushing’s Legislative Assemblies § 533)
14 (e) The inherent powers of each House authorize it to take all
15 necessary and proper institutional actions that are “recognized by
16 the common parliamentary law.” (Cushing’s Legislative
17 Assemblies § 684)
18 (f) Thus, it is well established that each House is “vested with
19 all the powers and privileges which are necessary and incidental to
20 a free and unobstructed exercise of its appropriate functions.
21 These powers and privileges are derived not from the Constitution;
22 on the contrary, they arise from the very creation of a legislative
23 body, and are founded upon the principle of self-preservation.”
24 (Ex parte McCarthy, 29 Cal. 395, 403 (1866))
25 2. The Senate and Assembly hereby exercise their
26 constitutional and inherent powers and privileges and adopt the
27 Legislative Code of Ethical Standards in the Joint Standing Rules
28 to:
29 (a) Establish ethical standards to regulate the behavior and
30 conduct of persons who participate in the legislative process; and
31 (b) Prohibit and sanction ethical breaches.
32 3. The Majority Leader of the Senate and the Speaker of the
33 Assembly, respectively, may require Legislators to attend training
34 relating to the ethical standards required, and the behaviors
35 prohibited, by the Legislative Code of Ethical Standards and
36 sanction a Legislator for failure to attend such a training.

38 CONTINUATION OF RULES
39
40 Rule No. 40. Continuation of Joint Standing Rules During the
41 Interim Between Regular Sessions.
42 The Joint Standing Rules set forth herein shall remain in full
43 force and effect throughout the interim between regular sessions
44 of the Legislature and until new Joint Standing Rules of the
45 Senate and Assembly are adopted as part of the organization of a
-

1 newly-constituted Legislature at the commencement of a session,
2 unless a conflict exists with a rule adopted by the Senate and
3 Assembly for a special session occurring between regular sessions.

5 And be it further
6 RESOLVED, That this resolution becomes effective upon
7 adoption, except that any persons who were issued press
8 identification badges for the 83rd Session of the Legislature before
9 February 3, 2025, and whose names are read or entered into the
10 Journals of the Senate and Assembly as accredited press
11 representatives on that date shall be deemed to be accredited
12 members of a bona fide news medium for the purposes of Joint
13 Standing Rule No. 25.
