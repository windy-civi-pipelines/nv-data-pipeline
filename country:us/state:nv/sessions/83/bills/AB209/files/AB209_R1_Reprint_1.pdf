EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to crimes; providing immunity from criminal
liability for engaging in prostitution or solicitation for
prostitution under certain circumstances; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires a peace officer who detains, arrests or issues a citation to
2 a prostitute for a violation of the prohibition against unlawfully engaging in
3 prostitution or solicitation for prostitution to provide information relating to certain
4 assistance for which the prostitute might be eligible. Existing law also requires a
5 prosecuting attorney to dismiss the charge against a prostitute for such a violation if
6 the prosecuting attorney has reason to believe that the prostitute is a victim of sex
7 trafficking. (NRS 201.353)
8 Section 2 of this bill declares that it is the public policy of this State to
9 encourage the ability of victims of serious violent crimes to report such crimes and
10 to participate in the criminal justice system without fear of criminal prosecution for
11 engaging in prostitution or solicitation for prostitution. Section 3 of this bill
12 provides that a prostitute who engages in prostitution or solicitation for prostitution
13 is immune from criminal liability if the prostitute seeks emergency or medical
14 assistance and the evidence for the alleged violation was obtained as a result
15 thereof. Section 4 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law relating to
16 prostitution to sections 2 and 3.

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 201 of NRS is hereby amended by adding
2 thereto the provisions set forth as sections 2 and 3 of this act.
3 Sec. 2. The Legislature hereby declares that the public policy
4 of this State is to encourage victims of serious violent crimes to
5 report such crimes and to participate in the criminal justice
6 system. Those persons who are working in sex industries that are
7 criminalized by state law often do not report serious crimes
8 committed against themselves because of fear of arrest and
9 prosecution for sex work. Providing immunity from criminal
10 liability to prostitutes engaging in prostitution or solicitation for
11 prostitution ensures that victims of serious violent crimes that
12 occur during prostitution offenses may come forward to report the
13 perpetrators without fear of arrest and prosecution.
14 Sec. 3. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a
15 prostitute is immune from criminal liability for committing a
16 violation of NRS 201.353 or paragraph (b) of subsection 1 of NRS
17 207.030 if:
18 1. The prostitute seeks assistance from a 911 emergency
19 service or medical provider; and
20 2. The evidence for the alleged violation was obtained as a
21 result of:
22 (a) The prostitute seeking assistance;
23 (b) The immediate need for assistance; or
24 (c) The reporting of a need for assistance.
25 Sec. 4. NRS 201.295 is hereby amended to read as follows:
26 201.295 As used in NRS 201.295 to 201.440, inclusive, and
27 sections 2 and 3 of this act, unless the context otherwise requires:
28 1. “Adult” means a person 18 years of age or older.
29 2. “Child” means a person less than 18 years of age.
30 3. “Induce” means to persuade, encourage, inveigle or entice.
31 4. “Prostitute” means a male or female person who for a fee,
32 monetary consideration or other thing of value engages in sexual
33 intercourse, oral-genital contact or any touching of the sexual organs
34 or other intimate parts of a person for the purpose of arousing or
35 gratifying the sexual desire of either person.
36 5. “Prostitution” means engaging in sexual conduct with
37 another person in return for a fee, monetary consideration or other
38 thing of value.
