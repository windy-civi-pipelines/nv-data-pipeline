Section 1:
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to crimes; providing immunity from criminal
liability for engaging in prostitution or solicitation for
prostitution under certain circumstances; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law requires a peace officer who detains, arrests or issues a citation to
a prostitute for a violation of the prohibition against unlawfully engaging in
prostitution or solicitation for prostitution to provide information relating to certain
assistance for which the prostitute might be eligible. Existing law also requires a
prosecuting attorney to dismiss the charge against a prostitute for such a violation if
the prosecuting attorney has reason to believe that the prostitute is a victim of sex
trafficking. (NRS 201.353)

Section 2:
Section 2 of this bill declares that it is the public policy of this State to
encourage the ability of victims of serious violent crimes to report such crimes and
to participate in the criminal justice system without fear of criminal prosecution for
engaging in prostitution or solicitation for prostitution. Section 3 of this bill
provides that a prostitute who engages in prostitution or solicitation for prostitution
is immune from criminal liability if the prostitute seeks medical assistance from a
911 emergency service or medical provider and the evidence for the alleged
violation was obtained as a result thereof. Section 4 of this bill applies the
definitions in existing law relating to prostitution to sections 2 and 3.

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN

Section 3:
Section 1. Chapter 201 of NRS is hereby amended by adding
thereto the provisions set forth as sections 2 and 3 of this act.
Sec. 2. The Legislature hereby declares that the public policy
of this State is to encourage victims of serious violent crimes to
report such crimes and to participate in the criminal justice
system. Those persons who are working in sex industries that are
criminalized by state law often do not report serious crimes
committed against themselves because of fear of arrest and
prosecution for sex work. Providing immunity from criminal
liability to prostitutes engaging in prostitution or solicitation for
prostitution ensures that victims of serious violent crimes that
occur during prostitution offenses may come forward to report the
perpetrators without fear of arrest and prosecution.
Sec. 3. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a
prostitute is immune from criminal liability for committing a
