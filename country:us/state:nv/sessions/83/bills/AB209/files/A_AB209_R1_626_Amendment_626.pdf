EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to crimes; providing immunity from criminal liability for
engaging in prostitution or solicitation for prostitution under certain
circumstances; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires a peace officer who detains, arrests or issues a citation to a
2 prostitute for a violation of the prohibition against unlawfully engaging in prostitution or
3 solicitation for prostitution to provide information relating to certain assistance for which the
4 prostitute might be eligible. Existing law also requires a prosecuting attorney to dismiss the
5 charge against a prostitute for such a violation if the prosecuting attorney has reason to believe
6 that the prostitute is a victim of sex trafficking. (NRS 201.353)
7 Section 2 of this bill declares that it is the public policy of this State to encourage the
8 ability of victims of serious violent crimes to report such crimes and to participate in the
9 criminal justice system without fear of criminal prosecution for engaging in prostitution or
10 solicitation for prostitution. Section 3 of this bill provides that a prostitute who engages in
11 prostitution or solicitation for prostitution is immune from criminal liability if the prostitute
12 seeks [emergency or] medical assistance from a 911 emergency service or medical provider
13 and the evidence for the alleged violation was obtained as a result thereof. Section 4 of this
14 bill applies the definitions in existing law relating to prostitution to sections 2 and 3.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 201 of NRS is hereby amended by adding thereto the
2 provisions set forth as sections 2 and 3 of this act.
3 Sec. 2. The Legislature hereby declares that the public policy of this State
4 is to encourage victims of serious violent crimes to report such crimes and to
5 participate in the criminal justice system. Those persons who are working in sex
6 industries that are criminalized by state law often do not report serious crimes
7 committed against themselves because of fear of arrest and prosecution for sex
8 work. Providing immunity from criminal liability to prostitutes engaging in
9 prostitution or solicitation for prostitution ensures that victims of serious violent

1 crimes that occur during prostitution offenses may come forward to report the
2 perpetrators without fear of arrest and prosecution.
3 Sec. 3. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a prostitute is immune
4 from criminal liability for committing a violation of NRS 201.353 or paragraph
5 (b) of subsection 1 of NRS 207.030 if:
6 1. The prostitute seeks medical assistance from a 911 emergency service or
7 medical provider; and
8 2. The evidence for the alleged violation was obtained as a result of:
9 (a) The prostitute seeking medical assistance;
10 (b) The immediate need for medical assistance; or
11 (c) The reporting of a need for medical assistance.
12 Sec. 4. NRS 201.295 is hereby amended to read as follows:
13 201.295 As used in NRS 201.295 to 201.440, inclusive, and sections 2 and 3
