AN ACT relating to crimes; providing immunity from criminal liability for
engaging in prostitution or [committing certain acts while engaged in]
solicitation for prostitution under certain circumstances; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires a peace officer who detains, arrests or issues a citation to a
2 prostitute for a violation of the prohibition against unlawfully engaging in prostitution or
3 solicitation for prostitution to provide information relating to certain assistance for which the
4 prostitute might be eligible. Existing law also requires a prosecuting attorney to dismiss the
5 charge against a prostitute for such a violation if the prosecuting attorney has reason to believe
6 that the prostitute is a victim of sex trafficking. (NRS 201.353)
7 Section 2 of this bill declares that it is the public policy of this State to encourage the
8 ability of victims [and witnesses] of serious violent crimes to report such crimes and to
9 participate in the criminal justice system without fear of criminal prosecution for engaging in
10 prostitution or [committing certain acts while engaged in] solicitation for prostitution.
11 Section 3 of this bill provides that a [person] prostitute who [violates certain provisions of
12 existing law relating to] engages in prostitution [, controlled substances or certain acts relating
13 to vagrancy] or solicitation for prostitution is immune from criminal liability if [, during the
14 course of allegedly engaging in prostitution, the person: (1) is a victim or witness to certain
15 serious violent offenses; and (2)] the prostitute seeks [certain] emergency or medical
16 assistance [.] and the evidence for the alleged violation was obtained as a result thereof.
17 Section 4 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law relating to prostitution to sections
18 2 and 3.

2 working in sex industries that are criminalized by state law often do not report
3 serious crimes committed against themselves [, or committed against others in
