EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to crimes; providing immunity from criminal
liability for engaging in prostitution or committing certain
acts while engaged in prostitution under certain
circumstances; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires a peace officer who detains, arrests or issues a citation to
2 a prostitute for a violation of the prohibition against unlawfully engaging in
3 prostitution or solicitation for prostitution to provide information relating to certain
4 assistance for which the prostitute might be eligible. Existing law also requires a
5 prosecuting attorney to dismiss the charge against a prostitute for such a violation if
6 the prosecuting attorney has reason to believe that the prostitute is a victim of sex
7 trafficking. (NRS 201.353)
8 Section 2 of this bill declares that it is the public policy of this State to
9 encourage the ability of victims and witnesses of serious violent crimes to report
10 and participate in the criminal justice system without fear of criminal prosecution
11 for engaging in prostitution or committing certain acts while engaged in
12 prostitution. Section 3 of this bill provides that a person who violates certain
13 provisions of existing law relating to prostitution, controlled substances or certain
14 acts relating to vagrancy is immune from criminal liability if, during the course of
15 allegedly engaging in prostitution, the person: (1) is a victim or witness to certain
16 serious violent offenses; and (2) seeks certain assistance. Section 4 of this bill
17 applies the definitions in existing law relating to prostitution to sections 2 and 3.

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 201 of NRS is hereby amended by adding
2 thereto the provisions set forth as sections 2 and 3 of this act.
3 Sec. 2. The Legislature hereby declares that the public policy
4 of this State is to encourage victims and witnesses of serious
5 violent crimes to report such crimes and to participate in the
6 criminal justice system. Those persons who are working in sex
7 industries that are criminalized by state law often do not report
8 serious crimes committed against themselves, or committed
9 against others in their presence, because of fear of arrest and
10 prosecution for sex work and low-level drug crimes. Providing
11 immunity from criminal liability to persons engaging in
12 prostitution or committing certain acts while engaged in
13 prostitution ensures that victims and witnesses of serious violent
14 crimes that occur during prostitution offenses may come forward
15 to report the perpetrators without fear of arrest and prosecution.
16 Sec. 3. 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a
17 person described in subsection 2 is immune from criminal liability

20 relating to prostitution;

22 (1) Drug paraphernalia, including, without limitation, NRS
23 453.554 to 453.566, inclusive;
24 (2) Possession, unless it is for the purpose of sale or
25 violates the provisions of NRS 453.3385, subsection 2 of NRS

38 subsection 1 if the person commits any of the offenses described in
