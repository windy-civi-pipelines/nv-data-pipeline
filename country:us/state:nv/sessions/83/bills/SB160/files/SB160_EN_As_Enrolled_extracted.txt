Commission receives the complaint, unless it is impracticable to do so. (NRS

Raw Text:
Senate Bill No. 160–Senator Neal
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to discriminatory practices; moving the Nevada
Equal Rights Commission from the Department of
Employment, Training and Rehabilitation to the Office of the
Attorney General; revising certain duties of the Commission;
establishing certain requirements relating to attorneys and
paralegals who provide services to or are employed by the
Commission; setting forth certain requirements relating to the
final disposition of a complaint alleging an unlawful
discriminatory practice; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law creates the Nevada Equal Rights Commission within the
Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation. (Chapter 233 of NRS)
Sections 2-30 of this bill: (1) move the Commission from the Department to the
Office of the Attorney General; and (2) reorganize certain provisions relating to the
Commission. Section 46 of this bill repeals the provisions of existing law which
establish the Commission within the Department. Consistent with the repeal and
relocation of the Commission, sections 31-38 of this bill revise certain references to
provisions of existing law relating to the Commission.
Sections 41 and 42 of this bill: (1) require the Attorney General to appoint the
members of the Commission and the Administrator of the Commission as soon as
practicable after July 1, 2025; and (2) provide that the existing members and
Administrator, if qualified, may continue to serve until the Attorney General
appoints the new members and Administrator.
Existing law requires the Commission to carry out certain duties. (NRS
233.140) Section 12 requires the Commission to prepare and publish on the
Internet website of the Commission a summary of the process by which a person
may file an appeal with the United States Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission.
Under existing law, the Commission is authorized to investigate and conduct
hearings concerning acts of prejudice with regard to housing, employment and
public accommodations. (NRS 233.150) Section 15 requires: (1) an attorney who is
employed by, contracts with or provides volunteer services to the Commission to
review any complaint filed with the Commission alleging an unlawful
discriminatory practice and prepare all findings of fact and final disposition of the
complaint; (2) a paralegal who is employed by the Commission to annually
complete a minimum number of hours established by the Commission of
continuing education in certain areas relating to the work of the Commission; and
(3) the Commission to establish programs for law students to intern with the
Commission and attorneys to volunteer legal services to the Commission.
Under existing law, if the Commission conducts an investigation of a complaint
which alleges an unlawful discriminatory practice in housing, the Commission must
make a final disposition of the complaint within 1 year after the date the
Commission receives the complaint, unless it is impracticable to do so. (NRS
233.165) Sections 19 and 21 require that if the Commission conducts an
investigation of a complaint alleging an unlawful discriminatory practice in
housing, the Commission must make a final disposition of the complaint within 18
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 2 –
months after the date the complaint is received, unless the Commission determines
it is impracticable to do so. If the Commission determines it is impracticable,
section 21 requires the Commission to send to the complainant and the person
against whom the complaint was filed a statement informing the parties of its
reasons for not making a final disposition of the complaint within that period.
Section 21 also prohibits the Commission from closing a complaint without a
final disposition, unless the complainant has verbally or physically abused or
threatened a member of the Commission.
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.

Sec. 20. (Deleted by amendment.)
Sec. 21. 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2 or
3, if the Commission conducts an investigation of a complaint
which alleges an unlawful discriminatory practice in housing,
employment or public accommodation in accordance with the
regulations adopted pursuant to section 17 of this act, the
Commission must make a final disposition of the complaint within
18 months after the date the Commission receives the complaint
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 9 –
unless the Commission determines it is impracticable to do so
pursuant to subsection 2.
2. If the Commission determines that it is impracticable to
make a final disposition of a complaint which alleges an unlawful
discriminatory practice within the period prescribed by subsection
1, the Commission shall send to the complainant and the person
against whom the complaint was filed a statement setting forth its
reasons for not making a final disposition of the complaint within
that period.
3. The Commission may close an investigation of a complaint
without a final disposition if the Commission determines that the
complainant has verbally or physically abused or threatened a
member of the Commission. The Commission may not close an
investigation without a final disposition for any other reason.
Sec. 22. 1. When a complaint is filed whose allegations if
true would support a finding of unlawful practice, the Commission
shall determine whether to hold an informal meeting to attempt a
settlement of the dispute in accordance with the regulations
adopted pursuant to section 17 of this act. If the Commission
determines to hold an informal meeting, the Administrator may, to
prepare for the meeting, request from each party any information
which is reasonably relevant to the complaint. No further action
may be taken if the parties agree to a settlement.
2. If an agreement is not reached at the informal meeting
held pursuant to subsection 1, the Administrator shall determine
whether to conduct an investigation into the alleged unlawful
practice in accordance with the regulations adopted pursuant to
section 17 of this act. After the investigation, if the Administrator
determines that an unlawful practice has occurred, the
Administrator shall attempt to mediate between or reconcile the
parties. The party against whom a complaint was filed may agree
to cease the unlawful practice. If an agreement is reached, no
further action may be taken by the complainant or by the
Commission.
3. If the attempts at mediation or conciliation conducted
pursuant to subsection 2 fail, the Commission may hold a public
hearing on the matter. After the hearing, if the Commission
determines that an unlawful practice has occurred, the
Commission may:
(a) Serve a copy of the findings of fact of the Commission
within 10 calendar days upon any person found to have engaged
in the unlawful practice; and
(b) Order the person to:
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 10 –
(1) Cease and desist from the unlawful practice. The order
must include, without limitation, the corrective action the person
must take.
(2) In cases involving an unlawful employment practice,
restore all benefits and rights to which the aggrieved person is
entitled, including, without limitation, rehiring, back pay for a
period described in subsection 4, annual leave time, sick leave time
or pay, other fringe benefits and seniority, with interest thereon
from the date of the decision of the Commission at a rate equal to
the prime rate at the largest bank in Nevada, as ascertained by the
Commissioner of Financial Institutions, on January 1 or July 1,
as the case may be, immediately preceding the date of the decision,
plus 2 percent. The rate of interest must be adjusted accordingly
on each January 1 and July 1 thereafter until the judgment is
satisfied.
(3) In cases involving an unlawful employment practice
relating to discrimination on the basis of sex, pay an amount
determined to be appropriate by the Commission for lost wages
that would have been earned in the absence of discrimination or
other economic damages resulting from the discrimination,
including, without limitation, lost payment for overtime, shift
differential, cost of living adjustments, merit increases or
promotions, or other fringe benefits.
(4) In cases involving an unlawful employment practice
committed by an employer with 50 or more employees that the
Commission determines was willful, pay a civil penalty of:
(I) For the first unlawful employment practice that the
person has engaged in during the immediately preceding 5 years
which the Commission determines was willful, not more than
$5,000.
(II) For the second unlawful employment practice that
the person has engaged in during the immediately preceding 5
years which the Commission determines was willful, not more
than $10,000.
(III) For the third and any subsequent unlawful
employment practice that the person has engaged in during the
immediately preceding 5 years which the Commission determines
was willful, not more than $15,000.
4. For the purposes of subparagraph (2) of paragraph (b) of
subsection 3, the period for back pay must not exceed a period
beginning 2 years before the date on which the complaint was
filed and ending on the date the Commission issues an order
pursuant to paragraph (b) of subsection 3.
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 11 –
5. Before imposing a civil penalty pursuant to subparagraph
(4) of paragraph (b) of subsection 3, the Commission must allow
the person found to have willfully engaged in an unlawful
employment practice 30 days to take corrective action from the
date of service of the order made pursuant to paragraph (a) of
subsection 3. If the person takes such corrective action, the
Commission shall not impose the civil penalty.
6. The order of the Commission is a final decision in a
contested case for the purpose of judicial review. If the person
fails to comply with the order, the Commission shall apply to the
district court for an order compelling compliance, but failure or
delay on the part of the Commission does not prejudice the right of
an aggrieved party to judicial review. The court shall issue the
order unless it finds that the findings or order of the Commission
are not supported by substantial evidence or are otherwise
arbitrary or capricious. If the court upholds the order of the
Commission and finds that the person has violated the order by
failing to cease and desist from the unlawful practice or to make
the payment ordered, the court shall award the aggrieved party
actual damages for any economic loss and no more.
7. After the Commission has held a public hearing and
rendered a decision, the complainant is barred from proceeding on
the same facts and legal theory before any other administrative
body or officer.
8. For the purposes of this section, an unlawful employment
practice shall be deemed to be willful if a person engages in the
practice with knowledge that it is unlawful or with reckless
indifference to whether it is lawful or unlawful.
Sec. 23. 1. The Commission shall accept a complaint that
alleges that a local elected officer has engaged in an unlawful
employment practice of discrimination pursuant to Title VII of the
Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e et seq., or NRS
613.330 and take appropriate action.
2. The Commission shall present a complaint to the district
court pursuant to NRS 283.440 if the Commission determines
after a hearing held pursuant to subsection 3 of section 22 of this
act that a local elected officer has engaged in an unlawful
employment practice of discrimination pursuant to Title VII of the
Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e et seq., or NRS
613.330 and that the discriminatory practice that forms the basis
of such a complaint is severe or pervasive such that removal from
office is an appropriate remedy. In addition to any monetary
penalties, the Commission may impose upon the local elected
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 12 –
officer any other reasonable sanction, including, without
limitation, a requirement to complete a course or training related
to the unlawful employment practice of discrimination.
3. Any fine or penalty required to be paid by a local elected
officer because such officer was determined pursuant to
subsection 2 to have engaged in an unlawful employment practice
of discrimination must be assessed against such officer in his or
her personal capacity, and may not be paid with public money or
contributions received pursuant to chapter 294A of NRS. Except
for a fine or a penalty, no damages may be assessed against the
local elected officer in his or her personal capacity.
4. As used in this section, “local elected officer” means a
person who holds a local government office to which the person
was elected.
Sec. 24. If, after the Administrator has conducted a
preliminary investigation into an alleged unlawful discriminatory
practice in housing, employment or public accommodations, the
Commission determines that the practice will cause immediate and
irreparable harm to any person aggrieved by the practice, the
Commission, after the informal meeting and before holding a
public hearing upon the matter, may apply on behalf of such
person to the district court for a temporary restraining order or
preliminary injunction as provided in the Nevada Rules of Civil
Procedure.
Sec. 25. 1. Except as otherwise provided in this section or
NRS 239.0115, any information gathered by the Commission in

discriminatory practice in housing, employment or public
accommodations is confidential.

act; or

manner which does not include any information that may be used
to identify the complainant, the party against whom the unlawful
discriminatory practice is alleged or any person who provided
information to the Commission during the investigation.
3. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 4, the
Commission shall disclose information gathered pursuant to

subsection 1 to the complainant and the party against whom the
unlawful discriminatory practice is alleged if:

the Commission relating to the complaint. Such staff shall not
disclose such information to the other officers and employees of
the Office of the Attorney General, including, without limitation,
supervisors of the Office and the Attorney General, unless the
disclosure is necessary to carry out the duties of the Commission
relating to the complaint.
6. Except as otherwise provided in this section or NRS
239.0115, if the attempts of the Commission to mediate or
conciliate the cause of the grievance succeed, the information
gathered pursuant to subsection 1 must remain confidential.
7. If the Commission proceeds with a hearing or applies for
injunctive relief, confidentiality concerning any information,
except negotiations for a settlement or attempts at mediating or
conciliating the cause of the grievance, is no longer required.
Sec. 26. After the completion of any hearing, the
Commission shall report in writing to the Attorney General with
its findings of fact and recommendations or actions taken
pursuant to sections 2 to 30, inclusive, of this act. The Commission
shall use its best efforts to bring about compliance with its
recommendations.
Sec. 27. Notwithstanding any provision of sections 2 to 30,

-
83rd Session (2025)

– 26 –
Commission must allow the person found to have willfully
engaged in an unlawful employment practice 30 days to take
corrective action from the date of service of the order made
pursuant to paragraph (a) of subsection [3.] 4. If the person
takes such corrective action, the Commission shall not
impose the civil penalty.
[6.] 7. If the attempts at mediation or conciliation fail
in a case involving an unlawful housing practice:

contested case for the purpose of judicial review. If the
person fails to comply with the order, the Commission shall
apply to the district court for an order compelling compliance,
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 27 –
but failure or delay on the part of the Commission does not
prejudice the right of an aggrieved party to judicial review.
The court shall issue the order unless it finds that the findings
or order of the Commission are not supported by substantial
evidence or are otherwise arbitrary or capricious. If the court
upholds the order of the Commission and finds that the
person has violated the order by failing to cease and desist
from the unlawful practice or to make the payment ordered,
the court shall award the aggrieved party actual damages for
any economic loss and no more.

and rendered a decision, the complainant is barred from
proceeding on the same facts and legal theory before any
