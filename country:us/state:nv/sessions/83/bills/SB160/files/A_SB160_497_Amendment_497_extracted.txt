AN ACT relating to discriminatory practices; moving the Nevada Equal Rights
Commission from the Department of Employment, Training and
Rehabilitation to the Office of the Attorney General; revising certain
duties of the Commission; establishing certain requirements relating to
attorneys and paralegals who provide services to or are employed by
the Commission; [establishing certain requirements relating to a
complaint alleging an unlawful discriminatory practice in
employment;] setting forth certain requirements relating to the final
disposition of a complaint alleging an unlawful discriminatory
practice; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates the Nevada Equal Rights Commission within the Department of
2 Employment, Training and Rehabilitation. (Chapter 233 of NRS) Sections 2-30 of this bill:
3 (1) move the Commission from the Department to the Office of the Attorney General; and (2)
4 reorganize certain provisions relating to the Commission. Section 46 of this bill repeals the
5 provisions of existing law which establish the Commission within the Department. Consistent
6 with the repeal and relocation of the Commission, sections 31-38 of this bill revise certain
7 references to provisions of existing law relating to the Commission.
8 Sections 41 and 42 of this bill: (1) require the Attorney General to appoint the members
9 of the Commission and the Administrator of the Commission as soon as practicable after July
10 1, 2025; and (2) provide that the existing members and Administrator, if qualified, may
11 continue to serve until the Attorney General appoints the new members and Administrator.
12 Existing law requires the Commission to carry out certain duties. (NRS 233.140) Section
13 12 requires the Commission to prepare and publish on the Internet website of the Commission
14 a summary of the process by which a person may file an appeal with the United States Equal
15 Employment Opportunity Commission.
16 Under existing law, the Commission is authorized to investigate and conduct hearings
17 concerning acts of prejudice with regard to housing, employment and public accommodations.
18 (NRS 233.150) Section 15 requires: (1) an attorney who is employed by, contracts with or
19 provides volunteer services to the Commission to review any complaint filed with the
20 Commission alleging an unlawful discriminatory practice and prepare all findings of fact and
21 final disposition of the complaint; (2) a paralegal who is employed by the Commission to
22 annually complete a minimum number of hours established by the Commission of continuing
Senate Amendment No. 497 to Senate Bill No. 160 Page 4
23 education in certain areas relating to the work of the Commission; and (3) the Commission to
24 establish programs for law students to intern with the Commission and attorneys to volunteer
25 legal services to the Commission.
26 [Section 20 provides that if a complaint is filed with the Commission alleging an
27 unlawful discriminatory practice in employment: (1) by a governmental agency, the
28 Commission must consider the historical patterns and practices of the agency in determining
29 whether an investigation is warranted and any acts of nonfeasance and malfeasance with
30 regard to the complaint on behalf of the agency or a public officer or public employee of the
31 agency; and (2) by a private employer, the Commission must consider any historical data
32 available relating to the discriminatory practices on behalf of the private employer.]
33 Under existing law, if the Commission conducts an investigation of a complaint which
34 alleges an unlawful discriminatory practice in housing, the Commission must make a final
35 disposition of the complaint within 1 year after the date the Commission receives the
36 complaint, unless it is impracticable to do so. (NRS 233.165) Sections 19 and 21 require that
37 if the Commission conducts an investigation of a complaint alleging an unlawful
38 discriminatory practice in housing, the Commission must make a final disposition of the
39 complaint within 18 months after the date the complaint is received, unless the Commission
40 determines it is impracticable to do so. If the Commission determines it is impracticable,
41 section 21 requires the Commission to send to the complainant and the person against whom
42 the complaint was filed a statement informing the parties of its reasons for not making a final
43 disposition of the complaint within that period.
44 Section 21 also prohibits the Commission from closing a complaint without a final
45 disposition, unless the complainant has verbally or physically abused or threatened a member
46 of the Commission.

13 data available relating to the discriminatory practices of the private employer in

15 Sec. 21. 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2 or 3, if the

24 within the period prescribed by subsection 1, the Commission shall send to the

26 setting forth its reasons for not making a final disposition of the complaint within

29 final disposition if the Commission determines that the complainant has verbally
30 or physically abused or threatened a member of the Commission. The
31 Commission may not close an investigation without a final disposition for any
32 other reason.
33 Sec. 22. 1. When a complaint is filed whose allegations if true would
34 support a finding of unlawful practice, the Commission shall determine whether
35 to hold an informal meeting to attempt a settlement of the dispute in accordance
36 with the regulations adopted pursuant to section 17 of this act. If the Commission
37 determines to hold an informal meeting, the Administrator may, to prepare for

39 relevant to the complaint. No further action may be taken if the parties agree to a
40 settlement.
41 2. If an agreement is not reached at the informal meeting held pursuant to
42 subsection 1, the Administrator shall determine whether to conduct an
43 investigation into the alleged unlawful practice in accordance with the
44 regulations adopted pursuant to section 17 of this act. After the investigation, if
45 the Administrator determines that an unlawful practice has occurred, the
46 Administrator shall attempt to mediate between or reconcile the parties. The party
47 against whom a complaint was filed may agree to cease the unlawful practice. If
48 an agreement is reached, no further action may be taken by the complainant or
49 by the Commission.

53 occurred, the Commission may:
Senate Amendment No. 497 to Senate Bill No. 160 Page 10
1 (a) Serve a copy of the findings of fact of the Commission within 10 calendar
2 days upon any person found to have engaged in the unlawful practice; and
3 (b) Order the person to:
4 (1) Cease and desist from the unlawful practice. The order must include,
5 without limitation, the corrective action the person must take.
6 (2) In cases involving an unlawful employment practice, restore all
7 benefits and rights to which the aggrieved person is entitled, including, without
8 limitation, rehiring, back pay for a period described in subsection 4, annual leave
9 time, sick leave time or pay, other fringe benefits and seniority, with interest
10 thereon from the date of the decision of the Commission at a rate equal to the
11 prime rate at the largest bank in Nevada, as ascertained by the Commissioner of
12 Financial Institutions, on January 1 or July 1, as the case may be, immediately
13 preceding the date of the decision, plus 2 percent. The rate of interest must be
14 adjusted accordingly on each January 1 and July 1 thereafter until the judgment
15 is satisfied.
16 (3) In cases involving an unlawful employment practice relating to
17 discrimination on the basis of sex, pay an amount determined to be appropriate
18 by the Commission for lost wages that would have been earned in the absence of
19 discrimination or other economic damages resulting from the discrimination,
20 including, without limitation, lost payment for overtime, shift differential, cost of
21 living adjustments, merit increases or promotions, or other fringe benefits.
22 (4) In cases involving an unlawful employment practice committed by an
23 employer with 50 or more employees that the Commission determines was willful,
24 pay a civil penalty of:
25 (I) For the first unlawful employment practice that the person has
26 engaged in during the immediately preceding 5 years which the Commission
27 determines was willful, not more than $5,000.
28 (II) For the second unlawful employment practice that the person
29 has engaged in during the immediately preceding 5 years which the Commission
30 determines was willful, not more than $10,000.
31 (III) For the third and any subsequent unlawful employment practice
32 that the person has engaged in during the immediately preceding 5 years which
33 the Commission determines was willful, not more than $15,000.
34 4. For the purposes of subparagraph (2) of paragraph (b) of subsection 3,
35 the period for back pay must not exceed a period beginning 2 years before the
36 date on which the complaint was filed and ending on the date the Commission
37 issues an order pursuant to paragraph (b) of subsection 3.
38 5. Before imposing a civil penalty pursuant to subparagraph (4) of
39 paragraph (b) of subsection 3, the Commission must allow the person found to
40 have willfully engaged in an unlawful employment practice 30 days to take
41 corrective action from the date of service of the order made pursuant to
42 paragraph (a) of subsection 3. If the person takes such corrective action, the
43 Commission shall not impose the civil penalty.
44 6. The order of the Commission is a final decision in a contested case for
45 the purpose of judicial review. If the person fails to comply with the order, the
46 Commission shall apply to the district court for an order compelling compliance,
47 but failure or delay on the part of the Commission does not prejudice the right of
48 an aggrieved party to judicial review. The court shall issue the order unless it
49 finds that the findings or order of the Commission are not supported by
50 substantial evidence or are otherwise arbitrary or capricious. If the court upholds
51 the order of the Commission and finds that the person has violated the order by
52 failing to cease and desist from the unlawful practice or to make the payment
Senate Amendment No. 497 to Senate Bill No. 160 Page 11
1 ordered, the court shall award the aggrieved party actual damages for any
2 economic loss and no more.
3 7. After the Commission has held a public hearing and rendered a decision,
4 the complainant is barred from proceeding on the same facts and legal theory
5 before any other administrative body or officer.
6 8. For the purposes of this section, an unlawful employment practice shall
7 be deemed to be willful if a person engages in the practice with knowledge that it
8 is unlawful or with reckless indifference to whether it is lawful or unlawful.

11 records of a governmental entity must be open at all times during office hours to
12 inspection by any person, and may be fully copied or an abstract or memorandum
13 may be prepared from those public books and public records. Any such copies,

33 (a) The public record:
34 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
35 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
36 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by means of an
37 electronic medium would:
38 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
39 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential and that
40 cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from information that is not
41 otherwise confidential.
42 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who has legal
43 custody or control of a public record:

46 prefer to provide the copy in a different medium.
47 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon request, prepare
48 the copy of the public record and shall not require the person who has requested the

13 rendered or to be rendered in the officer’s office;
14 (b) Has refused or neglected to perform the official duties pertaining to the

17  the court shall cite the party charged to appear before it on a certain day, not
18 more than 10 days or less than 5 days from the day when the complaint was
19 presented. On that day, or some subsequent day not more than 20 days from that on
20 which the complaint was presented, the court, in a summary manner, shall proceed
21 to hear the complaint and evidence offered by the party complained of. If, on the
22 hearing, it appears that the charge or charges of the complaint are sustained, the
23 court shall enter a decree that the party complained of shall be deprived of the
24 party’s office.
25 3. The clerk of the court in which the proceedings are had, shall, within 3
26 days thereafter, transmit to the Governor or the board of county commissioners of
27 the proper county, as the case may be, a copy of any decree or judgment declaring
28 any officer deprived of any office under this section. The Governor or the board of
29 county commissioners, as the case may be, shall appoint some person to fill the
30 office until a successor shall be elected or appointed and qualified. The person so
31 appointed shall give such bond as security as is prescribed by law and pertaining to
32 the office.
33 4. If the judgment of the district court is against the officer complained of and
34 an appeal is taken from the judgment so rendered, the officer so appealing shall not
35 hold the office during the pendency of the appeal, but the office shall be filled as in
36 case of a vacancy.
37 5. As used in this section, “malfeasance in office” includes, without
38 limitation:

47 [Director of the Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation] Attorney

49 because revenue from billed services has not been collected or because of a delay in
50 the receipt of money from federal grants, he or she may request from the Director
51 of the Office of Finance a temporary advance from the State General Fund for the
52 payment of authorized expenses.

24 2019.
25 (b) If 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(e)(3)(A) is amended and the Commission

28 the date prescribed by 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(e)(3)(A), as amended.
29 Sec. 40. Section 22 of this act is hereby amended as follows:
30 Sec. 22. 1. When a complaint is filed whose allegations if true
31 would support a finding of unlawful practice, the Commission shall
32 determine whether to hold an informal meeting to attempt a settlement of
33 the dispute in accordance with the regulations adopted pursuant to section

Senate Amendment No. 497 to Senate Bill No. 160 Page 20
1 4. If the attempts at mediation or conciliation conducted pursuant to
2 subsection 2 fail [,] in a case involving an unlawful practice in

4 public hearing on the matter. After the hearing, if the Commission
5 determines that an unlawful practice has occurred, the Commission may:
6 (a) Serve a copy of the findings of fact of the Commission within 10
7 calendar days upon any person found to have engaged in the unlawful
8 practice; and

18 as ascertained by the Commissioner of Financial Institutions, on January 1
19 or July 1, as the case may be, immediately preceding the date of the
20 decision, plus 2 percent. The rate of interest must be adjusted accordingly
21 on each January 1 and July 1 thereafter until the judgment is satisfied.
22 (3) In cases involving an unlawful employment practice relating to

27 shift differential, cost of living adjustments, merit increases or promotions,
28 or other fringe benefits.
29 (4) In cases involving an unlawful employment practice committed
30 by an employer with 50 or more employees that the Commission
31 determines was willful, pay a civil penalty of:
32 (I) For the first unlawful employment practice that the person
33 has engaged in during the immediately preceding 5 years which the
34 Commission determines was willful, not more than $5,000.
35 (II) For the second unlawful employment practice that the
36 person has engaged in during the immediately preceding 5 years which the
37 Commission determines was willful, not more than $10,000.
38 (III) For the third and any subsequent unlawful employment
39 practice that the person has engaged in during the immediately preceding 5
40 years which the Commission determines was willful, not more than
41 $15,000.
42 [4.] 5. For the purposes of subparagraph (2) of paragraph (b) of

48 of paragraph (b) of subsection [3,] 4, the Commission must allow the
49 person found to have willfully engaged in an unlawful employment practice

52 corrective action, the Commission shall not impose the civil penalty.
Senate Amendment No. 497 to Senate Bill No. 160 Page 21
1 [6.] 7. If the attempts at mediation or conciliation fail in a case
2 involving an unlawful housing practice:
3 (a) The complainant or the person against whom the complaint was
4 filed may elect to have the claims included in the complaint decided in a
5 court of competent jurisdiction. If the court determines that the person
6 against whom the complaint was filed has committed an unlawful
7 housing practice, the court may:
8 (1) Award to the complainant actual damages and, within the
9 limitations prescribed by federal law, punitive damages;
10 (2) Award to the prevailing party costs and reasonable attorney’s
11 fees; and
12 (3) Order such other relief as the court deems appropriate,
13 including, without limitation:

16 (III) Enjoining the defendant from continuing the unlawful
17 practice or taking other affirmative action.
18 (b) If an election is not made pursuant to paragraph (a), the
19 Commission shall hold a public hearing on the matter. After the hearing,
20 if the Commission determines that an unlawful practice has occurred, the
21 Commission may:
22 (1) Serve a copy of the findings of fact within 10 days upon any
23 person found to have engaged in the unlawful practice;
24 (2) Order the person to cease and desist from the unlawful
25 practice;
26 (3) Award to the complainant actual damages; and
27 (4) Impose a civil penalty of not more than $25,000 upon the
28 person who committed the unlawful discriminatory practice.
29 8. The order of the Commission is a final decision in a contested case
30 for the purpose of judicial review. If the person fails to comply with the
31 order, the Commission shall apply to the district court for an order
32 compelling compliance, but failure or delay on the part of the Commission
33 does not prejudice the right of an aggrieved party to judicial review. The
34 court shall issue the order unless it finds that the findings or order of the
35 Commission are not supported by substantial evidence or are otherwise
36 arbitrary or capricious. If the court upholds the order of the Commission
37 and finds that the person has violated the order by failing to cease and
38 desist from the unlawful practice or to make the payment ordered, the court
39 shall award the aggrieved party actual damages for any economic loss and
40 no more.
41 [7.] 9. After the Commission has held a public hearing and rendered
42 a decision, the complainant is barred from proceeding on the same facts and
43 legal theory before any other administrative body or officer.
44 [8.] 10. For the purposes of this section, an unlawful employment
45 practice shall be deemed to be willful if a person engages in the practice
46 with knowledge that it is unlawful or with reckless indifference to whether
47 it is lawful or unlawful.
48 Sec. 41. 1. As soon as practicable after July 1, 2025, the Attorney General
49 shall appoint to the Nevada Equal Rights Commission the members required by

52 created by NRS 233.030, as that section existed on June 30, 2025, continue to serve

9 successor is appointed by the Attorney General pursuant to section 10 of this act.
10 Sec. 43. 1. Any administrative regulations adopted by an officer or an
11 agency whose name has been changed or whose responsibilities have been
12 transferred pursuant to the provisions of this act to another officer or agency remain

14 adoption of the regulations has been transferred.
15 2. Any contracts or other agreements entered into by an officer or agency
16 whose name has been changed or whose responsibilities have been transferred
17 pursuant to the provisions of this act to another officer or agency are binding upon
18 the officer or agency to which the responsibility for the administration of the
19 provisions of the contract or other agreement has been transferred. Such contracts
20 and other agreements may be enforced by the officer or agency to which the
21 responsibility for the enforcement of the provisions of the contract or other
22 agreement has been transferred.
23 3. Any action taken by an officer or agency whose name has been changed or
24 whose responsibilities have been transferred pursuant to the provisions of this act to
25 another officer or agency remains in effect as if taken by the officer or agency to
26 which the responsibility for the enforcement of such actions has been transferred.
27 Sec. 44. The provisions of subsection 1 of NRS 218D.380 do not apply to
28 any provision of this act which adds or revises a requirement to submit a report to
29 the Legislature.
30 Sec. 45. The Legislative Counsel shall, in preparing supplements to the
31 Nevada Administrative Code, appropriately change any references to an officer,
32 agency or other entity whose name is changed or whose responsibilities are
33 transferred pursuant to the provisions of this act to refer to the appropriate officer,
34 agency or other entity.

SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to the Nevada Equal Rights
Commission. (BDR 18-82)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to discriminatory practices; moving the Nevada Equal Rights
Commission from the Department of Employment, Training and
Rehabilitation to the Office of the Attorney General; revising certain
duties of the Commission; establishing certain requirements relating to
attorneys and paralegals who provide services to or are employed by
the Commission; [establishing certain requirements relating to a
complaint alleging an unlawful discriminatory practice in
employment;] setting forth certain requirements relating to the final
disposition of a complaint alleging an unlawful discriminatory
practice; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates the Nevada Equal Rights Commission within the Department of
2 Employment, Training and Rehabilitation. (Chapter 233 of NRS) Sections 2-30 of this bill:
3 (1) move the Commission from the Department to the Office of the Attorney General; and (2)
4 reorganize certain provisions relating to the Commission. Section 46 of this bill repeals the
5 provisions of existing law which establish the Commission within the Department. Consistent
6 with the repeal and relocation of the Commission, sections 31-38 of this bill revise certain
7 references to provisions of existing law relating to the Commission.
8 Sections 41 and 42 of this bill: (1) require the Attorney General to appoint the members
9 of the Commission and the Administrator of the Commission as soon as practicable after July
10 1, 2025; and (2) provide that the existing members and Administrator, if qualified, may
11 continue to serve until the Attorney General appoints the new members and Administrator.
12 Existing law requires the Commission to carry out certain duties. (NRS 233.140) Section
13 12 requires the Commission to prepare and publish on the Internet website of the Commission
14 a summary of the process by which a person may file an appeal with the United States Equal
15 Employment Opportunity Commission.
16 Under existing law, the Commission is authorized to investigate and conduct hearings
17 concerning acts of prejudice with regard to housing, employment and public accommodations.
18 (NRS 233.150) Section 15 requires: (1) an attorney who is employed by, contracts with or
19 provides volunteer services to the Commission to review any complaint filed with the
20 Commission alleging an unlawful discriminatory practice and prepare all findings of fact and
21 final disposition of the complaint; (2) a paralegal who is employed by the Commission to
22 annually complete a minimum number of hours established by the Commission of continuing

Senate Amendment No. 497 to Senate Bill No. 160 Page 4
23 education in certain areas relating to the work of the Commission; and (3) the Commission to
24 establish programs for law students to intern with the Commission and attorneys to volunteer
25 legal services to the Commission.
26 [Section 20 provides that if a complaint is filed with the Commission alleging an
27 unlawful discriminatory practice in employment: (1) by a governmental agency, the
28 Commission must consider the historical patterns and practices of the agency in determining
29 whether an investigation is warranted and any acts of nonfeasance and malfeasance with
30 regard to the complaint on behalf of the agency or a public officer or public employee of the
31 agency; and (2) by a private employer, the Commission must consider any historical data
32 available relating to the discriminatory practices on behalf of the private employer.]
33 Under existing law, if the Commission conducts an investigation of a complaint which
34 alleges an unlawful discriminatory practice in housing, the Commission must make a final
35 disposition of the complaint within 1 year after the date the Commission receives the
36 complaint, unless it is impracticable to do so. (NRS 233.165) Sections 19 and 21 require that
37 if the Commission conducts an investigation of a complaint alleging an unlawful
38 discriminatory practice in housing, the Commission must make a final disposition of the
39 complaint within 18 months after the date the complaint is received, unless the Commission
40 determines it is impracticable to do so. If the Commission determines it is impracticable,
41 section 21 requires the Commission to send to the complainant and the person against whom
42 the complaint was filed a statement informing the parties of its reasons for not making a final
43 disposition of the complaint within that period.
44 Section 21 also prohibits the Commission from closing a complaint without a final
45 disposition, unless the complainant has verbally or physically abused or threatened a member
46 of the Commission.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

3 (b) Order the person to:
4 (1) Cease and desist from the unlawful practice. The order must include,
5 without limitation, the corrective action the person must take.
6 (2) In cases involving an unlawful employment practice, restore all
7 benefits and rights to which the aggrieved person is entitled, including, without
8 limitation, rehiring, back pay for a period described in subsection 4, annual leave
9 time, sick leave time or pay, other fringe benefits and seniority, with interest
10 thereon from the date of the decision of the Commission at a rate equal to the

12 Financial Institutions, on January 1 or July 1, as the case may be, immediately

26 engaged in during the immediately preceding 5 years which the Commission

32 that the person has engaged in during the immediately preceding 5 years which
33 the Commission determines was willful, not more than $15,000.
34 4. For the purposes of subparagraph (2) of paragraph (b) of subsection 3,

39 paragraph (b) of subsection 3, the Commission must allow the person found to
40 have willfully engaged in an unlawful employment practice 30 days to take
41 corrective action from the date of service of the order made pursuant to
42 paragraph (a) of subsection 3. If the person takes such corrective action, the
43 Commission shall not impose the civil penalty.
44 6. The order of the Commission is a final decision in a contested case for
45 the purpose of judicial review. If the person fails to comply with the order, the
46 Commission shall apply to the district court for an order compelling compliance,
47 but failure or delay on the part of the Commission does not prejudice the right of
48 an aggrieved party to judicial review. The court shall issue the order unless it
49 finds that the findings or order of the Commission are not supported by
50 substantial evidence or are otherwise arbitrary or capricious. If the court upholds
51 the order of the Commission and finds that the person has violated the order by
52 failing to cease and desist from the unlawful practice or to make the payment

1 ordered, the court shall award the aggrieved party actual damages for any

12 2000e et seq., or NRS 613.330 and take appropriate action.

16 unlawful employment practice of discrimination pursuant to Title VII of the Civil
17 Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e et seq., or NRS 613.330 and that the

21 officer any other reasonable sanction, including, without limitation, a
22 requirement to complete a course or training related to the unlawful employment
23 practice of discrimination.

9 Statutes of Nevada 2011 and section 2 of chapter 391, Statutes of Nevada 2013 and
10 unless otherwise declared by law to be confidential, all public books and public
11 records of a governmental entity must be open at all times during office hours to
12 inspection by any person, and may be fully copied or an abstract or memorandum
13 may be prepared from those public books and public records. Any such copies,

20 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record which is

32 electronic format or by means of an electronic medium if:
33 (a) The public record:
34 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
35 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
36 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by means of an
37 electronic medium would:
38 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
39 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential and that
40 cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from information that is not
41 otherwise confidential.
42 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who has legal
43 custody or control of a public record:
44 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the medium that

5 subsection within 10 days after the Commission receives the complaint.
6 [4.] 5. A person against whom an unlawful discriminatory practice

23 by 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(e)(3)(A), as that section existed on January 1,
24 2019.
25 (b) If 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(e)(3)(A) is amended and the Commission
26 determines by regulation that the section, as amended, provides greater
27 protection for employees than that section as it existed on January 1, 2019,
28 the date prescribed by 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(e)(3)(A), as amended.
29 Sec. 40. Section 22 of this act is hereby amended as follows:
30 Sec. 22. 1. When a complaint is filed whose allegations if true
31 would support a finding of unlawful practice, the Commission shall
32 determine whether to hold an informal meeting to attempt a settlement of
33 the dispute in accordance with the regulations adopted pursuant to section
34 17 of this act. If the Commission determines to hold an informal meeting,

52 otherwise agree and the Commission determines that disclosure is not
53 necessary to further the purposes of chapter 118 of NRS.

Senate Amendment No. 497 to Senate Bill No. 160 Page 20
1 4. If the attempts at mediation or conciliation conducted pursuant to
2 subsection 2 fail [,] in a case involving an unlawful practice in
3 employment or public accommodations, the Commission may hold a
4 public hearing on the matter. After the hearing, if the Commission
5 determines that an unlawful practice has occurred, the Commission may:
6 (a) Serve a copy of the findings of fact of the Commission within 10
7 calendar days upon any person found to have engaged in the unlawful
8 practice; and
9 (b) Order the person to:
10 (1) Cease and desist from the unlawful practice. The order must
11 include, without limitation, the corrective action the person must take.
12 (2) In cases involving an unlawful employment practice, restore all
13 benefits and rights to which the aggrieved person is entitled, including,
14 without limitation, rehiring, back pay for a period described in subsection

16 seniority, with interest thereon from the date of the decision of the
17 Commission at a rate equal to the prime rate at the largest bank in Nevada,
18 as ascertained by the Commissioner of Financial Institutions, on January 1
19 or July 1, as the case may be, immediately preceding the date of the
20 decision, plus 2 percent. The rate of interest must be adjusted accordingly
21 on each January 1 and July 1 thereafter until the judgment is satisfied.
22 (3) In cases involving an unlawful employment practice relating to
23 discrimination on the basis of sex, pay an amount determined to be

25 in the absence of discrimination or other economic damages resulting from
26 the discrimination, including, without limitation, lost payment for overtime,
27 shift differential, cost of living adjustments, merit increases or promotions,
28 or other fringe benefits.
29 (4) In cases involving an unlawful employment practice committed
30 by an employer with 50 or more employees that the Commission
31 determines was willful, pay a civil penalty of:
32 (I) For the first unlawful employment practice that the person
33 has engaged in during the immediately preceding 5 years which the
34 Commission determines was willful, not more than $5,000.
35 (II) For the second unlawful employment practice that the
36 person has engaged in during the immediately preceding 5 years which the
37 Commission determines was willful, not more than $10,000.
38 (III) For the third and any subsequent unlawful employment
39 practice that the person has engaged in during the immediately preceding 5
40 years which the Commission determines was willful, not more than
41 $15,000.
42 [4.] 5. For the purposes of subparagraph (2) of paragraph (b) of

47 [5.] 6. Before imposing a civil penalty pursuant to subparagraph (4)
48 of paragraph (b) of subsection [3,] 4, the Commission must allow the
49 person found to have willfully engaged in an unlawful employment practice
50 30 days to take corrective action from the date of service of the order made

52 corrective action, the Commission shall not impose the civil penalty.

Senate Amendment No. 497 to Senate Bill No. 160 Page 21
1 [6.] 7. If the attempts at mediation or conciliation fail in a case
2 involving an unlawful housing practice:
3 (a) The complainant or the person against whom the complaint was
4 filed may elect to have the claims included in the complaint decided in a
5 court of competent jurisdiction. If the court determines that the person
6 against whom the complaint was filed has committed an unlawful
7 housing practice, the court may:
8 (1) Award to the complainant actual damages and, within the
9 limitations prescribed by federal law, punitive damages;
10 (2) Award to the prevailing party costs and reasonable attorney’s
11 fees; and
12 (3) Order such other relief as the court deems appropriate,
13 including, without limitation:

16 (III) Enjoining the defendant from continuing the unlawful
17 practice or taking other affirmative action.
18 (b) If an election is not made pursuant to paragraph (a), the
19 Commission shall hold a public hearing on the matter. After the hearing,
20 if the Commission determines that an unlawful practice has occurred, the
21 Commission may:
22 (1) Serve a copy of the findings of fact within 10 days upon any
23 person found to have engaged in the unlawful practice;
24 (2) Order the person to cease and desist from the unlawful
25 practice;
26 (3) Award to the complainant actual damages; and
27 (4) Impose a civil penalty of not more than $25,000 upon the
28 person who committed the unlawful discriminatory practice.
29 8. The order of the Commission is a final decision in a contested case
30 for the purpose of judicial review. If the person fails to comply with the
31 order, the Commission shall apply to the district court for an order
32 compelling compliance, but failure or delay on the part of the Commission
33 does not prejudice the right of an aggrieved party to judicial review. The
34 court shall issue the order unless it finds that the findings or order of the
35 Commission are not supported by substantial evidence or are otherwise
36 arbitrary or capricious. If the court upholds the order of the Commission
37 and finds that the person has violated the order by failing to cease and
38 desist from the unlawful practice or to make the payment ordered, the court
39 shall award the aggrieved party actual damages for any economic loss and
40 no more.
41 [7.] 9. After the Commission has held a public hearing and rendered
42 a decision, the complainant is barred from proceeding on the same facts and
43 legal theory before any other administrative body or officer.
44 [8.] 10. For the purposes of this section, an unlawful employment
45 practice shall be deemed to be willful if a person engages in the practice
46 with knowledge that it is unlawful or with reckless indifference to whether
47 it is lawful or unlawful.
48 Sec. 41. 1. As soon as practicable after July 1, 2025, the Attorney General
49 shall appoint to the Nevada Equal Rights Commission the members required by
50 section 8 of this act to be appointed to the Commission.

52 created by NRS 233.030, as that section existed on June 30, 2025, continue to serve

1 as members until the Attorney General appoints members to the Commission
2 pursuant to section 8 of this act.
3 Sec. 42. 1. As soon as practicable after July 1, 2025, the Attorney General
4 shall appoint to the Nevada Equal Rights Commission the Administrator of the

8 Administrator on that date may continue to serve in that capacity until his or her
9 successor is appointed by the Attorney General pursuant to section 10 of this act.
10 Sec. 43. 1. Any administrative regulations adopted by an officer or an
11 agency whose name has been changed or whose responsibilities have been
12 transferred pursuant to the provisions of this act to another officer or agency remain
13 in force until amended by the officer or agency to which the responsibility for the
14 adoption of the regulations has been transferred.
15 2. Any contracts or other agreements entered into by an officer or agency
16 whose name has been changed or whose responsibilities have been transferred
17 pursuant to the provisions of this act to another officer or agency are binding upon
18 the officer or agency to which the responsibility for the administration of the
19 provisions of the contract or other agreement has been transferred. Such contracts
20 and other agreements may be enforced by the officer or agency to which the
21 responsibility for the enforcement of the provisions of the contract or other
22 agreement has been transferred.
23 3. Any action taken by an officer or agency whose name has been changed or
24 whose responsibilities have been transferred pursuant to the provisions of this act to
25 another officer or agency remains in effect as if taken by the officer or agency to
26 which the responsibility for the enforcement of such actions has been transferred.
27 Sec. 44. The provisions of subsection 1 of NRS 218D.380 do not apply to
28 any provision of this act which adds or revises a requirement to submit a report to
29 the Legislature.
30 Sec. 45. The Legislative Counsel shall, in preparing supplements to the
31 Nevada Administrative Code, appropriately change any references to an officer,
32 agency or other entity whose name is changed or whose responsibilities are
33 transferred pursuant to the provisions of this act to refer to the appropriate officer,
34 agency or other entity.
