Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates the Nevada Equal Rights Commission within the
2 Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation. (Chapter 233 of NRS)
3 Sections 2-30 of this bill: (1) move the Commission from the Department to the
4 Office of the Attorney General; and (2) reorganize certain provisions relating to the
5 Commission. Section 46 of this bill repeals the provisions of existing law which
6 establish the Commission within the Department. Consistent with the repeal and
7 relocation of the Commission, sections 31-38 of this bill revise certain references to
8 provisions of existing law relating to the Commission.
9 Sections 41 and 42 of this bill: (1) require the Attorney General to appoint the
10 members of the Commission and the Administrator of the Commission as soon as
11 practicable after July 1, 2025; and (2) provide that the existing members and
12 Administrator, if qualified, may continue to serve until the Attorney General
13 appoints the new members and Administrator.
14 Existing law requires the Commission to carry out certain duties. (NRS
15 233.140) Section 12 requires the Commission to prepare and publish on the
16 Internet website of the Commission a summary of the process by which a person
17 may file an appeal with the United States Equal Employment Opportunity
18 Commission.

19 Under existing law, the Commission is authorized to investigate and conduct
20 hearings concerning acts of prejudice with regard to housing, employment and
21 public accommodations. (NRS 233.150) Section 15 requires: (1) an attorney who is
22 employed by, contracts with or provides volunteer services to the Commission to
23 review any complaint filed with the Commission alleging an unlawful
24 discriminatory practice and prepare all findings of fact and final disposition of the
25 complaint; (2) a paralegal who is employed by the Commission to annually
26 complete a minimum number of hours established by the Commission of
27 continuing education in certain areas relating to the work of the Commission; and
28 (3) the Commission to establish programs for law students to intern with the
29 Commission and attorneys to volunteer legal services to the Commission.
30 Under existing law, if the Commission conducts an investigation of a complaint
31 which alleges an unlawful discriminatory practice in housing, the Commission must
32 make a final disposition of the complaint within 1 year after the date the
33 Commission receives the complaint, unless it is impracticable to do so. (NRS
34 233.165) Sections 19 and 21 require that if the Commission conducts an
35 investigation of a complaint alleging an unlawful discriminatory practice in
36 housing, the Commission must make a final disposition of the complaint within 18
37 months after the date the complaint is received, unless the Commission determines
38 it is impracticable to do so. If the Commission determines it is impracticable,
39 section 21 requires the Commission to send to the complainant and the person
40 against whom the complaint was filed a statement informing the parties of its
41 reasons for not making a final disposition of the complaint within that period.
42 Section 21 also prohibits the Commission from closing a complaint without a
43 final disposition, unless the complainant has verbally or physically abused or
44 threatened a member of the Commission.

5 or pay, other fringe benefits and seniority, with interest thereon
6 from the date of the decision of the Commission at a rate equal to
7 the prime rate at the largest bank in Nevada, as ascertained by the
8 Commissioner of Financial Institutions, on January 1 or July 1,
9 as the case may be, immediately preceding the date of the decision,

11 on each January 1 and July 1 thereafter until the judgment is
12 satisfied.
13 (3) In cases involving an unlawful employment practice
14 relating to discrimination on the basis of sex, pay an amount
15 determined to be appropriate by the Commission for lost wages
16 that would have been earned in the absence of discrimination or

19 differential, cost of living adjustments, merit increases or
20 promotions, or other fringe benefits.
21 (4) In cases involving an unlawful employment practice
22 committed by an employer with 50 or more employees that the
23 Commission determines was willful, pay a civil penalty of:
24 (I) For the first unlawful employment practice that the
25 person has engaged in during the immediately preceding 5 years
26 which the Commission determines was willful, not more than
27 $5,000.
28 (II) For the second unlawful employment practice that
29 the person has engaged in during the immediately preceding 5
30 years which the Commission determines was willful, not more
31 than $10,000.
32 (III) For the third and any subsequent unlawful
33 employment practice that the person has engaged in during the

-
*SB160_R1*

– 11 –
1 subsection 3. If the person takes such corrective action, the
2 Commission shall not impose the civil penalty.
3 6. The order of the Commission is a final decision in a
4 contested case for the purpose of judicial review. If the person
5 fails to comply with the order, the Commission shall apply to the
6 district court for an order compelling compliance, but failure or
7 delay on the part of the Commission does not prejudice the right of
8 an aggrieved party to judicial review. The court shall issue the
9 order unless it finds that the findings or order of the Commission
10 are not supported by substantial evidence or are otherwise
11 arbitrary or capricious. If the court upholds the order of the
12 Commission and finds that the person has violated the order by
13 failing to cease and desist from the unlawful practice or to make
14 the payment ordered, the court shall award the aggrieved party
15 actual damages for any economic loss and no more.
16 7. After the Commission has held a public hearing and
17 rendered a decision, the complainant is barred from proceeding on
18 the same facts and legal theory before any other administrative
19 body or officer.
20 8. For the purposes of this section, an unlawful employment
21 practice shall be deemed to be willful if a person engages in the
22 practice with knowledge that it is unlawful or with reckless
23 indifference to whether it is lawful or unlawful.
24 Sec. 23. 1. The Commission shall accept a complaint that
25 alleges that a local elected officer has engaged in an unlawful
26 employment practice of discrimination pursuant to Title VII of the
27 Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e et seq., or NRS
28 613.330 and take appropriate action.
29 2. The Commission shall present a complaint to the district
30 court pursuant to NRS 283.440 if the Commission determines
31 after a hearing held pursuant to subsection 3 of section 22 of this
32 act that a local elected officer has engaged in an unlawful
33 employment practice of discrimination pursuant to Title VII of the
34 Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e et seq., or NRS
35 613.330 and that the discriminatory practice that forms the basis
36 of such a complaint is severe or pervasive such that removal from
37 office is an appropriate remedy. In addition to any monetary
38 penalties, the Commission may impose upon the local elected
39 officer any other reasonable sanction, including, without
40 limitation, a requirement to complete a course or training related
41 to the unlawful employment practice of discrimination.
42 3. Any fine or penalty required to be paid by a local elected
43 officer because such officer was determined pursuant to

6 person fails to comply with the order, the Commission shall
7 apply to the district court for an order compelling compliance,

9 prejudice the right of an aggrieved party to judicial review.
10 The court shall issue the order unless it finds that the findings
11 or order of the Commission are not supported by substantial
12 evidence or are otherwise arbitrary or capricious. If the court
13 upholds the order of the Commission and finds that the
