AN ACT relating to discriminatory practices; moving the Nevada
Equal Rights Commission from the Department of
Employment, Training and Rehabilitation to the Office of
the Attorney General; revising certain duties of the
Commission; establishing certain requirements relating to
attorneys and paralegals who provide services to or are

and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates the Nevada Equal Rights Commission within the
2 Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation. (Chapter 233 of NRS)
3 Sections 2-30 of this bill: (1) move the Commission from the Department to the
4 Office of the Attorney General; and (2) reorganize certain provisions relating to the
5 Commission. Section 46 of this bill repeals the provisions of existing law which
6 establish the Commission within the Department. Consistent with the repeal and
7 relocation of the Commission, sections 31-38 of this bill revise certain references to
8 provisions of existing law relating to the Commission.
9 Sections 41 and 42 of this bill: (1) require the Attorney General to appoint the
10 members of the Commission and the Administrator of the Commission as soon as
11 practicable after July 1, 2025; and (2) provide that the existing members and
12 Administrator, if qualified, may continue to serve until the Attorney General
13 appoints the new members and Administrator.
14 Existing law requires the Commission to carry out certain duties. (NRS
15 233.140) Section 12 requires the Commission to prepare and publish on the
16 Internet website of the Commission a summary of the process by which a person
-

– 2 –
17 may file an appeal with the United States Equal Employment Opportunity
18 Commission.
19 Under existing law, the Commission is authorized to investigate and conduct
20 hearings concerning acts of prejudice with regard to housing, employment and
21 public accommodations. (NRS 233.150) Section 15 requires: (1) an attorney who is
22 employed by, contracts with or provides volunteer services to the Commission to
23 review any complaint filed with the Commission alleging an unlawful
24 discriminatory practice and prepare all findings of fact and final disposition of the
25 complaint; (2) a paralegal who is employed by the Commission to annually
26 complete a minimum number of hours established by the Commission of
27 continuing education in certain areas relating to the work of the Commission; and
28 (3) the Commission to establish programs for law students to intern with the
29 Commission and attorneys to volunteer legal services to the Commission.
30 Section 20 provides that if a complaint is filed with the Commission alleging
31 an unlawful discriminatory practice in employment: (1) by a governmental agency,
32 the Commission must consider the historical patterns and practices of the agency in
33 determining whether an investigation is warranted and any acts of nonfeasance and
34 malfeasance with regard to the complaint on behalf of the agency or a public officer
35 or public employee of the agency; and (2) by a private employer, the Commission
36 must consider any historical data available relating to the discriminatory practices
37 on behalf of the private employer.
38 Under existing law, if the Commission conducts an investigation of a complaint
39 which alleges an unlawful discriminatory practice in housing, the Commission must
40 make a final disposition of the complaint within 1 year after the date the
41 Commission receives the complaint, unless it is impracticable to do so. (NRS
42 233.165) Sections 19 and 21 require that if the Commission conducts an
43 investigation of a complaint alleging an unlawful discriminatory practice in
44 housing, the Commission must make a final disposition of the complaint within 18
45 months after the date the complaint is received, unless the Commission determines
46 it is impracticable to do so. If the Commission determines it is impracticable,
47 section 21 requires the Commission to send to the complainant and the person
48 against whom the complaint was filed a statement informing the parties of its
49 reasons for not making a final disposition of the complaint within that period.
50 Section 21 also prohibits the Commission from closing a complaint without a
51 final disposition, unless the complainant has verbally or physically abused or
52 threatened a member of the Commission.

1 (4) In cases involving an unlawful employment practice
2 committed by an employer with 50 or more employees that the
3 Commission determines was willful, pay a civil penalty of:
4 (I) For the first unlawful employment practice that the
5 person has engaged in during the immediately preceding 5 years
6 which the Commission determines was willful, not more than
7 $5,000.
8 (II) For the second unlawful employment practice that
9 the person has engaged in during the immediately preceding 5
10 years which the Commission determines was willful, not more
11 than $10,000.
12 (III) For the third and any subsequent unlawful
13 employment practice that the person has engaged in during the
14 immediately preceding 5 years which the Commission determines
15 was willful, not more than $15,000.
16 4. For the purposes of subparagraph (2) of paragraph (b) of
17 subsection 3, the period for back pay must not exceed a period
18 beginning 2 years before the date on which the complaint was
19 filed and ending on the date the Commission issues an order
20 pursuant to paragraph (b) of subsection 3.
21 5. Before imposing a civil penalty pursuant to subparagraph
22 (4) of paragraph (b) of subsection 3, the Commission must allow
23 the person found to have willfully engaged in an unlawful
24 employment practice 30 days to take corrective action from the
25 date of service of the order made pursuant to paragraph (a) of
26 subsection 3. If the person takes such corrective action, the
27 Commission shall not impose the civil penalty.
28 6. The order of the Commission is a final decision in a
29 contested case for the purpose of judicial review. If the person
30 fails to comply with the order, the Commission shall apply to the
31 district court for an order compelling compliance, but failure or
32 delay on the part of the Commission does not prejudice the right of
33 an aggrieved party to judicial review. The court shall issue the
34 order unless it finds that the findings or order of the Commission
35 are not supported by substantial evidence or are otherwise
36 arbitrary or capricious. If the court upholds the order of the
37 Commission and finds that the person has violated the order by
38 failing to cease and desist from the unlawful practice or to make
39 the payment ordered, the court shall award the aggrieved party
40 actual damages for any economic loss and no more.
41 7. After the Commission has held a public hearing and
42 rendered a decision, the complainant is barred from proceeding on
43 the same facts and legal theory before any other administrative
44 body or officer.
-
*SB160*

– 12 –
1 8. For the purposes of this section, an unlawful employment
2 practice shall be deemed to be willful if a person engages in the
3 practice with knowledge that it is unlawful or with reckless
4 indifference to whether it is lawful or unlawful.
5 Sec. 23. 1. The Commission shall accept a complaint that
6 alleges that a local elected officer has engaged in an unlawful
7 employment practice of discrimination pursuant to Title VII of the

5 chapter 478, Statutes of Nevada 2011 and section 2 of chapter 391,

7 confidential, all public books and public records of a governmental
8 entity must be open at all times during office hours to inspection by
9 any person, and may be fully copied or an abstract or memorandum
10 may be prepared from those public books and public records. Any

34 (a) The public record:
35 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
36 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
37 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by
38 means of an electronic medium would:

40 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential
41 and that cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from
42 information that is not otherwise confidential.
43 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who
44 has legal custody or control of a public record:

33 day not more than 20 days from that on which the complaint was
34 presented, the court, in a summary manner, shall proceed to hear the
35 complaint and evidence offered by the party complained of. If, on
36 the hearing, it appears that the charge or charges of the complaint
37 are sustained, the court shall enter a decree that the party
38 complained of shall be deprived of the party’s office.
39 3. The clerk of the court in which the proceedings are had,
40 shall, within 3 days thereafter, transmit to the Governor or the board
41 of county commissioners of the proper county, as the case may be, a
42 copy of any decree or judgment declaring any officer deprived of
43 any office under this section. The Governor or the board of county
44 commissioners, as the case may be, shall appoint some person to fill
45 the office until a successor shall be elected or appointed and
-
*SB160*

– 21 –
1 qualified. The person so appointed shall give such bond as security

3 4. If the judgment of the district court is against the officer
4 complained of and an appeal is taken from the judgment so
5 rendered, the officer so appealing shall not hold the office during the
6 pendency of the appeal, but the office shall be filled as in case of a
7 vacancy.

14 (b) Willfully failing to comply with any other sanction imposed
15 upon a local elected officer pursuant to [NRS 233.175.] section 23
16 of this act.
17 Sec. 37. NRS 353.347 is hereby amended to read as follows:
18 353.347 1. [If] In relation to the Nevada Equal Rights
19 Commission, if the [Director of the Department of Employment,

25 advance from the State General Fund for the payment of authorized
26 expenses.

21 the occurrence of the alleged practice.
22  A complaint is timely if it is filed with an appropriate

14 complaint of the limitation on the period of time during which
15 a person may apply to the district court for relief pursuant to

29 section existed on January 1, 2019.
30 (b) If 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(e)(3)(A) is amended and the
31 Commission determines by regulation that the section, as
32 amended, provides greater protection for employees than that
33 section as it existed on January 1, 2019, the date prescribed
34 by 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(e)(3)(A), as amended.
35 Sec. 40. Section 22 of this act is hereby amended as follows:
36 Sec. 22. 1. When a complaint is filed whose
37 allegations if true would support a finding of unlawful
38 practice, the Commission shall determine whether to hold an
39 informal meeting to attempt a settlement of the dispute in
40 accordance with the regulations adopted pursuant to section
41 17 of this act. If the Commission determines to hold an

18 agreement must be made public unless the parties otherwise
19 agree and the Commission determines that disclosure is not
20 necessary to further the purposes of chapter 118 of NRS.
21 4. If the attempts at mediation or conciliation conducted
22 pursuant to subsection 2 fail [,] in a case involving an
23 unlawful practice in employment or public
24 accommodations, the Commission may hold a public hearing
25 on the matter. After the hearing, if the Commission
26 determines that an unlawful practice has occurred, the
27 Commission may:

29 within 10 calendar days upon any person found to have
30 engaged in the unlawful practice; and
31 (b) Order the person to:
32 (1) Cease and desist from the unlawful practice. The
33 order must include, without limitation, the corrective action
34 the person must take.

37 person is entitled, including, without limitation, rehiring, back
38 pay for a period described in subsection [4,] 5, annual leave
39 time, sick leave time or pay, other fringe benefits and

43 of Financial Institutions, on January 1 or July 1, as the case
44 may be, immediately preceding the date of the decision, plus

5 amount determined to be appropriate by the Commission for
6 lost wages that would have been earned in the absence of
7 discrimination or other economic damages resulting from the
8 discrimination, including, without limitation, lost payment for
9 overtime, shift differential, cost of living adjustments, merit
10 increases or promotions, or other fringe benefits.
11 (4) In cases involving an unlawful employment
12 practice committed by an employer with 50 or more
13 employees that the Commission determines was willful, pay a
14 civil penalty of:
15 (I) For the first unlawful employment practice that
16 the person has engaged in during the immediately preceding 5
17 years which the Commission determines was willful, not
18 more than $5,000.
19 (II) For the second unlawful employment practice
20 that the person has engaged in during the immediately
21 preceding 5 years which the Commission determines was
22 willful, not more than $10,000.
23 (III) For the third and any subsequent unlawful
24 employment practice that the person has engaged in during
25 the immediately preceding 5 years which the Commission
26 determines was willful, not more than $15,000.
27 [4.] 5. For the purposes of subparagraph (2) of
28 paragraph (b) of subsection [3,] 4, the period for back pay
29 must not exceed a period beginning 2 years before the date on
30 which the complaint was filed and ending on the date the
31 Commission issues an order pursuant to paragraph (b) of
32 subsection [3.] 4.
33 [5.] 6. Before imposing a civil penalty pursuant to
34 subparagraph (4) of paragraph (b) of subsection [3,] 4, the
35 Commission must allow the person found to have willfully
36 engaged in an unlawful employment practice 30 days to take
37 corrective action from the date of service of the order made
38 pursuant to paragraph (a) of subsection [3.] 4. If the person
39 takes such corrective action, the Commission shall not
40 impose the civil penalty.
41 [6.] 7. If the attempts at mediation or conciliation fail
42 in a case involving an unlawful housing practice:
43 (a) The complainant or the person against whom the
44 complaint was filed may elect to have the claims included in
45 the complaint decided in a court of competent jurisdiction.
-
*SB160*

– 26 –
1 If the court determines that the person against whom the
2 complaint was filed has committed an unlawful housing
3 practice, the court may:
4 (1) Award to the complainant actual damages and,
5 within the limitations prescribed by federal law, punitive
6 damages;
7 (2) Award to the prevailing party costs and
8 reasonable attorney’s fees; and
9 (3) Order such other relief as the court deems
10 appropriate, including, without limitation:
11 (I) Ordering a permanent or temporary
12 injunction;
13 (II) Issuing a temporary restraining order; or
14 (III) Enjoining the defendant from continuing the
15 unlawful practice or taking other affirmative action.
16 (b) If an election is not made pursuant to paragraph (a),
17 the Commission shall hold a public hearing on the matter.
18 After the hearing, if the Commission determines that an
19 unlawful practice has occurred, the Commission may:
20 (1) Serve a copy of the findings of fact within 10 days
21 upon any person found to have engaged in the unlawful
22 practice;
23 (2) Order the person to cease and desist from the
24 unlawful practice;
25 (3) Award to the complainant actual damages; and
26 (4) Impose a civil penalty of not more than $25,000
27 upon the person who committed the unlawful
28 discriminatory practice.
29 8. The order of the Commission is a final decision in a
30 contested case for the purpose of judicial review. If the
31 person fails to comply with the order, the Commission shall
32 apply to the district court for an order compelling compliance,
33 but failure or delay on the part of the Commission does not
34 prejudice the right of an aggrieved party to judicial review.
35 The court shall issue the order unless it finds that the findings
36 or order of the Commission are not supported by substantial
37 evidence or are otherwise arbitrary or capricious. If the court
38 upholds the order of the Commission and finds that the
39 person has violated the order by failing to cease and desist
40 from the unlawful practice or to make the payment ordered,
41 the court shall award the aggrieved party actual damages for
42 any economic loss and no more.
43 [7.] 9. After the Commission has held a public hearing
44 and rendered a decision, the complainant is barred from
-
*SB160*

– 27 –
1 proceeding on the same facts and legal theory before any
2 other administrative body or officer.
3 [8.] 10. For the purposes of this section, an unlawful
4 employment practice shall be deemed to be willful if a person
5 engages in the practice with knowledge that it is unlawful or
6 with reckless indifference to whether it is lawful or unlawful.
7 Sec. 41. 1. As soon as practicable after July 1, 2025, the
8 Attorney General shall appoint to the Nevada Equal Rights
9 Commission the members required by section 8 of this act to be
10 appointed to the Commission.
11 2. The persons who are members of the Nevada Equal Rights
12 Commission created by NRS 233.030, as that section existed on
13 June 30, 2025, continue to serve as members until the Attorney
14 General appoints members to the Commission pursuant to section 8
15 of this act.
16 Sec. 42. 1. As soon as practicable after July 1, 2025, the
17 Attorney General shall appoint to the Nevada Equal Rights
18 Commission the Administrator of the Commission required by

22 otherwise qualified to serve as the Administrator on that date may
23 continue to serve in that capacity until his or her successor is
24 appointed by the Attorney General pursuant to section 10 of this act.
25 Sec. 43. 1. Any administrative regulations adopted by an
26 officer or an agency whose name has been changed or whose
27 responsibilities have been transferred pursuant to the provisions of
28 this act to another officer or agency remain in force until amended
29 by the officer or agency to which the responsibility for the adoption
30 of the regulations has been transferred.
31 2. Any contracts or other agreements entered into by an officer
32 or agency whose name has been changed or whose responsibilities
33 have been transferred pursuant to the provisions of this act to
34 another officer or agency are binding upon the officer or agency to
35 which the responsibility for the administration of the provisions of
36 the contract or other agreement has been transferred. Such contracts
37 and other agreements may be enforced by the officer or agency to
38 which the responsibility for the enforcement of the provisions of the
39 contract or other agreement has been transferred.
40 3. Any action taken by an officer or agency whose name has
41 been changed or whose responsibilities have been transferred
42 pursuant to the provisions of this act to another officer or agency
43 remains in effect as if taken by the officer or agency to which the
44 responsibility for the enforcement of such actions has been
45 transferred.
