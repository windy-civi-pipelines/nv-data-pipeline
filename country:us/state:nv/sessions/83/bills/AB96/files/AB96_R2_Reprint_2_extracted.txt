8 population is 100,000 or more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties) includes a
9 heat mitigation plan. Section 2 of this bill sets forth the requirements for the heat
10 mitigation plan, which is to be included as part of a conservation element of a
11 master plan, including a plan to develop heat mitigation strategies such as public
