CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to land use planning; requiring the governing
body of certain cities and counties to include a heat
mitigation plan in the conservation element of the master
plan; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law requires a planning commission to develop a master plan as a
comprehensive, long-term general plan for the physical development of the city,
county or region. A master plan may include certain elements as appropriate to the
city, county or region, with the exception of certain cities and counties which must
include all or a portion of certain elements in a master plan. (NRS

Section 2:

Section 3:
Sections 1 and 3 of this bill require that the master plan in a county whose
population is 100,000 or more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties) includes a
heat mitigation plan. Section 2 of this bill sets forth the requirements for the heat
mitigation plan, which is to be included as part of a conservation element of a
master plan, including a plan to develop heat mitigation strategies such as public
cooling spaces, public drinking water and shade over paved surfaces.
