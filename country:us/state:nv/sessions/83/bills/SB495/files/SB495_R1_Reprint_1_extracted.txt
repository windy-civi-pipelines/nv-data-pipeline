Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Department of Health and Human Services, or the
2 Director of the Department or the divisions thereof, to conduct various programs
3 for the improvement of public health and health care in this State. (NRS 433.702-
4 433.744, 439.4921-439.525, 439.529-439.5297, 439.630, 439A.111-439A.185,
5 439A.200-439A.290, 442.710-442.745, 457.230-457.280, 458.025, 458A.090,
6 458A.100, 458A.110)
7 Section 7 of this bill requires the Director to conduct a biennial assessment of
8 the health care workforce needs of this State, which must identify health care
9 professions and specialties, types of clinical services and expertise and geographic
10 areas experiencing critical shortages of providers of health care or clinical services
11 or expertise. Section 42 of this bill provides that such an assessment is not a
12 regulation and is therefore not subject to notice-and-comment rulemaking.
13 Existing law requires the Director to prescribe by regulation a framework for
14 the electronic maintenance, transmittal and exchange of electronic health records,
15 prescriptions, health-related information and electronic signatures and requirements
16 for electronic equivalents of written entries or written approvals. With certain
17 exceptions, existing law requires various entities involved in health care, including
18 persons and facilities that provide health care, to maintain, transmit and exchange
19 health information in accordance with those regulations. (NRS 439.589) Section
20 3.6 of this bill prohibits those regulations from authorizing such a person or entity
21 to comply with that requirement by connecting with a health information exchange
22 or utilizing any other service that charges a fee for providing electronic health
23 records to such a person or entity or a patient upon request. Section 72.8 of this
24 bill: (1) requires a custodian of health care records to furnish electronic health
25 records to a patient or certain other entities upon the request of a patient within 7
26 business days; and (2) prohibits a custodian of health care records from charging a
27 fee to furnish health care records under such circumstances.
28 Sections 3.3, 72.3 and 126 of this bill limit the health care providers that must
29 maintain, transmit and exchange health information electronically to medical
30 facilities and high-level providers of health care. Section 1 of this bill defines the
31 term “high-level provider of health care” to mean a physician, physician assistant,
32 dentist, advanced practice registered nurse, chiropractic physician, podiatric
33 physician or physical therapist. Section 3.3 additionally exempts from requirements
34 to maintain, transmit and exchange health information electronically high-level
35 providers of health care whose solo or group practices are under a certain size.
36 However, section 3.3 requires such high-level providers of health care to furnish
37 the medical records of a patient electronically to the patient or another person or
38 entity upon request of the patient. Section 4.5 of this bill makes conforming
39 changes to revise the applicability of a provision requiring the Department to notify
40 the licensing board of a provider who fails to comply with requirements governing
41 the electronic maintenance, transmittal and exchange of health information. Section
42 1.5 of this bill establishes the applicability of the definition set forth in section 1,
43 and sections 43, 45.5, 67.9, 116.3 and 116.7 of this bill make other conforming
-
*SB495_R1*
– 3 –
44 changes to indicate the proper placement of section 1 in the Nevada Revised
45 Statutes. Section 72.5 of this bill updates internal references changed by
46 section 72.3.
47 Existing law prohibits a person or entity from operating an independent center
48 for emergency medical care without a license issued by the Division of Public and
49 Behavioral Health of the Department. (NRS 449.030) Section 22.5 of this bill
50 requires a facility that is structurally separate from the hospital and provides
51 services for the treatment of a medical emergency, including such a facility that is
52 owned or operated by, or otherwise part of, a hospital, to be licensed as an
53 independent center for emergency medical care. (NRS 449.0151, 449.030) Sections
54 24.3 and 24.5 of this bill prohibit the Division or the State Board of Health from
55 charging a fee for the issuance of such a license. Section 24.8 of this bill prohibits
56 the Division from issuing a license to operate an independent center for emergency
57 medical care that is located within a 5 mile radius of another independent center for
58 emergency medical care or a hospital with an emergency department. However,
59 section 120.6 of this bill requires the Division to issue a license to certain such
60 independent centers for emergency medical care that are currently licensed or had
61 taken certain steps toward operating by January 1, 2025. Section 26.5 of this bill
62 requires an independent center for emergency medical care to provide urgent care
63 services during all operating hours and imposes certain additional requirements
64 related to the provision of such urgent care, except that section 120.3 of this bill
65 exempts from that requirement independent centers for emergency medical care
66 that are licensed on the date on which this bill is enacted.
67 Existing law establishes programs to increase awareness of information
68 concerning hospitals and surgical centers for ambulatory patients. (NRS 439A.200-
69 439A.290) Section 9.5 of this bill requires the Department to establish a similar
70 program to increase awareness of information concerning independent centers for
71 emergency medical care. Sections 9.5, 10.5, 12.5, 13.5 and 27.3 of this bill provide
72 for the Department to collect certain information on the operations of independent
73 centers for emergency medical care and the outcomes for patients treated by
74 independent centers for emergency medical care. To facilitate such reporting,
75 section 27.3 requires an independent center for emergency medical care to use the
76 same form prescribed by the Director for discharging patients as a hospital is
77 currently required to use. Section 95.5 of this bill makes a conforming change to
78 reflect that independent centers for emergency medical care will be using the same
79 form. Sections 12.5 and 13.5 require the Department to: (1) make certain
80 information concerning independent centers for emergency medical care available
81 upon request; and (2) post certain information concerning independent centers for
82 emergency medical care on an Internet website maintained by the Department.
83 Sections 11.2 and 41.5 of this bill make conforming changes to add references to
84 independent centers for emergency medical care to sections that discuss the
85 program and associated website. Section 8.5 of this bill defines the term
86 “independent center for emergency medical care” for that purpose. Section 11.5 of
87 this bill establishes the applicability of certain definitions. Section 27.7 of this bill
88 requires a report prepared by the Director on the status of the programs to increase
89 public awareness of information concerning hospitals and surgical centers for
90 ambulatory patients to additionally include information on the status of the program
91 to increase awareness of information concerning independent centers for
92 emergency medical care. Section 51.3 of this bill requires the Director of the
93 Department, to the extent that money is available, to include under Medicaid a
94 system of value-based payments for care provided by independent centers for
95 emergency medical care to recipients of Medicaid.
96 Existing law authorizes a court, upon a petition, to order the sealing of records
97 of certain convictions if the person who was convicted: (1) has not been convicted
98 of any additional offense, except for minor traffic violations, for a specified period
-
*SB495_R1*
– 4 –
99 of time; and (2) does not have charges pending for any offense, except for minor
100 traffic violations. (NRS 179.245) Existing law also authorizes a court, upon a
101 petition, to order the sealing of records of an arrest where the charges were
102 dismissed, the prosecutor declined to prosecute or the person who was arrested was
103 acquitted. (NRS 179.255) Section 32.5 of this bill authorizes the Department or the
104 Division of Health Care Financing and Policy of the Department to review certain
105 sealed records for the purpose of determining the suitability of the person to whom
106 the records pertain to serve as a provider of services under Medicaid or to own or
107 serve as an officer, managing employee or managing agent of such a provider of
108 services.
109 Existing law prescribes a procedure for conducting a hearing to review an
110 action taken against a provider of services under Medicaid. (NRS 422.306) Section
111 51.5 of this bill requires such a provider of services to maintain and provide certain
112 documents to the Department for the purpose of verifying claims. Section 51.5
113 authorizes the Department to deny a claim or recover money already paid if the
114 Department is unable to verify the claim. Section 51.8 of this bill: (1) prescribes a
115 process for the Department to review claims for appropriateness and propriety; and
116 (2) authorizes the Department to deny or recover any amount paid pursuant to such
117 a claim or take certain actions based on such a review. Section 119.5 of this bill
118 makes an appropriation to the Division of Health Care Financing and Policy of the
119 Department and authorizes the expenditure of certain other money to carry out
120 sections 51.3-51.8.
121 Section 67 of this bill: (1) creates the Office of Mental Health within the
122 Department; and (2) requires the Director to appoint the Executive Director of the
123 Office. Section 67.2 of this bill requires the Office to perform certain duties to
124 improve access to and the effectiveness of mental health services in this State.
125 Section 67.4 of this bill requires the Office to perform certain additional duties
126 related to the mental and behavioral health of children. Sections 67.6-67.8 of this
127 bill require the subcommittee on the mental health of children of the Commission
128 on Behavioral Health and each mental health consortium to support those duties.
129 Section 67.5 of this bill requires the Office to submit a biennial report to the
130 Legislature. Section 66.6 of this bill defines the term “Office” for the purposes of
131 sections 67-67.5 to refer to the Office of Mental Health. Senate Bill No. 494 of this
132 legislative session proposes to create a new department in the Executive Branch of
133 State Government known as the Nevada Health Authority to perform certain duties
134 related to health care, including behavioral health care, in this State. Section 121.5
135 of this bill transfers the Office to the Nevada Health Authority if Senate Bill No.
136 494 is enacted.
137 Section 89 of this bill requires the Board of Psychological Examiners to: (1)
138 take certain actions to incentivize licensees to receive continuing education
139 concerning the mental health needs of patients in rural areas; and (2) establish a
140 program to recognize psychologists who provide at least 200 hours of services
141 through telehealth to such patients.
142 Sections 20, 46, 50, 75, 85, 109 and 113 of this bill prescribe requirements to
143 expedite the process of credentialing providers of health care to participate in
144 public and private health insurance plans. Beginning on January 1, 2027, sections
145 117 and 118 of this bill require insurers that issue such plans, or entities to which
146 such insurers delegate credentialing functions, to process least 95 percent of
147 complete requests for such credentialing not later than 60 days after receiving all of
148 the information necessary to complete such a request. Beginning on January 1,
149 2027, section 21 of this bill similarly requires a hospital to process at least 95
150 percent of complete requests from providers of health care for privileges to perform
151 services at the hospital not later than 60 days after receiving all of the information
152 necessary to complete such a request.

153 Existing law authorizes an emergency medical technician, advanced emergency
154 medical technician or paramedic who holds the proper endorsement to provide
155 services, known as community paramedicine services, to patients who do not
156 require emergency medical transportation. (NRS 450B.1993) Sections 29-31 of this
157 bill authorize paramedics to serve as employees or volunteers in a hospital under
158 certain circumstances and with certain limitations.
159 Existing law provides that a noncompetition covenant is void unless the
160 covenant: (1) is supported by valuable consideration; (2) does not impose any
161 restraint that is greater than is required for the protection of the employer; (3) does
162 not impose any undue hardship on the employee; and (4) imposes restrictions that
163 are appropriately related to the consideration for the covenant. (NRS 613.195)
164 Section 71 of this bill provides that a noncompetition covenant may not apply to a
165 provider of health care whose primary duties involve providing clinical care to
166 patients and who is not employed or contracted to primarily perform administrative
167 tasks.
168 Sections 74 and 84 of this bill require the Board of Medical Examiners and the
169 State Board of Osteopathic Medicine, respectively, to establish by regulation a
170 procedure for prioritizing applications for licensure as a physician or osteopathic
171 physician of applicants who plan to: (1) serve underserved geographic areas or
172 populations in this State; or (2) practice a specialty for which there is a shortage in
173 this State. Sections 76 and 86 of this bill require certain reports submitted by those
174 Boards to the Governor and Legislature to include information relating to the
175 efficiency of the process for licensing physicians or osteopathic physicians, as
176 applicable.
177 Existing law requires the Director to: (1) develop and make available to each
178 professional licensing board that licenses, certifies or registers providers of health
179 care an electronic data request that solicits certain information relating to the
180 demographics and practices of providers of health care; and (2) establish and
181 maintain a database of information collected through the data request. (NRS
182 439A.116) Under existing law, providers of health care applying to renew a license,
183 certificate or registration may, but are not required to, complete the data request.
184 (NRS 450B.805, 630.2671, 630A.327, 631.332, 632.3423, 633.4716, 634.1303,
185 634A.169, 635.111, 636.262, 637.145, 637B.192, 639.183, 640.152, 640A.185,
186 640B.405, 640D.135, 640E.225, 641.2215, 641A.217, 641B.281, 641C.455,
187 652.126) Sections 76.5, 82.3, 82.6, 86.2-86.8 and 89.2-89.9 of this bill make
188 completion of the data request mandatory to renew a license, certificate or
189 registration issued by: (1) the Board of Medical Examiners; (2) the Board of Dental
190 Examiners of Nevada; (3) the State Board of Nursing; (4) the State Board of
191 Osteopathic Medicine; (5) the State Board of Podiatry; (6) the Nevada State Board
192 of Optometry; (7) the Board of Dispensing Opticians; (8) the Board of
193 Psychological Examiners; (9) the Board of Examiners for Marriage and Family
194 Therapists and Clinical Professional Counselors; (10) the Board of Examiners for
195 Social Workers; (11) the Board of Examiners for Alcohol, Drug and Gambling
196 Counselors; and (12) the Board of Applied Behavior Analysis. Section 42.5 of this
197 bill makes a conforming change to ensure the confidentiality of information
198 submitted through such a data request.
199 Existing law requires an applicant for licensure as a dental hygienist to have
200 graduated from an accredited program of dental hygiene that meets certain
201 requirements. (NRS 631.290) Sections 77 and 79 of this bill authorize the Board of
202 Dental Examiners of Nevada to establish by regulation an alternative training
203 pathway involving a course of training under the supervision of a licensed dentist
204 that an applicant for such a license may complete instead of graduating from such a
205 program. Section 77 requires an applicant who has completed the alternative
206 training pathway to have also successfully passed: (1) a competency examination
207 conducted by the supervising dentist; (2) a written examination; and (3) a clinical
-
*SB495_R1*
– 6 –
208 examination approved by the Board. Section 78 of this bill requires such an
209 applicant to submit with his or her application for licensure proof that he or she has
210 passed those examinations. Section 77 provides that a person who completes the
211 alternative training pathway is only eligible for licensure if he or she began the
212 pathway during a biennium during which there was shortage of dental hygienists, as
213 documented by the assessment conducted pursuant to section 7. Section 77
214 requires the Board to adopt regulations establishing the scope of practice of a dental
215 hygienist who has completed the alternative training pathway. Section 81 of this
216 bill prohibits a dental hygienist who has completed the alternative training pathway
217 and has not subsequently graduated from an accredited program of dental hygiene
218 from prescribing and dispensing preventive agents.
219 Existing law requires the Department to administer Medicaid and the
220 Children’s Health Insurance Program. (NRS 422.270) Existing federal law
221 authorizes: (1) a hospital to elect to make determinations concerning whether
222 certain persons are presumptively eligible for Medicaid; and (2) a state to allow
223 certain other entities to make such determinations. (42 U.S.C. §§ 1396a(a)(47),
224 1396r-1, 1396r-1a, 1396r-1b, 1396r-1c) Section 51 of this bill requires the
225 Department to take certain measures to facilitate such presumptive eligibility
226 determinations by the personnel of hospitals and qualified community-based
227 organizations. Section 51 also requires the Department to audit such entities to
228 ensure that the presumptive eligibility determinations made by the personnel of
229 those entities are accurate and comply with applicable law.
230 Existing law authorizes certain health insurers to require prior authorization
231 before an insured may receive coverage for medical and dental care in certain
232 circumstances. If an insurer requires prior authorization, existing law requires the
233 insurer to: (1) file its procedure for obtaining prior authorization with the
234 Commissioner of Insurance for approval; and (2) respond to a request for prior
235 authorization within 20 days after receiving the request. (NRS 687B.225)
236 Beginning on January 1, 2028, sections 47, 53-62, 69, 97-108 and 110 of this bill
237 establish additional requirements relating to the use of prior authorization for
238 medical care by health insurers, including Medicaid, the Children’s Health
239 Insurance Program and insurance for state employees, as well as certain entities
240 with which such insurers contract to perform functions relating to prior
241 authorization. Sections 53.5, 54, 55 and 98-100 define certain terms, and sections
242 53 and 97 establish the applicability of those definitions. Section 101.6 of this bill
243 requires certain insurers and other entities that employ or utilize an artificial
244 intelligence system or automated decision tool to process requests for prior
245 authorization to transmit a notice to each insured that: (1) discloses the insurer’s use
246 of the system or tool to process requests for prior authorization; and (2) describes
247 certain aspects of the system or tool. Sections 56 and 110 require an insurer or
248 other entity that performs functions relating to prior authorization to respond to a
249 request for prior authorization within a specified period of time. If an insurer or
250 other entity that performs functions relating to prior authorization is unable to
251 approve or deny a request for prior authorization within that time period, sections
252 56 and 110 require the insurer or entity to notify the insured and his or her provider
253 of health care of the delay. Sections 58 and 102 prescribe the required contents of
254 that notice. Sections 59 and 103 require an insurer or other entity that performs
255 functions relating to prior authorization to provide similar notice upon denying a
256 request for prior authorization and establish a process to appeal such a denial.
257 Sections 56 and 110 prohibit insurers and other entities that perform functions
258 relating to prior authorization from requiring prior authorization for covered
259 emergency services. Sections 57 and 101 require insurers and other entities that
260 perform functions relating to prior authorization to implement an electronic system
261 for receiving and processing requests for prior authorization. Sections 22 and 72 of
-
*SB495_R1*
– 7 –
262 this bill require certain medical facilities and providers of health care to submit
263 requests for prior authorization through those systems.
264 Sections 60 and 104 limit the circumstances under which an insurer or other
265 entity that performs functions relating to prior authorization may: (1) revoke the
266 approval of a request for prior authorization; (2) delay or deny payment for care to
267 which such a request pertains; or (3) assign a lower billing code or otherwise
268 reduce the payment for such care. Sections 61 and 105 prescribe certain
269 requirements to ensure the continuity of care for an insured whose benefits are
270 terminated or who switches health insurance plans. Sections 62 and 106 provide
271 for the reporting and publication of certain information relating to prior
272 authorization and the payment of claims. Section 107 establishes the Gold Card
273 Exemption Program to exempt providers of health care whose requests for prior
274 authorization are approved at a rate of at least 95 percent from the requirement to
275 obtain prior authorization for certain services. Section 56 requires the Department,
276 with respect to Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program, or a
277 Medicaid managed care organization to grant Gold Card Exemptions to providers
278 of health care in accordance with section 107 except in certain circumstances.
279 Section 63 of this bill requires Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance
280 Program to comply with certain requirements governing the prompt payment of
281 claims that apply under existing law to private insurers and the Public Employees’
282 Benefits Program. (NRS 683A.0879, 689A.410, 689B.255, 689C.355, 689A.188,
283 695B.2505, 695C.185, 695D.215) Section 63 additionally requires Medicaid to
284 comply with certain federal requirements governing the timely payment of claims
285 under Medicaid. (42 C.F.R. § 447.45(d)(2),(3))
286 Section 108 requires the Commissioner to adopt regulations prescribing: (1)
287 requirements to ensure that applicants for certain certificates or approval to engage
288 in business related to insurance are equipped to comply with certain requirements
289 governing prior authorization and the payment of health claims; and (2) criteria to
290 ensure that an insurer or other entity that enters into a contract to provide services
291 for certain public insurance programs is in compliance with those requirements.
292 Sections 45, 91, 93-95 and 116 of this bill make various changes to establish the
293 applicability of those regulations. Section 92 of this bill makes a conforming
294 change to indicate the proper placement of section 91 in the Nevada Revised
295 Statutes. Section 108 additionally requires the Commissioner to perform certain
296 other duties relating to the implementation and enforcement of requirements
297 governing prior authorization and the payment of health claims. Section 65 of this
298 bill requires the prior authorization policies and procedures for prescription drugs
299 under Medicaid to comply with sections 53-63. Section 41 of this bill requires the
300 Director of the Department to administer sections 50-63 in the same manner as
301 other provisions governing Medicaid. Sections 47, 69 and 114 of this bill make
302 sections 97-108 and 110 applicable to insurance for state and private employees
303 and nonprofit hospital or medical services corporations. Section 101.3 of this bill
304 makes sections 101.8-105 and 110 inapplicable to Medicaid managed care
305 organizations, which are instead required to comply with sections 56 and 58-61.
306 Sections 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 90, 111 and 112 of this bill make conforming changes
307 concerning the applicability and enforcement of sections 20-22 and 109.
308 Section 121 of this bill requires the Patient Protection Commission to conduct a
309 study during the 2025-2026 interim concerning academic medical centers in this
310 State, and section 120 of this bill appropriates money for the study.

4 433.744, 439.4921-439.525, 439.529-439.5297, 439.630, 439A.111-439A.185,
5 439A.200-439A.290, 442.710-442.745, 457.230-457.280, 458.025, 458A.090,
6 458A.100, 458A.110)
7 Section 7 of this bill requires the Director to conduct a biennial assessment of
8 the health care workforce needs of this State, which must identify health care
9 professions and specialties, types of clinical services and expertise and geographic
10 areas experiencing critical shortages of providers of health care or clinical services
11 or expertise. Section 42 of this bill provides that such an assessment is not a
12 regulation and is therefore not subject to notice-and-comment rulemaking.
13 Existing law requires the Director to prescribe by regulation a framework for
14 the electronic maintenance, transmittal and exchange of electronic health records,
15 prescriptions, health-related information and electronic signatures and requirements
16 for electronic equivalents of written entries or written approvals. With certain
17 exceptions, existing law requires various entities involved in health care, including
18 persons and facilities that provide health care, to maintain, transmit and exchange
19 health information in accordance with those regulations. (NRS 439.589) Section
20 3.6 of this bill prohibits those regulations from authorizing such a person or entity
21 to comply with that requirement by connecting with a health information exchange
22 or utilizing any other service that charges a fee for providing electronic health
23 records to such a person or entity or a patient upon request. Section 72.8 of this
24 bill: (1) requires a custodian of health care records to furnish electronic health
25 records to a patient or certain other entities upon the request of a patient within 7
26 business days; and (2) prohibits a custodian of health care records from charging a
27 fee to furnish health care records under such circumstances.
28 Sections 3.3, 72.3 and 126 of this bill limit the health care providers that must
29 maintain, transmit and exchange health information electronically to medical
30 facilities and high-level providers of health care. Section 1 of this bill defines the
31 term “high-level provider of health care” to mean a physician, physician assistant,
32 dentist, advanced practice registered nurse, chiropractic physician, podiatric
33 physician or physical therapist. Section 3.3 additionally exempts from requirements
34 to maintain, transmit and exchange health information electronically high-level
35 providers of health care whose solo or group practices are under a certain size.
36 However, section 3.3 requires such high-level providers of health care to furnish
37 the medical records of a patient electronically to the patient or another person or
38 entity upon request of the patient. Section 4.5 of this bill makes conforming
39 changes to revise the applicability of a provision requiring the Department to notify
40 the licensing board of a provider who fails to comply with requirements governing
41 the electronic maintenance, transmittal and exchange of health information. Section
42 1.5 of this bill establishes the applicability of the definition set forth in section 1,
43 and sections 43, 45.5, 67.9, 116.3 and 116.7 of this bill make other conforming
-
*SB495_R1*

– 3 –
44 changes to indicate the proper placement of section 1 in the Nevada Revised
45 Statutes. Section 72.5 of this bill updates internal references changed by
46 section 72.3.
47 Existing law prohibits a person or entity from operating an independent center
48 for emergency medical care without a license issued by the Division of Public and
49 Behavioral Health of the Department. (NRS 449.030) Section 22.5 of this bill
50 requires a facility that is structurally separate from the hospital and provides
51 services for the treatment of a medical emergency, including such a facility that is
52 owned or operated by, or otherwise part of, a hospital, to be licensed as an
53 independent center for emergency medical care. (NRS 449.0151, 449.030) Sections
54 24.3 and 24.5 of this bill prohibit the Division or the State Board of Health from
55 charging a fee for the issuance of such a license. Section 24.8 of this bill prohibits
56 the Division from issuing a license to operate an independent center for emergency
57 medical care that is located within a 5 mile radius of another independent center for
58 emergency medical care or a hospital with an emergency department. However,
59 section 120.6 of this bill requires the Division to issue a license to certain such
60 independent centers for emergency medical care that are currently licensed or had
61 taken certain steps toward operating by January 1, 2025. Section 26.5 of this bill
62 requires an independent center for emergency medical care to provide urgent care
63 services during all operating hours and imposes certain additional requirements
64 related to the provision of such urgent care, except that section 120.3 of this bill
65 exempts from that requirement independent centers for emergency medical care
66 that are licensed on the date on which this bill is enacted.
67 Existing law establishes programs to increase awareness of information
68 concerning hospitals and surgical centers for ambulatory patients. (NRS 439A.200-
69 439A.290) Section 9.5 of this bill requires the Department to establish a similar
70 program to increase awareness of information concerning independent centers for
71 emergency medical care. Sections 9.5, 10.5, 12.5, 13.5 and 27.3 of this bill provide
72 for the Department to collect certain information on the operations of independent
73 centers for emergency medical care and the outcomes for patients treated by
74 independent centers for emergency medical care. To facilitate such reporting,
75 section 27.3 requires an independent center for emergency medical care to use the
76 same form prescribed by the Director for discharging patients as a hospital is
77 currently required to use. Section 95.5 of this bill makes a conforming change to
78 reflect that independent centers for emergency medical care will be using the same
79 form. Sections 12.5 and 13.5 require the Department to: (1) make certain
80 information concerning independent centers for emergency medical care available
81 upon request; and (2) post certain information concerning independent centers for
82 emergency medical care on an Internet website maintained by the Department.
83 Sections 11.2 and 41.5 of this bill make conforming changes to add references to
84 independent centers for emergency medical care to sections that discuss the
85 program and associated website. Section 8.5 of this bill defines the term
86 “independent center for emergency medical care” for that purpose. Section 11.5 of
87 this bill establishes the applicability of certain definitions. Section 27.7 of this bill
88 requires a report prepared by the Director on the status of the programs to increase
89 public awareness of information concerning hospitals and surgical centers for
90 ambulatory patients to additionally include information on the status of the program
91 to increase awareness of information concerning independent centers for
92 emergency medical care. Section 51.3 of this bill requires the Director of the
93 Department, to the extent that money is available, to include under Medicaid a
94 system of value-based payments for care provided by independent centers for
95 emergency medical care to recipients of Medicaid.
96 Existing law authorizes a court, upon a petition, to order the sealing of records
97 of certain convictions if the person who was convicted: (1) has not been convicted
98 of any additional offense, except for minor traffic violations, for a specified period
-
*SB495_R1*

– 4 –
99 of time; and (2) does not have charges pending for any offense, except for minor
100 traffic violations. (NRS 179.245) Existing law also authorizes a court, upon a
101 petition, to order the sealing of records of an arrest where the charges were
102 dismissed, the prosecutor declined to prosecute or the person who was arrested was
103 acquitted. (NRS 179.255) Section 32.5 of this bill authorizes the Department or the
104 Division of Health Care Financing and Policy of the Department to review certain
105 sealed records for the purpose of determining the suitability of the person to whom
106 the records pertain to serve as a provider of services under Medicaid or to own or
107 serve as an officer, managing employee or managing agent of such a provider of
108 services.
109 Existing law prescribes a procedure for conducting a hearing to review an
110 action taken against a provider of services under Medicaid. (NRS 422.306) Section
111 51.5 of this bill requires such a provider of services to maintain and provide certain
112 documents to the Department for the purpose of verifying claims. Section 51.5
113 authorizes the Department to deny a claim or recover money already paid if the
114 Department is unable to verify the claim. Section 51.8 of this bill: (1) prescribes a
115 process for the Department to review claims for appropriateness and propriety; and
116 (2) authorizes the Department to deny or recover any amount paid pursuant to such
117 a claim or take certain actions based on such a review. Section 119.5 of this bill
118 makes an appropriation to the Division of Health Care Financing and Policy of the
119 Department and authorizes the expenditure of certain other money to carry out
120 sections 51.3-51.8.
121 Section 67 of this bill: (1) creates the Office of Mental Health within the
122 Department; and (2) requires the Director to appoint the Executive Director of the
123 Office. Section 67.2 of this bill requires the Office to perform certain duties to
124 improve access to and the effectiveness of mental health services in this State.
125 Section 67.4 of this bill requires the Office to perform certain additional duties
126 related to the mental and behavioral health of children. Sections 67.6-67.8 of this
127 bill require the subcommittee on the mental health of children of the Commission
128 on Behavioral Health and each mental health consortium to support those duties.
129 Section 67.5 of this bill requires the Office to submit a biennial report to the
130 Legislature. Section 66.6 of this bill defines the term “Office” for the purposes of
131 sections 67-67.5 to refer to the Office of Mental Health. Senate Bill No. 494 of this
132 legislative session proposes to create a new department in the Executive Branch of
133 State Government known as the Nevada Health Authority to perform certain duties
134 related to health care, including behavioral health care, in this State. Section 121.5
135 of this bill transfers the Office to the Nevada Health Authority if Senate Bill No.
136 494 is enacted.
137 Section 89 of this bill requires the Board of Psychological Examiners to: (1)
138 take certain actions to incentivize licensees to receive continuing education
139 concerning the mental health needs of patients in rural areas; and (2) establish a
140 program to recognize psychologists who provide at least 200 hours of services
141 through telehealth to such patients.
142 Sections 20, 46, 50, 75, 85, 109 and 113 of this bill prescribe requirements to
143 expedite the process of credentialing providers of health care to participate in
144 public and private health insurance plans. Beginning on January 1, 2027, sections
145 117 and 118 of this bill require insurers that issue such plans, or entities to which
146 such insurers delegate credentialing functions, to process least 95 percent of
147 complete requests for such credentialing not later than 60 days after receiving all of
148 the information necessary to complete such a request. Beginning on January 1,
149 2027, section 21 of this bill similarly requires a hospital to process at least 95
150 percent of complete requests from providers of health care for privileges to perform
151 services at the hospital not later than 60 days after receiving all of the information
152 necessary to complete such a request.

153 Existing law authorizes an emergency medical technician, advanced emergency
154 medical technician or paramedic who holds the proper endorsement to provide
155 services, known as community paramedicine services, to patients who do not
156 require emergency medical transportation. (NRS 450B.1993) Sections 29-31 of this
157 bill authorize paramedics to serve as employees or volunteers in a hospital under
158 certain circumstances and with certain limitations.
159 Existing law provides that a noncompetition covenant is void unless the
160 covenant: (1) is supported by valuable consideration; (2) does not impose any
161 restraint that is greater than is required for the protection of the employer; (3) does
162 not impose any undue hardship on the employee; and (4) imposes restrictions that
163 are appropriately related to the consideration for the covenant. (NRS 613.195)
164 Section 71 of this bill provides that a noncompetition covenant may not apply to a
165 provider of health care whose primary duties involve providing clinical care to
166 patients and who is not employed or contracted to primarily perform administrative
167 tasks.
168 Sections 74 and 84 of this bill require the Board of Medical Examiners and the
169 State Board of Osteopathic Medicine, respectively, to establish by regulation a
170 procedure for prioritizing applications for licensure as a physician or osteopathic
171 physician of applicants who plan to: (1) serve underserved geographic areas or
172 populations in this State; or (2) practice a specialty for which there is a shortage in
173 this State. Sections 76 and 86 of this bill require certain reports submitted by those
174 Boards to the Governor and Legislature to include information relating to the
175 efficiency of the process for licensing physicians or osteopathic physicians, as
176 applicable.
177 Existing law requires the Director to: (1) develop and make available to each
178 professional licensing board that licenses, certifies or registers providers of health
179 care an electronic data request that solicits certain information relating to the
180 demographics and practices of providers of health care; and (2) establish and
181 maintain a database of information collected through the data request. (NRS
182 439A.116) Under existing law, providers of health care applying to renew a license,
183 certificate or registration may, but are not required to, complete the data request.
184 (NRS 450B.805, 630.2671, 630A.327, 631.332, 632.3423, 633.4716, 634.1303,
185 634A.169, 635.111, 636.262, 637.145, 637B.192, 639.183, 640.152, 640A.185,
186 640B.405, 640D.135, 640E.225, 641.2215, 641A.217, 641B.281, 641C.455,
187 652.126) Sections 76.5, 82.3, 82.6, 86.2-86.8 and 89.2-89.9 of this bill make
188 completion of the data request mandatory to renew a license, certificate or
189 registration issued by: (1) the Board of Medical Examiners; (2) the Board of Dental
190 Examiners of Nevada; (3) the State Board of Nursing; (4) the State Board of
191 Osteopathic Medicine; (5) the State Board of Podiatry; (6) the Nevada State Board
192 of Optometry; (7) the Board of Dispensing Opticians; (8) the Board of
193 Psychological Examiners; (9) the Board of Examiners for Marriage and Family
194 Therapists and Clinical Professional Counselors; (10) the Board of Examiners for
195 Social Workers; (11) the Board of Examiners for Alcohol, Drug and Gambling
196 Counselors; and (12) the Board of Applied Behavior Analysis. Section 42.5 of this
197 bill makes a conforming change to ensure the confidentiality of information
198 submitted through such a data request.
199 Existing law requires an applicant for licensure as a dental hygienist to have
200 graduated from an accredited program of dental hygiene that meets certain
201 requirements. (NRS 631.290) Sections 77 and 79 of this bill authorize the Board of
202 Dental Examiners of Nevada to establish by regulation an alternative training
203 pathway involving a course of training under the supervision of a licensed dentist
204 that an applicant for such a license may complete instead of graduating from such a
205 program. Section 77 requires an applicant who has completed the alternative
206 training pathway to have also successfully passed: (1) a competency examination
207 conducted by the supervising dentist; (2) a written examination; and (3) a clinical
-
*SB495_R1*

– 6 –
208 examination approved by the Board. Section 78 of this bill requires such an
209 applicant to submit with his or her application for licensure proof that he or she has
210 passed those examinations. Section 77 provides that a person who completes the
211 alternative training pathway is only eligible for licensure if he or she began the
212 pathway during a biennium during which there was shortage of dental hygienists, as
213 documented by the assessment conducted pursuant to section 7. Section 77
214 requires the Board to adopt regulations establishing the scope of practice of a dental
215 hygienist who has completed the alternative training pathway. Section 81 of this
216 bill prohibits a dental hygienist who has completed the alternative training pathway
217 and has not subsequently graduated from an accredited program of dental hygiene
218 from prescribing and dispensing preventive agents.
219 Existing law requires the Department to administer Medicaid and the
220 Children’s Health Insurance Program. (NRS 422.270) Existing federal law
221 authorizes: (1) a hospital to elect to make determinations concerning whether
222 certain persons are presumptively eligible for Medicaid; and (2) a state to allow
223 certain other entities to make such determinations. (42 U.S.C. §§ 1396a(a)(47),
224 1396r-1, 1396r-1a, 1396r-1b, 1396r-1c) Section 51 of this bill requires the
225 Department to take certain measures to facilitate such presumptive eligibility
226 determinations by the personnel of hospitals and qualified community-based
227 organizations. Section 51 also requires the Department to audit such entities to
228 ensure that the presumptive eligibility determinations made by the personnel of
229 those entities are accurate and comply with applicable law.
230 Existing law authorizes certain health insurers to require prior authorization
231 before an insured may receive coverage for medical and dental care in certain
232 circumstances. If an insurer requires prior authorization, existing law requires the
233 insurer to: (1) file its procedure for obtaining prior authorization with the
234 Commissioner of Insurance for approval; and (2) respond to a request for prior
235 authorization within 20 days after receiving the request. (NRS 687B.225)
236 Beginning on January 1, 2028, sections 47, 53-62, 69, 97-108 and 110 of this bill
237 establish additional requirements relating to the use of prior authorization for
238 medical care by health insurers, including Medicaid, the Children’s Health
239 Insurance Program and insurance for state employees, as well as certain entities
240 with which such insurers contract to perform functions relating to prior
241 authorization. Sections 53.5, 54, 55 and 98-100 define certain terms, and sections
242 53 and 97 establish the applicability of those definitions. Section 101.6 of this bill
243 requires certain insurers and other entities that employ or utilize an artificial
244 intelligence system or automated decision tool to process requests for prior
245 authorization to transmit a notice to each insured that: (1) discloses the insurer’s use
246 of the system or tool to process requests for prior authorization; and (2) describes
247 certain aspects of the system or tool. Sections 56 and 110 require an insurer or
248 other entity that performs functions relating to prior authorization to respond to a
249 request for prior authorization within a specified period of time. If an insurer or
250 other entity that performs functions relating to prior authorization is unable to
251 approve or deny a request for prior authorization within that time period, sections
252 56 and 110 require the insurer or entity to notify the insured and his or her provider
253 of health care of the delay. Sections 58 and 102 prescribe the required contents of
254 that notice. Sections 59 and 103 require an insurer or other entity that performs
255 functions relating to prior authorization to provide similar notice upon denying a
256 request for prior authorization and establish a process to appeal such a denial.
257 Sections 56 and 110 prohibit insurers and other entities that perform functions
258 relating to prior authorization from requiring prior authorization for covered
259 emergency services. Sections 57 and 101 require insurers and other entities that
260 perform functions relating to prior authorization to implement an electronic system
261 for receiving and processing requests for prior authorization. Sections 22 and 72 of
-
*SB495_R1*

– 7 –
262 this bill require certain medical facilities and providers of health care to submit
263 requests for prior authorization through those systems.
264 Sections 60 and 104 limit the circumstances under which an insurer or other
265 entity that performs functions relating to prior authorization may: (1) revoke the
266 approval of a request for prior authorization; (2) delay or deny payment for care to
267 which such a request pertains; or (3) assign a lower billing code or otherwise
268 reduce the payment for such care. Sections 61 and 105 prescribe certain
269 requirements to ensure the continuity of care for an insured whose benefits are
270 terminated or who switches health insurance plans. Sections 62 and 106 provide
271 for the reporting and publication of certain information relating to prior
272 authorization and the payment of claims. Section 107 establishes the Gold Card
273 Exemption Program to exempt providers of health care whose requests for prior
274 authorization are approved at a rate of at least 95 percent from the requirement to
275 obtain prior authorization for certain services. Section 56 requires the Department,
276 with respect to Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program, or a
277 Medicaid managed care organization to grant Gold Card Exemptions to providers
278 of health care in accordance with section 107 except in certain circumstances.
279 Section 63 of this bill requires Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance
280 Program to comply with certain requirements governing the prompt payment of
281 claims that apply under existing law to private insurers and the Public Employees’
282 Benefits Program. (NRS 683A.0879, 689A.410, 689B.255, 689C.355, 689A.188,
283 695B.2505, 695C.185, 695D.215) Section 63 additionally requires Medicaid to
284 comply with certain federal requirements governing the timely payment of claims
285 under Medicaid. (42 C.F.R. § 447.45(d)(2),(3))
286 Section 108 requires the Commissioner to adopt regulations prescribing: (1)
287 requirements to ensure that applicants for certain certificates or approval to engage
288 in business related to insurance are equipped to comply with certain requirements
289 governing prior authorization and the payment of health claims; and (2) criteria to
290 ensure that an insurer or other entity that enters into a contract to provide services
291 for certain public insurance programs is in compliance with those requirements.
292 Sections 45, 91, 93-95 and 116 of this bill make various changes to establish the
293 applicability of those regulations. Section 92 of this bill makes a conforming
294 change to indicate the proper placement of section 91 in the Nevada Revised
295 Statutes. Section 108 additionally requires the Commissioner to perform certain
296 other duties relating to the implementation and enforcement of requirements
297 governing prior authorization and the payment of health claims. Section 65 of this
298 bill requires the prior authorization policies and procedures for prescription drugs
299 under Medicaid to comply with sections 53-63. Section 41 of this bill requires the
300 Director of the Department to administer sections 50-63 in the same manner as
301 other provisions governing Medicaid. Sections 47, 69 and 114 of this bill make
302 sections 97-108 and 110 applicable to insurance for state and private employees
303 and nonprofit hospital or medical services corporations. Section 101.3 of this bill
304 makes sections 101.8-105 and 110 inapplicable to Medicaid managed care
305 organizations, which are instead required to comply with sections 56 and 58-61.
306 Sections 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 90, 111 and 112 of this bill make conforming changes
307 concerning the applicability and enforcement of sections 20-22 and 109.
308 Section 121 of this bill requires the Patient Protection Commission to conduct a
309 study during the 2025-2026 interim concerning academic medical centers in this
310 State, and section 120 of this bill appropriates money for the study.
