Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Department of Health and Human Services, or the Director of
2 the Department or the divisions thereof, to conduct various programs for the improvement of
3 public health and health care in this State. (NRS 433.702-433.744, 439.4921-439.525,
4 439.529-439.5297, 439.630, 439A.111-439A.185, 439A.200-439A.290, 442.710-442.745,
5 457.230-457.280, 458.025, 458A.090, 458A.100, 458A.110) [Sections 2-18 of this bill
6 establish the Nevada Health Care Workforce and Access Program, which is a competitive
7 funding program managed by the Department to support projects to address critical shortages
8 of providers of health care in this State. Sections 3-5 define certain terms, and section 2
9 establishes the applicability of those definitions. Section 6 creates the Nevada Health Care
10 Workforce and Access Account to hold money to fund the Program. Section 119 of this bill
11 appropriates money into the Account. Section 6 authorizes the Director of the Department to
12 transfer money from the Account to another account for the purpose of obtaining additional
13 federal financial participation under Medicaid.]
14 Section 7 of this bill requires the Director to conduct a biennial assessment of the health
15 care workforce needs of this State, which must identify health care professions and
16 specialties, [populations] types of clinical services and expertise and geographic areas
17 experiencing critical shortages of providers of health care [.] or clinical services or expertise.
18 Section 42 of this bill provides that such an assessment is not a regulation and is therefore not
19 subject to notice-and-comment rulemaking. [Section 9 authorizes a person or entity to apply
20 for funding from the Account to support a project to address those critical shortages. Section 8
21 imposes certain additional requirements for a project to be eligible to receive such funding.
22 Sections 10 and 11 prescribe the process for the Department to review applications and
23 recommend applicants for funding. Section 12 provides for a joint committee consisting of the
24 membership of the Board of Economic Development and the Patient Protection Commission
25 to make the final determination concerning which applicants receive funding.
26 After the joint committee awards funding, section 13 requires the Department to enter
27 into a funding agreement with the recipient of the funding that outlines the terms and
28 conditions of the funding and the responsibilities of the recipient. Section 13 requires a
29 recipient of funding to notify and submit a revised plan to the Department if: (1) the recipient
30 significantly modifies or terminates a funded project; or (2) the amount of money available for
31 a funded project changes. Section 13 authorizes the Department to take certain actions in
32 response to such notice. Section 14 authorizes the Department and the Office of Finance to
33 provide certain oversight of a funded project. Section 15 authorizes the Department to suspend
34 or terminate funding or take certain other actions if it determines that the recipient of the
35 funding has failed to comply with state or federal law or regulations or a funding agreement.
36 Sections 16 and 17 provide for certain reporting concerning the Program, and section 18
37 requires the Department to adopt regulations governing the Program.]
38 Existing law requires the Director to prescribe by regulation a framework for the
39 electronic maintenance, transmittal and exchange of electronic health records,
40 prescriptions, health-related information and electronic signatures and requirements for
41 electronic equivalents of written entries or written approvals. With certain exceptions,
42 existing law requires various entities involved in health care, including persons and
43 facilities that provide health care, to maintain, transmit and exchange health
44 information in accordance with those regulations. (NRS 439.589) Section 3.6 of this bill
45 prohibits those regulations from authorizing such a person or entity to comply with that
46 requirement by connecting with a health information exchange or utilizing any other
47 service that charges a fee for providing electronic health records to such a person or
48 entity or a patient upon request. Section 72.8 of this bill: (1) requires a custodian of
Senate Amendment No. 942 to Senate Bill No. 495 Page 5
49 health care records to furnish electronic health records to a patient or certain other
50 entities upon the request of a patient within 7 business days; and (2) prohibits a
51 custodian of health care records from charging a fee to furnish health care records
52 under such circumstances.
53 Sections 3.3, 72.3 and 126 of this bill limit the health care providers that must
54 maintain, transmit and exchange health information electronically to medical facilities
55 and high-level providers of health care. Section 1 of this bill defines the term “high-level
56 provider of health care” to mean a physician, physician assistant, dentist, advanced
57 practice registered nurse, chiropractic physician, podiatric physician or physical
58 therapist. Section 3.3 additionally exempts from requirements to maintain, transmit and
59 exchange health information electronically high-level providers of health care whose solo
60 or group practices are under a certain size. However, section 3.3 requires such high-level
61 providers of health care to furnish the medical records of a patient electronically to the
62 patient or another person or entity upon request of the patient. Section 4.5 of this bill
63 makes conforming changes to revise the applicability of a provision requiring the
64 Department to notify the licensing board of a provider who fails to comply with
65 requirements governing the electronic maintenance, transmittal and exchange of health
66 information. Section 1.5 of this bill establishes the applicability of the definition set forth
67 in section 1, and sections 43, 45.5, 67.9, 116.3 and 116.7 of this bill make other
68 conforming changes to indicate the proper placement of section 1 in the Nevada Revised
69 Statutes. Section 72.5 of this bill updates internal references changed by section 72.3.
70 Existing law prohibits a person or entity from operating an independent center for
71 emergency medical care without a license issued by the Division of Public and
72 Behavioral Health of the Department. (NRS 449.030) Section 22.5 of this bill requires a
73 facility that is structurally separate from the hospital and provides services for the
74 treatment of a medical emergency, including such a facility that is owned or operated by,
75 or otherwise part of, a hospital, to be licensed as an independent center for emergency
76 medical care. (NRS 449.0151, 449.030) Sections 24.3 and 24.5 of this bill prohibit the
77 Division or the State Board of Health from charging a fee for the issuance of such a
78 license. Section 24.8 of this bill prohibits the Division from issuing a license to operate an
79 independent center for emergency medical care that is located within a 5 mile radius of
80 another independent center for emergency medical care or a hospital with an emergency
81 department. However, section 120.6 of this bill requires the Division to issue a license to
82 certain such independent centers for emergency medical care that are currently licensed
83 or had taken certain steps toward operating by January 1, 2025. Section 26.5 of this bill
84 requires an independent center for emergency medical care to provide urgent care
85 services during all operating hours and imposes certain additional requirements related
86 to the provision of such urgent care, except that section 120.3 of this bill exempts from
87 that requirement independent centers for emergency medical care that are licensed on
88 the date on which this bill is enacted.
89 Existing law establishes programs to increase awareness of information concerning
90 hospitals and surgical centers for ambulatory patients. (NRS 439A.200-439A.290)
91 Section 9.5 of this bill requires the Department to establish a similar program to increase
92 awareness of information concerning independent centers for emergency medical care.
93 Sections 9.5, 10.5, 12.5, 13.5 and 27.3 of this bill provide for the Department to collect
94 certain information on the operations of independent centers for emergency medical
95 care and the outcomes for patients treated by independent centers for emergency
96 medical care. To facilitate such reporting, section 27.3 requires an independent center
97 for emergency medical care to use the same form prescribed by the Director for
98 discharging patients as a hospital is currently required to use. Section 95.5 of this bill
99 makes a conforming change to reflect that independent centers for emergency medical
100 care will be using the same form. Sections 12.5 and 13.5 require the Department to: (1)
101 make certain information concerning independent centers for emergency medical care
102 available upon request; and (2) post certain information concerning independent centers
103 for emergency medical care on an Internet website maintained by the Department.
104 Sections 11.2 and 41.5 of this bill make conforming changes to add references to
105 independent centers for emergency medical care to sections that discuss the program
106 and associated website. Section 8.5 of this bill defines the term “independent center for
107 emergency medical care” for that purpose. Section 11.5 of this bill establishes the
Senate Amendment No. 942 to Senate Bill No. 495 Page 6
108 applicability of certain definitions. Section 27.7 of this bill requires a report prepared by
109 the Director on the status of the programs to increase public awareness of information
110 concerning hospitals and surgical centers for ambulatory patients to additionally include
111 information on the status of the program to increase awareness of information
112 concerning independent centers for emergency medical care. Section 51.3 of this bill
113 requires the Director of the Department, to the extent that money is available, to include
114 under Medicaid a system of value-based payments for care provided by independent
115 centers for emergency medical care to recipients of Medicaid.
116 Existing law authorizes a court, upon a petition, to order the sealing of records of
117 certain convictions if the person who was convicted: (1) has not been convicted of any
118 additional offense, except for minor traffic violations, for a specified period of time; and
119 (2) does not have charges pending for any offense, except for minor traffic violations.
120 (NRS 179.245) Existing law also authorizes a court, upon a petition, to order the sealing
121 of records of an arrest where the charges were dismissed, the prosecutor declined to
122 prosecute or the person who was arrested was acquitted. (NRS 179.255) Section 32.5 of
123 this bill authorizes the Department or the Division of Health Care Financing and Policy
124 of the Department to review certain sealed records for the purpose of determining the
125 suitability of the person to whom the records pertain to serve as a provider of services
126 under Medicaid or to own or serve as an officer, managing employee or managing agent
127 of such a provider of services.
128 Existing law prescribes a procedure for conducting a hearing to review an action
129 taken against a provider of services under Medicaid. (NRS 422.306) Section 51.5 of this
130 bill requires such a provider of services to maintain and provide certain documents to
131 the Department for the purpose of verifying claims. Section 51.5 authorizes the
132 Department to deny a claim or recover money already paid if the Department is unable
133 to verify the claim. Section 51.8 of this bill: (1) prescribes a process for the Department
134 to review claims for appropriateness and propriety; and (2) authorizes the Department
135 to deny or recover any amount paid pursuant to such a claim or take certain actions
136 based on such a review. Section 119.5 of this bill makes an appropriation to the Division
137 of Health Care Financing and Policy of the Department and authorizes the expenditure
138 of certain other money to carry out sections 51.3-51.8.
139 Section 67 of this bill: (1) creates the Office of Mental Health within the Department; and
140 (2) requires the Director to appoint the Executive Director of the Office. Section 67.2 of
141 this bill requires the Office to perform certain duties to improve access to and the
142 effectiveness of mental health services in this State. [Section 67 authorizes the Office to
143 request an allocation of money from the Account] Section 67.4 of this bill requires the
144 Office to perform certain additional duties related to the mental and behavioral health
145 of children. Sections 67.6-67.8 of this bill require the subcommittee on the mental health
146 of children of the Commission on Behavioral Health and each mental health consortium
147 to support those duties. Section 67.5 of this bill requires the Office to submit a biennial
148 report to the Legislature. Section 66.6 of this bill defines the term “Office” for the
149 purposes of sections 67-67.5 to refer to the Office of Mental Health. Senate Bill No. 494
150 of this legislative session proposes to create a new department in the Executive Branch of
151 State Government known as the Nevada Health Authority to perform certain duties
152 related to health care, including behavioral health care, in this State. Section 121.5 of
153 this bill transfers the Office to the Nevada Health Authority if Senate Bill No. 494 is
154 enacted.
155 Section 89 of this bill requires the Board of Psychological Examiners to: (1) [provide]
156 take certain actions to incentivize licensees to receive continuing education concerning the
157 mental health needs of patients in rural areas; and (2) establish a program to recognize
158 psychologists who provide at least 200 hours of services through telehealth to such patients.
159 Sections 20, [43, 47,] 46, 50, 75, 85, 109 and 113 of this bill prescribe requirements to
160 expedite the process of credentialing providers of health care to participate in public and
161 private health insurance plans. Beginning on January 1, 2027, sections 117 and 118 of this
162 bill require insurers that issue such plans, or entities to which such insurers delegate
163 credentialing functions, to process least 95 percent of complete requests for such credentialing
164 not later than 60 days after receiving all of the information necessary to complete such a
165 request. Beginning on January 1, 2027, section 21 of this bill similarly requires a hospital to
166 process at least 95 percent of complete requests from providers of health care for privileges to
Senate Amendment No. 942 to Senate Bill No. 495 Page 7
167 perform services at the hospital not later than 60 days after receiving all of the information
168 necessary to complete such a request.
169 Existing law authorizes an emergency medical technician, advanced emergency medical
170 technician or paramedic who holds the proper endorsement to provide services, known as
171 community paramedicine services, to patients who do not require emergency medical
172 transportation. (NRS 450B.1993) Sections 29-31 of this bill authorize paramedics to serve as
173 employees or volunteers in a hospital under certain circumstances and with certain limitations.
174 [Existing law requires the Director of the Office of Science, Innovation and Technology
175 in the Office of the Governor to implement the Graduate Medical Education Grant Program,
176 which is a program to award grants to institutions in this State seeking to create, expand or
177 retain programs for residency training and postdoctoral fellowships for physicians. (NRS
178 223.610, 223.637) Sections 36-40 of this bill transfer duties related to the administration of
179 the Program from the Office of Science, Innovation and Technology to the Department.
180 Sections 34 and 35 of this bill make conforming changes to remove the Program from the
181 duties that the Director of the Office of Science, Innovation and Technology is required to
182 perform. Section 39: (1) authorizes the Department to award limited grants for certain
183 purposes relating to the establishment of a program for residency training and postdoctoral
184 fellowships for physicians; and (2) establishes certain priorities for the awarding of grants.
185 Section 33 of this bill prohibits a grantee from eliminating or reducing the size of a program
186 for residency training and postdoctoral fellowships without the approval of the Department.
187 Section 49 of this bill requires the Department to explore ways to use federal financial
188 participation in Medicaid to support such programs. Section 121 of this bill requires the
189 Patient Protection Commission to conduct a study during the 2025-2026 interim concerning
190 academic medical centers in this State, and section 120 of this bill appropriates money for the
191 study. Section 121 authorizes the Patient Protection Commission to request not more than two
192 legislative measures to implement any recommendations resulting from the study.]
193 Existing law provides that a noncompetition covenant is void unless the covenant: (1) is
194 supported by valuable consideration; (2) does not impose any restraint that is greater than is
195 required for the protection of the employer; (3) does not impose any undue hardship on the
196 employee; and (4) imposes restrictions that are appropriately related to the consideration for
197 the covenant. (NRS 613.195) Section 71 of this bill provides that [, in general, a
198 noncompetition covenant may not restrict a provider of health care from providing care at any
199 location during or after the term of his or her employment or contract. Section 70 of this bill
200 prescribes certain exceptions to that general prohibition.] a noncompetition covenant may
201 not apply to a provider of health care whose primary duties involve providing clinical
202 care to patients and who is not employed or contracted to primarily perform
203 administrative tasks.
204 Sections 74 and 84 of this bill require the Board of Medical Examiners and the State
205 Board of Osteopathic Medicine, respectively, to establish by regulation a procedure for
206 prioritizing applications for licensure as a physician or osteopathic physician of applicants
207 who plan to: (1) serve underserved geographic areas or populations in this State; or (2)
208 practice a specialty for which there is a shortage in this State. Sections 76 and 86 of this bill
209 require certain reports submitted by those Boards to the Governor and Legislature to include
210 information relating to the efficiency of the process for licensing physicians or osteopathic
211 physicians, as applicable.
212 Existing law requires the Director to: (1) develop and make available to each
213 professional licensing board that licenses, certifies or registers providers of health care
214 an electronic data request that solicits certain information relating to the demographics
215 and practices of providers of health care; and (2) establish and maintain a database of
216 information collected through the data request. (NRS 439A.116) Under existing law,
217 providers of health care applying to renew a license, certificate or registration may, but
218 are not required to, complete the data request. (NRS 450B.805, 630.2671, 630A.327,
219 631.332, 632.3423, 633.4716, 634.1303, 634A.169, 635.111, 636.262, 637.145, 637B.192,
220 639.183, 640.152, 640A.185, 640B.405, 640D.135, 640E.225, 641.2215, 641A.217,
221 641B.281, 641C.455, 652.126) Sections 76.5, 82.3, 82.6, 86.2-86.8 and 89.2-89.9 of this bill
222 make completion of the data request mandatory to renew a license, certificate or
223 registration issued by: (1) the Board of Medical Examiners; (2) the Board of Dental
224 Examiners of Nevada; (3) the State Board of Nursing; (4) the State Board of Osteopathic
225 Medicine; (5) the State Board of Podiatry; (6) the Nevada State Board of Optometry; (7)
Senate Amendment No. 942 to Senate Bill No. 495 Page 8
226 the Board of Dispensing Opticians; (8) the Board of Psychological Examiners; (9) the
227 Board of Examiners for Marriage and Family Therapists and Clinical Professional
228 Counselors; (10) the Board of Examiners for Social Workers; (11) the Board of
229 Examiners for Alcohol, Drug and Gambling Counselors; and (12) the Board of Applied
230 Behavior Analysis. Section 42.5 of this bill makes a conforming change to ensure the
231 confidentiality of information submitted through such a data request.
232 Existing law requires an applicant for licensure as a dental hygienist to have graduated
233 from an accredited program of dental hygiene that meets certain requirements. (NRS 631.290)
234 Sections 77 and 79 of this bill [require] authorize the Board of Dental Examiners of Nevada
235 to establish by regulation an alternative training pathway involving a course of training under
236 the supervision of a licensed dentist that an applicant for such a license may complete instead
237 of graduating from such a program. Section 77 requires an applicant who has completed the
238 alternative training pathway to have also successfully passed: (1) a competency examination
239 conducted by the supervising dentist; (2) a written examination; and (3) a clinical examination
240 approved by the Board. Section 78 of this bill requires such an applicant to submit with his or
241 her application for licensure proof that he or she has passed those examinations. Section 77
242 provides that a person who completes the alternative training pathway is only eligible for
243 licensure if he or she began the pathway during a biennium during which there was shortage
244 of dental hygienists, as documented by the assessment conducted pursuant to section 7.
245 Section 77 requires the Board to adopt regulations establishing the scope of practice of a
246 dental hygienist who has completed the alternative training pathway . [, including regulations
247 authorizing such a dental hygienist to: (1) practice at locations in addition to the locations
248 where a dental hygienist is authorized to practice under existing law; and (2) prescribe and
249 dispense] Section 81 of this bill prohibits a dental hygienist who has completed the
250 alternative training pathway and has not subsequently graduated from an accredited
251 program of dental hygiene from prescribing and dispensing preventive agents . [, in
252 addition to the preventive agents that a dental hygienist is authorized to prescribe and dispense
253 under existing law. (NRS 631.310, 631.3105) Sections 32, 80-82, 87 and 88 of this bill make
254 conforming changes to authorize such a dental hygienist to practice at such locations and
255 prescribe and dispense such protective agents.]
256 Existing law requires the Department to administer Medicaid and the Children’s Health
257 Insurance Program. (NRS 422.270) Existing federal law authorizes: (1) a hospital to elect to
258 make determinations concerning whether certain persons are presumptively eligible for
259 Medicaid; and (2) a state to allow certain other entities to make such determinations. (42
260 U.S.C. §§ 1396a(a)(47), 1396r-1, 1396r-1a, 1396r-1b, 1396r-1c) Section 51 of this bill
261 requires the Department to take certain measures to facilitate such presumptive eligibility
262 determinations by the personnel of hospitals and qualified community-based organizations.
263 Section 51 also requires the Department to audit such entities to ensure that the presumptive
264 eligibility determinations made by the personnel of those entities are accurate and comply
265 with applicable law.
266 Existing law authorizes certain health insurers to require prior authorization before an
267 insured may receive coverage for medical and dental care in certain circumstances. If an
268 insurer requires prior authorization, existing law requires the insurer to: (1) file its procedure
269 for obtaining prior authorization with the Commissioner of Insurance for approval; and (2)
270 respond to a request for prior authorization within 20 days after receiving the request. (NRS
271 687B.225) Beginning on January 1, 2028, sections [44,] 47, 53-62, 69, 97-108 and 110 of this
272 bill establish additional requirements relating to the use of prior authorization for medical [and
273 dental] care by health insurers, including Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program
274 and insurance for [public] state employees, as well as certain entities with which such insurers
275 contract to perform functions relating to prior authorization. Sections 53.5, 54, 55 and 98-100
276 define certain terms, and sections 53 and 97 establish the applicability of those definitions.
277 Section 101.6 of this bill requires certain insurers and other entities that employ or
278 utilize an artificial intelligence system or automated decision tool to process requests for
279 prior authorization to transmit a notice to each insured that: (1) discloses the insurer’s
280 use of the system or tool to process requests for prior authorization; and (2) describes
281 certain aspects of the system or tool. Sections 56 and 110 require an insurer or other entity
282 that performs functions relating to prior authorization to respond to a request for prior
283 authorization within [the] a specified period of time . [prescribed by certain nationally
284 recognized operating rules governing prior authorization.] If an insurer or other entity that
Senate Amendment No. 942 to Senate Bill No. 495 Page 9
285 performs functions relating to prior authorization is unable to approve or deny a request for
286 prior authorization within that time period, sections 56 and 110 require the insurer or entity to
287 notify the insured and his or her provider of health care of the delay. Sections 58 and 102
288 prescribe the required contents of that notice. Sections 59 and 103 require an insurer or other
289 entity that performs functions relating to prior authorization to provide similar notice upon
290 denying a request for prior authorization and establish a process to appeal such a denial.
291 Sections 56 and 110 prohibit insurers and other entities that perform functions relating to
292 prior authorization from requiring prior authorization for covered emergency services.
293 Sections 57 and 101 require insurers and other entities that perform functions relating to prior
294 authorization to implement an electronic system for receiving and processing requests for
295 prior authorization. Sections 22 and 72 of this bill require certain medical facilities and
296 providers of health care to submit requests for prior authorization through those systems.
297 Sections 60 and 104 limit the circumstances under which an insurer or other entity that
298 performs functions relating to prior authorization may: (1) revoke the approval of a request for
299 prior authorization; (2) delay or deny payment for care to which such a request pertains; or (3)
300 assign a lower billing code or otherwise reduce the payment for such care. [Section 126 of this
301 bill eliminates certain similar requirements in existing law governing dental insurance that are
302 less stringent than the requirements of section 104.] Sections 61 and 105 prescribe certain
303 requirements to ensure the continuity of care for an insured whose benefits are terminated or
304 who switches health insurance plans. Sections 62 and 106 provide for the reporting and
305 publication of certain information relating to prior authorization and the payment of claims.
306 Section 107 establishes the Gold Card Exemption Program to exempt providers of health care
307 whose requests for prior authorization are approved at a rate of at least 95 percent from the
308 requirement to obtain prior authorization for certain services. Section 56 requires the
309 Department, with respect to Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program, or a
310 Medicaid managed care organization to grant Gold Card Exemptions to providers of health
311 care in accordance with section 107 except in certain circumstances. [Sections 44 and]
312 Section 63 of this bill [require insurance for the employees of local governments,] requires
313 Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program to comply with certain requirements
314 governing the prompt payment of claims that apply under existing law to private insurers and
315 the Public Employees’ Benefits Program. (NRS 683A.0879, 689A.410, 689B.255, 689C.355,
316 689A.188, 695B.2505, 695C.185, 695D.215) Section 63 additionally requires Medicaid to
317 comply with certain federal requirements governing the timely payment of claims under
318 Medicaid. (42 C.F.R. § 447.45(d)(2),(3))
319 Section 108 requires the Commissioner to adopt regulations prescribing: (1) requirements
320 to ensure that applicants for certain certificates or approval to engage in business related to
321 insurance are equipped to comply with certain requirements governing prior authorization and
322 the payment of health claims; and (2) criteria to ensure that an insurer or other entity that
323 enters into a contract to provide services for certain public insurance programs is in
324 compliance with those requirements. Sections 45, [64, 66,] 91, 93-95 [, 115] and 116 of this
325 bill make various changes to establish the applicability of those regulations. Section 92 of this
326 bill makes a conforming change to indicate the proper placement of section 91 in the Nevada
327 Revised Statutes. Section 108 additionally requires the Commissioner to perform certain other
328 duties relating to the implementation and enforcement of requirements governing prior
329 authorization and the payment of health claims. Section 65 of this bill requires the prior
330 authorization policies and procedures for prescription drugs under Medicaid to comply with
331 sections 53-63. Section 41 of this bill requires the Director of the Department to administer
332 sections [49-63] 50-63 in the same manner as other provisions governing Medicaid. Sections
333 [44,] 47, [52,] 69 and 114 of this bill make sections 97-108 and 110 applicable to insurance
334 for [public] state and private employees [, Medicaid managed care organizations] and
335 nonprofit hospital or medical services corporations. Section 101.3 of this bill makes sections
336 101.8-105 and 110 inapplicable to Medicaid managed care organizations, which are
337 instead required to comply with sections 56 and 58-61. Sections [23-27,] 23, 24, 25, 26,
338 27, 90, 111 and 112 of this bill make conforming changes concerning the applicability and
339 enforcement of sections 20-22 and 109.
340 Section 121 of this bill requires the Patient Protection Commission to conduct a
341 study during the 2025-2026 interim concerning academic medical centers in this State,
342 and section 120 of this bill appropriates money for the study.

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Department of Health and Human Services, or the Director of
2 the Department or the divisions thereof, to conduct various programs for the improvement of
3 public health and health care in this State. (NRS 433.702-433.744, 439.4921-439.525,
4 439.529-439.5297, 439.630, 439A.111-439A.185, 439A.200-439A.290, 442.710-442.745,
5 457.230-457.280, 458.025, 458A.090, 458A.100, 458A.110) [Sections 2-18 of this bill
6 establish the Nevada Health Care Workforce and Access Program, which is a competitive
7 funding program managed by the Department to support projects to address critical shortages
8 of providers of health care in this State. Sections 3-5 define certain terms, and section 2
9 establishes the applicability of those definitions. Section 6 creates the Nevada Health Care
10 Workforce and Access Account to hold money to fund the Program. Section 119 of this bill
11 appropriates money into the Account. Section 6 authorizes the Director of the Department to
12 transfer money from the Account to another account for the purpose of obtaining additional
13 federal financial participation under Medicaid.]
14 Section 7 of this bill requires the Director to conduct a biennial assessment of the health
15 care workforce needs of this State, which must identify health care professions and
16 specialties, [populations] types of clinical services and expertise and geographic areas
17 experiencing critical shortages of providers of health care [.] or clinical services or expertise.
18 Section 42 of this bill provides that such an assessment is not a regulation and is therefore not
19 subject to notice-and-comment rulemaking. [Section 9 authorizes a person or entity to apply
20 for funding from the Account to support a project to address those critical shortages. Section 8
21 imposes certain additional requirements for a project to be eligible to receive such funding.
22 Sections 10 and 11 prescribe the process for the Department to review applications and
23 recommend applicants for funding. Section 12 provides for a joint committee consisting of the
24 membership of the Board of Economic Development and the Patient Protection Commission
25 to make the final determination concerning which applicants receive funding.
26 After the joint committee awards funding, section 13 requires the Department to enter
27 into a funding agreement with the recipient of the funding that outlines the terms and
28 conditions of the funding and the responsibilities of the recipient. Section 13 requires a
29 recipient of funding to notify and submit a revised plan to the Department if: (1) the recipient
30 significantly modifies or terminates a funded project; or (2) the amount of money available for
31 a funded project changes. Section 13 authorizes the Department to take certain actions in
32 response to such notice. Section 14 authorizes the Department and the Office of Finance to
33 provide certain oversight of a funded project. Section 15 authorizes the Department to suspend
34 or terminate funding or take certain other actions if it determines that the recipient of the
35 funding has failed to comply with state or federal law or regulations or a funding agreement.
36 Sections 16 and 17 provide for certain reporting concerning the Program, and section 18
37 requires the Department to adopt regulations governing the Program.]
38 Existing law requires the Director to prescribe by regulation a framework for the
39 electronic maintenance, transmittal and exchange of electronic health records,
40 prescriptions, health-related information and electronic signatures and requirements for
41 electronic equivalents of written entries or written approvals. With certain exceptions,
42 existing law requires various entities involved in health care, including persons and
43 facilities that provide health care, to maintain, transmit and exchange health
44 information in accordance with those regulations. (NRS 439.589) Section 3.6 of this bill
45 prohibits those regulations from authorizing such a person or entity to comply with that
46 requirement by connecting with a health information exchange or utilizing any other
47 service that charges a fee for providing electronic health records to such a person or
48 entity or a patient upon request. Section 72.8 of this bill: (1) requires a custodian of

Senate Amendment No. 942 to Senate Bill No. 495 Page 5
49 health care records to furnish electronic health records to a patient or certain other
50 entities upon the request of a patient within 7 business days; and (2) prohibits a
51 custodian of health care records from charging a fee to furnish health care records
52 under such circumstances.
53 Sections 3.3, 72.3 and 126 of this bill limit the health care providers that must
54 maintain, transmit and exchange health information electronically to medical facilities
55 and high-level providers of health care. Section 1 of this bill defines the term “high-level
56 provider of health care” to mean a physician, physician assistant, dentist, advanced
57 practice registered nurse, chiropractic physician, podiatric physician or physical
58 therapist. Section 3.3 additionally exempts from requirements to maintain, transmit and
59 exchange health information electronically high-level providers of health care whose solo
60 or group practices are under a certain size. However, section 3.3 requires such high-level
61 providers of health care to furnish the medical records of a patient electronically to the
62 patient or another person or entity upon request of the patient. Section 4.5 of this bill
63 makes conforming changes to revise the applicability of a provision requiring the
64 Department to notify the licensing board of a provider who fails to comply with
65 requirements governing the electronic maintenance, transmittal and exchange of health
66 information. Section 1.5 of this bill establishes the applicability of the definition set forth
67 in section 1, and sections 43, 45.5, 67.9, 116.3 and 116.7 of this bill make other
68 conforming changes to indicate the proper placement of section 1 in the Nevada Revised
69 Statutes. Section 72.5 of this bill updates internal references changed by section 72.3.
70 Existing law prohibits a person or entity from operating an independent center for
71 emergency medical care without a license issued by the Division of Public and
72 Behavioral Health of the Department. (NRS 449.030) Section 22.5 of this bill requires a
73 facility that is structurally separate from the hospital and provides services for the
74 treatment of a medical emergency, including such a facility that is owned or operated by,
75 or otherwise part of, a hospital, to be licensed as an independent center for emergency
76 medical care. (NRS 449.0151, 449.030) Sections 24.3 and 24.5 of this bill prohibit the
77 Division or the State Board of Health from charging a fee for the issuance of such a
78 license. Section 24.8 of this bill prohibits the Division from issuing a license to operate an
79 independent center for emergency medical care that is located within a 5 mile radius of
80 another independent center for emergency medical care or a hospital with an emergency
81 department. However, section 120.6 of this bill requires the Division to issue a license to
82 certain such independent centers for emergency medical care that are currently licensed
83 or had taken certain steps toward operating by January 1, 2025. Section 26.5 of this bill
84 requires an independent center for emergency medical care to provide urgent care
85 services during all operating hours and imposes certain additional requirements related
86 to the provision of such urgent care, except that section 120.3 of this bill exempts from
87 that requirement independent centers for emergency medical care that are licensed on
88 the date on which this bill is enacted.
89 Existing law establishes programs to increase awareness of information concerning
90 hospitals and surgical centers for ambulatory patients. (NRS 439A.200-439A.290)
91 Section 9.5 of this bill requires the Department to establish a similar program to increase
92 awareness of information concerning independent centers for emergency medical care.
93 Sections 9.5, 10.5, 12.5, 13.5 and 27.3 of this bill provide for the Department to collect
94 certain information on the operations of independent centers for emergency medical
95 care and the outcomes for patients treated by independent centers for emergency
96 medical care. To facilitate such reporting, section 27.3 requires an independent center
97 for emergency medical care to use the same form prescribed by the Director for
98 discharging patients as a hospital is currently required to use. Section 95.5 of this bill
99 makes a conforming change to reflect that independent centers for emergency medical
100 care will be using the same form. Sections 12.5 and 13.5 require the Department to: (1)
101 make certain information concerning independent centers for emergency medical care
102 available upon request; and (2) post certain information concerning independent centers
103 for emergency medical care on an Internet website maintained by the Department.
104 Sections 11.2 and 41.5 of this bill make conforming changes to add references to
105 independent centers for emergency medical care to sections that discuss the program
106 and associated website. Section 8.5 of this bill defines the term “independent center for
107 emergency medical care” for that purpose. Section 11.5 of this bill establishes the

Senate Amendment No. 942 to Senate Bill No. 495 Page 6
108 applicability of certain definitions. Section 27.7 of this bill requires a report prepared by
109 the Director on the status of the programs to increase public awareness of information
110 concerning hospitals and surgical centers for ambulatory patients to additionally include
111 information on the status of the program to increase awareness of information
112 concerning independent centers for emergency medical care. Section 51.3 of this bill
113 requires the Director of the Department, to the extent that money is available, to include
114 under Medicaid a system of value-based payments for care provided by independent
115 centers for emergency medical care to recipients of Medicaid.
116 Existing law authorizes a court, upon a petition, to order the sealing of records of
117 certain convictions if the person who was convicted: (1) has not been convicted of any
118 additional offense, except for minor traffic violations, for a specified period of time; and
119 (2) does not have charges pending for any offense, except for minor traffic violations.
120 (NRS 179.245) Existing law also authorizes a court, upon a petition, to order the sealing
121 of records of an arrest where the charges were dismissed, the prosecutor declined to
122 prosecute or the person who was arrested was acquitted. (NRS 179.255) Section 32.5 of
123 this bill authorizes the Department or the Division of Health Care Financing and Policy
124 of the Department to review certain sealed records for the purpose of determining the
125 suitability of the person to whom the records pertain to serve as a provider of services
126 under Medicaid or to own or serve as an officer, managing employee or managing agent
127 of such a provider of services.
128 Existing law prescribes a procedure for conducting a hearing to review an action
129 taken against a provider of services under Medicaid. (NRS 422.306) Section 51.5 of this
130 bill requires such a provider of services to maintain and provide certain documents to
131 the Department for the purpose of verifying claims. Section 51.5 authorizes the
132 Department to deny a claim or recover money already paid if the Department is unable
133 to verify the claim. Section 51.8 of this bill: (1) prescribes a process for the Department
134 to review claims for appropriateness and propriety; and (2) authorizes the Department
135 to deny or recover any amount paid pursuant to such a claim or take certain actions
136 based on such a review. Section 119.5 of this bill makes an appropriation to the Division
137 of Health Care Financing and Policy of the Department and authorizes the expenditure
138 of certain other money to carry out sections 51.3-51.8.
139 Section 67 of this bill: (1) creates the Office of Mental Health within the Department; and
140 (2) requires the Director to appoint the Executive Director of the Office. Section 67.2 of
141 this bill requires the Office to perform certain duties to improve access to and the
142 effectiveness of mental health services in this State. [Section 67 authorizes the Office to
143 request an allocation of money from the Account] Section 67.4 of this bill requires the
144 Office to perform certain additional duties related to the mental and behavioral health
145 of children. Sections 67.6-67.8 of this bill require the subcommittee on the mental health
146 of children of the Commission on Behavioral Health and each mental health consortium
147 to support those duties. Section 67.5 of this bill requires the Office to submit a biennial
148 report to the Legislature. Section 66.6 of this bill defines the term “Office” for the
149 purposes of sections 67-67.5 to refer to the Office of Mental Health. Senate Bill No. 494
150 of this legislative session proposes to create a new department in the Executive Branch of
151 State Government known as the Nevada Health Authority to perform certain duties
152 related to health care, including behavioral health care, in this State. Section 121.5 of
153 this bill transfers the Office to the Nevada Health Authority if Senate Bill No. 494 is
154 enacted.
155 Section 89 of this bill requires the Board of Psychological Examiners to: (1) [provide]
156 take certain actions to incentivize licensees to receive continuing education concerning the
157 mental health needs of patients in rural areas; and (2) establish a program to recognize
158 psychologists who provide at least 200 hours of services through telehealth to such patients.
159 Sections 20, [43, 47,] 46, 50, 75, 85, 109 and 113 of this bill prescribe requirements to
160 expedite the process of credentialing providers of health care to participate in public and
161 private health insurance plans. Beginning on January 1, 2027, sections 117 and 118 of this
162 bill require insurers that issue such plans, or entities to which such insurers delegate
163 credentialing functions, to process least 95 percent of complete requests for such credentialing
164 not later than 60 days after receiving all of the information necessary to complete such a
165 request. Beginning on January 1, 2027, section 21 of this bill similarly requires a hospital to
166 process at least 95 percent of complete requests from providers of health care for privileges to

Senate Amendment No. 942 to Senate Bill No. 495 Page 7
167 perform services at the hospital not later than 60 days after receiving all of the information
168 necessary to complete such a request.
169 Existing law authorizes an emergency medical technician, advanced emergency medical
170 technician or paramedic who holds the proper endorsement to provide services, known as
171 community paramedicine services, to patients who do not require emergency medical
172 transportation. (NRS 450B.1993) Sections 29-31 of this bill authorize paramedics to serve as
173 employees or volunteers in a hospital under certain circumstances and with certain limitations.
174 [Existing law requires the Director of the Office of Science, Innovation and Technology
175 in the Office of the Governor to implement the Graduate Medical Education Grant Program,
176 which is a program to award grants to institutions in this State seeking to create, expand or
177 retain programs for residency training and postdoctoral fellowships for physicians. (NRS
178 223.610, 223.637) Sections 36-40 of this bill transfer duties related to the administration of
179 the Program from the Office of Science, Innovation and Technology to the Department.
180 Sections 34 and 35 of this bill make conforming changes to remove the Program from the
181 duties that the Director of the Office of Science, Innovation and Technology is required to
182 perform. Section 39: (1) authorizes the Department to award limited grants for certain
183 purposes relating to the establishment of a program for residency training and postdoctoral
184 fellowships for physicians; and (2) establishes certain priorities for the awarding of grants.
185 Section 33 of this bill prohibits a grantee from eliminating or reducing the size of a program
186 for residency training and postdoctoral fellowships without the approval of the Department.
187 Section 49 of this bill requires the Department to explore ways to use federal financial
188 participation in Medicaid to support such programs. Section 121 of this bill requires the
189 Patient Protection Commission to conduct a study during the 2025-2026 interim concerning
190 academic medical centers in this State, and section 120 of this bill appropriates money for the
191 study. Section 121 authorizes the Patient Protection Commission to request not more than two
192 legislative measures to implement any recommendations resulting from the study.]
193 Existing law provides that a noncompetition covenant is void unless the covenant: (1) is
194 supported by valuable consideration; (2) does not impose any restraint that is greater than is
195 required for the protection of the employer; (3) does not impose any undue hardship on the
196 employee; and (4) imposes restrictions that are appropriately related to the consideration for
197 the covenant. (NRS 613.195) Section 71 of this bill provides that [, in general, a
198 noncompetition covenant may not restrict a provider of health care from providing care at any
199 location during or after the term of his or her employment or contract. Section 70 of this bill
200 prescribes certain exceptions to that general prohibition.] a noncompetition covenant may
201 not apply to a provider of health care whose primary duties involve providing clinical
202 care to patients and who is not employed or contracted to primarily perform
203 administrative tasks.
204 Sections 74 and 84 of this bill require the Board of Medical Examiners and the State
205 Board of Osteopathic Medicine, respectively, to establish by regulation a procedure for
206 prioritizing applications for licensure as a physician or osteopathic physician of applicants
207 who plan to: (1) serve underserved geographic areas or populations in this State; or (2)
208 practice a specialty for which there is a shortage in this State. Sections 76 and 86 of this bill
209 require certain reports submitted by those Boards to the Governor and Legislature to include
210 information relating to the efficiency of the process for licensing physicians or osteopathic
211 physicians, as applicable.
212 Existing law requires the Director to: (1) develop and make available to each
213 professional licensing board that licenses, certifies or registers providers of health care
214 an electronic data request that solicits certain information relating to the demographics
215 and practices of providers of health care; and (2) establish and maintain a database of
216 information collected through the data request. (NRS 439A.116) Under existing law,
217 providers of health care applying to renew a license, certificate or registration may, but
218 are not required to, complete the data request. (NRS 450B.805, 630.2671, 630A.327,
219 631.332, 632.3423, 633.4716, 634.1303, 634A.169, 635.111, 636.262, 637.145, 637B.192,
220 639.183, 640.152, 640A.185, 640B.405, 640D.135, 640E.225, 641.2215, 641A.217,
221 641B.281, 641C.455, 652.126) Sections 76.5, 82.3, 82.6, 86.2-86.8 and 89.2-89.9 of this bill
222 make completion of the data request mandatory to renew a license, certificate or
223 registration issued by: (1) the Board of Medical Examiners; (2) the Board of Dental
224 Examiners of Nevada; (3) the State Board of Nursing; (4) the State Board of Osteopathic
225 Medicine; (5) the State Board of Podiatry; (6) the Nevada State Board of Optometry; (7)

Senate Amendment No. 942 to Senate Bill No. 495 Page 8
226 the Board of Dispensing Opticians; (8) the Board of Psychological Examiners; (9) the
227 Board of Examiners for Marriage and Family Therapists and Clinical Professional
228 Counselors; (10) the Board of Examiners for Social Workers; (11) the Board of
229 Examiners for Alcohol, Drug and Gambling Counselors; and (12) the Board of Applied
230 Behavior Analysis. Section 42.5 of this bill makes a conforming change to ensure the
231 confidentiality of information submitted through such a data request.
232 Existing law requires an applicant for licensure as a dental hygienist to have graduated
233 from an accredited program of dental hygiene that meets certain requirements. (NRS 631.290)
234 Sections 77 and 79 of this bill [require] authorize the Board of Dental Examiners of Nevada
235 to establish by regulation an alternative training pathway involving a course of training under
236 the supervision of a licensed dentist that an applicant for such a license may complete instead
237 of graduating from such a program. Section 77 requires an applicant who has completed the
238 alternative training pathway to have also successfully passed: (1) a competency examination
239 conducted by the supervising dentist; (2) a written examination; and (3) a clinical examination
240 approved by the Board. Section 78 of this bill requires such an applicant to submit with his or
241 her application for licensure proof that he or she has passed those examinations. Section 77
242 provides that a person who completes the alternative training pathway is only eligible for
243 licensure if he or she began the pathway during a biennium during which there was shortage
244 of dental hygienists, as documented by the assessment conducted pursuant to section 7.
245 Section 77 requires the Board to adopt regulations establishing the scope of practice of a
246 dental hygienist who has completed the alternative training pathway . [, including regulations
247 authorizing such a dental hygienist to: (1) practice at locations in addition to the locations
248 where a dental hygienist is authorized to practice under existing law; and (2) prescribe and
249 dispense] Section 81 of this bill prohibits a dental hygienist who has completed the
250 alternative training pathway and has not subsequently graduated from an accredited
251 program of dental hygiene from prescribing and dispensing preventive agents . [, in
252 addition to the preventive agents that a dental hygienist is authorized to prescribe and dispense
253 under existing law. (NRS 631.310, 631.3105) Sections 32, 80-82, 87 and 88 of this bill make
254 conforming changes to authorize such a dental hygienist to practice at such locations and
255 prescribe and dispense such protective agents.]
256 Existing law requires the Department to administer Medicaid and the Children’s Health
257 Insurance Program. (NRS 422.270) Existing federal law authorizes: (1) a hospital to elect to
258 make determinations concerning whether certain persons are presumptively eligible for
259 Medicaid; and (2) a state to allow certain other entities to make such determinations. (42
260 U.S.C. §§ 1396a(a)(47), 1396r-1, 1396r-1a, 1396r-1b, 1396r-1c) Section 51 of this bill
261 requires the Department to take certain measures to facilitate such presumptive eligibility
262 determinations by the personnel of hospitals and qualified community-based organizations.
263 Section 51 also requires the Department to audit such entities to ensure that the presumptive
264 eligibility determinations made by the personnel of those entities are accurate and comply
265 with applicable law.
266 Existing law authorizes certain health insurers to require prior authorization before an
267 insured may receive coverage for medical and dental care in certain circumstances. If an
268 insurer requires prior authorization, existing law requires the insurer to: (1) file its procedure
269 for obtaining prior authorization with the Commissioner of Insurance for approval; and (2)
270 respond to a request for prior authorization within 20 days after receiving the request. (NRS
271 687B.225) Beginning on January 1, 2028, sections [44,] 47, 53-62, 69, 97-108 and 110 of this
272 bill establish additional requirements relating to the use of prior authorization for medical [and
273 dental] care by health insurers, including Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program
274 and insurance for [public] state employees, as well as certain entities with which such insurers
275 contract to perform functions relating to prior authorization. Sections 53.5, 54, 55 and 98-100
276 define certain terms, and sections 53 and 97 establish the applicability of those definitions.
277 Section 101.6 of this bill requires certain insurers and other entities that employ or
278 utilize an artificial intelligence system or automated decision tool to process requests for
279 prior authorization to transmit a notice to each insured that: (1) discloses the insurer’s
280 use of the system or tool to process requests for prior authorization; and (2) describes
281 certain aspects of the system or tool. Sections 56 and 110 require an insurer or other entity
282 that performs functions relating to prior authorization to respond to a request for prior
283 authorization within [the] a specified period of time . [prescribed by certain nationally
284 recognized operating rules governing prior authorization.] If an insurer or other entity that

Senate Amendment No. 942 to Senate Bill No. 495 Page 9
285 performs functions relating to prior authorization is unable to approve or deny a request for
286 prior authorization within that time period, sections 56 and 110 require the insurer or entity to
287 notify the insured and his or her provider of health care of the delay. Sections 58 and 102
288 prescribe the required contents of that notice. Sections 59 and 103 require an insurer or other
289 entity that performs functions relating to prior authorization to provide similar notice upon
290 denying a request for prior authorization and establish a process to appeal such a denial.
291 Sections 56 and 110 prohibit insurers and other entities that perform functions relating to
292 prior authorization from requiring prior authorization for covered emergency services.
293 Sections 57 and 101 require insurers and other entities that perform functions relating to prior
294 authorization to implement an electronic system for receiving and processing requests for
295 prior authorization. Sections 22 and 72 of this bill require certain medical facilities and
296 providers of health care to submit requests for prior authorization through those systems.
297 Sections 60 and 104 limit the circumstances under which an insurer or other entity that
298 performs functions relating to prior authorization may: (1) revoke the approval of a request for
299 prior authorization; (2) delay or deny payment for care to which such a request pertains; or (3)
300 assign a lower billing code or otherwise reduce the payment for such care. [Section 126 of this
301 bill eliminates certain similar requirements in existing law governing dental insurance that are
302 less stringent than the requirements of section 104.] Sections 61 and 105 prescribe certain
303 requirements to ensure the continuity of care for an insured whose benefits are terminated or
304 who switches health insurance plans. Sections 62 and 106 provide for the reporting and
305 publication of certain information relating to prior authorization and the payment of claims.
306 Section 107 establishes the Gold Card Exemption Program to exempt providers of health care
307 whose requests for prior authorization are approved at a rate of at least 95 percent from the
308 requirement to obtain prior authorization for certain services. Section 56 requires the
309 Department, with respect to Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program, or a
310 Medicaid managed care organization to grant Gold Card Exemptions to providers of health
311 care in accordance with section 107 except in certain circumstances. [Sections 44 and]
312 Section 63 of this bill [require insurance for the employees of local governments,] requires
313 Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program to comply with certain requirements
314 governing the prompt payment of claims that apply under existing law to private insurers and
315 the Public Employees’ Benefits Program. (NRS 683A.0879, 689A.410, 689B.255, 689C.355,
316 689A.188, 695B.2505, 695C.185, 695D.215) Section 63 additionally requires Medicaid to
317 comply with certain federal requirements governing the timely payment of claims under
318 Medicaid. (42 C.F.R. § 447.45(d)(2),(3))
319 Section 108 requires the Commissioner to adopt regulations prescribing: (1) requirements
320 to ensure that applicants for certain certificates or approval to engage in business related to
321 insurance are equipped to comply with certain requirements governing prior authorization and
322 the payment of health claims; and (2) criteria to ensure that an insurer or other entity that
323 enters into a contract to provide services for certain public insurance programs is in
324 compliance with those requirements. Sections 45, [64, 66,] 91, 93-95 [, 115] and 116 of this
325 bill make various changes to establish the applicability of those regulations. Section 92 of this
326 bill makes a conforming change to indicate the proper placement of section 91 in the Nevada
327 Revised Statutes. Section 108 additionally requires the Commissioner to perform certain other
328 duties relating to the implementation and enforcement of requirements governing prior
329 authorization and the payment of health claims. Section 65 of this bill requires the prior
330 authorization policies and procedures for prescription drugs under Medicaid to comply with
331 sections 53-63. Section 41 of this bill requires the Director of the Department to administer
332 sections [49-63] 50-63 in the same manner as other provisions governing Medicaid. Sections
333 [44,] 47, [52,] 69 and 114 of this bill make sections 97-108 and 110 applicable to insurance
334 for [public] state and private employees [, Medicaid managed care organizations] and
335 nonprofit hospital or medical services corporations. Section 101.3 of this bill makes sections
336 101.8-105 and 110 inapplicable to Medicaid managed care organizations, which are
337 instead required to comply with sections 56 and 58-61. Sections [23-27,] 23, 24, 25, 26,
338 27, 90, 111 and 112 of this bill make conforming changes concerning the applicability and
339 enforcement of sections 20-22 and 109.
340 Section 121 of this bill requires the Patient Protection Commission to conduct a
341 study during the 2025-2026 interim concerning academic medical centers in this State,
342 and section 120 of this bill appropriates money for the study.

29 compensation to which a trustee is entitled, the difference must be paid by the
30 trustee.
31 3. In any county in which a legal services organization exists, the governing
32 body of the county, or of any school district, municipal corporation, political

695D.2153 Claims: Organization for dental care or administrator prohibited
from denying claim for which prior authorization has been granted; exceptions.
1. An organization for dental care or an administrator of a dental plan shall
not refuse to pay a claim for dental care for which the organization for dental care
or administrator, as applicable, has granted prior authorization unless:
(a) A limitation on coverage provided under the applicable plan for dental care,
including, without limitation, a limitation on total costs or frequency of services:
(1) Did not apply at the time the prior authorization was granted; and
(2) Applied at the time of the provision of the dental care for which the
prior authorization was granted because additional covered dental care was
provided to the member after the prior authorization was granted and before the
provision of the dental care for which prior authorization was granted;
(b) The documentation provided by the person submitting the claim clearly
fails to support the claim for which prior authorization was originally granted;
(c) After the prior authorization was granted, additional dental care was
provided to the member or the condition of the member otherwise changed such
that:
(1) The dental care for which prior authorization was granted is no longer
medically necessary; or
(2) The organization for dental care or administrator, as applicable, would
be required to deny prior authorization under the terms and conditions of the
applicable plan for dental care that were in effect at the time of the provision of the
dental care for which prior authorization was granted;
(d) Another person or entity is responsible for the payment;
(e) The dentist has previously been paid for the procedures covered by the
claim;
(f) The claim was fraudulent or the prior authorization was based, in whole or
in part, on materially false information provided by the dentist or member or
another person who is not affiliated with the organization for dental care or
administrator, as applicable; or
(g) The member was not eligible to receive the dental care for which the claim
was made on the date that the dental care was provided.
2. Any provision of a contract that conflicts with this section is against public
policy, void and unenforceable.
3. As used in this section:
(a) “Medically necessary” means dental care that a prudent dentist would
provide to a patient to prevent, diagnose or treat an illness, injury or disease, or any
symptoms thereof, that is necessary and:
(1) Provided in accordance with generally accepted standards of dental
practice;
(2) Clinically appropriate with regard to type, frequency, extent, location
and duration;
(3) Not primarily provided for the convenience of the patient or dentist;

Senate Amendment No. 942 to Senate Bill No. 495 Page 115
(4) Required to improve a specific dental condition of a patient or to
preserve the existing state of oral health of the patient; and
(5) The most clinically appropriate level of dental care that may be safely
provided to the patient.
(b) “Prior authorization” means any communication issued by an organization
for dental care or the administrator of a dental plan in response to a request by a
dentist in the form prescribed by the organization for dental care or administrator,
as applicable, which indicates that specific dental care provided to a patient is:
