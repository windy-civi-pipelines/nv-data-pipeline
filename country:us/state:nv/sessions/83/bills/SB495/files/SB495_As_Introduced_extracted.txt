Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Department of Health and Human Services, or the
2 Director of the Department or the divisions thereof, to conduct various programs
3 for the improvement of public health and health care in this State. (NRS 433.702-
4 433.744, 439.4921-439.525, 439.529-439.5297, 439.630, 439A.111-439A.185,
5 439A.200-439A.290, 442.710-442.745, 457.230-457.280, 458.025, 458A.090,
6 458A.100, 458A.110) Sections 2-18 of this bill establish the Nevada Health Care
7 Workforce and Access Program, which is a competitive funding program managed
8 by the Department to support projects to address critical shortages of providers of
9 health care in this State. Sections 3-5 define certain terms, and section 2 establishes
10 the applicability of those definitions. Section 6 creates the Nevada Health Care
11 Workforce and Access Account to hold money to fund the Program. Section 119 of
12 this bill appropriates money into the Account. Section 6 authorizes the Director of
13 the Department to transfer money from the Account to another account for the
14 purpose of obtaining additional federal financial participation under Medicaid.
15 Section 7 requires the Director to conduct a biennial assessment of the health
16 care workforce needs of this State, which must identify health care specialties,
17 populations and geographic areas experiencing critical shortages of providers of
18 health care. Section 42 of this bill provides that such an assessment is not a
19 regulation and is therefore not subject to notice-and-comment rulemaking. Section
20 9 authorizes a person or entity to apply for funding from the Account to support a
21 project to address those critical shortages. Section 8 imposes certain additional
22 requirements for a project to be eligible to receive such funding. Sections 10 and
23 11 prescribe the process for the Department to review applications and recommend
24 applicants for funding. Section 12 provides for a joint committee consisting of the
25 membership of the Board of Economic Development and the Patient Protection
26 Commission to make the final determination concerning which applicants receive
27 funding.
28 After the joint committee awards funding, section 13 requires the Department
29 to enter into a funding agreement with the recipient of the funding that outlines the
30 terms and conditions of the funding and the responsibilities of the recipient. Section
31 13 requires a recipient of funding to notify and submit a revised plan to the
32 Department if: (1) the recipient significantly modifies or terminates a funded
33 project; or (2) the amount of money available for a funded project changes. Section
34 13 authorizes the Department to take certain actions in response to such notice.
35 Section 14 authorizes the Department and the Office of Finance to provide certain
36 oversight of a funded project. Section 15 authorizes the Department to suspend or
37 terminate funding or take certain other actions if it determines that the recipient of
38 the funding has failed to comply with state or federal law or regulations or a
39 funding agreement. Sections 16 and 17 provide for certain reporting concerning
-
*SB495*
– 3 –
40 the Program, and section 18 requires the Department to adopt regulations
41 governing the Program.
42 Section 67 of this bill: (1) creates the Office of Mental Health within the
43 Department; and (2) requires the Office to perform certain duties to improve access
44 to and the effectiveness of mental health services in this State. Section 67
45 authorizes the Office to request an allocation of money from the Account to support
46 those duties. Section 89 of this bill requires the Board of Psychological Examiners
47 to: (1) provide continuing education concerning the mental health needs of patients
48 in rural areas; and (2) establish a program to recognize psychologists who provide
49 at least 200 hours of services through telehealth to such patients.
50 Sections 20, 43, 47, 50, 75, 85, 109 and 113 of this bill prescribe requirements
51 to expedite the process of credentialing providers of health care to participate in
52 public and private health insurance plans. Beginning on January 1, 2027, sections
53 117 and 118 of this bill require insurers that issue such plans, or entities to which
54 such insurers delegate credentialing functions, to process least 95 percent of
55 complete requests for such credentialing not later than 60 days after receiving all of
56 the information necessary to complete such a request. Beginning on January 1,
57 2027, section 21 of this bill similarly requires a hospital to process at least 95
58 percent of complete requests from providers of health care for privileges to perform
59 services at the hospital not later than 60 days after receiving all of the information
60 necessary to complete such a request.
61 Existing law authorizes an emergency medical technician, advanced emergency
62 medical technician or paramedic who holds the proper endorsement to provide
63 services, known as community paramedicine services, to patients who do not
64 require emergency medical transportation. (NRS 450B.1993) Sections 29-31 of this
65 bill authorize paramedics to serve as employees or volunteers in a hospital under
66 certain circumstances and with certain limitations.
67 Existing law requires the Director of the Office of Science, Innovation and
68 Technology in the Office of the Governor to implement the Graduate Medical
69 Education Grant Program, which is a program to award grants to institutions in this
70 State seeking to create, expand or retain programs for residency training and
71 postdoctoral fellowships for physicians. (NRS 223.610, 223.637) Sections 36-40 of
72 this bill transfer duties related to the administration of the Program from the Office
73 of Science, Innovation and Technology to the Department. Sections 34 and 35 of
74 this bill make conforming changes to remove the Program from the duties that the
75 Director of the Office of Science, Innovation and Technology is required to
76 perform. Section 39: (1) authorizes the Department to award limited grants for
77 certain purposes relating to the establishment of a program for residency training
78 and postdoctoral fellowships for physicians; and (2) establishes certain priorities for
79 the awarding of grants. Section 33 of this bill prohibits a grantee from eliminating
80 or reducing the size of a program for residency training and postdoctoral
81 fellowships without the approval of the Department. Section 49 of this bill requires
82 the Department to explore ways to use federal financial participation in Medicaid to
83 support such programs. Section 121 of this bill requires the Patient Protection
84 Commission to conduct a study during the 2025-2026 interim concerning academic
85 medical centers in this State, and section 120 of this bill appropriates money for the
86 study. Section 121 authorizes the Patient Protection Commission to request not
87 more than two legislative measures to implement any recommendations resulting
88 from the study.
89 Existing law provides that a noncompetition covenant is void unless the
90 covenant: (1) is supported by valuable consideration; (2) does not impose any
91 restraint that is greater than is required for the protection of the employer; (3) does
92 not impose any undue hardship on the employee; and (4) imposes restrictions that
93 are appropriately related to the consideration for the covenant. (NRS 613.195)
94 Section 71 of this bill provides that, in general, a noncompetition covenant may not
-
*SB495*
– 4 –
95 restrict a provider of health care from providing care at any location during or after
96 the term of his or her employment or contract. Section 70 of this bill prescribes
97 certain exceptions to that general prohibition.
98 Sections 74 and 84 of this bill require the Board of Medical Examiners and the
99 State Board of Osteopathic Medicine, respectively, to establish by regulation a
100 procedure for prioritizing applications for licensure as a physician or osteopathic
101 physician of applicants who plan to: (1) serve underserved geographic areas or
102 populations in this State; or (2) practice a specialty for which there is a shortage in
103 this State. Sections 76 and 86 of this bill require certain reports submitted by those
104 Boards to the Governor and Legislature to include information relating to the
105 efficiency of the process for licensing physicians or osteopathic physicians, as
106 applicable.
107 Existing law requires an applicant for licensure as a dental hygienist to have
108 graduated from an accredited program of dental hygiene that meets certain
109 requirements. (NRS 631.290) Sections 77 and 79 of this bill require the Board of
110 Dental Examiners of Nevada to establish by regulation an alternative training
111 pathway involving a course of training under the supervision of a licensed dentist
112 that an applicant for such a license may complete instead of graduating from such a
113 program. Section 77 requires an applicant who has completed the alternative
114 training pathway to have also successfully passed: (1) a competency examination
115 conducted by the supervising dentist; (2) a written examination; and (3) a clinical
116 examination approved by the Board. Section 78 of this bill requires such an
117 applicant to submit with his or her application for licensure proof that he or she has
118 passed those examinations. Section 77 provides that a person who completes the
119 alternative training pathway is only eligible for licensure if he or she began the
120 pathway during a biennium during which there was shortage of dental hygienists, as
121 documented by the assessment conducted pursuant to section 7. Section 77
122 requires the Board to adopt regulations establishing the scope of practice of a dental
123 hygienist who has completed the alternative training pathway, including regulations
124 authorizing such a dental hygienist to: (1) practice at locations in addition to the
125 locations where a dental hygienist is authorized to practice under existing law; and
126 (2) prescribe and dispense preventive agents, in addition to the preventive agents
127 that a dental hygienist is authorized to prescribe and dispense under existing law.
128 (NRS 631.310, 631.3105) Sections 32, 80-82, 87 and 88 of this bill make
129 conforming changes to authorize such a dental hygienist to practice at such
130 locations and prescribe and dispense such protective agents.
131 Existing law requires the Department to administer Medicaid and the
132 Children’s Health Insurance Program. (NRS 422.270) Existing federal law
133 authorizes: (1) a hospital to elect to make determinations concerning whether
134 certain persons are presumptively eligible for Medicaid; and (2) a state to allow
135 certain other entities to make such determinations. (42 U.S.C. §§ 1396a(a)(47),
136 1396r-1, 1396r-1a, 1396r-1b, 1396r-1c) Section 51 of this bill requires the
137 Department to take certain measures to facilitate such presumptive eligibility
138 determinations by the personnel of hospitals and qualified community-based
139 organizations. Section 51 also requires the Department to audit such entities to
140 ensure that the presumptive eligibility determinations made by the personnel of
141 those entities are accurate and comply with applicable law.
142 Existing law authorizes certain health insurers to require prior authorization
143 before an insured may receive coverage for medical and dental care in certain
144 circumstances. If an insurer requires prior authorization, existing law requires the
145 insurer to: (1) file its procedure for obtaining prior authorization with the
146 Commissioner of Insurance for approval; and (2) respond to a request for prior
147 authorization within 20 days after receiving the request. (NRS 687B.225)
148 Beginning on January 1, 2028, sections 44, 47, 53-62, 69, 97-108 and 110 of this
149 bill establish additional requirements relating to the use of prior authorization for
-
*SB495*
– 5 –
150 medical and dental care by health insurers, including Medicaid, the Children’s
151 Health Insurance Program and insurance for public employees, as well as certain
152 entities with which such insurers contract to perform functions relating to prior
153 authorization. Sections 54, 55 and 98-100 define certain terms, and sections 53
154 and 97 establish the applicability of those definitions. Sections 56 and 110 require
155 an insurer or other entity that performs functions relating to prior authorization to
156 respond to a request for prior authorization within the period of time prescribed by
157 certain nationally recognized operating rules governing prior authorization. If an
158 insurer or other entity that performs functions relating to prior authorization is
159 unable to approve or deny a request for prior authorization within that time period,
160 sections 56 and 110 require the insurer or entity to notify the insured and his or her
161 provider of health care of the delay. Sections 58 and 102 prescribe the required
162 contents of that notice. Sections 59 and 103 require an insurer or other entity that
163 performs functions relating to prior authorization to provide similar notice upon
164 denying a request for prior authorization and establish a process to appeal such a
165 denial.
166 Sections 56 and 110 prohibit insurers and other entities that perform functions
167 relating to prior authorization from requiring prior authorization for covered
168 emergency services. Sections 57 and 101 require insurers and other entities that
169 perform functions relating to prior authorization to implement an electronic system
170 for receiving and processing requests for prior authorization. Sections 22 and 72 of
171 this bill require certain medical facilities and providers of health care to submit
172 requests for prior authorization through those systems.
173 Sections 60 and 104 limit the circumstances under which an insurer or other
174 entity that performs functions relating to prior authorization may: (1) revoke the
175 approval of a request for prior authorization; (2) delay or deny payment for care to
176 which such a request pertains; or (3) assign a lower billing code or otherwise
177 reduce the payment for such care. Section 126 of this bill eliminates certain similar
178 requirements in existing law governing dental insurance that are less stringent than
179 the requirements of section 104. Sections 61 and 105 prescribe certain
180 requirements to ensure the continuity of care for an insured whose benefits are
181 terminated or who switches health insurance plans. Sections 62 and 106 provide
182 for the reporting and publication of certain information relating to prior
183 authorization and the payment of claims. Section 107 establishes the Gold Card
184 Exemption Program to exempt providers of health care whose requests for prior
185 authorization are approved at a rate of at least 95 percent from the requirement to
186 obtain prior authorization for certain services. Section 56 requires the Department,
187 with respect to Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program, or a
188 Medicaid managed care organization to grant Gold Card Exemptions to providers
189 of health care in accordance with section 107 except in certain circumstances.
190 Sections 44 and 63 of this bill require insurance for the employees of local
191 governments, Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program to comply
192 with certain requirements governing the prompt payment of claims that apply under
193 existing law to private insurers and the Public Employees’ Benefits Program. (NRS
194 683A.0879, 689A.410, 689B.255, 689C.355, 689A.188, 695B.2505, 695C.185,
195 695D.215) Section 63 additionally requires Medicaid to comply with certain
196 federal requirements governing the timely payment of claims under Medicaid. (42
197 C.F.R. § 447.45(d)(2),(3))
198 Section 108 requires the Commissioner to adopt regulations prescribing: (1)
199 requirements to ensure that applicants for certain certificates or approval to engage
200 in business related to insurance are equipped to comply with certain requirements
201 governing prior authorization and the payment of health claims; and (2) criteria to
202 ensure that an insurer or other entity that enters into a contract to provide services
203 for certain public insurance programs is in compliance with those requirements.
204 Sections 45, 64, 66, 91, 93-95, 115 and 116 of this bill make various changes to
-
*SB495*
– 6 –
205 establish the applicability of those regulations. Section 92 of this bill makes a
206 conforming change to indicate the proper placement of section 91 in the Nevada
207 Revised Statutes. Section 108 additionally requires the Commissioner to perform
208 certain other duties relating to the implementation and enforcement of requirements
209 governing prior authorization and the payment of health claims. Section 65 of this
210 bill requires the prior authorization policies and procedures for prescription drugs
211 under Medicaid to comply with sections 53-63. Section 41 of this bill requires the
212 Director of the Department to administer sections 49-63 in the same manner as
213 other provisions governing Medicaid. Sections 44, 47, 52, 69 and 114 of this bill
214 make sections 97-108 and 110 applicable to insurance for public and private
215 employees, Medicaid managed care organizations and nonprofit hospital or medical
216 services corporations. Sections 23-27, 90, 111 and 112 of this bill make
217 conforming changes concerning the applicability and enforcement of sections 20-
218 22 and 109.

2 (b) Does not impose any restraint that is greater than is required
3 for the protection of the employer for whose benefit the restraint is
4 imposed;
5 (c) Does not impose any undue hardship on the employee; and
6 (d) Imposes restrictions that are appropriate in relation to the
7 valuable consideration supporting the noncompetition covenant.
8 2. A noncompetition covenant may not restrict, and an

11 if:

13 client;
14 (b) The customer or client voluntarily chose to leave and seek
15 services from the former employee; and
16 (c) The former employee is otherwise complying with the

35 attempts to enforce a noncompetition covenant that is void and
36 unenforceable under this section does not violate the provisions of
37 NRS 613.200.
38 [5.] 6. If the termination of the employment of an employee is
39 the result of a reduction of force, reorganization or similar
40 restructuring of the employer, a noncompetition covenant is only
41 enforceable during the period in which the employer is paying the
42 employee’s salary, benefits or equivalent compensation, including,
43 without limitation, severance pay.
44 [6.] 7. If an employer brings an action to enforce a
45 noncompetition covenant or an employee brings an action to
-
*SB495*
– 57 –
1 challenge a noncompetition covenant and the court finds the
2 covenant is supported by valuable consideration but contains
3 limitations as to time, geographical area or scope of activity to be
4 restrained that are not reasonable, imposes a greater restraint than is
5 necessary for the protection of the employer for whose benefit the
6 restraint is imposed or imposes undue hardship on the employee, the
7 court shall revise the covenant to the extent necessary and enforce
8 the covenant as revised. Such revisions must cause the limitations
9 contained in the covenant as to time, geographical area and scope of
10 activity to be restrained to be reasonable, to not impose undue
11 hardship on the employee and to impose a restraint that is not
12 greater than is necessary for the protection of the employer for
13 whose benefit the restraint is imposed.

15 noncompetition covenant or an employee brings an action to
16 challenge a noncompetition covenant and the court finds that the
17 noncompetition covenant applies to an employee described in
18 subsection 3 or that the employer has restricted or attempted to
19 restrict a former employee in the manner described in subsection 2,
20 the court shall award the employee reasonable attorney’s fees and

23 pursuant to NRS 18.010.

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Department of Health and Human Services, or the
2 Director of the Department or the divisions thereof, to conduct various programs
3 for the improvement of public health and health care in this State. (NRS 433.702-
4 433.744, 439.4921-439.525, 439.529-439.5297, 439.630, 439A.111-439A.185,
5 439A.200-439A.290, 442.710-442.745, 457.230-457.280, 458.025, 458A.090,
6 458A.100, 458A.110) Sections 2-18 of this bill establish the Nevada Health Care
7 Workforce and Access Program, which is a competitive funding program managed
8 by the Department to support projects to address critical shortages of providers of
9 health care in this State. Sections 3-5 define certain terms, and section 2 establishes
10 the applicability of those definitions. Section 6 creates the Nevada Health Care
11 Workforce and Access Account to hold money to fund the Program. Section 119 of
12 this bill appropriates money into the Account. Section 6 authorizes the Director of
13 the Department to transfer money from the Account to another account for the
14 purpose of obtaining additional federal financial participation under Medicaid.
15 Section 7 requires the Director to conduct a biennial assessment of the health
16 care workforce needs of this State, which must identify health care specialties,
17 populations and geographic areas experiencing critical shortages of providers of
18 health care. Section 42 of this bill provides that such an assessment is not a
19 regulation and is therefore not subject to notice-and-comment rulemaking. Section
20 9 authorizes a person or entity to apply for funding from the Account to support a
21 project to address those critical shortages. Section 8 imposes certain additional
22 requirements for a project to be eligible to receive such funding. Sections 10 and
23 11 prescribe the process for the Department to review applications and recommend
24 applicants for funding. Section 12 provides for a joint committee consisting of the
25 membership of the Board of Economic Development and the Patient Protection
26 Commission to make the final determination concerning which applicants receive
27 funding.
28 After the joint committee awards funding, section 13 requires the Department
29 to enter into a funding agreement with the recipient of the funding that outlines the
30 terms and conditions of the funding and the responsibilities of the recipient. Section
31 13 requires a recipient of funding to notify and submit a revised plan to the
32 Department if: (1) the recipient significantly modifies or terminates a funded
33 project; or (2) the amount of money available for a funded project changes. Section
34 13 authorizes the Department to take certain actions in response to such notice.
35 Section 14 authorizes the Department and the Office of Finance to provide certain
36 oversight of a funded project. Section 15 authorizes the Department to suspend or
37 terminate funding or take certain other actions if it determines that the recipient of
38 the funding has failed to comply with state or federal law or regulations or a
39 funding agreement. Sections 16 and 17 provide for certain reporting concerning
-
*SB495*

– 3 –
40 the Program, and section 18 requires the Department to adopt regulations
41 governing the Program.
42 Section 67 of this bill: (1) creates the Office of Mental Health within the
43 Department; and (2) requires the Office to perform certain duties to improve access
44 to and the effectiveness of mental health services in this State. Section 67
45 authorizes the Office to request an allocation of money from the Account to support
46 those duties. Section 89 of this bill requires the Board of Psychological Examiners
47 to: (1) provide continuing education concerning the mental health needs of patients
48 in rural areas; and (2) establish a program to recognize psychologists who provide
49 at least 200 hours of services through telehealth to such patients.
50 Sections 20, 43, 47, 50, 75, 85, 109 and 113 of this bill prescribe requirements
51 to expedite the process of credentialing providers of health care to participate in
52 public and private health insurance plans. Beginning on January 1, 2027, sections
53 117 and 118 of this bill require insurers that issue such plans, or entities to which
54 such insurers delegate credentialing functions, to process least 95 percent of
55 complete requests for such credentialing not later than 60 days after receiving all of
56 the information necessary to complete such a request. Beginning on January 1,
57 2027, section 21 of this bill similarly requires a hospital to process at least 95
58 percent of complete requests from providers of health care for privileges to perform
59 services at the hospital not later than 60 days after receiving all of the information
60 necessary to complete such a request.
61 Existing law authorizes an emergency medical technician, advanced emergency
62 medical technician or paramedic who holds the proper endorsement to provide
63 services, known as community paramedicine services, to patients who do not
64 require emergency medical transportation. (NRS 450B.1993) Sections 29-31 of this
65 bill authorize paramedics to serve as employees or volunteers in a hospital under
66 certain circumstances and with certain limitations.
67 Existing law requires the Director of the Office of Science, Innovation and
68 Technology in the Office of the Governor to implement the Graduate Medical
69 Education Grant Program, which is a program to award grants to institutions in this
70 State seeking to create, expand or retain programs for residency training and
71 postdoctoral fellowships for physicians. (NRS 223.610, 223.637) Sections 36-40 of
72 this bill transfer duties related to the administration of the Program from the Office
73 of Science, Innovation and Technology to the Department. Sections 34 and 35 of
74 this bill make conforming changes to remove the Program from the duties that the
75 Director of the Office of Science, Innovation and Technology is required to
76 perform. Section 39: (1) authorizes the Department to award limited grants for
77 certain purposes relating to the establishment of a program for residency training
78 and postdoctoral fellowships for physicians; and (2) establishes certain priorities for
79 the awarding of grants. Section 33 of this bill prohibits a grantee from eliminating
80 or reducing the size of a program for residency training and postdoctoral
81 fellowships without the approval of the Department. Section 49 of this bill requires
82 the Department to explore ways to use federal financial participation in Medicaid to
83 support such programs. Section 121 of this bill requires the Patient Protection
84 Commission to conduct a study during the 2025-2026 interim concerning academic
85 medical centers in this State, and section 120 of this bill appropriates money for the
86 study. Section 121 authorizes the Patient Protection Commission to request not
87 more than two legislative measures to implement any recommendations resulting
88 from the study.
89 Existing law provides that a noncompetition covenant is void unless the
90 covenant: (1) is supported by valuable consideration; (2) does not impose any
91 restraint that is greater than is required for the protection of the employer; (3) does
92 not impose any undue hardship on the employee; and (4) imposes restrictions that
93 are appropriately related to the consideration for the covenant. (NRS 613.195)
94 Section 71 of this bill provides that, in general, a noncompetition covenant may not
-
*SB495*

– 4 –
95 restrict a provider of health care from providing care at any location during or after
96 the term of his or her employment or contract. Section 70 of this bill prescribes
97 certain exceptions to that general prohibition.
98 Sections 74 and 84 of this bill require the Board of Medical Examiners and the
99 State Board of Osteopathic Medicine, respectively, to establish by regulation a
100 procedure for prioritizing applications for licensure as a physician or osteopathic
101 physician of applicants who plan to: (1) serve underserved geographic areas or
102 populations in this State; or (2) practice a specialty for which there is a shortage in
103 this State. Sections 76 and 86 of this bill require certain reports submitted by those
104 Boards to the Governor and Legislature to include information relating to the
105 efficiency of the process for licensing physicians or osteopathic physicians, as
106 applicable.
107 Existing law requires an applicant for licensure as a dental hygienist to have
108 graduated from an accredited program of dental hygiene that meets certain
109 requirements. (NRS 631.290) Sections 77 and 79 of this bill require the Board of
110 Dental Examiners of Nevada to establish by regulation an alternative training
111 pathway involving a course of training under the supervision of a licensed dentist
112 that an applicant for such a license may complete instead of graduating from such a
113 program. Section 77 requires an applicant who has completed the alternative
114 training pathway to have also successfully passed: (1) a competency examination
115 conducted by the supervising dentist; (2) a written examination; and (3) a clinical
116 examination approved by the Board. Section 78 of this bill requires such an
117 applicant to submit with his or her application for licensure proof that he or she has
118 passed those examinations. Section 77 provides that a person who completes the
119 alternative training pathway is only eligible for licensure if he or she began the
120 pathway during a biennium during which there was shortage of dental hygienists, as
121 documented by the assessment conducted pursuant to section 7. Section 77
122 requires the Board to adopt regulations establishing the scope of practice of a dental
123 hygienist who has completed the alternative training pathway, including regulations
124 authorizing such a dental hygienist to: (1) practice at locations in addition to the
125 locations where a dental hygienist is authorized to practice under existing law; and
126 (2) prescribe and dispense preventive agents, in addition to the preventive agents
127 that a dental hygienist is authorized to prescribe and dispense under existing law.
128 (NRS 631.310, 631.3105) Sections 32, 80-82, 87 and 88 of this bill make
129 conforming changes to authorize such a dental hygienist to practice at such
130 locations and prescribe and dispense such protective agents.
131 Existing law requires the Department to administer Medicaid and the
132 Children’s Health Insurance Program. (NRS 422.270) Existing federal law
133 authorizes: (1) a hospital to elect to make determinations concerning whether
134 certain persons are presumptively eligible for Medicaid; and (2) a state to allow
135 certain other entities to make such determinations. (42 U.S.C. §§ 1396a(a)(47),
136 1396r-1, 1396r-1a, 1396r-1b, 1396r-1c) Section 51 of this bill requires the
137 Department to take certain measures to facilitate such presumptive eligibility
138 determinations by the personnel of hospitals and qualified community-based
139 organizations. Section 51 also requires the Department to audit such entities to
140 ensure that the presumptive eligibility determinations made by the personnel of
141 those entities are accurate and comply with applicable law.
142 Existing law authorizes certain health insurers to require prior authorization
143 before an insured may receive coverage for medical and dental care in certain
144 circumstances. If an insurer requires prior authorization, existing law requires the
145 insurer to: (1) file its procedure for obtaining prior authorization with the
146 Commissioner of Insurance for approval; and (2) respond to a request for prior
147 authorization within 20 days after receiving the request. (NRS 687B.225)
148 Beginning on January 1, 2028, sections 44, 47, 53-62, 69, 97-108 and 110 of this
149 bill establish additional requirements relating to the use of prior authorization for
-
*SB495*

– 5 –
150 medical and dental care by health insurers, including Medicaid, the Children’s
151 Health Insurance Program and insurance for public employees, as well as certain
152 entities with which such insurers contract to perform functions relating to prior
153 authorization. Sections 54, 55 and 98-100 define certain terms, and sections 53
154 and 97 establish the applicability of those definitions. Sections 56 and 110 require
155 an insurer or other entity that performs functions relating to prior authorization to
156 respond to a request for prior authorization within the period of time prescribed by
157 certain nationally recognized operating rules governing prior authorization. If an
158 insurer or other entity that performs functions relating to prior authorization is
159 unable to approve or deny a request for prior authorization within that time period,
160 sections 56 and 110 require the insurer or entity to notify the insured and his or her
161 provider of health care of the delay. Sections 58 and 102 prescribe the required
162 contents of that notice. Sections 59 and 103 require an insurer or other entity that
163 performs functions relating to prior authorization to provide similar notice upon
164 denying a request for prior authorization and establish a process to appeal such a
165 denial.
166 Sections 56 and 110 prohibit insurers and other entities that perform functions
167 relating to prior authorization from requiring prior authorization for covered
168 emergency services. Sections 57 and 101 require insurers and other entities that
169 perform functions relating to prior authorization to implement an electronic system
170 for receiving and processing requests for prior authorization. Sections 22 and 72 of
171 this bill require certain medical facilities and providers of health care to submit
172 requests for prior authorization through those systems.
173 Sections 60 and 104 limit the circumstances under which an insurer or other
174 entity that performs functions relating to prior authorization may: (1) revoke the
175 approval of a request for prior authorization; (2) delay or deny payment for care to
176 which such a request pertains; or (3) assign a lower billing code or otherwise
177 reduce the payment for such care. Section 126 of this bill eliminates certain similar
178 requirements in existing law governing dental insurance that are less stringent than
179 the requirements of section 104. Sections 61 and 105 prescribe certain
180 requirements to ensure the continuity of care for an insured whose benefits are
181 terminated or who switches health insurance plans. Sections 62 and 106 provide
182 for the reporting and publication of certain information relating to prior
183 authorization and the payment of claims. Section 107 establishes the Gold Card
184 Exemption Program to exempt providers of health care whose requests for prior
185 authorization are approved at a rate of at least 95 percent from the requirement to
186 obtain prior authorization for certain services. Section 56 requires the Department,
187 with respect to Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program, or a
188 Medicaid managed care organization to grant Gold Card Exemptions to providers
189 of health care in accordance with section 107 except in certain circumstances.
190 Sections 44 and 63 of this bill require insurance for the employees of local
191 governments, Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program to comply
192 with certain requirements governing the prompt payment of claims that apply under
193 existing law to private insurers and the Public Employees’ Benefits Program. (NRS
194 683A.0879, 689A.410, 689B.255, 689C.355, 689A.188, 695B.2505, 695C.185,
195 695D.215) Section 63 additionally requires Medicaid to comply with certain
196 federal requirements governing the timely payment of claims under Medicaid. (42
197 C.F.R. § 447.45(d)(2),(3))
198 Section 108 requires the Commissioner to adopt regulations prescribing: (1)
199 requirements to ensure that applicants for certain certificates or approval to engage
200 in business related to insurance are equipped to comply with certain requirements
201 governing prior authorization and the payment of health claims; and (2) criteria to
202 ensure that an insurer or other entity that enters into a contract to provide services
203 for certain public insurance programs is in compliance with those requirements.
204 Sections 45, 64, 66, 91, 93-95, 115 and 116 of this bill make various changes to

– 6 –
205 establish the applicability of those regulations. Section 92 of this bill makes a
206 conforming change to indicate the proper placement of section 91 in the Nevada
207 Revised Statutes. Section 108 additionally requires the Commissioner to perform
208 certain other duties relating to the implementation and enforcement of requirements
209 governing prior authorization and the payment of health claims. Section 65 of this
210 bill requires the prior authorization policies and procedures for prescription drugs
211 under Medicaid to comply with sections 53-63. Section 41 of this bill requires the
212 Director of the Department to administer sections 49-63 in the same manner as
213 other provisions governing Medicaid. Sections 44, 47, 52, 69 and 114 of this bill
214 make sections 97-108 and 110 applicable to insurance for public and private
215 employees, Medicaid managed care organizations and nonprofit hospital or medical
216 services corporations. Sections 23-27, 90, 111 and 112 of this bill make
217 conforming changes concerning the applicability and enforcement of sections 20-
218 22 and 109.

43 Sec. 71. NRS 613.195 is hereby amended to read as follows:

2 (b) Does not impose any restraint that is greater than is required
3 for the protection of the employer for whose benefit the restraint is
4 imposed;

15 services from the former employee; and
16 (c) The former employee is otherwise complying with the

18 of activity to be restrained, other than any limitation on providing
19 services to a former customer or client who seeks the services of the

21 employee.
22  Any provision in a noncompetition covenant which violates the
23 provisions of this subsection is void and unenforceable.
24 3. A noncompetition covenant may not apply to an employee

35 attempts to enforce a noncompetition covenant that is void and
36 unenforceable under this section does not violate the provisions of
37 NRS 613.200.
38 [5.] 6. If the termination of the employment of an employee is
39 the result of a reduction of force, reorganization or similar
40 restructuring of the employer, a noncompetition covenant is only
41 enforceable during the period in which the employer is paying the
42 employee’s salary, benefits or equivalent compensation, including,

44 [6.] 7. If an employer brings an action to enforce a
45 noncompetition covenant or an employee brings an action to
-
*SB495*

– 57 –
1 challenge a noncompetition covenant and the court finds the
2 covenant is supported by valuable consideration but contains
3 limitations as to time, geographical area or scope of activity to be
4 restrained that are not reasonable, imposes a greater restraint than is
5 necessary for the protection of the employer for whose benefit the
6 restraint is imposed or imposes undue hardship on the employee, the
7 court shall revise the covenant to the extent necessary and enforce
8 the covenant as revised. Such revisions must cause the limitations
9 contained in the covenant as to time, geographical area and scope of
10 activity to be restrained to be reasonable, to not impose undue
11 hardship on the employee and to impose a restraint that is not
12 greater than is necessary for the protection of the employer for
13 whose benefit the restraint is imposed.
14 [7.] 8. If an employer brings an action to enforce a
15 noncompetition covenant or an employee brings an action to
16 challenge a noncompetition covenant and the court finds that the
17 noncompetition covenant applies to an employee described in
18 subsection 3 or that the employer has restricted or attempted to
19 restrict a former employee in the manner described in subsection 2,
20 the court shall award the employee reasonable attorney’s fees and
21 costs. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as prohibiting a
22 court from otherwise awarding attorney’s fees to a prevailing party
23 pursuant to NRS 18.010.

25 (a) “Employer” means every person having control or custody of
