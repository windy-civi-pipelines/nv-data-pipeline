Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Department of Taxation to regulate and collect a tax
2 on cigarettes and other tobacco products and distinguishes alternative nicotine
3 products and vapor products from other tobacco products for such purposes.
4 (Chapter 370 of NRS) Existing law also requires: (1) manufacturers of tobacco
5 products whose cigarettes are sold in this State to execute and deliver a certification
6 to the Attorney General; and (2) the Department to create and maintain a directory
7 of all manufacturers that have executed and delivered such certifications. (NRS
8 370.665, 370.675)
9 Section 6 of this bill similarly requires manufacturers of vapor products to
10 execute and deliver a certification to the Attorney General. Section 7 of this bill
11 requires such a manufacturer to notify the Attorney General not later than 30 days
12 after any material change to the certification. Section 8 of this bill requires the
13 Attorney General to create and maintain a directory of all manufacturers of vapor
14 products that have executed and delivered a certification indicating compliance
15 with federal marketing authorization requirements. Section 9 of this bill requires
16 the Attorney General to provide a manufacturer of vapor products notice and an
17 opportunity to cure any deficiency before removing the manufacturer or any vapor
18 products from the directory. Section 10 of this bill prohibits vapor products that are
19 not included in the directory, on or after the date the Attorney General first makes
20 the directory available for public inspection, from being sold in this State or to a
21 consumer in this State. Sections 11 and 12 of this bill require nonresident and
22 foreign manufacturers of vapor products to appoint an agent in this State for service
23 of process and to submit a bond payable to the State, respectively.
24 Section 13 of this bill provides for annual unannounced compliance checks on
25 each retailer, distributor and wholesaler that sells or distributes vapor products in
26 this State. Section 14 of this bill provides civil penalties for selling or offering for
27 sale any vapor product not included in the directory. Section 15 of this bill requires
28 the Attorney General to prepare and submit to the Legislature an annual report
29 regarding the directory and section 16 of this bill requires the Attorney General to
30 adopt regulations to carry out the provisions of sections 2-16 of this bill.
31 Sections 3, 4 and 5 define certain terms for purposes of implementing the
32 provisions of this bill, including “vapor product,” which is defined for such
33 purposes to mean any noncombustible product containing nicotine.
34 Section 17 of this bill authorizes the seizure of any cigarette, product
35 containing, made or derived from tobacco, vapor product, alternative nicotine
36 product or product containing, made or derived from nicotine sold by a person
37 without a license. Section 18 of this bill prohibits a person from selling, giving,
38 delivering or furnishing to a person a nicotine analogue and defines the term
39 “nicotine analogue” for such purposes. Section 19 of this bill authorizes the seizure
40 of such products if sold, distributed or offered for sale to a person under the age of
41 21 years. Section 20 of this bill authorizes the Department of Taxation to share
42 information obtained in investigations with federal, state or local agencies for
43 purposes of enforcement of corresponding laws of other states. Section 21 of this
44 bill exempts certain information provided in a certification executed and delivered
45 pursuant to section 6 from the requirement that public records and public books be
46 open to inspection.

4 operate to relieve, release or discharge the surety from liability
5 already accrued or which accrues before the expiration of the 60-
6 day period. The Attorney General shall, upon receiving any such
7 request, notify the manufacturer who furnished the bond. Unless
8 the manufacturer, on or before the expiration of the 60-day
9 period, files with the Attorney General a new bond, with the surety
10 approved by and acceptable to the Attorney General, the Attorney
11 General shall remove the manufacturer and its vapor products
12 from the directory.
13 Sec. 13. Each retailer, distributor and wholesaler that sells
14 or distributes vapor products in this State is subject to at least two
15 unannounced compliance checks annually for purposes of

37 or intermediaries is subject to a civil penalty of $10,000 for each
38 individual vapor product offered for sale in violation of this
39 section. In addition, any manufacturer that falsely represents any
40 information required by a certification pursuant to section 6 of
41 this act is guilty of a misdemeanor for each false representation.
42 3. In an action to enforce the provisions of sections 2 to 16,

12 substance, and whether the substance has been manufactured,
13 formulated, sold, distributed or marketed with the intent to avoid
14 the provisions of this chapter or other any applicable provision of
15 law.
16 Sec. 19. NRS 370.521 is hereby amended to read as follows:

42 system to verify that the person is 21 years of age or older. A person

1 diminish or affect in any other manner the rights of a person in any
2 written book or record which is copyrighted pursuant to federal law.
3 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record
4 which is copyrighted solely because it is copyrighted.
5 3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a
6 public book or record shall not deny a request made pursuant to
7 subsection 1 to inspect or copy or receive a copy of a public book or
8 record on the basis that the requested public book or record contains
9 information that is confidential if the governmental entity can
10 redact, delete, conceal or separate, including, without limitation,
11 electronically, the confidential information from the information
12 included in the public book or record that is not otherwise
13 confidential.
14 4. If requested, a governmental entity shall provide a copy of a
15 public record in an electronic format by means of an electronic
16 medium. Nothing in this subsection requires a governmental entity
17 to provide a copy of a public record in an electronic format or by
18 means of an electronic medium if:
19 (a) The public record:
20 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
21 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
22 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by
23 means of an electronic medium would:
24 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
25 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential
26 and that cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from
27 information that is not otherwise confidential.
28 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who
29 has legal custody or control of a public record:
30 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the
31 medium that is requested because the officer, employee or agent has
32 already prepared or would prefer to provide the copy in a different
33 medium.
34 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon
35 request, prepare the copy of the public record and shall not require
36 the person who has requested the copy to prepare the copy himself
37 or herself.
38 Sec. 22. The provisions of subsection 1 of NRS 218D.380 do
39 not apply to any provision of this act which adds or revises a
40 requirement to submit a report to the Legislature.
41 Sec. 23. This act becomes effective upon passage and
42 approval.
