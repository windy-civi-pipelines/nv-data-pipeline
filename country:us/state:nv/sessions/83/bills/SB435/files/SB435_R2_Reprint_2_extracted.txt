Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Department of Taxation to regulate and collect a tax
2 on cigarettes and other tobacco products and distinguishes alternative nicotine
3 products and vapor products from other tobacco products for such purposes.
4 (Chapter 370 of NRS) Existing law also requires: (1) manufacturers of tobacco
5 products whose cigarettes are sold in this State to execute and deliver a certification
6 to the Attorney General; and (2) the Department to create and maintain a directory
7 of all manufacturers that have executed and delivered such certifications. (NRS
8 370.665, 370.675)
9 Section 6 of this bill similarly requires manufacturers of vapor products to
10 execute and deliver a certification to the Attorney General. Section 7 of this bill
11 requires such a manufacturer to notify the Attorney General not later than 30 days
12 after any material change to the certification. Section 8 of this bill requires the
13 Department to create and maintain a directory of all manufacturers of vapor
14 products that have executed and delivered a certification indicating compliance
15 with federal marketing authorization requirements. Section 9 of this bill requires
16 the Department to provide a manufacturer of vapor products notice and an
17 opportunity to cure any violation or deficiency before removing the manufacturer
18 or any vapor products from the directory. Section 9 prohibits a wholesale dealer
19 from purchasing vapor products that have been removed from the directory and
20 requires a retail dealer or wholesale dealer who receives notice of the removal of a
21 product or manufacturer from the directory to take certain actions. Section 10 of
22 this bill prohibits vapor products that are not included in the directory, on or after
23 the date the Department first makes the directory available for public inspection,
24 from being sold in this State or to a consumer in this State. Sections 11 and 12 of
25 this bill require nonresident and foreign manufacturers of vapor products to appoint
26 an agent in this State for service of process and to submit a bond payable to the
27 State, respectively.
28 Section 13 of this bill provides for annual unannounced compliance checks on
29 each retailer, distributor and wholesaler that sells or distributes vapor products in
30 this State. Section 14 of this bill provides civil penalties for selling or offering for
31 sale any vapor product not included in the directory. Section 14.5 of this bill
32 creates the Account for Vapor Product Enforcement in the State General Fund.
33 Section 15 of this bill requires the Department to prepare and submit to the
34 Legislature an annual report regarding the directory and section 16 of this bill
35 requires the Department to adopt regulations to carry out the provisions of sections
36 2-16 of this bill.
37 Sections 3, 4 and 5 define certain terms for purposes of implementing the
38 provisions of this bill, including “vapor product,” which is defined for such
39 purposes to mean any noncombustible product containing nicotine.
40 Section 17 of this bill authorizes the seizure of any cigarette, product
41 containing, made or derived from tobacco, vapor product, alternative nicotine
42 product or product containing, made or derived from nicotine sold by a person
43 without a license. Section 18 of this bill prohibits a person from selling, giving,
44 delivering or furnishing to a person a nicotine analogue and defines the term
45 “nicotine analogue” for such purposes. Section 19.5 of this bill authorizes the
46 seizure of nicotine analogue products under certain circumstances. Section 20 of
47 this bill authorizes the Department to share information obtained in investigations
48 with federal, state or local agencies for purposes of enforcement of corresponding
-

– 3 –
49 laws of other states. Section 21 of this bill exempts certain information provided in
50 a certification executed and delivered pursuant to section 6 from the requirement
51 that public records and public books be open to inspection. Section 21.5 of this bill
52 makes an appropriation to the Office of the Attorney General for the purposes of
53 carrying out the provisions of sections 2-16.

1 Sec. 12. 1. Any nonresident or foreign manufacturer of

29 request, notify the manufacturer who furnished the bond. Unless
30 the manufacturer, on or before the expiration of the 60-day
31 period, files with the Attorney General a new bond, with the surety
32 approved by and acceptable to the Attorney General, the Attorney
33 General shall remove the manufacturer and its vapor products
34 from the directory.
35 Sec. 13. Each retailer, distributor and wholesaler that sells
36 or distributes vapor products in this State is subject to at least two

15 2. A manufacturer whose vapor products are not listed in the
16 directory and who causes the products that are not listed to be sold
17 for retail sale in this State, whether directly or indirectly through
18 an importer, distributor, wholesaler, retailer or similar
19 intermediary or intermediaries is subject to a civil penalty of
20 $10,000 for each individual vapor product offered for sale in
21 violation of this section. In addition, any manufacturer that falsely
22 represents any information required by a certification pursuant to
23 section 6 of this act is guilty of a misdemeanor for each false
24 representation.
25 3. In an action to enforce the provisions of sections 2 to 16,
26 inclusive, of this act, the State is entitled to recover costs,
27 including the costs of investigation, expert witness fees and
28 reasonable attorney’s fees.

25 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
26 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
27 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by
28 means of an electronic medium would:
29 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
30 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential
31 and that cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from
32 information that is not otherwise confidential.
33 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who
34 has legal custody or control of a public record:
35 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the
36 medium that is requested because the officer, employee or agent has
37 already prepared or would prefer to provide the copy in a different
38 medium.
39 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon
40 request, prepare the copy of the public record and shall not require

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Department of Taxation to regulate and collect a tax
2 on cigarettes and other tobacco products and distinguishes alternative nicotine
3 products and vapor products from other tobacco products for such purposes.
4 (Chapter 370 of NRS) Existing law also requires: (1) manufacturers of tobacco
5 products whose cigarettes are sold in this State to execute and deliver a certification
6 to the Attorney General; and (2) the Department to create and maintain a directory
7 of all manufacturers that have executed and delivered such certifications. (NRS
8 370.665, 370.675)
9 Section 6 of this bill similarly requires manufacturers of vapor products to
10 execute and deliver a certification to the Attorney General. Section 7 of this bill
11 requires such a manufacturer to notify the Attorney General not later than 30 days
12 after any material change to the certification. Section 8 of this bill requires the
13 Department to create and maintain a directory of all manufacturers of vapor
14 products that have executed and delivered a certification indicating compliance
15 with federal marketing authorization requirements. Section 9 of this bill requires
16 the Department to provide a manufacturer of vapor products notice and an
17 opportunity to cure any violation or deficiency before removing the manufacturer
18 or any vapor products from the directory. Section 9 prohibits a wholesale dealer
19 from purchasing vapor products that have been removed from the directory and
20 requires a retail dealer or wholesale dealer who receives notice of the removal of a
21 product or manufacturer from the directory to take certain actions. Section 10 of
22 this bill prohibits vapor products that are not included in the directory, on or after
23 the date the Department first makes the directory available for public inspection,
24 from being sold in this State or to a consumer in this State. Sections 11 and 12 of
25 this bill require nonresident and foreign manufacturers of vapor products to appoint
26 an agent in this State for service of process and to submit a bond payable to the
27 State, respectively.
28 Section 13 of this bill provides for annual unannounced compliance checks on
29 each retailer, distributor and wholesaler that sells or distributes vapor products in
30 this State. Section 14 of this bill provides civil penalties for selling or offering for
31 sale any vapor product not included in the directory. Section 14.5 of this bill
32 creates the Account for Vapor Product Enforcement in the State General Fund.
33 Section 15 of this bill requires the Department to prepare and submit to the
34 Legislature an annual report regarding the directory and section 16 of this bill
35 requires the Department to adopt regulations to carry out the provisions of sections
36 2-16 of this bill.
37 Sections 3, 4 and 5 define certain terms for purposes of implementing the
38 provisions of this bill, including “vapor product,” which is defined for such
39 purposes to mean any noncombustible product containing nicotine.
40 Section 17 of this bill authorizes the seizure of any cigarette, product
41 containing, made or derived from tobacco, vapor product, alternative nicotine
42 product or product containing, made or derived from nicotine sold by a person
43 without a license. Section 18 of this bill prohibits a person from selling, giving,
44 delivering or furnishing to a person a nicotine analogue and defines the term
45 “nicotine analogue” for such purposes. Section 19.5 of this bill authorizes the
46 seizure of nicotine analogue products under certain circumstances. Section 20 of
47 this bill authorizes the Department to share information obtained in investigations
48 with federal, state or local agencies for purposes of enforcement of corresponding
-
*SB435_R2*

– 3 –
49 laws of other states. Section 21 of this bill exempts certain information provided in
50 a certification executed and delivered pursuant to section 6 from the requirement
51 that public records and public books be open to inspection. Section 21.5 of this bill
52 makes an appropriation to the Office of the Attorney General for the purposes of
53 carrying out the provisions of sections 2-16.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 370 of NRS is hereby amended by adding

25 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
26 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
27 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by

31 and that cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from
32 information that is not otherwise confidential.
33 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who
34 has legal custody or control of a public record:

37 already prepared or would prefer to provide the copy in a different
38 medium.
39 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon
40 request, prepare the copy of the public record and shall not require
