State to execute and deliver certain information to the Attorney
General; requiring the [Attorney General] Department of Taxation to

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Department of Taxation to regulate and collect a tax on
2 cigarettes and other tobacco products and distinguishes alternative nicotine products and
3 vapor products from other tobacco products for such purposes. (Chapter 370 of NRS) Existing
4 law also requires: (1) manufacturers of tobacco products whose cigarettes are sold in this State
5 to execute and deliver a certification to the Attorney General; and (2) the Department to create
Senate Amendment No. 367 to Senate Bill No. 435 Page 4
6 and maintain a directory of all manufacturers that have executed and delivered such
7 certifications. (NRS 370.665, 370.675)
8 Section 6 of this bill similarly requires manufacturers of vapor products to execute and
9 deliver a certification to the Attorney General. Section 7 of this bill requires such a
10 manufacturer to notify the Attorney General not later than 30 days after any material change
11 to the certification. Section 8 of this bill requires the [Attorney General] Department to
12 create and maintain a directory of all manufacturers of vapor products that have executed and
13 delivered a certification indicating compliance with federal marketing authorization
14 requirements. Section 9 of this bill requires the [Attorney General] Department to provide a
15 manufacturer of vapor products notice and an opportunity to cure any violation or deficiency
16 before removing the manufacturer or any vapor products from the directory. Section 9
17 prohibits a wholesale dealer from purchasing vapor products that have been removed
18 from the directory and requires a retail dealer or wholesale dealer who receives notice of
19 the removal of a product or manufacturer from the directory to take certain actions.
20 Section 10 of this bill prohibits vapor products that are not included in the directory, on or
21 after the date the [Attorney General] Department first makes the directory available for
22 public inspection, from being sold in this State or to a consumer in this State. Sections 11 and
23 12 of this bill require nonresident and foreign manufacturers of vapor products to appoint an
24 agent in this State for service of process and to submit a bond payable to the State,
25 respectively.
26 Section 13 of this bill provides for annual unannounced compliance checks on each
27 retailer, distributor and wholesaler that sells or distributes vapor products in this State. Section
28 14 of this bill provides civil penalties for selling or offering for sale any vapor product not
29 included in the directory. Section 15 of this bill requires the [Attorney General] Department
30 to prepare and submit to the Legislature an annual report regarding the directory and section
31 16 of this bill requires the [Attorney General] Department to adopt regulations to carry out
32 the provisions of sections 2-16 of this bill.
33 Sections 3, 4 and 5 define certain terms for purposes of implementing the provisions of
34 this bill, including “vapor product,” which is defined for such purposes to mean any
35 noncombustible product containing nicotine.
36 Section 17 of this bill authorizes the seizure of any cigarette, product containing, made or
37 derived from tobacco, vapor product, alternative nicotine product or product containing, made
38 or derived from nicotine sold by a person without a license. Section 18 of this bill prohibits a
39 person from selling, giving, delivering or furnishing to a person a nicotine analogue and
40 defines the term “nicotine analogue” for such purposes. [Section 19 of this bill authorizes the
41 seizure of such products if sold, distributed or offered for sale to a person under the age of 21
42 years.] Section 20 of this bill authorizes the Department [of Taxation] to share information
43 obtained in investigations with federal, state or local agencies for purposes of enforcement of
44 corresponding laws of other states. Section 21 of this bill exempts certain information
45 provided in a certification executed and delivered pursuant to section 6 from the requirement
46 that public records and public books be open to inspection.

38 710.159, 711.600, and section 6 of this act, sections 35, 38 and 41 of chapter 478,
39 Statutes of Nevada 2011 and section 2 of chapter 391, Statutes of Nevada 2013 and
40 unless otherwise declared by law to be confidential, all public books and public
41 records of a governmental entity must be open at all times during office hours to
42 inspection by any person, and may be fully copied or an abstract or memorandum
43 may be prepared from those public books and public records. Any such copies,
44 abstracts or memoranda may be used to supply the general public with copies,
45 abstracts or memoranda of the records or may be used in any other way to the
46 advantage of the governmental entity or of the general public. This section does not
47 supersede or in any manner affect the federal laws governing copyrights or enlarge,
48 diminish or affect in any other manner the rights of a person in any written book or
49 record which is copyrighted pursuant to federal law.
50 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record which is
51 copyrighted solely because it is copyrighted.
52 3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a public book or
53 record shall not deny a request made pursuant to subsection 1 to inspect or copy or
Senate Amendment No. 367 to Senate Bill No. 435 Page 17
1 receive a copy of a public book or record on the basis that the requested public
2 book or record contains information that is confidential if the governmental entity
3 can redact, delete, conceal or separate, including, without limitation, electronically,
4 the confidential information from the information included in the public book or
5 record that is not otherwise confidential.
6 4. If requested, a governmental entity shall provide a copy of a public record
7 in an electronic format by means of an electronic medium. Nothing in this
8 subsection requires a governmental entity to provide a copy of a public record in an
9 electronic format or by means of an electronic medium if:
10 (a) The public record:
11 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
12 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
13 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by means of an
14 electronic medium would:
15 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
16 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential and that
17 cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from information that is not
18 otherwise confidential.
19 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who has legal
20 custody or control of a public record:
21 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the medium that
22 is requested because the officer, employee or agent has already prepared or would
23 prefer to provide the copy in a different medium.
24 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon request, prepare
25 the copy of the public record and shall not require the person who has requested the
26 copy to prepare the copy himself or herself.
27 Sec. 22. The provisions of subsection 1 of NRS 218D.380 do not apply to
28 any provision of this act which adds or revises a requirement to submit a report to
29 the Legislature.
30 Sec. 23. This act becomes effective [upon passage and approval.] on
31 January 1, 2026.

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to nicotine products; defining certain terms relating to vapor
products containing nicotine; requiring a manufacturer of a vapor
product that is sold for retail sale in this State or to a consumer in this
State to execute and deliver certain information to the Attorney
General; requiring the [Attorney General] Department of Taxation to
create, maintain and make available a directory of manufacturers of
vapor products and all vapor products; prohibiting a manufacturer of a
vapor product from offering for sale or selling a vapor product that is
not included in the directory; requiring the [Attorney General]
Department to prepare and submit to the Legislature an annual report
regarding the directory; providing for the seizure of certain products
containing nicotine under certain circumstances; making it unlawful to
sell, give, deliver or furnish a product that contains a nicotine
analogue; authorizing the sharing of certain information with federal,
state, or local agencies for purposes of enforcement of certain
provisions relating to products containing nicotine; providing penalties;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Department of Taxation to regulate and collect a tax on
2 cigarettes and other tobacco products and distinguishes alternative nicotine products and
3 vapor products from other tobacco products for such purposes. (Chapter 370 of NRS) Existing
4 law also requires: (1) manufacturers of tobacco products whose cigarettes are sold in this State
5 to execute and deliver a certification to the Attorney General; and (2) the Department to create

Senate Amendment No. 367 to Senate Bill No. 435 Page 4
6 and maintain a directory of all manufacturers that have executed and delivered such
7 certifications. (NRS 370.665, 370.675)
8 Section 6 of this bill similarly requires manufacturers of vapor products to execute and
9 deliver a certification to the Attorney General. Section 7 of this bill requires such a
10 manufacturer to notify the Attorney General not later than 30 days after any material change
11 to the certification. Section 8 of this bill requires the [Attorney General] Department to
12 create and maintain a directory of all manufacturers of vapor products that have executed and
13 delivered a certification indicating compliance with federal marketing authorization
14 requirements. Section 9 of this bill requires the [Attorney General] Department to provide a
15 manufacturer of vapor products notice and an opportunity to cure any violation or deficiency
16 before removing the manufacturer or any vapor products from the directory. Section 9
17 prohibits a wholesale dealer from purchasing vapor products that have been removed
18 from the directory and requires a retail dealer or wholesale dealer who receives notice of
19 the removal of a product or manufacturer from the directory to take certain actions.
20 Section 10 of this bill prohibits vapor products that are not included in the directory, on or
21 after the date the [Attorney General] Department first makes the directory available for
22 public inspection, from being sold in this State or to a consumer in this State. Sections 11 and
23 12 of this bill require nonresident and foreign manufacturers of vapor products to appoint an
24 agent in this State for service of process and to submit a bond payable to the State,
25 respectively.
26 Section 13 of this bill provides for annual unannounced compliance checks on each

39 Statutes of Nevada 2011 and section 2 of chapter 391, Statutes of Nevada 2013 and
40 unless otherwise declared by law to be confidential, all public books and public
41 records of a governmental entity must be open at all times during office hours to
42 inspection by any person, and may be fully copied or an abstract or memorandum
43 may be prepared from those public books and public records. Any such copies,
44 abstracts or memoranda may be used to supply the general public with copies,
45 abstracts or memoranda of the records or may be used in any other way to the
46 advantage of the governmental entity or of the general public. This section does not
47 supersede or in any manner affect the federal laws governing copyrights or enlarge,
48 diminish or affect in any other manner the rights of a person in any written book or
49 record which is copyrighted pursuant to federal law.
50 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record which is
51 copyrighted solely because it is copyrighted.
52 3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a public book or
53 record shall not deny a request made pursuant to subsection 1 to inspect or copy or

Senate Amendment No. 367 to Senate Bill No. 435 Page 17
1 receive a copy of a public book or record on the basis that the requested public
2 book or record contains information that is confidential if the governmental entity
3 can redact, delete, conceal or separate, including, without limitation, electronically,
4 the confidential information from the information included in the public book or
5 record that is not otherwise confidential.
6 4. If requested, a governmental entity shall provide a copy of a public record
7 in an electronic format by means of an electronic medium. Nothing in this
8 subsection requires a governmental entity to provide a copy of a public record in an
9 electronic format or by means of an electronic medium if:
10 (a) The public record:
11 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
12 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
13 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by means of an
14 electronic medium would:
15 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
16 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential and that
17 cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from information that is not
18 otherwise confidential.
19 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who has legal
20 custody or control of a public record:
21 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the medium that
22 is requested because the officer, employee or agent has already prepared or would
23 prefer to provide the copy in a different medium.
24 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon request, prepare
25 the copy of the public record and shall not require the person who has requested the
26 copy to prepare the copy himself or herself.
27 Sec. 22. The provisions of subsection 1 of NRS 218D.380 do not apply to
28 any provision of this act which adds or revises a requirement to submit a report to
29 the Legislature.
30 Sec. 23. This act becomes effective [upon passage and approval.] on
31 January 1, 2026.
