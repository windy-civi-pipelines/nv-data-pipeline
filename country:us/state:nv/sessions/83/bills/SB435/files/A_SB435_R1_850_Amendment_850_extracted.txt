Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Department of Taxation to regulate and collect a tax on
2 cigarettes and other tobacco products and distinguishes alternative nicotine products and
3 vapor products from other tobacco products for such purposes. (Chapter 370 of NRS) Existing
4 law also requires: (1) manufacturers of tobacco products whose cigarettes are sold in this State
Senate Amendment No. 850 to Senate Bill No. 435 First Reprint Page 4
5 to execute and deliver a certification to the Attorney General; and (2) the Department to create
6 and maintain a directory of all manufacturers that have executed and delivered such
7 certifications. (NRS 370.665, 370.675)
8 Section 6 of this bill similarly requires manufacturers of vapor products to execute and
9 deliver a certification to the Attorney General. Section 7 of this bill requires such a
10 manufacturer to notify the Attorney General not later than 30 days after any material change
11 to the certification. Section 8 of this bill requires the Department to create and maintain a
12 directory of all manufacturers of vapor products that have executed and delivered a
13 certification indicating compliance with federal marketing authorization requirements.
14 Section 9 of this bill requires the Department to provide a manufacturer of vapor products
15 notice and an opportunity to cure any violation or deficiency before removing the
16 manufacturer or any vapor products from the directory. Section 9 prohibits a wholesale dealer
17 from purchasing vapor products that have been removed from the directory and requires a
18 retail dealer or wholesale dealer who receives notice of the removal of a product or
19 manufacturer from the directory to take certain actions. Section 10 of this bill prohibits vapor
20 products that are not included in the directory, on or after the date the Department first makes
21 the directory available for public inspection, from being sold in this State or to a consumer in
22 this State. Sections 11 and 12 of this bill require nonresident and foreign manufacturers of
23 vapor products to appoint an agent in this State for service of process and to submit a bond
24 payable to the State, respectively.
25 Section 13 of this bill provides for annual unannounced compliance checks on each
26 retailer, distributor and wholesaler that sells or distributes vapor products in this State. Section
27 14 of this bill provides civil penalties for selling or offering for sale any vapor product not
28 included in the directory. Section 14.5 of this bill creates the Account for Vapor Product
29 Enforcement in the State General Fund. Section 15 of this bill requires the Department to
30 prepare and submit to the Legislature an annual report regarding the directory and section 16
31 of this bill requires the Department to adopt regulations to carry out the provisions of sections
32 2-16 of this bill.
33 Sections 3, 4 and 5 define certain terms for purposes of implementing the provisions of
34 this bill, including “vapor product,” which is defined for such purposes to mean any
35 noncombustible product containing nicotine.
36 Section 17 of this bill authorizes the seizure of any cigarette, product containing, made or
37 derived from tobacco, vapor product, alternative nicotine product or product containing, made
38 or derived from nicotine sold by a person without a license. Section 18 of this bill prohibits a
39 person from selling, giving, delivering or furnishing to a person a nicotine analogue and
40 defines the term “nicotine analogue” for such purposes. Section 19.5 of this bill authorizes
41 the seizure of nicotine analogue products under certain circumstances. Section 20 of this
42 bill authorizes the Department to share information obtained in investigations with federal,
43 state or local agencies for purposes of enforcement of corresponding laws of other states.
44 Section 21 of this bill exempts certain information provided in a certification executed and
45 delivered pursuant to section 6 from the requirement that public records and public books be
46 open to inspection. Section 21.5 of this bill makes an appropriation to the Office of the
47 Attorney General for the purposes of carrying out the provisions of sections 2-16.

20 disposal must be borne by the person from whom the vapor products are
21 confiscated.
22 Sec. 11. 1. Any nonresident or foreign manufacturer of vapor products
23 that has not registered to do business in this State, as a condition precedent to

26 this State to act as its agent for the service of process on whom all process, in any
27 action or proceeding against it concerning or arising out of the enforcement of
28 sections 2 to 16, inclusive, of this act, may be served in any manner authorized by
29 law.
30 2. Service upon an agent pursuant to this section constitutes legal and valid

33 such agent to, and to the satisfaction of, the Attorney General.
34 3. The manufacturer shall provide notice to the Attorney General at least 30

50 Sec. 12. 1. Any nonresident or foreign manufacturer of vapor products
51 that has not registered to do business in this State as a foreign corporation or

9 costs of seizure and destruction of vapor products sold in violation of sections 2 to

13 3. A surety on a bond furnished by a manufacturer as provided in this
14 section must be released and discharged from liability to the State accruing on
15 the bond 60 days after the date on which the surety lodges with the Attorney

18 or which accrues before the expiration of the 60-day period. The Attorney
19 General shall, upon receiving any such request, notify the manufacturer who
20 furnished the bond. Unless the manufacturer, on or before the expiration of the
21 60-day period, files with the Attorney General a new bond, with the surety
22 approved by and acceptable to the Attorney General, the Attorney General shall
23 remove the manufacturer and its vapor products from the directory.
24 Sec. 13. Each retailer, distributor and wholesaler that sells or distributes
25 vapor products in this State is subject to at least two unannounced compliance
26 checks annually , by the Department or the Attorney General or any designated
27 agent of the Department or Attorney General, for purposes of enforcing the
28 provisions of sections 2 to 16, inclusive, of this act. Unannounced follow-up
29 compliance checks of all noncompliant retailers, distributors and wholesalers

33 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
34 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
35 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by means of an
36 electronic medium would:

38 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential and that
39 cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from information that is not
40 otherwise confidential.
41 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who has legal
42 custody or control of a public record:

45 prefer to provide the copy in a different medium.
46 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon request, prepare
47 the copy of the public record and shall not require the person who has requested the

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Department of Taxation to regulate and collect a tax on
2 cigarettes and other tobacco products and distinguishes alternative nicotine products and
3 vapor products from other tobacco products for such purposes. (Chapter 370 of NRS) Existing
4 law also requires: (1) manufacturers of tobacco products whose cigarettes are sold in this State

Senate Amendment No. 850 to Senate Bill No. 435 First Reprint Page 4
5 to execute and deliver a certification to the Attorney General; and (2) the Department to create
6 and maintain a directory of all manufacturers that have executed and delivered such
7 certifications. (NRS 370.665, 370.675)
8 Section 6 of this bill similarly requires manufacturers of vapor products to execute and
9 deliver a certification to the Attorney General. Section 7 of this bill requires such a
10 manufacturer to notify the Attorney General not later than 30 days after any material change
11 to the certification. Section 8 of this bill requires the Department to create and maintain a
12 directory of all manufacturers of vapor products that have executed and delivered a
13 certification indicating compliance with federal marketing authorization requirements.
14 Section 9 of this bill requires the Department to provide a manufacturer of vapor products
15 notice and an opportunity to cure any violation or deficiency before removing the
16 manufacturer or any vapor products from the directory. Section 9 prohibits a wholesale dealer
17 from purchasing vapor products that have been removed from the directory and requires a
18 retail dealer or wholesale dealer who receives notice of the removal of a product or
19 manufacturer from the directory to take certain actions. Section 10 of this bill prohibits vapor
20 products that are not included in the directory, on or after the date the Department first makes
21 the directory available for public inspection, from being sold in this State or to a consumer in
22 this State. Sections 11 and 12 of this bill require nonresident and foreign manufacturers of
23 vapor products to appoint an agent in this State for service of process and to submit a bond
24 payable to the State, respectively.
25 Section 13 of this bill provides for annual unannounced compliance checks on each
26 retailer, distributor and wholesaler that sells or distributes vapor products in this State. Section
27 14 of this bill provides civil penalties for selling or offering for sale any vapor product not
28 included in the directory. Section 14.5 of this bill creates the Account for Vapor Product
29 Enforcement in the State General Fund. Section 15 of this bill requires the Department to
30 prepare and submit to the Legislature an annual report regarding the directory and section 16
31 of this bill requires the Department to adopt regulations to carry out the provisions of sections

8 Statutes of Nevada 2011 and section 2 of chapter 391, Statutes of Nevada 2013 and
9 unless otherwise declared by law to be confidential, all public books and public
10 records of a governmental entity must be open at all times during office hours to
11 inspection by any person, and may be fully copied or an abstract or memorandum
12 may be prepared from those public books and public records. Any such copies,
13 abstracts or memoranda may be used to supply the general public with copies,
14 abstracts or memoranda of the records or may be used in any other way to the
15 advantage of the governmental entity or of the general public. This section does not
16 supersede or in any manner affect the federal laws governing copyrights or enlarge,
17 diminish or affect in any other manner the rights of a person in any written book or
18 record which is copyrighted pursuant to federal law.
19 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record which is
20 copyrighted solely because it is copyrighted.
21 3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a public book or
22 record shall not deny a request made pursuant to subsection 1 to inspect or copy or
23 receive a copy of a public book or record on the basis that the requested public
24 book or record contains information that is confidential if the governmental entity
25 can redact, delete, conceal or separate, including, without limitation, electronically,
26 the confidential information from the information included in the public book or
27 record that is not otherwise confidential.
28 4. If requested, a governmental entity shall provide a copy of a public record
29 in an electronic format by means of an electronic medium. Nothing in this
30 subsection requires a governmental entity to provide a copy of a public record in an
31 electronic format or by means of an electronic medium if:
32 (a) The public record:
33 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
34 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
35 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by means of an
36 electronic medium would:
37 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
38 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential and that
39 cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from information that is not
40 otherwise confidential.
41 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who has legal
42 custody or control of a public record:
43 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the medium that
44 is requested because the officer, employee or agent has already prepared or would
45 prefer to provide the copy in a different medium.
46 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon request, prepare
47 the copy of the public record and shall not require the person who has requested the
48 copy to prepare the copy himself or herself.

2 the end of the respective fiscal years must not be committed for expenditure
3 after June 30 of the respective fiscal years by the entity to which the
4 appropriation is made or any entity to which money from the appropriation is
5 granted or otherwise transferred in any manner, and any portion of the
6 appropriated money remaining must not be spent for any purpose after
7 September 18, 2026, and September 17, 2027, respectively, by either the entity
8 to which the money was appropriated or the entity to which the money was
9 subsequently granted or transferred, and must be reverted to the State
10 General Fund on or before September 18, 2026, and September 17, 2027,
11 respectively.
