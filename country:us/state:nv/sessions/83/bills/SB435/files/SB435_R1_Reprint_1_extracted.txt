Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Department of Taxation to regulate and collect a tax
2 on cigarettes and other tobacco products and distinguishes alternative nicotine
3 products and vapor products from other tobacco products for such purposes.
4 (Chapter 370 of NRS) Existing law also requires: (1) manufacturers of tobacco
5 products whose cigarettes are sold in this State to execute and deliver a certification
6 to the Attorney General; and (2) the Department to create and maintain a directory
7 of all manufacturers that have executed and delivered such certifications. (NRS
8 370.665, 370.675)
9 Section 6 of this bill similarly requires manufacturers of vapor products to
10 execute and deliver a certification to the Attorney General. Section 7 of this bill
11 requires such a manufacturer to notify the Attorney General not later than 30 days
12 after any material change to the certification. Section 8 of this bill requires the
13 Department to create and maintain a directory of all manufacturers of vapor
14 products that have executed and delivered a certification indicating compliance
15 with federal marketing authorization requirements. Section 9 of this bill requires
16 the Department to provide a manufacturer of vapor products notice and an
17 opportunity to cure any violation or deficiency before removing the manufacturer
18 or any vapor products from the directory. Section 9 prohibits a wholesale dealer
19 from purchasing vapor products that have been removed from the directory and
20 requires a retail dealer or wholesale dealer who receives notice of the removal of a
21 product or manufacturer from the directory to take certain actions. Section 10 of
22 this bill prohibits vapor products that are not included in the directory, on or after
23 the date the Department first makes the directory available for public inspection,
24 from being sold in this State or to a consumer in this State. Sections 11 and 12 of
25 this bill require nonresident and foreign manufacturers of vapor products to appoint
26 an agent in this State for service of process and to submit a bond payable to the
27 State, respectively.
28 Section 13 of this bill provides for annual unannounced compliance checks on
29 each retailer, distributor and wholesaler that sells or distributes vapor products in
30 this State. Section 14 of this bill provides civil penalties for selling or offering for
31 sale any vapor product not included in the directory. Section 15 of this bill requires
32 the Department to prepare and submit to the Legislature an annual report regarding
33 the directory and section 16 of this bill requires the Department to adopt
34 regulations to carry out the provisions of sections 2-16 of this bill.
35 Sections 3, 4 and 5 define certain terms for purposes of implementing the
36 provisions of this bill, including “vapor product,” which is defined for such
37 purposes to mean any noncombustible product containing nicotine.
38 Section 17 of this bill authorizes the seizure of any cigarette, product
39 containing, made or derived from tobacco, vapor product, alternative nicotine
40 product or product containing, made or derived from nicotine sold by a person
41 without a license. Section 18 of this bill prohibits a person from selling, giving,
42 delivering or furnishing to a person a nicotine analogue and defines the term
43 “nicotine analogue” for such purposes. Section 20 of this bill authorizes the
44 Department to share information obtained in investigations with federal, state or
45 local agencies for purposes of enforcement of corresponding laws of other states.
46 Section 21 of this bill exempts certain information provided in a certification
47 executed and delivered pursuant to section 6 from the requirement that public
48 records and public books be open to inspection.

19 as a condition precedent to having its name or its vapor products
20 listed and retained in the directory, shall appoint and continually
21 engage without interruption the services of an agent in this State
22 to act as its agent for the service of process on whom all process,

24 the enforcement of sections 2 to 16, inclusive, of this act, may be
25 served in any manner authorized by law.
26 2. Service upon an agent pursuant to this section constitutes

-
*SB435_R1*
– 10 –
1 manufacturer may be proceeded against in courts of this State by

6 Sec. 12. 1. Any nonresident or foreign manufacturer of
7 vapor products that has not registered to do business in this State

13 located within the United States.
14 2. The bond must be conditioned on the performance by the
15 manufacturer of all requirements and obligations imposed by

30 request to be released and discharged. This provision does not
31 operate to relieve, release or discharge the surety from liability
32 already accrued or which accrues before the expiration of the 60-
33 day period. The Attorney General shall, upon receiving any such
34 request, notify the manufacturer who furnished the bond. Unless
35 the manufacturer, on or before the expiration of the 60-day
36 period, files with the Attorney General a new bond, with the surety
37 approved by and acceptable to the Attorney General, the Attorney
38 General shall remove the manufacturer and its vapor products
39 from the directory.
40 Sec. 13. Each retailer, distributor and wholesaler that sells
41 or distributes vapor products in this State is subject to at least two
42 unannounced compliance checks annually for purposes of

5 Sec. 14. 1. In addition to any other penalty authorized by
6 law, the Attorney General may impose the following civil penalty

15 retailer, distributor, wholesaler or importer that is issued by the
16 Department pursuant to this chapter.
17 2. A manufacturer whose vapor products are not listed in the
18 directory and who causes the products that are not listed to be sold
19 for retail sale in this State, whether directly or indirectly through
20 an importer, distributor, wholesaler, retailer or similar
21 intermediary or intermediaries is subject to a civil penalty of
22 $10,000 for each individual vapor product offered for sale in
23 violation of this section. In addition, any manufacturer that falsely
24 represents any information required by a certification pursuant to
25 section 6 of this act is guilty of a misdemeanor for each false
26 representation.
27 3. In an action to enforce the provisions of sections 2 to 16,
28 inclusive, of this act, the State is entitled to recover costs,
29 including the costs of investigation, expert witness fees and

32 a deceptive trade practice for the purposes of NRS 598.0903 to
33 598.0999, inclusive.

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Department of Taxation to regulate and collect a tax
2 on cigarettes and other tobacco products and distinguishes alternative nicotine
3 products and vapor products from other tobacco products for such purposes.
4 (Chapter 370 of NRS) Existing law also requires: (1) manufacturers of tobacco
5 products whose cigarettes are sold in this State to execute and deliver a certification
6 to the Attorney General; and (2) the Department to create and maintain a directory
7 of all manufacturers that have executed and delivered such certifications. (NRS
8 370.665, 370.675)
9 Section 6 of this bill similarly requires manufacturers of vapor products to
10 execute and deliver a certification to the Attorney General. Section 7 of this bill
11 requires such a manufacturer to notify the Attorney General not later than 30 days
12 after any material change to the certification. Section 8 of this bill requires the
13 Department to create and maintain a directory of all manufacturers of vapor
14 products that have executed and delivered a certification indicating compliance
15 with federal marketing authorization requirements. Section 9 of this bill requires
16 the Department to provide a manufacturer of vapor products notice and an
17 opportunity to cure any violation or deficiency before removing the manufacturer
18 or any vapor products from the directory. Section 9 prohibits a wholesale dealer
19 from purchasing vapor products that have been removed from the directory and
20 requires a retail dealer or wholesale dealer who receives notice of the removal of a
21 product or manufacturer from the directory to take certain actions. Section 10 of
22 this bill prohibits vapor products that are not included in the directory, on or after
23 the date the Department first makes the directory available for public inspection,
24 from being sold in this State or to a consumer in this State. Sections 11 and 12 of
25 this bill require nonresident and foreign manufacturers of vapor products to appoint
26 an agent in this State for service of process and to submit a bond payable to the
27 State, respectively.
28 Section 13 of this bill provides for annual unannounced compliance checks on
29 each retailer, distributor and wholesaler that sells or distributes vapor products in
30 this State. Section 14 of this bill provides civil penalties for selling or offering for
31 sale any vapor product not included in the directory. Section 15 of this bill requires
32 the Department to prepare and submit to the Legislature an annual report regarding
33 the directory and section 16 of this bill requires the Department to adopt
34 regulations to carry out the provisions of sections 2-16 of this bill.
35 Sections 3, 4 and 5 define certain terms for purposes of implementing the
36 provisions of this bill, including “vapor product,” which is defined for such
37 purposes to mean any noncombustible product containing nicotine.
38 Section 17 of this bill authorizes the seizure of any cigarette, product
39 containing, made or derived from tobacco, vapor product, alternative nicotine
40 product or product containing, made or derived from nicotine sold by a person
41 without a license. Section 18 of this bill prohibits a person from selling, giving,
42 delivering or furnishing to a person a nicotine analogue and defines the term
43 “nicotine analogue” for such purposes. Section 20 of this bill authorizes the
44 Department to share information obtained in investigations with federal, state or
45 local agencies for purposes of enforcement of corresponding laws of other states.
46 Section 21 of this bill exempts certain information provided in a certification
47 executed and delivered pursuant to section 6 from the requirement that public
48 records and public books be open to inspection.

14 section or section 9 of this act. The cost of any seizure, forfeiture
15 and destruction or disposal must be borne by the person from
16 whom the vapor products are confiscated.
17 Sec. 11. 1. Any nonresident or foreign manufacturer of
18 vapor products that has not registered to do business in this State,
19 as a condition precedent to having its name or its vapor products
20 listed and retained in the directory, shall appoint and continually
21 engage without interruption the services of an agent in this State
22 to act as its agent for the service of process on whom all process,
23 in any action or proceeding against it concerning or arising out of
24 the enforcement of sections 2 to 16, inclusive, of this act, may be
25 served in any manner authorized by law.
26 2. Service upon an agent pursuant to this section constitutes
27 legal and valid service of process on the manufacturer. The
28 manufacturer shall provide the name, address, phone number and
29 proof of the appointment and availability of such agent to, and to
30 the satisfaction of, the Attorney General.
31 3. The manufacturer shall provide notice to the Attorney

– 10 –
1 manufacturer may be proceeded against in courts of this State by

3 appointment of the Secretary of State as the agent does not satisfy
4 the condition precedent to having the vapor products of the
5 manufacturer listed or retained in the directory.
6 Sec. 12. 1. Any nonresident or foreign manufacturer of
7 vapor products that has not registered to do business in this State
8 as a foreign corporation or business entity shall, as a condition
9 precedent to having its name or its vapor products listed and

11 bond or other cash security payable to the State of Nevada in the
12 amount of $25,000. The bond must be posted by a corporate surety
13 located within the United States.
14 2. The bond must be conditioned on the performance by the
15 manufacturer of all requirements and obligations imposed by
16 sections 2 to 16, inclusive, of this act. A surety on a
17 manufacturer’s bond is liable up to the amount of the bond, and
18 the State may execute on the surety bond, for the payment of fines
19 and penalties imposed on the manufacturer under section 14 of
20 this act and for the costs of seizure and destruction of vapor
21 products sold in violation of sections 2 to 16, inclusive, of this act.
22 If the State executes on the surety bond, it may require the
23 manufacturer to provide an additional bond as a condition
24 precedent for retaining the manufacturer or its vapor products in
25 the directory.
26 3. A surety on a bond furnished by a manufacturer as
27 provided in this section must be released and discharged from
28 liability to the State accruing on the bond 60 days after the date on
29 which the surety lodges with the Attorney General a written
30 request to be released and discharged. This provision does not
31 operate to relieve, release or discharge the surety from liability
32 already accrued or which accrues before the expiration of the 60-
33 day period. The Attorney General shall, upon receiving any such
34 request, notify the manufacturer who furnished the bond. Unless
35 the manufacturer, on or before the expiration of the 60-day
36 period, files with the Attorney General a new bond, with the surety
37 approved by and acceptable to the Attorney General, the Attorney
38 General shall remove the manufacturer and its vapor products
39 from the directory.
40 Sec. 13. Each retailer, distributor and wholesaler that sells
41 or distributes vapor products in this State is subject to at least two
42 unannounced compliance checks annually for purposes of

4 available to the public on request.
5 Sec. 14. 1. In addition to any other penalty authorized by
6 law, the Attorney General may impose the following civil penalty
7 on a retailer, distributor, wholesaler or importer who sells or
8 offers for sale a vapor product for retail sale in this State or to a

14 period, $10,000 and the Department may revoke any license of the
15 retailer, distributor, wholesaler or importer that is issued by the
16 Department pursuant to this chapter.
17 2. A manufacturer whose vapor products are not listed in the
18 directory and who causes the products that are not listed to be sold
19 for retail sale in this State, whether directly or indirectly through
20 an importer, distributor, wholesaler, retailer or similar
21 intermediary or intermediaries is subject to a civil penalty of
22 $10,000 for each individual vapor product offered for sale in
23 violation of this section. In addition, any manufacturer that falsely
24 represents any information required by a certification pursuant to
25 section 6 of this act is guilty of a misdemeanor for each false
26 representation.
27 3. In an action to enforce the provisions of sections 2 to 16,
28 inclusive, of this act, the State is entitled to recover costs,
29 including the costs of investigation, expert witness fees and
30 reasonable attorney’s fees.
31 4. A second or subsequent violation of this section constitutes
32 a deceptive trade practice for the purposes of NRS 598.0903 to
33 598.0999, inclusive.
34 5. All fees and penalties collected by the Attorney General
35 pursuant to this section and sections 2 to 16, inclusive, of this act,
36 must be used for the administration and enforcement of sections 2
37 to 16, inclusive, of this act, including, without limitation,
38 contracting with a facility that has been issued a permit to treat or
39 store vapor products.

15 person without a license required by this chapter is subject to
16 seizure. A sheriff or other peace officer shall provide written
17 notification of any such seizure to the Department not later than 5
18 working days after the seizure. The notification must include the
19 reason for the seizure. After consultation with the Department, the
20 sheriff or other peace officer may transmit the vapor products to

22 approves the transmission. The sheriff or other peace officer who
23 seizes any vapor product may, if he or she does not transmit the
24 vapor products to the Department, destroy the vapor products.

1 entity must be open at all times during office hours to inspection by
2 any person, and may be fully copied or an abstract or memorandum
3 may be prepared from those public books and public records. Any
4 such copies, abstracts or memoranda may be used to supply the
5 general public with copies, abstracts or memoranda of the records or
6 may be used in any other way to the advantage of the governmental
7 entity or of the general public. This section does not supersede or in
8 any manner affect the federal laws governing copyrights or enlarge,
9 diminish or affect in any other manner the rights of a person in any
10 written book or record which is copyrighted pursuant to federal law.
11 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record
12 which is copyrighted solely because it is copyrighted.
13 3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a
14 public book or record shall not deny a request made pursuant to
15 subsection 1 to inspect or copy or receive a copy of a public book or
16 record on the basis that the requested public book or record contains
17 information that is confidential if the governmental entity can
18 redact, delete, conceal or separate, including, without limitation,
19 electronically, the confidential information from the information
20 included in the public book or record that is not otherwise
21 confidential.
22 4. If requested, a governmental entity shall provide a copy of a
23 public record in an electronic format by means of an electronic
24 medium. Nothing in this subsection requires a governmental entity
25 to provide a copy of a public record in an electronic format or by
26 means of an electronic medium if:
27 (a) The public record:
28 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
29 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
30 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by
31 means of an electronic medium would:
32 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
33 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential
34 and that cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from
35 information that is not otherwise confidential.
36 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who
37 has legal custody or control of a public record:
38 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the
39 medium that is requested because the officer, employee or agent has
40 already prepared or would prefer to provide the copy in a different
41 medium.
42 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon
43 request, prepare the copy of the public record and shall not require
44 the person who has requested the copy to prepare the copy himself
45 or herself.
