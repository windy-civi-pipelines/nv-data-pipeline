AN ACT relating to motor vehicles; requiring the Department of
Motor Vehicles to design, prepare and issue special
license plates honoring veterans of the Armed Forces of
the United States who have served on a unit that was
awarded the Presidential Unit Citation; exempting the
special license plates from certain provisions otherwise
applicable to special license plates; establishing the
applicability of certain parking privileges for a vehicle
displaying the special license plates that bear the
international symbol of access; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law entitles veterans of the Armed Forces of the United States who
2 have received certain awards, honors or designations to be issued license plates
3 specially designed by the Department of Motor Vehicles. (NRS 482.3765, 482.377,
4 482.3775, 482.3783) Section 1 of this bill entitles a veteran of the Armed Forces
5 who has served on a unit that was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation to apply
6 for and receive special license plates indicating that the veteran served on such a
7 unit. Section 1 requires the Department, with certain exceptions, to create, for each
8 branch of the Armed Forces, a unique license plate design for the special license
9 plates based on the design of the service ribbon representing the Presidential Unit
10 Citation within each branch. Section 1 provides that a qualified veteran may: (1)
11 apply for not more than two sets of special license plates; (2) use such license plates
12 only on private passenger vehicles, noncommercial trucks or motor homes; and (3)
13 combine the special license plates with personalized prestige license plates upon the
14 payment of the applicable fees. Section 1 provides that, unless the special license
-

– 2 –
15 plates are lost, stolen or mutilated, in which case a fee to defray the cost of
16 producing the license plate applies, no fee in addition to the ordinarily applicable
17 registration and license fees and governmental services taxes may be charged for
18 the issuance or renewal of a set of the special license plates. Section 1 further
19 provides that: (1) a veteran who is eligible for such special license plates and who,
20 as a result of his or her service, has suffered a qualifying service-connected
21 disability and receives compensation from the United States for the disability, may
22 have the international symbol of access inscribed on his or her special license plate;
23 and (2) a vehicle on which such special license plates bearing the international
24 symbol of access are displayed is exempt from the payment of parking fees,
25 including, without limitation, those collected through parking meters, charged by
26 the State or any political subdivision or other public body within the State, except
27 those parking fees charged by the Federal Government. Sections 11 and 12 of this
28 bill make conforming changes to authorize a vehicle displaying the special license
29 plates that bear the international symbol of access to park in certain designated
30 parking spots for persons who are handicapped and to remain parked for up to 4
31 hours in certain other, time-limited, public parking spots in the same manner as
32 vehicles displaying other license plates that bear the international symbol of access.
33 (NRS 484B.463, 484B.467)
34 Section 2 of this bill prohibits a new vehicle dealer who is authorized to issue
35 certificates of registration for any new motor vehicle he or she sells from accepting
36 an application for the registration of a motor vehicle if the applicant wishes to
37 obtain the special plates indicating service on a unit which received the Presidential
38 Unit Citation. Section 3 of this bill prohibits the Department from issuing
39 redesigned license plates to the holder of a set of special license plates indicating
40 service on a unit which received the Presidential Unit Citation without the approval
41 of the holder. Section 4 of this bill authorizes the Director of the Department to
42 order the preparation of sample license plates bearing the same design as the special
43 license plates indicating service on a unit which received the Presidential Unit
44 Citation. Section 5 of this bill prohibits the Department from issuing special plates
45 indicating service on a unit which received the Presidential Unit Citation for a full
46 trailer or semitrailer, other than a recreational vehicle and travel trailer.
47 Under existing law, certain special license plates: (1) must be approved by the
48 Department; (2) are subject to a limitation on the number of separate designs of
49 special license plates which the Department may issue at any one time; and (3) may
50 not be designed, prepared or issued by the Department unless a certain minimum
51 number of applications for the plates are received. (NRS 482.367002, 482.367008,
52 482.36705) Sections 6-8 of this bill exempt the special plates indicating service on
53 a unit which received the Presidential Unit Citation from these provisions.
54 Section 9 of this bill exempts the special license plates indicating service on a
55 unit which received the Presidential Unit Citation from the definition of “special
56 license plate” applicable to provisions governing investigations relating to the
57 finances of charitable organizations that receive additional fees from special license
58 plates. (NRS 482.38272-482.38279) Section 10 of this bill makes a conforming
59 change to authorize the holder of the original registration of any vehicle to transfer
60 the registration and use of the special license plates indicating service on a unit
61 which received the Presidential Unit Citation to another vehicle under certain
62 circumstances.
