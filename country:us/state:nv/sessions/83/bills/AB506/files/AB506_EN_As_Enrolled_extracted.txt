Raw Text:
Assembly Bill No. 506–Committee on Ways and Means
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to governmental administration; eliminating
certain reporting requirements to the Legislative Branch of
State Government; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law creates the Interim Finance Committee, commonly known as IFC,
which is authorized to exercise certain powers only when the Legislature is not in a
regular or special session. (NRS 218E.400, 218E.405)
Section 1 of this bill eliminates the requirement that the Attorney General
submit annually to IFC an itemized statement of the income and expenditures for
the Registry Account created in the State General Fund for purposes of depositing
the fees paid by certain telephone solicitors.
Section 2 of this bill eliminates the requirement that the Executive Director of
the Office of Economic Development within the Office of the Governor submit an
annual report to IFC relating to the Catalyst Account and certain transferable tax
credits to promote economic development.
Section 3 of this bill eliminates the requirement that the Director of the
Department of Corrections submit a report to each meeting of IFC identifying any
accounts receivable relating to a program for the employment of offenders.
Existing law creates the Legislative Bureau of Educational Accountability and
Program Evaluation within the Fiscal Analysis Division of the Legislative Counsel
Bureau, which has certain duties relating to: (1) collecting and analyzing data; and
(2) conducting studies and analyses relating to the public education system within
the State. Existing law further requires the Legislative Bureau of Educational
Accountability and Program Evaluation to submit a written report of its findings on
such issues: (1) on or before October 1 of each even-numbered year to the Director
of the Legislative Counsel Bureau for transmission to the next regular session; and
(2) on or before October 1 of each odd-numbered year to the Director for
transmission to the Legislative Commission and the Joint Interim Standing
Committee on Education. (NRS 218E.625) Section 4 of this bill eliminates the
requirement that the Bureau submit a written report of its findings on or before
October 1 of each odd-numbered year to the Director for transmission to the
Legislative Commission and the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Education.
Under existing law, any state employee or group of state employees may
submit to the Merit Award Board an employee suggestion, which is a proposal that
would: (1) reduce, eliminate or avoid state expenditures; or (2) improve the
operation of the State Government. (NRS 285.014, 285.050) Existing law requires
the Board to provide a report relating to employee suggestions to the Budget
Division of the Office of Finance and IFC not later than 90 days after the end of
each fiscal year ending on June 30 of an even-numbered year. (NRS 285.060)
Section 5 of this bill eliminates the requirement that such a report be submitted to
IFC.
Existing law requires each local government that enters into a performance
contract to submit a report that includes certain information relating to such
contracts to the Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau for transmittal to the
Legislature if the Legislature is in session or to the Interim Finance Committee if
the Legislature is not in session. (NRS 332.431) Section 6 of this bill eliminates the
requirement that the report be submitted to IFC when the Legislature is not in
