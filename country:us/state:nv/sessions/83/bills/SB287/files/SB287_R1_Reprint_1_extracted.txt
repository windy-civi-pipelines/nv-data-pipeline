EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public works; expanding the recordkeeping
requirements for contractors and subcontractors engaged
on a public work; providing an exception to the
confidentiality of such records; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires a contractor and each subcontractor engaged on a public
2 work to keep or cause to be kept an accurate record showing, for each worker
3 employed by the contractor or subcontractor in connection with the public work,
4 the worker’s: (1) name; (2) occupation; (3) gender, if voluntarily specified; (4)
5 ethnicity, if voluntarily specified; (5) issuing state or jurisdiction of the driver’s
6 license or identification card of the worker, if applicable; and (6) actual per diem,
7 wages and benefits. Existing law also requires a contractor and each subcontractor
8 engaged on a public work to keep or cause to be kept an additional accurate record
9 showing, for each worker employed by the contractor or subcontractor in
10 connection with the public work who has a driver’s license or identification card,
11 the: (1) name of the worker; (2) driver’s license number or identification card
12 number of the worker; and (3) state or other jurisdiction that issued the driver’s
13 license or identification card. Existing law provides that such an additional record
14 showing the name and driver’s license or identification card number of such a
15 worker is confidential and not open to public inspection. (NRS 338.070) This bill
16 expands the requirement for such a record to include the total number of hours and
17 overtime hours worked each day and each week by a worker. This bill additionally
18 creates an exception to the confidentiality of the additional record if the inspection
19 is requested by a joint labor-management committee established under the Labor
20 Management Cooperation Act of 1978 pursuant to 29 U.S.C. § 175a.

8 (b) When making payments to the contractor engaged on the

39  A contractor or subcontractor shall not compel or coerce a worker

37 awarding the contract. The contractor engaged on the public work or
38 subcontractor engaged on the public work shall ensure that a copy of
39 each record for each calendar month is received by the public body
40 awarding the contract no later than 15 days after the end of the

30 thereof, performing work for a public work who neglects to comply
31 with the provisions of this section is guilty of a misdemeanor.
