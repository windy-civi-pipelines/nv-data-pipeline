EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public works; expanding the recordkeeping requirements for
contractors and subcontractors engaged on a public work; providing
[exceptions] an exception to the confidentiality of such records; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires a contractor and each subcontractor engaged on a public work to
2 keep or cause to be kept an accurate record showing, for each worker employed by the
3 contractor or subcontractor in connection with the public work, the worker’s: (1) name; (2)
4 occupation; (3) gender, if voluntarily specified; (4) ethnicity, if voluntarily specified; (5)
5 issuing state or jurisdiction of the driver’s license or identification card of the worker, if
6 applicable; and (6) actual per diem, wages and benefits. Existing law also requires a contractor
7 and each subcontractor engaged on a public work to keep or cause to be kept an additional
8 accurate record showing, for each worker employed by the contractor or subcontractor in
9 connection with the public work who has a driver’s license or identification card, the: (1)
10 name of the worker; (2) driver’s license number or identification card number of the worker;
11 and (3) state or other jurisdiction that issued the driver’s license or identification card.
12 Existing law provides that such an additional record showing the name and driver’s license or
13 identification card number of such a worker is confidential and not open to public inspection.
14 (NRS 338.070) This bill expands the requirement for such a record to include [: (1)] the total
15 number of hours and overtime hours worked each day and each week by a worker . [; and (2)
16 the address of a worker who has a driver’s license or identification card.] This bill additionally
17 creates an exception to the confidentiality of the additional record if the inspection is
18 requested by [either] a joint labor-management committee established under the Labor
19 Management Cooperation Act of 1978 pursuant to 29 U.S.C. § 175a . [or to a multiemployer
20 Taft-Hartley trust fund formed pursuant to 29 U.S.C § 186(c)(5).]
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 338.070 is hereby amended to read as follows:

1 determine whether a violation has been committed and inform the Labor
2 Commissioner of any such violations; and
3 (b) When making payments to the contractor engaged on the public work of

12 with the terms of NRS 338.010 to 338.090, inclusive. If payment has already been
13 made to the subcontractor, the contractor may recover from the subcontractor the

16 the public work shall:

20 (2) Whether the worker wishes to specify voluntarily his or her ethnicity;
21 and
22 (b) For each response the contractor or subcontractor receives pursuant to
23 paragraph (a):
24 (1) If the worker chose voluntarily to specify his or her gender or ethnicity,
25 or both, record the worker’s responses; and
26 (2) If the worker declined to specify his or her gender or ethnicity, or both,
27 record that the worker declined to specify such information.
28  A contractor or subcontractor shall not compel or coerce a worker to specify his
29 or her gender or ethnicity and shall not penalize or otherwise take any adverse
30 action against a worker who declines to specify his or her gender or ethnicity.
31 Before inquiring as to whether a worker wishes to specify voluntarily his or her
32 gender or ethnicity, the applicable contractor or subcontractor must inform the
33 worker that such information, if provided, will be open to public inspection as set
34 forth in subsection 6.
35 5. A contractor engaged on a public work and each subcontractor engaged on
36 the public work shall keep or cause to be kept:

4 (1) The name [and address] of the worker;
5 (2) The driver’s license number or identification card number of the
6 worker; and
7 (3) The state or other jurisdiction that issued the license or card.
8 6. The records maintained pursuant to subsection 5 must be open at all
9 reasonable hours to the inspection of the public body awarding the contract. The
10 contractor engaged on the public work or subcontractor engaged on the public work
11 shall ensure that a copy of each record for each calendar month is received by the
12 public body awarding the contract no later than 15 days after the end of the month.
13 The copy of the record maintained pursuant to paragraph (a) of subsection 5 must
14 be open to public inspection as provided in NRS 239.010. The copy of the record
15 maintained pursuant to paragraph (b) of subsection 5 is confidential and not open to
16 public inspection [.] , except to a joint labor-management committee established

20 (b) of subsection 5 shall not be deemed to satisfy a request for payroll records
21 made by a Taft-Hartley trust fund.] The records in the possession of the public
22 body awarding the contract may be discarded by the public body 2 years after final
23 payment is made by the public body for the public work. The Labor Commissioner
24 shall adopt regulations authorizing and prescribing the procedures for the electronic
25 filing of the copies of the records required to be provided monthly by a contractor
26 or subcontractor to a public body pursuant to this subsection.
27 7. A contractor engaged on a public work shall not withhold from a
28 subcontractor engaged on the public work the sums necessary to cover any
29 penalties provided pursuant to subsection 3 of NRS 338.060 that may be withheld
30 from the contractor by the public body awarding the contract because the public
31 body did not receive a copy of the record maintained by the subcontractor pursuant
32 to subsection 5 for a calendar month by the time specified in subsection 6 if:
33 (a) The subcontractor provided to the contractor, for submission to the public
34 body by the contractor, a copy of the record not later than the later of:
35 (1) Ten days after the end of the month; or
36 (2) A date agreed upon by the contractor and subcontractor; and
37 (b) The contractor failed to submit the copy of the record to the public body by
38 the time specified in subsection 6.
39  Nothing in this subsection prohibits a subcontractor from submitting a copy of a
40 record for a calendar month directly to the public body by the time specified in
41 subsection 6.
42 8. Any contractor or subcontractor, or agent or representative thereof,
43 performing work for a public work who neglects to comply with the provisions of
44 this section is guilty of a misdemeanor.

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:

10 name of the worker; (2) driver’s license number or identification card number of the worker;
