EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public works; expanding the recordkeeping
requirements for contractors and subcontractors engaged
on a public work; providing exceptions to the
confidentiality of such records; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires a contractor and each subcontractor engaged on a public
2 work to keep or cause to be kept an accurate record showing, for each worker
3 employed by the contractor or subcontractor in connection with the public work,
4 the worker’s: (1) name; (2) occupation; (3) gender, if voluntarily specified; (4)
5 ethnicity, if voluntarily specified; (5) issuing state or jurisdiction of the driver’s
6 license or identification card of the worker, if applicable; and (6) actual per diem,
7 wages and benefits. Existing law also requires a contractor and each subcontractor
8 engaged on a public work to keep or cause to be kept an additional accurate record
9 showing, for each worker employed by the contractor or subcontractor in
10 connection with the public work who has a driver’s license or identification card,
11 the: (1) name of the worker; (2) driver’s license number or identification card
12 number of the worker; and (3) state or other jurisdiction that issued the driver’s
13 license or identification card. Existing law provides that such an additional record
14 showing the name and driver’s license or identification card number of such a
15 worker is confidential and not open to public inspection. (NRS 338.070) This bill
16 expands the requirement for such a record to include: (1) the total number of hours
17 and overtime hours worked each day and each week by a worker; and (2) the
18 address of a worker who has a driver’s license or identification card. This bill
19 additionally creates an exception to the confidentiality of the additional record if
20 the inspection is requested by either a joint labor-management committee
21 established under the Labor Management Cooperation Act of 1978 pursuant to 29
22 U.S.C. § 175a or to a multiemployer Taft-Hartley trust fund formed pursuant to 29
23 U.S.C § 186(c)(5).

1 Section 1. NRS 338.070 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 338.070 1. Any public body awarding a contract shall:
3 (a) Investigate possible violations of the provisions of NRS

8 (b) When making payments to the contractor engaged on the

35 gender or ethnicity, or both, record the worker’s responses; and
36 (2) If the worker declined to specify his or her gender or
37 ethnicity, or both, record that the worker declined to specify such
38 information.
39  A contractor or subcontractor shall not compel or coerce a worker

36 open at all reasonable hours to the inspection of the public body
37 awarding the contract. The contractor engaged on the public work or
38 subcontractor engaged on the public work shall ensure that a copy of
39 each record for each calendar month is received by the public body
40 awarding the contract no later than 15 days after the end of the
41 month. The copy of the record maintained pursuant to paragraph (a)
42 of subsection 5 must be open to public inspection as provided in

7 possession of the public body awarding the contract may be
8 discarded by the public body 2 years after final payment is made by
9 the public body for the public work. The Labor Commissioner shall
10 adopt regulations authorizing and prescribing the procedures for the
11 electronic filing of the copies of the records required to be provided

18 public body awarding the contract because the public body did not

20 pursuant to subsection 5 for a calendar month by the time specified
21 in subsection 6 if:
22 (a) The subcontractor provided to the contractor, for submission
23 to the public body by the contractor, a copy of the record not later
24 than the later of:
25 (1) Ten days after the end of the month; or

27 and
28 (b) The contractor failed to submit the copy of the record to the
29 public body by the time specified in subsection 6.
30  Nothing in this subsection prohibits a subcontractor from
31 submitting a copy of a record for a calendar month directly to the
32 public body by the time specified in subsection 6.
33 8. Any contractor or subcontractor, or agent or representative
34 thereof, performing work for a public work who neglects to comply
35 with the provisions of this section is guilty of a misdemeanor.
