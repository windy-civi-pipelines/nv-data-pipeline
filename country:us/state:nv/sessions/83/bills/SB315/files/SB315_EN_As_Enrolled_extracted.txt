-
83rd Session (2025)

– 6 –
applicants to further evaluate which applicant offers the best value
for the project.
6. For each request for qualifications or proposals, the
Department shall rank the applicants and generate a final list of
eligible applicants that participated in the request for qualifications
or proposals before entering into negotiations for one or more
contracts to which the request for qualifications or proposals
applies. The ranking of the statements of qualifications or proposals
must assign a relative weight of 5 percent to the possession by the
applicant of a certificate of eligibility to receive a preference in
bidding on public works if the applicant submits a signed affidavit
that the applicant meets the requirements of subsection 1 of NRS

of federal assistance or reduces the amount of that assistance for a
particular public work because of the provisions of this subsection,
the provisions of this subsection do not apply insofar as their
application would preclude or reduce federal assistance.
7. If the Department issues a request for qualifications pursuant

than five applicants from the final list of eligible applicants who
submitted statements of qualifications and send the selected

their proposals for the preconstruction phase of the project, the
evaluation must be on a pass or fail basis or based on not more than
20 percent of the scoring, as the Department deems appropriate.
9. If the submissions in response to a request for proposals
provide sufficient information to determine which eligible applicant
has offered the best value to the public, the Department may enter
into negotiations with that applicant concerning contract terms and
award a contract for preconstruction services to that applicant. Such
a contract must provide for the subsequent negotiations of terms
governing the construction phase of the project. If the Department is
unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract with that applicant for
preconstruction services, the Department may undertake
negotiations with a separate eligible applicant that participated in the
request for proposals process.
10. Upon receipt of the final rankings of applicants, the
Department shall enter into negotiations with the highest ranked
applicant determined pursuant to the provisions of this section. If the
Department is unable to negotiate a contract with the highest ranked
applicant determined by the Department to be fair and reasonable,
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 7 –
the Department may terminate or suspend negotiations with the
highest ranked applicant. The Department may undertake
negotiations with the next highest ranked applicant in sequence until
an agreement is reached or until a determination is made by the
Department to reject all applicants.

design-build contract with a progressive design-build team pursuant

design-build team has progressed in the design for project, or any
portion thereof, in a sufficient manner to determine the cost of the
final design and construction of the project, enter into negotiations
with the progressive design-build team for a contract or a contract
amendment to complete final design and construction of the project,
or any portion thereof.
2. The progressive design-build team shall develop its price, on
a basis determined by the Department and using fully transparent,
open-book pricing, to complete the design and construction of the
project, or portion thereof.
3. If the Department is unable to negotiate a satisfactory
contract or contract amendment with the progressive design-build
team to complete the final design and construction of the project, or
portion thereof, the Department shall terminate negotiations with
that progressive design-build team and:
(a) May enter into a separate contract with a qualified person
who was a member of the progressive design-build team to
complete the design of the project, or portion thereof; or
(b) May undertake a new procurement and award the contract
for the project pursuant to the provisions of NRS 408.327 to
408.387, inclusive, or 408.3875 to 408.3888, inclusive. If a new
procurement is initiated, the Department may elect not to accept a
bid to construct the project from the progressive design-build team
with whom the Department entered into a progressive design-build
contract for preconstruction services.
Sec. 12. 1. A progressive design-build contract or contract
amendment entered into by the Department with a progressive
design-build team pursuant to section 11 of this act must:
(a) Comply with the provisions of NRS 338.013 to 338.090,

change orders as authorized by the contract;
(2) An amount that is the maximum amount that the
Department will pay for the performance of the professional
services required by the contract; and

contractor who is awarded a contract or enters into an agreement to
perform work on the project and any subcontractor who performs
work on the project shall comply with the provisions of
NRS 338.013 to 338.090, inclusive, in the same manner as if the
Department had undertaken the project or had awarded the contract.
3. A progressive design-build team to whom a progressive

contract.
(f) Must not require the design professional to defend the prime
contractor and the employees, officers and agents of the prime

the attorney’s fees and costs incurred by the prime contractor in
defending the action, by the design professional in an amount which
