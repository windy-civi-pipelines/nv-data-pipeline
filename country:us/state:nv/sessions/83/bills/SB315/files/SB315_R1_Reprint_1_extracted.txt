8 in Storey County, Nevada. Section 9 of this bill requires the Department to
9 advertise a solicitation for the project on its Internet website. Section 10 of this bill
10 provides for the issuance of a request for proposals in a one-step procurement
11 process, and a request for qualifications in a two-step procurement process. Section
12 10 prescribes the procedure for the review of submissions and the selection of an

14 for preconstruction services with a progressive design-build team.
15 If the Department enters into a progressive design-build contract with a
16 progressive design-build team pursuant to section 10, section 11 of this bill
17 authorizes the Department, after the progressive design-build team has progressed

29 20 percent of the scoring, as the Department deems appropriate.
30 9. If the submissions in response to a request for proposals
31 provide sufficient information to determine which eligible applicant
32 has offered the best value to the public, the Department may enter
33 into negotiations with that applicant concerning contract terms and
34 award a contract for preconstruction services to that applicant. Such
35 a contract must provide for the subsequent negotiations of terms
36 governing the construction phase of the project. If the Department is
37 unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract with that applicant for
38 preconstruction services, the Department may undertake
39 negotiations with a separate eligible applicant that participated in the
40 request for proposals process.
41 10. Upon receipt of the final rankings of applicants, the
42 Department shall enter into negotiations with the highest ranked
43 applicant determined pursuant to the provisions of this section. If the
44 Department is unable to negotiate a contract with the highest ranked
45 applicant determined by the Department to be fair and reasonable,

10 portion thereof, in a sufficient manner to determine the cost of the
11 final design and construction of the project, enter into negotiations
12 with the progressive design-build team for a contract or a contract
13 amendment to complete final design and construction of the project,
14 or any portion thereof.
15 2. The progressive design-build team shall develop its price, on
16 a basis determined by the Department and using fully transparent,
17 open-book pricing, to complete the design and construction of the
18 project, or portion thereof.
19 3. If the Department is unable to negotiate a satisfactory
20 contract or contract amendment with the progressive design-build
21 team to complete the final design and construction of the project, or
22 portion thereof, the Department shall terminate negotiations with
23 that progressive design-build team and:
24 (a) May enter into a separate contract with a qualified person
25 who was a member of the progressive design-build team to
26 complete the design of the project, or portion thereof; or
27 (b) May undertake a new procurement and award the contract
28 for the project pursuant to the provisions of NRS 408.327 to
29 408.387, inclusive, or 408.3875 to 408.3888, inclusive. If a new

Transportation to enter into a progressive design-build
contract for a certain project; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, the Department of Transportation is authorized to contract
2 with a design-build team with respect to a project for the design and construction,
3 reconstruction or improvement of highways in certain circumstances. (NRS
4 408.3875-408.3888) Section 8 of this bill authorizes the Department to enter into
5 one or more progressive design-build contracts for the preconstruction, final design
6 and construction of the project consisting of improvements to Interstate 80 East
7 between Vista Boulevard in Sparks, Nevada and USA Parkway (State Route 439)
8 in Storey County, Nevada. Section 9 of this bill requires the Department to
9 advertise a solicitation for the project on its Internet website. Section 10 of this bill
10 provides for the issuance of a request for proposals in a one-step procurement
11 process, and a request for qualifications in a two-step procurement process. Section
12 10 prescribes the procedure for the review of submissions and the selection of an
13 applicant. Section 10 authorizes the Department to negotiate to enter into a contract
14 for preconstruction services with a progressive design-build team.
15 If the Department enters into a progressive design-build contract with a
16 progressive design-build team pursuant to section 10, section 11 of this bill
17 authorizes the Department, after the progressive design-build team has progressed
18 in the design for project, or any portion thereof, in a sufficient manner to determine
19 the cost of the final design and construction of the project, to enter into negotiations
20 with the progressive design-build team for a contract or a contract amendment to
21 complete final design and construction of the project, or any portion thereof. If such
22 negotiations fail, section 11 requires the Department to terminate negotiations and
23 authorizes the Department to: (1) enter into a separate contract with a qualified
24 person who was a member of the progressive design-build team to complete the

29 20 percent of the scoring, as the Department deems appropriate.
30 9. If the submissions in response to a request for proposals
31 provide sufficient information to determine which eligible applicant
32 has offered the best value to the public, the Department may enter
33 into negotiations with that applicant concerning contract terms and
34 award a contract for preconstruction services to that applicant. Such
35 a contract must provide for the subsequent negotiations of terms
36 governing the construction phase of the project. If the Department is
37 unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract with that applicant for
38 preconstruction services, the Department may undertake
39 negotiations with a separate eligible applicant that participated in the
40 request for proposals process.
41 10. Upon receipt of the final rankings of applicants, the
42 Department shall enter into negotiations with the highest ranked
43 applicant determined pursuant to the provisions of this section. If the
44 Department is unable to negotiate a contract with the highest ranked
45 applicant determined by the Department to be fair and reasonable,
-
*SB315_R1*

– 7 –

5 Department to reject all applicants.
6 Sec. 11. 1. If the Department enters into a progressive
7 design-build contract with a progressive design-build team pursuant
8 to section 10 of this act, the Department may, after the progressive
9 design-build team has progressed in the design for project, or any
10 portion thereof, in a sufficient manner to determine the cost of the
11 final design and construction of the project, enter into negotiations
12 with the progressive design-build team for a contract or a contract
13 amendment to complete final design and construction of the project,
14 or any portion thereof.
15 2. The progressive design-build team shall develop its price, on
16 a basis determined by the Department and using fully transparent,
17 open-book pricing, to complete the design and construction of the
18 project, or portion thereof.
19 3. If the Department is unable to negotiate a satisfactory
20 contract or contract amendment with the progressive design-build
21 team to complete the final design and construction of the project, or
22 portion thereof, the Department shall terminate negotiations with
23 that progressive design-build team and:
24 (a) May enter into a separate contract with a qualified person
25 who was a member of the progressive design-build team to
26 complete the design of the project, or portion thereof; or
27 (b) May undertake a new procurement and award the contract
28 for the project pursuant to the provisions of NRS 408.327 to
29 408.387, inclusive, or 408.3875 to 408.3888, inclusive. If a new
30 procurement is initiated, the Department may elect not to accept a
31 bid to construct the project from the progressive design-build team
32 with whom the Department entered into a progressive design-build
33 contract for preconstruction services.
34 Sec. 12. 1. A progressive design-build contract or contract
35 amendment entered into by the Department with a progressive
36 design-build team pursuant to section 11 of this act must:

8 perform work on the project and any subcontractor who performs
9 work on the project shall comply with the provisions of
10 NRS 338.013 to 338.090, inclusive, in the same manner as if the
11 Department had undertaken the project or had awarded the contract.
12 3. A progressive design-build team to whom a progressive
13 design-build contract is awarded pursuant to section 11 of this act
14 shall:
15 (a) Assume overall responsibility for ensuring that the design
16 and construction of the project is completed in a satisfactory

27 (g) May require the design professional to defend the prime
28 contractor and the employees, officers and agents of the prime
