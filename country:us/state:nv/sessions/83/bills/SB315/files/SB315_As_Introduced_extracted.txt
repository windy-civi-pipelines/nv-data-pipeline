properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, the Department of Transportation is authorized to contract
2 with a design-build team with respect to a project for the design and construction,
3 reconstruction or improvement of highways in certain circumstances. (NRS
4 408.3875-408.3888) Section 8 of this bill authorizes the Department to enter into
5 one or more progressive design-build contracts for the preconstruction, final design
6 and construction of the project consisting of improvements to Interstate 80 East
7 between Vista Boulevard in Sparks, Nevada and USA Parkway (State Route 439)
8 in Storey County, Nevada. Section 9 of this bill requires the Department to
9 advertise a solicitation for the project on its Internet website. Section 10 of this bill
10 provides for the issuance of a request for proposals in a one-step procurement
11 process, and a request for qualifications in a two-step procurement process. Section
12 10 prescribes the procedure for the review of submissions and the selection of an
13 applicant. Section 10 authorizes the Department to negotiate to enter into a contract
14 for preconstruction services with a progressive design-build team.
15 If the Department enters into a progressive design-build contract with a
16 progressive design-build team pursuant to section 10, section 11 of this bill
17 authorizes the Department, after the progressive design-build team has progressed
18 in the design for project, or any portion thereof, in a sufficient manner to determine
19 the cost of the final design and construction of the project, to enter into negotiations
20 with the progressive design-build team for a contract or a contract amendment to
21 complete final design and construction of the project, or any portion thereof. If such
22 negotiations fail, section 11 requires the Department to terminate negotiations and
23 authorizes the Department to: (1) enter into a separate contract with a qualified
24 person who was a member of the progressive design-build team to complete the
-

– 6 –
1 applies. The ranking of the statements of qualifications or proposals
2 must assign a relative weight of 5 percent to the possession by the
3 applicant of a certificate of eligibility to receive a preference in
4 bidding on public works if the applicant submits a signed affidavit
5 that the applicant meets the requirements of subsection 1 of NRS
6 338.0117. If any federal statute or regulation precludes the granting
7 of federal assistance or reduces the amount of that assistance for a
8 particular public work because of the provisions of this subsection,
9 the provisions of this subsection do not apply insofar as their
10 application would preclude or reduce federal assistance.
11 7. If the Department issues a request for qualifications pursuant
12 to this section, the Department must select at least two but not more
13 than five applicants from the final list of eligible applicants who
14 submitted statements of qualifications and send the selected
15 applicants a request for proposals which includes the information
16 contained in subsection 4.
17 8. If applicants are required to submit cost information with
18 their proposals for the preconstruction phase of the project, the
19 evaluation must be on a pass or fail basis or based on not more than
20 20 percent of the scoring, as the Department deems appropriate.
21 9. If the submissions in response to a request for proposals
22 provide sufficient information to determine which eligible applicant
23 has offered the best value to the public, the Department may enter
24 into negotiations with that applicant concerning contract terms and
25 award a contract for preconstruction services to that applicant. Such
26 a contract must provide for the subsequent negotiations of terms
27 governing the construction phase of the project. If the Department is
28 unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract with that applicant for
29 preconstruction services, the Department may undertake
30 negotiations with a separate eligible applicant that participated in the
31 request for proposals process.
32 10. Upon receipt of the final rankings of applicants, the
33 Department shall enter into negotiations with the highest ranked
34 applicant determined pursuant to the provisions of this section. If the
35 Department is unable to negotiate a contract with the highest ranked
36 applicant determined by the Department to be fair and reasonable,
37 the Department may terminate or suspend negotiations with the
38 highest ranked applicant. The Department may undertake
39 negotiations with the next highest ranked applicant in sequence until
40 an agreement is reached or until a determination is made by the
41 Department to reject all applicants.
42 Sec. 11. 1. If the Department enters into a progressive
43 design-build contract with a progressive design-build team pursuant
44 to section 10 of this act, the Department may, after the progressive
45 design-build team has progressed in the design for project, or any
-

2 final design and construction of the project, enter into negotiations
3 with the progressive design-build team for a contract or a contract
4 amendment to complete final design and construction of the project,
5 or any portion thereof.
6 2. The progressive design-build team shall develop its price, on
7 a basis determined by the Department and using fully transparent,
8 open-book pricing, to complete the design and construction of the
9 project, or portion thereof.
10 3. If the Department is unable to negotiate a satisfactory
11 contract or contract amendment with the progressive design-build
12 team to complete the final design and construction of the project, or
13 portion thereof, the Department shall terminate negotiations with
14 that progressive design-build team and:
15 (a) May enter into a separate contract with a qualified person
16 who was a member of the progressive design-build team to
17 complete the design of the project, or portion thereof; or
18 (b) May undertake a new procurement and award the contract
19 for the project pursuant to the provisions of NRS 408.327 to
20 408.387, inclusive, or 408.3875 to 408.3888, inclusive. If a new
21 procurement is initiated, the Department may elect not to accept a
22 bid to construct the project from the progressive design-build team

24 contract for preconstruction services.
25 Sec. 12. 1. A progressive design-build contract or contract
26 amendment entered into by the Department with a progressive
27 design-build team pursuant to section 11 of this act must:

properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, the Department of Transportation is authorized to contract
2 with a design-build team with respect to a project for the design and construction,
3 reconstruction or improvement of highways in certain circumstances. (NRS
4 408.3875-408.3888) Section 8 of this bill authorizes the Department to enter into
5 one or more progressive design-build contracts for the preconstruction, final design
6 and construction of the project consisting of improvements to Interstate 80 East
7 between Vista Boulevard in Sparks, Nevada and USA Parkway (State Route 439)
8 in Storey County, Nevada. Section 9 of this bill requires the Department to
9 advertise a solicitation for the project on its Internet website. Section 10 of this bill
10 provides for the issuance of a request for proposals in a one-step procurement
11 process, and a request for qualifications in a two-step procurement process. Section
12 10 prescribes the procedure for the review of submissions and the selection of an
13 applicant. Section 10 authorizes the Department to negotiate to enter into a contract
14 for preconstruction services with a progressive design-build team.
15 If the Department enters into a progressive design-build contract with a
16 progressive design-build team pursuant to section 10, section 11 of this bill
17 authorizes the Department, after the progressive design-build team has progressed
18 in the design for project, or any portion thereof, in a sufficient manner to determine
19 the cost of the final design and construction of the project, to enter into negotiations
20 with the progressive design-build team for a contract or a contract amendment to
21 complete final design and construction of the project, or any portion thereof. If such
22 negotiations fail, section 11 requires the Department to terminate negotiations and
23 authorizes the Department to: (1) enter into a separate contract with a qualified
24 person who was a member of the progressive design-build team to complete the
-

28 Section 13 of the bill provides for the confidentiality of certain information and
29 documents concerning the project. Section 14 of this bill authorizes the Department
30 to employ a registered architect or licensed professional engineer as a consultant to
31 assist the Department in overseeing the preconstruction and construction of the

– 6 –
1 applies. The ranking of the statements of qualifications or proposals
2 must assign a relative weight of 5 percent to the possession by the
3 applicant of a certificate of eligibility to receive a preference in
4 bidding on public works if the applicant submits a signed affidavit
5 that the applicant meets the requirements of subsection 1 of NRS

12 to this section, the Department must select at least two but not more
13 than five applicants from the final list of eligible applicants who
14 submitted statements of qualifications and send the selected
15 applicants a request for proposals which includes the information

18 their proposals for the preconstruction phase of the project, the
19 evaluation must be on a pass or fail basis or based on not more than
20 20 percent of the scoring, as the Department deems appropriate.
21 9. If the submissions in response to a request for proposals
22 provide sufficient information to determine which eligible applicant
23 has offered the best value to the public, the Department may enter
24 into negotiations with that applicant concerning contract terms and
25 award a contract for preconstruction services to that applicant. Such
26 a contract must provide for the subsequent negotiations of terms
27 governing the construction phase of the project. If the Department is
28 unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract with that applicant for
29 preconstruction services, the Department may undertake
30 negotiations with a separate eligible applicant that participated in the
31 request for proposals process.
32 10. Upon receipt of the final rankings of applicants, the
33 Department shall enter into negotiations with the highest ranked
34 applicant determined pursuant to the provisions of this section. If the
35 Department is unable to negotiate a contract with the highest ranked
36 applicant determined by the Department to be fair and reasonable,
37 the Department may terminate or suspend negotiations with the
38 highest ranked applicant. The Department may undertake
39 negotiations with the next highest ranked applicant in sequence until
40 an agreement is reached or until a determination is made by the
41 Department to reject all applicants.
42 Sec. 11. 1. If the Department enters into a progressive
43 design-build contract with a progressive design-build team pursuant

7 a basis determined by the Department and using fully transparent,
8 open-book pricing, to complete the design and construction of the
9 project, or portion thereof.
10 3. If the Department is unable to negotiate a satisfactory
11 contract or contract amendment with the progressive design-build
12 team to complete the final design and construction of the project, or
13 portion thereof, the Department shall terminate negotiations with
14 that progressive design-build team and:
15 (a) May enter into a separate contract with a qualified person
16 who was a member of the progressive design-build team to
17 complete the design of the project, or portion thereof; or
18 (b) May undertake a new procurement and award the contract
19 for the project pursuant to the provisions of NRS 408.327 to
20 408.387, inclusive, or 408.3875 to 408.3888, inclusive. If a new
21 procurement is initiated, the Department may elect not to accept a
22 bid to construct the project from the progressive design-build team
23 with whom the Department entered into a progressive design-build
24 contract for preconstruction services.
25 Sec. 12. 1. A progressive design-build contract or contract
26 amendment entered into by the Department with a progressive
27 design-build team pursuant to section 11 of this act must:

36 (2) An amount that is the maximum amount that the
37 Department will pay for the performance of the professional
38 services required by the contract; and

41 2. The Department, the progressive design-build team, any
42 contractor who is awarded a contract or enters into an agreement to
43 perform work on the project and any subcontractor who performs
44 work on the project shall comply with the provisions of
-
*SB315*

– 8 –
1 NRS 338.013 to 338.090, inclusive, in the same manner as if the
2 Department had undertaken the project or had awarded the contract.
