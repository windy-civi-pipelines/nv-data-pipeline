providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, the Department of Transportation is authorized to contract with a
2 design-build team with respect to a project for the design and construction, reconstruction or
3 improvement of highways in certain circumstances. (NRS 408.3875-408.3888) Section 8 of
4 this bill authorizes the Department to enter into one or more progressive design-build
5 contracts for the preconstruction, final design and construction of the project consisting of
6 improvements to Interstate 80 East between Vista Boulevard in Sparks, Nevada and USA
7 Parkway (State Route 439) in Storey County, Nevada. Section 9 of this bill requires the
8 Department to advertise a solicitation for the project on its Internet website. Section 10 of this
9 bill provides for the issuance of a request for proposals in a one-step procurement process, and
10 a request for qualifications in a two-step procurement process. Section 10 prescribes the
11 procedure for the review of submissions and the selection of an applicant. Section 10
12 authorizes the Department to negotiate to enter into a contract for preconstruction services
13 with a progressive design-build team.
14 If the Department enters into a progressive design-build contract with a progressive
15 design-build team pursuant to section 10, section 11 of this bill authorizes the Department,
16 after the progressive design-build team has progressed in the design for project, or any portion
17 thereof, in a sufficient manner to determine the cost of the final design and construction of the
18 project, to enter into negotiations with the progressive design-build team for a contract or a
19 contract amendment to complete final design and construction of the project, or any portion
20 thereof. If such negotiations fail, section 11 requires the Department to terminate negotiations
21 and authorizes the Department to: (1) enter into a separate contract with a qualified person
22 who was a member of the progressive design-build team to complete the design of the project,
23 or portion thereof; or (2) undertake a new procurement under a different procurement method.
24 Section 12 of this bill prescribes the requirements for a progressive design-build contract
25 entered into pursuant to section 11. Section 12.5 of this bill prescribes the requirements for
26 a contract with a design professional for the provision of services for the project.
27 Section 13 of the bill provides for the confidentiality of certain information and
28 documents concerning the project. Section 14 of this bill authorizes the Department to employ
29 a registered architect or licensed professional engineer as a consultant to assist the Department
Senate Amendment No. 119 to Senate Bill No. 315 Page 4
30 in overseeing the preconstruction and construction of the project. Sections 2-7 of this bill

43 the Department may interview some or all of the applicants to further evaluate
44 which applicant offers the best value for the project.
45 6. For each request for qualifications or proposals, the Department shall rank
46 the applicants and generate a final list of eligible applicants that participated in the
47 request for qualifications or proposals before entering into negotiations for one or
48 more contracts to which the request for qualifications or proposals applies. The
49 ranking of the statements of qualifications or proposals must assign a relative
50 weight of 5 percent to the possession by the applicant of a certificate of eligibility

52 affidavit that the applicant meets the requirements of subsection 1 of NRS
53 338.0117. If any federal statute or regulation precludes the granting of federal
Senate Amendment No. 119 to Senate Bill No. 315 Page 7
1 assistance or reduces the amount of that assistance for a particular public work
2 because of the provisions of this subsection, the provisions of this subsection do not
3 apply insofar as their application would preclude or reduce federal assistance.
4 7. If the Department issues a request for qualifications pursuant to this
5 section, the Department must select at least two but not more than five applicants
6 from the final list of eligible applicants who submitted statements of qualifications
7 and send the selected applicants a request for proposals which includes the
8 information contained in subsection 4.
9 8. If applicants are required to submit cost information with their proposals
10 for the preconstruction phase of the project, the evaluation must be on a pass or fail
11 basis or based on not more than 20 percent of the scoring, as the Department deems
12 appropriate.
13 9. If the submissions in response to a request for proposals provide sufficient
14 information to determine which eligible applicant has offered the best value to the
15 public, the Department may enter into negotiations with that applicant concerning
16 contract terms and award a contract for preconstruction services to that applicant.
17 Such a contract must provide for the subsequent negotiations of terms governing
18 the construction phase of the project. If the Department is unable to negotiate a
19 satisfactory contract with that applicant for preconstruction services, the
20 Department may undertake negotiations with a separate eligible applicant that
21 participated in the request for proposals process.
22 10. Upon receipt of the final rankings of applicants, the Department shall
23 enter into negotiations with the highest ranked applicant determined pursuant to the
24 provisions of this section. If the Department is unable to negotiate a contract with
25 the highest ranked applicant determined by the Department to be fair and
26 reasonable, the Department may terminate or suspend negotiations with the highest
27 ranked applicant. The Department may undertake negotiations with the next highest
28 ranked applicant in sequence until an agreement is reached or until a determination
29 is made by the Department to reject all applicants.
30 Sec. 11. 1. If the Department enters into a progressive design-build contract
31 with a progressive design-build team pursuant to section 10 of this act, the
32 Department may, after the progressive design-build team has progressed in the
33 design for project, or any portion thereof, in a sufficient manner to determine the
34 cost of the final design and construction of the project, enter into negotiations with
35 the progressive design-build team for a contract or a contract amendment to
36 complete final design and construction of the project, or any portion thereof.
37 2. The progressive design-build team shall develop its price, on a basis
38 determined by the Department and using fully transparent, open-book pricing, to
39 complete the design and construction of the project, or portion thereof.
40 3. If the Department is unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract or contract
41 amendment with the progressive design-build team to complete the final design and
42 construction of the project, or portion thereof, the Department shall terminate
43 negotiations with that progressive design-build team and:
44 (a) May enter into a separate contract with a qualified person who was a
45 member of the progressive design-build team to complete the design of the project,
46 or portion thereof; or
47 (b) May undertake a new procurement and award the contract for the project
48 pursuant to the provisions of NRS 408.327 to 408.387, inclusive, or 408.3875 to
49 408.3888, inclusive. If a new procurement is initiated, the Department may elect
50 not to accept a bid to construct the project from the progressive design-build team
51 with whom the Department entered into a progressive design-build contract for
52 preconstruction services.

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to transportation; authorizing the Department of Transportation to
enter into a progressive design-build contract for a certain project; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, the Department of Transportation is authorized to contract with a
2 design-build team with respect to a project for the design and construction, reconstruction or
3 improvement of highways in certain circumstances. (NRS 408.3875-408.3888) Section 8 of
4 this bill authorizes the Department to enter into one or more progressive design-build
5 contracts for the preconstruction, final design and construction of the project consisting of
6 improvements to Interstate 80 East between Vista Boulevard in Sparks, Nevada and USA
7 Parkway (State Route 439) in Storey County, Nevada. Section 9 of this bill requires the
8 Department to advertise a solicitation for the project on its Internet website. Section 10 of this
9 bill provides for the issuance of a request for proposals in a one-step procurement process, and
10 a request for qualifications in a two-step procurement process. Section 10 prescribes the
11 procedure for the review of submissions and the selection of an applicant. Section 10
12 authorizes the Department to negotiate to enter into a contract for preconstruction services
13 with a progressive design-build team.
14 If the Department enters into a progressive design-build contract with a progressive
15 design-build team pursuant to section 10, section 11 of this bill authorizes the Department,
16 after the progressive design-build team has progressed in the design for project, or any portion
17 thereof, in a sufficient manner to determine the cost of the final design and construction of the
18 project, to enter into negotiations with the progressive design-build team for a contract or a
19 contract amendment to complete final design and construction of the project, or any portion
20 thereof. If such negotiations fail, section 11 requires the Department to terminate negotiations
21 and authorizes the Department to: (1) enter into a separate contract with a qualified person
22 who was a member of the progressive design-build team to complete the design of the project,
23 or portion thereof; or (2) undertake a new procurement under a different procurement method.
24 Section 12 of this bill prescribes the requirements for a progressive design-build contract
25 entered into pursuant to section 11. Section 12.5 of this bill prescribes the requirements for
26 a contract with a design professional for the provision of services for the project.
27 Section 13 of the bill provides for the confidentiality of certain information and
28 documents concerning the project. Section 14 of this bill authorizes the Department to employ
29 a registered architect or licensed professional engineer as a consultant to assist the Department

Senate Amendment No. 119 to Senate Bill No. 315 Page 4
30 in overseeing the preconstruction and construction of the project. Sections 2-7 of this bill

44 which applicant offers the best value for the project.
45 6. For each request for qualifications or proposals, the Department shall rank
46 the applicants and generate a final list of eligible applicants that participated in the
47 request for qualifications or proposals before entering into negotiations for one or

49 ranking of the statements of qualifications or proposals must assign a relative
50 weight of 5 percent to the possession by the applicant of a certificate of eligibility

52 affidavit that the applicant meets the requirements of subsection 1 of NRS
53 338.0117. If any federal statute or regulation precludes the granting of federal

Senate Amendment No. 119 to Senate Bill No. 315 Page 7
1 assistance or reduces the amount of that assistance for a particular public work
2 because of the provisions of this subsection, the provisions of this subsection do not
3 apply insofar as their application would preclude or reduce federal assistance.
4 7. If the Department issues a request for qualifications pursuant to this
5 section, the Department must select at least two but not more than five applicants
6 from the final list of eligible applicants who submitted statements of qualifications
7 and send the selected applicants a request for proposals which includes the
8 information contained in subsection 4.
9 8. If applicants are required to submit cost information with their proposals
10 for the preconstruction phase of the project, the evaluation must be on a pass or fail
11 basis or based on not more than 20 percent of the scoring, as the Department deems
12 appropriate.
13 9. If the submissions in response to a request for proposals provide sufficient
14 information to determine which eligible applicant has offered the best value to the
15 public, the Department may enter into negotiations with that applicant concerning
16 contract terms and award a contract for preconstruction services to that applicant.
17 Such a contract must provide for the subsequent negotiations of terms governing
18 the construction phase of the project. If the Department is unable to negotiate a
19 satisfactory contract with that applicant for preconstruction services, the
20 Department may undertake negotiations with a separate eligible applicant that
21 participated in the request for proposals process.
22 10. Upon receipt of the final rankings of applicants, the Department shall
23 enter into negotiations with the highest ranked applicant determined pursuant to the
24 provisions of this section. If the Department is unable to negotiate a contract with
25 the highest ranked applicant determined by the Department to be fair and
26 reasonable, the Department may terminate or suspend negotiations with the highest
27 ranked applicant. The Department may undertake negotiations with the next highest
28 ranked applicant in sequence until an agreement is reached or until a determination
29 is made by the Department to reject all applicants.
30 Sec. 11. 1. If the Department enters into a progressive design-build contract
31 with a progressive design-build team pursuant to section 10 of this act, the
32 Department may, after the progressive design-build team has progressed in the
33 design for project, or any portion thereof, in a sufficient manner to determine the
34 cost of the final design and construction of the project, enter into negotiations with
35 the progressive design-build team for a contract or a contract amendment to
36 complete final design and construction of the project, or any portion thereof.
37 2. The progressive design-build team shall develop its price, on a basis
38 determined by the Department and using fully transparent, open-book pricing, to
39 complete the design and construction of the project, or portion thereof.
40 3. If the Department is unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract or contract
41 amendment with the progressive design-build team to complete the final design and
42 construction of the project, or portion thereof, the Department shall terminate
43 negotiations with that progressive design-build team and:
44 (a) May enter into a separate contract with a qualified person who was a
45 member of the progressive design-build team to complete the design of the project,
46 or portion thereof; or
47 (b) May undertake a new procurement and award the contract for the project
48 pursuant to the provisions of NRS 408.327 to 408.387, inclusive, or 408.3875 to
49 408.3888, inclusive. If a new procurement is initiated, the Department may elect
50 not to accept a bid to construct the project from the progressive design-build team
51 with whom the Department entered into a progressive design-build contract for
52 preconstruction services.

18 Department had undertaken the project or had awarded the contract.
19 3. A progressive design-build team to whom a progressive design-build
