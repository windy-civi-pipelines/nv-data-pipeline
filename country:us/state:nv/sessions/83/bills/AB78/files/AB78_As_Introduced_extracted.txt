Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires certain persons and businesses that are importers of
2 liquor, wholesale dealers of beer or wines and liquors, wineries, instructional wine-
3 making facilities, breweries, brew pubs, craft distilleries and estate distilleries to
4 obtain a state license or permit from the Department of Taxation. (NRS 369.180)
5 Under existing law, an applicant for such a license is required to submit an
6 application to: (1) the board of county commissioners of the county in which the
7 applicant maintains his or her principal place of business if the applicant does not
8 maintain his or her principal place of business within the boundaries of an
9 incorporated city; or (2) the governing body of the city in which the applicant
10 maintains his or her principal place of business if the applicant maintains his or her
11 principal place of business within the boundaries of an incorporated city. (NRS
12 369.190) Existing law requires the board of county commissioners or the governing
13 body of the city, as applicable, to approve or disapprove the application and, if the
14 application is approved, forward the application to the Department for review and
15 issuance of the license. (NRS 369.200)
16 Existing law requires the board of county commissioners or the governing body
17 of a city, as applicable, to require satisfactory evidence that an applicant meets
-

– 2 –
18 certain requirements, including that the applicant is not a supplier of alcoholic
19 beverages applying for a license to engage in the business of importing,
20 wholesaling or retailing alcoholic beverages in violation of existing law. (NRS
21 369.190, 369.382) Section 1 of this bill additionally requires the board of county
22 commissioners or the governing body of a city, as applicable, to require satisfactory
23 evidence that an applicant is not an importer or wholesaler of alcoholic beverages
24 applying for a license to engage in another business in violation of existing law
25 governing the distribution of alcoholic beverages. (NRS 597.220)
26 Section 2 of this bill requires the board of county commissioners or the
27 governing body of a city to: (1) determine whether to recommend that an
28 application be approved or disapproved by the Department rather than approve or
29 disapprove applications; and (2) forward to the Department each application, the
30 recommendation and all documents supplied by the applicant which were reviewed
31 by the board or governing body in determining whether to recommend that the
32 application be approved or disapproved.
33 Existing law authorizes the board of county commissioners or the governing
34 body of a city, as applicable, to investigate complaints against a licensee, conduct
35 hearings and recommend to the Department, under certain circumstances, the
36 revocation or suspension of a license. (NRS 369.230-369.290) Sections 3-7 of this
37 bill provide for the Department to also perform these functions in the same manner
38 as a board of county commissioners or governing body of a city and authorize the
39 Department to revoke or suspend a license without receiving a recommendation
40 from a board of county commissioners or governing body of a city. Section 4
41 authorizes the Department, the board of county commissioners or the governing
42 body of a city, as applicable, to extend the time for a licensee to file an answer to a
43 complaint under certain circumstances, and section 6 revises the period within
44 which a decision on the complaint must be rendered if the time for filing an answer
45 is extended. Section 6 also removes the requirement for the Department to suspend
46 or revoke a license upon receiving a recommendation for such action from a board
47 of county commissioners or governing body of a city, and instead authorizes the
48 Department to suspend or revoke a license upon receiving such a recommendation.
49 (NRS 369.260)
50 Existing law authorizes the board of county commissioners or the governing
51 body of a city, as applicable, to suspend or revoke summarily a license in cases
52 where an aggravated and flagrant violation of law appears to have occurred, subject
53 to review by the Department at a hearing. (NRS 369.280) Section 8 of this bill
54 similarly authorizes the Department to suspend or revoke summarily the license of
55 a person in cases where an aggravated and flagrant violation of law appears to have
56 occurred, subject to the same requirements in existing law for notice and a public
57 hearing.
58 Existing law authorizes counties and incorporated cities to license and regulate
59 persons engaged in a business in their jurisdictions related to the distribution or sale
60 of alcoholic beverages. (NRS 244.350, 268.090) Sections 9 and 10 of this bill
61 prohibit counties and cities from issuing a license to a person who is required to
62 obtain a license from the Department unless the Department has issued such a
63 license and the license is in good standing.

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires certain persons and businesses that are importers of
2 liquor, wholesale dealers of beer or wines and liquors, wineries, instructional wine-
3 making facilities, breweries, brew pubs, craft distilleries and estate distilleries to
4 obtain a state license or permit from the Department of Taxation. (NRS 369.180)
5 Under existing law, an applicant for such a license is required to submit an
6 application to: (1) the board of county commissioners of the county in which the
7 applicant maintains his or her principal place of business if the applicant does not
8 maintain his or her principal place of business within the boundaries of an
9 incorporated city; or (2) the governing body of the city in which the applicant
10 maintains his or her principal place of business if the applicant maintains his or her
11 principal place of business within the boundaries of an incorporated city. (NRS
12 369.190) Existing law requires the board of county commissioners or the governing
13 body of the city, as applicable, to approve or disapprove the application and, if the
14 application is approved, forward the application to the Department for review and
15 issuance of the license. (NRS 369.200)
16 Existing law requires the board of county commissioners or the governing body
17 of a city, as applicable, to require satisfactory evidence that an applicant meets

– 2 –
18 certain requirements, including that the applicant is not a supplier of alcoholic
19 beverages applying for a license to engage in the business of importing,
20 wholesaling or retailing alcoholic beverages in violation of existing law. (NRS
21 369.190, 369.382) Section 1 of this bill additionally requires the board of county
22 commissioners or the governing body of a city, as applicable, to require satisfactory
23 evidence that an applicant is not an importer or wholesaler of alcoholic beverages
24 applying for a license to engage in another business in violation of existing law
25 governing the distribution of alcoholic beverages. (NRS 597.220)
26 Section 2 of this bill requires the board of county commissioners or the
27 governing body of a city to: (1) determine whether to recommend that an
28 application be approved or disapproved by the Department rather than approve or
29 disapprove applications; and (2) forward to the Department each application, the
30 recommendation and all documents supplied by the applicant which were reviewed
31 by the board or governing body in determining whether to recommend that the
32 application be approved or disapproved.
33 Existing law authorizes the board of county commissioners or the governing
34 body of a city, as applicable, to investigate complaints against a licensee, conduct
35 hearings and recommend to the Department, under certain circumstances, the
36 revocation or suspension of a license. (NRS 369.230-369.290) Sections 3-7 of this
37 bill provide for the Department to also perform these functions in the same manner
38 as a board of county commissioners or governing body of a city and authorize the
39 Department to revoke or suspend a license without receiving a recommendation
40 from a board of county commissioners or governing body of a city. Section 4
41 authorizes the Department, the board of county commissioners or the governing
42 body of a city, as applicable, to extend the time for a licensee to file an answer to a
43 complaint under certain circumstances, and section 6 revises the period within
44 which a decision on the complaint must be rendered if the time for filing an answer
45 is extended. Section 6 also removes the requirement for the Department to suspend
46 or revoke a license upon receiving a recommendation for such action from a board
47 of county commissioners or governing body of a city, and instead authorizes the
48 Department to suspend or revoke a license upon receiving such a recommendation.
49 (NRS 369.260)
50 Existing law authorizes the board of county commissioners or the governing
51 body of a city, as applicable, to suspend or revoke summarily a license in cases
52 where an aggravated and flagrant violation of law appears to have occurred, subject
53 to review by the Department at a hearing. (NRS 369.280) Section 8 of this bill
54 similarly authorizes the Department to suspend or revoke summarily the license of
55 a person in cases where an aggravated and flagrant violation of law appears to have
56 occurred, subject to the same requirements in existing law for notice and a public
57 hearing.
58 Existing law authorizes counties and incorporated cities to license and regulate
59 persons engaged in a business in their jurisdictions related to the distribution or sale
60 of alcoholic beverages. (NRS 244.350, 268.090) Sections 9 and 10 of this bill
61 prohibit counties and cities from issuing a license to a person who is required to
62 obtain a license from the Department unless the Department has issued such a
63 license and the license is in good standing.
