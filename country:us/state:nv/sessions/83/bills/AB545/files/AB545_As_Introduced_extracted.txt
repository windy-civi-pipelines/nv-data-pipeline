Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the State Environmental Commission, in cooperation with
2 the Department of Motor Vehicles and any local air pollution control agency, to
3 adopt regulations for the control of emissions from motor vehicles in areas
4 designated by the Commission that are in any county whose population is 100,000
5 or more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties). (NRS 445B.770) In such areas,
6 existing law imposes: (1) a fee of $150 for a set of 25 forms certifying emission
7 control compliance; and (2) a fee of $6 per form issued to a fleet station. (NRS
8 445B.830) Additionally, existing law imposes a fee for the first issuance of certain
9 special license plates to vehicles exempted from provisions relating to the control
10 of emissions from motor vehicles, which fee is required to be equal to the fee for a
11 form certifying emission control compliance. (NRS 482.381, 482.3812, 482.3814,
12 482.3816) This bill increases the fee: (1) for each set of 25 forms certifying
13 emission control compliance from $150 to $175; and (2) for each form certifying
14 emission control compliance issued to a fleet station from $6 to $7. Accordingly,
15 this bill also increases the fee for the first issuance of certain special license plates
16 which is tied to the fee for a form certifying emission control compliance.
