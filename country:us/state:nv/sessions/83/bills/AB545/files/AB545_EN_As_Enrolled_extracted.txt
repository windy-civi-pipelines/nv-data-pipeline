Section 1:
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to emissions testing; increasing certain fees
relating to forms certifying emission control compliance; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law requires the State Environmental Commission, in cooperation with
the Department of Motor Vehicles and any local air pollution control agency, to
adopt regulations for the control of emissions from motor vehicles in areas
designated by the Commission that are in any county whose population is 100,000
or more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties). (NRS 445B.770) In such areas,
existing law imposes: (1) a fee of $150 for a set of 25 forms certifying emission
control compliance; and (2) a fee of $6 per form issued to a fleet station. (NRS
445B.830) Additionally, existing law imposes a fee for the first issuance of certain
special license plates to vehicles exempted from provisions relating to the control
of emissions from motor vehicles, which fee is required to be equal to the fee for a
form certifying emission control compliance. (NRS 482.381, 482.3812, 482.3814,

Section 2:
482.3816) This bill increases the fee: (1) for each set of 25 forms certifying
emission control compliance from $150 to $175; and (2) for each form certifying
emission control compliance issued to a fleet station from $6 to $7. Accordingly,
this bill also increases the fee for the first issuance of certain special license plates
which is tied to the fee for a form certifying emission control compliance.
