EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; revising provisions relating to the
Student Loan Repayment for Providers of Health Care in
Underserved Communities Program; renaming the
Program; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates the Student Loan Repayment for Providers of Health Care
2 in Underserved Communities Program to repay the student education loans of
3 qualified providers of health care who work in certain underserved communities.
4 (NRS 226.458) Existing law also creates the Account for Student Loan Repayment
5 for Providers of Health Care in Underserved Communities to be used to repay those
6 student education loans. (NRS 226.466) Existing law defines “provider of health
7 care” for purposes of the Program. (NRS 226.454) Section 4 of this bill adds a
8 licensed speech-language pathologist, physical therapist, occupational therapist,
9 marriage and family therapist, clinical alcohol and drug counselor, alcohol and drug
10 counselor, assistant behavior analyst and behavior analyst and a certified problem
11 gambling counselor to the definition of “provider of health care” for such purposes,
12 thereby expanding the applicability of the Program.
13 Sections 5-7 of this bill also expand the Program to include public health
14 professionals, which are defined in section 1 of this bill as: (1) the Chief Medical
15 Officer and county and district health officers who are appointed under existing
16 law; and (2) a person who is employed by the Division of Public and Behavioral
17 Health of the Department of Health and Human Services or a local board of health
18 in a position for which the Division or local board of health experiences substantial
19 difficulty in recruitment and retention. Such positions are required by section 7 to
20 be designated by regulation by the State Treasurer, based on recommendations that
21 are required to be made by the State Board of Health pursuant to section 9 of this
22 bill. Section 8 of this bill changes the name of the Account for the Program to the
23 Account for Student Loan Repayment for Providers of Health Care and Public
24 Health Professionals in Underserved Communities as a result of the expansion of
-

28 expansion and change of the name of the Program.

SECOND REPRINT A.B. 269
ASSEMBLY BILL NO. 269–ASSEMBLYMEMBER D’SILVA
FEBRUARY 20, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Government Affairs
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to education.
(BDR 18-618)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; revising provisions relating to the
Student Loan Repayment for Providers of Health Care in
Underserved Communities Program; renaming the
Program; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates the Student Loan Repayment for Providers of Health Care
2 in Underserved Communities Program to repay the student education loans of
3 qualified providers of health care who work in certain underserved communities.
4 (NRS 226.458) Existing law also creates the Account for Student Loan Repayment
5 for Providers of Health Care in Underserved Communities to be used to repay those
6 student education loans. (NRS 226.466) Existing law defines “provider of health
7 care” for purposes of the Program. (NRS 226.454) Section 4 of this bill adds a
8 licensed speech-language pathologist, physical therapist, occupational therapist,
9 marriage and family therapist, clinical alcohol and drug counselor, alcohol and drug
10 counselor, assistant behavior analyst and behavior analyst and a certified problem
11 gambling counselor to the definition of “provider of health care” for such purposes,
12 thereby expanding the applicability of the Program.
13 Sections 5-7 of this bill also expand the Program to include public health
14 professionals, which are defined in section 1 of this bill as: (1) the Chief Medical
15 Officer and county and district health officers who are appointed under existing
16 law; and (2) a person who is employed by the Division of Public and Behavioral
17 Health of the Department of Health and Human Services or a local board of health
18 in a position for which the Division or local board of health experiences substantial
19 difficulty in recruitment and retention. Such positions are required by section 7 to
20 be designated by regulation by the State Treasurer, based on recommendations that
21 are required to be made by the State Board of Health pursuant to section 9 of this
22 bill. Section 8 of this bill changes the name of the Account for the Program to the
23 Account for Student Loan Repayment for Providers of Health Care and Public
24 Health Professionals in Underserved Communities as a result of the expansion of
-
*AB269_R2*

– 2 –
25 the Program to include public health professionals. Section 2 of this bill applies the
26 definitions in existing law and section 1 to the provisions of existing law relating to
27 the Program. Section 3 of this bill makes a conforming change as a result of the
28 expansion and change of the name of the Program.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 226 of NRS is hereby amended by adding
