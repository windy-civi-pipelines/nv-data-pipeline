AN ACT relating to education; [expanding the applicability of] revising provisions
relating to the Student Loan Repayment for Providers of Health Care
in Underserved Communities Program; renaming the Program; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates the Student Loan Repayment for Providers of Health Care in
2 Underserved Communities Program to repay the student education loans of qualified
3 providers of health care who work in certain underserved communities. (NRS 226.458)
4 Existing law also creates the Account for Student Loan Repayment for Providers of
5 Health Care in Underserved Communities to be used to repay those student education
6 loans. (NRS 226.466) Existing law defines “provider of health care” for purposes of the
7 Program. (NRS 226.454) Section [1] 4 of this bill adds a licensed speech-language
8 pathologist, physical therapist, marriage and family therapist, clinical alcohol and drug
9 counselor , [and] alcohol and drug counselor , assistant behavior analyst and behavior
10 analyst and a certified problem gambling counselor to the definition of “provider of health
11 care” for such purposes, thereby expanding the applicability of the Program.
12 Existing law prescribes the requirements for a provider of health care to be eligible
13 for repayment of student education loans under the Program, including a requirement
14 that the provider of health care commit to practice for at least 5 years in certain
15 locations. Such locations in existing law include specified census tracts that have
16 populations with lower income levels or have a high level of social vulnerability under
17 certain federal criteria. (NRS 226.460) Section 6 expands eligibility for the Program to a
18 provider of health care who commits to practice for at least 5 years in a census tract that
19 is directly adjacent to a census tract prescribed in existing law as an eligible location
20 under the Program.
21 Sections 5-7 of this bill also expand the Program to include public health
22 professionals, which are defined in section 1 of this bill as: (1) the Chief Medical Officer
23 and county and district health officers who are appointed under existing law; and (2) a
24 person who is employed by the Division of Public and Behavioral Health of the
25 Department of Health and Human Services or a local board of health in a position for
26 which the Division or local board of health experiences substantial difficulty in
27 recruitment and retention. Such positions are required by section 7 to be designated by
28 regulation by the State Treasurer, based on recommendations that are required to be
29 made by the State Board of Health pursuant to section 9 of this bill. Section 8 of this bill
30 changes the name of the Account for the Program to the Account for Student Loan
31 Repayment for Providers of Health Care and Public Health Professionals in

Assembly Amendment No. 13 to Assembly Bill No. 269 Page 4
32 Underserved Communities as a result of the expansion of the Program to include public
33 health professionals. Section 2 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law and
34 section 1 to the provisions of existing law relating to the Program. Section 3 of this bill
35 makes a conforming change as a result of the expansion and change of the name of the
36 Program.
