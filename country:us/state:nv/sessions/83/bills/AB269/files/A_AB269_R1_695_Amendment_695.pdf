AN ACT relating to education; revising provisions relating to the Student Loan
Repayment for Providers of Health Care in Underserved Communities
Program; renaming the Program; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates the Student Loan Repayment for Providers of Health Care in
2 Underserved Communities Program to repay the student education loans of qualified
3 providers of health care who work in certain underserved communities. (NRS 226.458)
4 Existing law also creates the Account for Student Loan Repayment for Providers of Health
5 Care in Underserved Communities to be used to repay those student education loans. (NRS
6 226.466) Existing law defines “provider of health care” for purposes of the Program. (NRS
7 226.454) Section 4 of this bill adds a licensed speech-language pathologist, physical therapist,
8 occupational therapist, marriage and family therapist, clinical alcohol and drug counselor,
9 alcohol and drug counselor, assistant behavior analyst and behavior analyst and a certified
10 problem gambling counselor to the definition of “provider of health care” for such purposes,
11 thereby expanding the applicability of the Program.
12 [Existing law prescribes the requirements for a provider of health care to be eligible for
13 repayment of student education loans under the Program, including a requirement that the
14 provider of health care commit to practice for at least 5 years in certain locations. Such
15 locations in existing law include specified census tracts that have populations with lower
16 income levels or have a high level of social vulnerability under certain federal criteria. (NRS
17 226.460) Section 6 expands eligibility for the Program to a provider of health care who
18 commits to practice for at least 5 years in a census tract that is directly adjacent to a census
19 tract prescribed in existing law as an eligible location under the Program.]
20 Sections 5-7 of this bill also expand the Program to include public health professionals,
21 which are defined in section 1 of this bill as: (1) the Chief Medical Officer and county and
22 district health officers who are appointed under existing law; and (2) a person who is
23 employed by the Division of Public and Behavioral Health of the Department of Health and
24 Human Services or a local board of health in a position for which the Division or local board
25 of health experiences substantial difficulty in recruitment and retention. Such positions are
26 required by section 7 to be designated by regulation by the State Treasurer, based on
27 recommendations that are required to be made by the State Board of Health pursuant to
28 section 9 of this bill. Section 8 of this bill changes the name of the Account for the Program
29 to the Account for Student Loan Repayment for Providers of Health Care and Public Health
30 Professionals in Underserved Communities as a result of the expansion of the Program to
31 include public health professionals. Section 2 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law

Senate Amendment No. 695 to Assembly Bill No. 269 First Reprint Page 4
32 and section 1 to the provisions of existing law relating to the Program. Section 3 of this bill
33 makes a conforming change as a result of the expansion and change of the name of the
34 Program.
