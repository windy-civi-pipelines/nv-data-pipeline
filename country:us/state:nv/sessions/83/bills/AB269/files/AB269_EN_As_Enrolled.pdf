Assembly Bill No. 269–Assemblymember D’Silva
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to education; revising provisions relating to the
Student Loan Repayment for Providers of Health Care in
Underserved Communities Program; renaming the Program;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law creates the Student Loan Repayment for Providers of Health Care
in Underserved Communities Program to repay the student education loans of
qualified providers of health care who work in certain underserved communities.
(NRS 226.458) Existing law also creates the Account for Student Loan Repayment
for Providers of Health Care in Underserved Communities to be used to repay those
student education loans. (NRS 226.466) Existing law defines “provider of health
care” for purposes of the Program. (NRS 226.454) Section 4 of this bill adds a
licensed speech-language pathologist, physical therapist, occupational therapist,
marriage and family therapist, clinical alcohol and drug counselor, alcohol and drug
counselor, assistant behavior analyst and behavior analyst and a certified problem
gambling counselor to the definition of “provider of health care” for such purposes,
thereby expanding the applicability of the Program.
Sections 5-7 of this bill also expand the Program to include public health
professionals, which are defined in section 1 of this bill as: (1) the Chief Medical
Officer and county and district health officers who are appointed under existing
law; and (2) a person who is employed by the Division of Public and Behavioral
Health of the Department of Health and Human Services or a local board of health
in a position for which the Division or local board of health experiences substantial
difficulty in recruitment and retention. Such positions are required by section 7 to
be designated by regulation by the State Treasurer, based on recommendations that
are required to be made by the State Board of Health pursuant to section 9 of this
bill. Section 8 of this bill changes the name of the Account for the Program to the
Account for Student Loan Repayment for Providers of Health Care and Public
Health Professionals in Underserved Communities as a result of the expansion of
the Program to include public health professionals. Section 2 of this bill applies the
definitions in existing law and section 1 to the provisions of existing law relating to
the Program. Section 3 of this bill makes a conforming change as a result of the
expansion and change of the name of the Program.
