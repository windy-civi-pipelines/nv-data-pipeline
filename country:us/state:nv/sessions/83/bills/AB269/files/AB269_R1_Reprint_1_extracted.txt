(BDR 18-618)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; revising provisions relating to the
Student Loan Repayment for Providers of Health Care in
Underserved Communities Program; renaming the
Program; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates the Student Loan Repayment for Providers of Health Care
2 in Underserved Communities Program to repay the student education loans of
3 qualified providers of health care who work in certain underserved communities.
4 (NRS 226.458) Existing law also creates the Account for Student Loan Repayment
5 for Providers of Health Care in Underserved Communities to be used to repay those
6 student education loans. (NRS 226.466) Existing law defines “provider of health
7 care” for purposes of the Program. (NRS 226.454) Section 4 of this bill adds a
8 licensed speech-language pathologist, physical therapist, marriage and family
9 therapist, clinical alcohol and drug counselor, alcohol and drug counselor, assistant
10 behavior analyst and behavior analyst and a certified problem gambling counselor
11 to the definition of “provider of health care” for such purposes, thereby expanding
12 the applicability of the Program.
13 Existing law prescribes the requirements for a provider of health care to be
14 eligible for repayment of student education loans under the Program, including a
15 requirement that the provider of health care commit to practice for at least 5 years
16 in certain locations. Such locations in existing law include specified census tracts
17 that have populations with lower income levels or have a high level of social
18 vulnerability under certain federal criteria. (NRS 226.460) Section 6 expands
19 eligibility for the Program to a provider of health care who commits to practice for
20 at least 5 years in a census tract that is directly adjacent to a census tract prescribed
21 in existing law as an eligible location under the Program.
22 Sections 5-7 of this bill also expand the Program to include public health
23 professionals, which are defined in section 1 of this bill as: (1) the Chief Medical
24 Officer and county and district health officers who are appointed under existing
-
*AB269_R1*
– 2 –
25 law; and (2) a person who is employed by the Division of Public and Behavioral
26 Health of the Department of Health and Human Services or a local board of health
27 in a position for which the Division or local board of health experiences substantial
28 difficulty in recruitment and retention. Such positions are required by section 7 to
29 be designated by regulation by the State Treasurer, based on recommendations that
30 are required to be made by the State Board of Health pursuant to section 9 of this
31 bill. Section 8 of this bill changes the name of the Account for the Program to the
32 Account for Student Loan Repayment for Providers of Health Care and Public
33 Health Professionals in Underserved Communities as a result of the expansion of
34 the Program to include public health professionals. Section 2 of this bill applies the
35 definitions in existing law and section 1 to the provisions of existing law relating to
36 the Program. Section 3 of this bill makes a conforming change as a result of the
37 expansion and change of the name of the Program.

FIRST REPRINT A.B. 269
ASSEMBLY BILL NO. 269–ASSEMBLYMEMBER D’SILVA
FEBRUARY 20, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Government Affairs
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to education.
(BDR 18-618)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; revising provisions relating to the
Student Loan Repayment for Providers of Health Care in
Underserved Communities Program; renaming the
Program; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates the Student Loan Repayment for Providers of Health Care
2 in Underserved Communities Program to repay the student education loans of
3 qualified providers of health care who work in certain underserved communities.
4 (NRS 226.458) Existing law also creates the Account for Student Loan Repayment
5 for Providers of Health Care in Underserved Communities to be used to repay those
6 student education loans. (NRS 226.466) Existing law defines “provider of health
7 care” for purposes of the Program. (NRS 226.454) Section 4 of this bill adds a
8 licensed speech-language pathologist, physical therapist, marriage and family
9 therapist, clinical alcohol and drug counselor, alcohol and drug counselor, assistant
10 behavior analyst and behavior analyst and a certified problem gambling counselor
11 to the definition of “provider of health care” for such purposes, thereby expanding
12 the applicability of the Program.
13 Existing law prescribes the requirements for a provider of health care to be
14 eligible for repayment of student education loans under the Program, including a
15 requirement that the provider of health care commit to practice for at least 5 years
16 in certain locations. Such locations in existing law include specified census tracts
17 that have populations with lower income levels or have a high level of social
18 vulnerability under certain federal criteria. (NRS 226.460) Section 6 expands
19 eligibility for the Program to a provider of health care who commits to practice for
20 at least 5 years in a census tract that is directly adjacent to a census tract prescribed
21 in existing law as an eligible location under the Program.
22 Sections 5-7 of this bill also expand the Program to include public health
23 professionals, which are defined in section 1 of this bill as: (1) the Chief Medical
