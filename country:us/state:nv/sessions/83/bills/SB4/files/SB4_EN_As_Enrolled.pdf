Senate Bill No. 4–Committee on Judiciary
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to adoption; authorizing certain caseworkers to
attest to a consent to a specific adoption under certain
circumstances; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law establishes provisions governing the adoption of children. (NRS
127.010-127.1869) Existing law authorizes an adult to petition a court for the
adoption of a child and requires written consent to the specific adoption proposed
by the petition from each legal parent of the child and any legal guardian of the
child. (NRS 127.030, 127.040) Under existing law: (1) at least two witnesses must
attest to the consent to a specific adoption; and (2) if neither the petitioner nor the
spouse of the petitioner is related to the child within the third degree of
consanguinity, at least one of the two witnesses must be a social worker employed
by certain agencies. (NRS 127.053) Section 1 of this bill revises this requirement
by specifying that, in such cases, at least one of the two witnesses must be either a
social worker or a caseworker employed by certain agencies.
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
