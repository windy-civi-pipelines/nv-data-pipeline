EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to adoption; authorizing certain caseworkers to
attest to a consent to a specific adoption under certain
circumstances; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes provisions governing the adoption of children. (NRS
2 127.010-127.1869) Existing law authorizes an adult to petition a court for the
3 adoption of a child and requires written consent to the specific adoption proposed
4 by the petition from each legal parent of the child and any legal guardian of the
5 child. (NRS 127.030, 127.040) Under existing law: (1) at least two witnesses must
6 attest to the consent to a specific adoption; and (2) if neither the petitioner nor the
7 spouse of the petitioner is related to the child within the third degree of
8 consanguinity, at least one of the two witnesses must be a social worker employed
9 by certain agencies. (NRS 127.053) Section 1 of this bill revises this requirement
10 by specifying that, in such cases, at least one of the two witnesses must be either a
11 social worker or a caseworker employed by certain agencies.
