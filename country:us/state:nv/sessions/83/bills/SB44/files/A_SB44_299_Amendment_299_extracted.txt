AN ACT relating to financial services; imposing certain duties on providers of
certain financial services relating to the safeguarding of customer
information; establishing certain standards relating to the financial
condition and corporate governance of certain mortgage servicers;
requiring the Commissioner of Mortgage Lending and the
Commissioner of Financial Institutions to adopt certain regulations;
providing penalties; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing federal regulations set forth standards for the safeguarding of customer
2 information by certain businesses over which the Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction
3 that are engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to such financial
4 activities. (16 C.F.R. Part 314) The standards require such businesses to, among other things:
5 (1) develop, implement and maintain a comprehensive information security program; and (2)
6 notify the Federal Trade Commission of certain unauthorized acquisitions of customer
7 information, which existing federal regulations designate as a “notification event.” (16 C.F.R.
8 §§ 314.2-312.4). Sections 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 38-41 and 43-47 of this bill specifically require
9 persons that are providers of certain financial services in this State to comply with the
10 requirements set forth in those federal regulations. Additionally, sections 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 38-41
11 and 43-47 require such a person to: (1) maintain the information security program required by
12 existing federal regulations as part of the books and records of the person; and (2) notify the
13 Commissioner of Financial Institutions or Commissioner of Mortgage Lending, as applicable,
14 of any notification event in accordance with the regulations adopted by the applicable
15 commissioner. The persons to which the requirements apply include private professional
16 guardians and private professional guardian companies, escrow agents and escrow agencies,
17 mortgage companies, mortgage loan originators, mortgage servicers, foreclosure consultants,
18 foreclosure purchasers, loan modification consultants, persons performing covered services
19 for compensation, collection agencies and collection agents, persons operating deferred
20 deposit loan services, high-interest loan services, title loan services and check-cashing
Senate Amendment No. 299 to Senate Bill No. 44 Page 4
21 services, consumer litigation funding companies, providers of earned wage access services,
22 trust companies, student loan servicers, private education lenders, money transmitters and
23 their authorized delegates, installment lenders and providers of debt-management services.
24 Sections 3, 5, 32 and 42 of this bill require the Commissioner of Mortgage Lending and the
25 Commissioner of Financial Institutions, as applicable, to adopt regulations establishing
26 procedures and requirements for notifying the applicable commissioner of a notification event
27 pursuant to sections 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 38-41 and 43-47.
28 Section 33 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law that govern foreclosure
29 consultants, foreclosure purchasers, loan modification consultants and persons performing
30 covered services for compensation to the provisions of section 7. Section 34 of this bill
31 provides that the provisions of section 7 do not apply to certain persons.
32 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of mortgage servicers by the
33 Commissioner of Mortgage Lending. (NRS 645F.500-645F.540) Sections 9-31 of this bill set
34 forth certain standards for the financial condition and corporate governance of certain
35 mortgage servicers which are modeled, in general, after the Model State Regulatory Prudential
36 Standards for Nonbank Mortgage Servicers approved by the Conference of State Bank
37 Supervisors. Under sections 26 and 35 of this bill, the standards apply, with certain
38 exceptions, to a “covered institution” which is defined in section 13 to mean, in general, a
39 mortgage servicer that: (1) services 2,000 or more residential mortgage loans; and (2) operates
40 in two or more states, districts or territories of the United States. Section 26 requires a covered
41 institution to: (1) maintain certain quantities of assets for liquidity; and (2) have in place
42 sound cash management and business operating plans. Section 27 requires a covered
43 institution to establish and maintain a board of directors or similar body. Section 28 imposes
44 certain duties on a board of directors or similar body relating to corporate governance and
45 internal audits. Section 29 requires a covered institution to obtain an annual external audit.
46 Section 30 requires a covered institution to: (1) establish a risk management program meeting
47 certain requirements; (2) conduct an annual risk management assessment; and (3) maintain
48 evidence of activities to manage risk performed throughout the year. Section 31 authorizes the
49 Commissioner, under certain circumstances, to: (1) require a covered institution to satisfy
50 additional conditions; and (2) waive or temporarily suspend any or all of the requirements set
51 forth in sections 9-31. Sections 9-24 define words and terms for the purposes of sections 9-
52 31.
53 Section 36 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner of Mortgage Lending to adopt
54 regulations to carry out the provisions requiring compliance with the standards for the
55 safeguarding of customer information and the standards for the financial condition and
56 corporate governance of certain mortgage servicers. Section 37 of this bill authorizes the
57 Commissioner to: (1) investigate a mortgage servicer or applicant for a license as a mortgage
58 servicer to ensure compliance with those provisions; and (2) take certain disciplinary actions
59 against a mortgage servicer or applicant for a license as a mortgage servicer who violates
60 those provisions.

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to financial services; imposing certain duties on providers of
certain financial services relating to the safeguarding of customer
information; establishing certain standards relating to the financial
condition and corporate governance of certain mortgage servicers;
requiring the Commissioner of Mortgage Lending and the
Commissioner of Financial Institutions to adopt certain regulations;
providing penalties; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing federal regulations set forth standards for the safeguarding of customer
2 information by certain businesses over which the Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction
3 that are engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to such financial
4 activities. (16 C.F.R. Part 314) The standards require such businesses to, among other things:
5 (1) develop, implement and maintain a comprehensive information security program; and (2)
6 notify the Federal Trade Commission of certain unauthorized acquisitions of customer
7 information, which existing federal regulations designate as a “notification event.” (16 C.F.R.
8 §§ 314.2-312.4). Sections 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 38-41 and 43-47 of this bill specifically require
9 persons that are providers of certain financial services in this State to comply with the
10 requirements set forth in those federal regulations. Additionally, sections 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 38-41
11 and 43-47 require such a person to: (1) maintain the information security program required by
12 existing federal regulations as part of the books and records of the person; and (2) notify the
13 Commissioner of Financial Institutions or Commissioner of Mortgage Lending, as applicable,
14 of any notification event in accordance with the regulations adopted by the applicable
15 commissioner. The persons to which the requirements apply include private professional
16 guardians and private professional guardian companies, escrow agents and escrow agencies,
17 mortgage companies, mortgage loan originators, mortgage servicers, foreclosure consultants,
18 foreclosure purchasers, loan modification consultants, persons performing covered services
19 for compensation, collection agencies and collection agents, persons operating deferred
20 deposit loan services, high-interest loan services, title loan services and check-cashing

Senate Amendment No. 299 to Senate Bill No. 44 Page 4
21 services, consumer litigation funding companies, providers of earned wage access services,
22 trust companies, student loan servicers, private education lenders, money transmitters and
23 their authorized delegates, installment lenders and providers of debt-management services.
24 Sections 3, 5, 32 and 42 of this bill require the Commissioner of Mortgage Lending and the
25 Commissioner of Financial Institutions, as applicable, to adopt regulations establishing
26 procedures and requirements for notifying the applicable commissioner of a notification event
27 pursuant to sections 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 38-41 and 43-47.
28 Section 33 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law that govern foreclosure
29 consultants, foreclosure purchasers, loan modification consultants and persons performing
30 covered services for compensation to the provisions of section 7. Section 34 of this bill
31 provides that the provisions of section 7 do not apply to certain persons.
32 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of mortgage servicers by the
33 Commissioner of Mortgage Lending. (NRS 645F.500-645F.540) Sections 9-31 of this bill set
34 forth certain standards for the financial condition and corporate governance of certain
35 mortgage servicers which are modeled, in general, after the Model State Regulatory Prudential
36 Standards for Nonbank Mortgage Servicers approved by the Conference of State Bank
37 Supervisors. Under sections 26 and 35 of this bill, the standards apply, with certain
38 exceptions, to a “covered institution” which is defined in section 13 to mean, in general, a
39 mortgage servicer that: (1) services 2,000 or more residential mortgage loans; and (2) operates
40 in two or more states, districts or territories of the United States. Section 26 requires a covered
41 institution to: (1) maintain certain quantities of assets for liquidity; and (2) have in place
42 sound cash management and business operating plans. Section 27 requires a covered
43 institution to establish and maintain a board of directors or similar body. Section 28 imposes
44 certain duties on a board of directors or similar body relating to corporate governance and
45 internal audits. Section 29 requires a covered institution to obtain an annual external audit.
46 Section 30 requires a covered institution to: (1) establish a risk management program meeting
47 certain requirements; (2) conduct an annual risk management assessment; and (3) maintain
48 evidence of activities to manage risk performed throughout the year. Section 31 authorizes the
49 Commissioner, under certain circumstances, to: (1) require a covered institution to satisfy
50 additional conditions; and (2) waive or temporarily suspend any or all of the requirements set
51 forth in sections 9-31. Sections 9-24 define words and terms for the purposes of sections 9-
52 31.
53 Section 36 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner of Mortgage Lending to adopt
54 regulations to carry out the provisions requiring compliance with the standards for the
55 safeguarding of customer information and the standards for the financial condition and
56 corporate governance of certain mortgage servicers. Section 37 of this bill authorizes the
57 Commissioner to: (1) investigate a mortgage servicer or applicant for a license as a mortgage
58 servicer to ensure compliance with those provisions; and (2) take certain disciplinary actions
59 against a mortgage servicer or applicant for a license as a mortgage servicer who violates
60 those provisions.
