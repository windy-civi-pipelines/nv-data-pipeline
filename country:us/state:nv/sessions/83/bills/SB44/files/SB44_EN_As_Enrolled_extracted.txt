safeguarding of customer information; establishing certain
standards relating to the financial condition and corporate
governance of certain mortgage servicers; requiring the
Commissioner of Mortgage Lending and the Commissioner
of Financial Institutions to adopt certain regulations;
providing penalties; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing federal regulations set forth standards for the safeguarding of customer
information by certain businesses over which the Federal Trade Commission has
jurisdiction that are engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to
such financial activities. (16 C.F.R. Part 314) The standards require such businesses
to, among other things: (1) develop, implement and maintain a comprehensive
information security program; and (2) notify the Federal Trade Commission of
certain unauthorized acquisitions of customer information, which existing federal
regulations designate as a “notification event.” (16 C.F.R. §§ 314.2-312.4) Sections
1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 38-41 and 43-47 of this bill specifically require persons that are
providers of certain financial services in this State to comply with the requirements
set forth in those federal regulations. Additionally, sections 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 38-41 and
43-47 require such a person to: (1) maintain the information security program
required by existing federal regulations as part of the books and records of the
person; and (2) notify the Commissioner of Financial Institutions or Commissioner
of Mortgage Lending, as applicable, of any notification event in accordance with
the regulations adopted by the applicable commissioner. The persons to which the
requirements apply include private professional guardians and private professional
guardian companies, escrow agents and escrow agencies, mortgage companies,
mortgage loan originators, mortgage servicers, foreclosure consultants, foreclosure
purchasers, loan modification consultants, persons performing covered services for
compensation, collection agencies and collection agents, persons operating deferred
deposit loan services, high-interest loan services, title loan services and check-
cashing services, consumer litigation funding companies, providers of earned wage
access services, trust companies, student loan servicers, private education lenders,
money transmitters and their authorized delegates, installment lenders and
providers of debt-management services. Sections 3, 5, 32 and 42 of this bill require
the Commissioner of Mortgage Lending and the Commissioner of Financial
Institutions, as applicable, to adopt regulations establishing procedures and
requirements for notifying the applicable commissioner of a notification event
pursuant to sections 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 38-41 and 43-47.

Section 2:
Section 33 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law that govern
foreclosure consultants, foreclosure purchasers, loan modification consultants and
persons performing covered services for compensation to the provisions of section

Section 3:
7. Section 34 of this bill provides that the provisions of section 7 do not apply to
certain persons.
Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of mortgage servicers by
the Commissioner of Mortgage Lending. (NRS 645F.500-645F.540) Sections 9-31
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 2 –
of this bill set forth certain standards for the financial condition and corporate
governance of certain mortgage servicers which are modeled, in general, after the
Model State Regulatory Prudential Standards for Nonbank Mortgage Servicers
approved by the Conference of State Bank Supervisors. Under sections 26 and 35
of this bill, the standards apply, with certain exceptions, to a “covered institution”
which is defined in section 13 to mean, in general, a mortgage servicer that: (1)
services 2,000 or more residential mortgage loans; and (2) operates in two or more
states, districts or territories of the United States. Section 26 requires a covered
institution to: (1) maintain certain quantities of assets for liquidity; and (2) have in
place sound cash management and business operating plans. Section 27 requires a
covered institution to establish and maintain a board of directors or similar body.

Section 4:
Section 28 imposes certain duties on a board of directors or similar body relating to
corporate governance and internal audits. Section 29 requires a covered institution
to obtain an annual external audit. Section 30 requires a covered institution to: (1)
establish a risk management program meeting certain requirements; (2) conduct an
annual risk management assessment; and (3) maintain evidence of activities to
manage risk performed throughout the year. Section 31 authorizes the
Commissioner, under certain circumstances, to: (1) require a covered institution to
satisfy additional conditions; and (2) waive or temporarily suspend any or all of the
requirements set forth in sections 9-31. Sections 9-24 define words and terms for
the purposes of sections 9-31.

Section 5:
Section 36 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner of Mortgage Lending to
adopt regulations to carry out the provisions requiring compliance with the
standards for the safeguarding of customer information and the standards for the
financial condition and corporate governance of certain mortgage servicers. Section
37 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner to: (1) investigate a mortgage servicer
or applicant for a license as a mortgage servicer to ensure compliance with those
provisions; and (2) take certain disciplinary actions against a mortgage servicer or
applicant for a license as a mortgage servicer who violates those provisions.

Senate Bill No. 44–Committee on Commerce and Labor
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to financial services; imposing certain duties on
providers of certain financial services relating to the
safeguarding of customer information; establishing certain
standards relating to the financial condition and corporate
governance of certain mortgage servicers; requiring the
Commissioner of Mortgage Lending and the Commissioner
of Financial Institutions to adopt certain regulations;
providing penalties; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing federal regulations set forth standards for the safeguarding of customer
information by certain businesses over which the Federal Trade Commission has
jurisdiction that are engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to
such financial activities. (16 C.F.R. Part 314) The standards require such businesses
to, among other things: (1) develop, implement and maintain a comprehensive
information security program; and (2) notify the Federal Trade Commission of
certain unauthorized acquisitions of customer information, which existing federal
regulations designate as a “notification event.” (16 C.F.R. §§ 314.2-312.4) Sections
1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 38-41 and 43-47 of this bill specifically require persons that are
providers of certain financial services in this State to comply with the requirements
set forth in those federal regulations. Additionally, sections 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 38-41 and
43-47 require such a person to: (1) maintain the information security program
required by existing federal regulations as part of the books and records of the
person; and (2) notify the Commissioner of Financial Institutions or Commissioner
of Mortgage Lending, as applicable, of any notification event in accordance with
the regulations adopted by the applicable commissioner. The persons to which the
requirements apply include private professional guardians and private professional
guardian companies, escrow agents and escrow agencies, mortgage companies,
mortgage loan originators, mortgage servicers, foreclosure consultants, foreclosure
purchasers, loan modification consultants, persons performing covered services for
compensation, collection agencies and collection agents, persons operating deferred
deposit loan services, high-interest loan services, title loan services and check-
cashing services, consumer litigation funding companies, providers of earned wage
access services, trust companies, student loan servicers, private education lenders,
money transmitters and their authorized delegates, installment lenders and
providers of debt-management services. Sections 3, 5, 32 and 42 of this bill require
the Commissioner of Mortgage Lending and the Commissioner of Financial
Institutions, as applicable, to adopt regulations establishing procedures and
requirements for notifying the applicable commissioner of a notification event
pursuant to sections 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 38-41 and 43-47.
Section 33 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law that govern
foreclosure consultants, foreclosure purchasers, loan modification consultants and
persons performing covered services for compensation to the provisions of section
7. Section 34 of this bill provides that the provisions of section 7 do not apply to
certain persons.
Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of mortgage servicers by
the Commissioner of Mortgage Lending. (NRS 645F.500-645F.540) Sections 9-31
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 2 –
of this bill set forth certain standards for the financial condition and corporate
governance of certain mortgage servicers which are modeled, in general, after the
Model State Regulatory Prudential Standards for Nonbank Mortgage Servicers
approved by the Conference of State Bank Supervisors. Under sections 26 and 35
of this bill, the standards apply, with certain exceptions, to a “covered institution”
which is defined in section 13 to mean, in general, a mortgage servicer that: (1)
services 2,000 or more residential mortgage loans; and (2) operates in two or more
states, districts or territories of the United States. Section 26 requires a covered
institution to: (1) maintain certain quantities of assets for liquidity; and (2) have in
place sound cash management and business operating plans. Section 27 requires a
covered institution to establish and maintain a board of directors or similar body.
Section 28 imposes certain duties on a board of directors or similar body relating to
corporate governance and internal audits. Section 29 requires a covered institution
to obtain an annual external audit. Section 30 requires a covered institution to: (1)
establish a risk management program meeting certain requirements; (2) conduct an
annual risk management assessment; and (3) maintain evidence of activities to
manage risk performed throughout the year. Section 31 authorizes the
Commissioner, under certain circumstances, to: (1) require a covered institution to
satisfy additional conditions; and (2) waive or temporarily suspend any or all of the
requirements set forth in sections 9-31. Sections 9-24 define words and terms for
the purposes of sections 9-31.
Section 36 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner of Mortgage Lending to
adopt regulations to carry out the provisions requiring compliance with the
standards for the safeguarding of customer information and the standards for the
financial condition and corporate governance of certain mortgage servicers. Section
37 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner to: (1) investigate a mortgage servicer
or applicant for a license as a mortgage servicer to ensure compliance with those
provisions; and (2) take certain disciplinary actions against a mortgage servicer or
applicant for a license as a mortgage servicer who violates those provisions.
