certain standards relating to the financial condition and
corporate governance of certain mortgage servicers;
requiring the Commissioner of Mortgage Lending and the
Commissioner of Financial Institutions to adopt certain
regulations; providing penalties; and providing other

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing federal regulations set forth standards for the safeguarding of customer
2 information by certain businesses over which the Federal Trade Commission has
3 jurisdiction that are engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to
4 such financial activities. (16 C.F.R. Part 314) The standards require such businesses
5 to, among other things: (1) develop, implement and maintain a comprehensive
6 information security program; and (2) notify the Federal Trade Commission of
7 certain unauthorized acquisitions of customer information, which existing federal
8 regulations designate as a “notification event.” (16 C.F.R. §§ 314.2-312.4).
9 Sections 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 38-41 and 43-47 of this bill specifically require persons that
10 are providers of certain financial services in this State to comply with the
11 requirements set forth in those federal regulations. Additionally, sections 1, 2, 4, 7,
12 8, 38-41 and 43-47 require such a person to: (1) maintain the information security
13 program required by existing federal regulations as part of the books and records of

14 the person; and (2) notify the Commissioner of Financial Institutions or
15 Commissioner of Mortgage Lending, as applicable, of any notification event in
16 accordance with the regulations adopted by the applicable commissioner. The
17 persons to which the requirements apply include private professional guardians and
18 private professional guardian companies, escrow agents and escrow agencies,
19 mortgage companies, mortgage loan originators, mortgage servicers, foreclosure
20 consultants, foreclosure purchasers, loan modification consultants, persons
21 performing covered services for compensation, collection agencies and collection
22 agents, persons operating deferred deposit loan services, high-interest loan services,
23 title loan services and check-cashing services, consumer litigation funding
24 companies, providers of earned wage access services, trust companies, student loan
25 servicers, private education lenders, money transmitters and their authorized
26 delegates, installment lenders and providers of debt-management services. Sections
27 3, 5, 32 and 42 of this bill require the Commissioner of Mortgage Lending and the
28 Commissioner of Financial Institutions, as applicable, to adopt regulations
29 establishing procedures and requirements for notifying the applicable commissioner
30 of a notification event pursuant to sections 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 38-41 and 43-47.
31 Section 33 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law that govern
32 foreclosure consultants, foreclosure purchasers, loan modification consultants and
33 persons performing covered services for compensation to the provisions of section
34 7. Section 34 of this bill provides that the provisions of section 7 do not apply to
35 certain persons.
36 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of mortgage servicers by
37 the Commissioner of Mortgage Lending. (NRS 645F.500-645F.540) Sections 9-31
38 of this bill set forth certain standards for the financial condition and corporate
39 governance of certain mortgage servicers which are modeled, in general, after the
40 Model State Regulatory Prudential Standards for Nonbank Mortgage Servicers
41 approved by the Conference of State Bank Supervisors. Under sections 26 and 35
42 of this bill, the standards apply, with certain exceptions, to a “covered institution”
43 which is defined in section 13 to mean, in general, a mortgage servicer that: (1)
44 services 2,000 or more residential mortgage loans; and (2) operates in two or more
45 states, districts or territories of the United States. Section 26 requires a covered
46 institution to: (1) maintain certain quantities of assets for liquidity; and (2) have in
47 place sound cash management and business operating plans. Section 27 requires a
48 covered institution to establish and maintain a board of directors or similar body.
49 Section 28 imposes certain duties on a board of directors or similar body relating to
50 corporate governance and internal audits. Section 29 requires a covered institution
51 to obtain an annual external audit. Section 30 requires a covered institution to: (1)
52 establish a risk management program meeting certain requirements; (2) conduct an
53 annual risk management assessment; and (3) maintain evidence of activities to
54 manage risk performed throughout the year. Section 31 authorizes the
55 Commissioner, under certain circumstances, to: (1) require a covered institution to
56 satisfy additional conditions; and (2) waive or temporarily suspend any or all of the
57 requirements set forth in sections 9-31. Sections 9-24 define words and terms for
58 the purposes of sections 9-31.
59 Section 36 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner of Mortgage Lending to
60 adopt regulations to carry out the provisions requiring compliance with the
61 standards for the safeguarding of customer information and the standards for the
62 financial condition and corporate governance of certain mortgage servicers. Section
63 37 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner to: (1) investigate a mortgage servicer
64 or applicant for a license as a mortgage servicer to ensure compliance with those
65 provisions; and (2) take certain disciplinary actions against a mortgage servicer or
66 applicant for a license as a mortgage servicer who violates those provisions.
