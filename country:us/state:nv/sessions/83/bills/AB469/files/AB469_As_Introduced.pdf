Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes the Nevada Industrial Insurance Act and the Nevada
2 Occupational Diseases Act, which: (1) provide for the payment of compensation to
3 employees who are injured or disabled as the result of an occupational injury or
4 occupational disease; and (2) govern industrial insurers in this State that provide
5 benefits to those employees. (Chapters 616A-616D and 617 of NRS) Existing law
6 authorizes certain groups of public or private employers to act as an association of
7 self-insured employers if the group and each employer within the group meet
8 certain requirements. (NRS 616B.350-616B.446) Existing law requires a board of
9 trustees to operate any such association and to employ: (1) an association’s
10 administrator to carry out the policies of the board and perform such duties as the
11 board delegates; and (2) a third-party administrator to administer the plan of
12 insurance of the association. Existing law prohibits an association’s administrator
13 from performing any of the duties assigned to the third-party administrator.

14 (NRS 616B.365) Section 2 of this bill specifies that the association’s administrator
15 is prohibited from directly administering claims. Existing law also prohibits the
16 association’s administrator and the third-party administrator from having a direct or
17 indirect financial interest in each other. (NRS 616B.371) Section 3 of this bill
18 removes the prohibition on the association’s administrator and the third-party
19 administrator from having a financial interest in each other. Section 1 of this bill
20 revises the definition of the term “association’s administrator” to specify that the
21 responsibilities of the association’s administrator to carry out the daily operations
22 of the association are at the direction of the board of trustees of the association.
23 Existing law establishes the Fund for Workers’ Compensation and Safety
24 within the State Treasury. (NRS 616A.425) Existing law creates within the Fund a
25 Subsequent Injury Account for each of the following insurers: (1) self-insured
26 employers; (2) associations of self-insured public or private employers; and (3)
27 private carriers. (NRS 616B.554, 616B.575, 616B.584) Existing law requires that
28 money in the Accounts be used to provide compensation or reimbursement in
29 situations where an employee who has a preexisting permanent physical
30 impairment incurs a subsequent disability by an injury arising out of and in the
31 course of employment which entitles the employee to compensation for the
32 combined disability that is substantially greater than that which would have resulted
33 from the subsequent injury alone. (NRS 616B.557, 616B.560, 616B.578) Existing
34 law requires either a board for administration or the Administrator of the Division
35 of Industrial Relations of the Department of Business and Industry to administer
36 each Account. (NRS 616B.548, 616B.554, 616B.569, 616B.575, 616B.584)
37 Existing law and regulations require self-insured employers, associations of self-
38 insured public or private employers and private carriers to pay an annual
39 assessment to fund the Accounts. (NRS 616B.554, 616B.575, 616B.584; chapter
40 616B of NAC)
41 Sections 4, 7 and 10 of this bill remove the authority to adopt regulations
42 which impose such assessments from each board for administration and the
43 Administrator of the Division, and section 32 of this bill voids the provisions of
44 existing regulations relating to such assessments, thus eliminating the requirement
45 for assessments to be paid for each Account. Sections 5, 6, 8, 9, 11 and 12 of this
46 bill require, for compensation or reimbursement provisions to apply, an employee
47 to have incurred a subsequent disability by injury on or before September 30, 2025,
48 thus prohibiting any claims against the Accounts due to a subsequent disability by
49 injury which is incurred on or after October 1, 2025.
50 For purposes of calculating the amount of a premium which is due pursuant to
51 the terms of a policy of industrial insurance, existing law provides that the
52 maximum amount paid to any one employee for services performed during the 12-
53 month period during which a policy is effective shall be deemed to be $36,000.
54 (NRS 616B.222) Existing law also deems $36,000 to be the maximum amount paid
55 in a policy year to an officer or manager of a quasi-public or private corporation or
56 limited-liability company who receives pay for services performed as an officer,
57 manager or employee of the corporation or company. (NRS 616B.624) Sections 13
58 and 34 of this bill eliminate the $36,000 maximum amount of pay for employees
59 for purposes of calculating the amount of a premium which is due pursuant to the
60 terms of a policy of industrial insurance.
61 Existing law requires an insurer to maintain a list of physicians and chiropractic
62 physicians, selected from a panel established and maintained by the Administrator,
63 from which an injured employee may choose to receive treatment. (NRS 616C.087,
64 616C.090) Sections 14 and 15 of this bill revise: (1) the number of physicians or
65 chiropractic physicians for certain specified disciplines and specializations which
66 an insurer is required to include in its list; (2) provisions governing changes to the
67 panel maintained by the Administrator and a list maintained by an insurer; and (3)
-
*AB469*

– 3 –
68 requirements governing the choice of a physician or chiropractic physician by an
69 injured employee.
70 Existing law: (1) authorizes an injured employee, subject to various
71 requirements and restrictions, to obtain an independent medical examination
72 concerning an injury that is the subject of a claim filed for compensation under
73 industrial insurance; (2) provides that such an injured employee is entitled to
74 request such an independent medical examination for a permanent partial disability
75 under certain circumstances; (3) requires an insurer to pay the costs of any
76 independent medical examination; and (4) provides that the insurer must receive a
77 copy of any report or other document generated as a result of the examination.
78 (NRS 616C.145) Section 16 of this bill: (1) eliminates the right of an injured
79 employee to request an independent medical examination for a permanent partial
80 disability under certain circumstances; and (2) eliminates the duty of an insurer to
81 pay the costs of an independent medical examination and the provision that the
82 insurer must receive a copy of any report or other document that is generated as a
83 result of an independent medical examination.
84 Existing law provides that if an injured employee is discharged as a result of
85 misconduct, an insurer may deny compensation for temporary total disability only
86 by proving that: (1) the injured employee was discharged solely for misconduct and
87 not for any reason relating to the employee’s claim for compensation; and (2) the
88 sole cause for the injured employee’s inability to return to work with the preinjury
89 employer is the discharge for misconduct and not the injury. Existing law also: (1)
90 provides that an insurer waives its rights to deny compensation pursuant to such
91 provisions if the insurer does not make a determination to deny or suspend
92 compensation within 70 days after the insurer learns of the discharge; and (2)
93 prohibits an insurer from denying compensation pursuant to such provisions except
94 for compensation for temporary total disability. (NRS 616C.232) Section 17 of this
95 bill: (1) authorizes an insurer to deny vocational rehabilitation services as well as
96 compensation for temporary total disability to an injured employee who is
97 discharged for misconduct; (2) eliminates provisions requiring a waiver of the
98 rights to deny compensation if the insurer does not make a determination to deny or
99 suspend compensation within 70 days after learning of the discharge; (3) authorizes
100 an insurer to deny compensation for temporary total disability and vocational
101 rehabilitation services to an injured employee who voluntarily resigns from
102 employment with the preinjury employer for any reason unrelated to his or her
103 claim for compensation; and (4) provides that if an injured employee is certified as
104 temporarily totally disabled, the employee’s voluntary resignation or discharge for
105 misconduct does not limit the injured employee’s entitlement to receive benefits for
106 temporary total disability. Section 17 also provides a definition of the term
107 “misconduct” for the purposes of these provisions.
108 Existing law authorizes an insurer or employer who pays an annual increase in
109 compensation for a permanent total disability or certain death benefits to obtain
110 reimbursement from the Administrator and sets forth procedures for obtaining such
111 reimbursement. (NRS 616C.266, 616C.268) Sections 18 and 19 of this bill revise
112 the procedures to require: (1) the Administrator to authorize the State Treasurer to
113 reimburse the insurer and provide the insurer with proof of the authorization; and
114 (2) the State Treasurer to process and issue the payment for reimbursement not later
115 than 10 days after receiving an authorization from the Administrator.
116 Section 20 of this bill revises provisions governing a stay of a decision of an
117 appeals officer.
118 Section 21 of this bill revises provisions governing the duration of payments
119 for a temporary total disability and an employer’s offer of temporary, light-duty
120 employment to an injured employee.
121 Existing law provides that when a claimant elects to receive and accepts
122 payment for a permanent partial disability in a lump sum, the claimant’s benefits
-
*AB469*

– 4 –
123 terminate and the claimant waives certain rights regarding his or her claim, except
124 the right to: (1) reopen his or her claim; (2) have the claim considered by his or her
125 insurer; (3) certain counseling, training and rehabilitative services; (4) receive a
126 benefit penalty; and (5) conclude or resolve any contested matter, with certain
127 exceptions, which is pending at the time of the election of payment for a permanent
128 partial disability in a lump sum. (NRS 616C.495) Section 23 of this bill eliminates
129 the right of a claimant who elects to receive and accepts payment for a permanent
130 partial disability in a lump sum to conclude or resolve any contested matter which
131 is pending at the time of the election of payment in a lump sum.
132 Existing law requires, in the event of a dispute over an award of compensation
133 for permanent partial disability, an insurer to commence making installment
134 payments to the injured employee for the portion of the award that is not in dispute
135 without requiring the injured employee to make an election whether to receive his
136 or her compensation in installment payments or in a lump sum. (NRS 616C.490)
137 Section 22 of this bill requires a claimant, upon the conclusion of such a dispute, to
138 make an election whether to receive his or her award of compensation in
139 installment payments or in a lump sum.
140 Section 24 of this bill revises certain duties of an insurer as they relate to a plan
141 for a program of vocational rehabilitation for an injured employee.
142 (NRS 616C.570)
143 Existing law: (1) authorizes the Administrator to impose upon an insurer,
144 organization for managed care, health care provider, third-party administrator,
145 employer or professional employer organization a benefit penalty for certain
146 violations of law or regulation; and (2) requires proof of the payment of such a
147 benefit penalty to be submitted to the Administrator within 15 days after the date of
148 the Administrator’s determination of the benefit penalty unless an appeal of the
149 benefit penalty is filed and a stay has been granted. (NRS 616D.120, 616D.140)
150 Section 25 of this bill: (1) revises the amounts and schedule of administrative fines
151 which the Administrator may impose as a benefit penalty; and (2) provides that
152 proof of the payment of such a benefit penalty must be submitted to the
153 Administrator within 15 days after the date of the Administrator’s determination of
154 the benefit penalty unless an appeal of the benefit penalty is filed and the appeals
155 process is not yet complete. Section 27 of this bill requires that payment of such a
156 benefit penalty be paid not later than 30 days after an appeals officer or district
157 court renders a decision upholding the imposition of the benefit penalty.
158 Existing law requires each: (1) entertainment industry worker and supervisory
159 employee to obtain a completion card for taking a course in construction industry or
160 general industry safety and health hazard recognition and prevention; and (2)
161 convention services worker and supervisory employee to obtain a completion card
162 for taking such a course. The required courses must be: (1) developed by the
163 Occupational Safety and Health Administration of the United States Department of
164 Labor; and (2) approved by the Division of Industrial Relations of the Department
165 of Business and Industry. Existing law provides that such completion cards expire 5
166 years after their issuance and provide that the completion cards may be renewed by
167 the completion of certain continuing education. (NRS 618.9911, 618.9929) Existing
168 law requires the Division to adopt regulations that set forth guidelines for job-
169 specific training to qualify as continuing education for the purposes of renewing
170 completion cards for the entertainment industry and convention services work.
171 (NRS 618.9909, 618.9927) Sections 28-31 of this bill eliminate provisions: (1)
172 providing for the expiration of completion cards; (2) requiring the completion of
173 continuing education for the renewal of such completion cards; and (3) requiring
174 the Division to adopt regulations setting forth guidelines for job-specific training to
175 qualify as continuing education for the purposes of renewing such completion
176 cards.

34 out of and in the course of his or her employment which entitles the
35 employee to compensation for disability that is substantially greater
36 by reason of the combined effects of the preexisting impairment and
37 the subsequent injury than that which would have resulted from the
38 subsequent injury alone, the compensation due must be charged to
39 the Subsequent Injury Account for Self-Insured Employers in
40 accordance with regulations adopted by the Board.
41 2. If the subsequent injury of such an employee incurred on or

-
*AB469*

– 8 –
1 must be charged to the Subsequent Injury Account for Self-Insured
2 Employers in accordance with regulations adopted by the Board.
3 3. As used in this section, “permanent physical impairment”
4 means any permanent condition, whether congenital or caused by
5 injury or disease, of such seriousness as to constitute a hindrance or
6 obstacle to obtaining employment or to obtaining reemployment if
7 the employee is unemployed. For the purposes of this section, a
8 condition is not a “permanent physical impairment” unless it would
9 support a rating of permanent impairment of 6 percent or more of
10 the whole person if evaluated according to the American Medical
11 Association’s Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment as
12 adopted and supplemented by the Division pursuant to
13 NRS 616C.110.
14 4. To qualify under this section for reimbursement from the
15 Subsequent Injury Account for Self-Insured Employers, the self-
16 insured employer must establish by written records that the self-
17 insured employer had knowledge of the “permanent physical
18 impairment” at the time the employee was hired or that the
19 employee was retained in employment after the self-insured
20 employer acquired such knowledge.
21 5. A self-insured employer must submit to the Board a claim
22 for reimbursement from the Subsequent Injury Account for Self-
23 Insured Employers.
24 6. The Board shall adopt regulations establishing procedures
25 for submitting claims against the Subsequent Injury Account for
26 Self-Insured Employers. The Board shall notify the self-insured
27 employer of its decision on such a claim within 120 days after the
28 claim is received.
29 7. An appeal of any decision made concerning a claim against
30 the Subsequent Injury Account for Self-Insured Employers must be
31 submitted directly to the district court.
32 Sec. 6. NRS 616B.560 is hereby amended to read as follows:
33 616B.560 1. A self-insured employer who pays
34 compensation due to an employee who has a permanent physical
35 impairment from any cause or origin and incurs , on or before
36 September 30, 2025, a subsequent disability by injury arising out of
37 and in the course of his or her employment which entitles the
38 employee to compensation for disability that is substantially greater
39 by reason of the combined effects of the preexisting impairment and
40 the subsequent injury than that which would have resulted from the
41 subsequent injury alone is entitled to be reimbursed from the
42 Subsequent Injury Account for Self-Insured Employers if:
43 (a) The employee knowingly made a false representation as to
44 his or her physical condition at the time the employee was hired by
45 the self-insured employer;
-
*AB469*

– 9 –
1 (b) The self-insured employer relied upon the false
2 representation and this reliance formed a substantial basis of the
3 employment; and
4 (c) A causal connection existed between the false representation
5 and the subsequent disability.
6  If the subsequent injury of the employee incurred on or before
7 September 30, 2025, results in his or her death and it is determined
8 that the death would not have occurred except for the preexisting
9 permanent physical impairment, any compensation paid is entitled
10 to be reimbursed from the Subsequent Injury Account for Self-
11 Insured Employers.
12 2. A self-insured employer shall notify the Board of any
13 possible claim against the Subsequent Injury Account for Self-
14 Insured Employers pursuant to this section no later than 60 days
15 after the date of the subsequent injury or the date the self-insured
16 employer learns of the employee’s false representation, whichever is
17 later.
18 Sec. 7. NRS 616B.575 is hereby amended to read as follows:
19 616B.575 1. There is hereby created in the Fund for
20 Workers’ Compensation and Safety in the State Treasury the
21 Subsequent Injury Account for Associations of Self-Insured Public
22 or Private Employers, which may be used only to make payments in
23 accordance with the provisions of NRS 616B.578 and 616B.581.
24 The Board shall administer the Account based upon
25 recommendations made by the Administrator pursuant to
26 subsection [8.] 7.
27 2. All [assessments,] penalties, bonds, securities and all other
28 properties received, collected or acquired by the Board for the
29 Subsequent Injury Account for Associations of Self-Insured Public
30 or Private Employers must be delivered to the custody of the State
31 Treasurer.
32 3. All money and securities in the Account must be held by the

35 Insured Public or Private Employers.

37 only upon written order of the Board.
38 5. The State Treasurer shall invest money of the Account in the
39 same manner and in the same securities in which the State Treasurer
40 is authorized to invest State General Funds which are in the custody
41 of the State Treasurer. Income realized from the investment of the
42 assets of the Account must be credited to the Account.
43 6. The Board shall adopt regulations for the establishment and
44 administration of [assessment rates,] payments and penalties.
45 [Assessment rates must result in an equitable distribution of costs
-

1 among the associations of self-insured public or private employers
2 and must be based upon expected annual expenditures for claims for
3 payments from the Subsequent Injury Account for Associations of
4 Self-Insured Public or Private Employers.]
5 7. [The Commissioner shall assign an actuary to review the
6 establishment of assessment rates. The rates must be filed with the
7 Commissioner 30 days before their effective date. Any association
8 of self-insured public or private employers that wishes to appeal the
9 rate so filed must do so pursuant to NRS 679B.310.
10 8.] The Administrator shall:

2 the contract and the insurer determines that it is impractical for the
3 injured employee to continue treatment with the physician or
4 chiropractic physician, the injured employee must choose a treating
5 physician or chiropractic physician who has agreed to the terms of

1 7. A certification of disability issued by a physician or
2 chiropractic physician must:
3 (a) Include the period of disability and a description of any
4 physical limitations or restrictions imposed upon [the work of] the
5 employee;
6 (b) Specify whether the limitations or restrictions are permanent
7 or temporary; and
8 (c) Be signed by the treating physician or chiropractic physician
9 authorized pursuant to NRS 616B.527 or appropriately chosen
10 pursuant to subsection 3, 4 or 5 of NRS 616C.090.

12 limitations or restrictions are temporary, the employer of the
13 employee at the time of the employee’s accident may offer
14 temporary, light-duty employment to the employee [.] to commence
15 on a date selected by the employer, which may be as soon as
16 practicable after the offer is made. If the employer makes such an
17 offer, the employer shall confirm the offer in writing within 10 days
18 after making the offer. The making, acceptance or rejection of an
19 offer of temporary, light-duty employment pursuant to this
20 subsection does not affect the eligibility of the employee to receive
21 vocational rehabilitation services, including compensation, and does
22 not exempt the employer from complying with NRS 616C.545 to
23 616C.575, inclusive, and 616C.590 or the regulations adopted by
24 the Division governing vocational rehabilitation services. Any offer

30 (b) Provides a gross wage that is:
31 (1) If the position is in the same classification of employment
32 [,] and the physical limitations or restrictions specified satisfy the
33 physical requirements of the position, equal to the gross wage the
34 employee was earning at the time of his or her injury; or
35 (2) If the position is not in the same classification of
36 employment, substantially similar to the gross wage [the] payable to
37 an employee [was earning at the time of his or her injury; and] that
38 works in a position in the same classification of employment; and
39 (c) Has the same employment benefits as the position of the
40 employee at the time of his or her injury [.] , subject to any
41 minimum requirements established by the provider of those
42 employment benefits.
43 9. If an injured employee accepts an offer of temporary, light-
44 duty employment made pursuant to subsection 8 for a position that
45 is not in the same classification of employment and the gross
-
*AB469*

– 33 –
1 wage, for the position specified in subparagraph (2) of paragraph
2 (b) of subsection 8, is less than the amount that the injured
3 employee is entitled to receive as benefits for a temporary total
4 disability, the injured employee is entitled to receive benefits for a
5 temporary partial disability pursuant to NRS 616C.500.

19 insurer shall schedule an appointment with the rating physician or
20 chiropractic physician selected pursuant to this subsection to

22 (b) Unless the insurer and the injured employee otherwise agree
23 to a rating physician or chiropractic physician:
24 (1) The insurer shall select the rating physician or
25 chiropractic physician from the list of qualified rating physicians
26 and chiropractic physicians designated by the Administrator, to
27 determine the percentage of disability in accordance with the

12 pursuant to NRS 616C.110 that is relevant to the type of injury
13 incurred by the employee.
14 5. At the request of the insurer, the injured employee shall,

30 other than the degree of physical impairment of the whole person
31 may be considered in calculating the entitlement to compensation
32 for a permanent partial disability.

34 the insurer with his or her evaluation of the injured employee. After

44 injuries sustained before July 1, 1981;

12 an award for a permanent partial disability may be paid in a lump
13 sum under the following conditions:
14 (a) A claimant injured on or after July 1, 1973, and before

17 claimant injured on or after July 1, 1981, and before July 1, 1995,

23 entitled to a lump sum equal to the present value of the deceased
24 claimant’s undisbursed award for a permanent partial disability.
25 (c) Any claimant injured on or after July 1, 1981, and before
26 July 1, 1995, who incurs a disability that exceeds 30 percent may
27 elect to receive his or her compensation in a lump sum equal to the
28 present value of an award for a disability of 30 percent. If the
29 claimant elects to receive compensation pursuant to this paragraph,
30 the insurer shall pay in installments to the claimant that portion of
31 the claimant’s disability in excess of 30 percent.
32 (d) Any claimant injured on or after July 1, 1995, and before

41 that portion of the claimant’s disability in excess of 25 percent.
42 (II) To the extent that the insurer has offered to provide

24 in excess of 30 percent.
25 (g) If the permanent partial disability rating of a claimant
26 seeking compensation pursuant to this section would, when
27 combined with any previous permanent partial disability rating of
28 the claimant that resulted in an award of benefits to the claimant,
29 result in the claimant having a total permanent partial disability
30 rating in excess of 100 percent, the claimant’s disability rating upon
31 which compensation is calculated must be reduced by such
32 percentage as required to limit the total permanent partial disability
33 rating of the claimant for all injuries to not more than 100 percent.
34 2. If the claimant elects to receive his or her payment for a
35 permanent partial disability in a lump sum pursuant to subsection 1,
36 all of the claimant’s benefits for compensation terminate. [Except as
37 otherwise provided in paragraph (d), the] The claimant’s acceptance
38 of that payment constitutes a final settlement of all factual and legal
39 issues in the case. By [so] accepting payment for a permanent
40 partial disability in a lump sum pursuant to subsection 1, the
41 claimant waives all of his or her rights regarding the claim,
42 including the right to appeal from the closure of the case or the
43 percentage of his or her disability, except:
44 (a) The right of the claimant to:
-
*AB469*

13 paragraph do not apply to:
14 (1) The scope of the claim;
15 (2) The claimant’s stable and ratable status; and
16 (3) The claimant’s average monthly wage.]
17 3. The claimant, when he or she demands payment in a lump
18 sum pursuant to subsection 2, must be provided with a written
19 notice which prominently displays a statement describing the effects
20 of accepting payment in a lump sum of an entire permanent partial
21 disability award, any portion of such an award or any uncontested
22 portion of such an award, and that the claimant has 20 days after the
23 mailing or personal delivery of the notice within which to retract or
24 reaffirm the demand, before payment may be made and the
25 claimant’s election becomes final.

27 incurred on or after July 1, 1973, must be supplemented if necessary
28 to conform to the provisions of this section.
29 5. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the total
30 lump-sum payment for disablement must not be less than one-half
31 the product of the average monthly wage multiplied by the
32 percentage of disability. If the claimant received compensation in
33 installment payments for his or her permanent partial disability
34 before electing to receive payment for that disability in a lump sum,
35 the lump-sum payment must be calculated for the remaining
36 payment of compensation.
37 6. The lump sum payable must be equal to the present value of
38 the compensation awarded, less any advance payment or lump sum
39 previously paid. The present value must be calculated using monthly
40 payments in the amounts prescribed in subsection 8 of NRS
41 616C.490 and actuarial annuity tables adopted by the Division. The
42 tables must be reviewed annually by a consulting actuary and must
43 be adjusted accordingly on July 1 of each year by the Division
44 using:
-

1 (a) The most recent unisex “Static Mortality Tables for Defined
2 Benefit Pension Plans” published by the Internal Revenue Service;
3 and
4 (b) The average 30-Year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate for
5 March of the current year as reported by the Board of Governors of
6 the Federal Reserve System.
7 7. To calculate the present value of a lump sum payable to a
8 claimant, the insurer shall use the actuarial annuity tables adopted
9 by the Division that are in effect on the date on which the claimant
10 elects payment in a lump sum.
11 8. If a claimant would receive more money by electing to
12 receive compensation in a lump sum than the claimant would if he
13 or she receives installment payments, the claimant may elect to
14 receive the lump-sum payment.
15 Sec. 24. NRS 616C.570 is hereby amended to read as follows:

18 for managed care, health care provider, third-party administrator,
19 employer or professional employer organization has, for a period
20 of 2 years, complied with its plan of corrective action submitted to
21 the Administrator pursuant to paragraph (c) of subsection 2 and
22 committed no additional violations as set forth in that plan, the
23 Administrator shall set the amount of the next administrative fine,
24 if any, imposed against the insurer, organization for managed
25 care, health care provider, third-party administrator, employer or
26 professional employer organization, as applicable, as if that
27 insurer, organization for managed care, health care provider,
28 third-party administrator, employer or professional employer
29 organization, as applicable, had previously committed no
30 violations of any type.
31 4. If the Administrator determines that a violation of any of the
32 provisions of paragraphs (a) to (e), inclusive, (h) or (i) of subsection
33 1 has occurred, the Administrator shall order the insurer,
34 organization for managed care, health care provider, third-party

40 compensation or other relief to a claimant in an amount which is

5 care, health care provider, third-party administrator, employer or
6 professional employer organization pursuant to this section. The

11 section, the benefit penalty is for the benefit of the claimant and
12 must be paid directly to the claimant within 15 days after the date of
13 the Administrator’s determination. If the claimant is the injured
14 employee and the claimant dies before the benefit penalty is paid to
15 him or her, the benefit penalty must be paid to the estate of the
16 claimant. Proof of the payment of the benefit penalty must be
17 submitted to the Administrator within 15 days after the date of the
18 Administrator’s determination unless an appeal is filed pursuant to
19 NRS 616D.140 and [a stay has been granted.] the appeals process is
20 not yet complete. Any compensation to which the claimant may
21 otherwise be entitled pursuant to chapters 616A to 616D, inclusive,
22 or chapter 617 of NRS must not be reduced by the amount of any
23 benefit penalty received pursuant to this subsection. To determine
24 the amount of the benefit penalty in cases of multiple violations
25 occurring within a certain period of time, the Administrator shall
26 adopt regulations which take into consideration:
27 (a) The number of violations within a certain number of years
28 for which a benefit penalty was imposed; and
29 (b) The number of claims handled by the insurer, organization
30 for managed care, health care provider, third-party administrator,
31 employer or professional employer organization in relation to the
32 number of benefit penalties previously imposed within the period of
33 time prescribed pursuant to paragraph (a).
34 [5.] 6. In addition to any fine or benefit penalty imposed
35 pursuant to this section, the Administrator may assess against an
36 insurer who violates any regulation concerning the reporting of
37 claims expenditures or premiums received that are used to calculate
38 an assessment an administrative penalty of up to twice the amount
39 of any underpaid assessment.

42 of the provisions of NRS 616D.200, 616D.220, 616D.240,
43 616D.300, 616D.310 or 616D.350 to 616D.440, inclusive; and
44 (b) The Fraud Control Unit for Industrial Insurance of the Office
45 of the Attorney General established pursuant to NRS 228.420
-
*AB469*

1 notifies the Administrator that the Unit will not prosecute the person
2 for that violation,
3  the Administrator shall impose an administrative fine of not more

15 public or private employers or third-party administrator if, after a
16 hearing, it is shown that the self-insured employer, association of
17 self-insured public or private employers or third-party administrator
18 violated any provision of subsection 1.
19 [9.] 10. If the Administrator determines that a vocational
20 rehabilitation counselor has violated the provisions of NRS
21 616C.543, the Administrator may impose an administrative fine on
22 the vocational rehabilitation counselor of not more than $250 for a
23 first violation, $500 for a second violation and $1,000 for a third or
24 subsequent violation.
25 [10.] 11. The Administrator may make a claim against the

27 administrative fine or benefit penalty imposed for a violation of the
28 provisions of this section.
29 Sec. 26. NRS 616D.130 is hereby amended to read as follows:

– 45 –
1 (b) Within 60 days after the date on which the investigation is

22 appropriate agency that regulates the activities of the violator.
23 4. If, based upon the Administrator’s findings of fact, the

25 Administrator shall issue a determination to that effect.
26 Sec. 27. NRS 616D.140 is hereby amended to read as follows:
27 616D.140 1. If a person wishes to contest a decision of the
28 Administrator to impose or refuse to impose a benefit penalty
29 pursuant to NRS 616D.120, the person must file a notice of appeal
30 with an appeals officer in accordance with this section. The notice
31 of appeal must set forth the reasons the proposed benefit penalty
32 should or should not be imposed.
33 2. A person who is aggrieved by:
34 (a) A written determination of the Administrator; or
35 (b) The failure of the Administrator to respond within 120 days
36 to a complaint filed pursuant to NRS 616D.130 and received by the
37 Administrator from the person who is aggrieved,
38  may appeal from the determination or failure to respond by filing

40 be filed within 30 days after the date on which the notice of the
41 Administrator’s determination was mailed by the Administrator or
42 within 150 days after the date on which the unanswered complaint
43 was received by the Administrator, as applicable. The failure of the
44 Administrator to respond within 120 days after receipt of the

-
*AB469*

– 46 –
1 any allegation of a violation of subsection 1, 2 or [3] 4 of NRS

12 the appeals officer as a hearing de novo. The appeals officer shall
13 render a written decision on the appeal. Except as otherwise
14 provided in this section, the provisions of NRS 616C.345 to
15 616C.385, inclusive, apply to an appeal filed pursuant to this
16 section.
17 5. A benefit penalty imposed pursuant to NRS 616D.120 must
18 be paid to the claimant on whose behalf it is imposed. If such a
19 payment is not made within the period required by NRS 616D.120,
20 the benefit penalty may be recovered in a civil action brought by the
21 Administrator on behalf of the claimant in a court of competent
22 jurisdiction in the county in which the claimant resides, in which the
23 violation occurred or in which the person who is required to pay the
24 benefit penalty has his or her principal place of business.
25 6. Any party aggrieved by a decision issued pursuant to this
26 section by an appeals officer may appeal the decision directly to the
27 district court.
28 7. If an appeals officer or district court renders a decision
29 upholding the imposition of a benefit penalty, the insurer,
30 organization for managed care, health care provider, third-party
31 administrator, employer or professional employer organization upon
32 which the benefit penalty is imposed shall, not later than 30 days
33 after the date on which the decision is rendered [, unless an appeal is
34 filed and a stay has been granted,] and the appeals process is
35 complete, pay to the claimant the benefit penalty in an amount equal
36 to twice the amount of the benefit penalty initially imposed.
37 8. If a claimant enters into a settlement agreement with an
38 insurer, organization for managed care, health care provider, third-
39 party administrator, employer or professional employer organization
40 concerning the amount of a benefit penalty owed to the claimant, the
41 insurer, organization for managed care, health care provider, third-

2 provider, third-party administrator, employer or professional
3 employer organization fails to pay a benefit penalty to a claimant
4 within the time limits imposed by this section or subsection [4] 5 of
5 NRS 616D.120, the Commissioner may suspend, pending an
6 investigation or any other disciplinary action, any certificate issued
7 by the Commissioner to the insurer, organization for managed care,
8 health care provider, third-party administrator, employer or
9 professional employer organization, as applicable.
