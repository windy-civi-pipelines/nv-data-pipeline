EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public safety; creating a pilot program authorizing the
Department of Transportation, a local authority and a regional
transportation commission to allow the installation and use of an
automated traffic enforcement system to enforce certain provisions of
law; requiring a peace officer of a traffic enforcement agency having
jurisdiction over the location of an automated traffic enforcement
system to review certain evidence detected by the automated traffic
enforcement system before a citation is issued; establishing
requirements relating to the issuance of a civil infraction citation based
on evidence detected by an automated traffic enforcement system;
creating a rebuttable presumption that the registered owner of a vehicle
is the driver of the vehicle at the time of a violation detected by an
automated traffic enforcement system; requiring the Department to
annually compile and submit certain information to the Director of the
Legislative Counsel Bureau; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits a governmental entity or any agent thereof from using
2 photographic, video or digital equipment to gather evidence in order to issue a traffic citation
3 or civil infraction citation, unless the equipment is: (1) a portable camera or event recording
4 device worn or held by a peace officer; (2) installed within a vehicle or facility of a law
5 enforcement agency; or (3) privately owned by a nongovernmental entity. (NRS 484A.600)
6 Sections 2.1-2.7 of this bill provide an exception to this prohibition and create a pilot program
7 authorizing the Department of Transportation, a local authority and a regional transportation
8 commission to allow for the installation and use of an automated traffic enforcement system to
9 enforce certain speed limits in temporary traffic control zones under certain circumstances.
10 Section 2.2 sets forth the conditions for the installation and use of an automated traffic
11 enforcement system and for contracting for such installation and use and requires an entity
12 which installs such a system to, among other things, carry out a public information campaign
13 before commencing any enforcement.

Assembly Amendment No. 858 to Assembly Bill No. 402 First Reprint Page 4
14 Section 2.3 requires a peace officer of a traffic enforcement agency with jurisdiction over
15 the location of the automated traffic enforcement system to review the evidence of a violation
16 detected by an automated traffic enforcement system before a civil infraction citation is
17 issued. Section 2.3 also establishes requirements for the contents and delivery of a civil
18 infraction citation issued based upon evidence collected by an automated traffic enforcement
19 system. Finally, section 2.3 creates a rebuttable presumption that the registered owner of a
20 vehicle is the driver of the vehicle at the time of a violation detected by an automated traffic
21 enforcement system and provides a method for rebutting this presumption.
22 Section 2.4 establishes requirements for the storage and transmission of any photograph,
23 recorded image or data created by an automated traffic enforcement system. Section 2.4 also
24 prohibits any entity that manufactures, maintains, produces or provides an automated traffic
25 enforcement system or related services for sale or lease to this State or any political
26 subdivision of this State from contracting to receive payment on the basis of the number of
27 citations issued.
28 Section 2.6 provides that a violation detected by an automated traffic enforcement system
29 is not a moving traffic violation but is punishable by a civil penalty not to exceed $200.
30 Section 2.6 also requires that any funds collected from such civil infractions in excess of the
31 cost and maintenance of the automated traffic enforcement systems be apportioned by the
32 board of county highway commissioners for certain expenses.
33 Section 2.7 requires the Department, a local authority and a regional transportation
34 commission who authorize the installation and use of an automated traffic enforcement system
35 to annually compile certain information and report it to the Director of the Legislative Counsel
36 Bureau for transmittal to the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Growth and Infrastructure.
37 Section 2.8 of this bill prohibits an employer from considering a civil infraction
38 citation issued to an employee pursuant to section 2.3 for the purpose of progressive
39 discipline against such an employee.
40 Sections 1, 4 and 5 of this bill make conforming changes to: (1) exclude traffic violations
41 detected by an automated traffic enforcement system from the assessment of demerit points;
42 and (2) provide for the issuance of civil infraction citations for violations detected by an
43 automated traffic enforcement system. Section 5 of this bill also extends the time to respond
44 to such a citation to 120 days.
45 Existing law provides that before a hearing to contest the determination that a person has
46 committed a civil infraction, the person is required to post a bond equal to the amount of the
47 full payment of the monetary penalty, the administrative assessment and any fees specified in
48 the civil infraction citation. (NRS 484A.7041) Section 6 of this bill limits the amount of a
49 bond for a civil infraction citation issued for a violation described in section 2.2 to an amount
50 not to exceed $100. Section 8 of this bill provides that the pilot program expires by limitation
51 on June 30, 2029.

1 2. The Department shall establish a uniform system of demerit points for
2 various traffic violations occurring within this State affecting the driving privilege
3 of any person who holds a driver’s license issued by the Department and persons

10 traffic violations. If a conviction of two or more traffic violations committed on a
11 single occasion is obtained, points must be assessed for one offense or civil
12 infraction, and if the point values differ, points must be assessed for the offense or
13 civil infraction having the greater point value. Details of the violation must be

35 maintenance or repair of the highway are present.
36 2. An automated traffic enforcement system must be accompanied by
37 warning signs installed at the entry point of the temporary traffic control zone.

47 of citations issued during the use of the automated traffic enforcement system in
48 a temporary traffic control zone to be tracked and reported to the Department,
49 local authority or regional transportation commission, as applicable.
50 4. Before commencing any enforcement, including the issuance of a civil
51 infraction citation pursuant to NRS 484A.7035 for a violation described in this
52 section, the Department, a local authority or a regional transportation
53 commission as defined in NRS 482.1825 that installs an automated traffic

Assembly Amendment No. 858 to Assembly Bill No. 402 First Reprint Page 6
1 enforcement system shall establish and carry out a public information campaign
2 to:
3 (a) Raise public awareness of the proposed use of an automated traffic
4 enforcement system not less than 30 days before commencing any enforcement;
