AN ACT relating to public safety; creating a pilot program
authorizing the Department of Transportation, a local
authority and a regional transportation commission to
allow the installation and use of an automated traffic
enforcement system to enforce certain provisions of law;
requiring a peace officer of a traffic enforcement agency
having jurisdiction over the location of an automated
traffic enforcement system to review certain evidence
detected by the automated traffic enforcement system
before a citation is issued; establishing requirements
relating to the issuance of a civil infraction citation based
on evidence detected by an automated traffic enforcement

4 camera or event recording device worn or held by a peace officer; (2) installed
5 within a vehicle or facility of a law enforcement agency; or (3) privately owned by
6 a nongovernmental entity. (NRS 484A.600) Sections 2.1-2.7 of this bill provide an

7 exception to this prohibition and create a pilot program authorizing the Department
8 of Transportation, a local authority and a regional transportation commission to
9 allow for the installation and use of an automated traffic enforcement system to
10 enforce certain speed limits in temporary traffic control zones under certain
11 circumstances. Section 2.2 sets forth the conditions for the installation and use of
12 an automated traffic enforcement system and requires an entity which installs such
13 a system to, among other things, carry out a public information campaign before
14 commencing any enforcement.
15 Section 2.3 requires a peace officer of a traffic enforcement agency with
16 jurisdiction over the location of the automated traffic enforcement system to review
17 the evidence of a violation detected by an automated traffic enforcement system
18 before a civil infraction citation is issued. Section 2.3 also establishes requirements
19 for the contents and delivery of a civil infraction citation issued based upon
20 evidence collected by an automated traffic enforcement system. Finally, section 2.3
21 creates a rebuttable presumption that the registered owner of a vehicle is the driver
22 of the vehicle at the time of a violation detected by an automated traffic
23 enforcement system and provides a method for rebutting this presumption.
24 Section 2.4 establishes requirements for the storage and transmission of any
25 photograph, recorded image or data created by an automated traffic enforcement
26 system. Section 2.4 also prohibits any entity who manufactures, maintains,
27 produces or provides an automated traffic enforcement system or related services
28 for sale or lease to this State or any political subdivision of this State from
29 contracting to receive payment on the basis of the number of citations issued.
30 Section 2.6 provides that a violation detected by an automated traffic
31 enforcement system is not a moving traffic violation but is punishable by a civil
32 penalty not to exceed $200. Section 2.6 also requires that any funds collected from
33 such civil infractions in excess of the cost and maintenance of the automated traffic
34 enforcement systems be apportioned by the board of county highway
35 commissioners for certain expenses.
36 Section 2.7 requires the Department, a local authority and a regional
37 transportation commission who authorize the installation and use of an automated
38 traffic enforcement system to annually compile certain information and report it to
39 the Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau for transmittal to the Joint Interim
40 Standing Committee on Growth and Infrastructure.
41 Sections 1, 4 and 5 of this bill make conforming changes to: (1) exclude traffic
42 violations detected by an automated traffic enforcement system from the
43 assessment of demerit points; and (2) provide for the issuance of civil infraction
44 citations for violations detected by an automated traffic enforcement system.
45 Section 5 of this bill also extends the time to respond to such a citation to 120 days.
46 Existing law provides that before a hearing to contest the determination that a
47 person has committed a civil infraction, the person is required to post a bond equal
48 to the amount of the full payment of the monetary penalty, the administrative
49 assessment and any fees specified in the civil infraction citation. (NRS 484A.7041)
50 Section 6 of this bill limits the amount of a bond for a civil infraction citation
51 issued for a violation described in section 2.2 to an amount not to exceed $100.
52 Section 8 of this bill provides that the pilot program expires by limitation on
53 June 30, 2029.

5 municipal court or justice court in this State that a person has
6 committed a civil infraction pursuant to NRS 484A.703 to
7 484A.705, inclusive. The term includes a finding by a juvenile court
8 that a child has violated a traffic law or ordinance other than one
9 governing standing or parking. The term does not include [a] :
10 (a) A conviction or a finding by a juvenile court of a violation of
11 the speed limit posted by a public authority under the circumstances
12 described in subsection 1 of NRS 484B.617 [.] ; or
13 (b) A civil infraction citation issued pursuant to NRS
14 484A.7035 for a violation described in section 2.2 of this act.
15 2. The Department shall establish a uniform system of demerit
16 points for various traffic violations occurring within this State
17 affecting the driving privilege of any person who holds a driver’s
18 license issued by the Department and persons deemed to have future
19 driving privileges pursuant to NRS 483.447. The system must be
20 based on the accumulation of demerits during a period of 12
21 months.
22 3. The system must be uniform in its operation, and the
23 Department shall set up a schedule of demerits for each traffic
24 violation, depending upon the gravity of the violation, on a scale of
25 one demerit point for a minor violation of any traffic law to eight
26 demerit points for an extremely serious violation of the law
27 governing traffic violations. If a conviction of two or more traffic
28 violations committed on a single occasion is obtained, points must
29 be assessed for one offense or civil infraction, and if the point values
30 differ, points must be assessed for the offense or civil infraction
31 having the greater point value. Details of the violation must be
32 submitted to the Department by the court where the conviction or
33 finding is obtained. The Department may provide for a graduated
34 system of demerits within each category of violations according to
35 the extent to which the traffic law was violated.
36 Sec. 2. Chapter 484A of NRS is hereby amended by adding
37 thereto the provisions set forth as sections 2.1 to 2.7, inclusive, of
38 this act.
39 Sec. 2.1. As used in sections 2.1 to 2.7, inclusive, of this act,

2 as evidence of a violation of a traffic law by the driver of the
3 vehicle. Such a photograph or other recorded image must not
4 reveal the face of the driver or any other passenger in the vehicle.
5 Sec. 2.2. 1. The Department of Transportation, a local
6 authority and a regional transportation commission as defined in
7 NRS 482.1825 may, except as otherwise provided in subsection 3,
8 authorize the installation and use of an automated traffic
9 enforcement system to enforce any rate of speed which is 10 miles
10 per hour or more over the posted speed limit:
11 (a) In an area designated as a temporary traffic control zone
12 in which construction, maintenance or repair of a highway is
13 conducted; and
14 (b) At a time when the workers who are performing the
15 construction, maintenance or repair of the highway are present.
16 2. An automated traffic enforcement system must be
17 accompanied by warning signs installed at the entry point of the
18 temporary traffic control zone. The Department shall adopt
19 regulations setting forth standards for such warning signs,
20 including, without limitation:
21 (a) A statement that an automated traffic enforcement system
22 is in use;
23 (b) A statement of the speed limit; and

27 for a violation described in this section, the Department, a local
28 authority or a regional transportation commission as defined in
29 NRS 482.1825 that installs an automated traffic enforcement
30 system shall establish and carry out a public information
31 campaign to:
32 (a) Raise public awareness of the proposed use of an
33 automated traffic enforcement system not less than 30 days before
34 commencing any enforcement; and
35 (b) Inform the public of the date upon which enforcement will
36 begin.
37 Sec. 2.3. 1. Before a civil infraction citation is issued
38 pursuant to NRS 484A.7035 for a violation described in section
39 2.2 of this act, the evidence of the violation from the automated
40 traffic enforcement system must be reviewed for accuracy by a
41 peace officer of a traffic enforcement agency with jurisdiction over
42 the location of the automated traffic enforcement system.
43 2. If after reviewing the evidence described in subsection 1,
44 the peace officer determines that a violation described in section
45 2.2 of this act occurred, the peace officer shall cause a civil
-
*AB402_R1*

1 infraction citation to be issued pursuant to NRS 484A.7035. The
2 citation must be sent by the traffic enforcement agency described
3 in subsection 1 or its designee by first class mail to the address

5 owner of the vehicle identified by the automated traffic
6 enforcement system.
7 3. A manual or automated record prepared by a traffic
8 enforcement agency described in subsection 1 or its designee in
9 the ordinary course of business shall be prima facie evidence of
10 mailing and service, and is admissible in any hearing as to the
11 facts contained in the civil infraction citation.
12 4. In addition to the information required pursuant to
13 subsection 1 of NRS 484A.7035, a civil infraction citation issued
14 pursuant to NRS 484A.7035 for a violation described in section
15 2.2 of this act must include:
16 (a) The date and time of the violation;
17 (b) An image taken by the automated traffic enforcement

22 5. The registered owner of a vehicle is presumed to be the
23 driver of the vehicle at the time of a violation described in section
24 2.2 of this act was detected by an automated traffic enforcement
25 system. Such an inference may be rebutted if the registered owner
26 of the vehicle presents as evidence at a hearing held pursuant to
27 subsection 3 of NRS 484A.704, an affidavit stating:
28 (a) The name and address of the person having care, custody
29 and control of the vehicle at the time of the violation; or
30 (b) That the vehicle was, at the time of the violation, stolen.
31 Such an affidavit must be accompanied by evidence that supports
32 the affidavit, including, without limitation, a police report or an
33 insurance report.
34 Sec. 2.4. 1. Any photograph, recorded image or data
35 created by an automated traffic enforcement system:
36 (a) Must only be stored and disseminated by the traffic
37 enforcement agency that issued the civil infraction citation

4 this act do not prohibit a peace officer from issuing a citation for a
5 violation of any law of this State at the place where an automated

7 officer witnesses a violation. A person who is issued a citation by a
8 peace officer pursuant to this subsection must not be issued a civil
9 infraction citation based on evidence from the automated traffic
10 enforcement system for the same violation for which the peace
11 officer issued the person the citation.

29 Sec. 2.7. 1. Each local authority and regional
30 transportation commission as defined in NRS 482.1825 that

40 compare not only the driver’s name but also the number of his or her
41 driver’s license and physical description with any information
42 obtained from the agency as a result of the request. If the
43 information received from the agency indicates that the driver’s
44 name is on an outstanding warrant for a prior offense, the officer
45 shall not arrest the driver for that prior offense unless the additional

3 4. A hearing conducted pursuant to this section must be
4 conducted by the court without a jury. In lieu of the personal
5 appearance at the hearing by the peace officer who issued the civil
6 infraction citation, the court may consider the information contained
7 in the civil infraction citation and any other written statement
8 submitted under oath by the peace officer. If the court has
9 established a system pursuant to NRS 484A.615, the peace officer
10 may, if authorized by the court, use the system to submit such a
11 statement. The person named in the civil infraction citation may
12 subpoena witnesses, including, without limitation, the peace officer
13 who issued the citation, and has the right to present evidence and
14 examine witnesses present in court.
15 5. After consideration of the evidence and argument, the court
16 shall determine whether a civil infraction was committed by the
17 person named in the civil infraction citation. The court must find by
18 a preponderance of the evidence that the person named in the civil
19 infraction citation committed a civil infraction. If it has not been
20 established by a preponderance of the evidence that the infraction
21 was committed by the person named in the citation, the court must
22 enter an order dismissing the civil infraction citation in the court’s
23 records. If it has been established by a preponderance of the
24 evidence that the infraction was committed, the court must enter in
25 the court’s records an order pursuant to NRS 484A.7043.
26 6. An appeal from the court’s determination or order may be
27 taken in the same manner as any other civil appeal from a municipal
28 court or justice court, as applicable, except that:
29 (a) The notice of appeal must be filed not later than 7 calendar
30 days after the court enters in the court’s records an order pursuant to
31 NRS 484A.7043;
32 (b) If the appellant is the person charged with the civil
33 infraction, any bond required to be given by the appellant in order to
34 secure a stay of execution of the order of the court during the
35 pendency of the appeal must equal the amount of the monetary
36 penalty and administrative assessments which the court has ordered
37 the appellant to pay pursuant to NRS 484A.7043. Any bond must be
38 forfeited if the order of the court is affirmed on appeal; and
39 (c) If a prosecuting attorney does not represent the plaintiff
40 during the proceedings in the justice court or municipal court, the
41 appellate court shall review the record and any arguments presented
42 by the person charged with the civil infraction and render a decision.
43 Sec. 7. The provisions of subsection 1 of NRS 218D.380 do
