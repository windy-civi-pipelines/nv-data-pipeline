7 exception to this prohibition and create a pilot program authorizing the Department
8 of Transportation, a local authority and a regional transportation commission to
9 allow for the installation and use of an automated traffic enforcement system to
10 enforce certain speed limits in temporary traffic control zones under certain
11 circumstances. Section 2.2 sets forth the conditions for the installation and use of
12 an automated traffic enforcement system and for contracting for such installation
13 and use and requires an entity which installs such a system to, among other things,
14 carry out a public information campaign before commencing any enforcement.
15 Section 2.3 requires a peace officer of a traffic enforcement agency with
16 jurisdiction over the location of the automated traffic enforcement system to review
17 the evidence of a violation detected by an automated traffic enforcement system
18 before a civil infraction citation is issued. Section 2.3 also establishes requirements
19 for the contents and delivery of a civil infraction citation issued based upon
20 evidence collected by an automated traffic enforcement system. Finally, section 2.3
21 creates a rebuttable presumption that the registered owner of a vehicle is the driver
22 of the vehicle at the time of a violation detected by an automated traffic
23 enforcement system and provides a method for rebutting this presumption.
24 Section 2.4 establishes requirements for the storage and transmission of any
25 photograph, recorded image or data created by an automated traffic enforcement
26 system. Section 2.4 also prohibits any entity that manufactures, maintains,
27 produces or provides an automated traffic enforcement system or related services
28 for sale or lease to this State or any political subdivision of this State from
29 contracting to receive payment on the basis of the number of citations issued.
30 Section 2.6 provides that a violation detected by an automated traffic
31 enforcement system is not a moving traffic violation but is punishable by a civil
32 penalty not to exceed $200. Section 2.6 also requires that any funds collected from
33 such civil infractions in excess of the cost and maintenance of the automated traffic
34 enforcement systems be apportioned by the board of county highway
35 commissioners for certain expenses.
36 Section 2.7 requires the Department, a local authority and a regional
37 transportation commission who authorize the installation and use of an automated
38 traffic enforcement system to annually compile certain information and report it to
39 the Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau for transmittal to the Joint Interim
40 Standing Committee on Growth and Infrastructure.
41 Section 2.8 of this bill prohibits an employer from considering a civil infraction
42 citation issued to an employee pursuant to section 2.3 for the purpose of
43 progressive discipline against such an employee.
44 Sections 1, 4 and 5 of this bill make conforming changes to: (1) exclude traffic
45 violations detected by an automated traffic enforcement system from the
46 assessment of demerit points; and (2) provide for the issuance of civil infraction
47 citations for violations detected by an automated traffic enforcement system.
48 Section 5 of this bill also extends the time to respond to such a citation to 120 days.
49 Existing law provides that before a hearing to contest the determination that a
50 person has committed a civil infraction, the person is required to post a bond equal
51 to the amount of the full payment of the monetary penalty, the administrative
52 assessment and any fees specified in the civil infraction citation. (NRS 484A.7041)
53 Section 6 of this bill limits the amount of a bond for a civil infraction citation
54 issued for a violation described in section 2.2 to an amount not to exceed $100.
55 Section 8 of this bill provides that the pilot program expires by limitation on
56 June 30, 2029.

7 484A.705, inclusive. The term includes a finding by a juvenile court
8 that a child has violated a traffic law or ordinance other than one

26 demerit points for an extremely serious violation of the law
27 governing traffic violations. If a conviction of two or more traffic
28 violations committed on a single occasion is obtained, points must
29 be assessed for one offense or civil infraction, and if the point values
30 differ, points must be assessed for the offense or civil infraction
31 having the greater point value. Details of the violation must be
32 submitted to the Department by the court where the conviction or
33 finding is obtained. The Department may provide for a graduated
34 system of demerits within each category of violations according to
35 the extent to which the traffic law was violated.
36 Sec. 2. Chapter 484A of NRS is hereby amended by adding
37 thereto the provisions set forth as sections 2.1 to 2.8, inclusive, of

5 Sec. 2.2. 1. The Department of Transportation, a local
6 authority and a regional transportation commission as defined in
7 NRS 482.1825 may, except as otherwise provided in subsection 4,

11 (a) In an area designated as a temporary traffic control zone
12 in which construction, maintenance or repair of a highway is
13 conducted; and
14 (b) At a time when the workers who are performing the
15 construction, maintenance or repair of the highway are present.
16 2. An automated traffic enforcement system must be
17 accompanied by warning signs installed at the entry point of the

35 issuance of a civil infraction citation pursuant to NRS 484A.7035
36 for a violation described in this section, the Department, a local
37 authority or a regional transportation commission as defined in
38 NRS 482.1825 that installs an automated traffic enforcement
39 system shall establish and carry out a public information
40 campaign to:
41 (a) Raise public awareness of the proposed use of an

1 Sec. 2.3. 1. Before a civil infraction citation is issued
2 pursuant to NRS 484A.7035 for a violation described in section
3 2.2 of this act, the evidence of the violation from the automated
4 traffic enforcement system must be reviewed for accuracy by a
5 peace officer of a traffic enforcement agency with jurisdiction over

7 2. If after reviewing the evidence described in subsection 1,
8 the peace officer determines that a violation described in section
9 2.2 of this act occurred, the peace officer shall cause a civil
10 infraction citation to be issued pursuant to NRS 484A.7035. The
11 citation must be sent by the traffic enforcement agency described
12 in subsection 1 or its designee by first class mail to the address
13 listed with the Department of Motor Vehicles for the registered
14 owner of the vehicle identified by the automated traffic
15 enforcement system.
16 3. A manual or automated record prepared by a traffic
17 enforcement agency described in subsection 1 or its designee in
18 the ordinary course of business shall be prima facie evidence of
19 mailing and service, and is admissible in any hearing as to the
20 facts contained in the civil infraction citation.
21 4. In addition to the information required pursuant to
22 subsection 1 of NRS 484A.7035, a civil infraction citation issued

31 5. The registered owner of a vehicle is presumed to be the
32 driver of the vehicle at the time of a violation described in section
33 2.2 of this act was detected by an automated traffic enforcement
34 system. Such an inference may be rebutted if the registered owner
35 of the vehicle presents as evidence at a hearing held pursuant to
36 subsection 3 of NRS 484A.704, an affidavit stating:
37 (a) The name and address of the person having care, custody

16 traffic enforcement system is installed and in use if the peace
17 officer witnesses a violation. A person who is issued a citation by a
18 peace officer pursuant to this section must not be issued a civil
19 infraction citation based on evidence from the automated traffic
20 enforcement system for the same violation for which the peace
21 officer issued the person the citation.

38 to 2.8, inclusive, of this act. Any remaining funds may be
39 apportioned by the board of county highway commissioners to the
40 road funds of the county, as applicable, to be expended as
41 described in NRS 403.470.

1 Sec. 6. NRS 484A.7041 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 484A.7041 1. If, pursuant to subsection 3 of NRS 484A.704,

30 appearance at the hearing by the peace officer who issued the civil
31 infraction citation, the court may consider the information contained
32 in the civil infraction citation and any other written statement
33 submitted under oath by the peace officer. If the court has
34 established a system pursuant to NRS 484A.615, the peace officer
35 may, if authorized by the court, use the system to submit such a
36 statement. The person named in the civil infraction citation may
37 subpoena witnesses, including, without limitation, the peace officer
38 who issued the citation, and has the right to present evidence and
39 examine witnesses present in court.
40 5. After consideration of the evidence and argument, the court
41 shall determine whether a civil infraction was committed by the
42 person named in the civil infraction citation. The court must find by
43 a preponderance of the evidence that the person named in the civil
44 infraction citation committed a civil infraction. If it has not been
45 established by a preponderance of the evidence that the infraction
-
*AB402_R2*

– 11 –
1 was committed by the person named in the citation, the court must
2 enter an order dismissing the civil infraction citation in the court’s
3 records. If it has been established by a preponderance of the
4 evidence that the infraction was committed, the court must enter in
5 the court’s records an order pursuant to NRS 484A.7043.
6 6. An appeal from the court’s determination or order may be
7 taken in the same manner as any other civil appeal from a municipal
8 court or justice court, as applicable, except that:

10 days after the court enters in the court’s records an order pursuant to
11 NRS 484A.7043;
12 (b) If the appellant is the person charged with the civil
13 infraction, any bond required to be given by the appellant in order to
14 secure a stay of execution of the order of the court during the
