AN ACT relating to public safety; authorizing the Department of
Transportation, a local authority and a regional
transportation commission to allow the installation and
use of an automated traffic enforcement system to enforce
certain provisions of law; requiring a peace officer of a
traffic enforcement agency having jurisdiction over the
location of an automated traffic enforcement system to
review certain evidence detected by the automated traffic
enforcement system before a citation is issued;
establishing requirements relating to the issuance of a
civil infraction citation based on evidence detected by an
automated traffic enforcement system; creating a
rebuttable presumption that the registered owner of

thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits a governmental entity or any agent thereof from using
2 photographic, video or digital equipment to gather evidence in order to issue a
3 traffic citation or civil infraction citation, unless the equipment is: (1) a portable
4 camera or event recording device worn or held by a peace officer; (2) installed
5 within a vehicle or facility of a law enforcement agency; or (3) privately owned by
6 a nongovernmental entity. (NRS 484A.600) Sections 2 and 3 of this bill create an
7 exception to this prohibition, authorizing the Department of Transportation, a local
8 authority and a regional transportation commission to allow for the installation and

– 2 –
9 use of an automated traffic enforcement system to enforce provisions of law
10 governing the speed limits in temporary traffic control zones under certain
11 circumstances. Section 2 requires a peace officer of a traffic enforcement agency
12 with jurisdiction over the location of the automated traffic enforcement system to
13 review the evidence of a violation detected by an automated traffic enforcement
14 system before a citation is issued. Section 2 also establishes requirements for the
15 contents and delivery of a civil infraction citation issued based upon evidence
16 collected by an automated traffic enforcement system. Section 2 creates a
17 rebuttable presumption that the registered owner of a vehicle is the driver of the
18 vehicle at the time of a violation detected by an automated traffic enforcement
19 system and provides a method for rebutting this presumption. Finally, section 2
20 provides that a violation detected by an automated traffic enforcement system is not
21 a moving traffic violation but is punishable by a civil penalty.
22 Sections 1, 4 and 5 of this bill make conforming changes to: (1) exclude traffic
23 violations detected by an automated traffic enforcement system from the
24 assessment of demerit points; and (2) provide for the issuance of civil infraction
25 citations for violations detected by an automated traffic enforcement system.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 483.473 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 483.473 1. As used in this section, “traffic violation” means
3 conviction of a moving traffic violation in any municipal court,
4 justice court or district court in this State or a finding by any
5 municipal court or justice court in this State that a person has
6 committed a civil infraction pursuant to NRS 484A.703 to
7 484A.705, inclusive. The term includes a finding by a juvenile court
8 that a child has violated a traffic law or ordinance other than one
9 governing standing or parking. The term does not include [a] :
10 (a) A conviction or a finding by a juvenile court of a violation of
11 the speed limit posted by a public authority under the circumstances
12 described in subsection 1 of NRS 484B.617 [.] ; or
13 (b) A citation issued for a violation detected by an automated
14 traffic enforcement system pursuant to section 2 of this act.
15 2. The Department shall establish a uniform system of demerit
16 points for various traffic violations occurring within this State
17 affecting the driving privilege of any person who holds a driver’s
18 license issued by the Department and persons deemed to have future
19 driving privileges pursuant to NRS 483.447. The system must be
20 based on the accumulation of demerits during a period of 12
21 months.
22 3. The system must be uniform in its operation, and the
23 Department shall set up a schedule of demerits for each traffic
24 violation, depending upon the gravity of the violation, on a scale of
25 one demerit point for a minor violation of any traffic law to eight
26 demerit points for an extremely serious violation of the law
-
*AB402*

– 3 –
1 governing traffic violations. If a conviction of two or more traffic
2 violations committed on a single occasion is obtained, points must
3 be assessed for one offense or civil infraction, and if the point values
4 differ, points must be assessed for the offense or civil infraction
5 having the greater point value. Details of the violation must be
6 submitted to the Department by the court where the conviction or
7 finding is obtained. The Department may provide for a graduated
8 system of demerits within each category of violations according to
9 the extent to which the traffic law was violated.
10 Sec. 2. Chapter 484A of NRS is hereby amended by adding
11 thereto a new section to read as follows:
12 1. The Department of Transportation, a local authority and a
13 regional transportation commission as defined in NRS 482.1825
14 may authorize the installation and use of an automated traffic
15 enforcement system to enforce any speed limit:
16 (a) In an area designated as a temporary traffic control zone
17 in which construction, maintenance or repair of a highway is
18 conducted; and
19 (b) At a time when the workers who are performing the
20 construction, maintenance or repair of the highway are present.
21 2. Before a civil infraction citation is issued pursuant to NRS
22 484A.7035 for a violation described in subsection 1, the evidence
23 of the violation from the automated traffic enforcement system
24 must be reviewed for accuracy by a peace officer of a traffic
25 enforcement agency with jurisdiction over the location of the
26 automated traffic enforcement system.
27 3. A civil infraction citation issued pursuant to NRS
28 484A.7035 for a violation described in subsection 1 must be sent
29 by the traffic enforcement agency described in subsection 1 by first
30 class mail to the address listed with the Department of
31 Transportation for the registered owner of the vehicle identified by
32 the automated traffic enforcement system.
33 4. In addition to the information required pursuant to
34 subsection 1 of NRS 484A.7035, a civil infraction citation issued
35 pursuant to NRS 484A.7035 for a violation described in subsection
36 1 must include:
37 (a) The date and time of the violation;
38 (b) An image taken by the automated traffic enforcement
39 system showing the vehicle and vehicle license plate involved in
40 the violation or the address of the Internet website on which such
41 an image may be viewed; and
42 (c) A statement summarizing the provisions of subsection 5.
43 5. The registered owner of a vehicle is presumed to be the
44 driver of the vehicle at the time of a violation described in
45 subsection 1 was detected by an automated traffic enforcement

1 system. Such an inference may be rebutted if the registered owner
2 of the vehicle presents as evidence at a hearing held pursuant to
3 subsection 3 of NRS 484A.704, an affidavit stating:
4 (a) The name and address of the person having care, custody
5 and control of the vehicle at the time of the violation; or
6 (b) That the vehicle was, at the time of the violation, stolen.
7 Such an affidavit must be accompanied by evidence that supports
8 the affidavit, including, without limitation, a police report or an
9 insurance report.
10 6. The provisions of this section do not prohibit a peace
11 officer from issuing a citation for a violation of any law of this
12 State at the place where an automated traffic enforcement system
13 is installed and in use if the peace officer witnesses a violation. A
14 person who is issued a citation by a peace officer pursuant to this
15 subsection must not be issued a civil infraction citation based on
16 evidence from the automated traffic enforcement system for the
17 same violation for which the peace officer issued the person the
18 citation.
19 7. A violation described in subsection 1 for which a civil
20 infraction citation is issued pursuant to NRS 484A.7035:
21 (a) Is not a moving traffic violation under NRS 483.473; and
22 (b) Is punishable by a civil penalty pursuant to
23 NRS 484A.7043.
24 8. As used in this section, “automated traffic enforcement
25 system” means a stationary electronic or digital system which
26 creates a photograph or other recorded image of a vehicle and
27 vehicle license plate which is used as evidence of a violation of a
28 traffic law by the driver of the vehicle. Such a photograph or other
29 recorded image must not reveal the face of the driver or any other
30 passenger in the vehicle.
31 Sec. 3. NRS 484A.600 is hereby amended to read as follows:
32 484A.600 [A] Except as otherwise provided in section 2 of
33 this act, a governmental entity and any agent thereof shall not use
34 photographic, video or digital equipment for gathering evidence to
35 be used for the issuance of a traffic citation or civil infraction
36 citation pursuant to NRS 484A.7035 for a violation of chapters
37 484A to 484E, inclusive, of NRS unless the equipment is a portable
38 camera or event recording device worn or held by a peace officer,
39 the equipment is otherwise installed temporarily or permanently
40 within a vehicle or facility of a law enforcement agency or the
41 equipment is privately owned by a nongovernmental entity.
42 Sec. 4. NRS 484A.640 is hereby amended to read as follows:
43 484A.640 1. Except for a citation issued pursuant to NRS
44 484A.700 [,] or section 2 of this act, whenever a police officer
45 makes an arrest or issues a citation to a person for any violation of
-
*AB402*

– 5 –
1 chapters 484A to 484E, inclusive, of NRS, the police officer shall
2 record the name as given by that person, the number of the person’s
3 driver’s license and a brief description of the person’s physical
4 appearance. This information must be maintained in a record for
5 offenses kept at the traffic enforcement agency which employs that
6 officer.
7 2. Whenever a police officer stops a driver of a motor vehicle
8 for any violation of chapters 484A to 484E, inclusive, of NRS and
9 requests information from a traffic enforcement agency concerning
10 that person’s record of prior offenses, the police officer shall
11 compare not only the driver’s name but also the number of his or her
12 driver’s license and physical description with any information
13 obtained from the agency as a result of the request. If the
14 information received from the agency indicates that the driver’s
15 name is on an outstanding warrant for a prior offense, the officer
16 shall not arrest the driver for that prior offense unless the additional
17 information used for comparison also connects the driver with that
18 prior offense.
19 Sec. 5. NRS 484A.704 is hereby amended to read as follows:
20 484A.704 1. Any person who receives a civil infraction
21 citation pursuant to NRS 484A.7035 , [or] 484A.7049 or section 2
22 of this act shall respond to the citation as provided in this section
23 not later than 90 calendar days after the date on which the citation is
24 issued.
25 2. If a person receiving a civil infraction citation does not
26 contest the determination that the person has committed the civil
27 infraction set forth in the citation, the person must respond to the
28 citation by indicating that the person does not contest the
29 determination and submitting full payment of the monetary penalty,
30 the administrative assessment and any fees to the court specified in
31 the citation, or its traffic violations bureau, in person, by mail or
32 through the Internet or other electronic means.
33 3. If a person receiving a civil infraction citation wishes to
34 contest the determination that the person has committed the civil
35 infraction set forth in the citation, the person must respond by
36 requesting in person, by mail or through the Internet or other
37 electronic means a hearing for that purpose. The court shall notify
38 the person in writing of the time, place and date of the hearing,
39 but the date of the hearing must not be earlier than 9 calendar days
40 after the court provides notice of the hearing.
41 4. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, not less
42 than 30 days before the deadline for a person to respond to a civil
43 infraction citation, the court must send to the address or electronic
44 mail address of the person, as indicated on the civil infraction
45 citation issued to the person, a reminder that the person must

– 6 –
1 respond to the civil infraction citation within 90 calendar days after
2 the date on which the civil infraction citation is issued. If the person
3 agreed to receive communications relating to the civil infraction by
4 text message, the court may send such a notice to the telephone
5 number of the person as indicated on the civil infraction citation. If
6 the person does not respond to the civil infraction citation in the
7 manner specified by subsection 2 or 3 within 90 calendar days after
8 the date on which the civil infraction citation is issued, the court
9 must enter an order pursuant to NRS 484A.7043 finding that the
10 person committed the civil infraction and assessing the monetary
11 penalty and administrative assessments prescribed for the civil
12 infraction. A person who has been issued a civil infraction citation
13 and who fails to respond to the civil infraction citation as required
14 by this section may not appeal an order entered pursuant to this
15 section.
16 5. If any person issued a civil infraction citation fails to appear
17 at a hearing requested pursuant to subsection 3, the court must enter
18 an order pursuant to NRS 484A.7043 finding that the person
19 committed the civil infraction and assessing the monetary penalty
20 and administrative assessments prescribed for the civil infraction. A
21 person who has been issued a civil infraction citation and who fails
22 to appear at a hearing requested pursuant to subsection 3 may not
23 appeal an order entered pursuant to this subsection.
24 6. In addition to any other penalty imposed, any person who is
25 found by the court to have committed a civil infraction pursuant to
26 subsection 5 shall pay the witness fees, per diem allowances, travel
27 expenses and other reimbursement in accordance with NRS 50.225.
28 7. If a court has established a system pursuant to NRS
29 484A.615, any person issued a civil infraction citation may, if
30 authorized by the court, use the system to perform any applicable
31 actions pursuant to this section.
