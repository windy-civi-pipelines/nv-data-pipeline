EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public safety; creating a pilot program authorizing the
Department of Transportation, a local authority and a regional
transportation commission to allow the installation and use of an
automated traffic enforcement system to enforce certain provisions of
law; requiring a peace officer of a traffic enforcement agency having
jurisdiction over the location of an automated traffic enforcement
system to review certain evidence detected by the automated traffic
enforcement system before a citation is issued; establishing
requirements relating to the issuance of a civil infraction citation based
on evidence detected by an automated traffic enforcement system;
creating a rebuttable presumption that the registered owner of a vehicle
is the driver of the vehicle at the time of a violation detected by an
automated traffic enforcement system; requiring the Department to
annually compile and submit certain information to the Director of
the Legislative Counsel Bureau; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits a governmental entity or any agent thereof from using
2 photographic, video or digital equipment to gather evidence in order to issue a traffic citation
3 or civil infraction citation, unless the equipment is: (1) a portable camera or event recording
4 device worn or held by a peace officer; (2) installed within a vehicle or facility of a law
5 enforcement agency; or (3) privately owned by a nongovernmental entity. (NRS 484A.600)
6 Sections [2 and 3] 2.1-2.7 of this bill [create] provide an exception to this prohibition [,] and
7 create a pilot program authorizing the Department of Transportation, a local authority and a
8 regional transportation commission to allow for the installation and use of an automated
9 traffic enforcement system to enforce [provisions of law governing the] certain speed limits
10 in temporary traffic control zones under certain circumstances. Section 2.2 sets forth the
11 conditions for the installation and use of an automated traffic enforcement system and
12 requires an entity which installs such a system to, among other things, carry out a public
13 information campaign before commencing any enforcement.
Assembly Amendment No. 319 to Assembly Bill No. 402 Page 4
14 Section [2] 2.3 requires a peace officer of a traffic enforcement agency with jurisdiction
15 over the location of the automated traffic enforcement system to review the evidence of a
16 violation detected by an automated traffic enforcement system before a civil infraction
17 citation is issued. Section [2] 2.3 also establishes requirements for the contents and delivery of
18 a civil infraction citation issued based upon evidence collected by an automated traffic
19 enforcement system. [Section 2] Finally, section 2.3 creates a rebuttable presumption that the
20 registered owner of a vehicle is the driver of the vehicle at the time of a violation detected by
21 an automated traffic enforcement system and provides a method for rebutting this
22 presumption. [Finally, section 2]
23 Section 2.4 establishes requirements for the storage and transmission of any
24 photograph, recorded image or data created by an automated traffic enforcement
25 system. Section 2.4 also prohibits any entity who manufactures, maintains, produces or
26 provides an automated traffic enforcement system or related services for sale or lease to
27 this State or any political subdivision of this State from contracting to receive payment
28 on the basis of the number of citations issued.
29 Section 2.6 provides that a violation detected by an automated traffic enforcement system
30 is not a moving traffic violation but is punishable by a civil penalty [.] not to exceed $200.
31 Section 2.6 also requires that any funds collected from such civil infractions in excess of
32 the cost and maintenance of the automated traffic enforcement systems be apportioned
33 by the board of county highway commissioners for certain expenses.
34 Section 2.7 requires the Department, a local authority and a regional transportation
35 commission who authorize the installation and use of an automated traffic enforcement
36 system to annually compile certain information and report it to the Director of the
37 Legislative Counsel Bureau for transmittal to the Joint Interim Standing Committee on
38 Growth and Infrastructure.
39 Sections 1, 4 and 5 of this bill make conforming changes to: (1) exclude traffic violations
40 detected by an automated traffic enforcement system from the assessment of demerit points;
41 and (2) provide for the issuance of civil infraction citations for violations detected by an
42 automated traffic enforcement system. Section 5 of this bill also extends the time to
43 respond to such a citation to 120 days.
44 Existing law provides that before a hearing to contest the determination that a
45 person has committed a civil infraction, the person is required to post a bond equal to
46 the amount of the full payment of the monetary penalty, the administrative assessment
47 and any fees specified in the civil infraction citation. (NRS 484A.7041) Section 6 of this
48 bill limits the amount of a bond for a civil infraction citation issued for a violation
49 described in section 2.2 to an amount not to exceed $100. Section 8 of this bill provides
50 that the pilot program expires by limitation on June 30, 2029.

6 and assessing the monetary penalty and administrative assessments prescribed for
7 the civil infraction. A person who has been issued a civil infraction citation and
8 who fails to respond to the civil infraction citation as required by this section may
9 not appeal an order entered pursuant to this section.

4 whether a civil infraction was committed by the person named in the civil infraction
5 citation. The court must find by a preponderance of the evidence that the person
6 named in the civil infraction citation committed a civil infraction. If it has not been
7 established by a preponderance of the evidence that the infraction was committed
8 by the person named in the citation, the court must enter an order dismissing the
9 civil infraction citation in the court’s records. If it has been established by a

21 appellant to pay pursuant to NRS 484A.7043. Any bond must be forfeited if the
22 order of the court is affirmed on appeal; and
23 (c) If a prosecuting attorney does not represent the plaintiff during the
24 proceedings in the justice court or municipal court, the appellate court shall review

~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public safety; creating a pilot program authorizing the
Department of Transportation, a local authority and a regional
transportation commission to allow the installation and use of an
automated traffic enforcement system to enforce certain provisions of
law; requiring a peace officer of a traffic enforcement agency having
jurisdiction over the location of an automated traffic enforcement
system to review certain evidence detected by the automated traffic
enforcement system before a citation is issued; establishing
requirements relating to the issuance of a civil infraction citation based
on evidence detected by an automated traffic enforcement system;
creating a rebuttable presumption that the registered owner of a vehicle
is the driver of the vehicle at the time of a violation detected by an
automated traffic enforcement system; requiring the Department to
annually compile and submit certain information to the Director of
the Legislative Counsel Bureau; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits a governmental entity or any agent thereof from using
2 photographic, video or digital equipment to gather evidence in order to issue a traffic citation
3 or civil infraction citation, unless the equipment is: (1) a portable camera or event recording
4 device worn or held by a peace officer; (2) installed within a vehicle or facility of a law
5 enforcement agency; or (3) privately owned by a nongovernmental entity. (NRS 484A.600)
6 Sections [2 and 3] 2.1-2.7 of this bill [create] provide an exception to this prohibition [,] and
7 create a pilot program authorizing the Department of Transportation, a local authority and a
8 regional transportation commission to allow for the installation and use of an automated
9 traffic enforcement system to enforce [provisions of law governing the] certain speed limits
10 in temporary traffic control zones under certain circumstances. Section 2.2 sets forth the
11 conditions for the installation and use of an automated traffic enforcement system and
12 requires an entity which installs such a system to, among other things, carry out a public
13 information campaign before commencing any enforcement.

Assembly Amendment No. 319 to Assembly Bill No. 402 Page 4
14 Section [2] 2.3 requires a peace officer of a traffic enforcement agency with jurisdiction
15 over the location of the automated traffic enforcement system to review the evidence of a
16 violation detected by an automated traffic enforcement system before a civil infraction
17 citation is issued. Section [2] 2.3 also establishes requirements for the contents and delivery of
18 a civil infraction citation issued based upon evidence collected by an automated traffic
19 enforcement system. [Section 2] Finally, section 2.3 creates a rebuttable presumption that the
20 registered owner of a vehicle is the driver of the vehicle at the time of a violation detected by
21 an automated traffic enforcement system and provides a method for rebutting this
22 presumption. [Finally, section 2]
23 Section 2.4 establishes requirements for the storage and transmission of any
24 photograph, recorded image or data created by an automated traffic enforcement
25 system. Section 2.4 also prohibits any entity who manufactures, maintains, produces or
26 provides an automated traffic enforcement system or related services for sale or lease to
27 this State or any political subdivision of this State from contracting to receive payment
28 on the basis of the number of citations issued.
29 Section 2.6 provides that a violation detected by an automated traffic enforcement system
30 is not a moving traffic violation but is punishable by a civil penalty [.] not to exceed $200.
31 Section 2.6 also requires that any funds collected from such civil infractions in excess of
32 the cost and maintenance of the automated traffic enforcement systems be apportioned
33 by the board of county highway commissioners for certain expenses.
34 Section 2.7 requires the Department, a local authority and a regional transportation
35 commission who authorize the installation and use of an automated traffic enforcement
36 system to annually compile certain information and report it to the Director of the
37 Legislative Counsel Bureau for transmittal to the Joint Interim Standing Committee on
38 Growth and Infrastructure.
39 Sections 1, 4 and 5 of this bill make conforming changes to: (1) exclude traffic violations
40 detected by an automated traffic enforcement system from the assessment of demerit points;
41 and (2) provide for the issuance of civil infraction citations for violations detected by an
42 automated traffic enforcement system. Section 5 of this bill also extends the time to
43 respond to such a citation to 120 days.
44 Existing law provides that before a hearing to contest the determination that a
45 person has committed a civil infraction, the person is required to post a bond equal to
46 the amount of the full payment of the monetary penalty, the administrative assessment
47 and any fees specified in the civil infraction citation. (NRS 484A.7041) Section 6 of this
48 bill limits the amount of a bond for a civil infraction citation issued for a violation
49 described in section 2.2 to an amount not to exceed $100. Section 8 of this bill provides
50 that the pilot program expires by limitation on June 30, 2029.

4 State or a finding by any municipal court or justice court in this State that a person
5 has committed a civil infraction pursuant to NRS 484A.703 to 484A.705, inclusive.
6 The term includes a finding by a juvenile court that a child has violated a traffic law
7 or ordinance other than one governing standing or parking. The term does not

Assembly Amendment No. 319 to Assembly Bill No. 402 Page 5
1 2. The Department shall establish a uniform system of demerit points for
2 various traffic violations occurring within this State affecting the driving privilege
3 of any person who holds a driver’s license issued by the Department and persons
4 deemed to have future driving privileges pursuant to NRS 483.447. The system
5 must be based on the accumulation of demerits during a period of 12 months.
6 3. The system must be uniform in its operation, and the Department shall set
7 up a schedule of demerits for each traffic violation, depending upon the gravity of
8 the violation, on a scale of one demerit point for a minor violation of any traffic law
9 to eight demerit points for an extremely serious violation of the law governing
10 traffic violations. If a conviction of two or more traffic violations committed on a
11 single occasion is obtained, points must be assessed for one offense or civil
12 infraction, and if the point values differ, points must be assessed for the offense or
13 civil infraction having the greater point value. Details of the violation must be
14 submitted to the Department by the court where the conviction or finding is
15 obtained. The Department may provide for a graduated system of demerits within
16 each category of violations according to the extent to which the traffic law was
17 violated.
18 Sec. 2. Chapter 484A of NRS is hereby amended by adding thereto [a new
19 section to read as follows:] the provisions set forth as sections 2.1 to 2.7,

40 signs, including, without limitation:
41 (a) A statement that an automated traffic enforcement system is in use;
42 (b) A statement of the speed limit; and
43 (c) A display which alerts drivers of their current speed.

3 evidence of the violation from the automated traffic enforcement system must be
4 reviewed for accuracy by a peace officer of a traffic enforcement agency with
5 jurisdiction over the location of the automated traffic enforcement system.
6 [3. A]

45 Sec. 3. NRS 484A.600 is hereby amended to read as follows:
46 484A.600 [A] Except as otherwise provided in [section 2] sections 2.1 to 2.7,
47 inclusive, of this act, a governmental entity and any agent thereof shall not use
48 photographic, video or digital equipment for gathering evidence to be used for the
49 issuance of a traffic citation or civil infraction citation pursuant to NRS 484A.7035
50 for a violation of chapters 484A to 484E, inclusive, of NRS unless the equipment is
51 a portable camera or event recording device worn or held by a peace officer, the
52 equipment is otherwise installed temporarily or permanently within a vehicle or

Assembly Amendment No. 319 to Assembly Bill No. 402 Page 8
1 facility of a law enforcement agency or the equipment is privately owned by a
2 nongovernmental entity.
3 Sec. 4. NRS 484A.640 is hereby amended to read as follows:
4 484A.640 1. Except for a citation issued pursuant to NRS 484A.700 [,] or

6 police officer makes an arrest or issues a citation to a person for any violation of
7 chapters 484A to 484E, inclusive, of NRS, the police officer shall record the name
8 as given by that person, the number of the person’s driver’s license and a brief
9 description of the person’s physical appearance. This information must be
10 maintained in a record for offenses kept at the traffic enforcement agency which
11 employs that officer.
12 2. Whenever a police officer stops a driver of a motor vehicle for any
13 violation of chapters 484A to 484E, inclusive, of NRS and requests information
14 from a traffic enforcement agency concerning that person’s record of prior offenses,
15 the police officer shall compare not only the driver’s name but also the number of
16 his or her driver’s license and physical description with any information obtained
17 from the agency as a result of the request. If the information received from the
18 agency indicates that the driver’s name is on an outstanding warrant for a prior
19 offense, the officer shall not arrest the driver for that prior offense unless the
20 additional information used for comparison also connects the driver with that prior
21 offense.
22 Sec. 5. NRS 484A.704 is hereby amended to read as follows:
23 484A.704 1. Any person who receives a civil infraction citation pursuant to
24 :

30 respond to the citation as provided in this section not later than 120 days after the
31 date on which the citation is issued.
32 2. If a person receiving a civil infraction citation does not contest the
33 determination that the person has committed the civil infraction set forth in the
34 citation, the person must respond to the citation by indicating that the person does
35 not contest the determination and submitting full payment of the monetary penalty,
36 the administrative assessment and any fees to the court specified in the citation, or
37 its traffic violations bureau, in person, by mail or through the Internet or other
38 electronic means.
39 3. If a person receiving a civil infraction citation wishes to contest the
40 determination that the person has committed the civil infraction set forth in the
41 citation, the person must respond by requesting in person, by mail or through the
42 Internet or other electronic means a hearing for that purpose. The court shall notify
43 the person in writing of the time, place and date of the hearing, but the date of the
44 hearing must not be earlier than 9 calendar days after the court provides notice of
45 the hearing.
46 4. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, not less than 30 days
47 before the deadline for a person to respond to a civil infraction citation, the court
48 must send to the address or electronic mail address of the person, as indicated on
49 the civil infraction citation issued to the person, a reminder that the person must
50 respond to the civil infraction citation within 90 or 120 calendar days , as
51 applicable under subsection 1, after the date on which the civil infraction citation
52 is issued. If the person agreed to receive communications relating to the civil
53 infraction by text message, the court may send such a notice to the telephone

Assembly Amendment No. 319 to Assembly Bill No. 402 Page 9
1 number of the person as indicated on the civil infraction citation. If the person does
2 not respond to the civil infraction citation in the manner specified by subsection 2
3 or 3 within 90 or 120 calendar days , as applicable under subsection 1, after the
4 date on which the civil infraction citation is issued, the court must enter an order
5 pursuant to NRS 484A.7043 finding that the person committed the civil infraction
6 and assessing the monetary penalty and administrative assessments prescribed for
7 the civil infraction. A person who has been issued a civil infraction citation and
8 who fails to respond to the civil infraction citation as required by this section may
9 not appeal an order entered pursuant to this section.
10 5. If any person issued a civil infraction citation fails to appear at a hearing
11 requested pursuant to subsection 3, the court must enter an order pursuant to NRS
12 484A.7043 finding that the person committed the civil infraction and assessing the
13 monetary penalty and administrative assessments prescribed for the civil infraction.
14 A person who has been issued a civil infraction citation and who fails to appear at a
15 hearing requested pursuant to subsection 3 may not appeal an order entered
16 pursuant to this subsection.
17 6. In addition to any other penalty imposed, any person who is found by the
18 court to have committed a civil infraction pursuant to subsection 5 shall pay the
19 witness fees, per diem allowances, travel expenses and other reimbursement in
20 accordance with NRS 50.225.
21 7. If a court has established a system pursuant to NRS 484A.615, any person
22 issued a civil infraction citation may, if authorized by the court, use the system to
23 perform any applicable actions pursuant to this section.
24 Sec. 6. NRS 484A.7041 is hereby amended to read as follows:
25 484A.7041 1. If, pursuant to subsection 3 of NRS 484A.704, a person
26 receiving a civil infraction citation requests a hearing to contest the determination
27 that the person has committed the civil infraction set forth in the citation, the
28 hearing must be conducted in accordance with this section.
29 2. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, before a hearing to contest
30 the determination that a person has committed a civil infraction, the court shall
31 require the person to post a bond equal to the amount of the full payment of the
32 monetary penalty, the administrative assessment and any fees specified in the civil
33 infraction citation. Any bond required to be posted for a civil infraction citation
34 issued pursuant to NRS 484A.7035 for a violation described in section 2.2 of this
35 act must not exceed $100. In lieu of posting such a bond, the person may instead
36 deposit cash with the court in the amount of the bond required pursuant to this
37 subsection. Any bond posted or cash deposited with the court pursuant to this
38 subsection must be forfeited upon the court’s finding that the person committed the
39 civil infraction. Any person whom the court determines is unable to pay the costs of
40 defending the action or is a client of a program for legal aid in accordance with
41 NRS 12.015 must not be required to post a bond or deposit cash with the court in
42 accordance with this subsection.
43 3. The person who requested the hearing may, at his or her expense, be
44 represented by counsel, and a city attorney or district attorney, in his or her
45 discretion and as applicable, may represent the plaintiff.
46 4. A hearing conducted pursuant to this section must be conducted by the
47 court without a jury. In lieu of the personal appearance at the hearing by the peace
48 officer who issued the civil infraction citation, the court may consider the
49 information contained in the civil infraction citation and any other written statement
50 submitted under oath by the peace officer. If the court has established a system
51 pursuant to NRS 484A.615, the peace officer may, if authorized by the court, use
52 the system to submit such a statement. The person named in the civil infraction
53 citation may subpoena witnesses, including, without limitation, the peace officer

1 who issued the citation, and has the right to present evidence and examine
2 witnesses present in court.
3 5. After consideration of the evidence and argument, the court shall determine
4 whether a civil infraction was committed by the person named in the civil infraction
5 citation. The court must find by a preponderance of the evidence that the person
6 named in the civil infraction citation committed a civil infraction. If it has not been
7 established by a preponderance of the evidence that the infraction was committed
8 by the person named in the citation, the court must enter an order dismissing the
9 civil infraction citation in the court’s records. If it has been established by a
10 preponderance of the evidence that the infraction was committed, the court must
11 enter in the court’s records an order pursuant to NRS 484A.7043.
12 6. An appeal from the court’s determination or order may be taken in the
13 same manner as any other civil appeal from a municipal court or justice court, as
14 applicable, except that:
15 (a) The notice of appeal must be filed not later than 7 calendar days after the
16 court enters in the court’s records an order pursuant to NRS 484A.7043;
17 (b) If the appellant is the person charged with the civil infraction, any bond
18 required to be given by the appellant in order to secure a stay of execution of the
19 order of the court during the pendency of the appeal must equal the amount of the
20 monetary penalty and administrative assessments which the court has ordered the
21 appellant to pay pursuant to NRS 484A.7043. Any bond must be forfeited if the
22 order of the court is affirmed on appeal; and
23 (c) If a prosecuting attorney does not represent the plaintiff during the
24 proceedings in the justice court or municipal court, the appellate court shall review
25 the record and any arguments presented by the person charged with the civil
26 infraction and render a decision.
27 Sec. 7. The provisions of subsection 1 of NRS 218D.380 do not apply to
28 any provision of this act which adds or revises a requirement to submit a
29 report to the Legislature.
30 Sec. 8. This act becomes effective on July 1, 2025, and expires by
31 limitation on June 30, 2029.
