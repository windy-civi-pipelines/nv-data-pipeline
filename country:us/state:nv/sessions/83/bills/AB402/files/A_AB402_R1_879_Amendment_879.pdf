EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public safety; creating a pilot program authorizing the
Department of Transportation, a local authority and a regional
transportation commission to allow the installation and use of an
automated traffic enforcement system to enforce certain provisions of
law; requiring a peace officer of a traffic enforcement agency having
jurisdiction over the location of an automated traffic enforcement
system to review certain evidence detected by the automated traffic
enforcement system before a citation is issued; establishing
requirements relating to the issuance of a civil infraction citation based
on evidence detected by an automated traffic enforcement system;
creating a rebuttable presumption that the registered owner of a vehicle
is the driver of the vehicle at the time of a violation detected by an
automated traffic enforcement system; requiring the Department to
annually compile and submit certain information to the Director of the
Legislative Counsel Bureau; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits a governmental entity or any agent thereof from using
2 photographic, video or digital equipment to gather evidence in order to issue a traffic citation
3 or civil infraction citation, unless the equipment is: (1) a portable camera or event recording
4 device worn or held by a peace officer; (2) installed within a vehicle or facility of a law
5 enforcement agency; or (3) privately owned by a nongovernmental entity. (NRS 484A.600)
6 Sections 2.1-2.7 of this bill provide an exception to this prohibition and create a pilot program
7 authorizing the Department of Transportation, a local authority and a regional transportation
8 commission to allow for the installation and use of an automated traffic enforcement system to
9 enforce certain speed limits in temporary traffic control zones under certain circumstances.
10 Section 2.2 sets forth the conditions for the installation and use of an automated traffic
11 enforcement system and requires an entity which installs such a system to, among other
12 things, carry out a public information campaign before commencing any enforcement.
13 Section 2.3 requires a peace officer of a traffic enforcement agency with jurisdiction over
14 the location of the automated traffic enforcement system to review the evidence of a violation

Assembly Amendment No. 879 to Assembly Bill No. 402 First Reprint Page 4
15 detected by an automated traffic enforcement system before a civil infraction citation is
16 issued. Section 2.3 also establishes requirements for the contents and delivery of a civil
17 infraction citation issued based upon evidence collected by an automated traffic enforcement
18 system. Finally, section 2.3 creates a rebuttable presumption that the registered owner of a
19 vehicle is the driver of the vehicle at the time of a violation detected by an automated traffic
20 enforcement system and provides a method for rebutting this presumption.
21 Section 2.4 establishes requirements for the storage and transmission of any photograph,
22 recorded image or data created by an automated traffic enforcement system. Section 2.4 also
23 prohibits any entity that manufactures, maintains, produces or provides an automated traffic
24 enforcement system or related services for sale or lease to this State or any political
25 subdivision of this State from contracting to receive payment on the basis of the number of
26 citations issued.
27 Section 2.6 provides that a violation detected by an automated traffic enforcement system
28 is not a moving traffic violation but is punishable by a civil penalty not to exceed $200.
29 Section 2.6 also requires that any funds collected from such civil infractions in excess of the
30 cost and maintenance of the automated traffic enforcement systems be apportioned by the
31 board of county highway commissioners for certain expenses.
32 Section 2.7 requires the Department, a local authority and a regional transportation
33 commission who authorize the installation and use of an automated traffic enforcement system
34 to annually compile certain information and report it to the Director of the Legislative Counsel
35 Bureau for transmittal to the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Growth and Infrastructure.
36 Sections 1, 4 and 5 of this bill make conforming changes to: (1) exclude traffic violations
37 detected by an automated traffic enforcement system from the assessment of demerit points;
38 and (2) provide for the issuance of civil infraction citations for violations detected by an
39 automated traffic enforcement system. Section 5 of this bill also extends the time to respond
40 to such a citation to 120 days.
41 Existing law provides that before a hearing to contest the determination that a person has
42 committed a civil infraction, the person is required to post a bond equal to the amount of the
43 full payment of the monetary penalty, the administrative assessment and any fees specified in
44 the civil infraction citation. (NRS 484A.7041) Section 6 of this bill limits the amount of a
45 bond for a civil infraction citation issued for a violation described in section 2.2 to an amount
46 not to exceed $100. Section 8 of this bill provides that the pilot program expires by limitation
47 on June 30, 2029.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 483.473 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 483.473 1. As used in this section, “traffic violation” means conviction of a
3 moving traffic violation in any municipal court, justice court or district court in this
4 State or a finding by any municipal court or justice court in this State that a person
5 has committed a civil infraction pursuant to NRS 484A.703 to 484A.705, inclusive.
6 The term includes a finding by a juvenile court that a child has violated a traffic law
7 or ordinance other than one governing standing or parking. The term does not
8 include [a] :
9 (a) A conviction or a finding by a juvenile court of a violation of the speed
10 limit posted by a public authority under the circumstances described in subsection 1
11 of NRS 484B.617 [.] ; or
12 (b) A civil infraction citation issued pursuant to NRS 484A.7035 for a
13 violation described in section 2.2 of this act.
14 2. The Department shall establish a uniform system of demerit points for
15 various traffic violations occurring within this State affecting the driving privilege
16 of any person who holds a driver’s license issued by the Department and persons
17 deemed to have future driving privileges pursuant to NRS 483.447. The system
18 must be based on the accumulation of demerits during a period of 12 months.

Assembly Amendment No. 879 to Assembly Bill No. 402 First Reprint Page 5
1 3. The system must be uniform in its operation, and the Department shall set
2 up a schedule of demerits for each traffic violation, depending upon the gravity of
3 the violation, on a scale of one demerit point for a minor violation of any traffic law
4 to eight demerit points for an extremely serious violation of the law governing
5 traffic violations. If a conviction of two or more traffic violations committed on a
6 single occasion is obtained, points must be assessed for one offense or civil
7 infraction, and if the point values differ, points must be assessed for the offense or
8 civil infraction having the greater point value. Details of the violation must be
9 submitted to the Department by the court where the conviction or finding is
10 obtained. The Department may provide for a graduated system of demerits within
11 each category of violations according to the extent to which the traffic law was
12 violated.
13 Sec. 2. Chapter 484A of NRS is hereby amended by adding thereto the
14 provisions set forth as sections 2.1 to 2.7, inclusive, of this act.
15 Sec. 2.1. As used in sections 2.1 to 2.7, inclusive, of this act, unless the
16 context otherwise requires, “automated traffic enforcement system” means a
17 manned or unmanned stationary electronic or digital system which creates a
18 photograph or other recorded image of a vehicle and vehicle license plate which
19 is used as evidence of a violation of a traffic law by the driver of the vehicle. Such
20 a photograph or other recorded image must not reveal the face of the driver or
21 any other passenger in the vehicle.
22 Sec. 2.2. 1. The Department of Transportation, a local authority and a
23 regional transportation commission as defined in NRS 482.1825 may, except as
24 otherwise provided in subsection 3, authorize the installation and use of an
25 automated traffic enforcement system to enforce any rate of speed which is 10
26 miles per hour or more over the posted speed limit:
27 (a) In an area designated as a temporary traffic control zone in which
28 construction, maintenance or repair of a highway is conducted; and
29 (b) At a time when the workers who are performing the construction,
30 maintenance or repair of the highway are present.
31 2. An automated traffic enforcement system must be accompanied by
32 warning signs installed at the entry point of the temporary traffic control zone.
33 The Department shall adopt regulations setting forth standards for such warning
34 signs, including, without limitation:
35 (a) A statement that an automated traffic enforcement system is in use;
36 (b) A statement of the speed limit; and
37 (c) A display which alerts drivers of their current speed.
38 3. Before commencing any enforcement, including the issuance of a civil
39 infraction citation pursuant to NRS 484A.7035 for a violation described in this
40 section, the Department, a local authority or a regional transportation
41 commission as defined in NRS 482.1825 that installs an automated traffic
42 enforcement system shall establish and carry out a public information campaign
43 to:
44 (a) Raise public awareness of the proposed use of an automated traffic
45 enforcement system not less than 30 days before commencing any enforcement;
46 and
47 (b) Inform the public of the date upon which enforcement will begin.
48 Sec. 2.3. 1. Before a civil infraction citation is issued pursuant to NRS
49 484A.7035 for a violation described in section 2.2 of this act, the evidence of the
50 violation from the automated traffic enforcement system must be reviewed for
51 accuracy by a peace officer of a traffic enforcement agency with jurisdiction over
52 the location of the automated traffic enforcement system.

Assembly Amendment No. 879 to Assembly Bill No. 402 First Reprint Page 6
1 2. If after reviewing the evidence described in subsection 1, the peace
2 officer determines that a violation described in section 2.2 of this act occurred,
3 the peace officer shall cause a civil infraction citation to be issued pursuant to
4 NRS 484A.7035. The citation must be sent by the traffic enforcement agency
5 described in subsection 1 or its designee by first class mail to the address listed
6 with the Department of Motor Vehicles for the registered owner of the vehicle
7 identified by the automated traffic enforcement system.
8 3. A manual or automated record prepared by a traffic enforcement agency
9 described in subsection 1 or its designee in the ordinary course of business shall
10 be prima facie evidence of mailing and service, and is admissible in any hearing
11 as to the facts contained in the civil infraction citation.
12 4. In addition to the information required pursuant to subsection 1 of NRS
13 484A.7035, a civil infraction citation issued pursuant to NRS 484A.7035 for a
14 violation described in section 2.2 of this act must include:
15 (a) The date and time of the violation;
16 (b) An image taken by the automated traffic enforcement system showing the
17 vehicle and vehicle license plate involved in the violation or the address of the
18 Internet website on which such an image may be viewed; and
19 (c) A statement summarizing the provisions of subsection 5.
20 5. The registered owner of a vehicle is presumed to be the driver of the
21 vehicle at the time of a violation described in section 2.2 of this act was detected
22 by an automated traffic enforcement system. Such an inference may be rebutted
23 if the registered owner of the vehicle presents as evidence at a hearing held
24 pursuant to subsection 3 of NRS 484A.704, an affidavit stating:
25 (a) The name and address of the person having care, custody and control of
26 the vehicle at the time of the violation; or
27 (b) That the vehicle was, at the time of the violation, stolen. Such an affidavit
28 must be accompanied by evidence that supports the affidavit, including, without
29 limitation, a police report or an insurance report.
30 Sec. 2.4. 1. Any photograph, recorded image or data created by an
31 automated traffic enforcement system:
32 (a) Must only be stored and disseminated by the traffic enforcement agency
33 that issued the civil infraction citation pursuant to NRS 484A.7035 for a violation
34 described in section 2.2 of this act; and
35 (b) May not be sold, transferred or otherwise transmitted by any other entity
36 or organization except pursuant to a court order.
37 2. Any entity that manufactures, maintains, produces or provides an
38 automated traffic enforcement system or related services for sale or lease to this
39 State or any political subdivision of this State shall not contract to receive
40 payment on the basis of the number of civil infraction citations issued pursuant
41 to NRS 484A.7035 for a violation described in section 2.2 of this act.
42 Sec. 2.5. The provisions of sections 2.1 to 2.7, inclusive, of this act do not
43 prohibit a peace officer from issuing a citation for a violation of any law of this
44 State at the place where an automated traffic enforcement system is installed and
45 in use if the peace officer witnesses a violation. A person who is issued a citation
46 by a peace officer pursuant to this section must not be issued a civil infraction
47 citation based on evidence from the automated traffic enforcement system for the
48 same violation for which the peace officer issued the person the citation.
49 Sec. 2.6. 1. A violation described in section 2.2 of this act for which a
50 civil infraction citation is issued pursuant to NRS 484A.7035:
51 (a) Is not a moving traffic violation under NRS 483.473; and
52 (b) Is punishable by a civil penalty pursuant to NRS 484A.7043, not to

4 Transportation, local authority or regional transportation commission as defined
5 in NRS 482.1825, as applicable, and the traffic enforcement agency with
6 jurisdiction over the location of the automated traffic enforcement system and
7 must be used to defray the cost of installing and operating the automated traffic

11 the county, as applicable, to be expended as described in NRS 403.470.
12 Sec. 2.7. 1. Each local authority and regional transportation commission
13 as defined in NRS 482.1825 that authorizes the installation and use of an

39 violation of chapters 484A to 484E, inclusive, of NRS unless the equipment is a
40 portable camera or event recording device worn or held by a peace officer, the
41 equipment is otherwise installed temporarily or permanently within a vehicle or
42 facility of a law enforcement agency or the equipment is privately owned by a
43 nongovernmental entity.
44 Sec. 4. NRS 484A.640 is hereby amended to read as follows:

5 agency indicates that the driver’s name is on an outstanding warrant for a prior
6 offense, the officer shall not arrest the driver for that prior offense unless the
7 additional information used for comparison also connects the driver with that prior
8 offense.
9 Sec. 5. NRS 484A.704 is hereby amended to read as follows:
10 484A.704 1. Any person who receives a civil infraction citation pursuant to

40 number of the person as indicated on the civil infraction citation. If the person does
41 not respond to the civil infraction citation in the manner specified by subsection 2
42 or 3 within 90 or 120 calendar days , as applicable under subsection 1, after the
43 date on which the civil infraction citation is issued, the court must enter an order
44 pursuant to NRS 484A.7043 finding that the person committed the civil infraction
45 and assessing the monetary penalty and administrative assessments prescribed for
46 the civil infraction. A person who has been issued a civil infraction citation and
47 who fails to respond to the civil infraction citation as required by this section may
48 not appeal an order entered pursuant to this section.
49 5. If any person issued a civil infraction citation fails to appear at a hearing
50 requested pursuant to subsection 3, the court must enter an order pursuant to NRS
51 484A.7043 finding that the person committed the civil infraction and assessing the
52 monetary penalty and administrative assessments prescribed for the civil infraction.
53 A person who has been issued a civil infraction citation and who fails to appear at a

Assembly Amendment No. 879 to Assembly Bill No. 402 First Reprint Page 9
1 hearing requested pursuant to subsection 3 may not appeal an order entered
2 pursuant to this subsection.
3 6. In addition to any other penalty imposed, any person who is found by the
4 court to have committed a civil infraction pursuant to subsection 5 shall pay the
5 witness fees, per diem allowances, travel expenses and other reimbursement in
6 accordance with NRS 50.225.
7 7. If a court has established a system pursuant to NRS 484A.615, any person

10 Sec. 6. NRS 484A.7041 is hereby amended to read as follows:
11 484A.7041 1. If, pursuant to subsection 3 of NRS 484A.704, a person
12 receiving a civil infraction citation requests a hearing to contest the determination
13 that the person has committed the civil infraction set forth in the citation, the
14 hearing must be conducted in accordance with this section.
15 2. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, before a hearing to contest
16 the determination that a person has committed a civil infraction, the court shall
17 require the person to post a bond equal to the amount of the full payment of the
18 monetary penalty, the administrative assessment and any fees specified in the civil
19 infraction citation. Any bond required to be posted for a civil infraction citation
20 issued pursuant to NRS 484A.7035 for a violation described in section 2.2 of this
21 act must not exceed $100. In lieu of posting such a bond, the person may instead
22 deposit cash with the court in the amount of the bond required pursuant to this
23 subsection. Any bond posted or cash deposited with the court pursuant to this
24 subsection must be forfeited upon the court’s finding that the person committed the
25 civil infraction. Any person whom the court determines is unable to pay the costs of
26 defending the action or is a client of a program for legal aid in accordance with
27 NRS 12.015 must not be required to post a bond or deposit cash with the court in
28 accordance with this subsection.
29 3. The person who requested the hearing may, at his or her expense, be
30 represented by counsel, and a city attorney or district attorney, in his or her
31 discretion and as applicable, may represent the plaintiff.
32 4. A hearing conducted pursuant to this section must be conducted by the
33 court without a jury. In lieu of the personal appearance at the hearing by the peace
34 officer who issued the civil infraction citation, the court may consider the
35 information contained in the civil infraction citation and any other written statement
36 submitted under oath by the peace officer. If the court has established a system
37 pursuant to NRS 484A.615, the peace officer may, if authorized by the court, use
38 the system to submit such a statement. The person named in the civil infraction
39 citation may subpoena witnesses, including, without limitation, the peace officer
40 who issued the citation, and has the right to present evidence and examine
41 witnesses present in court.
42 5. After consideration of the evidence and argument, the court shall determine
43 whether a civil infraction was committed by the person named in the civil infraction
44 citation. The court must find by a preponderance of the evidence that the person
45 named in the civil infraction citation committed a civil infraction. If it has not been
46 established by a preponderance of the evidence that the infraction was committed
47 by the person named in the citation, the court must enter an order dismissing the
48 civil infraction citation in the court’s records. If it has been established by a
49 preponderance of the evidence that the infraction was committed, the court must
50 enter in the court’s records an order pursuant to NRS 484A.7043.
51 6. An appeal from the court’s determination or order may be taken in the
52 same manner as any other civil appeal from a municipal court or justice court, as
53 applicable, except that:

1 (a) The notice of appeal must be filed not later than 7 calendar days after the
2 court enters in the court’s records an order pursuant to NRS 484A.7043;
3 (b) If the appellant is the person charged with the civil infraction, any bond
4 required to be given by the appellant in order to secure a stay of execution of the
5 order of the court during the pendency of the appeal must equal the amount of the
6 monetary penalty and administrative assessments which the court has ordered the
7 appellant to pay pursuant to NRS 484A.7043. Any bond must be forfeited if the
8 order of the court is affirmed on appeal; and
9 (c) If a prosecuting attorney does not represent the plaintiff during the
10 proceedings in the justice court or municipal court, the appellate court shall review
11 the record and any arguments presented by the person charged with the civil
12 infraction and render a decision.
