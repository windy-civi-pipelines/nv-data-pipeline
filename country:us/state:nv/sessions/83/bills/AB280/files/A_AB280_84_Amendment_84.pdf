Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth certain requirements relating to a written rental agreement for the
2 use and occupancy of a dwelling unit or premises, including, without limitation, that the
3 agreement contain provisions relating to fees which are required and the purposes for which
4 they are required. (NRS 118A.200) Section 2 of this bill: (1) provides that such a rental
5 agreement also include a separate appendix that contains a clear and concise explanation of
6 each fee that may be charged during the term of the rental agreement and the purpose for
7 which the fee may be charged; (2) requires such appendix to state with specificity for each fee
8 that is variable, that the tenant pays the actual cost incurred by the tenant, and, for each fee
9 that is fixed or provided by a third-party vendor, the tenant pays the current amount of the fee;
10 and (3) makes it unlawful for a landlord or other person authorized to enter into a rental
11 agreement on his or her behalf to charge a tenant a fee in an amount or for any purpose that is
12 not set forth in such an appendix. Section 2 further requires such a rental agreement to include
13 a separate appendix that contains a clear and concise explanation of the rights of the tenant
14 pursuant to federal and state laws and local ordinances.
15 Section 1 of this bill requires a landlord who collects from a prospective tenant any fee to
16 apply to rent a dwelling unit to refund the fee if the landlord: (1) rents the dwelling unit to a
17 different prospective tenant; and (2) does not conduct the activity for which the fee was
18 collected.
19 Section 1 further prohibits a landlord from collecting an application fee, a fee to obtain a
20 credit report or a fee to obtain a background check for a minor who is a member of the
21 household of the prospective tenant.

26 percent of the rent payable by the existing tenant pursuant to the rental agreement that is in
27 effect on June 30, 2025. Section 3 further defines “tenant” to mean a person who is entitled
