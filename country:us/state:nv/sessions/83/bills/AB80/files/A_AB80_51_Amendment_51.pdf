47 may be prepared from those public books and public records. Any such copies,
48 abstracts or memoranda may be used to supply the general public with copies,
49 abstracts or memoranda of the records or may be used in any other way to the
50 advantage of the governmental entity or of the general public. This section does not
51 supersede or in any manner affect the federal laws governing copyrights or enlarge,
52 diminish or affect in any other manner the rights of a person in any written book or
53 record which is copyrighted pursuant to federal law.

Assembly Amendment No. 51 to Assembly Bill No. 80 Page 22
1 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record which is
2 copyrighted solely because it is copyrighted.
3 3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a public book or
4 record shall not deny a request made pursuant to subsection 1 to inspect or copy or
5 receive a copy of a public book or record on the basis that the requested public
6 book or record contains information that is confidential if the governmental entity
7 can redact, delete, conceal or separate, including, without limitation, electronically,
8 the confidential information from the information included in the public book or
9 record that is not otherwise confidential.
10 4. If requested, a governmental entity shall provide a copy of a public record
11 in an electronic format by means of an electronic medium. Nothing in this

13 electronic format or by means of an electronic medium if:
14 (a) The public record:
15 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
16 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
17 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by means of an
18 electronic medium would:
19 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
20 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential and that
21 cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from information that is not
22 otherwise confidential.
23 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who has legal
24 custody or control of a public record:
25 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the medium that
26 is requested because the officer, employee or agent has already prepared or would
27 prefer to provide the copy in a different medium.
28 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon request, prepare
29 the copy of the public record and shall not require the person who has requested the
30 copy to prepare the copy himself or herself.
31 Sec. 59. NRS 318A.280 is hereby amended to read as follows:
32 318A.280 1. In any region of this State for which there has been established
33 by interstate compact a regional planning agency, the powers of any district created
34 pursuant to this chapter with respect to the location and construction of all facilities,
35 improvements or projects are subordinate to the powers of such regional planning
36 agency.
37 2. If the boundaries of a district overlap with the boundaries of a conservation
38 district formed pursuant to [chapter 548 of] NRS [,] 548.010 to 548.550, inclusive,
39 the board of the district must coordinate and consult with the board of supervisors
40 of the conservation district on matters that may impact the conservation district.
41 Sec. 60. [1. There is hereby appropriated from the State General Fund to
42 the Conservation Districts Program in the State Department of Conservation and
43 Natural Resources the sum of $250,000 for providing staff services to the State
44 Conservation Commission in the State Department of Conservation and Natural
45 Resources in administering the Healthy Soils Initiative created by section 7 of this
46 act, and for the salary of an employee to assist the Commission in carrying out the
47 provisions of sections 2 to 12, inclusive, of this act.
48 2. Any remaining balance of the appropriation made by subsection 1 must not
49 be committed for expenditure after June 30, 2027, by the entity to which the
50 appropriation is made or any entity to which money from the appropriation is
51 granted or otherwise transferred in any manner, and any portion of the appropriated
52 money remaining must not be spent for any purpose after September 17, 2027, by
53 either the entity to which the money was appropriated or the entity to which the

Assembly Amendment No. 51 to Assembly Bill No. 80 Page 23
1 money was subsequently granted or transferred, and must be reverted to the State
2 General Fund on or before September 17, 2027.] (Deleted by amendment.)
3 Sec. 60.3. Beginning on January 1, 2036, the State Conservation
4 Commission in the State Department of Conservation and Natural Resources
5 shall study the results of the Healthy Soils Initiative created by section 7 of this
6 act to determine whether the Initiative has made significant progress toward
7 achieving the requirements of subsection 1 of section 7 of this act, as
8 determined by the State Conservation Commission, and submit to the Director
9 of the Legislative Counsel Bureau, for transmittal to the next regular session of
10 the Legislature, a written report which must detail the progress made toward
11 meeting the requirements of subsection 1 of section 7 of this act. If the
12 Commission determines that there has not been significant progress, the
13 Commission shall:
14 1. Establish additional measures set forth in subsection 2 of section 7 of
15 this act or section 8 of this act to meet the requirements of subsection 1 of
16 section 7 of this act; or
17 2. Recommend to the Legislature in the written report that the
18 Legislature repeal the provisions of sections 1 to 61, inclusive, of this act
19 relating to the Healthy Soils Initiative.
20 Sec. 60.7. The provisions of NRS 218D.380 do not apply to any provision
21 of this act which adds or revises a requirement to submit a report to the
22 Legislature.
23 Sec. 61. 1. This section and section 60 of this act become effective upon
24 passage and approval.
25 2. Sections 1 to 59, inclusive, and 60.3 and 60.7 of this act become effective:
26 (a) Upon passage and approval for the purpose of adopting any regulations and
27 performing any other preparatory administrative tasks that are necessary to carry
28 out the provisions of this act; and
29 (b) On January 1, 2026, for all other purposes.
