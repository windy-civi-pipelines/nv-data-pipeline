8 diminish or affect in any other manner the rights of a person in any
9 written book or record which is copyrighted pursuant to federal law.
10 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record

12 3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a
13 public book or record shall not deny a request made pursuant to

22 public record in an electronic format by means of an electronic
23 medium. Nothing in this subsection requires a governmental entity

27 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
28 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
29 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by
30 means of an electronic medium would:
31 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
32 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential
33 and that cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from
34 information that is not otherwise confidential.
35 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who
36 has legal custody or control of a public record:
37 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the

39 already prepared or would prefer to provide the copy in a different
40 medium.
41 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon
42 request, prepare the copy of the public record and shall not require

7 Healthy Soils Initiative. The Advisory Board consists of: (1) nine voting members,
8 including six members who represent certain agricultural interests in this State; and
9 (2) any other nonvoting member appointed by the Commission to provide any
10 necessary assistance or technical or scientific expertise.
11 Section 7 of this bill creates the Healthy Soils Initiative within the
12 Commission, which must: (1) encourage the adoption of soil health practices by
13 agricultural producers; (2) promote and advance the understanding of the
14 environmental and economic benefits of soil health practices; and (3) support and
15 advance scientific research into soil health.
16 Section 8 of this bill authorizes the Commission to establish, as part of the
17 Healthy Soils Initiative: (1) a grant program for soil health activities and projects;
18 (2) a soil health monitoring and inventory platform; and (3) any other program the
19 Commission determines is appropriate. Section 8 requires, with certain exceptions,
20 any program or platform established by the Commission to be voluntary and

32 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential
33 and that cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from
34 information that is not otherwise confidential.
35 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who
36 has legal custody or control of a public record:
