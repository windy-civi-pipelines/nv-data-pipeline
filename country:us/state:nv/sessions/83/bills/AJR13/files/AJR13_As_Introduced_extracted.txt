ASSEMBLY JOINT RESOLUTION—Urging the Federal
Government to maintain the moratorium on the testing of
explosive nuclear weapons.
1 WHEREAS, The United States Congress approved a moratorium
2 on the underground testing of explosive nuclear weapons in 1992;
3 and
4 WHEREAS, The United States signed the Comprehensive
5 Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty in 1996, but has not yet ratified the treaty;
6 and
7 WHEREAS, There have been no test explosions of nuclear
8 weapons in Nevada for over thirty years; and
9 WHEREAS, The Nevada National Security Site, where
10 resumption of the underground testing of explosive nuclear weapons
11 would occur, is located approximately 65 miles northwest of Las
12 Vegas, Nevada; and
13 WHEREAS, The improper underground testing of explosive
14 nuclear weapons could vent and disperse a large amount of
15 radioactive material into the air, as it did in 1970 when an
16 underground test vented 80,000 curies of radioactive contamination
17 across a widespread area of the western United States; and
18 WHEREAS, Radioactive material from previous nuclear tests is
19 still present in the groundwater of some areas of the Nevada
20 National Security Site, and the resumption of underground testing of
-
*AJR13*
– 2 –
1 explosive nuclear weapons could contaminate the groundwater even
2 further with radioactive material; and
3 WHEREAS, Exposure to radiation through the air or groundwater
4 can pose adverse health effects over time, including cancer and
5 other illnesses; and
6 WHEREAS, The underground testing of explosive nuclear
7 weapons could cause tremors in Las Vegas, Nevada, which would
8 resemble a major earthquake; and
9 WHEREAS, The resumption of the testing of explosive nuclear
10 weapons would risk the local Nevada economy by frightening
11 residents and tourists alike; and
12 WHEREAS, When the United States first began testing explosive
13 nuclear weapons at the Nevada Test Site in the 1950s, there was an
14 estimated population in Clark County of 50,000 people. Today there
15 are estimated to be around 2,300,000 people in Clark County, which
16 means there are now far more people who could potentially
17 experience adverse impacts from this testing; and
18 WHEREAS, Over 72 percent of Nevada voters oppose the
19 resumption of underground testing of explosive nuclear weapons;
20 and
21 WHEREAS, Resumption of the underground testing of explosive
22 nuclear weapons in the United States could lead other countries to
23 resume the testing of nuclear weapons, causing a new nuclear arms
24 race; now, therefore, be it
25 RESOLVED BY THE ASSEMBLY AND SENATE OF THE STATE OF
26 NEVADA, JOINTLY, That the United States should maintain and
27 renew its commitment to the moratorium on the testing of explosive
28 nuclear weapons in this country; and be it further
29 RESOLVED, That the United States, in alignment with its signing
30 of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty, should not resume
31 the testing of explosive nuclear weapons at the Nevada National
32 Security Site; and be it further
33 RESOLVED, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly prepare and
34 transmit a copy of this resolution to the President of the United
35 States, the Vice President of the United States as the presiding
36 officer of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives,
37 the United States Secretary of Energy and each member of the
38 Nevada Congressional Delegation; and be it further
39 RESOLVED, That this resolution becomes effective upon
40 passage.
