ASSEMBLY JOINT RESOLUTION—Urging the Federal Government to maintain
the moratorium on the testing of explosive nuclear weapons.
1 WHEREAS, The State of Nevada and its citizens have long contributed to the
2 national security of the United States [Congress approved a moratorium on the
3 underground testing of explosive nuclear weapons in 1992;] by hosting the
4 Nevada National Security Site, formerly the Nevada Test Site, where a total of
5 100 atmospheric tests and 828 underground tests were conducted; and
6 WHEREAS, [The] After sustained advocacy by Nevadans, the era of
7 explosive nuclear testing in the United States [signed the Comprehensive Nuclear
8 Test-Ban Treaty in 1996, but has not yet ratified the treaty;] ended in 1992 when a
9 moratorium on underground nuclear testing was passed by bipartisan
10 majorities in the United States Congress and signed into law by President
11 George H.W. Bush, and the moratorium has been voluntarily upheld by every
12 president for over 30 years; and
13 WHEREAS, [There have been no test explosions of nuclear weapons in Nevada
14 for over thirty years;] Former national security officials and other Washington-
15 based research organizations have recently called for renewed explosive
16 nuclear testing which, if adopted, would occur underground at the Nevada
17 National Security Site in Nye County, just 65 miles from Las Vegas, Nevada,
18 and would introduce environmental, health and economic risks to all
19 Nevadans; and
20 WHEREAS, [The] When the Federal Government first selected the Nevada
21 [National Security] Test Site [, where resumption of the underground] for nuclear
22 testing [of explosive nuclear weapons would occur, is located approximately 65
23 miles northwest of Las Vegas, Nevada;] , an estimated 57,000 people lived in
24 Clark County and the five nearby rural counties, whereas today these counties
25 are home to more than 2.3 million people; and
26 WHEREAS, [The improper underground] Underground testing of explosive
27 nuclear weapons could [vent and disperse a large amount of] inadvertently release
28 radioactive material into the air, as [it did in] has happened in the past with at
29 least 32 venting accidents from underground tests at the Nevada Test Site,
Assembly Amendment No. 211 to Assembly Joint Resolution No. 13 Page 4
1 including the 1970 [when an underground test vented 80,000 curies] Baneberry
2 incident, which released a significant amount of radioactive [contamination]
3 material across a widespread area of the western United States [;] and exposed 86
4 Nevada Test Site workers to high levels of radiation; and
5 WHEREAS, [Radioactive material from previous nuclear tests is still present in
6 the groundwater of some areas of the Nevada National Security Site, and the
7 resumption of underground testing of explosive nuclear weapons could contaminate
8 the groundwater even further with radioactive material;] More than 32,000
9 “Downwinder” claims have been filed as a result of atmospheric testing, and
10 more than 27,000 claims have been filed under the Energy Employees
11 Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act by former Nevada Test Site
12 employees and contractors, demonstrating the impact of nuclear testing on the
13 health of Nevadans; and
14 WHEREAS, Exposure to radiation [through the air or groundwater can pose
15 adverse] from resumed testing of explosive nuclear weapons could result in
16 negative chronic health effects to the local population over time, including cancer
17 , heart disease, neurological disorders, autoimmune disorders and [other
18 illnesses;] thyroid disease; and
19 WHEREAS, [The] Previous underground testing of explosive nuclear weapons
20 [could cause] caused tremors in Las Vegas [, Nevada,] registering as high as 5.7
21 on the Richter scale, which [would resemble a major earthquake;] rattled
22 residents and visitors, underscoring that resumed testing could pose significant
23 risks to the infrastructure, buildings and, ultimately, economy of Nevada,
24 including its tourism and real estate industries; and
25 WHEREAS, [The resumption of the testing of] Resumed explosive nuclear
26 [weapons] testing would [risk the local Nevada economy by frightening residents
27 and tourists alike;] further contaminate local groundwater sources, as evidenced
28 by the environmental reports of the National Nuclear Security Administration
29 indicating radioactive materials in groundwater from previous testing and the
30 known effectiveness of groundwater in dispersing radioactive contamination
31 into the surrounding environment; and
32 WHEREAS, [When the] There is no technical or military requirement to
33 resume nuclear testing, as the Directors of the Los Alamos, Sandia and
34 Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories and the Commander of United
35 States [first began testing explosive] Strategic Command, along with the
36 Secretaries of Defense and Energy, have annually affirmed the safety, security,
37 reliability and performance of nuclear weapons [at the Nevada Test Site in the
38 1950s, there was an estimated population in Clark County of 50,000 people. Today
39 there are estimated to be around 2,300,000 people in Clark County, which means
40 there are now far more people who could potentially experience adverse impacts
41 from this] for over 25 years and have consistently determined there is no
42 technical or military requirement to resume testing; and
43 WHEREAS, [Over 72 percent of Nevada voters oppose the resumption of
44 underground testing of explosive nuclear weapons;] No country other than North
45 Korea has conducted an explosive nuclear test this century, and 187 countries,
46 including the United States, every NATO and United States Pacific ally, Russia
47 and China, are signatories to the 1996 Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban
48 Treaty; and
49 WHEREAS, Resumption of the [underground] testing of explosive nuclear
50 weapons [in] would undermine the national security of the United States [could
51 lead] by encouraging Russia, China and other countries to resume the testing of
52 nuclear weapons [, causing a new] and improve their nuclear [arms race;]
53 arsenals; and
Assembly Amendment No. 211 to Assembly Joint Resolution No. 13 Page 5
1 WHEREAS, The United States has extensive data from having conducted
2 more nuclear tests than any other country, which fuels today’s powerful
3 science-based stockpile stewardship program with cutting edge diagnostic,
4 modeling and computing capabilities that are second to none; and
5 WHEREAS, Polling conducted by the University of Maryland in 2024 found
6 that more than two-thirds of Nevada Republicans and Democrats favor
7 continuing to abide by the moratorium on nuclear testing; now, therefore, be it
8 RESOLVED BY THE ASSEMBLY AND SENATE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, JOINTLY,
9 That the [United States should] members of the 83rd Session of the Nevada
10 Legislature hereby urge the Federal Government to maintain [and renew its
11 commitment to] the moratorium on the testing of explosive nuclear weapons ; [in
12 this country;] and be it further
13 [Resolved, That the United States, in alignment with its signing of the
14 Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty, should not resume the testing of
15 explosive nuclear weapons at the Nevada National Security Site; and be it further]
16 RESOLVED, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly prepare and transmit a copy
17 of this resolution to the President of the United States, the Vice President of the
18 United States as the presiding officer of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of
19 Representatives, the United States Secretary of State, the United States
20 Secretary of Defense, the United States Secretary of Energy, the Under Secretary
21 for the National Nuclear Security Administration and each member of the
22 Nevada Congressional Delegation; and be it further
23 RESOLVED, That this resolution becomes effective upon passage.
