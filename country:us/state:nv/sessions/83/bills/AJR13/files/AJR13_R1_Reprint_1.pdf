ASSEMBLY JOINT RESOLUTION—Urging the Federal
Government to maintain the moratorium on the testing of
explosive nuclear weapons.
1 WHEREAS, The State of Nevada and its citizens have long
2 contributed to the national security of the United States by hosting
3 the Nevada National Security Site, formerly the Nevada Test Site,
4 where a total of 100 atmospheric tests and 828 underground tests
5 were conducted; and
6 WHEREAS, After sustained advocacy by Nevadans, the era of
7 explosive nuclear testing in the United States ended in 1992 when a
8 moratorium on underground nuclear testing was passed by
9 bipartisan majorities in the United States Congress and signed into
10 law by President George H.W. Bush, and the moratorium has been
11 voluntarily upheld by every president for over 30 years; and
12 WHEREAS, Former national security officials and other
13 Washington-based research organizations have recently called for
14 renewed explosive nuclear testing which, if adopted, would occur
15 underground at the Nevada National Security Site in Nye County,
16 just 65 miles from Las Vegas, Nevada, and would introduce
17 environmental, health and economic risks to all Nevadans; and
18 WHEREAS, When the Federal Government first selected the
19 Nevada Test Site for nuclear testing, an estimated 57,000 people

– 2 –
1 lived in Clark County and the five nearby rural counties, whereas
2 today these counties are home to more than 2.3 million people; and
3 WHEREAS, Underground testing of explosive nuclear weapons
4 could inadvertently release radioactive material into the air, as has
5 happened in the past with at least 32 venting accidents from
6 underground tests at the Nevada Test Site, including the 1970
7 Baneberry incident, which released a significant amount of
8 radioactive material across a widespread area of the western United
9 States and exposed 86 Nevada Test Site workers to high levels of
10 radiation; and
11 WHEREAS, More than 32,000 “Downwinder” claims have been
12 filed as a result of atmospheric testing, and more than 27,000 claims
13 have been filed under the Energy Employees Occupational Illness
14 Compensation Program Act by former Nevada Test Site employees
15 and contractors, demonstrating the impact of nuclear testing on the
16 health of Nevadans; and
17 WHEREAS, Exposure to radiation from resumed testing of
18 explosive nuclear weapons could result in negative chronic health
19 effects to the local population over time, including cancer, heart
20 disease, neurological disorders, autoimmune disorders and thyroid
21 disease; and
22 WHEREAS, Previous underground testing of explosive nuclear
23 weapons caused tremors in Las Vegas registering as high as 5.7 on
24 the Richter scale, which rattled residents and visitors, underscoring
25 that resumed testing could pose significant risks to the
26 infrastructure, buildings and, ultimately, economy of Nevada,
27 including its tourism and real estate industries; and
28 WHEREAS, Resumed explosive nuclear testing would further
29 contaminate local groundwater sources, as evidenced by the
30 environmental reports of the National Nuclear Security
31 Administration indicating radioactive materials in groundwater from
32 previous testing and the known effectiveness of groundwater in
33 dispersing radioactive contamination into the surrounding
34 environment; and
35 WHEREAS, There is no technical or military requirement to
36 resume nuclear testing, as the Directors of the Los Alamos, Sandia
37 and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories and the Commander
38 of United States Strategic Command, along with the Secretaries of
39 Defense and Energy, have annually affirmed the safety, security,
40 reliability and performance of nuclear weapons for over 25 years
41 and have consistently determined there is no technical or military
42 requirement to resume testing; and
43 WHEREAS, No country other than North Korea has conducted an
44 explosive nuclear test this century, and 187 countries, including the
45 United States, every NATO and United States Pacific ally, Russia
-

– 3 –
1 and China, are signatories to the 1996 Comprehensive Nuclear Test
2 Ban Treaty; and
3 WHEREAS, Resumption of the testing of explosive nuclear
4 weapons would undermine the national security of the United States
5 by encouraging Russia, China and other countries to resume the
6 testing of nuclear weapons and improve their nuclear arsenals; and
7 WHEREAS, The United States has extensive data from having
8 conducted more nuclear tests than any other country, which fuels
9 today’s powerful science-based stockpile stewardship program with
10 cutting edge diagnostic, modeling and computing capabilities that
11 are second to none; and
12 WHEREAS, Polling conducted by the University of Maryland in
13 2024 found that more than two-thirds of Nevada Republicans and
14 Democrats favor continuing to abide by the moratorium on nuclear
15 testing; now, therefore, be it
16 RESOLVED BY THE ASSEMBLY AND SENATE OF THE STATE OF
17 NEVADA, JOINTLY, That the members of the 83rd Session of the
18 Nevada Legislature hereby urge the Federal Government to
19 maintain the moratorium on the testing of explosive nuclear
20 weapons; and be it further
21 RESOLVED, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly prepare and
22 transmit a copy of this resolution to the President of the United
23 States, the Vice President of the United States as the presiding
24 officer of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives,
25 the United States Secretary of State, the United States Secretary of
26 Defense, the United States Secretary of Energy, the Under Secretary
27 for the National Nuclear Security Administration and each member
28 of the Nevada Congressional Delegation; and be it further
29 RESOLVED, That this resolution becomes effective upon
30 passage.
