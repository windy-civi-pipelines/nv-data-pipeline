Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth the Nevada Certified Court Reporters’ and Licensed
2 Court Reporting Firms’ Law, which provides for the certification and regulation of
3 certified court reporters and the licensure and regulation of court reporting firms by
4 the Certified Court Reporters’ Board of Nevada. (Chapter 656 of NRS) Existing
5 law prohibits a person from engaging in the practice of court reporting without a
6 valid certificate of registration as a certified court reporter. (NRS 656.145, 656.300)
7 Sections 3, 5-10 and 12-15 of this bill provide for the certification and regulation
8 by the Board of persons engaged in the recording of certain proceedings by the use
9 of video cameras or any system of recording simultaneous audio and video. Section
10 5 expands the definitions of: (1) “certificate” to mean a certificate of registration as
11 a court reporter or a certificate of registration as a legal video recorder; (2)
12 “certified court reporter” to mean a person who holds a certificate of registration as
-
*SB191*

– 2 –
13 a court reporter or a certificate as a legal video recorder; and (3) “practice of court
14 reporting” to include video recording in this State certain proceedings, by the use of
15 video cameras or any system of recording simultaneous audio and video. As such,
16 under section 5, a person who engages in the video recording of certain
17 proceedings by the use of video cameras or any system of recording simultaneous
18 audio and video is engaged in the practice of court reporting and is prohibited from
19 doing so without a certificate of registration as a legal video recorder issued by the
20 Board. If such a person obtains such a certificate, under section 5, the person would
21 constitute a certified court reporter.
22 Existing law prohibits a person from conducting business as a court reporting
23 firm without a license issued by the Board. (NRS 656.185) Existing law defines
24 “court reporting firm” to mean, in general, a business that provides or arranges for
25 the services of a certified court reporter or provides referral services for certified
26 court reporters. (NRS 656.030) Because a person who engages in the video
27 recording of certain proceedings and has obtained a certificate or registration as a
28 legal video recorder constitutes a certified court reporter, under section 5, a person
29 is prohibited from providing or arranging services for such video recording or
30 providing referral services for a person who engages in such video recording.
31 Sections 6 and 11 of this bill revise provisions relating to engaging in the
32 practice of court reporting or conducting business as a court reporting firm without
33 a certificate of registration or license issued by the Board, as applicable, to reflect
34 the changes in section 5, which provide that a certified court reporter includes a
35 person who has obtained a certificate of registration as a court reporter or a
36 certificate of registration as a legal video recorder.
37 Existing law authorizes certain courts and magistrates to designate a person
38 who is not a certified court reporter to operate sound recording equipment to record
39 certain proceedings. (NRS 3.380, 4.400, 171.198) Section 2 of this bill exempts
40 such a person from the provisions of the Nevada Certified Court Reporters’ and
41 Licensed Court Reporting Firms’ Law.
42 Section 3 prohibits a person who holds a certificate of registration as a legal
43 video recorder from recording certain proceedings unless another person who holds
44 a certificate of registration as a court reporter is present. Section 3 also prohibits a
45 person who holds only a certificate of registration: (1) as a legal video recorder
46 from engaging in the practices of a person who holds a certificate of registration as
47 a court reporter; and (2) as a court reporter from engaging in the practices of a
48 person who holds a certificate of registration as a legal video recorder. Finally,
49 section 3 prohibits a person who holds both a certificate of registration as a court
50 reporter and a certificate of registration as a legal video recorder from performing
51 both functions simultaneously during the same proceeding. Section 13: (1)
52 authorizes a person who holds a certificate of registration as a legal video recorder
53 to use the title of “certified court reporter-legal video recorder” and the
54 abbreviation “C.C.R.-L.V.R.”; (2) prohibits a person who holds a certificate as a
55 legal video recorder from using any other title or abbreviation applicable to a
56 person who holds a certificate of registration as a court reporter, unless the person
57 also holds another applicable certificate; and (3) prohibits any other person from
58 using the title or abbreviation of a legal video reporter in connection with his or her
59 profession or business, unless the person holds such a certificate of registration.
60 Section 4 of this bill authorizes a person who is not a party to certain civil
61 proceedings to request a copy of a transcript or video record media of the
62 proceeding from a certified court reporter or court reporting firm with possession of
63 the transcript or video record media. Upon receipt of such a request, section 4
64 requires the certified court reporter or court reporting firm to notify the parties to
65 the proceeding or their attorneys of: (1) the request; and (2) the name of the third-
66 party requester. If the request is for a transcript or video record media of the
67 testimony of an expert witness, unless a court order prohibits provision of the
-
*SB191*

– 3 –
68 transcript or record, section 4 requires the court reporter or court reporting firm to
69 provide the transcript or video record media to the third-party requester not later
70 than 60 days after providing notice of the request and upon receipt of a reasonable
71 fee prescribed by the court reporter or firm. If the request is for a transcript or video
72 record media of the proceeding other than the testimony of an expert witness,
73 section 4 authorizes any party to the proceeding to object to the provision of the
74 transcript or video record media by providing written notice to the court reporter or
75 court reporting firm, the parties to the proceeding or their attorneys and the third-
76 party requester. If a party so objects, section 4 prohibits the court reporter or court
77 reporting firm providing the requested transcript or video record media unless: (1) a
78 court order authorizes provision of the transcript or video record media; and (2) the
79 third-party requester pays a reasonable fee prescribed by the court reporter or firm.
80 Existing law requires an applicant for a certificate of registration as a certified
81 court reporter to take an examination administered by the Board. (NRS 656.160)
82 Sections 7 and 8: (1) require an applicant for a certificate of registration as a legal
83 video recorder to pass an examination administered by the Board and pay certain
84 fees; and (2) establish certain requirements relating to such an examination. Section
85 9 revises the requirements for a person to be admitted to take an examination.
86 Section 10 sets forth the circumstances under which an applicant is entitled to a
87 certificate of registration as a legal video recorder.
88 Section 12 sets forth circumstances under which the Board is authorized to
89 refuse to issue, suspend or revoke a certificate of registration as a legal video
90 recorder.
91 Sections 14 and 15 set forth certain requirements and restrictions relating to
92 the retention and alteration of video record media by a person who holds a
93 certificate as a legal video recorder.
94 Existing law sets forth the compensation that must be paid for various services
95 provided by the official reporter or reporter pro tempore in a state district court.
96 (NRS 3.370) Section 16 of this bill increases the compensation that must be paid to
97 such court reporters for certain transcription and reporting services.
98 Section 17 of this bill authorizes a person or business who, on or before
99 December 31, 2025, is engaged in the video recording of certain proceedings by the
100 use of video cameras or any system of recording simultaneous audio and video or is
101 providing certain referral services relating to such video recording without
102 obtaining a certificate of registration or license, as applicable to continue to engage
103 in such activities until July 1, 2026, or such other date as the Board may prescribe
104 by regulation.
