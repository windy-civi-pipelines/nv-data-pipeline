Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth the Nevada Certified Court Reporters’ and Licensed
2 Court Reporting Firms’ Law, which provides for the certification and regulation of
3 certified court reporters and the licensure and regulation of court reporting firms by
4 the Certified Court Reporters’ Board of Nevada. (Chapter 656 of NRS) Existing
5 law prohibits a person from engaging in the practice of court reporting without a
-
*SB191_R1*
– 2 –
6 valid certificate of registration as a certified court reporter. (NRS 656.145, 656.300)
7 Sections 3.5, 4.7-10 and 11.5-15 of this bill provide for the certification and
8 regulation by the Board of persons engaged in the “practice of legal recording,”
9 which section 5 defines to mean, in general, the recording of certain proceedings by
10 the use of audio equipment, video cameras or any system of recording simultaneous
11 audio and video. Section 5 designates a person certified by the Board to engage in
12 the practice of legal recording as a “certified legal recorder.” Section 3.5 requires
13 the Board to adopt regulations governing certified legal video recorders that
14 include, without limitation, the establishment of a provisional, basic and advanced
15 certificate as a legal recorder.
16 Existing law prohibits a person from conducting business as a court reporting
17 firm without a license issued by the Board. (NRS 656.185) Sections 3.5, 5.7, 11-
18 12.6, 14 and 15 of this bill provide for the licensure and regulation by the Board of
19 a “legal recording firm,” which section 5 defines to mean, in general, a business
20 entity that provides or arranges for certain services relating to certified legal
21 recorders.
22 Sections 11.7-12.1 set forth certain fees and certain circumstances under which
23 the Board is authorized to take certain disciplinary actions, including for engaging
24 in certain activities involving legal recording without a certificate or license.
25 Section 12.6 authorizes the Board to refer matters involving certain violations to a
26 district attorney or the Attorney General. Section 4.3 of this bill changes the name
27 of the Nevada Certified Court Reporters’ and Licensed Court Reporting Firms’
28 Law to the Nevada Court Reporting and Legal Recording Law. Section 4.7 sets
29 forth certain legislative declarations with respect to the certification and regulation
30 of certified legal recorders.
31 Existing law authorizes certain courts and magistrates to designate a person
32 who is not a certified court reporter to operate sound recording equipment to record
33 certain proceedings. (NRS 3.380, 4.400, 171.198) Section 16.3 of this bill similarly
34 authorizes a municipal court to make such a designation. Section 2 of this bill
35 exempts a person so designated from the provisions of the Nevada Court Reporting
36 and Legal Recording Law.
37 Section 5.3 of this bill replaces one member of the Board who is a certified
38 court reporter with a member who is a certified legal recorder, who is required to
39 have been actively engaged as a certified legal recorder for at least 5 years. Section
40 16.7 of this bill sets forth certain exceptions to those requirements for such a
41 member who is appointed before January 1, 2031. Section 13 authorizes a person
42 who holds a certificate of registration as a legal video recorder to use the title of
43 “certified legal recorder” and the abbreviation “C.L.R.” and prohibits any other
44 person from using that title or abbreviation in connection with his or her profession
45 or business.
46 Section 4 of this bill authorizes a person who is not a party to certain civil
47 proceedings to request a copy of a transcript or legal record media of the
48 proceeding from a court reporter, legal recorder, court reporting firm or legal
49 recording firm with possession of the transcript or legal record media. Upon receipt
50 of such a request, section 4 requires the court reporter, legal recorder or firm to
51 notify the parties to the proceeding or their attorneys of: (1) the request; and (2) the
52 name of the third-party requester. If the request is for a transcript or legal record
53 media of the testimony of an expert witness, unless a court order prohibits
54 provision of the transcript or record, section 4 requires the court reporter, legal
55 recorder or firm to provide the transcript or legal record media to the third-party
56 requester not later than 60 days after providing notice of the request and upon
57 receipt of a reasonable fee prescribed by the court reporter, legal recorder or firm. If
58 the request is for a transcript or legal record media of the proceeding other than the
59 testimony of an expert witness, section 4 authorizes any party to the proceeding to
60 object to the provision of the transcript or video record media by providing written
-
*SB191_R1*
– 3 –
61 notice to the court reporter, legal recorder or firm, the parties to the proceeding or
62 their attorneys and the third-party requester. If a party so objects, section 4
63 prohibits the court reporter, legal recorder or firm from providing the requested
64 transcript or legal record media unless: (1) a court order authorizes provision of the
65 transcript or legal record media; and (2) the third-party requester pays a reasonable
66 fee prescribed by the court reporter, legal recorder or firm.
67 Existing law requires an applicant for a certificate of registration as a certified
68 court reporter to take an examination administered by the Board. (NRS 656.160)
69 Sections 7 and 8: (1) require, with certain exceptions, an applicant for a certificate
70 of registration as a legal recorder to pass an examination administered by the Board
71 and pay certain fees; and (2) establish certain requirements relating to such an
72 examination. Section 9 revises the requirements for a person to be admitted to take
73 an examination. Section 10 sets forth the circumstances under which an applicant is
74 entitled to a certificate of registration as a legal recorder.
75 Section 12 sets forth circumstances under which the Board is authorized to
76 refuse to issue, suspend or revoke a certificate of registration as a legal recorder.
77 Sections 14 and 15 set forth certain requirements and restrictions relating to
78 the retention and alteration of legal record media by a person who holds a
79 certificate as a legal recorder.
80 Existing law sets forth the compensation that must be paid for various services
81 provided by the official reporter or reporter pro tempore in a state district court.
82 (NRS 3.370) Section 16 of this bill increases the compensation that must be paid to
83 such court reporters for certain transcription and reporting services.
84 Section 17 of this bill authorizes a person or business who, on or before
85 December 31, 2025, is engaged in the legal recording of certain proceedings by the
86 use of audio equipment, video cameras or any system of recording simultaneous
87 audio and video or is providing certain referral services relating to such recording
88 without obtaining a certificate of registration or license, as applicable, to continue
89 to engage in such activities until July 1, 2026, or such other date as the Board may
90 prescribe by regulation.

4 paid by the party to whom costs are awarded must be taxed as costs
5 in the case. The compensation for transcripts and copies ordered by
6 the parties must be paid by the party ordering them. No reporter may
7 be required to perform any service in a civil case until his or her
8 compensation has been paid to him or her.
9 6. Where a transcript is ordered by the court or by any party,
10 the compensation for the transcript must be paid to the reporter
11 before the furnishing of the transcript.

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth the Nevada Certified Court Reporters’ and Licensed
2 Court Reporting Firms’ Law, which provides for the certification and regulation of
3 certified court reporters and the licensure and regulation of court reporting firms by
4 the Certified Court Reporters’ Board of Nevada. (Chapter 656 of NRS) Existing
5 law prohibits a person from engaging in the practice of court reporting without a
-
*SB191_R1*

– 2 –
6 valid certificate of registration as a certified court reporter. (NRS 656.145, 656.300)
7 Sections 3.5, 4.7-10 and 11.5-15 of this bill provide for the certification and
8 regulation by the Board of persons engaged in the “practice of legal recording,”
9 which section 5 defines to mean, in general, the recording of certain proceedings by
10 the use of audio equipment, video cameras or any system of recording simultaneous
11 audio and video. Section 5 designates a person certified by the Board to engage in
12 the practice of legal recording as a “certified legal recorder.” Section 3.5 requires
13 the Board to adopt regulations governing certified legal video recorders that
14 include, without limitation, the establishment of a provisional, basic and advanced
15 certificate as a legal recorder.
16 Existing law prohibits a person from conducting business as a court reporting
17 firm without a license issued by the Board. (NRS 656.185) Sections 3.5, 5.7, 11-
18 12.6, 14 and 15 of this bill provide for the licensure and regulation by the Board of
19 a “legal recording firm,” which section 5 defines to mean, in general, a business
20 entity that provides or arranges for certain services relating to certified legal
21 recorders.
22 Sections 11.7-12.1 set forth certain fees and certain circumstances under which
23 the Board is authorized to take certain disciplinary actions, including for engaging
24 in certain activities involving legal recording without a certificate or license.
25 Section 12.6 authorizes the Board to refer matters involving certain violations to a
26 district attorney or the Attorney General. Section 4.3 of this bill changes the name
27 of the Nevada Certified Court Reporters’ and Licensed Court Reporting Firms’
28 Law to the Nevada Court Reporting and Legal Recording Law. Section 4.7 sets
29 forth certain legislative declarations with respect to the certification and regulation
30 of certified legal recorders.
31 Existing law authorizes certain courts and magistrates to designate a person
32 who is not a certified court reporter to operate sound recording equipment to record
33 certain proceedings. (NRS 3.380, 4.400, 171.198) Section 16.3 of this bill similarly
34 authorizes a municipal court to make such a designation. Section 2 of this bill
35 exempts a person so designated from the provisions of the Nevada Court Reporting
36 and Legal Recording Law.
37 Section 5.3 of this bill replaces one member of the Board who is a certified
38 court reporter with a member who is a certified legal recorder, who is required to
39 have been actively engaged as a certified legal recorder for at least 5 years. Section
40 16.7 of this bill sets forth certain exceptions to those requirements for such a
41 member who is appointed before January 1, 2031. Section 13 authorizes a person
42 who holds a certificate of registration as a legal video recorder to use the title of
43 “certified legal recorder” and the abbreviation “C.L.R.” and prohibits any other
44 person from using that title or abbreviation in connection with his or her profession
45 or business.
46 Section 4 of this bill authorizes a person who is not a party to certain civil
47 proceedings to request a copy of a transcript or legal record media of the
48 proceeding from a court reporter, legal recorder, court reporting firm or legal
49 recording firm with possession of the transcript or legal record media. Upon receipt
50 of such a request, section 4 requires the court reporter, legal recorder or firm to
51 notify the parties to the proceeding or their attorneys of: (1) the request; and (2) the
52 name of the third-party requester. If the request is for a transcript or legal record
53 media of the testimony of an expert witness, unless a court order prohibits
54 provision of the transcript or record, section 4 requires the court reporter, legal
55 recorder or firm to provide the transcript or legal record media to the third-party
56 requester not later than 60 days after providing notice of the request and upon
57 receipt of a reasonable fee prescribed by the court reporter, legal recorder or firm. If
58 the request is for a transcript or legal record media of the proceeding other than the
59 testimony of an expert witness, section 4 authorizes any party to the proceeding to
60 object to the provision of the transcript or video record media by providing written
-
*SB191_R1*

– 3 –
61 notice to the court reporter, legal recorder or firm, the parties to the proceeding or
62 their attorneys and the third-party requester. If a party so objects, section 4
63 prohibits the court reporter, legal recorder or firm from providing the requested
64 transcript or legal record media unless: (1) a court order authorizes provision of the
65 transcript or legal record media; and (2) the third-party requester pays a reasonable
66 fee prescribed by the court reporter, legal recorder or firm.
67 Existing law requires an applicant for a certificate of registration as a certified
68 court reporter to take an examination administered by the Board. (NRS 656.160)
69 Sections 7 and 8: (1) require, with certain exceptions, an applicant for a certificate
70 of registration as a legal recorder to pass an examination administered by the Board
71 and pay certain fees; and (2) establish certain requirements relating to such an
72 examination. Section 9 revises the requirements for a person to be admitted to take
73 an examination. Section 10 sets forth the circumstances under which an applicant is
74 entitled to a certificate of registration as a legal recorder.
75 Section 12 sets forth circumstances under which the Board is authorized to
76 refuse to issue, suspend or revoke a certificate of registration as a legal recorder.
77 Sections 14 and 15 set forth certain requirements and restrictions relating to
78 the retention and alteration of legal record media by a person who holds a
79 certificate as a legal recorder.
80 Existing law sets forth the compensation that must be paid for various services
81 provided by the official reporter or reporter pro tempore in a state district court.
82 (NRS 3.370) Section 16 of this bill increases the compensation that must be paid to
83 such court reporters for certain transcription and reporting services.
84 Section 17 of this bill authorizes a person or business who, on or before
85 December 31, 2025, is engaged in the legal recording of certain proceedings by the
86 use of audio equipment, video cameras or any system of recording simultaneous
87 audio and video or is providing certain referral services relating to such recording
88 without obtaining a certificate of registration or license, as applicable, to continue
89 to engage in such activities until July 1, 2026, or such other date as the Board may
90 prescribe by regulation.

35 must be fixed and allowed by the court and paid in the same
36 manner. The respective district judges may, with the approval of the
37 respective board or boards of county commissioners within the

2 parties in equal proportions, and either party may, at the party’s
3 option, pay the entire compensation. In either case, all amounts so
4 paid by the party to whom costs are awarded must be taxed as costs
5 in the case. The compensation for transcripts and copies ordered by
6 the parties must be paid by the party ordering them. No reporter may
7 be required to perform any service in a civil case until his or her
8 compensation has been paid to him or her.
9 6. Where a transcript is ordered by the court or by any party,
10 the compensation for the transcript must be paid to the reporter
11 before the furnishing of the transcript.
12 Sec. 16.3. NRS 5.015 is hereby amended to read as follows:
