Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth the Nevada Certified Court Reporters’ and Licensed Court
2 Reporting Firms’ Law, which provides for the certification and regulation of certified court
3 reporters and the licensure and regulation of court reporting firms by the Certified Court
4 Reporters’ Board of Nevada. (Chapter 656 of NRS) [Existing law prohibits a person from
5 engaging in the practice of court reporting without a valid certificate of registration as a
6 certified court reporter. (NRS 656.145, 656.300) Sections 3.5, 4.7-10 and 11.5-15 of this bill
7 provide for the certification and regulation by the Board of persons engaged in the “practice of
8 legal recording,” which section 5 defines to mean, in general, the recording of certain
9 proceedings by the use of audio equipment, video cameras or any system of recording
10 simultaneous audio and video. Section 5 designates a person certified by the Board to engage

Assembly Amendment No. 705 to Senate Bill No. 191 First Reprint Page 4
11 in the practice of legal recording as a “certified legal recorder.” Section 3.5 requires the Board
12 to adopt regulations governing certified legal video recorders that include, without limitation,
13 the establishment of a provisional, basic and advanced certificate as a legal recorder.
14 Existing law prohibits a person from conducting business as a court reporting firm
15 without a license issued by the Board. (NRS 656.185) Sections 3.5, 5.7, 11-12.6, 14 and 15 of
16 this bill provide for the licensure and regulation by the Board of a “legal recording firm,”
17 which section 5 defines to mean, in general, a business entity that provides or arranges for
18 certain services relating to certified legal recorders.
19 Sections 11.7 -12.1 set forth certain fees and certain circumstances under which the Board
20 is authorized to take certain disciplinary actions, including for engaging in certain activities
21 involving legal recording without a certificate or license. Section 12.6 authorizes the Board to
22 refer matters involving certain violations to a district attorney or the Attorney General. Section
23 4.3 of this bill changes the name of the Nevada Certified Court Reporters’ and Licensed Court
24 Reporting Firms’ Law to the Nevada Court Reporting and Legal Recording Law. Section 4.7
25 sets forth certain legislative declarations with respect to the certification and regulation of
26 certified legal recorders.]
27 Existing law sets forth certain fees applicable to certified court reporters and court
28 reporting firms. (NRS 656.220) Section 11.7 of this bill removes the amounts for such
29 fees and instead requires the Board to prescribe by regulation initial reasonable fees for
30 certified court reporters and court reporting firms. Section 11.7 requires those fees to be
31 equal to the fees set forth in existing law as of December 31, 2025. Section 11.7
32 authorizes the Board, after prescribing such initial fees, to increase or decrease a fee by
33 regulation to an amount that is not less than 90 percent and not more than 125 percent
34 of the current fee. Section 17.5 of this bill provides that the existing fees remain in effect
35 until the Board has established such fees by regulation. Sections 7 and 9 of this bill make
36 conforming changes to reflect the requirement imposed in section 11.7 that the Board
37 prescribe fees for certified court reporters by regulation.
38 Existing law authorizes certain courts and magistrates to designate a person who is not
39 required to be a certified court reporter to operate sound recording equipment to record
40 certain proceedings. (NRS 3.380, 4.400, 171.198) Section 16.3 of this bill similarly authorizes
41 a municipal court to make such a designation. [Section 2 of this bill exempts a person so
42 designated from the provisions of the Nevada Court Reporting and Legal Recording Law.
43 Section 5.3 of this bill replaces one member of the Board who is a certified court reporter
44 with a member who is a certified legal recorder, who is required to have been actively
45 engaged as a certified legal recorder for at least 5 years. Section 16.7 of this bill sets forth
46 certain exceptions to those requirements for such a member who is appointed before January
47 1, 2031. Section 13 authorizes a person who holds a certificate of registration as a legal video
48 recorder to use the title of “certified legal recorder” and the abbreviation “C.L.R.” and
49 prohibits any other person from using that title or abbreviation in connection with his or her
50 profession or business.
51 Section 4 of this bill authorizes a person who is not a party to certain civil proceedings to
52 request a copy of a transcript or legal record media of the proceeding from a court reporter,
53 legal recorder, court reporting firm or legal recording firm with possession of the transcript or
54 legal record media. Upon receipt of such a request, section 4 requires the court reporter, legal
55 recorder or firm to notify the parties to the proceeding or their attorneys of: (1) the request;
56 and (2) the name of the third-party requester. If the request is for a transcript or legal record
57 media of the testimony of an expert witness, unless a court order prohibits provision of the
58 transcript or record, section 4 requires the court reporter, legal recorder or firm to provide the
59 transcript or legal record media to the third-party requester not later than 60 days after
60 providing notice of the request and upon receipt of a reasonable fee prescribed by the court
61 reporter, legal recorder or firm. If the request is for a transcript or legal record media of the
62 proceeding other than the testimony of an expert witness, section 4 authorizes any party to the
63 proceeding to object to the provision of the transcript or video record media by providing
64 written notice to the court reporter, legal recorder or firm, the parties to the proceeding or their
65 attorneys and the third-party requester. If a party so objects, section 4 prohibits the court
66 reporter, legal recorder or firm from providing the requested transcript or legal record media
67 unless: (1) a court order authorizes provision of the transcript or legal record media; and (2)
68 the third-party requester pays a reasonable fee prescribed by the court reporter, legal recorder
69 or firm.

Assembly Amendment No. 705 to Senate Bill No. 191 First Reprint Page 5
70 Existing law requires an applicant for a certificate of registration as a certified court
71 reporter to take an examination administered by the Board. (NRS 656.160) Sections 7 and 8:
72 (1) require, with certain exceptions, an applicant for a certificate of registration as a legal
73 recorder to pass an examination administered by the Board and pay certain fees; and (2)
74 establish certain requirements relating to such an examination. Section 9 revises the
75 requirements for a person to be admitted to take an examination. Section 10 sets forth the
76 circumstances under which an applicant is entitled to a certificate of registration as a legal
77 recorder.
78 Section 12 sets forth circumstances under which the Board is authorized to refuse to
79 issue, suspend or revoke a certificate of registration as a legal recorder.
80 Sections 14 and 15 set forth certain requirements and restrictions relating to the retention
81 and alteration of legal record media by a person who holds a certificate as a legal recorder.]
82 Existing law sets forth the compensation that must be paid for various services provided
83 by the official reporter or reporter pro tempore in a state district court. (NRS 3.370) Section
84 16 of this bill increases the compensation that must be paid to such court reporters for certain
85 transcription and reporting services.
86 [Section 17 of this bill authorizes a person or business who, on or before December 31,
87 2025, is engaged in the legal recording of certain proceedings by the use of audio equipment,
88 video cameras or any system of recording simultaneous audio and video or is providing
89 certain referral services relating to such recording without obtaining a certificate of
90 registration or license, as applicable, to continue to engage in such activities until July 1,
91 2026, or such other date as the Board may prescribe by regulation.]
