AN ACT relating to professions; requiring the Certified Court
Reporters’ Board of Nevada to prescribe by regulation
certain fees; authorizing a municipal court to designate a
person who is not required to be a certified court reporter
to operate certain sound recording equipment; increasing
the compensation for certain services provided by a court
reporter in district court; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth the Nevada Certified Court Reporters’ and Licensed
2 Court Reporting Firms’ Law, which provides for the certification and regulation of
3 certified court reporters and the licensure and regulation of court reporting firms by
4 the Certified Court Reporters’ Board of Nevada. (Chapter 656 of NRS)
5 Existing law sets forth certain fees applicable to certified court reporters and
6 court reporting firms. (NRS 656.220) Section 11.7 of this bill removes the amounts
7 for such fees and instead requires the Board to prescribe by regulation initial
8 reasonable fees for certified court reporters and court reporting firms. Section 11.7
9 requires those fees to be equal to the fees set forth in existing law as of
10 December 31, 2025. Section 11.7 authorizes the Board, after prescribing such
11 initial fees, to increase or decrease a fee by regulation to an amount that is not less
12 than 90 percent and not more than 125 percent of the current fee. Section 17.5 of
13 this bill provides that the existing fees remain in effect until the Board has
14 established such fees by regulation. Sections 7 and 9 of this bill make conforming
15 changes to reflect the requirement imposed in section 11.7 that the Board prescribe
16 fees for certified court reporters by regulation.

17 Existing law authorizes certain courts and magistrates to designate a person
18 who is not required to be a certified court reporter to operate sound recording
19 equipment to record certain proceedings. (NRS 3.380, 4.400, 171.198) Section 16.3
20 of this bill similarly authorizes a municipal court to make such a designation.
21 Existing law sets forth the compensation that must be paid for various services
22 provided by the official reporter or reporter pro tempore in a state district court.
23 (NRS 3.370) Section 16 of this bill increases the compensation that must be paid to
24 such court reporters for certain transcription and reporting services.

~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to professions; requiring the Certified Court
Reporters’ Board of Nevada to prescribe by regulation
certain fees; authorizing a municipal court to designate a
person who is not required to be a certified court reporter
to operate certain sound recording equipment; increasing
the compensation for certain services provided by a court
reporter in district court; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth the Nevada Certified Court Reporters’ and Licensed
2 Court Reporting Firms’ Law, which provides for the certification and regulation of
3 certified court reporters and the licensure and regulation of court reporting firms by
4 the Certified Court Reporters’ Board of Nevada. (Chapter 656 of NRS)
5 Existing law sets forth certain fees applicable to certified court reporters and
6 court reporting firms. (NRS 656.220) Section 11.7 of this bill removes the amounts
7 for such fees and instead requires the Board to prescribe by regulation initial
8 reasonable fees for certified court reporters and court reporting firms. Section 11.7
9 requires those fees to be equal to the fees set forth in existing law as of
10 December 31, 2025. Section 11.7 authorizes the Board, after prescribing such
11 initial fees, to increase or decrease a fee by regulation to an amount that is not less
12 than 90 percent and not more than 125 percent of the current fee. Section 17.5 of
13 this bill provides that the existing fees remain in effect until the Board has
14 established such fees by regulation. Sections 7 and 9 of this bill make conforming
15 changes to reflect the requirement imposed in section 11.7 that the Board prescribe
16 fees for certified court reporters by regulation.

17 Existing law authorizes certain courts and magistrates to designate a person
18 who is not required to be a certified court reporter to operate sound recording
19 equipment to record certain proceedings. (NRS 3.380, 4.400, 171.198) Section 16.3
20 of this bill similarly authorizes a municipal court to make such a designation.
21 Existing law sets forth the compensation that must be paid for various services
22 provided by the official reporter or reporter pro tempore in a state district court.
23 (NRS 3.370) Section 16 of this bill increases the compensation that must be paid to
24 such court reporters for certain transcription and reporting services.
