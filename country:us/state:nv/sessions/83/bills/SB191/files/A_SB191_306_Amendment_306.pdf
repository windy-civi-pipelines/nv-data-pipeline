AN ACT relating to professions; exempting certain persons from provisions of
existing law governing certified court reporters and court reporting
firms; providing for [revising provisions governing] the certification ,
[and] licensing and regulation of certified [court reporters and court
reporting firms to include] legal [video] recorders [;] and legal
recording firms by the Certified Court Reporters’ Board of
Nevada; requiring court reporters [and] , legal recorders, court

transcripts and recordings to third-party requesters under certain
circumstances; defining certain terms and revising certain terms
relating to certified court reporters [and] , certified legal recorders,

membership of the Board; authorizing the Board to refer certain
violations to a district attorney or the Attorney General; increasing

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth the Nevada Certified Court Reporters’ and Licensed Court
2 Reporting Firms’ Law, which provides for the certification and regulation of certified court
3 reporters and the licensure and regulation of court reporting firms by the Certified Court
4 Reporters’ Board of Nevada. (Chapter 656 of NRS) Existing law prohibits a person from
5 engaging in the practice of court reporting without a valid certificate of registration as a
6 certified court reporter. (NRS 656.145, 656.300) Sections [3, 5-10] 3.5, 4.7-10 and [12-15]
7 11.5-15 of this bill provide for the certification and regulation by the Board of persons
8 engaged in the “practice of legal recording,” which section 5 defines to mean, in general,
9 the recording of certain proceedings by the use of audio equipment, video cameras or any
10 system of recording simultaneous audio and video. Section 5 [expands] designates a person
11 certified by the Board to engage in the [definitions of: (1) “certificate” to mean a certificate

Senate Amendment No. 306 to Senate Bill No. 191 Page 4
12 of registration as a court reporter or a certificate] practice of [registration as a] legal [video
13 recorder; (2) “certified court reporter” to mean a person who holds a certificate of registration]
14 recording as a [court reporter or a certificate as a] “certified legal [video] recorder.” [; and
15 (3) “practice of court reporting” to include video recording in this State certain proceedings,
16 by the use of video cameras or any system of recording simultaneous audio and video. As
17 such, under section 5, a person who engages in the video recording of certain proceedings by
18 the use of video cameras or any system of recording simultaneous audio and video is engaged
19 in the practice of court reporting and is prohibited from doing so without a certificate of
20 registration as a legal video recorder issued by the Board. If such a person obtains such a
21 certificate, under section 5, the person would constitute a certified court reporter.] Section 3.5
22 requires the Board to adopt regulations governing certified legal video recorders that
23 include, without limitation, the establishment of a provisional, basic and advanced
24 certificate as a legal recorder.
25 Existing law prohibits a person from conducting business as a court reporting firm
26 without a license issued by the Board. (NRS 656.185) [Existing law defines “court reporting
27 firm” to mean, in general, a business that provides or arranges for the services of a certified
28 court reporter or provides referral services for certified court reporters. (NRS 656.030)
29 Because a person who engages in the video recording of certain proceedings and has obtained
30 a certificate or registration as a legal video recorder constitutes a certified court reporter,
31 under section 5, a person is prohibited from providing or arranging services for such video
32 recording or providing referral services for a person who engages in such video recording.
33 Sections 6 and 11 of this bill revise provisions relating to engaging in the practice of court
34 reporting or conducting business as a court reporting firm without a certificate of registration
35 or license issued by the Board, as applicable, to reflect the changes in section 5, which provide
36 that a certified court reporter includes a person who has obtained a certificate of registration as
37 a court reporter or a certificate of registration as a legal video recorder.] Sections 3.5, 5.7, 11-
38 12.6, 14 and 15 of this bill provide for the licensure and regulation by the Board of a
39 “legal recording firm,” which section 5 defines to mean, in general, a business entity that
40 provides or arranges for certain services relating to certified legal recorders.
41 Sections 11.7-12.1 set forth certain fees and certain circumstances under which the
42 Board is authorized to take certain disciplinary actions, including for engaging in certain
43 activities involving legal recording without a certificate or license. Section 12.6
44 authorizes the Board to refer matters involving certain violations to a district attorney
45 or the Attorney General. Section 4.3 of this bill changes the name of the Nevada
46 Certified Court Reporters’ and Licensed Court Reporting Firms’ Law to the Nevada
47 Court Reporting and Legal Recording Law. Section 4.7 sets forth certain legislative
48 declarations with respect to the certification and regulation of certified legal recorders.
49 Existing law authorizes certain courts and magistrates to designate a person who is not a
50 certified court reporter to operate sound recording equipment to record certain proceedings.
51 (NRS 3.380, 4.400, 171.198) Section 16.3 of this bill similarly authorizes a municipal
52 court to make such a designation. Section 2 of this bill exempts [such] a person so
53 designated from the provisions of the Nevada [Certified] Court [Reporters’] Reporting and
54 [Licensed Court Reporting Firms’] Legal Recording Law.
55 [Section 3 prohibits a person who holds a certificate of registration as a legal video
56 recorder from recording certain proceedings unless another person who holds a certificate of
57 registration as a court reporter is present. Section 3 also prohibits a person who holds only a
58 certificate of registration: (1) as a legal video recorder from engaging in the practices of a
59 person who holds a certificate of registration as a court reporter; and (2) as a court reporter
60 from engaging in the practices of a person who holds a certificate of registration as a legal
61 video recorder. Finally, section 3 prohibits a person who holds both a certificate of registration
62 as a court reporter and a certificate of registration as a legal video recorder from performing
63 both functions simultaneously during the same proceeding.] Section 5.3 of this bill replaces
64 one member of the Board who is a certified court reporter with a member who is a
65 certified legal recorder, who is required to have been actively engaged as a certified legal
66 recorder for at least 5 years. Section 16.7 of this bill sets forth certain exceptions to those
67 requirements for such a member who is appointed before January 1, 2031. Section 13 [:
68 (1)] authorizes a person who holds a certificate of registration as a legal video recorder to use
69 the title of “certified [court reporter- legal video] legal recorder” and the abbreviation
70 [“C.C.R.-L.V.R.”;(2)] “C.L.R.” and prohibits [a] any other person [who holds a certificate

Senate Amendment No. 306 to Senate Bill No. 191 Page 5
71 as a legal video recorder] from using [any other] that title or abbreviation [applicable to a
72 person who holds a certificate of registration as a court reporter, unless the person also holds
73 another applicable certificate; and (3) prohibits any other person from using the title or
74 abbreviation of a legal video reporter] in connection with his or her profession or business . [,
75 unless the person holds such a certificate of registration.]
76 Section 4 of this bill authorizes a person who is not a party to certain civil proceedings to
77 request a copy of a transcript or [video] legal record media of the proceeding from a
78 [certified] court reporter [or] , legal recorder, court reporting firm or legal recording firm
79 with possession of the transcript or [video] legal record media. Upon receipt of such a request,
80 section 4 requires the [certified] court reporter , legal recorder or [court reporting] firm to
81 notify the parties to the proceeding or their attorneys of: (1) the request; and (2) the name of
82 the third-party requester. If the request is for a transcript or [video] legal record media of the
83 testimony of an expert witness, unless a court order prohibits provision of the transcript or
84 record, section 4 requires the court reporter , legal recorder or [court reporting] firm to
85 provide the transcript or [video] legal record media to the third-party requester not later than
86 60 days after providing notice of the request and upon receipt of a reasonable fee prescribed
87 by the court reporter , legal recorder or firm. If the request is for a transcript or [video] legal
88 record media of the proceeding other than the testimony of an expert witness, section 4
89 authorizes any party to the proceeding to object to the provision of the transcript or video
90 record media by providing written notice to the court reporter , legal recorder or [court
91 reporting] firm, the parties to the proceeding or their attorneys and the third-party requester. If
92 a party so objects, section 4 prohibits the court reporter , legal recorder or [court reporting]
93 firm from providing the requested transcript or [video] legal record media unless: (1) a court
94 order authorizes provision of the transcript or [video] legal record media; and (2) the third-
95 party requester pays a reasonable fee prescribed by the court reporter , legal recorder or firm.
96 Existing law requires an applicant for a certificate of registration as a certified court
97 reporter to take an examination administered by the Board. (NRS 656.160) Sections 7 and 8:
98 (1) require , with certain exceptions, an applicant for a certificate of registration as a legal
99 [video] recorder to pass an examination administered by the Board and pay certain fees; and
100 (2) establish certain requirements relating to such an examination. Section 9 revises the
101 requirements for a person to be admitted to take an examination. Section 10 sets forth the
102 circumstances under which an applicant is entitled to a certificate of registration as a legal
103 [video] recorder.
104 Section 12 sets forth circumstances under which the Board is authorized to refuse to
105 issue, suspend or revoke a certificate of registration as a legal [video] recorder.
106 Sections 14 and 15 set forth certain requirements and restrictions relating to the retention
107 and alteration of [video] legal record media by a person who holds a certificate as a legal
108 [video] recorder.
109 Existing law sets forth the compensation that must be paid for various services provided
110 by the official reporter or reporter pro tempore in a state district court. (NRS 3.370) Section
111 16 of this bill increases the compensation that must be paid to such court reporters for certain
112 transcription and reporting services.
113 Section 17 of this bill authorizes a person or business who, on or before December 31,
114 2025, is engaged in the [video] legal recording of certain proceedings by the use of audio
115 equipment, video cameras or any system of recording simultaneous audio and video or is
116 providing certain referral services relating to such [video] recording without obtaining a
117 certificate of registration or license, as applicable , to continue to engage in such activities
118 until July 1, 2026, or such other date as the Board may prescribe by regulation.
