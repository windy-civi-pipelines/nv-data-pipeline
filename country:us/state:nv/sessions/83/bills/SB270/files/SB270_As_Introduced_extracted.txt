EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to governmental administration; requiring each
contractor and subcontractor on a public work or a project
paid for in whole or in part by public funds to produce
certain documents for inspection upon request from
certain entities; requiring a contractor or subcontractor to
provide the representative of a joint labor-management
committee reasonable access to a public work to monitor
compliance with requirements relating to the use of
apprenticeships and the payment of prevailing wages; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the payment of prevailing wages to certain workers on a
2 public work. (NRS 338.020) Existing law makes the prevailing wage requirements
3 applicable to certain other construction projects that do not meet the definition of a
4 “public work.” (See, e.g. NRS 244.286, 244A.058, 244A.763, 268.568, 271.710,
5 271.800, 278C.240, 279.500, 318.140, 318.144, 321.416, 332.390, 333A.120,
6 349.670, 349.956, 349.981, 388A.635, 408.3886, 543.545, 701B.265, 701B.625)
7 Section 2 of this bill requires a contractor or subcontractor on a public work or
8 other project paid for in whole or in part from public funds to provide certain
9 documents upon the written request of a Taft-Hartley trust fund or a joint labor-
10 management committee. The documents that may be inspected upon request, as
11 they relate to the public work, are: (1) the bid on the contract and any documents
12 submitted as part of the bidding process; (2) any executed contract or subcontract;
13 and (3) any record of work performed, including, without limitation, payroll
14 records. Section 2 provides that: (1) the requested documents must be produced
15 within 10 days after receipt of a written request; and (2) personal identifying
16 information must be redacted from any requested document. Section 2 further
17 provides that: (1) if a document requested is not provided within 10 days after
18 receipt of a written request, the requesting party may file a complaint with the
-

– 2 –
19 Labor Commissioner; (2) upon review of such a complaint, the Labor
20 Commissioner may impose an administrative penalty against the noncompliant
21 party in the amount of $100 for each day the document is not produced; and (3) a
22 contractor will not be penalized for failing to produce any requested document that
23 is in the possession or control of a subcontractor. For the purposes of section 2, it
24 shall be deemed that a project is a project paid for in whole or in part by public
25 money if: (1) a public body pays money or other compensation directly to or on
26 behalf of the developer or contractor of the project or any subcontractor who
27 performs any work on the project; (2) a public body pays, credits, reduces, forgives
28 or waives any fee, cost, rent, insurance premium, bond premium, obligation or
29 expense in relation to the project that is normally required in the execution of a
30 contract for a public work; (3) a public body loans money in relation to the project
31 that is required to be repaid to the public body on a contingent basis; or (4) in
32 relation to the project, a public body transfers the project for less than fair market
33 value.
34 Section 3 of this bill provides that a representative of a joint labor-management
35 committee must be given reasonable access to a public work to monitor compliance
36 with prevailing wage and certain apprenticeships requirements. Section 3 exempts
37 a public body, contractor or subcontractor on a public work from liability for any
38 injury sustained by, or violation of any standard for occupational safety and health
39 as a result of monitoring by, a representative of a joint labor-management
40 committee. Section 3 further authorizes a joint labor-management committee to
41 bring a cause of action in a court of competent jurisdiction against a public body,
42 contractor or subcontractor who denies reasonable access to a public work and, if
43 the joint labor-management committee prevails, to be awarded: (1) $1,000 for each
44 occasion reasonable access was denied; and (2) reasonable attorney’s fees and
45 costs. Section 3 defines “reasonable access” as access during reasonable working
46 hours that does not disrupt the performance of any work and does not violate any
47 occupational safety and health standards.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

2 thereto the provisions set forth as sections 2 and 3 of this act.

24 subcontractor who performs any work on the project;

29 (c) A public body loans money in relation to the project that is
