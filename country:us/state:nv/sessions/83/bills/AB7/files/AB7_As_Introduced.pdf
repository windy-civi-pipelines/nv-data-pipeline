AN ACT relating to juvenile justice; revising the term length and

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 The federal Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 provides
2 federal funding to states to develop programs in the area of juvenile delinquency
3 and to improve the juvenile justice system. To be eligible for certain federal grants
4 under the Act, a state must submit to the Administrator of the Office of Juvenile
5 Justice and Delinquency Prevention within the United States Department of Justice
6 a plan that provides for an advisory group which consists of certain members
7 appointed by the chief executive officer of the state. (34 U.S.C. § 11133) To
8 comply with this eligibility requirement, existing state law establishes the Juvenile
9 Justice Oversight Commission and prescribes specific qualifications for
10 membership on the Commission. (NRS 62B.600) Section 1 of this bill replaces
11 certain requirements concerning the number of members of the Commission and
12 the qualifications for membership on the Commission with a requirement that the
13 membership of the Commission must comply with the requirements of the Act.
14 Section 1 also increases the term of members of the Commission from 2 years to 4
15 years. Section 2 of this bill: (1) provides that the term of each existing member of
16 the Commission expires on October 1, 2025; and (2) requires the Governor to
17 appoint new members to the Commission.
