EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to constructional defects; requiring a written
response to a notice of a constructional defect to include
certain information; requiring a contractor, subcontractor
and certain related professionals to maintain a policy of
insurance which covers liability for constructional
defects; revising provisions relating to certain settlement
offers concerning constructional defects; clarifying
certain provisions relating to the recovery of damages
proximately caused by a constructional defect; revising
provisions relating to certain required mediation; revising
the definitions of certain terms related to actions resulting
from constructional defects; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes an owner of a residence or appurtenance and certain
2 other persons to commence a civil action against a contractor, subcontractor,
3 supplier or design professional for certain constructional defects in the residence or
4 appurtenance. (NRS 40.610, 40.640, 40.645) Under existing law, before a claimant
5 commences an action or amends a complaint to add a cause of action for a
6 constructional defect, the claimant must give written notice to the contractor and
7 the matter must be submitted to mediation unless mediation is waived in writing.
8 (NRS 40.645) Existing law also requires a contractor, subcontractor, supplier or
9 design professional who receives notice of a constructional defect to send a written
10 response to the claimant within 90 days after receiving the notice. (NRS 40.6472)
11 Section 3 of this bill: (1) requires the written response to state whether the
12 contractor, subcontractor, supplier or design professional has elected to enter into
13 mediation or waive mediation in writing; and (2) provides that failure to include
14 such a statement shall be deemed a written waiver of the requirement to submit the
-
*AB505*
– 2 –
15 matter to mediation. Section 3 also requires the written response to include certain
16 additional information if the contractor, subcontractor, supplier or design
17 professional has elected to repair the constructional defect. Section 8 of this bill
18 revises provisions governing the mediation required by existing law by: (1)
19 providing that such mediation must be waived in writing on or before the deadline
20 for the submission of the written response required by section 3; and (2) removing
21 language prohibiting the total fees for each day of mediation from exceeding $750.
22 Existing law authorizes, but does not require, a contractor, subcontractor,
23 supplier or design professional who receives written notice of a constructional
24 defect to present the claim to an insurer. (NRS 40.649) Section 4 of this bill
25 requires a contractor, subcontractor, supplier and design professional to: (1)
26 maintain a policy of insurance which covers liability for constructional defects; and
27 (2) present the claim to the insurer that issued the policy.
28 Existing law establishes a procedure by which a claimant and a contractor,
29 subcontractor, supplier or design professional may agree to have a judgment
30 entered before the claimant commences a civil action for the constructional defect
31 or amends a complaint to add a cause of action for the constructional defect. (NRS
32 40.652) Sections 5 and 10 of this bill revise this procedure and eliminate certain
33 penalties for the rejection of a settlement offer for consistency with Rule 68 of the
34 Nevada Rules of Civil Procedure and certain other provisions of existing law
35 relating to settlement offers. Sections 6 and 7 of this bill make conforming changes
36 by removing references to the provision repealed by section 10 and certain related
37 language. Section 6 also clarifies that any interest recoverable as damages in a
38 cause of action for a constructional defect must be provided by statute for damages
39 otherwise recoverable by the claimant. (NRS 40.655)
40 Sections 1 and 2 of this bill revise the definitions of certain terms applicable to
41 actions resulting from constructional defects.

4 Sec. 5. NRS 40.652 is hereby amended to read as follows:
5 40.652 1. At any time after a claimant has given notice

6 judgment.
7 (3) Reasonable attorney’s fees incurred by the party who
8 made the offer for the period from the date of service of the offer to
9 the date of entry of the judgment. If the attorney of the party who
10 made the offer is collecting a contingent fee, the amount of any
11 attorney’s fees awarded to the party pursuant to this subparagraph
12 must be deducted from that contingent fee.
13 5. To determine whether a party who rejected an offer of
14 judgment failed to obtain a more favorable judgment:

16 court must compare the amount of the offer with the principal
17 amount of the judgment, without inclusion of costs.

19 must compare the amount of the offer with the sum of:

30 the party who made the offer a separate written notice of acceptance
31 of the offer. If any party rejects the apportioned offer:

33 apportioned offer was made, whether or not the other parties
34 accepted or rejected the offer; and

40 (a) An offer of judgment made to multiple parties who received
41 a notice pursuant to NRS 40.645 or 40.646 unless the same person is
42 authorized to decide whether to settle the claims against all the
43 parties to whom the offer is made and:
44 (1) There is a single common theory of liability against all
45 the parties to whom the offer is made;

25 the reasonable expenses of temporary housing reasonably necessary
26 during the repair;
27 (b) The reduction in market value of the residence or accessory
28 structure, if any, to the extent the reduction is because of structural

A.B. 505
ASSEMBLY BILL NO. 505–COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY
MARCH 24, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Commerce and Labor
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to constructional defects.
(BDR 3-1144)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to constructional defects; requiring a written
response to a notice of a constructional defect to include
certain information; requiring a contractor, subcontractor
and certain related professionals to maintain a policy of
insurance which covers liability for constructional
defects; revising provisions relating to certain settlement
offers concerning constructional defects; clarifying
certain provisions relating to the recovery of damages
proximately caused by a constructional defect; revising
provisions relating to certain required mediation; revising
the definitions of certain terms related to actions resulting
from constructional defects; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes an owner of a residence or appurtenance and certain
2 other persons to commence a civil action against a contractor, subcontractor,
3 supplier or design professional for certain constructional defects in the residence or
4 appurtenance. (NRS 40.610, 40.640, 40.645) Under existing law, before a claimant
5 commences an action or amends a complaint to add a cause of action for a
6 constructional defect, the claimant must give written notice to the contractor and
7 the matter must be submitted to mediation unless mediation is waived in writing.
8 (NRS 40.645) Existing law also requires a contractor, subcontractor, supplier or
9 design professional who receives notice of a constructional defect to send a written
10 response to the claimant within 90 days after receiving the notice. (NRS 40.6472)
11 Section 3 of this bill: (1) requires the written response to state whether the
12 contractor, subcontractor, supplier or design professional has elected to enter into
13 mediation or waive mediation in writing; and (2) provides that failure to include
14 such a statement shall be deemed a written waiver of the requirement to submit the
-
*AB505*

– 2 –
15 matter to mediation. Section 3 also requires the written response to include certain
16 additional information if the contractor, subcontractor, supplier or design
17 professional has elected to repair the constructional defect. Section 8 of this bill
18 revises provisions governing the mediation required by existing law by: (1)
19 providing that such mediation must be waived in writing on or before the deadline
20 for the submission of the written response required by section 3; and (2) removing
21 language prohibiting the total fees for each day of mediation from exceeding $750.
22 Existing law authorizes, but does not require, a contractor, subcontractor,
23 supplier or design professional who receives written notice of a constructional
24 defect to present the claim to an insurer. (NRS 40.649) Section 4 of this bill
25 requires a contractor, subcontractor, supplier and design professional to: (1)
26 maintain a policy of insurance which covers liability for constructional defects; and
27 (2) present the claim to the insurer that issued the policy.
28 Existing law establishes a procedure by which a claimant and a contractor,
29 subcontractor, supplier or design professional may agree to have a judgment
30 entered before the claimant commences a civil action for the constructional defect
31 or amends a complaint to add a cause of action for the constructional defect. (NRS
32 40.652) Sections 5 and 10 of this bill revise this procedure and eliminate certain
33 penalties for the rejection of a settlement offer for consistency with Rule 68 of the
34 Nevada Rules of Civil Procedure and certain other provisions of existing law
35 relating to settlement offers. Sections 6 and 7 of this bill make conforming changes
36 by removing references to the provision repealed by section 10 and certain related
37 language. Section 6 also clarifies that any interest recoverable as damages in a
38 cause of action for a constructional defect must be provided by statute for damages
39 otherwise recoverable by the claimant. (NRS 40.655)
40 Sections 1 and 2 of this bill revise the definitions of certain terms applicable to
41 actions resulting from constructional defects.

29 (2) Enter into mediation or waive mediation in writing
30 pursuant to NRS 40.680. Failure to include the statement required

*AB505*

– 5 –

2 not relieve the insurer of any duty under the policy of insurance to
3 the contractor, subcontractor, supplier or design professional.]
4 Sec. 5. NRS 40.652 is hereby amended to read as follows:
5 40.652 1. At any time after a claimant has given notice
6 pursuant to NRS 40.645 and before the claimant commences an
7 action or amends a complaint to add a cause of action for a

12 written offer to allow judgment to be entered without action in
13 accordance with the terms and conditions of the offer of judgment.
14 Except as otherwise provided in subsection 7, any such written
15 offer must be unconditional and for a set amount.
16 2. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 7, if, within [10]
17 14 days after the date of service of an offer of judgment, the party to

20 the offer may file the offer, the notice of acceptance and proof of
21 service with the clerk of the district court. Upon receipt by the clerk,
22 the clerk shall enter a judgment according to the terms of the offer.
23 Any judgment entered pursuant to this section shall be deemed a
24 compromise settlement. The judgment, the offer, the notice of
25 acceptance and proof of service, with the judgment endorsed,
26 become the judgment roll.
27 3. If the offer of judgment is not accepted pursuant to
28 subsection 2 within [10] 14 days after the date of service, the offer
29 shall be deemed rejected by the party to whom it was made and
30 withdrawn by the party who made it. The rejection of an offer does
31 not preclude any party from making another offer pursuant to this
32 section. Evidence of a rejected offer is not admissible in any
33 proceeding other than a proceeding to determine costs and fees.
34 4. Except as otherwise provided in this section, if a party who
35 rejects an offer of judgment fails to obtain a more favorable
36 judgment in an action for a constructional defect, the court:
37 (a) May not award to the party any costs or attorney’s fees;
38 (b) May not award to the party any interest on the judgment for

41 (c) Shall order the party to pay the taxable costs incurred by the
42 party who made the offer; and
43 (d) May order the party to pay to the party who made the offer

*AB505*

– 6 –

2 who made the offer for each expert witness whose services were
3 reasonably necessary to prepare for and conduct the trial of the case.
4 (2) Any applicable interest on the judgment for the period
5 from the date of service of the offer to the date of entry of the
6 judgment.
7 (3) Reasonable attorney’s fees incurred by the party who
8 made the offer for the period from the date of service of the offer to
9 the date of entry of the judgment. If the attorney of the party who
10 made the offer is collecting a contingent fee, the amount of any
11 attorney’s fees awarded to the party pursuant to this subparagraph
12 must be deducted from that contingent fee.
13 5. To determine whether a party who rejected an offer of
14 judgment failed to obtain a more favorable judgment:
15 (a) If the offer provided that the court would award costs, the
16 court must compare the amount of the offer with the principal
17 amount of the judgment, without inclusion of costs.
18 (b) If the offer precluded a separate award of costs, the court
19 must compare the amount of the offer with the sum of:
20 (1) The principal amount of the judgment; and
21 (2) The amount of taxable costs that the claimant who
22 obtained the judgment incurred before the date of service of the
23 offer.
24 6. Multiple parties may make a joint offer of judgment
25 pursuant to this section.
26 7. A party may make to two or more other parties pursuant to
27 this section an apportioned offer of judgment that is conditioned
28 upon acceptance by all the parties to whom the apportioned offer is
29 made. Each party to whom such an offer is made may serve upon
30 the party who made the offer a separate written notice of acceptance
31 of the offer. If any party rejects the apportioned offer:
32 (a) The action must proceed as to all parties to whom the
33 apportioned offer was made, whether or not the other parties
34 accepted or rejected the offer; and
35 (b) The sanctions set forth in subsection 4:
36 (1) Apply to each party who rejected the apportioned offer.
37 (2) Do not apply to any party who accepted the apportioned
38 offer.
39 8. The sanctions set forth in subsection 4 do not apply to:
40 (a) An offer of judgment made to multiple parties who received
41 a notice pursuant to NRS 40.645 or 40.646 unless the same person is
42 authorized to decide whether to settle the claims against all the
43 parties to whom the offer is made and:
44 (1) There is a single common theory of liability against all
45 the parties to whom the offer is made;
-
*AB505*

– 7 –
1 (2) The liability of one or more of the parties to whom the
2 offer is made is entirely derivative of the liability of the remaining
3 parties to whom the offer is made; or
4 (3) The liability of all the parties to whom the offer is made
5 is entirely derivative of a common act or omission by another
6 person.
7 (b) An offer of judgment made to multiple claimants unless the
8 same person is authorized to decide whether to settle the claims of
9 all the claimants to whom the offer is made and:
10 (1) There is a single common theory of liability claimed by
11 all the claimants to whom the offer is made;
12 (2) The damages claimed by one or more of the claimants to
13 whom the offer is made are entirely derivative of an injury to the
14 remaining claimants to whom the offer is made; or
15 (3) The damages claimed by all the claimants to whom the
16 offer is made are entirely derivative of an injury to another person.
17 Sec. 6. NRS 40.655 is hereby amended to read as follows:
18 40.655 1. [Except as otherwise provided in NRS 40.650, in]
19 In a claim governed by NRS 40.600 to 40.695, inclusive, the
20 claimant may recover only the following damages to the extent
21 proximately caused by a constructional defect:
22 (a) The reasonable cost of any repairs already made that were
23 necessary and of any repairs yet to be made that are necessary to
24 cure any constructional defect that the contractor failed to cure and
25 the reasonable expenses of temporary housing reasonably necessary
26 during the repair;
27 (b) The reduction in market value of the residence or accessory
28 structure, if any, to the extent the reduction is because of structural
29 failure;
30 (c) The loss of the use of all or any part of the residence;
31 (d) The reasonable value of any other property damaged by the
32 constructional defect;
33 (e) Any additional costs reasonably incurred by the claimant,
34 including, but not limited to, any costs and fees incurred for the
35 retention of experts to:
36 (1) Ascertain the nature and extent of the constructional
37 defects;
38 (2) Evaluate appropriate corrective measures to estimate the
39 value of loss of use; and
40 (3) Estimate the value of loss of use, the cost of temporary
41 housing and the reduction of market value of the residence; and
42 (f) Any interest provided by statute [.] for damages otherwise
43 recoverable by the claimant pursuant to NRS 40.600 to 40.695,
44 inclusive.
-
*AB505*

– 8 –
1 2. If a contractor complies with the provisions of NRS 40.600
2 to 40.695, inclusive, the claimant may not recover from the
3 contractor, as a result of the constructional defect, any damages
4 other than damages authorized pursuant to NRS 40.600 to 40.695,
5 inclusive.
6 3. This section must not be construed as impairing any
7 contractual rights between a contractor and a subcontractor, supplier
8 or design professional.
9 4. As used in this section, “structural failure” means physical
10 damage to the load-bearing portion of a residence or appurtenance
11 caused by a failure of the load-bearing portion of the residence or
12 appurtenance.
13 Sec. 7. NRS 40.665 is hereby amended to read as follows:
14 40.665 In addition to any other method provided for settling a
15 claim pursuant to NRS 40.600 to 40.695, inclusive, a contractor
16 may, pursuant to a written agreement entered into with a claimant,
17 settle a claim by repurchasing the claimant’s residence and the real
18 property upon which it is located. The agreement may include
19 provisions which reimburse the claimant for:
20 1. The market value of the residence as if no constructional
21 defect existed, except that if a residence is less than 2 years of age
22 and was purchased from the contractor against whom the claim is
23 brought, the market value is the price at which the residence was
24 sold to the claimant;
25 2. The value of any improvements made to the property by a
26 person other than the contractor;
27 3. Reasonable attorney’s fees and fees for experts; and
28 4. Any costs, including costs and expenses for moving and
29 costs, points and fees for loans.
30 [ Any offer of settlement made that includes the items listed in
31 this section shall be deemed reasonable for the purposes of
32 subsection 1 of NRS 40.650.]
33 Sec. 8. NRS 40.680 is hereby amended to read as follows:
34 40.680 1. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter,
35 before a claimant commences an action or amends a complaint to
36 add a cause of action for a constructional defect against a contractor,
37 subcontractor, supplier or design professional, the matter must be
38 submitted to mediation, unless mediation is waived in writing by the
39 contractor, subcontractor, supplier or design professional [and the
40 claimant.] on or before the date by which the contractor,
41 subcontractor, supplier or design professional must send the
42 written response required by NRS 40.6472.
43 2. The claimant and each party alleged to have caused the
44 constructional defect must select a mediator by agreement. If the
45 claimant and the other parties fail to agree upon a mediator within
-
*AB505*

– 9 –
1 20 days after a mediator is first selected by the claimant, any party
2 may petition the American Arbitration Association, the Nevada
3 Arbitration Association, Nevada Dispute Resolution Services or any
4 other mediation service acceptable to the parties for the appointment
5 of a mediator. A mediator so appointed may discover only those
6 documents or records which are necessary to conduct the mediation.
7 The mediator shall convene the mediation within 30 days after the
8 matter is submitted to the mediator and shall complete the mediation
9 within 45 days after the matter is submitted to the mediator, unless
10 the parties agree to extend the time.
11 3. Before the mediation begins:
12 (a) The claimant shall deposit $50 with the mediation service;
13 and
14 (b) Each other party shall deposit with the mediation service, in
15 equal shares, the remaining amount estimated by the mediation
16 service as necessary to pay the fees and expenses of the mediator for
17 the first session of mediation and shall deposit additional amounts
18 demanded by the mediation service as incurred for that purpose.
19 4. [Unless otherwise agreed, the total fees for each day of
20 mediation and the mediator must not exceed $750 per day.
21 5.] If the parties do not reach an agreement concerning the
22 matter during mediation or if any party who is alleged to have
23 caused the constructional defect fails to pay the required fees and
24 appear, the claimant may commence an action or amend a complaint
25 to add a cause of action for the constructional defect in court and:
26 (a) The reasonable costs and fees of the mediation are
27 recoverable by the prevailing party as costs of the action.
28 (b) Any party may petition the court in which the action is
29 commenced for the appointment of a special master.
