Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides that a person who, by day or night, unlawfully enters or
2 unlawfully remains in a business structure with the intent to commit grand or petit
3 larceny, assault or battery on any person or any felony is guilty of the crime of
4 burglary of a business. (NRS 205.060) Section 1 of this bill removes the elements
5 of unlawfully entering or unlawfully remaining from the offense, thereby making it
6 a crime to enter any business structure with the intent to commit grand or petit
7 larceny, assault or battery on any person or any felony.
8 Existing law: (1) makes it a crime to knowingly participate directly or
9 indirectly in or engage in conduct with the intent to further an organized retail theft;
10 and (2) defines “organized retail theft” as committing, either alone or with any
11 other person or persons, a series of thefts of retail merchandise against one or more
12 merchants, either on the premises of a merchant or through the use of an Internet or
13 network site, in this State with the intent to return the merchandise to the merchant
14 for value or to resell, trade or barter the merchandise for value under certain
15 circumstances. (NRS 205.08345) Section 2 of this bill: (1) expands the crime of
16 organized retail theft by making it unlawful to buy, receive, possess or withhold
17 retail merchandise knowing that it was obtained through an organized retail theft or
18 under such circumstances as should have caused a reasonable person to know that it
19 was obtained through an organized retail theft, whether or not the person involved

– 2 –
20 in the theft committed in the organized retail theft is or has been prosecuted or
21 convicted for the offense; (2) defines “retail merchandise” for purposes of the crime
22 of organized retail theft; and (3) revises the definition of “organized retail theft” to
23 include a single theft and remove the elements of the crime requiring the return of
24 the merchandise to the merchant for value or the reselling, trading or bartering of
25 such merchandise.
26 Existing law establishes certain crimes making it unlawful to take or obtain
27 property, including: (1) theft; (2) grand larceny; (3) petit larceny; and (4) receiving
28 or possessing stolen property. (NRS 205.0821-205.0835, 205.2175-205.2705,
29 205.275) Existing law provides that a person who commits theft is guilty of: (1) a
30 misdemeanor if the value of the property or services involved in the theft is less
31 than $1,200; (2) a category D felony if the value is $1,200 or more but less than
32 $5,000; (3) a category C felony if the value is $5,000 or more but less than $25,000;
33 (4) a category B felony, punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for a
34 minimum term of not less than 1 year and a maximum term of not more than 10
35 years, and by a fine of not more than $10,000, if the value is $25,000 or more but
36 less than $100,000; and (5) a category B felony punishable by imprisonment in the
37 state prison for a minimum term of not less than 1 year and a maximum term of not
38 more than 20 years, and by a fine of not more than $15,000, if the value is $100,000
39 or more. (NRS 205.0835) Section 3 of this bill reduces the felony theft threshold to
40 $650 and revises the tier of felony penalties based on the value of the property or
41 services involved in the theft. Sections 4-22 and 28-31 of this bill make
42 conforming changes to various theft and related offenses that use similar monetary
43 thresholds for purposes of determining the applicable criminal penalties.
44 Existing law: (1) authorizes a prosecuting attorney to prosecute a person as a
45 habitual criminal, habitual felon or habitually fraudulent felon under certain
46 conditions; and (2) prescribes the punishment for a habitual criminal, habitual felon
47 or habitually fraudulent felon. (NRS 207.010, 207.012, 207.014) Section 23 of this
48 bill: (1) authorizes a prosecuting attorney to prosecute a person as a habitual theft
49 offender if the person is convicted of certain theft offenses punishable as a
50 misdemeanor and has previously been convicted two or more times of certain theft
51 offenses punishable as a misdemeanor; and (2) makes the punishment for a habitual
52 theft offender a category B felony punishable by imprisonment in the state prison
53 for a minimum term of not less than 1 year and a maximum term of not more than
54 10 years. Sections 24-27, 32 and 33 of this bill make conforming changes for
55 consistency with the existing habitual criminal, habitual felon and habitually
56 fraudulent felon statutory scheme.

11 separately from the indictment or information charging the primary
12 offense, but if it is so filed, the count pursuant to NRS 207.010,

26 offense but denies any previous conviction charged, the court shall
27 determine the issue of the previous conviction after hearing all
28 relevant evidence presented on the issue by the prosecution and the
29 defendant. At such a hearing, the defendant may not challenge the

7 of a misdemeanor conviction is prima facie evidence of conviction
8 of a prior misdemeanor.
9 [6.] 7. Nothing in the provisions of this section, NRS 207.010,
10 207.012 or 207.014 or section 23 of this act prohibits a court from
11 imposing an adjudication of habitual criminality, adjudication of

3 execution of the sentence imposed or grant probation to the person.
4 (b) A category E felony, except as otherwise provided in this
5 paragraph, the court shall suspend the execution of the sentence
6 imposed and grant probation to the person. The court may, as it

9 sentencing, it is established that the person had previously been two
10 times convicted, whether in this State or elsewhere, of a crime that
11 under the laws of the situs of the crime or of this State would
12 amount to a felony. If the person denies the existence of a previous
13 conviction, the court shall determine the issue of the previous
14 conviction after hearing all relevant evidence presented on the issue
15 by the prosecution and the person. At such a hearing, the person
16 may not challenge the validity of a previous conviction. For the
17 purposes of this paragraph, a certified copy of a felony conviction is
18 prima facie evidence of conviction of a prior felony.
19 (c) Another felony, a gross misdemeanor or a misdemeanor, the
20 court may suspend the execution of the sentence imposed and grant
21 probation as the court deems advisable.
22 2. In determining whether to grant probation to a person, the

24 to participate in a program of probation secured by a surety bond
25 established pursuant to NRS 176A.300 to 176A.370, inclusive.
26 3. If the court determines that a person is otherwise eligible for

30 pursuant to the Program of Enhanced Supervision established

41 presentence investigation is not submitted by the Chief Parole and
42 Probation Officer within 45 days, the court may grant probation
43 without the report.

-
*SB264*

– 23 –
1 probation, consider the imposition of such conditions as would
2 facilitate timely payments by the person of an obligation, if any, for
