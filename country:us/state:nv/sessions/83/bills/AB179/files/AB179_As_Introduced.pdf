EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to employment; eliminating certain exceptions to
provisions requiring an employer in private employment
to provide paid leave to each employee of the employer
under certain circumstances; setting forth certain actions
that constitute retaliation for the purposes of provisions
prohibiting retaliation against an employee for use of such
paid leave; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 With certain exceptions, existing law requires an employer in private
2 employment who has 50 or more employees in this State to provide to an employee
3 at least 0.01923 hours of paid leave for each hour worked. Existing law requires
4 such an employer to allow an employee to use the paid leave beginning on the 90th
5 calendar day of his or her employment and for any use. Existing law prohibits such
6 an employer from retaliating against an employee for using the paid leave available
7 for use by the employee. (NRS 608.0197) This bill eliminates an exception from
8 those provisions that is provided under existing law to an employer who, pursuant
9 to a contract, policy, collective bargaining agreement or other agreement, provides
10 employees with a policy for paid leave or a policy for paid time off to all scheduled
11 employees at a rate of at least 0.01923 hours of paid leave per hour of work
12 performed. Additionally, this bill sets forth certain actions that constitute prohibited
13 retaliation for the purposes of the provisions prohibiting an employer from
14 retaliating against an employee for the use of paid leave.
