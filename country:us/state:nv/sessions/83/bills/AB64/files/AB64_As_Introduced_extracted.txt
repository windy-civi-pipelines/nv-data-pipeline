Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 The Open Meeting Law requires that meetings of public bodies be open to the
2 public, with limited exceptions set forth specifically in statute. (NRS 241.020)
3 Existing law defines the term “meeting” for purposes of the Open Meeting Law and
4 provides that the term does not include certain gatherings by members of a public
5 body to receive information from the attorney employed or retained by the public
6 body regarding potential or existing litigation involving a matter over which the
7 public body has supervision, control, jurisdiction or advisory power and to
8 deliberate toward a decision on the matter, or both. (NRS 241.015) Section 1 of this
-
*AB64*
– 2 –
9 bill provides instead that a “meeting” does not include certain gatherings by
10 members of a public body to: (1) receive legal advice from the attorney employed
11 or retained by the public body regarding a matter over which the public body has
12 supervision, control, jurisdiction or advisory power; and (2) deliberate on the
13 matter, provided such deliberation is limited to the legal advice.
14 Existing law requires a public body to take comments by the general public at
15 certain times during a meeting. (NRS 241.021) Existing law further requires a
16 public body to provide notice of all meetings at least 3 working days before the
17 meeting which must include certain information, including any restrictions on
18 comments by the general public. (NRS 241.020) Section 3 of this bill provides that
19 during each period devoted to public comment, each speaker must be allowed to
20 provide at least 3 minutes of public comment.
21 Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to provide that any restriction
22 relating to public comment on the agenda must be consistent with section 3.
23 Section 3 additionally authorizes a public body to refuse to accept public comment
24 relating to issues of fact or law in a contested case which is before the public body
25 until after that case has reached a final decision and any petition for judicial review
26 is concluded.
27 With certain exceptions, existing law authorizes a public body to conduct a
28 meeting by means of a remote technology system but prohibits a public body from
29 holding a meeting to consider a contested case or a regulation by means of a remote
30 technology system unless there is a physical location for the meeting where
31 members of the general public are permitted to attend and participate. (NRS
32 241.023) Section 4 of this bill prohibits instead a public body from holding a
33 meeting by means of a remote technology system unless there is a physical location
34 for the meeting where members of the general public are permitted to attend and
35 participate if, at the meeting, the public body will adjudicate certain contested cases
36 or hold a workshop or a hearing on a regulation.
37 Existing law further requires that if a meeting is conducted using a remote
38 technology system, clear and complete instructions for a member of the general
39 public to be able to call in to the meeting to provide public comment must be read
40 verbally before the first period of the day devoted to public comment. (NRS
41 241.023) Section 4 provides instead that such a requirement applies if the meeting
42 is conducted using a remote technology system and a physical location is not
43 designated for the meeting where members of the general public are permitted to
44 attend and participate.
45 Existing law provides certain privileges for statements and testimony made at a
46 public meeting, including an authorization, subject to a qualified privilege, for a
47 witness who is testifying before a public body to publish defamatory matter as
48 a part of a public meeting. (NRS 241.0353) Section 5 of this bill provides instead
49 that: (1) a witness who, subject to certain penalties relating to perjury, testifies
50 under oath before a public body may publish defamatory matter as part of a public
51 meeting; and (2) in general, no provision of the Open Meeting Law shall be
52 construed to affect any civil cause of action for defamation, libel, slander or any
53 similar cause of action arising from defamatory statements made by a member of
54 the public while he or she provides public comment to a public body.
55 Existing law provides that: (1) certain requirements of the Open Meeting Law
56 do not apply to proceedings relating to an investigation conducted to determine
57 whether to proceed with disciplinary action against a licensee unless the licensee
58 requests that the proceedings be conducted in such a manner; and (2) if the
59 regulatory body decides to proceed with disciplinary action against the licensee, all
60 proceedings that are conducted after that decision and are related to that
61 disciplinary action are subject to such provisions of the Open Meeting Law. (NRS
62 622.320) A “licensee” is a person who holds any license, certificate, registration,
63 permit or similar type of authorization issued by a regulatory body which has
-
*AB64*
– 3 –
64 authority to regulate certain occupations or professions. (NRS 622.040, 622.060)
65 Section 6 of this bill provides instead that: (1) the provisions of the Open Meeting
66 Law which require a meeting to be noticed and open to the public do not apply to
67 such proceedings unless the licensee requests that such proceedings be conducted
68 pursuant to those provisions; and (2) if the regulatory body decides to proceed with
69 disciplinary action against the licensee, all proceedings that are conducted after that
70 decision and are related to that disciplinary action are subject to all provisions of
71 the Open Meeting Law.

38 such restrictions must be reasonable and consistent with NRS
39 241.021 and may restrict the time, place and manner of the
40 comments, but may not restrict comments based upon viewpoint.
41 (8) If the meeting is being held using a remote technology

7 at least one copy of:
8 (a) An agenda for a public meeting;
9 (b) A proposed ordinance or regulation which will be discussed

8 technical problems with its website, to post supporting material
9 pursuant to this subsection shall not be deemed to be a violation of

18 the public body must allow the general public to comment on any
19 matter that is not specifically included on the agenda as an action
20 item at some time before adjournment of the meeting. No action

25 subsection 3 of NRS 241.020.
26 3. The provisions of subsections 1 and 2 do not prohibit a

28 to what is required pursuant to subsection 1 or 2.
29 4. If the agenda for a meeting authorizes the continuation of the
30 meeting of a public body to one or more other calendar days, the
31 public body must have a period devoted to comments by the general
32 public:

4 (b) Each member of the public body in attendance can
5 participate in the meeting.
6 4. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections 1, 2 and 3, a
7 public body may not hold a meeting [to consider] by means of a
8 remote technology system unless there is a physical location for
9 the meeting where members of the general public are permitted to
10 attend and participate if, at the meeting, the public body will:

22 day devoted to public comment, the clear and complete instructions
23 for a member of the general public to be able to call in to the
24 meeting to provide public comment, including, without limitation, a
25 telephone number or any necessary identification number of the
26 meeting or other access code, must be read verbally.
27 Sec. 5. NRS 241.0353 is hereby amended to read as follows:
28 241.0353 1. Any statement which is made by a member of a
29 public body during the course of a public meeting is absolutely
30 privileged and does not impose liability for defamation or constitute
31 a ground for recovery in any civil action.
32 2. [Subject to a qualified privilege, a] A witness who [is
33 testifying] testifies under oath, subject to the penalties set forth in
34 NRS 199.120, before a public body may publish defamatory matter
35 as part of a public meeting. It is unlawful to misrepresent any fact
36 knowingly when testifying before a public body.
37 3. Except as otherwise provided by law, nothing in this
38 chapter shall be construed to affect any civil cause of action for

A.B. 64
ASSEMBLY BILL NO. 64–COMMITTEE
ON GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS
(ON BEHALF OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL)
PREFILED NOVEMBER 20, 2024
____________
Referred to Committee on Government Affairs
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to public meetings.
(BDR 19-445)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public meetings; revising the definition of
“meeting” for purposes of the Open Meeting Law;
requiring that each speaker during a period devoted to
public comment be allowed a minimum time to provide
public comment; authorizing, under certain
circumstances, a public body to refuse to accept certain
public comment relating to a contested case; revising
provisions relating to requirements for meetings
conducted by means of a remote technology system;
revising provisions relating to privilege for certain
statements and testimony made at a public meeting;
revising provisions relating to the applicability of certain
provisions of the Open Meeting Law to certain
proceedings; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 The Open Meeting Law requires that meetings of public bodies be open to the
2 public, with limited exceptions set forth specifically in statute. (NRS 241.020)
3 Existing law defines the term “meeting” for purposes of the Open Meeting Law and
4 provides that the term does not include certain gatherings by members of a public
5 body to receive information from the attorney employed or retained by the public
6 body regarding potential or existing litigation involving a matter over which the
7 public body has supervision, control, jurisdiction or advisory power and to
8 deliberate toward a decision on the matter, or both. (NRS 241.015) Section 1 of this
-
*AB64*

– 2 –
9 bill provides instead that a “meeting” does not include certain gatherings by
10 members of a public body to: (1) receive legal advice from the attorney employed
11 or retained by the public body regarding a matter over which the public body has
12 supervision, control, jurisdiction or advisory power; and (2) deliberate on the
13 matter, provided such deliberation is limited to the legal advice.
14 Existing law requires a public body to take comments by the general public at
15 certain times during a meeting. (NRS 241.021) Existing law further requires a
16 public body to provide notice of all meetings at least 3 working days before the
17 meeting which must include certain information, including any restrictions on
18 comments by the general public. (NRS 241.020) Section 3 of this bill provides that
19 during each period devoted to public comment, each speaker must be allowed to
20 provide at least 3 minutes of public comment.
21 Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to provide that any restriction
22 relating to public comment on the agenda must be consistent with section 3.
23 Section 3 additionally authorizes a public body to refuse to accept public comment
24 relating to issues of fact or law in a contested case which is before the public body
25 until after that case has reached a final decision and any petition for judicial review
26 is concluded.
27 With certain exceptions, existing law authorizes a public body to conduct a
28 meeting by means of a remote technology system but prohibits a public body from
29 holding a meeting to consider a contested case or a regulation by means of a remote
30 technology system unless there is a physical location for the meeting where
31 members of the general public are permitted to attend and participate. (NRS
32 241.023) Section 4 of this bill prohibits instead a public body from holding a
33 meeting by means of a remote technology system unless there is a physical location
34 for the meeting where members of the general public are permitted to attend and
35 participate if, at the meeting, the public body will adjudicate certain contested cases
36 or hold a workshop or a hearing on a regulation.
37 Existing law further requires that if a meeting is conducted using a remote
38 technology system, clear and complete instructions for a member of the general
39 public to be able to call in to the meeting to provide public comment must be read
40 verbally before the first period of the day devoted to public comment. (NRS
41 241.023) Section 4 provides instead that such a requirement applies if the meeting
42 is conducted using a remote technology system and a physical location is not
43 designated for the meeting where members of the general public are permitted to
44 attend and participate.
45 Existing law provides certain privileges for statements and testimony made at a
46 public meeting, including an authorization, subject to a qualified privilege, for a
47 witness who is testifying before a public body to publish defamatory matter as
48 a part of a public meeting. (NRS 241.0353) Section 5 of this bill provides instead
49 that: (1) a witness who, subject to certain penalties relating to perjury, testifies
50 under oath before a public body may publish defamatory matter as part of a public
51 meeting; and (2) in general, no provision of the Open Meeting Law shall be
52 construed to affect any civil cause of action for defamation, libel, slander or any
53 similar cause of action arising from defamatory statements made by a member of
54 the public while he or she provides public comment to a public body.
55 Existing law provides that: (1) certain requirements of the Open Meeting Law
56 do not apply to proceedings relating to an investigation conducted to determine
57 whether to proceed with disciplinary action against a licensee unless the licensee
58 requests that the proceedings be conducted in such a manner; and (2) if the
59 regulatory body decides to proceed with disciplinary action against the licensee, all
60 proceedings that are conducted after that decision and are related to that
61 disciplinary action are subject to such provisions of the Open Meeting Law. (NRS
62 622.320) A “licensee” is a person who holds any license, certificate, registration,
63 permit or similar type of authorization issued by a regulatory body which has
-
*AB64*

– 3 –
64 authority to regulate certain occupations or professions. (NRS 622.040, 622.060)
65 Section 6 of this bill provides instead that: (1) the provisions of the Open Meeting
66 Law which require a meeting to be noticed and open to the public do not apply to
67 such proceedings unless the licensee requests that such proceedings be conducted
68 pursuant to those provisions; and (2) if the regulatory body decides to proceed with
69 disciplinary action against the licensee, all proceedings that are conducted after that
70 decision and are related to that disciplinary action are subject to all provisions of
71 the Open Meeting Law.

12 241.020 1. Except as otherwise provided by specific statute,
13 all meetings of public bodies must be open and public, and all
14 persons must be permitted to attend any meeting of these public
15 bodies at a physical location or by means of a remote technology
16 system. A meeting that is closed pursuant to a specific statute may
17 only be closed to the extent specified in the statute allowing the

20 provisions of this chapter to the extent not specifically precluded by
21 the specific statute. Public officers and employees responsible for
22 these meetings shall make reasonable efforts to assist and

24 2. If any portion of a meeting is open to the public, the public
25 officers and employees responsible for the meeting must make
26 reasonable efforts to ensure the facilities for the meeting are large
27 enough to accommodate the anticipated number of attendees. No
28 violation of this chapter occurs if a member of the public is not
