~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public meetings; revising the definition of “meeting” for
purposes of the Open Meeting Law; [authorizing, under certain
circumstances, a public body to refuse to accept certain public
comment relating to a contested case;] revising provisions relating to
requirements for meetings conducted by means of a remote technology
system; revising provisions relating to privilege for certain statements
and testimony made at a public meeting; revising provisions relating to
the applicability of certain provisions of the Open Meeting Law to
certain proceedings; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 The Open Meeting Law requires that meetings of public bodies be open to the public,
2 with limited exceptions set forth specifically in statute. (NRS 241.020) Existing law defines
3 the term “meeting” for purposes of the Open Meeting Law and provides that the term does not
4 include certain gatherings by members of a public body to receive information from the
5 attorney employed or retained by the public body regarding potential or existing litigation
6 involving a matter over which the public body has supervision, control, jurisdiction or
7 advisory power and to deliberate toward a decision on the matter, or both. (NRS 241.015)
8 Section 1 of this bill provides instead that a “meeting” does not include certain gatherings by
9 members of a public body to: (1) receive legal advice from the attorney employed or retained
10 by the public body regarding a matter over which the public body has supervision, control,
11 jurisdiction or advisory power; and (2) deliberate on the matter, provided such deliberation is
12 limited to the legal advice.
13 [Existing law requires a public body to take comments by the general public at certain
14 times during a meeting. (NRS 241.021) Existing law further requires a public body to provide
15 notice of all meetings at least 3 working days before the meeting which must include certain
16 information, including any restrictions on comments by the general public. (NRS 241.020)
17 Section 3 of this bill authorizes a public body to refuse to accept public comment relating to
18 issues of fact or law in a contested case which is before the public body until after that case
19 has reached a final decision and any petition for judicial review is concluded. Section 2 of this

Assembly Amendment No. 593 to Assembly Bill No. 64 First Reprint Page 4
20 bill makes a conforming change to provide that any restriction relating to public comment
21 must be consistent with section 3.]
22 With certain exceptions, existing law authorizes a public body to conduct a meeting by
23 means of a remote technology system but prohibits a public body from holding a meeting to
24 consider a contested case or a regulation by means of a remote technology system unless there
25 is a physical location for the meeting where members of the general public are permitted to
26 attend and participate. (NRS 241.023) Section 4 of this bill prohibits instead a public body
27 from holding a meeting by means of a remote technology system unless there is a physical
28 location for the meeting where members of the general public are permitted to attend and
29 participate if, at the meeting, the public body will adjudicate certain contested cases or hold a
30 workshop or a hearing on a regulation.
31 Existing law further requires that if a meeting is conducted using a remote technology
32 system, clear and complete instructions for a member of the general public to be able to call in
33 to the meeting to provide public comment must be read verbally before the first period of the
34 day devoted to public comment. (NRS 241.023) Section 4 provides instead that such a
35 requirement applies if the meeting is conducted using a remote technology system and a
36 physical location is not designated for the meeting where members of the general public are
37 permitted to attend and participate.
38 Existing law provides certain privileges for statements and testimony made at a public
39 meeting, including an authorization, subject to a qualified privilege, for a witness who is
40 testifying before a public body to publish defamatory matter as a part of a public meeting.
41 (NRS 241.0353) Section 5 of this bill provides instead that: (1) a witness who, subject to
42 certain penalties relating to perjury, testifies under oath before a public body may publish
43 defamatory matter as part of a public meeting; and (2) in general, no provision of the Open
44 Meeting Law shall be construed to affect any civil cause of action for defamation, libel,
45 slander or any similar cause of action arising from defamatory statements made by a member
46 of the public while he or she provides public comment to a public body.
47 Existing law provides that: (1) certain requirements of the Open Meeting Law do not
48 apply to proceedings relating to an investigation conducted to determine whether to proceed
49 with disciplinary action against a licensee unless the licensee requests that the proceedings be
50 conducted in such a manner; and (2) if the regulatory body decides to proceed with
51 disciplinary action against the licensee, all proceedings that are conducted after that decision
52 and are related to that disciplinary action are subject to such provisions of the Open Meeting
53 Law. (NRS 622.320) A “licensee” is a person who holds any license, certificate, registration,
54 permit or similar type of authorization issued by a regulatory body which has authority to
55 regulate certain occupations or professions. (NRS 622.040, 622.060) Section 6 of this bill
56 provides instead that: (1) the provisions of the Open Meeting Law which require a meeting to
57 be noticed and open to the public do not apply to such proceedings unless the licensee
58 requests that such proceedings be conducted pursuant to those provisions; and (2) if the
59 regulatory body decides to proceed with disciplinary action against the licensee, all
60 proceedings that are conducted after that decision and are related to that disciplinary action are
61 subject to all provisions of the Open Meeting Law.

12 anticipated number of attendees. Nothing in this subsection requires a public body

5 the time, place and manner of the comments, but may not restrict comments based
6 upon viewpoint.
7 (8) If the meeting is being held using a remote technology system pursuant
8 to NRS 241.023 and does not have a physical location designated for the meeting
9 where members of the general public are permitted to attend and participate, clear
10 and complete instructions for a member of the general public to be able to call in to

36 5. For each of its meetings, a public body shall document in writing that the

44 notice.
45 6. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (a) of subsection 4, if a public
46 body maintains a website on the Internet or its successor, the public body shall post
47 notice of each of its meetings on its website unless the public body is unable to do
48 so because of technical problems relating to the operation or maintenance of its
49 website. Notice posted pursuant to this subsection is supplemental to and is not a
50 substitute for the minimum public notice required pursuant to subsection 4. The
51 inability of a public body to post notice of a meeting pursuant to this subsection as a
52 result of technical problems with its website shall not be deemed to be a violation
53 of the provisions of this chapter.

Assembly Amendment No. 593 to Assembly Bill No. 64 First Reprint Page 9

2 copy of:

7 supporting material provided to the members of the public body for an item on the
8 agenda, except materials:
9 (1) Submitted to the public body pursuant to a nondisclosure or
10 confidentiality agreement which relates to proprietary information;
11 (2) Pertaining to the closed portion of such a meeting of the public body; or
12 (3) Declared confidential by law, unless otherwise agreed to by each
13 person whose interest is being protected under the order of confidentiality.
14  The public body shall make at least one copy of the documents described in
15 paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) available to the public at the meeting to which the

19 288.153, a copy of supporting material required to be provided upon request

34 later than the time the material is provided to the members of the governing body
35 or, if the supporting material is provided to the members of the governing body at a
36 meeting, not later than 24 hours after the conclusion of the meeting. Such posting is
37 supplemental to the right of the public to request the supporting material pursuant
38 to subsection 7. The inability of the governing body, as a result of technical
39 problems with its website, to post supporting material pursuant to this subsection
40 shall not be deemed to be a violation of the provisions of this chapter.

47 body is required to post the public notice, information or supporting material on its
48 website pursuant to this section, the public body shall inquire of a person who
49 requests the notice, information or supporting material if the person will accept by

Assembly Amendment No. 593 to Assembly Bill No. 64 First Reprint Page 10
1 receive such notice, information, supporting material or link by electronic mail
2 shall not be deemed to be a violation of the provisions of this chapter.

31 the general public to comment on any matter that is not specifically included on the
32 agenda as an action item at some time before adjournment of the meeting. No
33 action may be taken upon a matter raised during a period devoted to comments by
34 the general public until the matter itself has been specifically included on an agenda
35 as an item upon which action may be taken pursuant to subparagraph (2) of
36 paragraph (d) of subsection 3 of NRS 241.020.
37 3. The provisions of subsections 1 and 2 do not prohibit a public body from

41 public body to one or more other calendar days, the public body must have a period
42 devoted to comments by the general public:
