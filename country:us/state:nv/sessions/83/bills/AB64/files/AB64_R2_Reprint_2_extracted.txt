SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to public meetings.
(BDR 19-445)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public meetings; revising the definition of
“meeting” for purposes of the Open Meeting Law;
revising provisions relating to requirements for meetings
conducted by means of a remote technology system;
revising provisions relating to privilege for certain
statements and testimony made at a public meeting;
revising provisions relating to the applicability of certain
provisions of the Open Meeting Law to certain
proceedings; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 The Open Meeting Law requires that meetings of public bodies be open to the
2 public, with limited exceptions set forth specifically in statute. (NRS 241.020)
3 Existing law defines the term “meeting” for purposes of the Open Meeting Law and
4 provides that the term does not include certain gatherings by members of a public
5 body to receive information from the attorney employed or retained by the public
6 body regarding potential or existing litigation involving a matter over which the
7 public body has supervision, control, jurisdiction or advisory power and to
8 deliberate toward a decision on the matter, or both. (NRS 241.015) Section 1 of this
9 bill provides instead that a “meeting” does not include certain gatherings by
10 members of a public body to: (1) receive legal advice from the attorney employed
11 or retained by the public body regarding a matter over which the public body has
12 supervision, control, jurisdiction or advisory power; and (2) deliberate on the
13 matter, provided such deliberation is limited to the legal advice.

14 With certain exceptions, existing law authorizes a public body to conduct a
15 meeting by means of a remote technology system but prohibits a public body from
16 holding a meeting to consider a contested case or a regulation by means of a remote
17 technology system unless there is a physical location for the meeting where
18 members of the general public are permitted to attend and participate. (NRS
19 241.023) Section 4 of this bill prohibits instead a public body from holding a
20 meeting by means of a remote technology system unless there is a physical location
21 for the meeting where members of the general public are permitted to attend and
22 participate if, at the meeting, the public body will adjudicate certain contested cases
23 or hold a workshop or a hearing on a regulation.
24 Existing law further requires that if a meeting is conducted using a remote
25 technology system, clear and complete instructions for a member of the general
26 public to be able to call in to the meeting to provide public comment must be read
27 verbally before the first period of the day devoted to public comment. (NRS
28 241.023) Section 4 provides instead that such a requirement applies if the meeting
29 is conducted using a remote technology system and a physical location is not
30 designated for the meeting where members of the general public are permitted to
31 attend and participate.
32 Existing law provides certain privileges for statements and testimony made at a
33 public meeting, including an authorization, subject to a qualified privilege, for a
34 witness who is testifying before a public body to publish defamatory matter as
35 a part of a public meeting. (NRS 241.0353) Section 5 of this bill provides instead
36 that: (1) a witness who, subject to certain penalties relating to perjury, testifies
37 under oath before a public body may publish defamatory matter as part of a public
38 meeting; and (2) in general, no provision of the Open Meeting Law shall be
39 construed to affect any civil cause of action for defamation, libel, slander or any
40 similar cause of action arising from defamatory statements made by a member of
41 the public while he or she provides public comment to a public body.
42 Existing law provides that: (1) certain requirements of the Open Meeting Law
43 do not apply to proceedings relating to an investigation conducted to determine
44 whether to proceed with disciplinary action against a licensee unless the licensee
45 requests that the proceedings be conducted in such a manner; and (2) if the
46 regulatory body decides to proceed with disciplinary action against the licensee, all
47 proceedings that are conducted after that decision and are related to that
48 disciplinary action are subject to such provisions of the Open Meeting Law. (NRS
49 622.320) A “licensee” is a person who holds any license, certificate, registration,
50 permit or similar type of authorization issued by a regulatory body which has
51 authority to regulate certain occupations or professions. (NRS 622.040, 622.060)
52 Section 6 of this bill provides instead that: (1) the provisions of the Open Meeting
53 Law which require a meeting to be noticed and open to the public do not apply to
54 such proceedings unless the licensee requests that such proceedings be conducted
55 pursuant to those provisions; and (2) if the regulatory body decides to proceed with
56 disciplinary action against the licensee, all proceedings that are conducted after that
57 decision and are related to that disciplinary action are subject to all provisions of
58 the Open Meeting Law.
