on Government Affairs
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to public meetings; revising the definition of
“meeting” for purposes of the Open Meeting Law; revising
provisions relating to requirements for meetings conducted
by means of a remote technology system; revising provisions
relating to privilege for certain statements and testimony
made at a public meeting; revising provisions relating to the
applicability of certain provisions of the Open Meeting Law
to certain proceedings; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
The Open Meeting Law requires that meetings of public bodies be open to the
public, with limited exceptions set forth specifically in statute. (NRS 241.020)
Existing law defines the term “meeting” for purposes of the Open Meeting Law and
provides that the term does not include certain gatherings by members of a public
body to receive information from the attorney employed or retained by the public
body regarding potential or existing litigation involving a matter over which the
public body has supervision, control, jurisdiction or advisory power and to
deliberate toward a decision on the matter, or both. (NRS 241.015) Section 1 of this
bill provides instead that a “meeting” does not include certain gatherings by
members of a public body to: (1) receive legal advice from the attorney employed
or retained by the public body regarding a matter over which the public body has
supervision, control, jurisdiction or advisory power; and (2) deliberate on the
matter, provided such deliberation is limited to the legal advice.
With certain exceptions, existing law authorizes a public body to conduct a
meeting by means of a remote technology system but prohibits a public body from
holding a meeting to consider a contested case or a regulation by means of a remote
technology system unless there is a physical location for the meeting where
members of the general public are permitted to attend and participate. (NRS
241.023) Section 4 of this bill prohibits instead a public body from holding a
meeting by means of a remote technology system unless there is a physical location
for the meeting where members of the general public are permitted to attend and
participate if, at the meeting, the public body will adjudicate certain contested cases
or hold a workshop or a hearing on a regulation.
Existing law further requires that if a meeting is conducted using a remote
technology system, clear and complete instructions for a member of the general
public to be able to call in to the meeting to provide public comment must be read
verbally before the first period of the day devoted to public comment. (NRS
241.023) Section 4 provides instead that such a requirement applies if the meeting
is conducted using a remote technology system and a physical location is not
designated for the meeting where members of the general public are permitted to
attend and participate.
Existing law provides certain privileges for statements and testimony made at a
public meeting, including an authorization, subject to a qualified privilege, for a
witness who is testifying before a public body to publish defamatory matter as
a part of a public meeting. (NRS 241.0353) Section 5 of this bill provides instead
that: (1) a witness who, subject to certain penalties relating to perjury, testifies

under oath before a public body may publish defamatory matter as part of a public
meeting; and (2) in general, no provision of the Open Meeting Law shall be
construed to affect any civil cause of action for defamation, libel, slander or any
similar cause of action arising from defamatory statements made by a member of
the public while he or she provides public comment to a public body.
Existing law provides that: (1) certain requirements of the Open Meeting Law
do not apply to proceedings relating to an investigation conducted to determine
whether to proceed with disciplinary action against a licensee unless the licensee
requests that the proceedings be conducted in such a manner; and (2) if the
regulatory body decides to proceed with disciplinary action against the licensee, all
proceedings that are conducted after that decision and are related to that
disciplinary action are subject to such provisions of the Open Meeting Law. (NRS
622.320) A “licensee” is a person who holds any license, certificate, registration,
permit or similar type of authorization issued by a regulatory body which has
authority to regulate certain occupations or professions. (NRS 622.040, 622.060)
Section 6 of this bill provides instead that: (1) the provisions of the Open Meeting
Law which require a meeting to be noticed and open to the public do not apply to
such proceedings unless the licensee requests that such proceedings be conducted
pursuant to those provisions; and (2) if the regulatory body decides to proceed with
disciplinary action against the licensee, all proceedings that are conducted after that
decision and are related to that disciplinary action are subject to all provisions of
the Open Meeting Law.
