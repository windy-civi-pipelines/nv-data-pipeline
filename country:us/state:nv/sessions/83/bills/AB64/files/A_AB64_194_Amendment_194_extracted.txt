Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public meetings; revising the definition of “meeting” for
purposes of the Open Meeting Law; [requiring that each speaker
during a period devoted to public comment be allowed a minimum
time to provide public comment;] authorizing, under certain
circumstances, a public body to refuse to accept certain public
comment relating to a contested case; revising provisions relating to
requirements for meetings conducted by means of a remote technology
system; revising provisions relating to privilege for certain statements
and testimony made at a public meeting; revising provisions relating to
the applicability of certain provisions of the Open Meeting Law to
certain proceedings; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 The Open Meeting Law requires that meetings of public bodies be open to the public,
2 with limited exceptions set forth specifically in statute. (NRS 241.020) Existing law defines
3 the term “meeting” for purposes of the Open Meeting Law and provides that the term does not
4 include certain gatherings by members of a public body to receive information from the
5 attorney employed or retained by the public body regarding potential or existing litigation
6 involving a matter over which the public body has supervision, control, jurisdiction or
7 advisory power and to deliberate toward a decision on the matter, or both. (NRS 241.015)
8 Section 1 of this bill provides instead that a “meeting” does not include certain gatherings by
9 members of a public body to: (1) receive legal advice from the attorney employed or retained
10 by the public body regarding a matter over which the public body has supervision, control,
11 jurisdiction or advisory power; and (2) deliberate on the matter, provided such deliberation is
12 limited to the legal advice.
13 Existing law requires a public body to take comments by the general public at certain
14 times during a meeting. (NRS 241.021) Existing law further requires a public body to provide
15 notice of all meetings at least 3 working days before the meeting which must include certain
16 information, including any restrictions on comments by the general public. (NRS 241.020)
Assembly Amendment No. 194 to Assembly Bill No. 64 Page 4
17 [Section 3 of this bill provides that during each period devoted to public comment, each
18 speaker must be allowed to provide at least 3 minutes of public comment.
19 Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to provide that any restriction relating to
20 public comment on the agenda must be consistent with section 3. Section 3 [additionally] of
21 this bill authorizes a public body to refuse to accept public comment relating to issues of fact
22 or law in a contested case which is before the public body until after that case has reached a
23 final decision and any petition for judicial review is concluded. Section 2 of this bill makes a
24 conforming change to provide that any restriction relating to public comment must be
25 consistent with section 3.
26 With certain exceptions, existing law authorizes a public body to conduct a meeting by
27 means of a remote technology system but prohibits a public body from holding a meeting to
28 consider a contested case or a regulation by means of a remote technology system unless there
29 is a physical location for the meeting where members of the general public are permitted to
30 attend and participate. (NRS 241.023) Section 4 of this bill prohibits instead a public body
31 from holding a meeting by means of a remote technology system unless there is a physical
32 location for the meeting where members of the general public are permitted to attend and
33 participate if, at the meeting, the public body will adjudicate certain contested cases or hold a
34 workshop or a hearing on a regulation.
35 Existing law further requires that if a meeting is conducted using a remote technology
36 system, clear and complete instructions for a member of the general public to be able to call in
37 to the meeting to provide public comment must be read verbally before the first period of the
38 day devoted to public comment. (NRS 241.023) Section 4 provides instead that such a
39 requirement applies if the meeting is conducted using a remote technology system and a
40 physical location is not designated for the meeting where members of the general public are
41 permitted to attend and participate.
42 Existing law provides certain privileges for statements and testimony made at a public
43 meeting, including an authorization, subject to a qualified privilege, for a witness who is
44 testifying before a public body to publish defamatory matter as a part of a public meeting.
45 (NRS 241.0353) Section 5 of this bill provides instead that: (1) a witness who, subject to
46 certain penalties relating to perjury, testifies under oath before a public body may publish
47 defamatory matter as part of a public meeting; and (2) in general, no provision of the Open
48 Meeting Law shall be construed to affect any civil cause of action for defamation, libel,
49 slander or any similar cause of action arising from defamatory statements made by a member
50 of the public while he or she provides public comment to a public body.
51 Existing law provides that: (1) certain requirements of the Open Meeting Law do not
52 apply to proceedings relating to an investigation conducted to determine whether to proceed
53 with disciplinary action against a licensee unless the licensee requests that the proceedings be
54 conducted in such a manner; and (2) if the regulatory body decides to proceed with
55 disciplinary action against the licensee, all proceedings that are conducted after that decision
56 and are related to that disciplinary action are subject to such provisions of the Open Meeting
57 Law. (NRS 622.320) A “licensee” is a person who holds any license, certificate, registration,
58 permit or similar type of authorization issued by a regulatory body which has authority to
59 regulate certain occupations or professions. (NRS 622.040, 622.060) Section 6 of this bill
60 provides instead that: (1) the provisions of the Open Meeting Law which require a meeting to
61 be noticed and open to the public do not apply to such proceedings unless the licensee
62 requests that such proceedings be conducted pursuant to those provisions; and (2) if the
63 regulatory body decides to proceed with disciplinary action against the licensee, all
64 proceedings that are conducted after that decision and are related to that disciplinary action are
65 subject to all provisions of the Open Meeting Law.

1 Sec. 2. NRS 241.020 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 241.020 1. Except as otherwise provided by specific statute, all meetings of
3 public bodies must be open and public, and all persons must be permitted to attend
4 any meeting of these public bodies at a physical location or by means of a remote
5 technology system. A meeting that is closed pursuant to a specific statute may only
6 be closed to the extent specified in the statute allowing the meeting to be closed. All
7 other portions of the meeting must be open and public, and the public body must
8 comply with all other provisions of this chapter to the extent not specifically
9 precluded by the specific statute. Public officers and employees responsible for
10 these meetings shall make reasonable efforts to assist and accommodate persons
11 with physical disabilities desiring to attend.
12 2. If any portion of a meeting is open to the public, the public officers and
13 employees responsible for the meeting must make reasonable efforts to ensure the
14 facilities for the meeting are large enough to accommodate the anticipated number
15 of attendees. No violation of this chapter occurs if a member of the public is not
16 permitted to attend a public meeting because the facilities for the meeting have
17 reached maximum capacity if reasonable efforts were taken to accommodate the
18 anticipated number of attendees. Nothing in this subsection requires a public body
19 to incur any costs to secure a facility outside the control or jurisdiction of the public
20 body or to upgrade, improve or otherwise modify an existing facility to
21 accommodate the anticipated number of attendees.
22 3. Except in an emergency, written notice of all meetings must be given at

28 (2) Participate in the meeting by telephone; and
29 (3) Provide live public comment during the meeting and, if authorized by
30 the public body, provide prerecorded public comment.
31 (b) A list of the locations where the notice has been posted.
32 (c) The name, contact information and business address for the person
33 designated by the public body from whom a member of the public may request the
34 supporting material for the meeting described in subsection 7 and:
35 (1) A list of the locations where the supporting material is available to the
36 public; or
37 (2) Information about how the supporting material may be found on the
38 Internet website of the public body.
39 (d) An agenda consisting of:
40 (1) A clear and complete statement of the topics scheduled to be
41 considered during the meeting.
42 (2) A list describing the items on which action may be taken and clearly
43 denoting that action may be taken on those items by placing the term “for possible
44 action” next to the appropriate item or, if the item is placed on the agenda pursuant
45 to NRS 241.0365, by placing the term “for possible corrective action” next to the
46 appropriate item.
47 (3) Periods devoted to comments by the general public, if any, and
48 discussion of those comments.
49 (4) If any portion of the meeting will be closed to consider the character,
50 alleged misconduct or professional competence of a person, the name of the person
51 whose character, alleged misconduct or professional competence will be
52 considered.

2 whether to take administrative action regarding a person, the name of that person.
3 (6) Notification that:
4 (I) Items on the agenda may be taken out of order;
5 (II) The public body may combine two or more agenda items for
6 consideration; and
7 (III) The public body may remove an item from the agenda or delay
8 discussion relating to an item on the agenda at any time.
9 (7) Any restrictions on comments by the general public. Any such
10 restrictions must be reasonable and consistent with NRS 241.021 and may restrict
11 the time, place and manner of the comments, but may not restrict comments based
12 upon viewpoint.
13 (8) If the meeting is being held using a remote technology system pursuant
14 to NRS 241.023 and does not have a physical location designated for the meeting
15 where members of the general public are permitted to attend and participate, clear
16 and complete instructions for a member of the general public to be able to call in to
17 the meeting to provide public comment, including, without limitation, a telephone
18 number and any necessary identification number of the meeting or other access
19 code.

22 the meeting has a physical location, at the building in which the meeting is to be
23 held. If the meeting is held using a remote technology system pursuant to NRS

25 the Internet website of the public body not later than 9 a.m. of the third working day
26 before the meeting is to be held unless the public body is unable to do so because of
27 technical problems relating to the operation or maintenance of the Internet website
28 of the public body.
29 (b) Posting the notice on the official website of the State pursuant to NRS
30 232.2175 not later than 9 a.m. of the third working day before the meeting is to be

32 relating to the operation or maintenance of the official website of the State.
33 (c) Providing a copy of the notice to any person who has requested notice of
34 the meetings of the public body. A request for notice lapses 6 months after it is
35 made. The public body shall inform the requester of this fact by enclosure with,
36 notation upon or text included within the first notice sent. The notice must be:
37 (1) Delivered to the postal service used by the public body not later than 9
38 a.m. of the third working day before the meeting for transmittal to the requester by
39 regular mail; or
40 (2) Transmitted to the requester by electronic mail sent not later than 9
41 a.m. of the third working day before the meeting.
42 5. For each of its meetings, a public body shall document in writing that the
43 public body complied with the minimum public notice required by paragraph (a) of
44 subsection 4. The documentation must be prepared by every person who posted a
45 copy of the public notice and include, without limitation:
46 (a) The date and time when the person posted the copy of the public notice;
47 (b) The address of the location where the person posted the copy of the public
48 notice; and
49 (c) The name, title and signature of the person who posted the copy of the
50 notice.
51 6. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (a) of subsection 4, if a public
52 body maintains a website on the Internet or its successor, the public body shall post
53 notice of each of its meetings on its website unless the public body is unable to do
Assembly Amendment No. 194 to Assembly Bill No. 64 Page 9
1 so because of technical problems relating to the operation or maintenance of its
2 website. Notice posted pursuant to this subsection is supplemental to and is not a
3 substitute for the minimum public notice required pursuant to subsection 4. The
4 inability of a public body to post notice of a meeting pursuant to this subsection as a
5 result of technical problems with its website shall not be deemed to be a violation
6 of the provisions of this chapter.
7 7. Upon any request, a public body shall provide, at no charge, at least one
8 copy of:
9 (a) An agenda for a public meeting;
10 (b) A proposed ordinance or regulation which will be discussed at the public
11 meeting; and
12 (c) Subject to the provisions of subsection 8 or 9, as applicable, any other
13 supporting material provided to the members of the public body for an item on the
14 agenda, except materials:
15 (1) Submitted to the public body pursuant to a nondisclosure or
16 confidentiality agreement which relates to proprietary information;
17 (2) Pertaining to the closed portion of such a meeting of the public body; or
18 (3) Declared confidential by law, unless otherwise agreed to by each
19 person whose interest is being protected under the order of confidentiality.
20  The public body shall make at least one copy of the documents described in
21 paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) available to the public at the meeting to which the
22 documents pertain. As used in this subsection, “proprietary information” has the
23 meaning ascribed to it in NRS 332.025.
24 8. Unless it must be made available at an earlier time pursuant to NRS
25 288.153, a copy of supporting material required to be provided upon request
26 pursuant to paragraph (c) of subsection 7 must be:
27 (a) If the supporting material is provided to the members of the public body
28 before the meeting, made available to the requester at the time the material is
29 provided to the members of the public body; or
30 (b) If the supporting material is provided to the members of the public body at
31 the meeting, made available at the meeting to the requester at the same time the
32 material is provided to the members of the public body.
33  If the requester has agreed to receive the information and material set forth in
34 subsection 7 by electronic mail, the public body shall, if feasible, provide the
35 information and material by electronic mail.
36 9. Unless the supporting material must be posted at an earlier time pursuant to
37 NRS 288.153, and except as otherwise provided in subsection 11, the governing
38 body of a county or city whose population is 52,000 or more shall post the
39 supporting material described in paragraph (c) of subsection 7 to its website not
40 later than the time the material is provided to the members of the governing body
41 or, if the supporting material is provided to the members of the governing body at a
42 meeting, not later than 24 hours after the conclusion of the meeting. Such posting is
43 supplemental to the right of the public to request the supporting material pursuant
44 to subsection 7. The inability of the governing body, as a result of technical
45 problems with its website, to post supporting material pursuant to this subsection
46 shall not be deemed to be a violation of the provisions of this chapter.
47 10. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 11, a public body may provide
48 the public notice, information or supporting material required by this section by
49 electronic mail. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, if a public body
50 makes such notice, information or supporting material available by electronic mail,
51 the public body shall inquire of a person who requests the notice, information or
52 supporting material if the person will accept receipt by electronic mail. If a public
53 body is required to post the public notice, information or supporting material on its
Assembly Amendment No. 194 to Assembly Bill No. 64 Page 10
1 website pursuant to this section, the public body shall inquire of a person who
2 requests the notice, information or supporting material if the person will accept by
3 electronic mail a link to the posting on the website when the documents are made
4 available. The inability of a public body, as a result of technical problems with its
5 electronic mail system, to provide a public notice, information or supporting
6 material or a link to a website required by this section to a person who has agreed to
7 receive such notice, information, supporting material or link by electronic mail
8 shall not be deemed to be a violation of the provisions of this chapter.
9 11. If a public body holds a meeting using a remote technology system
10 pursuant to NRS 241.023 and has no physical location for the meeting, the public
11 body must:
12 (a) Have an Internet website; and
13 (b) Post to its Internet website:
14 (1) The public notice required by this section; and
15 (2) Supporting material not later than the time the material is provided to
16 the members of the governing body or, if the supporting material is provided to the
17 members of the governing body at a meeting, not later than 24 hours after the
18 conclusion of the meeting.
19  The inability of the governing body, as a result of technical problems with its
20 Internet website, to post supporting material pursuant to this subsection shall not be
21 deemed to be a violation of the provisions of this chapter.
22 12. As used in this section, “emergency” means an unforeseen circumstance
23 which requires immediate action and includes, but is not limited to:
24 (a) Disasters caused by fire, flood, earthquake or other natural causes; or
25 (b) Any impairment of the health and safety of the public.
26 Sec. 3. NRS 241.021 is hereby amended to read as follows:
27 241.021 1. Except as otherwise provided in this section, comments by the
28 general public must be taken by a public body:
29 (a) At the beginning of the meeting before any items on which action may be
30 taken are heard by the public body and again before the adjournment of the
31 meeting; or
32 (b) After each item on the agenda on which action may be taken is discussed
33 by the public body, but before the public body takes action on the item.
34 2. Regardless of whether a public body takes comments from the general
35 public pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) of subsection 1, the public body must allow
36 the general public to comment on any matter that is not specifically included on the
37 agenda as an action item at some time before adjournment of the meeting. No
38 action may be taken upon a matter raised during a period devoted to comments by
39 the general public until the matter itself has been specifically included on an agenda
40 as an item upon which action may be taken pursuant to subparagraph (2) of
41 paragraph (d) of subsection 3 of NRS 241.020.
42 3. The provisions of subsections 1 and 2 do not prohibit a public body from
43 taking comments by the general public in addition to what is required pursuant to
44 subsection 1 or 2.
45 4. If the agenda for a meeting authorizes the continuation of the meeting of a
46 public body to one or more other calendar days, the public body must have a period
47 devoted to comments by the general public:
48 (a) At the beginning of each day that the meeting is held before any item on
49 which action may be taken is heard by the public body and again before the
50 meeting recesses for the day or the adjournment of the meeting; or
51 (b) After each item on the agenda on which action may be taken is discussed
52 by the public body, but before the public body takes action on the item.
Assembly Amendment No. 194 to Assembly Bill No. 64 Page 11
1 5. [During each period devoted to public comment, each speaker must be
2 allowed to provide to the public body at least 3 minutes of public comment.
3 6.] A public body may refuse to accept public comment relating to issues of
4 fact or law in a contested case, as defined in NRS 233B.032, which is before the
5 public body until after that case has reached a final decision and any pending
6 petition for judicial review is concluded.
7 Sec. 4. NRS 241.023 is hereby amended to read as follows:
8 241.023 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2, a public body may
9 conduct a meeting by means of a remote technology system if:
10 (a) A quorum is actually or collectively present, whether in person, by using
11 the remote technology system or by means of electronic communication.
12 (b) Members of the public are permitted to:
13 (1) Attend and participate at a physical location designated for the meeting
14 where members of the public are permitted to attend and participate; or
15 (2) Hear and observe the meeting, participate in the meeting by telephone
16 and provide live public comment during the meeting using the remote technology
17 system. A public body may also allow public comment by means of prerecorded
18 messages.
19 (c) The public body reasonably ensures that any person who is not a member of
20 the public body or a member of the public but is otherwise required or allowed to
21 participate in the meeting is able to participate in the portion of the meeting that
22 pertains to the person using the remote technology system. The public body shall be
23 deemed to have complied with the requirements of this paragraph if the public body
24 provides the person with a web-based link and a telephone number, in case of
25 technical difficulties, that allows the person in real time to attend and participate in
26 the meeting. Nothing in this paragraph requires a public body to provide a person
27 with technical support to address the person’s individual hardware, software or
28 other technical issues.
29 2. If all members of a public body:
30 (a) Are required to be elected officials, the public body shall not conduct a
31 meeting by means of a remote technology system without a physical location
32 designated for the meeting where members of the public are permitted to attend and
33 participate.
34 (b) Are not required to be elected officials, the public body shall not conduct a
35 meeting by means of a remote technology system without a physical location
36 designated for the meeting where members of the public are permitted to attend and
37 participate unless the public body complies with the provisions of subsection 11 of
38 NRS 241.020.
39 3. If any member of a public body attends a meeting by means of a remote
40 technology system, the chair of the public body, or his or her designee, must make
41 reasonable efforts to ensure that:
42 (a) Members of the public body and members of the public present at the
43 physical location of the meeting can hear or observe each member attending by a
44 remote technology system; and
45 (b) Each member of the public body in attendance can participate in the
46 meeting.
47 4. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections 1, 2 and 3, a public body
48 may not hold a meeting [to consider] by means of a remote technology system
49 unless there is a physical location for the meeting where members of the general
50 public are permitted to attend and participate if, at the meeting, the public body
51 will:
52 (a) Adjudicate a contested case [, as defined in NRS 233B.032] for which
53 notice is required pursuant to NRS 233B.121; or
Assembly Amendment No. 194 to Assembly Bill No. 64 Page 12
1 (b) Hold a workshop or a hearing on a regulation [as defined in NRS
2 233B.038 by means of a remote technology system unless there is a physical
3 location for the meeting where members of the general public are permitted to
4 attend and participate.] pursuant to NRS 233B.040 to 233B.120, inclusive.
5 5. If a meeting is conducted pursuant to this section using a remote
6 technology system [,] and a physical location is not designated for the meeting
7 where members of the general public are permitted to attend and participate,
8 before the first period of the day devoted to public comment, the clear and complete
9 instructions for a member of the general public to be able to call in to the meeting
10 to provide public comment, including, without limitation, a telephone number or
11 any necessary identification number of the meeting or other access code, must be
12 read verbally.
13 Sec. 5. NRS 241.0353 is hereby amended to read as follows:
14 241.0353 1. Any statement which is made by a member of a public body
15 during the course of a public meeting is absolutely privileged and does not impose
16 liability for defamation or constitute a ground for recovery in any civil action.
17 2. [Subject to a qualified privilege, a] A witness who [is testifying] testifies
18 under oath, subject to the penalties set forth in NRS 199.120, before a public body
19 may publish defamatory matter as part of a public meeting. It is unlawful to
20 misrepresent any fact knowingly when testifying before a public body.
21 3. Except as otherwise provided by law, nothing in this chapter shall be
22 construed to affect any civil cause of action for defamation, libel, slander or any
23 similar cause of action arising from defamatory statements made by a member of
24 the public while he or she provides public comment to a public body.
25 Sec. 6. NRS 622.320 is hereby amended to read as follows:
26 622.320 1. The provisions of chapter 241 of NRS [241.020] requiring a
27 meeting to be noticed and open to members of the public do not apply to
28 proceedings relating to an investigation conducted to determine whether to proceed
29 with disciplinary action against a licensee, unless the licensee requests that the
30 proceedings be conducted pursuant to those provisions.
31 2. If the regulatory body decides to proceed with disciplinary action against
32 the licensee, all proceedings that are conducted after that decision and are related to
33 that disciplinary action are subject to the provisions of chapter 241 of NRS .

Referred to Committee on Government Affairs
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to public meetings. (BDR 19-445)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public meetings; revising the definition of “meeting” for
purposes of the Open Meeting Law; [requiring that each speaker
during a period devoted to public comment be allowed a minimum
time to provide public comment;] authorizing, under certain
circumstances, a public body to refuse to accept certain public
comment relating to a contested case; revising provisions relating to
requirements for meetings conducted by means of a remote technology
system; revising provisions relating to privilege for certain statements
and testimony made at a public meeting; revising provisions relating to
the applicability of certain provisions of the Open Meeting Law to
certain proceedings; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 The Open Meeting Law requires that meetings of public bodies be open to the public,
2 with limited exceptions set forth specifically in statute. (NRS 241.020) Existing law defines
3 the term “meeting” for purposes of the Open Meeting Law and provides that the term does not
4 include certain gatherings by members of a public body to receive information from the
5 attorney employed or retained by the public body regarding potential or existing litigation
6 involving a matter over which the public body has supervision, control, jurisdiction or
7 advisory power and to deliberate toward a decision on the matter, or both. (NRS 241.015)
8 Section 1 of this bill provides instead that a “meeting” does not include certain gatherings by
9 members of a public body to: (1) receive legal advice from the attorney employed or retained
10 by the public body regarding a matter over which the public body has supervision, control,
11 jurisdiction or advisory power; and (2) deliberate on the matter, provided such deliberation is
12 limited to the legal advice.
13 Existing law requires a public body to take comments by the general public at certain
14 times during a meeting. (NRS 241.021) Existing law further requires a public body to provide
15 notice of all meetings at least 3 working days before the meeting which must include certain
16 information, including any restrictions on comments by the general public. (NRS 241.020)

Assembly Amendment No. 194 to Assembly Bill No. 64 Page 4
17 [Section 3 of this bill provides that during each period devoted to public comment, each
18 speaker must be allowed to provide at least 3 minutes of public comment.
19 Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to provide that any restriction relating to
20 public comment on the agenda must be consistent with section 3. Section 3 [additionally] of
21 this bill authorizes a public body to refuse to accept public comment relating to issues of fact
22 or law in a contested case which is before the public body until after that case has reached a
23 final decision and any petition for judicial review is concluded. Section 2 of this bill makes a
24 conforming change to provide that any restriction relating to public comment must be
25 consistent with section 3.
26 With certain exceptions, existing law authorizes a public body to conduct a meeting by
27 means of a remote technology system but prohibits a public body from holding a meeting to
28 consider a contested case or a regulation by means of a remote technology system unless there
29 is a physical location for the meeting where members of the general public are permitted to
30 attend and participate. (NRS 241.023) Section 4 of this bill prohibits instead a public body
31 from holding a meeting by means of a remote technology system unless there is a physical
32 location for the meeting where members of the general public are permitted to attend and
33 participate if, at the meeting, the public body will adjudicate certain contested cases or hold a
34 workshop or a hearing on a regulation.
35 Existing law further requires that if a meeting is conducted using a remote technology
36 system, clear and complete instructions for a member of the general public to be able to call in
37 to the meeting to provide public comment must be read verbally before the first period of the
38 day devoted to public comment. (NRS 241.023) Section 4 provides instead that such a
39 requirement applies if the meeting is conducted using a remote technology system and a
40 physical location is not designated for the meeting where members of the general public are
41 permitted to attend and participate.
42 Existing law provides certain privileges for statements and testimony made at a public
43 meeting, including an authorization, subject to a qualified privilege, for a witness who is
44 testifying before a public body to publish defamatory matter as a part of a public meeting.
45 (NRS 241.0353) Section 5 of this bill provides instead that: (1) a witness who, subject to
46 certain penalties relating to perjury, testifies under oath before a public body may publish
47 defamatory matter as part of a public meeting; and (2) in general, no provision of the Open
48 Meeting Law shall be construed to affect any civil cause of action for defamation, libel,
49 slander or any similar cause of action arising from defamatory statements made by a member
50 of the public while he or she provides public comment to a public body.
51 Existing law provides that: (1) certain requirements of the Open Meeting Law do not
52 apply to proceedings relating to an investigation conducted to determine whether to proceed
53 with disciplinary action against a licensee unless the licensee requests that the proceedings be
54 conducted in such a manner; and (2) if the regulatory body decides to proceed with
55 disciplinary action against the licensee, all proceedings that are conducted after that decision
56 and are related to that disciplinary action are subject to such provisions of the Open Meeting
57 Law. (NRS 622.320) A “licensee” is a person who holds any license, certificate, registration,
58 permit or similar type of authorization issued by a regulatory body which has authority to
59 regulate certain occupations or professions. (NRS 622.040, 622.060) Section 6 of this bill
60 provides instead that: (1) the provisions of the Open Meeting Law which require a meeting to
61 be noticed and open to the public do not apply to such proceedings unless the licensee
62 requests that such proceedings be conducted pursuant to those provisions; and (2) if the
63 regulatory body decides to proceed with disciplinary action against the licensee, all
64 proceedings that are conducted after that decision and are related to that disciplinary action are
65 subject to all provisions of the Open Meeting Law.

44 public body regarding [potential or existing litigation involving] a matter over

Assembly Amendment No. 194 to Assembly Bill No. 64 Page 7
1 Sec. 2. NRS 241.020 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 241.020 1. Except as otherwise provided by specific statute, all meetings of
3 public bodies must be open and public, and all persons must be permitted to attend
4 any meeting of these public bodies at a physical location or by means of a remote
5 technology system. A meeting that is closed pursuant to a specific statute may only
6 be closed to the extent specified in the statute allowing the meeting to be closed. All
7 other portions of the meeting must be open and public, and the public body must
8 comply with all other provisions of this chapter to the extent not specifically
9 precluded by the specific statute. Public officers and employees responsible for
10 these meetings shall make reasonable efforts to assist and accommodate persons
11 with physical disabilities desiring to attend.
12 2. If any portion of a meeting is open to the public, the public officers and
13 employees responsible for the meeting must make reasonable efforts to ensure the
14 facilities for the meeting are large enough to accommodate the anticipated number
15 of attendees. No violation of this chapter occurs if a member of the public is not
16 permitted to attend a public meeting because the facilities for the meeting have
17 reached maximum capacity if reasonable efforts were taken to accommodate the
18 anticipated number of attendees. Nothing in this subsection requires a public body
19 to incur any costs to secure a facility outside the control or jurisdiction of the public
20 body or to upgrade, improve or otherwise modify an existing facility to
21 accommodate the anticipated number of attendees.
22 3. Except in an emergency, written notice of all meetings must be given at

13 (8) If the meeting is being held using a remote technology system pursuant
14 to NRS 241.023 and does not have a physical location designated for the meeting
15 where members of the general public are permitted to attend and participate, clear

21 (a) Posting a copy of the notice at the principal office of the public body or, if
22 the meeting has a physical location, at the building in which the meeting is to be
23 held. If the meeting is held using a remote technology system pursuant to NRS

25 the Internet website of the public body not later than 9 a.m. of the third working day
26 before the meeting is to be held unless the public body is unable to do so because of
27 technical problems relating to the operation or maintenance of the Internet website
28 of the public body.
29 (b) Posting the notice on the official website of the State pursuant to NRS
30 232.2175 not later than 9 a.m. of the third working day before the meeting is to be
31 held, unless the public body is unable to do so because of technical problems
32 relating to the operation or maintenance of the official website of the State.
33 (c) Providing a copy of the notice to any person who has requested notice of
34 the meetings of the public body. A request for notice lapses 6 months after it is

38 a.m. of the third working day before the meeting for transmittal to the requester by
39 regular mail; or
40 (2) Transmitted to the requester by electronic mail sent not later than 9
41 a.m. of the third working day before the meeting.
42 5. For each of its meetings, a public body shall document in writing that the
43 public body complied with the minimum public notice required by paragraph (a) of
44 subsection 4. The documentation must be prepared by every person who posted a
45 copy of the public notice and include, without limitation:
46 (a) The date and time when the person posted the copy of the public notice;
47 (b) The address of the location where the person posted the copy of the public
48 notice; and
49 (c) The name, title and signature of the person who posted the copy of the
50 notice.
51 6. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (a) of subsection 4, if a public
52 body maintains a website on the Internet or its successor, the public body shall post
53 notice of each of its meetings on its website unless the public body is unable to do

Assembly Amendment No. 194 to Assembly Bill No. 64 Page 9
1 so because of technical problems relating to the operation or maintenance of its
2 website. Notice posted pursuant to this subsection is supplemental to and is not a
3 substitute for the minimum public notice required pursuant to subsection 4. The
4 inability of a public body to post notice of a meeting pursuant to this subsection as a
5 result of technical problems with its website shall not be deemed to be a violation
6 of the provisions of this chapter.
7 7. Upon any request, a public body shall provide, at no charge, at least one
8 copy of:
9 (a) An agenda for a public meeting;
10 (b) A proposed ordinance or regulation which will be discussed at the public
11 meeting; and
12 (c) Subject to the provisions of subsection 8 or 9, as applicable, any other
13 supporting material provided to the members of the public body for an item on the
14 agenda, except materials:
15 (1) Submitted to the public body pursuant to a nondisclosure or
16 confidentiality agreement which relates to proprietary information;
17 (2) Pertaining to the closed portion of such a meeting of the public body; or
18 (3) Declared confidential by law, unless otherwise agreed to by each
19 person whose interest is being protected under the order of confidentiality.
20  The public body shall make at least one copy of the documents described in
21 paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) available to the public at the meeting to which the
22 documents pertain. As used in this subsection, “proprietary information” has the
23 meaning ascribed to it in NRS 332.025.
24 8. Unless it must be made available at an earlier time pursuant to NRS
25 288.153, a copy of supporting material required to be provided upon request
26 pursuant to paragraph (c) of subsection 7 must be:
27 (a) If the supporting material is provided to the members of the public body
28 before the meeting, made available to the requester at the time the material is
29 provided to the members of the public body; or
30 (b) If the supporting material is provided to the members of the public body at
31 the meeting, made available at the meeting to the requester at the same time the
32 material is provided to the members of the public body.
33  If the requester has agreed to receive the information and material set forth in
34 subsection 7 by electronic mail, the public body shall, if feasible, provide the
35 information and material by electronic mail.
36 9. Unless the supporting material must be posted at an earlier time pursuant to
37 NRS 288.153, and except as otherwise provided in subsection 11, the governing
38 body of a county or city whose population is 52,000 or more shall post the
39 supporting material described in paragraph (c) of subsection 7 to its website not
40 later than the time the material is provided to the members of the governing body
41 or, if the supporting material is provided to the members of the governing body at a
42 meeting, not later than 24 hours after the conclusion of the meeting. Such posting is
43 supplemental to the right of the public to request the supporting material pursuant
44 to subsection 7. The inability of the governing body, as a result of technical
45 problems with its website, to post supporting material pursuant to this subsection
46 shall not be deemed to be a violation of the provisions of this chapter.
47 10. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 11, a public body may provide
48 the public notice, information or supporting material required by this section by
49 electronic mail. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, if a public body
50 makes such notice, information or supporting material available by electronic mail,
51 the public body shall inquire of a person who requests the notice, information or
52 supporting material if the person will accept receipt by electronic mail. If a public
53 body is required to post the public notice, information or supporting material on its

Assembly Amendment No. 194 to Assembly Bill No. 64 Page 10
1 website pursuant to this section, the public body shall inquire of a person who
2 requests the notice, information or supporting material if the person will accept by
3 electronic mail a link to the posting on the website when the documents are made
4 available. The inability of a public body, as a result of technical problems with its
5 electronic mail system, to provide a public notice, information or supporting
6 material or a link to a website required by this section to a person who has agreed to
7 receive such notice, information, supporting material or link by electronic mail
8 shall not be deemed to be a violation of the provisions of this chapter.
9 11. If a public body holds a meeting using a remote technology system
10 pursuant to NRS 241.023 and has no physical location for the meeting, the public
11 body must:
12 (a) Have an Internet website; and
13 (b) Post to its Internet website:
14 (1) The public notice required by this section; and
15 (2) Supporting material not later than the time the material is provided to
16 the members of the governing body or, if the supporting material is provided to the
17 members of the governing body at a meeting, not later than 24 hours after the
18 conclusion of the meeting.
19  The inability of the governing body, as a result of technical problems with its
20 Internet website, to post supporting material pursuant to this subsection shall not be
21 deemed to be a violation of the provisions of this chapter.
22 12. As used in this section, “emergency” means an unforeseen circumstance
23 which requires immediate action and includes, but is not limited to:
24 (a) Disasters caused by fire, flood, earthquake or other natural causes; or
25 (b) Any impairment of the health and safety of the public.
26 Sec. 3. NRS 241.021 is hereby amended to read as follows:
27 241.021 1. Except as otherwise provided in this section, comments by the
28 general public must be taken by a public body:
29 (a) At the beginning of the meeting before any items on which action may be
30 taken are heard by the public body and again before the adjournment of the
31 meeting; or
32 (b) After each item on the agenda on which action may be taken is discussed
33 by the public body, but before the public body takes action on the item.
34 2. Regardless of whether a public body takes comments from the general
35 public pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) of subsection 1, the public body must allow
36 the general public to comment on any matter that is not specifically included on the
37 agenda as an action item at some time before adjournment of the meeting. No
38 action may be taken upon a matter raised during a period devoted to comments by
39 the general public until the matter itself has been specifically included on an agenda
40 as an item upon which action may be taken pursuant to subparagraph (2) of
41 paragraph (d) of subsection 3 of NRS 241.020.
42 3. The provisions of subsections 1 and 2 do not prohibit a public body from
43 taking comments by the general public in addition to what is required pursuant to
44 subsection 1 or 2.
45 4. If the agenda for a meeting authorizes the continuation of the meeting of a
46 public body to one or more other calendar days, the public body must have a period
47 devoted to comments by the general public:
48 (a) At the beginning of each day that the meeting is held before any item on
49 which action may be taken is heard by the public body and again before the
50 meeting recesses for the day or the adjournment of the meeting; or
51 (b) After each item on the agenda on which action may be taken is discussed
52 by the public body, but before the public body takes action on the item.

Assembly Amendment No. 194 to Assembly Bill No. 64 Page 11
1 5. [During each period devoted to public comment, each speaker must be
2 allowed to provide to the public body at least 3 minutes of public comment.
3 6.] A public body may refuse to accept public comment relating to issues of
4 fact or law in a contested case, as defined in NRS 233B.032, which is before the
5 public body until after that case has reached a final decision and any pending
6 petition for judicial review is concluded.
7 Sec. 4. NRS 241.023 is hereby amended to read as follows:
8 241.023 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2, a public body may
9 conduct a meeting by means of a remote technology system if:
10 (a) A quorum is actually or collectively present, whether in person, by using
11 the remote technology system or by means of electronic communication.
12 (b) Members of the public are permitted to:
13 (1) Attend and participate at a physical location designated for the meeting
14 where members of the public are permitted to attend and participate; or
15 (2) Hear and observe the meeting, participate in the meeting by telephone
16 and provide live public comment during the meeting using the remote technology
17 system. A public body may also allow public comment by means of prerecorded
18 messages.
19 (c) The public body reasonably ensures that any person who is not a member of
20 the public body or a member of the public but is otherwise required or allowed to
21 participate in the meeting is able to participate in the portion of the meeting that
22 pertains to the person using the remote technology system. The public body shall be
23 deemed to have complied with the requirements of this paragraph if the public body
24 provides the person with a web-based link and a telephone number, in case of
25 technical difficulties, that allows the person in real time to attend and participate in
26 the meeting. Nothing in this paragraph requires a public body to provide a person
27 with technical support to address the person’s individual hardware, software or
28 other technical issues.
29 2. If all members of a public body:
30 (a) Are required to be elected officials, the public body shall not conduct a
31 meeting by means of a remote technology system without a physical location
32 designated for the meeting where members of the public are permitted to attend and
33 participate.
34 (b) Are not required to be elected officials, the public body shall not conduct a
35 meeting by means of a remote technology system without a physical location
36 designated for the meeting where members of the public are permitted to attend and
37 participate unless the public body complies with the provisions of subsection 11 of
38 NRS 241.020.
39 3. If any member of a public body attends a meeting by means of a remote
40 technology system, the chair of the public body, or his or her designee, must make
41 reasonable efforts to ensure that:
42 (a) Members of the public body and members of the public present at the
43 physical location of the meeting can hear or observe each member attending by a
44 remote technology system; and
45 (b) Each member of the public body in attendance can participate in the
46 meeting.
47 4. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections 1, 2 and 3, a public body
48 may not hold a meeting [to consider] by means of a remote technology system
49 unless there is a physical location for the meeting where members of the general
50 public are permitted to attend and participate if, at the meeting, the public body
51 will:
52 (a) Adjudicate a contested case [, as defined in NRS 233B.032] for which
53 notice is required pursuant to NRS 233B.121; or

Assembly Amendment No. 194 to Assembly Bill No. 64 Page 12
1 (b) Hold a workshop or a hearing on a regulation [as defined in NRS
2 233B.038 by means of a remote technology system unless there is a physical
3 location for the meeting where members of the general public are permitted to
4 attend and participate.] pursuant to NRS 233B.040 to 233B.120, inclusive.
5 5. If a meeting is conducted pursuant to this section using a remote
6 technology system [,] and a physical location is not designated for the meeting
7 where members of the general public are permitted to attend and participate,
8 before the first period of the day devoted to public comment, the clear and complete
9 instructions for a member of the general public to be able to call in to the meeting
10 to provide public comment, including, without limitation, a telephone number or
11 any necessary identification number of the meeting or other access code, must be
12 read verbally.
13 Sec. 5. NRS 241.0353 is hereby amended to read as follows:
14 241.0353 1. Any statement which is made by a member of a public body
15 during the course of a public meeting is absolutely privileged and does not impose
16 liability for defamation or constitute a ground for recovery in any civil action.
17 2. [Subject to a qualified privilege, a] A witness who [is testifying] testifies
18 under oath, subject to the penalties set forth in NRS 199.120, before a public body
19 may publish defamatory matter as part of a public meeting. It is unlawful to
20 misrepresent any fact knowingly when testifying before a public body.
21 3. Except as otherwise provided by law, nothing in this chapter shall be
22 construed to affect any civil cause of action for defamation, libel, slander or any
23 similar cause of action arising from defamatory statements made by a member of
24 the public while he or she provides public comment to a public body.
25 Sec. 6. NRS 622.320 is hereby amended to read as follows:
26 622.320 1. The provisions of chapter 241 of NRS [241.020] requiring a
27 meeting to be noticed and open to members of the public do not apply to
28 proceedings relating to an investigation conducted to determine whether to proceed
29 with disciplinary action against a licensee, unless the licensee requests that the
30 proceedings be conducted pursuant to those provisions.
31 2. If the regulatory body decides to proceed with disciplinary action against
32 the licensee, all proceedings that are conducted after that decision and are related to
33 that disciplinary action are subject to the provisions of chapter 241 of NRS .
