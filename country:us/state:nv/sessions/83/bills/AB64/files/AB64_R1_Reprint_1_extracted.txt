AN ACT relating to public meetings; revising the definition of
“meeting” for purposes of the Open Meeting Law;
authorizing, under certain circumstances, a public body to
refuse to accept certain public comment relating to a
contested case; revising provisions relating to
requirements for meetings conducted by means of a
remote technology system; revising provisions relating to
privilege for certain statements and testimony made at a
public meeting; revising provisions relating to the
applicability of certain provisions of the Open Meeting
Law to certain proceedings; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 The Open Meeting Law requires that meetings of public bodies be open to the
2 public, with limited exceptions set forth specifically in statute. (NRS 241.020)
3 Existing law defines the term “meeting” for purposes of the Open Meeting Law and
4 provides that the term does not include certain gatherings by members of a public
5 body to receive information from the attorney employed or retained by the public
6 body regarding potential or existing litigation involving a matter over which the
7 public body has supervision, control, jurisdiction or advisory power and to
8 deliberate toward a decision on the matter, or both. (NRS 241.015) Section 1 of this
9 bill provides instead that a “meeting” does not include certain gatherings by
10 members of a public body to: (1) receive legal advice from the attorney employed
11 or retained by the public body regarding a matter over which the public body has
-
*AB64_R1*
– 2 –
12 supervision, control, jurisdiction or advisory power; and (2) deliberate on the
13 matter, provided such deliberation is limited to the legal advice.
14 Existing law requires a public body to take comments by the general public at
15 certain times during a meeting. (NRS 241.021) Existing law further requires a
16 public body to provide notice of all meetings at least 3 working days before the
17 meeting which must include certain information, including any restrictions on
18 comments by the general public. (NRS 241.020) Section 3 of this bill authorizes a
19 public body to refuse to accept public comment relating to issues of fact or law in
20 a contested case which is before the public body until after that case has reached a
21 final decision and any petition for judicial review is concluded. Section 2 of this
22 bill makes a conforming change to provide that any restriction relating to public
23 comment must be consistent with section 3.
24 With certain exceptions, existing law authorizes a public body to conduct a
25 meeting by means of a remote technology system but prohibits a public body from
26 holding a meeting to consider a contested case or a regulation by means of a remote
27 technology system unless there is a physical location for the meeting where
28 members of the general public are permitted to attend and participate. (NRS
29 241.023) Section 4 of this bill prohibits instead a public body from holding a
30 meeting by means of a remote technology system unless there is a physical location
31 for the meeting where members of the general public are permitted to attend and
32 participate if, at the meeting, the public body will adjudicate certain contested cases
33 or hold a workshop or a hearing on a regulation.
34 Existing law further requires that if a meeting is conducted using a remote
35 technology system, clear and complete instructions for a member of the general
36 public to be able to call in to the meeting to provide public comment must be read
37 verbally before the first period of the day devoted to public comment. (NRS
38 241.023) Section 4 provides instead that such a requirement applies if the meeting
39 is conducted using a remote technology system and a physical location is not
40 designated for the meeting where members of the general public are permitted to
41 attend and participate.
42 Existing law provides certain privileges for statements and testimony made at a
43 public meeting, including an authorization, subject to a qualified privilege, for a
44 witness who is testifying before a public body to publish defamatory matter as
45 a part of a public meeting. (NRS 241.0353) Section 5 of this bill provides instead
46 that: (1) a witness who, subject to certain penalties relating to perjury, testifies
47 under oath before a public body may publish defamatory matter as part of a public
48 meeting; and (2) in general, no provision of the Open Meeting Law shall be
49 construed to affect any civil cause of action for defamation, libel, slander or any
50 similar cause of action arising from defamatory statements made by a member of
51 the public while he or she provides public comment to a public body.
52 Existing law provides that: (1) certain requirements of the Open Meeting Law
53 do not apply to proceedings relating to an investigation conducted to determine
54 whether to proceed with disciplinary action against a licensee unless the licensee
55 requests that the proceedings be conducted in such a manner; and (2) if the
56 regulatory body decides to proceed with disciplinary action against the licensee, all
57 proceedings that are conducted after that decision and are related to that
58 disciplinary action are subject to such provisions of the Open Meeting Law. (NRS
59 622.320) A “licensee” is a person who holds any license, certificate, registration,
60 permit or similar type of authorization issued by a regulatory body which has
61 authority to regulate certain occupations or professions. (NRS 622.040, 622.060)
62 Section 6 of this bill provides instead that: (1) the provisions of the Open Meeting
63 Law which require a meeting to be noticed and open to the public do not apply to
64 such proceedings unless the licensee requests that such proceedings be conducted
65 pursuant to those provisions; and (2) if the regulatory body decides to proceed with
66 disciplinary action against the licensee, all proceedings that are conducted after that
-
*AB64_R1*
– 3 –
67 decision and are related to that disciplinary action are subject to all provisions of
68 the Open Meeting Law.

8 all meetings of public bodies must be open and public, and all

32 (7) Any restrictions on comments by the general public. Any
33 such restrictions must be reasonable and consistent with NRS
34 241.021 and may restrict the time, place and manner of the
35 comments, but may not restrict comments based upon viewpoint.
36 (8) If the meeting is being held using a remote technology
37 system pursuant to NRS 241.023 and does not have a physical
38 location designated for the meeting where members of the general
39 public are permitted to attend and participate, clear and complete

6 pursuant to this subsection shall not be deemed to be a violation of

13 the public body must allow the general public to comment on any
14 matter that is not specifically included on the agenda as an action
15 item at some time before adjournment of the meeting. No action
16 may be taken upon a matter raised during a period devoted to

20 subsection 3 of NRS 241.020.
21 3. The provisions of subsections 1 and 2 do not prohibit a

24 4. If the agenda for a meeting authorizes the continuation of the
25 meeting of a public body to one or more other calendar days, the

27 public:
28 (a) At the beginning of each day that the meeting is held before
29 any item on which action may be taken is heard by the public body
30 and again before the meeting recesses for the day or the
31 adjournment of the meeting; or
32 (b) After each item on the agenda on which action may be taken
33 is discussed by the public body, but before the public body takes
34 action on the item.
35 5. A public body may refuse to accept public comment
36 relating to issues of fact or law in a contested case, as defined in
37 NRS 233B.032, which is before the public body until after that
38 case has reached a final decision and any pending petition for

39 present at the physical location of the meeting can hear or observe
40 each member attending by a remote technology system; and
41 (b) Each member of the public body in attendance can
42 participate in the meeting.

*AB64_R1*
– 13 –
1 4. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections 1, 2 and 3, a
2 public body may not hold a meeting [to consider] by means of a
3 remote technology system unless there is a physical location for
4 the meeting where members of the general public are permitted to
5 attend and participate if, at the meeting, the public body will:
6 (a) Adjudicate a contested case [, as defined in NRS 233B.032]
7 for which notice is required pursuant to NRS 233B.121; or

13 5. If a meeting is conducted pursuant to this section using a
14 remote technology system [,] and a physical location is not
15 designated for the meeting where members of the general public
16 are permitted to attend and participate, before the first period of the
17 day devoted to public comment, the clear and complete instructions
18 for a member of the general public to be able to call in to the
19 meeting to provide public comment, including, without limitation, a
20 telephone number or any necessary identification number of the
21 meeting or other access code, must be read verbally.
22 Sec. 5. NRS 241.0353 is hereby amended to read as follows:
23 241.0353 1. Any statement which is made by a member of a
24 public body during the course of a public meeting is absolutely
25 privileged and does not impose liability for defamation or constitute
26 a ground for recovery in any civil action.
27 2. [Subject to a qualified privilege, a] A witness who [is
28 testifying] testifies under oath, subject to the penalties set forth in
29 NRS 199.120, before a public body may publish defamatory matter
30 as part of a public meeting. It is unlawful to misrepresent any fact
31 knowingly when testifying before a public body.
32 3. Except as otherwise provided by law, nothing in this
33 chapter shall be construed to affect any civil cause of action for
34 defamation, libel, slander or any similar cause of action arising
35 from defamatory statements made by a member of the public while
36 he or she provides public comment to a public body.
37 Sec. 6. NRS 622.320 is hereby amended to read as follows:

40 public do not apply to proceedings relating to an investigation
41 conducted to determine whether to proceed with disciplinary action
42 against a licensee, unless the licensee requests that the proceedings
43 be conducted pursuant to those provisions.
44 2. If the regulatory body decides to proceed with disciplinary
45 action against the licensee, all proceedings that are conducted after
-
*AB64_R1*
– 14 –

FIRST REPRINT A.B. 64
ASSEMBLY BILL NO. 64–COMMITTEE
ON GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS
(ON BEHALF OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL)
PREFILED NOVEMBER 20, 2024
____________
Referred to Committee on Government Affairs
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to public meetings.
(BDR 19-445)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public meetings; revising the definition of
“meeting” for purposes of the Open Meeting Law;
authorizing, under certain circumstances, a public body to
refuse to accept certain public comment relating to a
contested case; revising provisions relating to
requirements for meetings conducted by means of a
remote technology system; revising provisions relating to
privilege for certain statements and testimony made at a
public meeting; revising provisions relating to the
applicability of certain provisions of the Open Meeting
Law to certain proceedings; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 The Open Meeting Law requires that meetings of public bodies be open to the
2 public, with limited exceptions set forth specifically in statute. (NRS 241.020)
3 Existing law defines the term “meeting” for purposes of the Open Meeting Law and
4 provides that the term does not include certain gatherings by members of a public
5 body to receive information from the attorney employed or retained by the public
6 body regarding potential or existing litigation involving a matter over which the
7 public body has supervision, control, jurisdiction or advisory power and to
8 deliberate toward a decision on the matter, or both. (NRS 241.015) Section 1 of this
9 bill provides instead that a “meeting” does not include certain gatherings by
10 members of a public body to: (1) receive legal advice from the attorney employed
11 or retained by the public body regarding a matter over which the public body has
-
*AB64_R1*

– 2 –
12 supervision, control, jurisdiction or advisory power; and (2) deliberate on the
13 matter, provided such deliberation is limited to the legal advice.
14 Existing law requires a public body to take comments by the general public at
15 certain times during a meeting. (NRS 241.021) Existing law further requires a
16 public body to provide notice of all meetings at least 3 working days before the
17 meeting which must include certain information, including any restrictions on
18 comments by the general public. (NRS 241.020) Section 3 of this bill authorizes a
19 public body to refuse to accept public comment relating to issues of fact or law in
20 a contested case which is before the public body until after that case has reached a
21 final decision and any petition for judicial review is concluded. Section 2 of this
22 bill makes a conforming change to provide that any restriction relating to public
23 comment must be consistent with section 3.
24 With certain exceptions, existing law authorizes a public body to conduct a
25 meeting by means of a remote technology system but prohibits a public body from
26 holding a meeting to consider a contested case or a regulation by means of a remote
27 technology system unless there is a physical location for the meeting where
28 members of the general public are permitted to attend and participate. (NRS
29 241.023) Section 4 of this bill prohibits instead a public body from holding a
30 meeting by means of a remote technology system unless there is a physical location
31 for the meeting where members of the general public are permitted to attend and
32 participate if, at the meeting, the public body will adjudicate certain contested cases
33 or hold a workshop or a hearing on a regulation.
34 Existing law further requires that if a meeting is conducted using a remote
35 technology system, clear and complete instructions for a member of the general
36 public to be able to call in to the meeting to provide public comment must be read
37 verbally before the first period of the day devoted to public comment. (NRS
38 241.023) Section 4 provides instead that such a requirement applies if the meeting
39 is conducted using a remote technology system and a physical location is not
40 designated for the meeting where members of the general public are permitted to
41 attend and participate.
42 Existing law provides certain privileges for statements and testimony made at a
43 public meeting, including an authorization, subject to a qualified privilege, for a
44 witness who is testifying before a public body to publish defamatory matter as
45 a part of a public meeting. (NRS 241.0353) Section 5 of this bill provides instead
46 that: (1) a witness who, subject to certain penalties relating to perjury, testifies
47 under oath before a public body may publish defamatory matter as part of a public
48 meeting; and (2) in general, no provision of the Open Meeting Law shall be
49 construed to affect any civil cause of action for defamation, libel, slander or any
50 similar cause of action arising from defamatory statements made by a member of
51 the public while he or she provides public comment to a public body.
52 Existing law provides that: (1) certain requirements of the Open Meeting Law
53 do not apply to proceedings relating to an investigation conducted to determine
54 whether to proceed with disciplinary action against a licensee unless the licensee
55 requests that the proceedings be conducted in such a manner; and (2) if the
56 regulatory body decides to proceed with disciplinary action against the licensee, all
57 proceedings that are conducted after that decision and are related to that
58 disciplinary action are subject to such provisions of the Open Meeting Law. (NRS
59 622.320) A “licensee” is a person who holds any license, certificate, registration,
60 permit or similar type of authorization issued by a regulatory body which has
61 authority to regulate certain occupations or professions. (NRS 622.040, 622.060)
62 Section 6 of this bill provides instead that: (1) the provisions of the Open Meeting
63 Law which require a meeting to be noticed and open to the public do not apply to
64 such proceedings unless the licensee requests that such proceedings be conducted
65 pursuant to those provisions; and (2) if the regulatory body decides to proceed with
66 disciplinary action against the licensee, all proceedings that are conducted after that
-
*AB64_R1*

– 3 –
67 decision and are related to that disciplinary action are subject to all provisions of
68 the Open Meeting Law.

6 Sec. 2. NRS 241.020 is hereby amended to read as follows:
7 241.020 1. Except as otherwise provided by specific statute,
8 all meetings of public bodies must be open and public, and all
9 persons must be permitted to attend any meeting of these public
10 bodies at a physical location or by means of a remote technology
11 system. A meeting that is closed pursuant to a specific statute may
12 only be closed to the extent specified in the statute allowing the
13 meeting to be closed. All other portions of the meeting must be open
14 and public, and the public body must comply with all other
15 provisions of this chapter to the extent not specifically precluded by
16 the specific statute. Public officers and employees responsible for
17 these meetings shall make reasonable efforts to assist and
18 accommodate persons with physical disabilities desiring to attend.
19 2. If any portion of a meeting is open to the public, the public
20 officers and employees responsible for the meeting must make
21 reasonable efforts to ensure the facilities for the meeting are large
22 enough to accommodate the anticipated number of attendees. No
23 violation of this chapter occurs if a member of the public is not
24 permitted to attend a public meeting because the facilities for the
25 meeting have reached maximum capacity if reasonable efforts were
26 taken to accommodate the anticipated number of attendees. Nothing
27 in this subsection requires a public body to incur any costs to secure
28 a facility outside the control or jurisdiction of the public body or to
29 upgrade, improve or otherwise modify an existing facility to
30 accommodate the anticipated number of attendees.
31 3. Except in an emergency, written notice of all meetings must

3 the right of the public to request the supporting material pursuant to
4 subsection 7. The inability of the governing body, as a result of
5 technical problems with its website, to post supporting material
6 pursuant to this subsection shall not be deemed to be a violation of
7 the provisions of this chapter.
8 10. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 11, a public
9 body may provide the public notice, information or supporting

8 (b) After each item on the agenda on which action may be taken
9 is discussed by the public body, but before the public body takes
10 action on the item.
11 2. Regardless of whether a public body takes comments from
12 the general public pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) of subsection 1,
13 the public body must allow the general public to comment on any
14 matter that is not specifically included on the agenda as an action
15 item at some time before adjournment of the meeting. No action

20 subsection 3 of NRS 241.020.
21 3. The provisions of subsections 1 and 2 do not prohibit a

18 the public body provides the person with a web-based link and a
19 telephone number, in case of technical difficulties, that allows the
20 person in real time to attend and participate in the meeting. Nothing
21 in this paragraph requires a public body to provide a person with
22 technical support to address the person’s individual hardware,
23 software or other technical issues.
24 2. If all members of a public body:
25 (a) Are required to be elected officials, the public body shall not
26 conduct a meeting by means of a remote technology system without
27 a physical location designated for the meeting where members of
28 the public are permitted to attend and participate.
