AN ACT relating to emergency response; creating the Account for

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires: (1) the board of trustees of each school district and the
2 governing body of each charter school and private school to establish a
3 development committee to develop a plan to be used by the schools in the district or
4 the charter school or private school in responding to a crisis, emergency or suicide;
5 and (2) such a development committee to annually review and, as appropriate,
6 update the plan. (NRS 388.241, 388.245, 394.1685, 394.1688) Existing law creates
7 the Division of Emergency Management within the Office of the Military and
8 requires the Chief of the Division to carry out the program for emergency
9 management in this State. (NRS 414.040) Section 1 of this bill creates the Account
10 for the Nevada School Safety Data Grant Program within the Division to award
11 grants to law enforcement agencies in this State to procure school mapping data for
12 public schools located in the county in which the jurisdiction of the law
13 enforcement agency is located. Section 1: (1) authorizes a law enforcement agency
14 to apply for grants from the Program; (2) requires any grant money awarded from
15 the Program to be used for purposes of providing school mapping data by

20 to comply with certain requirements; and (5) requires the Division to adopt
21 regulations to carry out the provisions of the Program. Sections 1 and 1.1 of this
22 bill prohibit the disclosure of school mapping data produced using a grant from the
23 Account except to employees of the school district, a public safety agency or the
24 Division.
25 Sections 1.3 and 1.7 of this bill authorize the board of trustees of a school
26 district or the governing body of a charter school or private school to provide for
27 the installation at the schools under the management of the board of trustees or the
28 governing body of a secure, exterior master key box meeting certain requirements.
29 Sections 1.3 and 1.7 require the board of trustees or the governing body to consult
30 with public safety agencies to determine the location to install the master key box.
31 Sections 1.5 and 1.9 of this bill make certain existing definitions relating to
32 emergency responses in schools applicable to sections 1.3 and 1.7.
