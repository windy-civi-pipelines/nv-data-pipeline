PREFILED JANUARY 29, 2025

SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to the Judicial
Department of the State Government. (BDR 1-857)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to the Judicial Department of the State
Government; revising provisions relating to the
deliberative sessions of the Commission on Judicial
Discipline; revising the qualifications for district judges;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, the Commission on Judicial Discipline has exclusive
2 jurisdiction over the public censure, removal, involuntary retirement and other
3 discipline of judges. (NRS 1.440) Existing law requires that all deliberative
4 sessions of the Commission remain private and any minutes of such sessions
5 remain confidential. (NRS 1.4687) Section 1 of this bill instead requires the
6 Commission to make any minutes of such sessions accessible to the public while
7 maintaining the privacy of the deliberative sessions themselves. Section 3 of this
8 bill makes a conforming change to reflect that the minutes of a deliberative session
9 of the Commission are no longer confidential.
10 Existing law prescribes the qualifications for district judges. Among other
11 requirements, existing law provides that a district judge or candidate for district
12 judge must have been an attorney licensed and admitted to practice law in this State
13 or any other state for a total of not less than 10 years, at least 2 years of which must
14 have been in this State. (NRS 3.060) Section 2 of this bill revises the qualifications
15 for district judges or candidates for district judge to require any such person to have
16 acted as trial counsel in at least 10 trials in a district court of this State. Section 4 of
17 this bill provides that the additional qualifications prescribed by section 2 do not
18 abrogate or affect the current term of office of any district judge who is serving in
19 that office on the effective date of this bill.

A.B. 141
ASSEMBLY BILL NO. 141–ASSEMBLYMEMBER NGUYEN
PREFILED JANUARY 29, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Judiciary
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to the Judicial
Department of the State Government. (BDR 1-857)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to the Judicial Department of the State
Government; revising provisions relating to the
deliberative sessions of the Commission on Judicial
Discipline; revising the qualifications for district judges;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, the Commission on Judicial Discipline has exclusive
2 jurisdiction over the public censure, removal, involuntary retirement and other
3 discipline of judges. (NRS 1.440) Existing law requires that all deliberative
4 sessions of the Commission remain private and any minutes of such sessions
5 remain confidential. (NRS 1.4687) Section 1 of this bill instead requires the
6 Commission to make any minutes of such sessions accessible to the public while
7 maintaining the privacy of the deliberative sessions themselves. Section 3 of this
8 bill makes a conforming change to reflect that the minutes of a deliberative session
9 of the Commission are no longer confidential.
10 Existing law prescribes the qualifications for district judges. Among other
11 requirements, existing law provides that a district judge or candidate for district
12 judge must have been an attorney licensed and admitted to practice law in this State
13 or any other state for a total of not less than 10 years, at least 2 years of which must
14 have been in this State. (NRS 3.060) Section 2 of this bill revises the qualifications
15 for district judges or candidates for district judge to require any such person to have
16 acted as trial counsel in at least 10 trials in a district court of this State. Section 4 of
17 this bill provides that the additional qualifications prescribed by section 2 do not
18 abrogate or affect the current term of office of any district judge who is serving in
19 that office on the effective date of this bill.

11 711.600, sections 35, 38 and 41 of chapter 478, Statutes of Nevada
12 2011 and section 2 of chapter 391, Statutes of Nevada 2013 and

21 public. This section does not supersede or in any manner affect the

24 record which is copyrighted pursuant to federal law.
25 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record

28 public book or record shall not deny a request made pursuant to

40 means of an electronic medium if:
41 (a) The public record:
42 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
43 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
44 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by

12 request, prepare the copy of the public record and shall not require
