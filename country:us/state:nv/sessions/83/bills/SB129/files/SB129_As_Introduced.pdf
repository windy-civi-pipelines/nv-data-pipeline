EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to professions; requiring certain regulatory bodies
to issue an occupational or professional license by
endorsement under certain circumstances; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the regulation of certain occupations and professions
2 in this State. (Title 54 of NRS) Existing law further: (1) requires a regulatory body
3 to adopt regulations providing for the issuance of a license by endorsement to
4 engage in an occupation or profession in this State to certain natural persons; and
5 (2) sets forth certain minimum requirements for obtaining a license by
6 endorsement. (NRS 622.530) Section 1 of this bill provides instead that a
7 regulatory body is required to issue a license by endorsement to engage in an
8 occupation or profession in this State to certain applicants without the regulatory
9 body having to adopt regulations. Section 1 also revises the requirements for a
10 person to obtain such a license by endorsement to require that, in addition to certain
11 existing requirements, the person: (1) is a resident of this State; (2) has held for at
12 least 1 year a corresponding valid and unrestricted license in good standing to
13 engage in that occupation or profession in the District of Columbia or any state or
14 territory of the United States; (3) has satisfied the minimum educational,
15 examination and experience requirements for such license; and (4) has not
16 voluntarily surrendered any license to engage in the occupation or profession while
17 under investigation by the corresponding regulatory authority in the other
18 jurisdiction. Section 1 also specifies that it is an alternative to any specific statute
19 relating to the issuance of a license by endorsement by a regulatory body.
20 Section 2 of this bill provides that certain regulations adopted by a regulatory
21 body pursuant to existing law relating to the licensure by endorsement are void and
22 must not be given effect to the extent of conflict with section 1.
