AN ACT relating to education; eliminating the requirement that
pupils take a college and career readiness assessment
selected by the State Board of Education to graduate from
high school with a standard high school diploma; revising
various provisions to reflect the elimination of such a
requirement; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the State Board of Education to adopt regulations
2 requiring a pupil enrolled in grade 11 to take a college and career readiness
3 assessment to receive a standard high school diploma. (NRS 390.600) Under
4 existing law, the State Board is required to select such an assessment, and the
5 Department of Education is required to develop an informational pamphlet
6 concerning the assessment. (NRS 390.610, 390.620) Section 33 of this bill
7 eliminates the requirement for a pupil to take a college and career readiness
8 assessment to receive a standard high school diploma. Section 37 of this bill
9 repeals the requirement that the: (1) State Board select a college and career
10 readiness assessment; and (2) Department develop an informational pamphlet
11 concerning the assessment. Section 30 of this bill makes a conforming change to
12 remove an internal reference to one of the sections that is repealed by section 37.
13 Existing law requires the inclusion of information concerning the college and
14 career readiness assessment in certain plans and reports. (NRS 385.112, 385A.200,
15 385A.280, 385A.410, 385A.480, 385A.490, 385A.610, 385A.620, 385A.730,
16 388G.120) Sections 1-3, 5-7, 9-11 and 20 of this bill eliminate the requirement to
17 include information concerning the college and career readiness assessment in such
18 plans and reports.
19 Existing law requires that a pupil, the parent or legal guardian of a pupil and the
20 public be provided with certain information concerning the college and career
21 readiness assessment. (NRS 388.205, 388.208, 390.015) Sections 12, 13 and 22 of
22 this bill eliminate the requirement for certain persons to provide such information.

23 Existing law provides for the college and career readiness assessment to be
24 administered to pupils of charter schools, empowerment schools and pupils in a
25 program of distance education. (NRS 388.874, 388A.366, 388G.210) Sections 16,
26 17 and 21 of this bill eliminate requirements related to providing the assessment to
27 such pupils.
28 Existing law authorizes the board of trustees of a school district or the
29 governing body of a charter school to adopt a policy to provide individual
30 graduation plans to certain pupils including, without limitation, pupils who
31 performed poorly on the college and career readiness assessment. (NRS 388.227)
32 Section 14 of this bill eliminates the authority to provide for an individual
33 graduation plan on the basis of a pupil’s performance on the assessment.
34 Existing law excludes the college and career readiness assessment from the
35 applicability of certain provisions governing the security of data concerning pupils.
36 (NRS 388.283) Section 15 eliminates this provision in conformance with the
37 elimination of the requirement for a pupil to take the assessment to receive a
38 standard high school diploma.
39 Existing law requires the Department of Education and the board of trustees of
40 each school district to adopt a plan setting forth procedures to ensure the security of
41 the criterion-referenced examinations and the college and career readiness
42 assessment and provides other provisions governing the administration and security
43 of such examinations and assessments, including provisions authorizing the
44 Department to enter into a contract for the scoring of such examinations and
45 assessments and penalties for personnel who breach the security of such
46 examinations and assessments. (NRS 390.250-390.430, 390.840, 391.330, 391.750)
47 Sections 23-29 and 31-36 of this bill revise these provisions to remove references
48 to the college and career readiness assessment, thereby limiting the applicability of
49 these provisions to just the criterion-referenced examinations.
50 Sections 4, 8, 18 and 19 of this bill make conforming changes to reflect the
51 renumbering of certain provisions in section 33.

A.B. 401
ASSEMBLY BILL NO. 401–ASSEMBLYMEMBER ANDERSON
MARCH 11, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Education
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to education.
(BDR 34-894)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; eliminating the requirement that
pupils take a college and career readiness assessment
selected by the State Board of Education to graduate from
high school with a standard high school diploma; revising
various provisions to reflect the elimination of such a
requirement; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the State Board of Education to adopt regulations
2 requiring a pupil enrolled in grade 11 to take a college and career readiness
3 assessment to receive a standard high school diploma. (NRS 390.600) Under
4 existing law, the State Board is required to select such an assessment, and the
5 Department of Education is required to develop an informational pamphlet
6 concerning the assessment. (NRS 390.610, 390.620) Section 33 of this bill
7 eliminates the requirement for a pupil to take a college and career readiness
8 assessment to receive a standard high school diploma. Section 37 of this bill
9 repeals the requirement that the: (1) State Board select a college and career
10 readiness assessment; and (2) Department develop an informational pamphlet
11 concerning the assessment. Section 30 of this bill makes a conforming change to
12 remove an internal reference to one of the sections that is repealed by section 37.
13 Existing law requires the inclusion of information concerning the college and
14 career readiness assessment in certain plans and reports. (NRS 385.112, 385A.200,
15 385A.280, 385A.410, 385A.480, 385A.490, 385A.610, 385A.620, 385A.730,
16 388G.120) Sections 1-3, 5-7, 9-11 and 20 of this bill eliminate the requirement to
17 include information concerning the college and career readiness assessment in such
18 plans and reports.
19 Existing law requires that a pupil, the parent or legal guardian of a pupil and the
20 public be provided with certain information concerning the college and career
21 readiness assessment. (NRS 388.205, 388.208, 390.015) Sections 12, 13 and 22 of
22 this bill eliminate the requirement for certain persons to provide such information.
-
*AB401*

– 2 –
23 Existing law provides for the college and career readiness assessment to be
24 administered to pupils of charter schools, empowerment schools and pupils in a
25 program of distance education. (NRS 388.874, 388A.366, 388G.210) Sections 16,
26 17 and 21 of this bill eliminate requirements related to providing the assessment to
27 such pupils.
28 Existing law authorizes the board of trustees of a school district or the
29 governing body of a charter school to adopt a policy to provide individual
30 graduation plans to certain pupils including, without limitation, pupils who
31 performed poorly on the college and career readiness assessment. (NRS 388.227)
32 Section 14 of this bill eliminates the authority to provide for an individual
33 graduation plan on the basis of a pupil’s performance on the assessment.
34 Existing law excludes the college and career readiness assessment from the
35 applicability of certain provisions governing the security of data concerning pupils.
36 (NRS 388.283) Section 15 eliminates this provision in conformance with the
37 elimination of the requirement for a pupil to take the assessment to receive a
38 standard high school diploma.
39 Existing law requires the Department of Education and the board of trustees of
40 each school district to adopt a plan setting forth procedures to ensure the security of
41 the criterion-referenced examinations and the college and career readiness
42 assessment and provides other provisions governing the administration and security
43 of such examinations and assessments, including provisions authorizing the
44 Department to enter into a contract for the scoring of such examinations and
45 assessments and penalties for personnel who breach the security of such
46 examinations and assessments. (NRS 390.250-390.430, 390.840, 391.330, 391.750)
47 Sections 23-29 and 31-36 of this bill revise these provisions to remove references
48 to the college and career readiness assessment, thereby limiting the applicability of
49 these provisions to just the criterion-referenced examinations.
50 Sections 4, 8, 18 and 19 of this bill make conforming changes to reflect the
51 renumbering of certain provisions in section 33.

SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
