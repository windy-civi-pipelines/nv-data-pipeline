Assembly Bill No. 1–Committee
on Government Affairs
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to public lands; declaring void certain regulations
relating to the development and disposal of land in the Fort
Mohave Valley; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Senate Bill No. 301 of the 2007 Legislative Session (S.B. 301) transferred the
power and responsibility of administering the Fort Mohave Valley Development
Law from the Colorado River Commission of Nevada to the Board of County
Commissioners of Clark County. (Section 5 of Senate Bill No. 301, chapter 427,
Statutes of Nevada 2007, at page 2003) Before S.B. 301 transferred this power and
responsibility to the Board of County Commissioners of Clark County, the
Colorado River Commission of Nevada had the authority to adopt regulations
governing procedures for the disposal of land in the Fort Mohave Valley. (Section 4
of Assembly Bill No. 494, chapter 822, Statutes of Nevada 1987, at page 2315)
Under this authority, the Colorado River Commission of Nevada adopted
regulations governing the development and disposal of land in the Fort Mohave
Valley. (NAC 321.100-321.230) This bill voids those regulations and requires the
Legislative Counsel to remove the regulations from the Nevada Administrative
Code.
