Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth provisions governing parentage and the establishment of
2 parent and child relationships. (Chapter 126 of NRS) Sections 28-91 of this bill
3 generally replace such provisions with provisions modeled after those of the
4 Uniform Parentage Act (hereinafter “UPA”), adopted by the Uniform Law
5 Commission in 2017. Sections 4-26 of this bill define terms for the purposes of
6 chapter 126 of NRS that are modeled after the definitions of the terms used in the
7 UPA.
8 Existing law provides the manners in which the legal relationship of a mother
9 and child can be established, including: (1) except in the case of a gestational
10 agreement, proof that a woman gave birth to a child; (2) an adjudication that a
11 woman is the mother of a child; (3) proof that a woman has adopted a child; (4) an
12 unrebutted presumption of a woman’s maternity; (5) the consent of a woman to
13 assisted reproduction that resulted in the birth of a child; or (6) an adjudication
14 confirming a woman as a parent of a child born to a gestational carrier. (NRS
15 126.041) Existing law also provides the manners in which the legal relationship of
16 a father and child can be established, including: (1) an adjudication that a man is
17 the father of a child; (2) proof that a man has adopted a child; (3) the consent of a
18 man to assisted reproduction that resulted in the birth of a child; (4) an adjudication
19 confirming a man as a parent of a child born to a gestational carrier; (5) a
20 presumption of paternity that arises if a man was married to or cohabiting with the
21 natural mother of a child or resides with and holds out a child as his natural child;
22 (6) genetic testing establishing a man as the father of a child; or (7) a voluntary
23 acknowledgment of paternity by a man. (NRS 126.041, 126.051, 126.053) Section
24 34 of this bill uses the gender-neutral language of the UPA to set forth the
25 circumstances in which a parent and child relationship is established between a
26 person and a child. Similarly, section 37 of this bill uses the gender-neutral
27 language of the UPA to establish the circumstances in which a person is presumed
28 to be a parent of a child.
29 Sections 38-51 of this bill establish provisions modeled after those of the UPA
30 relating to the voluntary acknowledgment or voluntary denial of parentage by
31 certain persons, including provisions relating to the requirements for, rescission of
32 and challenge to an acknowledgment of parentage or denial of parentage. Section
33 42 of this bill provides that, unless an acknowledgment of parentage or denial of
34 parentage is rescinded or challenged, such an acknowledgment of parentage or
35 denial of parentage that meets all requirements of law and is filed with the State
36 Registrar of Vital Statistics is equivalent to an adjudication of the parentage of a
37 child or the nonparentage of a person, respectively. Section 43 of this bill prohibits
38 the State Registrar of Vital Statistics from charging a fee for filing an
39 acknowledgment of parentage or denial of parentage, and section 51 of this bill
40 authorizes the State Board of Health to adopt any necessary regulations relating to
41 an acknowledgment of parentage or denial of parentage.
42 Existing law provides that in an action to determine paternity, a court is
43 authorized or required, depending on the circumstances, to order genetic testing of
44 a mother, child, alleged father or any other person. (NRS 126.121) Sections 52-68
45 of this bill establish various provisions modeled after those of the UPA concerning
46 genetic testing, including: (1) the limitation on the use of genetic testing; (2) the
47 authority to order, facilitate or deny genetic testing; (3) the requirements of genetic
48 testing; (4) reports and costs of genetic testing; (5) additional genetic testing when a
49 result is contested; (6) genetic testing when a specimen is not available from an
50 alleged genetic parent; and (7) genetic testing of a deceased person or identical
51 sibling. Section 68 of this bill provides that a person commits a misdemeanor if,
52 without proper authority, he or she intentionally releases an identifiable specimen
53 of another person collected for genetic testing for a purpose not relevant to a
54 proceeding regarding parentage.

55 Existing law establishes various provisions relating to an action to determine
56 paternity or maternity. (NRS 126.071-126.231) Sections 69-89 of this bill replace
57 several of those provisions with provisions modeled after those of the UPA
58 governing proceedings to adjudicate parentage. Existing law provides that if an
59 action to determine paternity is brought before the birth of a child, all proceedings
60 are generally required to be stayed until after the birth of the child. (NRS 126.071)
61 Section 84 of this bill instead authorizes a proceeding to adjudicate parentage to be
62 commenced and an order or judgment to be entered before the birth of a child, but
63 requires enforcement of the order or judgment to be stayed until after the birth of
64 the child.
65 Existing law does not bar an action to determine paternity until 3 years after a
66 child reaches the age of majority. (NRS 126.081) Sections 75 and 76 of this bill
67 instead provide that a proceeding to determine whether an alleged genetic parent or
68 presumed parent, respectively, is a parent of a child may be commenced after the
69 child becomes an adult if the child initiates the proceeding.
70 Existing law requires that an informal hearing be held after an action to
71 determine paternity has been brought and further requires a court to attempt to
72 resolve the issues raised in the action during the pretrial hearing. (NRS 126.111)
73 Section 136 of this bill repeals the provisions relating to such a pretrial hearing, as
74 the UPA does not require any such pretrial hearing to be conducted.
75 Section 77 of this bill authorizes a person who claims to be a de facto parent of
76 a child to commence a proceeding to establish parentage of the child if the child is
77 alive and less than 18 years of age. Section 77 provides that a person who claims to
78 be a de facto parent of a child must be adjudicated as a parent of the child if there is
79 only one other person who is a parent or has a claim to parentage of the child and
80 the person who claims to be a de facto parent can demonstrate certain facts by clear
81 and convincing evidence. Section 81 of this bill authorizes a court to adjudicate a
82 child to have more than two parents if the court finds that failure to recognize more
83 than two parents would be detrimental to the child.
84 Existing law establishes provisions concerning assisted reproduction and
85 gestational surrogacy. (NRS 126.500-126.810) This bill establishes only certain
86 provisions modeled after those of the UPA relating to such matters. Section 92 of
87 this bill establishes provisions relating to the parental status of certain persons who
88 die before a child is conceived by assisted reproduction. Section 93 of this bill
89 authorizes a party to a gestational agreement to terminate the agreement at any time
90 before an embryo transfer or, if an embryo transfer does not result in pregnancy, at
91 any time before a subsequent embryo transfer.
92 Existing law requires that a gestational agreement provide for the express
93 written agreement of the gestational carrier to undergo embryo or gamete transfer
94 and attempt to carry and give birth to any resulting child. (NRS 126.750) Section
95 107 of this bill requires that a gestational agreement also provide for the express
96 written agreement of the gestational carrier and any legal spouse or domestic
97 partner of the gestational carrier to acknowledge that each intended parent is the
98 legal and physical custodian of any resulting child. Section 107 also specifies that a
99 gestational carrier has the right to make all health and welfare decisions regarding
100 the gestational carrier and the pregnancy of the gestational carrier, including
101 whether to: (1) consent to a cesarean section or the transfer of multiple embryos;
102 (2) use the services of a health care practitioner chosen by the gestational carrier;
103 (3) terminate or continue the pregnancy; and (4) reduce or retain the number of
104 fetuses or embryos carried by the gestational carrier. Section 107 further provides
105 that any provision in a gestational agreement that contradicts such a right is void
106 and unenforceable.
107 Existing law provides that the subsequent marriage or domestic partnership of a
108 gestational carrier after the execution of a gestational agreement does not affect the
109 validity of the agreement. (NRS 126.770) Section 108 of this bill provides that the
-
*AB371_R2*
– 4 –
110 subsequent marriage, domestic partnership or divorce of any party to a gestational
111 agreement does not affect the validity of the agreement unless the agreement
112 expressly provides otherwise.
113 Existing law provides that if a gestational carrier breaches a gestational
114 agreement, a specific performance remedy that would require the gestational carrier
115 to be impregnated is prohibited. (NRS 126.780) Section 109 of this bill instead
116 provides that specific performance is not an available remedy with regard to a
117 gestational agreement except to enforce any provision in the agreement that is
118 necessary to enable the intended parents to exercise the full rights of parentage
119 immediately upon the birth of the child, if the intended parents are being prevented
120 from exercising such rights.
121 Sections 98-106 of this bill make various other changes to the provisions of
122 existing law concerning assisted reproduction and gestational surrogacy.
123 Section 136 repeals provisions of existing law that are not necessary because of
124 the establishment of the provisions modeled after those of the UPA in sections
125 28-91.
126 Sections 1, 94-97, 110-133 and 136 of this bill make conforming changes to
127 reflect the revisions made to existing law because of the establishment of the
128 provisions modeled after those of the UPA in sections 28-91 and the repeal of
129 unnecessary provisions in section 136.

26 parent is attested by an electronic notary public or other notarial
27 officer or signed by at least one witness; and
28 3. The presumed parent or alleged genetic parent has not
29 previously:
30 (a) Completed a valid acknowledgment of parentage for the
31 same child, unless the previous acknowledgment was rescinded
32 under section 45 of this act or challenged successfully under
33 section 46 of this act; or
34 (b) Been adjudicated to be a parent of the child.
35 Sec. 41. 1. An acknowledgment of parentage and a denial
36 of parentage may be contained in a single document or may be in
37 counterparts and may be filed with the State Registrar of Vital
38 Statistics separately or simultaneously. If filing of the
39 acknowledgment and denial both are required under sections 28 to
40 91, inclusive, of this act, neither is effective until both are filed.
41 2. An acknowledgment of parentage or denial of parentage
42 may only be signed after the birth of the child.

1 4. An acknowledgment of parentage or denial of parentage
2 signed by a person who is a minor is valid if the acknowledgment
3 complies with sections 28 to 91, inclusive, of this act.
4 Sec. 42. 1. Except as otherwise provided in sections 45 and
5 46 of this act, an acknowledgment of parentage that complies with
6 sections 38 to 51, inclusive, of this act and is filed with the State
7 Registrar of Vital Statistics is equivalent to an adjudication of
8 parentage of the child and confers on the acknowledged parent all
9 rights and duties of a parent.
10 2. Except as otherwise provided in sections 45 and 46 of this
11 act, a denial of parentage by a presumed parent or alleged genetic
12 parent which complies with sections 38 to 51, inclusive, of this act
13 and is filed with the State Registrar of Vital Statistics with an
14 acknowledgment of parentage that complies with sections 38 to 51,
15 inclusive, of this act is equivalent to an adjudication of the
16 nonparentage of the presumed parent or alleged genetic parent
17 who signed the denial and discharges the presumed parent or
18 alleged genetic parent who signed the denial from all rights and
19 duties of a parent.
20 Sec. 43. The State Registrar of Vital Statistics may not
21 charge a fee for filing an acknowledgment of parentage or denial
22 of parentage.
23 Sec. 44. A court conducting a judicial proceeding or an
24 administrative agency conducting an administrative proceeding is
25 not required or permitted to ratify an unchallenged
26 acknowledgment of parentage. A court may determine that a
27 person who signed an acknowledgment of parentage is a parent in
28 a later proceeding based on other grounds.
29 Sec. 45. 1. A signatory may rescind an acknowledgment of
30 parentage or denial of parentage by filing with the State Registrar
31 of Vital Statistics a rescission in a signed record which is attested
32 by an electronic notary public or notarial officer or signed by at
33 least one witness, before the earlier of:
34 (a) Sixty days after the effective date under section 41 of this
35 act of the acknowledgment or denial; or
36 (b) The date of the first hearing before a court in a proceeding,
37 to which the signatory is a party, to adjudicate an issue relating to
38 the child, including a proceeding that establishes support.
39 2. If an acknowledgment of parentage is rescinded under
40 subsection 1, an associated denial of parentage is invalid, and the
41 State Registrar of Vital Statistics shall notify the person who gave
42 birth to the child and the person who signed a denial of parentage
43 of the child that the acknowledgment has been rescinded. Failure
44 to give the notice required by this subsection does not affect the
45 validity of the rescission.

1 Sec. 46. 1. After the period for rescission under section 45
2 of this act expires, but not later than 2 years after the effective date
3 under section 41 of this act of an acknowledgment of parentage or
4 denial of parentage, a signatory of the acknowledgment or denial
5 may commence a proceeding to challenge the acknowledgment or
6 denial only on the basis of fraud, duress or material mistake of
7 fact.

12 parentage and any related denial of parentage must be made a
13 party to a proceeding to challenge the acknowledgment or denial.
14 2. By signing an acknowledgment of parentage or denial of
15 parentage, a signatory submits to personal jurisdiction in this
16 State in a proceeding to challenge the acknowledgment or denial,

18 State Registrar of Vital Statistics.
19 3. The court may not suspend the legal responsibilities
20 arising from an acknowledgment of parentage, including the duty
21 to pay child support, during the pendency of a proceeding to
22 challenge the acknowledgment or a related denial of parentage,
23 unless the party challenging the acknowledgment or denial shows
24 good cause.
25 4. A party challenging an acknowledgment of parentage or
26 denial of parentage has the burden of proof.
27 5. If the court determines that a party has satisfied the burden
28 of proof under subsection 4, the court shall order the State
29 Registrar of Vital Statistics to amend the birth record of the child
30 to reflect the legal parentage of the child.
31 6. A proceeding to challenge an acknowledgment of
32 parentage or denial of parentage must be conducted under
33 sections 69 to 89, inclusive, of this act.
34 Sec. 48. The court shall give full faith and credit to an
35 acknowledgment of parentage or denial of parentage effective in
36 another state if the acknowledgment or denial was in a signed
37 record and otherwise complies with the law of the other state.
38 Sec. 49. A valid acknowledgment of parentage or denial of
39 parentage is not affected by a later modification of the declaration
40 developed by the State Board of Health pursuant to NRS 440.285.

10 Sec. 53. “Combined relationship index” means the product
11 of all tested relationship indices.
12 Sec. 54. “Ethnic or racial group” means, for the purpose of
13 genetic testing, a recognized group that a person identifies as the
14 person’s ancestry or part of the ancestry or that is identified by
15 other information.
16 Sec. 55. “Hypothesized genetic relationship” means an
17 asserted genetic relationship between a person and a child.
18 Sec. 56. “Probability of parentage” means, for the ethnic or
19 racial group to which a person alleged to be a parent belongs, the
20 probability that a hypothesized genetic relationship is supported,
21 compared to the probability that a genetic relationship is
22 supported between the child and a random person of the ethnic or
23 racial group used in the hypothesized genetic relationship,
24 expressed as a percentage incorporating the combined
25 relationship index and a prior probability.
26 Sec. 57. “Relationship index” means a likelihood ratio that
27 compares the probability of a genetic marker given a hypothesized
28 genetic relationship and the probability of the genetic marker
29 given a genetic relationship between the child and a random
30 person of the ethnic or racial group used in the hypothesized
31 genetic relationship.
32 Sec. 58. 1. Sections 52 to 68, inclusive, of this act govern
33 genetic testing of a person in a proceeding to adjudicate
34 parentage, whether the person:

45 under sections 28 to 91, inclusive, of this act to determine
-
*AB371_R2*
– 14 –
1 parentage, the court shall order the child and any other person to
2 submit to genetic testing if a request for testing is supported by the
3 sworn statement of a party:
4 (a) Alleging a reasonable possibility that the person is the
5 child’s genetic parent; or
6 (b) Denying genetic parentage of the child and stating facts
7 establishing a reasonable possibility that the person is not a
8 genetic parent.
9 2. A child support agency may facilitate genetic testing only if
10 there is no acknowledged or adjudicated parent of a child other
11 than the person who gave birth to the child.
12 3. The court may not order, and a child support agency may
13 not facilitate, in utero genetic testing.
14 4. If two or more persons are subject to court-ordered genetic
15 testing, the court may order that testing be completed concurrently
16 or sequentially.
17 5. Genetic testing of a person who gave birth to a child is not
18 a condition precedent to testing of the child and a person whose
19 genetic parentage of the child is being determined. If the person
20 who gave birth to the child is unavailable or declines to submit to
21 genetic testing, the court may order genetic testing of the child and
22 each person whose genetic parentage of the child is being
23 adjudicated.
24 6. In a proceeding to adjudicate the parentage of a child
25 having a presumed parent or a person who claims to be a parent
26 under section 77 of this act, or to challenge an acknowledgment of
27 parentage, the court may deny a motion for genetic testing of the
28 child and any other person after considering the factors in
29 subsections 1 and 2 of section 81 of this act.
30 7. If a person requesting genetic testing is barred under
31 sections 69 to 89, inclusive, of this act from establishing the
32 person’s parentage, the court shall deny the request for genetic
33 testing.
34 8. An order under this section for genetic testing is
35 enforceable by contempt.
36 Sec. 60. 1. Genetic testing must be of a type reasonably
37 relied on by experts in the field of genetic testing and performed in
38 a testing laboratory accredited by:
39 (a) The AABB, formerly known as the American Association
40 of Blood Banks, or a successor to its functions; or
41 (b) An accrediting body designated by the Secretary of the
42 United States Department of Health and Human Services.
43 2. A specimen used in genetic testing may consist of a sample
44 or a combination of samples of blood, buccal cells, bone, hair or
45 other body tissue or fluid. The specimen used in the testing need
-
*AB371_R2*
– 15 –
1 not be of the same kind for each person undergoing genetic
2 testing.
3 3. Based on the ethnic or racial group of a person
4 undergoing genetic testing, a testing laboratory shall determine
5 the databases from which to select frequencies for use in
6 calculating a relationship index. If a person or a child support
7 agency objects to the laboratory’s choice, the following rules
8 apply:
9 (a) Not later than 30 days after receipt of the report of the test,
10 the objecting person or child support agency may request the court
11 to require the laboratory to recalculate the relationship index
12 using an ethnic or racial group different from that used by the
13 laboratory.
14 (b) The person or the child support agency objecting to the
15 laboratory’s choice under this subsection shall:
16 (1) If the requested frequencies are not available to the
17 laboratory for the ethnic or racial group requested, provide the
18 requested frequencies compiled in a manner recognized by
19 accrediting bodies; or
20 (2) Engage another laboratory to perform the calculations.
21 (c) The laboratory may use its own statistical estimate if there
22 is a question which ethnic or racial group is appropriate. The
23 laboratory shall calculate the frequencies using statistics, if
24 available, for any other ethnic or racial group requested.
25 4. If, after recalculation of the relationship index under
26 subsection 3 using a different ethnic or racial group, genetic
27 testing under section 62 of this act does not identify a person as a
28 genetic parent of a child, the court may require a person who has
29 been tested to submit to additional genetic testing to identify a
30 genetic parent.
31 Sec. 61. 1. A report of genetic testing must be in a record
32 and signed under penalty of perjury by a designee of the testing
33 laboratory. A report complying with the requirements of sections
34 52 to 68, inclusive, of this act is self-authenticating.
35 2. Documentation from a testing laboratory of the following
36 information is sufficient to establish a reliable chain of custody
37 and allow the results of genetic testing to be admissible without
38 testimony:
39 (a) The name and photograph of each person whose specimen
40 has been taken;
41 (b) The name of the person who collected each specimen;
42 (c) The place and date each specimen was collected;
43 (d) The name of the person who received each specimen in the
44 testing laboratory; and
45 (e) The date each specimen was received.

1 Sec. 62. 1. Subject to a challenge under subsection 2, a
2 person is identified under sections 28 to 91, inclusive, of this act as
3 a genetic parent of a child if genetic testing complies with sections
4 52 to 68, inclusive, of this act and the results of the testing
5 disclose:
6 (a) The person has at least a 99 percent probability of
7 parentage, using a prior probability of 0.50, as calculated by using
8 the combined relationship index obtained in the testing; and
9 (b) A combined relationship index of at least 100 to 1.
10 2. A person identified under subsection 1 as a genetic parent
11 of the child may challenge the genetic testing results only by other
12 genetic testing satisfying the requirements of sections 52 to 68,
13 inclusive, of this act which:
14 (a) Excludes the person as a genetic parent of the child; or
15 (b) Identifies another person as a possible genetic parent of the
16 child other than:
17 (1) The person who gave birth to the child; or
18 (2) The person identified under subsection 1.
19 3. Except as otherwise provided in section 67 of this act, if
20 more than one person other than the person who gave birth to the
21 child is identified by genetic testing as a possible genetic parent of
22 the child, the court shall order each person to submit to further
23 genetic testing to identify a genetic parent.
24 Sec. 63. 1. Subject to assessment of fees under sections 69
25 to 89, inclusive, of this act, payment of the cost of initial genetic
26 testing must be made in advance:
27 (a) By the person who made the request for genetic testing;
28 (b) As agreed by the parties; or
29 (c) As ordered by the court.
30 2. If the cost of genetic testing is paid by a child support
31 agency, the agency may seek reimbursement from the genetic
32 parent whose parent and child relationship is established.
33 Sec. 64. The court shall order, or a child support agency may
34 facilitate, additional genetic testing on request of a person who
35 contests the result of the initial testing under section 62 of this act.
36 If initial genetic testing under section 62 of this act identified a
37 person as a genetic parent of the child, the court may not order,
38 and a child support agency may not facilitate, additional testing
39 unless the contesting person pays for the testing in advance.
40 Sec. 65. 1. Subject to subsection 2, if a genetic-testing
41 specimen is not available from an alleged genetic parent of a
42 child, a person seeking genetic testing demonstrates good cause
43 and the court finds that the circumstances are just, the court may
44 order any of the following persons to submit specimens for genetic
45 testing:
-
*AB371_R2*
– 17 –
1 (a) A parent of the alleged genetic parent;
2 (b) A sibling of the alleged genetic parent;
3 (c) Another child of the alleged genetic parent and the person
4 who gave birth to the other child; and
5 (d) Another relative of the alleged genetic parent necessary to
6 complete genetic testing.
7 2. To issue an order under this section, the court must find
8 that a need for genetic testing outweighs the legitimate interests of
9 the person sought to be tested.
10 Sec. 66. If a person seeking genetic testing demonstrates
11 good cause, the court may order genetic testing of a deceased
12 person.
13 Sec. 67. 1. If the court finds there is reason to believe that
14 an alleged genetic parent has an identical sibling and evidence
15 that the sibling may be a genetic parent of the child, the court may
16 order genetic testing of the sibling.
17 2. If more than one sibling is identified under section 62 of
18 this act as a genetic parent of the child, the court may rely on
19 nongenetic evidence to adjudicate which sibling is a genetic parent
20 of the child.
21 Sec. 68. 1. Release of a report of genetic testing for
22 parentage is controlled by law of this State other than sections 28
23 to 91, inclusive, of this act.
24 2. A person who intentionally releases an identifiable
25 specimen of another person collected for genetic testing under
26 sections 52 to 68, inclusive, of this act for a purpose not relevant to
27 a proceeding regarding parentage, without a court order or written
28 permission of the person who furnished the specimen, commits a
29 misdemeanor.
30 Sec. 69. 1. A proceeding may be commenced to adjudicate
31 the parentage of a child. Except as otherwise provided in sections
32 28 to 91, inclusive, of this act, the proceeding is governed by the
33 Nevada Rules of Civil Procedure.
34 2. A proceeding to adjudicate the parentage of a child born
35 under a gestational agreement is governed by NRS 126.500 to
36 126.810, inclusive, and sections 92 and 93 of this act.

14 8. An agency which provides child welfare services in a
15 proceeding pursuant to chapter 432B of NRS. As used in this
16 subsection, “agency which provides child welfare services” has the
17 meaning ascribed to it in NRS 432B.030.

29 2. A person entitled to notice under subsection 1 has a right
30 to intervene in the proceeding.
31 3. Lack of notice required by subsection 1 does not render a
32 judgment void. Lack of notice does not preclude a person entitled

36 of a child only if the court has personal jurisdiction over the
37 person.
38 2. A court of this State with jurisdiction to adjudicate
39 parentage may exercise personal jurisdiction over a nonresident if
40 the conditions prescribed in NRS 130.201 are satisfied.
41 3. Lack of jurisdiction over one person does not preclude the
42 court from making an adjudication of parentage binding on
43 another person.
44 Sec. 73. Venue for a proceeding to adjudicate parentage is in

15 report. The party shall cite specific grounds for exclusion.
16 3. A party that objects to the results of genetic testing may
17 call a genetic-testing expert to testify in person or by another
18 method approved by the court. Unless the court orders otherwise,
19 the party offering the testimony bears the expense for the expert
20 testifying.
21 4. Admissibility of a report of genetic testing is not affected by
22 whether the testing was performed:
23 (a) Voluntarily, under an order of the court or as a result of
24 the facilitation of a child support agency; or
25 (b) Before, on or after commencement of the proceeding.
26 Sec. 75. 1. A proceeding to determine whether an alleged
27 genetic parent who is not a presumed parent is a parent of a child
28 may be commenced:
29 (a) Before the child becomes an adult; or
30 (b) After the child becomes an adult, but only if the child
31 initiates the proceeding.
32 2. This subsection applies in a proceeding described in
33 subsection 1 if the person who gave birth to the child is the only
34 other person with a claim to parentage of the child. The court
35 shall adjudicate an alleged genetic parent to be a parent of the

37 (a) Is identified under section 62 of this act as a genetic parent
38 of the child and the identification is not successfully challenged
39 under section 62 of this act;
40 (b) Admits parentage in a pleading, when making an
41 appearance or during a hearing, the court accepts the admission
42 and the court determines the alleged genetic parent to be a parent
43 of the child;

45 facilitated by a child support agency, in which case the court may
-
*AB371_R2*
– 20 –
1 adjudicate the alleged genetic parent to be a parent of the child
2 even if the alleged genetic parent denies a genetic relationship
3 with the child;
4 (d) Is in default after service of process and the court
5 determines the alleged genetic parent to be a parent of the child;
6 or
7 (e) Is neither identified nor excluded as a genetic parent by
8 genetic testing and, based on other evidence, the court determines
9 the alleged genetic parent to be a parent of the child.
10 3. Subject to other limitations in sections 74 to 81, inclusive,
11 of this act, if in a proceeding involving an alleged genetic parent,
12 at least one other person in addition to the person who gave birth
13 to the child has a claim to parentage of the child, the court shall
14 adjudicate parentage under section 81 of this act.
15 Sec. 76. 1. A proceeding to determine whether a presumed
16 parent is a parent of a child may be commenced:
17 (a) Before the child becomes an adult; or
18 (b) After the child becomes an adult, but only if the child
19 initiates the proceeding.
20 2. A presumption of parentage under section 37 of this act
21 cannot be overcome after the child attains 2 years of age unless
22 the court determines:
23 (a) The presumed parent is not a genetic parent, never resided
24 with the child and never held out the child as the presumed
25 parent’s child; or
26 (b) The child has more than one presumed parent.
27 3. The following rules apply in a proceeding to adjudicate a
28 presumed parent’s parentage of a child if the person who gave
29 birth to the child is the only other person with a claim to parentage
30 of the child:
31 (a) If no party to the proceeding challenges the presumed
32 parent’s parentage of the child, the court shall adjudicate the
33 presumed parent to be a parent of the child.
34 (b) If the presumed parent is identified under section 62 of this
35 act as a genetic parent of the child and that identification is not
36 successfully challenged under section 62 of this act, the court
37 shall adjudicate the presumed parent to be a parent of the child.
38 (c) If the presumed parent is not identified under section 62 of
39 this act as a genetic parent of the child and the presumed parent
40 or the person who gave birth to the child challenges the presumed
41 parent’s parentage of the child, the court shall adjudicate the
42 parentage of the child in the best interest of the child based on the
43 factors under subsections 1 and 2 of section 81 of this act.
44 4. Subject to other limitations in sections 74 to 81, inclusive,
45 of this act, if in a proceeding to adjudicate a presumed parent’s
-
*AB371_R2*
– 21 –

29 preponderance of the evidence the requirements of paragraphs (a)
30 to (g), inclusive, of subsection 4. If the court holds a hearing
31 under this subsection, the hearing must be held on an expedited

11 child, if another person other than the person who gave birth to
12 the child is a parent under NRS 126.500 to 126.810, inclusive, and

40 3. The court may adjudicate a child to have more than two
41 parents under sections 28 to 91, inclusive, of this act if the court
42 finds that failure to recognize more than two parents would be
43 detrimental to the child. A finding of detriment to the child does
44 not require a finding of unfitness of any parent or person seeking
45 an adjudication of parentage. In determining detriment to the
-
*AB371_R2*
– 24 –
1 child, the court shall consider all relevant factors, including the
2 harm if the child is removed from a stable placement with a person
3 who has fulfilled the child’s physical needs and psychological

4 without a jury.
5 Sec. 87. The court may dismiss a proceeding under sections
6 28 to 91, inclusive, of this act for want of prosecution only without

15 litem in the proceeding.
16 3. In a proceeding for divorce, dissolution, annulment,

18 maintenance, the court is deemed to have made an adjudication of
19 parentage of a child if the court acts under circumstances that
20 satisfy the jurisdiction requirements of NRS 130.201 and the final
21 order:
22 (a) Expressly identifies the child as a “child of the marriage”
23 or “issue of the marriage” or includes similar words indicating
24 that both spouses are parents of the child; or
25 (b) Provides for support of the child by a spouse or domestic
26 partner unless that spouse’s or domestic partner’s parentage of

29 of this act, a determination of parentage may be asserted as a
30 defense in a subsequent proceeding seeking to adjudicate

2 conceived by assisted reproduction dies during the period between
3 the transfer of a gamete or embryo and the birth of the child, the

7 2. If a person who consented in a record to assisted

26 unless:
27 (a) The agreement provides otherwise; and
28 (b) The transfer of a gamete or embryo occurs not later than
29 36 months after the death of the intended parent or birth of the
30 child occurs not later than 45 months after the death of the

36 terminate the agreement at any time before a subsequent embryo
37 transfer.
38 2. Unless a gestational agreement provides otherwise, on
39 termination of the agreement under subsection 1, the parties are
40 released from the agreement, except that each intended parent
41 remains responsible for expenses that are reimbursable under the
42 agreement and incurred by the gestational carrier through the
43 date of termination.

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth provisions governing parentage and the establishment of
2 parent and child relationships. (Chapter 126 of NRS) Sections 28-91 of this bill
3 generally replace such provisions with provisions modeled after those of the
4 Uniform Parentage Act (hereinafter “UPA”), adopted by the Uniform Law
5 Commission in 2017. Sections 4-26 of this bill define terms for the purposes of
6 chapter 126 of NRS that are modeled after the definitions of the terms used in the
7 UPA.
8 Existing law provides the manners in which the legal relationship of a mother
9 and child can be established, including: (1) except in the case of a gestational
10 agreement, proof that a woman gave birth to a child; (2) an adjudication that a
11 woman is the mother of a child; (3) proof that a woman has adopted a child; (4) an
12 unrebutted presumption of a woman’s maternity; (5) the consent of a woman to
13 assisted reproduction that resulted in the birth of a child; or (6) an adjudication
14 confirming a woman as a parent of a child born to a gestational carrier. (NRS
15 126.041) Existing law also provides the manners in which the legal relationship of
16 a father and child can be established, including: (1) an adjudication that a man is
17 the father of a child; (2) proof that a man has adopted a child; (3) the consent of a
18 man to assisted reproduction that resulted in the birth of a child; (4) an adjudication
19 confirming a man as a parent of a child born to a gestational carrier; (5) a
20 presumption of paternity that arises if a man was married to or cohabiting with the
21 natural mother of a child or resides with and holds out a child as his natural child;
22 (6) genetic testing establishing a man as the father of a child; or (7) a voluntary
23 acknowledgment of paternity by a man. (NRS 126.041, 126.051, 126.053) Section
24 34 of this bill uses the gender-neutral language of the UPA to set forth the
25 circumstances in which a parent and child relationship is established between a
26 person and a child. Similarly, section 37 of this bill uses the gender-neutral
27 language of the UPA to establish the circumstances in which a person is presumed
28 to be a parent of a child.
29 Sections 38-51 of this bill establish provisions modeled after those of the UPA
30 relating to the voluntary acknowledgment or voluntary denial of parentage by
31 certain persons, including provisions relating to the requirements for, rescission of
32 and challenge to an acknowledgment of parentage or denial of parentage. Section
33 42 of this bill provides that, unless an acknowledgment of parentage or denial of
34 parentage is rescinded or challenged, such an acknowledgment of parentage or
35 denial of parentage that meets all requirements of law and is filed with the State
36 Registrar of Vital Statistics is equivalent to an adjudication of the parentage of a
37 child or the nonparentage of a person, respectively. Section 43 of this bill prohibits
38 the State Registrar of Vital Statistics from charging a fee for filing an
39 acknowledgment of parentage or denial of parentage, and section 51 of this bill
40 authorizes the State Board of Health to adopt any necessary regulations relating to
41 an acknowledgment of parentage or denial of parentage.
42 Existing law provides that in an action to determine paternity, a court is
43 authorized or required, depending on the circumstances, to order genetic testing of
44 a mother, child, alleged father or any other person. (NRS 126.121) Sections 52-68
45 of this bill establish various provisions modeled after those of the UPA concerning
46 genetic testing, including: (1) the limitation on the use of genetic testing; (2) the
47 authority to order, facilitate or deny genetic testing; (3) the requirements of genetic
48 testing; (4) reports and costs of genetic testing; (5) additional genetic testing when a
49 result is contested; (6) genetic testing when a specimen is not available from an
50 alleged genetic parent; and (7) genetic testing of a deceased person or identical
51 sibling. Section 68 of this bill provides that a person commits a misdemeanor if,
52 without proper authority, he or she intentionally releases an identifiable specimen
53 of another person collected for genetic testing for a purpose not relevant to a
54 proceeding regarding parentage.

– 3 –
55 Existing law establishes various provisions relating to an action to determine
56 paternity or maternity. (NRS 126.071-126.231) Sections 69-89 of this bill replace
57 several of those provisions with provisions modeled after those of the UPA
58 governing proceedings to adjudicate parentage. Existing law provides that if an
59 action to determine paternity is brought before the birth of a child, all proceedings
60 are generally required to be stayed until after the birth of the child. (NRS 126.071)
61 Section 84 of this bill instead authorizes a proceeding to adjudicate parentage to be
62 commenced and an order or judgment to be entered before the birth of a child, but
63 requires enforcement of the order or judgment to be stayed until after the birth of
64 the child.
65 Existing law does not bar an action to determine paternity until 3 years after a
66 child reaches the age of majority. (NRS 126.081) Sections 75 and 76 of this bill
67 instead provide that a proceeding to determine whether an alleged genetic parent or
68 presumed parent, respectively, is a parent of a child may be commenced after the
69 child becomes an adult if the child initiates the proceeding.
70 Existing law requires that an informal hearing be held after an action to
71 determine paternity has been brought and further requires a court to attempt to
72 resolve the issues raised in the action during the pretrial hearing. (NRS 126.111)
73 Section 136 of this bill repeals the provisions relating to such a pretrial hearing, as
74 the UPA does not require any such pretrial hearing to be conducted.
75 Section 77 of this bill authorizes a person who claims to be a de facto parent of
76 a child to commence a proceeding to establish parentage of the child if the child is
77 alive and less than 18 years of age. Section 77 provides that a person who claims to
78 be a de facto parent of a child must be adjudicated as a parent of the child if there is
79 only one other person who is a parent or has a claim to parentage of the child and
80 the person who claims to be a de facto parent can demonstrate certain facts by clear
81 and convincing evidence. Section 81 of this bill authorizes a court to adjudicate a
82 child to have more than two parents if the court finds that failure to recognize more
83 than two parents would be detrimental to the child.
84 Existing law establishes provisions concerning assisted reproduction and
85 gestational surrogacy. (NRS 126.500-126.810) This bill establishes only certain
86 provisions modeled after those of the UPA relating to such matters. Section 92 of
87 this bill establishes provisions relating to the parental status of certain persons who
88 die before a child is conceived by assisted reproduction. Section 93 of this bill
89 authorizes a party to a gestational agreement to terminate the agreement at any time
90 before an embryo transfer or, if an embryo transfer does not result in pregnancy, at
91 any time before a subsequent embryo transfer.
92 Existing law requires that a gestational agreement provide for the express
93 written agreement of the gestational carrier to undergo embryo or gamete transfer
94 and attempt to carry and give birth to any resulting child. (NRS 126.750) Section
95 107 of this bill requires that a gestational agreement also provide for the express
96 written agreement of the gestational carrier and any legal spouse or domestic
97 partner of the gestational carrier to acknowledge that each intended parent is the
98 legal and physical custodian of any resulting child. Section 107 also specifies that a
99 gestational carrier has the right to make all health and welfare decisions regarding
100 the gestational carrier and the pregnancy of the gestational carrier, including
101 whether to: (1) consent to a cesarean section or the transfer of multiple embryos;
102 (2) use the services of a health care practitioner chosen by the gestational carrier;
103 (3) terminate or continue the pregnancy; and (4) reduce or retain the number of
104 fetuses or embryos carried by the gestational carrier. Section 107 further provides
105 that any provision in a gestational agreement that contradicts such a right is void
106 and unenforceable.
107 Existing law provides that the subsequent marriage or domestic partnership of a
108 gestational carrier after the execution of a gestational agreement does not affect the
109 validity of the agreement. (NRS 126.770) Section 108 of this bill provides that the
-
*AB371_R2*

– 4 –
110 subsequent marriage, domestic partnership or divorce of any party to a gestational
111 agreement does not affect the validity of the agreement unless the agreement
112 expressly provides otherwise.
113 Existing law provides that if a gestational carrier breaches a gestational
114 agreement, a specific performance remedy that would require the gestational carrier
115 to be impregnated is prohibited. (NRS 126.780) Section 109 of this bill instead
116 provides that specific performance is not an available remedy with regard to a
117 gestational agreement except to enforce any provision in the agreement that is
118 necessary to enable the intended parents to exercise the full rights of parentage
119 immediately upon the birth of the child, if the intended parents are being prevented
120 from exercising such rights.
121 Sections 98-106 of this bill make various other changes to the provisions of
122 existing law concerning assisted reproduction and gestational surrogacy.
123 Section 136 repeals provisions of existing law that are not necessary because of
124 the establishment of the provisions modeled after those of the UPA in sections
125 28-91.
126 Sections 1, 94-97, 110-133 and 136 of this bill make conforming changes to
127 reflect the revisions made to existing law because of the establishment of the
128 provisions modeled after those of the UPA in sections 28-91 and the repeal of
129 unnecessary provisions in section 136.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 125C.003 is hereby amended to read as
2 follows:
3 125C.003 [1.] A court may award primary physical custody
4 to a parent if the court determines that joint physical custody is not
5 in the best interest of a child. An award of joint physical custody is

13 and is filed with the State Registrar of Vital Statistics with an
14 acknowledgment of parentage that complies with sections 38 to 51,
15 inclusive, of this act is equivalent to an adjudication of the
16 nonparentage of the presumed parent or alleged genetic parent
17 who signed the denial and discharges the presumed parent or
18 alleged genetic parent who signed the denial from all rights and
19 duties of a parent.

21 charge a fee for filing an acknowledgment of parentage or denial
22 of parentage.
23 Sec. 44. A court conducting a judicial proceeding or an
24 administrative agency conducting an administrative proceeding is
25 not required or permitted to ratify an unchallenged
26 acknowledgment of parentage. A court may determine that a
27 person who signed an acknowledgment of parentage is a parent in
28 a later proceeding based on other grounds.
29 Sec. 45. 1. A signatory may rescind an acknowledgment of
30 parentage or denial of parentage by filing with the State Registrar
31 of Vital Statistics a rescission in a signed record which is attested
32 by an electronic notary public or notarial officer or signed by at
33 least one witness, before the earlier of:
34 (a) Sixty days after the effective date under section 41 of this
35 act of the acknowledgment or denial; or
36 (b) The date of the first hearing before a court in a proceeding,
37 to which the signatory is a party, to adjudicate an issue relating to
38 the child, including a proceeding that establishes support.

40 subsection 1, an associated denial of parentage is invalid, and the
41 State Registrar of Vital Statistics shall notify the person who gave
42 birth to the child and the person who signed a denial of parentage
43 of the child that the acknowledgment has been rescinded. Failure
44 to give the notice required by this subsection does not affect the
45 validity of the rescission.

24 good cause.
25 4. A party challenging an acknowledgment of parentage or
26 denial of parentage has the burden of proof.
27 5. If the court determines that a party has satisfied the burden
28 of proof under subsection 4, the court shall order the State
29 Registrar of Vital Statistics to amend the birth record of the child
30 to reflect the legal parentage of the child.
31 6. A proceeding to challenge an acknowledgment of
32 parentage or denial of parentage must be conducted under
33 sections 69 to 89, inclusive, of this act.
34 Sec. 48. The court shall give full faith and credit to an
35 acknowledgment of parentage or denial of parentage effective in
36 another state if the acknowledgment or denial was in a signed
37 record and otherwise complies with the law of the other state.

*AB371_R2*

– 14 –
1 parentage, the court shall order the child and any other person to
2 submit to genetic testing if a request for testing is supported by the
3 sworn statement of a party:
4 (a) Alleging a reasonable possibility that the person is the
5 child’s genetic parent; or
6 (b) Denying genetic parentage of the child and stating facts
7 establishing a reasonable possibility that the person is not a
8 genetic parent.

10 there is no acknowledged or adjudicated parent of a child other
11 than the person who gave birth to the child.
12 3. The court may not order, and a child support agency may
13 not facilitate, in utero genetic testing.
14 4. If two or more persons are subject to court-ordered genetic
15 testing, the court may order that testing be completed concurrently
16 or sequentially.
17 5. Genetic testing of a person who gave birth to a child is not
18 a condition precedent to testing of the child and a person whose
19 genetic parentage of the child is being determined. If the person
20 who gave birth to the child is unavailable or declines to submit to
21 genetic testing, the court may order genetic testing of the child and
22 each person whose genetic parentage of the child is being
23 adjudicated.
24 6. In a proceeding to adjudicate the parentage of a child
25 having a presumed parent or a person who claims to be a parent
26 under section 77 of this act, or to challenge an acknowledgment of
27 parentage, the court may deny a motion for genetic testing of the
28 child and any other person after considering the factors in
29 subsections 1 and 2 of section 81 of this act.
30 7. If a person requesting genetic testing is barred under
31 sections 69 to 89, inclusive, of this act from establishing the
32 person’s parentage, the court shall deny the request for genetic
33 testing.
34 8. An order under this section for genetic testing is
35 enforceable by contempt.
36 Sec. 60. 1. Genetic testing must be of a type reasonably

39 (a) The AABB, formerly known as the American Association
40 of Blood Banks, or a successor to its functions; or
41 (b) An accrediting body designated by the Secretary of the
42 United States Department of Health and Human Services.
43 2. A specimen used in genetic testing may consist of a sample
44 or a combination of samples of blood, buccal cells, bone, hair or
45 other body tissue or fluid. The specimen used in the testing need
-
*AB371_R2*

– 15 –
1 not be of the same kind for each person undergoing genetic
2 testing.
3 3. Based on the ethnic or racial group of a person
4 undergoing genetic testing, a testing laboratory shall determine
5 the databases from which to select frequencies for use in
6 calculating a relationship index. If a person or a child support
7 agency objects to the laboratory’s choice, the following rules
8 apply:
9 (a) Not later than 30 days after receipt of the report of the test,
10 the objecting person or child support agency may request the court
11 to require the laboratory to recalculate the relationship index
12 using an ethnic or racial group different from that used by the
13 laboratory.
14 (b) The person or the child support agency objecting to the
15 laboratory’s choice under this subsection shall:
16 (1) If the requested frequencies are not available to the
17 laboratory for the ethnic or racial group requested, provide the
18 requested frequencies compiled in a manner recognized by
19 accrediting bodies; or
20 (2) Engage another laboratory to perform the calculations.
21 (c) The laboratory may use its own statistical estimate if there
22 is a question which ethnic or racial group is appropriate. The
23 laboratory shall calculate the frequencies using statistics, if
24 available, for any other ethnic or racial group requested.
25 4. If, after recalculation of the relationship index under
26 subsection 3 using a different ethnic or racial group, genetic
27 testing under section 62 of this act does not identify a person as a
28 genetic parent of a child, the court may require a person who has
29 been tested to submit to additional genetic testing to identify a
30 genetic parent.
31 Sec. 61. 1. A report of genetic testing must be in a record
32 and signed under penalty of perjury by a designee of the testing
33 laboratory. A report complying with the requirements of sections
34 52 to 68, inclusive, of this act is self-authenticating.
35 2. Documentation from a testing laboratory of the following
36 information is sufficient to establish a reliable chain of custody
37 and allow the results of genetic testing to be admissible without
38 testimony:
39 (a) The name and photograph of each person whose specimen
40 has been taken;
41 (b) The name of the person who collected each specimen;
42 (c) The place and date each specimen was collected;

1 Sec. 62. 1. Subject to a challenge under subsection 2, a
2 person is identified under sections 28 to 91, inclusive, of this act as
3 a genetic parent of a child if genetic testing complies with sections
4 52 to 68, inclusive, of this act and the results of the testing
5 disclose:
6 (a) The person has at least a 99 percent probability of
7 parentage, using a prior probability of 0.50, as calculated by using
8 the combined relationship index obtained in the testing; and
9 (b) A combined relationship index of at least 100 to 1.
10 2. A person identified under subsection 1 as a genetic parent
11 of the child may challenge the genetic testing results only by other
12 genetic testing satisfying the requirements of sections 52 to 68,
13 inclusive, of this act which:
14 (a) Excludes the person as a genetic parent of the child; or
15 (b) Identifies another person as a possible genetic parent of the
16 child other than:
17 (1) The person who gave birth to the child; or
18 (2) The person identified under subsection 1.
19 3. Except as otherwise provided in section 67 of this act, if
20 more than one person other than the person who gave birth to the
21 child is identified by genetic testing as a possible genetic parent of
22 the child, the court shall order each person to submit to further
23 genetic testing to identify a genetic parent.
24 Sec. 63. 1. Subject to assessment of fees under sections 69
25 to 89, inclusive, of this act, payment of the cost of initial genetic
26 testing must be made in advance:
27 (a) By the person who made the request for genetic testing;
28 (b) As agreed by the parties; or
29 (c) As ordered by the court.
30 2. If the cost of genetic testing is paid by a child support
31 agency, the agency may seek reimbursement from the genetic
32 parent whose parent and child relationship is established.
33 Sec. 64. The court shall order, or a child support agency may
34 facilitate, additional genetic testing on request of a person who
35 contests the result of the initial testing under section 62 of this act.
36 If initial genetic testing under section 62 of this act identified a
37 person as a genetic parent of the child, the court may not order,
38 and a child support agency may not facilitate, additional testing
39 unless the contesting person pays for the testing in advance.
40 Sec. 65. 1. Subject to subsection 2, if a genetic-testing
41 specimen is not available from an alleged genetic parent of a
42 child, a person seeking genetic testing demonstrates good cause
43 and the court finds that the circumstances are just, the court may
44 order any of the following persons to submit specimens for genetic
45 testing:
-
*AB371_R2*

– 17 –
1 (a) A parent of the alleged genetic parent;
2 (b) A sibling of the alleged genetic parent;
3 (c) Another child of the alleged genetic parent and the person
4 who gave birth to the other child; and
5 (d) Another relative of the alleged genetic parent necessary to
6 complete genetic testing.
7 2. To issue an order under this section, the court must find
8 that a need for genetic testing outweighs the legitimate interests of
9 the person sought to be tested.
10 Sec. 66. If a person seeking genetic testing demonstrates
11 good cause, the court may order genetic testing of a deceased
12 person.
13 Sec. 67. 1. If the court finds there is reason to believe that
14 an alleged genetic parent has an identical sibling and evidence
15 that the sibling may be a genetic parent of the child, the court may
16 order genetic testing of the sibling.
17 2. If more than one sibling is identified under section 62 of
18 this act as a genetic parent of the child, the court may rely on
19 nongenetic evidence to adjudicate which sibling is a genetic parent
20 of the child.
21 Sec. 68. 1. Release of a report of genetic testing for
22 parentage is controlled by law of this State other than sections 28
23 to 91, inclusive, of this act.
24 2. A person who intentionally releases an identifiable
25 specimen of another person collected for genetic testing under
26 sections 52 to 68, inclusive, of this act for a purpose not relevant to
27 a proceeding regarding parentage, without a court order or written
28 permission of the person who furnished the specimen, commits a
29 misdemeanor.

25 parent’s child; or

34 (b) If the presumed parent is identified under section 62 of this
35 act as a genetic parent of the child and that identification is not
36 successfully challenged under section 62 of this act, the court
37 shall adjudicate the presumed parent to be a parent of the child.

9 commence a proceeding to establish parentage of a child under
10 this section:
11 (a) Before the child attains 18 years of age; and
12 (b) While the child is alive.
13 3. The following rules govern standing of a person who
14 claims to be a de facto parent of a child to maintain a proceeding
15 under this section:

19 on all parents and legal guardians of the child and any other party
20 to the proceeding.
21 (b) An adverse party, parent or legal guardian may file a
22 pleading in response to the pleading filed under paragraph (a). A
23 responsive pleading must be verified and must be served on parties
24 to the proceeding.
25 (c) Unless the court finds a hearing is necessary to determine
26 disputed facts material to the issue of standing, the court shall

40 the child’s household for a significant period;

8 act, the court shall adjudicate the person to be a parent of the
9 child.
10 2. In a proceeding to adjudicate a person’s parentage of a
11 child, if another person other than the person who gave birth to
12 the child is a parent under NRS 126.500 to 126.810, inclusive, and
13 sections 92 and 93 of this act, the court shall adjudicate the
14 person’s parentage of the child under section 81 of this act.

41 parents under sections 28 to 91, inclusive, of this act if the court
42 finds that failure to recognize more than two parents would be
43 detrimental to the child. A finding of detriment to the child does
44 not require a finding of unfitness of any parent or person seeking
45 an adjudication of parentage. In determining detriment to the
-
*AB371_R2*

– 24 –
1 child, the court shall consider all relevant factors, including the
2 harm if the child is removed from a stable placement with a person

5 substantial period.

4 without a jury.
5 Sec. 87. The court may dismiss a proceeding under sections
6 28 to 91, inclusive, of this act for want of prosecution only without

11 the child in a manner provided by law of this State other than
12 sections 28 to 91, inclusive, of this act.

15 litem in the proceeding.
16 3. In a proceeding for divorce, dissolution, annulment,

21 order:
22 (a) Expressly identifies the child as a “child of the marriage”
23 or “issue of the marriage” or includes similar words indicating
24 that both spouses are parents of the child; or
25 (b) Provides for support of the child by a spouse or domestic
26 partner unless that spouse’s or domestic partner’s parentage of

2 conceived by assisted reproduction dies during the period between
3 the transfer of a gamete or embryo and the birth of the child, the
4 person’s death does not preclude the establishment of the person’s
5 parentage of the child if the person otherwise would be a parent of
6 the child under sections 28 to 91, inclusive, of this act.
7 2. If a person who consented in a record to assisted
8 reproduction by a person who agreed to give birth to a child dies
9 before a transfer of gametes or embryos, the deceased person is a
10 parent of a child conceived by the assisted reproduction only if:
11 (a) Either:

20 the person’s death; or
21 (2) The child is born not later than 45 months after the

25 intended parent dies before the transfer of a gamete or embryo
26 unless:
27 (a) The agreement provides otherwise; and
28 (b) The transfer of a gamete or embryo occurs not later than
29 36 months after the death of the intended parent or birth of the

33 terminate the agreement, at any time before an embryo transfer,
34 by giving notice of termination in a record to all other parties. If
35 an embryo transfer does not result in a pregnancy, a party may
36 terminate the agreement at any time before a subsequent embryo
37 transfer.
38 2. Unless a gestational agreement provides otherwise, on
39 termination of the agreement under subsection 1, the parties are
40 released from the agreement, except that each intended parent
41 remains responsible for expenses that are reimbursable under the

5 to determine custodial rights.
