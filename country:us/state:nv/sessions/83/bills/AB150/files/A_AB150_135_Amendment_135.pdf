Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits a person from threatening or intimidating a public officer, public
2 employee or certain other persons authorized to hear or determine a controversy or matter
3 with the intent to induce the officer, employee or person to act in a manner contrary to his or
4 her duties. A person who commits such an act is guilty of: (1) a category B or C felony, if
5 physical force or the immediate threat of physical force is used; and (2) a gross misdemeanor,
6 if no physical force or immediate threat of physical force is used. (NRS 199.300) Section 1 of
7 this bill : (1) makes this prohibition applicable to a person who threatens or intimidates [a
8 tribal judge of a federally recognized Indian tribe or nation, all or part of which is located
9 within the boundaries of this State.] any judicial personnel of an Indian tribe; and (2)
10 defines the terms “judicial personnel” and “Indian tribe” for such purposes as defined in
11 federal law.
12 Existing law provides that an assault without a deadly weapon or a battery without a
13 deadly weapon, other than a battery causing substantial harm to the victim or committed by
14 strangulation, is punishable as a misdemeanor. (NRS 200.471, 200.481) A person who
15 commits an assault without a deadly weapon against an officer, including certain justices and

Assembly Amendment No. 135 to Assembly Bill No. 150 Page 4
16 judges, in the performance of his or her duties and where the perpetrator knows or should
17 have known that the victim is an officer is instead guilty of: (1) a category D felony, if the
18 perpetrator is a probationer, prisoner who is in lawful custody or confinement or parolee; and
19 (2) in all other cases, a gross misdemeanor. (NRS 200.471) Additionally, a person who
20 commits a battery without a deadly weapon against such an officer in the performance of his
21 or her duties and where the perpetrator knows or should have known that the victim is an
22 officer is instead guilty of: (1) a category B felony if the battery involves substantial bodily
23 harm or strangulation or the perpetrator is a probationer, prisoner who is in lawful custody or
24 confinement or parolee; and (2) in all other cases where there is no substantial bodily harm or
25 strangulation, a gross misdemeanor. (NRS 200.481) Sections 2 and 3 of this bill expand the
26 term “officer” to include a [tribal judge] public defender, certain court personnel and any
27 judicial personnel of an Indian tribe for purposes of such enhanced penalties.
28 Existing law authorizes certain persons to obtain a court order to require a county
29 assessor, a county recorder, the Secretary of State or a city or county clerk to maintain the
30 personal information of the person contained in their records in a confidential manner. The
31 persons authorized to obtain such orders include, among others, justices, judges, certain court
32 personnel, certain prosecutors and state or county public defenders. (NRS 247.540, 250.140,
33 293.908) Sections 4-6 of this bill further authorize [a tribal judge] any judicial personnel of
34 an Indian tribe to obtain such court orders.
35 Existing law authorizes certain persons, including certain judicial officers, to request that
36 the Department of Motor Vehicles display an alternate address on the person’s driver’s
37 license, commercial driver’s license or identification card. (NRS 481.091) Section 7 of this
38 bill further authorizes [a tribal judge] any judicial personnel of an Indian tribe to make such
39 requests of the Department.
