Existing law prohibits a person from threatening or intimidating a public
officer, public employee or certain other persons authorized to hear or determine a
controversy or matter with the intent to induce the officer, employee or person to
act in a manner contrary to his or her duties. A person who commits such an act is
guilty of: (1) a category B or C felony, if physical force or the immediate threat of
physical force is used; and (2) a gross misdemeanor, if no physical force or
immediate threat of physical force is used. (NRS 199.300) Section 1 of this bill: (1)
makes this prohibition applicable to a person who threatens or intimidates any
judicial personnel of an Indian tribe; and (2) defines the terms “judicial personnel”
and “Indian tribe” for such purposes as defined in federal law.
Existing law provides that an assault without a deadly weapon or a battery

an officer is instead guilty of: (1) a category D felony, if the perpetrator is a
probationer, prisoner who is in lawful custody or confinement or parolee; and (2) in
all other cases, a gross misdemeanor. (NRS 200.471) Additionally, a person who
commits a battery without a deadly weapon against such an officer in the
performance of his or her duties and where the perpetrator knows or should have
known that the victim is an officer is instead guilty of: (1) a category B felony if the
battery involves substantial bodily harm or strangulation or the perpetrator is a
probationer, prisoner who is in lawful custody or confinement or parolee; and (2) in
all other cases where there is no substantial bodily harm or strangulation, a gross
misdemeanor. (NRS 200.481) Sections 2 and 3 of this bill expand the term
“officer” to include a public defender, certain court personnel and any judicial
personnel of an Indian tribe for purposes of such enhanced penalties.
Existing law authorizes certain persons to obtain a court order to require a
county assessor, a county recorder, the Secretary of State or a city or county clerk
to maintain the personal information of the person contained in their records in a

others, justices, judges, certain court personnel, certain prosecutors and state or

further authorize any judicial personnel of an Indian tribe to obtain such court
orders.

Assembly Bill No. 150–Assemblymember Orentlicher
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to the criminal justice system; prohibiting a
person from threatening or intimidating any judicial
personnel of an Indian tribe; expanding the applicability of
enhanced penalties for assault and battery against certain
persons; authorizing any judicial personnel of an Indian tribe
to request a court order to maintain certain personal
information in the possession of a county recorder, a county
assessor or an elections official in a confidential manner;
authorizing any judicial personnel of an Indian tribe to
request the Department of Motor Vehicles to display an
alternate address on the driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license or identification card of the judicial personnel;
providing penalties; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law prohibits a person from threatening or intimidating a public
officer, public employee or certain other persons authorized to hear or determine a
controversy or matter with the intent to induce the officer, employee or person to
act in a manner contrary to his or her duties. A person who commits such an act is
guilty of: (1) a category B or C felony, if physical force or the immediate threat of
physical force is used; and (2) a gross misdemeanor, if no physical force or
immediate threat of physical force is used. (NRS 199.300) Section 1 of this bill: (1)
makes this prohibition applicable to a person who threatens or intimidates any
judicial personnel of an Indian tribe; and (2) defines the terms “judicial personnel”
and “Indian tribe” for such purposes as defined in federal law.
Existing law provides that an assault without a deadly weapon or a battery
without a deadly weapon, other than a battery causing substantial harm to the
victim or committed by strangulation, is punishable as a misdemeanor. (NRS
200.471, 200.481) A person who commits an assault without a deadly weapon
against an officer, including certain justices and judges, in the performance of his or
her duties and where the perpetrator knows or should have known that the victim is
an officer is instead guilty of: (1) a category D felony, if the perpetrator is a
probationer, prisoner who is in lawful custody or confinement or parolee; and (2) in
all other cases, a gross misdemeanor. (NRS 200.471) Additionally, a person who
commits a battery without a deadly weapon against such an officer in the
performance of his or her duties and where the perpetrator knows or should have
known that the victim is an officer is instead guilty of: (1) a category B felony if the
battery involves substantial bodily harm or strangulation or the perpetrator is a
probationer, prisoner who is in lawful custody or confinement or parolee; and (2) in
all other cases where there is no substantial bodily harm or strangulation, a gross
misdemeanor. (NRS 200.481) Sections 2 and 3 of this bill expand the term
“officer” to include a public defender, certain court personnel and any judicial
personnel of an Indian tribe for purposes of such enhanced penalties.
Existing law authorizes certain persons to obtain a court order to require a
county assessor, a county recorder, the Secretary of State or a city or county clerk
to maintain the personal information of the person contained in their records in a
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 2 –
confidential manner. The persons authorized to obtain such orders include, among
others, justices, judges, certain court personnel, certain prosecutors and state or
county public defenders. (NRS 247.540, 250.140, 293.908) Sections 4-6 of this bill
further authorize any judicial personnel of an Indian tribe to obtain such court
orders.
Existing law authorizes certain persons, including certain judicial officers, to
request that the Department of Motor Vehicles display an alternate address on the
person’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s license or identification card. (NRS
481.091) Section 7 of this bill further authorizes any judicial personnel of an Indian
tribe to make such requests of the Department.
