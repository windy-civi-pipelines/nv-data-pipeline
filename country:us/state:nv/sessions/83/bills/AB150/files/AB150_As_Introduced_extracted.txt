Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits a person from threatening or intimidating a public
2 officer, public employee or certain other persons authorized to hear or determine a
3 controversy or matter with the intent to induce the officer, employee or person to
4 act in a manner contrary to his or her duties. A person who commits such an act is
5 guilty of: (1) a category B or C felony, if physical force or the immediate threat of
6 physical force is used; and (2) a gross misdemeanor, if no physical force or
7 immediate threat of physical force is used. (NRS 199.300) Section 1 of this bill
8 makes this prohibition applicable to a person who threatens or intimidates a tribal
9 judge of a federally recognized Indian tribe or nation, all or part of which is located
10 within the boundaries of this State.
11 Existing law provides that an assault without a deadly weapon or a battery
12 without a deadly weapon, other than a battery causing substantial harm to the
-
*AB150*
– 2 –
13 victim or committed by strangulation, is punishable as a misdemeanor. (NRS
14 200.471, 200.481) A person who commits an assault without a deadly weapon
15 against an officer, including certain justices and judges, in the performance of his or
16 her duties and where the perpetrator knows or should have known that the victim is
17 an officer is instead guilty of: (1) a category D felony, if the perpetrator is a
18 probationer, prisoner who is in lawful custody or confinement or parolee; and (2) in
19 all other cases, a gross misdemeanor. (NRS 200.471) Additionally, a person who
20 commits a battery without a deadly weapon against such an officer in the
21 performance of his or her duties and where the perpetrator knows or should have
22 known that the victim is an officer is instead guilty of: (1) a category B felony if the
23 battery involves substantial bodily harm or strangulation or the perpetrator is a
24 probationer, prisoner who is in lawful custody or confinement or parolee; and (2) in
25 all other cases where there is no substantial bodily harm or strangulation, a gross
26 misdemeanor. (NRS 200.481) Sections 2 and 3 of this bill expand the term
27 “officer” to include a tribal judge for purposes of such enhanced penalties.
28 Existing law authorizes certain persons to obtain a court order to require a
29 county assessor, a county recorder, the Secretary of State or a city or county clerk
30 to maintain the personal information of the person contained in their records in a
31 confidential manner. The persons authorized to obtain such orders include, among
32 others, justices, judges, certain court personnel, certain prosecutors and state or
33 county public defenders. (NRS 247.540, 250.140, 293.908) Sections 4-6 of this bill
34 further authorize a tribal judge to obtain such court orders.
35 Existing law authorizes certain persons, including certain judicial officers, to
36 request that the Department of Motor Vehicles display an alternate address on the
37 person’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s license or identification card. (NRS
38 481.091) Section 7 of this bill further authorizes a tribal judge to make such
39 requests of the Department.

~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to judges; prohibiting a person from threatening or
intimidating a tribal judge of certain federally recognized
Indian tribes or nations; expanding the applicability of
enhanced penalties for assault and battery against a tribal
judge; authorizing a tribal judge to request a court order to
maintain certain personal information in the possession of

official in a confidential manner; authorizing a tribal
judge to request the Department of Motor Vehicles to
display an alternate address on the driver’s license,
commercial driver’s license or identification card of the
tribal judge; providing penalties; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits a person from threatening or intimidating a public
2 officer, public employee or certain other persons authorized to hear or determine a
3 controversy or matter with the intent to induce the officer, employee or person to
4 act in a manner contrary to his or her duties. A person who commits such an act is
5 guilty of: (1) a category B or C felony, if physical force or the immediate threat of
6 physical force is used; and (2) a gross misdemeanor, if no physical force or
7 immediate threat of physical force is used. (NRS 199.300) Section 1 of this bill
8 makes this prohibition applicable to a person who threatens or intimidates a tribal
9 judge of a federally recognized Indian tribe or nation, all or part of which is located
10 within the boundaries of this State.
11 Existing law provides that an assault without a deadly weapon or a battery
12 without a deadly weapon, other than a battery causing substantial harm to the
-
*AB150*

– 2 –
13 victim or committed by strangulation, is punishable as a misdemeanor. (NRS
14 200.471, 200.481) A person who commits an assault without a deadly weapon
15 against an officer, including certain justices and judges, in the performance of his or
16 her duties and where the perpetrator knows or should have known that the victim is
17 an officer is instead guilty of: (1) a category D felony, if the perpetrator is a
18 probationer, prisoner who is in lawful custody or confinement or parolee; and (2) in
19 all other cases, a gross misdemeanor. (NRS 200.471) Additionally, a person who
20 commits a battery without a deadly weapon against such an officer in the
21 performance of his or her duties and where the perpetrator knows or should have
22 known that the victim is an officer is instead guilty of: (1) a category B felony if the
23 battery involves substantial bodily harm or strangulation or the perpetrator is a
24 probationer, prisoner who is in lawful custody or confinement or parolee; and (2) in
25 all other cases where there is no substantial bodily harm or strangulation, a gross
26 misdemeanor. (NRS 200.481) Sections 2 and 3 of this bill expand the term
27 “officer” to include a tribal judge for purposes of such enhanced penalties.
28 Existing law authorizes certain persons to obtain a court order to require a
29 county assessor, a county recorder, the Secretary of State or a city or county clerk
30 to maintain the personal information of the person contained in their records in a
31 confidential manner. The persons authorized to obtain such orders include, among
32 others, justices, judges, certain court personnel, certain prosecutors and state or
33 county public defenders. (NRS 247.540, 250.140, 293.908) Sections 4-6 of this bill
34 further authorize a tribal judge to obtain such court orders.
35 Existing law authorizes certain persons, including certain judicial officers, to
36 request that the Department of Motor Vehicles display an alternate address on the
37 person’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s license or identification card. (NRS
38 481.091) Section 7 of this bill further authorizes a tribal judge to make such
39 requests of the Department.
