Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits a person from threatening or intimidating a public
2 officer, public employee or certain other persons authorized to hear or determine a
3 controversy or matter with the intent to induce the officer, employee or person to
4 act in a manner contrary to his or her duties. A person who commits such an act is
5 guilty of: (1) a category B or C felony, if physical force or the immediate threat of
6 physical force is used; and (2) a gross misdemeanor, if no physical force or
7 immediate threat of physical force is used. (NRS 199.300) Section 1 of this bill: (1)
8 makes this prohibition applicable to a person who threatens or intimidates any
9 judicial personnel of an Indian tribe; and (2) defines the terms “judicial personnel”
10 and “Indian tribe” for such purposes as defined in federal law.

15 against an officer, including certain justices and judges, in the performance of his or
16 her duties and where the perpetrator knows or should have known that the victim is
17 an officer is instead guilty of: (1) a category D felony, if the perpetrator is a

24 probationer, prisoner who is in lawful custody or confinement or parolee; and (2) in
25 all other cases where there is no substantial bodily harm or strangulation, a gross
26 misdemeanor. (NRS 200.481) Sections 2 and 3 of this bill expand the term
27 “officer” to include a public defender, certain court personnel and any judicial
28 personnel of an Indian tribe for purposes of such enhanced penalties.
29 Existing law authorizes certain persons to obtain a court order to require a
30 county assessor, a county recorder, the Secretary of State or a city or county clerk
31 to maintain the personal information of the person contained in their records in a
32 confidential manner. The persons authorized to obtain such orders include, among
33 others, justices, judges, certain court personnel, certain prosecutors and state or
34 county public defenders. (NRS 247.540, 250.140, 293.908) Sections 4-6 of this bill
