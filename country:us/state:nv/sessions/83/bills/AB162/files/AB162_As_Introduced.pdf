7 or vulnerable persons, a statewide registry of sex offenders and offenders convicted
8 of a crime against a child and a community notification website which provides the
9 public with access to certain information contained in the statewide registry. (NRS
10 179A.075, 179A.350, 179A.450, 179B.200, 179B.250) Section 2 of this bill

13 act or combination of acts that constitute domestic violence; and (2) an Internet
14 website to provide the public with access at no charge to certain information
15 contained in the statewide database.
16 Section 2 further: (1) requires the statewide database to make available to a

18 to the extent that such information is available; (2) prohibits the statewide database
19 from providing certain confidential information to a requester; (3) requires that the

1 may be used in any other way to the advantage of the governmental
2 entity or of the general public. This section does not supersede or in
3 any manner affect the federal laws governing copyrights or enlarge,
4 diminish or affect in any other manner the rights of a person in any
5 written book or record which is copyrighted pursuant to federal law.
6 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record

23 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
24 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
