projects awarded by a public utility relating to

subcontractor who is awarded a contract for construction
work on certain infrastructure projects by a public utility

1 Existing law sets forth general provisions applicable to public works, including
2 provisions requiring, with certain exceptions, the payment of prevailing wages for
3 public works projects. (NRS 338.013-338.090) Section 2 of this bill makes a
4 declaration of legislative intent finding that the payment of prevailing wages to
5 workers employed by a contractor or subcontractor to perform construction work
6 on projects awarded by a public utility relating to infrastructure for natural gas is
7 necessary for the safety of the public and to ensure the highest quality of work on
8 such projects. Section 3 of this bill requires a contractor or subcontractor who is
9 awarded a contract for construction work on a significant natural gas infrastructure
10 project by a public utility to comply with prevailing wage provisions applicable to
11 public works, even if the construction work does not qualify as a public work.
12 Section 3 also defines “public utility” and “significant natural gas infrastructure
13 project” for the purposes of that section.
