2 and development of renewable natural resources is best led and
3 directed by persons in local communities and, as such, has
4 authorized the creation of conservation districts, comprised of
5 members of local communities, to oversee certain projects and
6 measures relating to the conservation and development of renewable

14 with local communities by declaring that it is the policy of the
15 United States when conducting the land use planning process for
16 public lands and the resources of such public lands to coordinate
17 with other federal and state planning efforts; and
18 WHEREAS, A variety of federal laws that regulate federal actions
