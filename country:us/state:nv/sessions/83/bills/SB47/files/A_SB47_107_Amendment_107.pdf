Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 The federal Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction
2 Equity Act of 2008 prohibits certain health insurers from imposing terms on benefits for
3 mental health or substance use disorder that are less favorable than the terms imposed on
4 medical and surgical benefits. (42 U.S.C. § 300gg-26) Existing state law requires certain
5 health insurers to: (1) comply with the Act; and (2) provide to the Commissioner of Insurance
6 certain data necessary to evaluate compliance with the Act. (NRS 687B.404)
7 Section 7 of this bill requires the Commissioner to apply for gifts, grants and donations to
8 support a study of the degree to which public and private insurance plans in this State achieve
9 parity between coverage for behavioral health care and coverage for other medical care. To
10 the extent that the Commissioner obtains sufficient money, section 7 requires the
11 Commissioner to enter into a contract with a qualified person or entity to conduct the study.
12 Section 8 of this bill requires public and private health insurers in this State and certain other
13 persons or entities to submit data to the Commissioner or the contractor as necessary to
14 conduct the study. Section 9 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner to issue a subpoena for
15 the production of such data if a person or entity fails to comply with section 8. Sections 8 and
16 11 of this bill provide for the confidentiality of any personally identifiable information,
17 proprietary financial information, trade secret or other confidential information that is
18 submitted to the Commissioner pursuant to section 8. Section 10 of this bill requires: (1) the
19 Commissioner to submit an annual report to the Legislature concerning the progress of the
20 efforts to fund and conduct the study; and (2) the contractor who conducts the study to report
21 the results to the Commissioner, the Governor and the Legislature upon completion of the
22 study. Sections 3-6 of this bill define certain terms used in sections 3-10. Section 2 of this bill
23 establishes the applicability of those definitions.

24 Statutes of Nevada 2011 and section 2 of chapter 391, Statutes of Nevada 2013 and
25 unless otherwise declared by law to be confidential, all public books and public
26 records of a governmental entity must be open at all times during office hours to
27 inspection by any person, and may be fully copied or an abstract or memorandum
28 may be prepared from those public books and public records. Any such copies,
29 abstracts or memoranda may be used to supply the general public with copies,
30 abstracts or memoranda of the records or may be used in any other way to the
31 advantage of the governmental entity or of the general public. This section does not
32 supersede or in any manner affect the federal laws governing copyrights or enlarge,
33 diminish or affect in any other manner the rights of a person in any written book or
34 record which is copyrighted pursuant to federal law.
35 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record which is
36 copyrighted solely because it is copyrighted.
37 3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a public book or
38 record shall not deny a request made pursuant to subsection 1 to inspect or copy or
39 receive a copy of a public book or record on the basis that the requested public
40 book or record contains information that is confidential if the governmental entity
41 can redact, delete, conceal or separate, including, without limitation, electronically,
42 the confidential information from the information included in the public book or
43 record that is not otherwise confidential.
44 4. If requested, a governmental entity shall provide a copy of a public record
45 in an electronic format by means of an electronic medium. Nothing in this
46 subsection requires a governmental entity to provide a copy of a public record in an
47 electronic format or by means of an electronic medium if:
48 (a) The public record:
49 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
50 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
51 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by means of an
52 electronic medium would:
53 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or

Senate Amendment No. 107 to Senate Bill No. 47 Page 9
1 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential and that
2 cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from information that is not
3 otherwise confidential.
4 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who has legal
5 custody or control of a public record:
6 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the medium that
7 is requested because the officer, employee or agent has already prepared or would
8 prefer to provide the copy in a different medium.
9 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon request, prepare
10 the copy of the public record and shall not require the person who has requested the
11 copy to prepare the copy himself or herself.
12 Sec. 12. The provisions of subsection 1 of NRS 218D.380 do not apply to
13 any provision of this act which adds or revises a requirement to submit a report to
14 the Legislature.
15 Sec. 13. This act becomes effective upon passage and approval and expires
16 by limitation on the date on which the person or entity with whom the
17 Commissioner of Insurance enters into a contract pursuant to subsection 1 of
18 section 7 of this act submits the report described in subsection 2 of section 10 of
19 this act to the Commissioner of Insurance, the Governor and the Director of the
