Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 The federal Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and
2 Addiction Equity Act of 2008 prohibits certain health insurers from imposing terms
3 on benefits for mental health or substance use disorder that are less favorable than
4 the terms imposed on medical and surgical benefits. (42 U.S.C. § 300gg-26)
5 Existing state law requires certain health insurers to: (1) comply with the Act; and
6 (2) provide to the Commissioner of Insurance certain data necessary to evaluate
7 compliance with the Act. (NRS 687B.404)
8 Section 7 of this bill requires the Commissioner to apply for gifts, grants and
9 donations to support a study of the degree to which public and private insurance
10 plans in this State achieve parity between coverage for behavioral health care and
11 coverage for other medical care. To the extent that the Commissioner obtains
12 sufficient money, section 7 requires the Commissioner to enter into a contract with
13 a qualified person or entity to conduct the study. Section 8 of this bill requires
14 public and private health insurers in this State and certain other persons or entities
15 to submit data to the Commissioner or the contractor as necessary to conduct the
16 study. Section 9 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner to issue a subpoena for
17 the production of such data if a person or entity fails to comply with section 8.
18 Sections 8 and 11 of this bill provide for the confidentiality of any personally
19 identifiable information, proprietary financial information, trade secret or other

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 The federal Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and

3 on benefits for mental health or substance use disorder that are less favorable than
4 the terms imposed on medical and surgical benefits. (42 U.S.C. § 300gg-26)
5 Existing state law requires certain health insurers to: (1) comply with the Act; and
6 (2) provide to the Commissioner of Insurance certain data necessary to evaluate
7 compliance with the Act. (NRS 687B.404)
8 Section 7 of this bill requires the Commissioner to apply for gifts, grants and
9 donations to support a study of the degree to which public and private insurance
10 plans in this State achieve parity between coverage for behavioral health care and
11 coverage for other medical care. To the extent that the Commissioner obtains
12 sufficient money, section 7 requires the Commissioner to enter into a contract with
13 a qualified person or entity to conduct the study. Section 8 of this bill requires
14 public and private health insurers in this State and certain other persons or entities
15 to submit data to the Commissioner or the contractor as necessary to conduct the
16 study. Section 9 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner to issue a subpoena for
17 the production of such data if a person or entity fails to comply with section 8.

2 711.600, section 8 of this act, sections 35, 38 and 41 of chapter 478,
3 Statutes of Nevada 2011 and section 2 of chapter 391, Statutes of
4 Nevada 2013 and unless otherwise declared by law to be
5 confidential, all public books and public records of a governmental
6 entity must be open at all times during office hours to inspection by
7 any person, and may be fully copied or an abstract or memorandum
8 may be prepared from those public books and public records. Any
9 such copies, abstracts or memoranda may be used to supply the
10 general public with copies, abstracts or memoranda of the records or
11 may be used in any other way to the advantage of the governmental
12 entity or of the general public. This section does not supersede or in
13 any manner affect the federal laws governing copyrights or enlarge,
14 diminish or affect in any other manner the rights of a person in any
15 written book or record which is copyrighted pursuant to federal law.
16 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record
17 which is copyrighted solely because it is copyrighted.
18 3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a
19 public book or record shall not deny a request made pursuant to
20 subsection 1 to inspect or copy or receive a copy of a public book or
21 record on the basis that the requested public book or record contains
22 information that is confidential if the governmental entity can
23 redact, delete, conceal or separate, including, without limitation,

25 included in the public book or record that is not otherwise
26 confidential.
27 4. If requested, a governmental entity shall provide a copy of a
28 public record in an electronic format by means of an electronic
29 medium. Nothing in this subsection requires a governmental entity
30 to provide a copy of a public record in an electronic format or by
31 means of an electronic medium if:
32 (a) The public record:
33 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
34 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
35 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by
36 means of an electronic medium would:
37 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
38 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential
39 and that cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from
40 information that is not otherwise confidential.
41 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who
42 has legal custody or control of a public record:
43 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the
44 medium that is requested because the officer, employee or agent has

1 already prepared or would prefer to provide the copy in a different
2 medium.
3 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon
4 request, prepare the copy of the public record and shall not require
5 the person who has requested the copy to prepare the copy himself
6 or herself.
7 Sec. 12. The provisions of subsection 1 of NRS 218D.380 do
8 not apply to any provision of this act which adds or revises a
9 requirement to submit a report to the Legislature.
10 Sec. 13. This act becomes effective upon passage and approval
11 and expires by limitation on the date on which the person or entity
12 with whom the Commissioner of Insurance enters into a contract
13 pursuant to subsection 1 of section 7 of this act submits the report
14 described in subsection 2 of section 10 of this act to the
15 Commissioner of Insurance, the Governor and the Director of the
