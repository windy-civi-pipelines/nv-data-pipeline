Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 The federal Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and
2 Addiction Equity Act of 2008 prohibits certain health insurers from imposing terms
3 on benefits for mental health or substance use disorder that are less favorable than
4 the terms imposed on medical and surgical benefits. (42 U.S.C. § 300gg-26)
5 Existing state law requires certain health insurers to: (1) comply with the Act; and
6 (2) provide to the Commissioner of Insurance certain data necessary to evaluate
7 compliance with the Act. (NRS 687B.404)
8 Section 7 of this bill requires the Commissioner to apply for gifts, grants and
9 donations to support a study of the degree to which public and private insurance
10 plans in this State achieve parity between coverage for behavioral health care and
11 coverage for other medical care. To the extent that the Commissioner obtains
12 sufficient money, section 7 requires the Commissioner to enter into a contract with
13 a qualified person or entity to conduct the study. Section 8 of this bill requires
14 public and private health insurers in this State and certain other persons or entities
15 to submit data to the Commissioner or the contractor as necessary to conduct the
16 study. Section 9 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner to issue a subpoena for
17 the production of such data if a person or entity fails to comply with section 8.
18 Sections 8 and 11 of this bill provide for the confidentiality of any personally
19 identifiable information, proprietary financial information, trade secret or other

36 record on the basis that the requested public book or record contains

4 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
