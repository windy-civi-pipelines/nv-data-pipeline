Section 1:
Health and Human Services
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to child welfare; revising the actions relating to a
report, investigation or legal intervention concerning the
abuse or neglect of a child for which a person is granted
immunity from liability; authorizing a court to award
reasonable attorney’s fees and costs to certain persons who
prevail in a civil action for performing such actions; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing federal law establishes a program to award grants to states to support
programs to prevent the abuse or neglect of children and to treat children who have
been abused or neglected. Existing federal law requires states applying for such a
grant to submit a plan that includes assurances that the state has in effect provisions
of law granting immunity from civil or criminal liability to a person who: (1) makes
a good faith report of suspected or known instances of child abuse or neglect; or (2)
otherwise provides information or assistance in connection with a report,
investigation or legal intervention pursuant to a report. (42 U.S.C. § 5106a)
Existing state law sets forth certain specific actions relating to such a report,
investigation or legal intervention for which a person is granted immunity from
civil or criminal liability. (NRS 432B.160)
This bill adds to the list of actions for which a person is granted immunity
reviewing or providing consultation or a medical opinion concerning photographs,
x-rays and other medical tests taken by a person investigating a report of abuse or
neglect of a child. This bill also authorizes a court to award reasonable attorney’s
fees and costs to a person who is required to report suspected or known abuse or
neglect of a child who prevails in a civil action to impose liability against him or
her for performing such an act.
