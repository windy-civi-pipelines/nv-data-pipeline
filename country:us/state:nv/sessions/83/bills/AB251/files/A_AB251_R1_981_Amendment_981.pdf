AN ACT relating to food inspections; revising provisions governing custom
processing establishments and mobile processing units for certain
purposes relating to the inspection of meat and poultry; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law defines “official establishment” to mean, with certain exceptions, an
2 establishment in this State which on a commercial basis slaughters for hire any meat animal,
3 game mammal, poultry or game bird for human consumption and which has been inspected
4 and approved by the State Quarantine Officer. (NRS 583.375) Under existing law, a custom
5 processing establishment and mobile processing unit slaughter or process livestock or poultry
6 for or upon request by the owner or person in lawful possession of the livestock or poultry.
7 (NRS 583.277, 583.357) Existing law requires the State Quarantine Officer to adopt
8 regulations, consistent with federal law, providing a process for a person to obtain a license to
9 operate a custom processing establishment or a mobile processing unit in this State. When a
10 person is issued a license to operate a custom processing facility or mobile processing unit
11 pursuant to these regulations, existing law provides that the custom processing facility or
12 mobile processing unit shall be deemed an official establishment for the purposes of certain
13 provisions governing the inspection of meat and poultry. (NRS 583.454) Section 3 of this bill
14 requires the State Quarantine Officer to adopt regulations providing a process for a person to
15 obtain a license to operate a mobile processing unit which must authorize a mobile processing
16 unit to perform custom processing and operate as an official establishment and slaughter
17 certain animals on a commercial basis for interstate commerce. Section 3 also requires the
18 Officer to adopt regulations to authorize a custom processing establishment or mobile
19 processing unit to slaughter certain animals on a commercial basis for intrastate sale.
20 Section 1.5 of this bill revises the definition of “custom processing establishment” to: (1)
21 remove the requirement that the facility be fixed; and (2) provide that a custom processing
22 establishment is licensed in accordance with the regulations adopted by the Officer to perform
23 custom processing or slaughter certain animals for human consumption on a commercial basis
24 in intrastate commerce. Section 1.7 of this bill revises the definition of “mobile processing
25 unit” to provide that a mobile processing unit is licensed in accordance with the regulations
26 adopted by the Officer to perform custom processing or slaughter certain animals for human
27 consumption on a commercial basis for interstate or intrastate commerce.
28 Section 1 of this bill defines “custom processing” as the slaughter, skinning and
29 preparation of livestock and poultry upon request of the owner or person in lawful possession
30 of the livestock or poultry and for consumption by the owner or person. Section 1.3 of this bill

Senate Amendment No. 981 to Assembly Bill No. 251 First Reprint Page 4
31 applies certain definitions in existing law and section 1 relating to the inspection of meat and
32 poultry to the provisions of this bill.
