Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law defines “official establishment” to mean, with certain exceptions,
2 an establishment in this State which on a commercial basis slaughters for hire any
3 meat animal, game mammal, poultry or game bird for human consumption and
4 which has been inspected and approved by the State Quarantine Officer. (NRS
5 583.375) Under existing law, a custom processing establishment and mobile
6 processing unit slaughter or process livestock or poultry for or upon request by the
7 owner or person in lawful possession of the livestock or poultry. (NRS 583.277,
8 583.357) Existing law requires the State Quarantine Officer to adopt regulations,
9 consistent with federal law, providing a process for a person to obtain a license to
10 operate a custom processing establishment or a mobile processing unit in this State.
11 When a person is issued a license to operate a custom processing facility or mobile
12 processing unit pursuant to these regulations, existing law provides that the custom
13 processing facility or mobile processing unit shall be deemed an official
14 establishment for the purposes of certain provisions governing the inspection of
15 meat and poultry. (NRS 583.454) Section 3 of this bill requires the State
16 Quarantine Officer to adopt regulations providing a process for a person to obtain a
17 license to operate a mobile processing unit which must authorize a mobile
18 processing unit to perform custom processing and operate as an official
19 establishment and slaughter certain animals on a commercial basis for interstate
20 commerce. Section 3 also requires the Officer to adopt regulations to authorize a
21 custom processing establishment or mobile processing unit to slaughter certain
22 animals on a commercial basis for intrastate sale.
23 Section 1.5 of this bill revises the definition of “custom processing
24 establishment” to: (1) remove the requirement that the facility be fixed; and (2)

25 provide that a custom processing establishment is licensed in accordance with the
26 regulations adopted by the Officer to perform custom processing or slaughter
27 certain animals for human consumption on a commercial basis in intrastate
28 commerce. Section 1.7 of this bill revises the definition of “mobile processing unit”
29 to provide that a mobile processing unit is licensed in accordance with the
30 regulations adopted by the Officer to perform custom processing or slaughter
31 certain animals for human consumption on a commercial basis for interstate or
32 intrastate commerce.
33 Section 1 of this bill defines “custom processing” as the slaughter, skinning and
34 preparation of livestock and poultry upon request of the owner or person in lawful
35 possession of the livestock or poultry and for consumption by the owner or person.
36 Section 1.3 of this bill applies certain definitions in existing law and section 1
37 relating to the inspection of meat and poultry to the provisions of this bill.
