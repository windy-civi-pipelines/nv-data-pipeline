Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law defines “official establishment” to mean, with certain exceptions, an
2 establishment in this State which on a commercial basis slaughters for hire any meat [,]
3 animal, game mammal, poultry or game bird for human consumption and which has been
4 inspected and approved by the State Quarantine Officer. (NRS 583.375) Under existing law,
5 a custom processing establishment and mobile processing unit slaughter or process
6 livestock or poultry for or upon request by the owner or person in lawful possession of
7 the livestock or poultry. (NRS 583.277, 583.357) Existing law requires the State Quarantine
8 Officer to adopt regulations, consistent with federal law, providing a process for a person to
9 obtain a license to operate a custom processing establishment or a mobile processing unit in
10 this State. When a person is issued a license to operate a custom processing facility or mobile
11 processing unit pursuant to these regulations, existing law provides that the custom processing
12 facility or mobile processing unit shall be deemed an official establishment for the purposes of
13 certain provisions governing the inspection of meat and poultry. (NRS 583.454) [Sections 1
14 and 2 of this bill revise the definitions of “mobile processing unit” and “official

17 establishment.] Section 3 of this bill [removes the requirement for] requires the State
18 Quarantine Officer to adopt regulations providing a process for a person to obtain a license to

20 subject to the same permitting requirements] to perform custom processing and operate as
21 an official establishment [as a result of the changes in sections 1 and 2.] and slaughter
22 certain animals on a commercial basis for interstate commerce. Section 3 also requires
23 the Officer to adopt regulations to authorize a custom processing establishment or
24 mobile processing unit to slaughter certain animals on a commercial basis for intrastate
25 sale.
26 Section 1.5 of this bill revises the definition of “custom processing establishment” to:
27 (1) remove the requirement that the facility be fixed; and (2) provide that a custom
28 processing establishment is licensed in accordance with the regulations adopted by the
29 Officer to perform custom processing or slaughter certain animals for human

30 consumption on a commercial basis in intrastate commerce. Section 1.7 of this bill
31 revises the definition of “mobile processing unit” to provide that a mobile processing
32 unit is licensed in accordance with the regulations adopted by the Officer to perform
33 custom processing or slaughter certain animals for human consumption on a
34 commercial basis for interstate or intrastate commerce.
35 Section 1 of this bill defines “custom processing” as the slaughter, skinning and
36 preparation of livestock and poultry upon request of the owner or person in lawful
37 possession of the livestock or poultry and for consumption by the owner or person.
38 Section 1.3 of this bill applies certain definitions in existing law and section 1 relating to
