SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to the inspection of meat
and poultry. (BDR 51-154)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to food inspections; providing that a “mobile
processing unit” is an official establishment for certain
purposes relating to the inspection of meat and poultry;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law defines “official establishment” to mean, with certain exceptions,
2 an establishment in this State which on a commercial basis slaughters for hire any
3 meat, animal, game mammal, poultry or game bird for human consumption and
4 which has been inspected and approved by the State Quarantine Officer. (NRS
5 583.375) Existing law requires the State Quarantine Officer to adopt regulations,
6 consistent with federal law, providing a process for a person to obtain a license to
7 operate a custom processing establishment or a mobile processing unit in this State.
8 When a person is issued a license to operate a custom processing facility or mobile
9 processing unit pursuant to these regulations, existing law provides that the custom
10 processing facility or mobile processing unit shall be deemed an official
11 establishment for the purposes of certain provisions governing the inspection of
12 meat and poultry. (NRS 583.454) Sections 1 and 2 of this bill revise the definitions
13 of “mobile processing unit” and “official establishment” to provide that a mobile
14 processing unit is an official establishment. As a result of this change, a mobile
15 processing unit is subject to the same requirements as an official establishment.
16 Section 3 of this bill removes the requirement for the State Quarantine Officer to
17 adopt regulations providing a process for a person to obtain a license to operate a
18 mobile processing unit because a mobile processing unit is subject to the same
19 permitting requirements as an official establishment as a result of the changes in
20 sections 1 and 2.
