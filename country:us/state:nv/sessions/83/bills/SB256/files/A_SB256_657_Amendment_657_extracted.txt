AN ACT relating to gaming; requiring the disgorgement of any profit, gain, gross
receipt or other benefit related to certain illegal gaming activities;
increasing a penalty; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits: (1) a person from engaging in certain activities relating to gaming
2 without procuring a state gaming license; (2) a person from engaging in a fraudulent act or
3 otherwise manipulating or cheating at a gambling game; and (3) a person from accepting,
4 receiving or allowing certain other persons to accept or receive certain wagers through any
5 medium of communication from another person physically present within this State. (NRS
6 463.160, 465.070, 465.092) Sections 1-3 of this bill require, in addition to any existing
7 penalty, a person to disgorge any profit, gain, gross receipt or other benefit resulting from
8 certain illegal gaming activities and pay that amount to the State Treasurer for deposit in the
9 State General Fund. Section 3 also increases the penalty for accepting, receiving or allowing
10 certain persons to accept or receive certain wagers under certain circumstances from a
11 misdemeanor to a gross misdemeanor.
