5 summons or complaint, or any other process, by which an action or proceeding is
6 commenced, with certain exceptions; (2) from $5 to $26 the fee for taking a bond
7 or undertaking; (3) from $2 to $3 the fee for each mile necessarily and actually
8 traveled in going to serve a notice required by law before the commencement of a
9 proceeding for any type of eviction; (4) from $21 to $40 the fee for each service in
10 a summary eviction, with certain exceptions, and for the service and execution of a
11 writ of restitution; (5) from $15 to $26 fees relating to the service of subpoenas and
12 the service or execution of certain documents or orders; (6) from $5 to $16 the fee
13 for issuing each certificate of sale of property on execution or order of sale and for
14 recording the original certificate with the county recorder; and (7) from $20 to $26
15 the fee for drawing and executing every sheriff’s deed. Section 2 of this bill
16 similarly increases such fees for constables and additionally increases from $7 to
17 $16 the fee that a constable is authorized to charge for summoning a jury before a
18 justice of the peace.
