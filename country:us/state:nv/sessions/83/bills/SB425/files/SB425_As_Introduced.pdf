77 enter into contracts on behalf of the Board. Section 25 of this bill exempts the
78 Board from certain requirements relating to financial records and legislative audits
79 that normally apply to professional licensing boards because the Board will not be
80 responsible for its own finances. Sections 38-42 of this bill instead subject the
81 actions taken by the Director pursuant to sections 68 and 69 to requirements
82 governing state employment and budgeting that apply to state agencies generally.

89 129 of this bill make various conforming changes to ensure that: (1) the Board
90 assumes the powers and duties of the licensing boards eliminated by section 146
91 and is otherwise treated similarly to those licensing boards; and (2) the legal status
92 of behavioral health professionals is not changed by this bill. Sections 23, 36, 37,
93 104, 109, 113, 114, 118, 120, 122, 125 and 146 of this bill make additional
94 conforming changes to remove: (1) references to the eliminated boards from
95 sections that are not applicable to the Board; and (2) provisions that are duplicative
96 of sections 63-70 or are no longer applicable. Sections 103, 105, 107, 112, 117 and
97 124 of this bill make conforming changes to clarify the applicability of certain
98 provisions of existing law. Section 130 of this bill requires the Director to: (1)
99 collaborate with the Board when performing certain duties relating to the health
100 care workforce; and (2) provide support to the Board.
101 Section 137 of this bill requires the Division to: (1) develop a plan for
102 transferring the duties of the licensing boards eliminated by section 146 to the
103 Board; (2) present and adopt the plan at separate public meetings; and (3) notify

11 obstetrical services.
12 [2.] (b) Provide money to Nevada Health Centers, Inc., or its
13 successor, to expand the clinical prenatal and obstetrical practice
14 base of community health center clinics and to provide uninsured,
15 underinsured and Medicaid patients with increased access to clinical
16 prenatal and obstetrical care.
17 [3.] (c) Establish a fund that allows practicing community
18 providers of prenatal care that are participating in the obstetrical

21 because of their financial status.
22 [4.] (d) Develop a database of clinical practitioners providing
23 prenatal or obstetrical services throughout the State to monitor and
