5 of collective bargaining between a recognized employee organization and a local
6 government employer, insurance benefits include, without limitation, insurance
7 benefits for the dependent of a local government employee.

6 subsection 2 with the designated representatives of the recognized
7 employee organization, if any, for each appropriate bargaining unit

39 void.
40 11. The board of trustees of a school district or the governing
41 body of a charter school or university school for profoundly gifted

43 child or a violation of NRS 201.540, 201.553, 201.560, 392.4633 or

6 assignment, discipline or termination of an employee. Any provision

10 require, the local government employer to negotiate subject matters
11 enumerated in subsection 3 which are outside the scope of
12 mandatory bargaining. The local government employer shall discuss
13 subject matters outside the scope of mandatory bargaining but it is
14 not required to negotiate those matters.

16 agreements as of May 15, 1975, at 12 p.m. remain negotiable.

19 Sec. 2. The amendatory provisions of this act do not apply to a
20 collective bargaining agreement entered into before October 1,
21 2025.
