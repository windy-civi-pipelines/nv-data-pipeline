the provisions of this section, recognize and declare the ultimate
right and responsibility of the local government employer to manage
its operation in the most efficient manner consistent with the best
interests of all its citizens, its taxpayers and its employees.
8. If the sponsor of a charter school reconstitutes the governing
body of a charter school pursuant to NRS 388A.330, the new

chapter which differs from or conflicts in any way with the

trustees of a school district or the principal of a school for taking
any action authorized pursuant to subsection 9 is unenforceable and
void.
11. The board of trustees of a school district or the governing
body of a charter school or university school for profoundly gifted

of any agreement negotiated pursuant to this chapter which conflicts
with the provisions of this subsection is unenforceable and void.
12. This section does not preclude, but this chapter does not
require, the local government employer to negotiate subject matters
enumerated in subsection 3 which are outside the scope of
mandatory bargaining. The local government employer shall discuss
subject matters outside the scope of mandatory bargaining but it is
not required to negotiate those matters.
