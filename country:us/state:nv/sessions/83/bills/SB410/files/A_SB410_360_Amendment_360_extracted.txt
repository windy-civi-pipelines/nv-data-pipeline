24 situations of emergency such as a riot, military action, natural disaster or civil
25 disorder. Those actions may include the suspension of any collective bargaining
26 agreement for the duration of the emergency.
27  Any action taken under the provisions of this subsection must not be construed
28 as a failure to negotiate in good faith.
29 7. The provisions of this chapter, including, without limitation, the provisions

47 consequences on the board of trustees of a school district or the principal of a
48 school for taking any action authorized pursuant to subsection 9 is unenforceable
49 and void.
50 11. The board of trustees of a school district or the governing body of a
51 charter school or university school for profoundly gifted pupils may use a
52 substantiated report of the abuse or neglect of a child or a violation of NRS
53 201.540, 201.553, 201.560, 392.4633 or 394.366 obtained from the Statewide

5 may include, without limitation, making a determination concerning the
6 assignment, discipline or termination of an employee. Any provision of any
7 agreement negotiated pursuant to this chapter which conflicts with the provisions of
8 this subsection is unenforceable and void.

10 government employer to negotiate subject matters enumerated in subsection 3
11 which are outside the scope of mandatory bargaining. The local government
12 employer shall discuss subject matters outside the scope of mandatory bargaining
13 but it is not required to negotiate those matters.
