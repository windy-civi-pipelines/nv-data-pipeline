13 county (currently the cities of Reno and Sparks) to, by interlocal agreement,

16 incorporated city in the county and any incorporated territory within an

20 commissioners composed of two members of the board of county commissioners

47 paying the debt.

49 of the district to a district organized pursuant to section 2.
50 Section 13 of this bill requires an owner of lands within the district to eliminate
51 and remove fire hazards on the owner’s property if directed to do so by the board.

28 whose boundaries are proposed to be adjusted.
29  For the purposes of this subsection, an owner of property located
30 within a fire protection district is “directly affected” by a proposed
31 adjustment of boundaries if the adjustment will cause that property,

10 clerk of the board and filed immediately for record in the office of
11 the county recorder.
12 6. If an adjustment of boundaries pursuant to this section
13 causes:
14 (a) Part of the area of one fire protection district to be excluded
15 from that district and added to the area of another fire protection
16 district, the districts may, but are not required to, enter into such an
17 agreement as they determine equitable to address the apportionment
18 of debts, obligations, liabilities and assets.
19 (b) All of the area of one fire protection district to be excluded
20 from that district and added to the area of another fire protection
21 district, the debts, obligations, liabilities and assets of the district
22 from which the area is excluded must be assumed by the district to
23 which the area is added.
24 Sec. 13. NRS 474.580 is hereby amended to read as follows:
25 474.580 1. Any owner of lands within a fire protection
26 district created pursuant to this chapter shall eliminate and remove a
27 fire hazard on the owner’s property when directed to do so by the
28 board.

30 the board, the board may eliminate and remove the fire hazard in the
31 manner permitted by NRS 474.160 or 474.470 [,] or section 3 of
32 this act, whichever applies, and may for this purpose contract with
33 any person for the performance of the work.
34 3. The cost incurred by the district in eliminating and removing
35 the fire hazard may be recovered directly from the owner of the
36 property or the district may make the cost a special assessment
37 against the real property. The special assessment may be collected at
38 the same time and in the same manner as ordinary county taxes are
39 collected, and is subject to the same penalties and the same
40 procedure and sale in case of delinquency as provided for ordinary
41 county taxes. All laws applicable to the collection and enforcement
42 of county taxes are applicable to the special assessment.
43 4. As used in this section, “board” means the board of directors
44 or the board of fire commissioners of the district, as the case may
45 be.
