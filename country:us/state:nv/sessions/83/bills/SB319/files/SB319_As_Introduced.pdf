42 causes:
43 (a) Part of the area of one fire protection district to be excluded
44 from that district and added to the area of another fire protection
45 district, the districts may, but are not required to, enter into such an
-
*SB319*

– 9 –
1 agreement as they determine equitable to address the apportionment
2 of debts, obligations, liabilities and assets.
3 (b) All of the area of one fire protection district to be excluded
4 from that district and added to the area of another fire protection
5 district, the debts, obligations, liabilities and assets of the district
6 from which the area is excluded must be assumed by the district to
7 which the area is added.

17 any person for the performance of the work.
18 3. The cost incurred by the district in eliminating and removing
19 the fire hazard may be recovered directly from the owner of the
20 property or the district may make the cost a special assessment
21 against the real property. The special assessment may be collected at
22 the same time and in the same manner as ordinary county taxes are
23 collected, and is subject to the same penalties and the same
24 procedure and sale in case of delinquency as provided for ordinary
25 county taxes. All laws applicable to the collection and enforcement
26 of county taxes are applicable to the special assessment.
27 4. As used in this section, “board” means the board of directors
28 or the board of fire commissioners of the district, as the case may
29 be.
