18 district and added to the area of another fire protection district, the districts may,
19 but are not required to, enter into such an agreement as they determine equitable to
20 address the apportionment of debts, obligations, liabilities and assets.

22 district and added to the area of another fire protection district, the debts,
23 obligations, liabilities and assets of the district from which the area is excluded

36 make the cost a special assessment against the real property. The special assessment
37 may be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary county taxes
38 are collected, and is subject to the same penalties and the same procedure and sale
39 in case of delinquency as provided for ordinary county taxes. All laws applicable to
40 the collection and enforcement of county taxes are applicable to the special

17 district organized pursuant to section 2 of this act must be audited, allowed and
18 paid by the board of fire commissioners established pursuant to section 2 of this
19 act by warrants drawn on the county treasurer or the treasurer of the district. The
20 county treasurer or, if authorized by the board of county commissioners and the
21 board of fire commissioners, the treasurer of the district shall pay them in the
22 order in which they are presented.] (Deleted by amendment.)
23 Sec. 11. [If a county fire protection district organized pursuant to section 2
24 of this act is dissolved by interlocal agreement and at the time of the dissolution,
25 there are any outstanding or bonded indebtedness of the district, then taxes for
26 the payment of such bonds or other indebtedness must be levied and collected the
27 same as if the district had not been dissolved and disincorporated, but for all
28 other purposes the district shall be deemed dissolved from the time of the filing of
29 the copy of the interlocal agreement with the clerk of the board of county
30 commissioners and the recording of the copy of such entry with the county
31 recorder.] (Deleted by amendment.)
32 Sec. 12. [NRS 474.565 is hereby amended to read as follows:
33 474.565 1. The boundaries of two or more contiguous fire protection
34 districts located within a county and organized pursuant to NRS 474.010 to
35 474.450, inclusive, 474.460 or 474.533 or section 2 of this act may be adjusted in
36 the manner provided in this section so that all or any part of the area of one such
37 fire protection district is excluded from that district and added to the area of another
38 such fire protection district.
39 2. The adjustment of the boundaries of fire protection districts pursuant to this
40 section must be approved by:
41 (a) A majority of the owners of property located within the portions of those
42 districts directly affected by the proposed adjustment of boundaries; and
43 (b) Resolution of the board of county commissioners of the county in which
44 the districts are located, which resolution must also be approved by the governing
45 bodies of the fire protection districts whose boundaries are proposed to be adjusted.
46  For the purposes of this subsection, an owner of property located within a fire
47 protection district is “directly affected” by a proposed adjustment of boundaries if
48 the adjustment will cause that property, or other property immediately adjacent to
49 that property, to be excluded from the district in which it is currently located and
50 added to a district other than that in which it is currently located.
51 3. If, after notice and a hearing, the board of county commissioners
52 determines that the proposed adjustment of boundaries is feasible and in the best
53 interests of the county and the districts whose boundaries are proposed to be

Senate Amendment No. 547 to Senate Bill No. 319 First Reprint Page 9
1 adjusted, the board of county commissioners shall adopt an ordinance adjusting the
2 boundaries of those districts. The ordinance must include the name and boundaries
3 of each district that will result from the adjustment.
4 4. For the purposes of subsection 3, a board of county commissioners shall
5 not determine that a proposed adjustment of boundaries is feasible and in the best
6 interests of the county and the districts whose boundaries are proposed to be
7 adjusted unless the board concludes, after conducting a reasonable investigation,
8 that:
9 (a) The total assessed valuation of taxable property in the districts whose
10 boundaries are proposed to be adjusted is substantially equivalent; and
11 (b) The total ad valorem tax levied within the districts whose boundaries are
12 proposed to be adjusted is substantially equivalent.
13 5. The board of county commissioners shall cause a copy of any ordinance
14 adopted pursuant to subsection 3 to be certified by the clerk of the board and filed
15 immediately for record in the office of the county recorder.
16 6. If an adjustment of boundaries pursuant to this section causes:
17 (a) Part of the area of one fire protection district to be excluded from that
18 district and added to the area of another fire protection district, the districts may,
19 but are not required to, enter into such an agreement as they determine equitable to
20 address the apportionment of debts, obligations, liabilities and assets.
21 (b) All of the area of one fire protection district to be excluded from that
22 district and added to the area of another fire protection district, the debts,
23 obligations, liabilities and assets of the district from which the area is excluded
24 must be assumed by the district to which the area is added.] (Deleted by
25 amendment.)
26 Sec. 13. [NRS 474.580 is hereby amended to read as follows:
27 474.580 1. Any owner of lands within a fire protection district created
28 pursuant to this chapter shall eliminate and remove a fire hazard on the owner’s
29 property when directed to do so by the board.
30 2. If the owner does not comply within the time specified by the board, the
31 board may eliminate and remove the fire hazard in the manner permitted by NRS
32 474.160 or 474.470 [,] or section 3 of this act, whichever applies, and may for this
33 purpose contract with any person for the performance of the work.
34 3. The cost incurred by the district in eliminating and removing the fire
35 hazard may be recovered directly from the owner of the property or the district may
36 make the cost a special assessment against the real property. The special assessment
37 may be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary county taxes
38 are collected, and is subject to the same penalties and the same procedure and sale
39 in case of delinquency as provided for ordinary county taxes. All laws applicable to
40 the collection and enforcement of county taxes are applicable to the special
41 assessment.
42 4. As used in this section, “board” means the board of directors or the board
43 of fire commissioners of the district, as the case may be.] (Deleted by
44 amendment.)
