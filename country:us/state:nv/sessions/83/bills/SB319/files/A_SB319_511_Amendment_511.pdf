4 protection district. (NRS 474.010-474.125) Existing law also authorizes a board of county
5 commissioners to, by ordinance, organize unincorporated territory within the county into a
6 county fire protection district. (NRS 474.460) Existing law further authorizes a board of
7 county commissioners in a county whose population is less than 700,000 (currently all
8 counties other than Clark County) to consolidate two or more county fire protection districts
9 within the county under certain circumstances. (NRS 474.533) Section 2 of this bill authorizes
10 the governing body of a county whose population is 100,000 or more but less than 700,000
11 (currently only Washoe County) and each incorporated city within such a county (currently
12 the cities of Reno and Sparks) to, by interlocal agreement, consolidate any contiguous
13 unincorporated territory within the county , any noncontiguous unincorporated territory
14 which is surrounded by the territory of an incorporated city in the county and any
15 incorporated territory within [the cities] an incorporated city into a county fire protection
16 district. Section 2 requires: (1) the interlocal agreement to establish the boundaries of the
17 county fire protection district; and (2) the county fire protection district to be governed by a
18 board of fire commissioners composed of two members of the board of county commissioners
19 and two members from each of the governing bodies of each participating city. Section 2
20 further requires that any action of the board of fire commissioners must be approved by a

29 2. The adjustment of the boundaries of fire protection districts pursuant to this
30 section must be approved by:
31 (a) A majority of the owners of property located within the portions of those
32 districts directly affected by the proposed adjustment of boundaries; and

35 bodies of the fire protection districts whose boundaries are proposed to be adjusted.
36  For the purposes of this subsection, an owner of property located within a fire
37 protection district is “directly affected” by a proposed adjustment of boundaries if
38 the adjustment will cause that property, or other property immediately adjacent to
39 that property, to be excluded from the district in which it is currently located and
40 added to a district other than that in which it is currently located.
41 3. If, after notice and a hearing, the board of county commissioners

53 boundaries are proposed to be adjusted is substantially equivalent; and

1 (b) The total ad valorem tax levied within the districts whose boundaries are
2 proposed to be adjusted is substantially equivalent.
3 5. The board of county commissioners shall cause a copy of any ordinance
4 adopted pursuant to subsection 3 to be certified by the clerk of the board and filed
5 immediately for record in the office of the county recorder.
6 6. If an adjustment of boundaries pursuant to this section causes:
7 (a) Part of the area of one fire protection district to be excluded from that
8 district and added to the area of another fire protection district, the districts may,
9 but are not required to, enter into such an agreement as they determine equitable to
10 address the apportionment of debts, obligations, liabilities and assets.
11 (b) All of the area of one fire protection district to be excluded from that
12 district and added to the area of another fire protection district, the debts,
13 obligations, liabilities and assets of the district from which the area is excluded
14 must be assumed by the district to which the area is added.
15 Sec. 13. NRS 474.580 is hereby amended to read as follows:
16 474.580 1. Any owner of lands within a fire protection district created
17 pursuant to this chapter shall eliminate and remove a fire hazard on the owner’s
18 property when directed to do so by the board.

20 board may eliminate and remove the fire hazard in the manner permitted by NRS
21 474.160 or 474.470 [,] or section 3 of this act, whichever applies, and may for this
22 purpose contract with any person for the performance of the work.
23 3. The cost incurred by the district in eliminating and removing the fire
24 hazard may be recovered directly from the owner of the property or the district may
25 make the cost a special assessment against the real property. The special assessment
26 may be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary county taxes
27 are collected, and is subject to the same penalties and the same procedure and sale
28 in case of delinquency as provided for ordinary county taxes. All laws applicable to
29 the collection and enforcement of county taxes are applicable to the special
30 assessment.
31 4. As used in this section, “board” means the board of directors or the board
32 of fire commissioners of the district, as the case may be.
33 Sec. 14. Section 1.090 of the Charter of the City of Reno, being chapter 662,
