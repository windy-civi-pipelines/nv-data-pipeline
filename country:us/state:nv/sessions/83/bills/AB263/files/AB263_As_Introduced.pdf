Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes a board of county commissioners, with certain
2 exceptions, to exercise all powers: (1) expressly granted to the board; (2)
3 necessarily or fairly implied in or incident to the powers expressly granted to the
4 board; and (3) necessary or proper to address any matter that primarily affects
5 matters of local concern for the effective operation of the county government. (NRS
6 244.146) Under existing law, a board of county commissioners may by ordinance
7 create a regional transportation commission if a streets and highway plan has been
8 adopted as a part of the master plan by the county or regional planning commission.
9 (NRS 277A.170) The Regional Transportation Commission Act establishes various
10 duties and general and special powers relating to a commission, including
11 authorizing a commission to exercise powers as are necessary. (NRS 277A.200-
12 277A.380) Existing law establishes the Nevada Interagency Advisory Council on
13 Homelessness to Housing and requires the Council, among certain other duties, to:
14 (1) collaborate with state and local agencies on their responses to homelessness and
15 promote cooperation among federal, state and local agencies to address
16 homelessness; and (2) develop a strategic plan for addressing homelessness in this
17 State. (NRS 232.4983)
18 This bill requires the board of county commissioners of each county whose
19 population is 700,000 or more (currently only Clark County) to establish homeless
20 outreach teams to provide support to homeless persons near schools, parks and
21 senior housing in areas of the county in which pervasive poverty, unemployment or

23 develop a plan in collaboration with and request assistance from the regional
24 transportation commission for outreach and clean-ups related to homeless persons
25 for public highways or public rights-of-way located in areas of the county in which
26 pervasive poverty, unemployment or economic distress exist. Finally, this bill
27 requires each homeless outreach team to collaborate and consult with the Nevada
28 Interagency Advisory Council on Homelessness to Housing.
