EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to governmental administration; requiring certain persons who
qualify for certain preferences in bidding on a public work to
certify, under certain conditions, that the persons will ensure that
any nonstandard good or material procured for the public work is
custom fabricated in this State; requiring the payment of prevailing
wages to workers who perform custom fabrication on a public work or
for certain performance contracts of local governments or state
agencies; requiring the payment of prevailing wages to workers who
perform custom fabrication on any project financed or otherwise
undertaken by the Tahoe-Douglas Visitor’s Authority; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, every contract to which a public body of this State is a party,
2 requiring the employment of skilled mechanics, skilled workers, semiskilled mechanics,
3 semiskilled workers or unskilled labor in the performance of a public work, must contain in
4 express terms the hourly and daily rate of wages to be paid to each of the classes of mechanics
5 and workers. The hourly and daily rate of wages must not be less than the prevailing wage in
6 the region in which the public work is located, as determined by the Labor Commissioner.
7 (NRS 338.020) Section 2 of this bill provides that workers who perform custom fabrication
8 on a public work must also be paid such a prevailing wage. Section 1 of this bill: (1) defines
9 the term “custom fabrication”; (2) defines the term “nonstandard good or material”; and (3)
10 revises the definition of “worker” to include a worker who performs custom fabrication.
11 Under existing law, performance contracts for certain operating cost-savings measures
12 entered into by local governments and state agencies must contain in express terms the hourly
13 and daily rate of wages to be paid to each class of mechanics and workers. Such wages must
14 not be less than the prevailing wage in the region in which the local government or state
15 agency is located. (NRS 332.390, 333A.120) Similar to section 1, sections 3 and 4 of this
16 bill, respectively, provide that workers who perform custom fabrication must also be paid
17 such a prevailing wage.
18 The Tahoe-Douglas Visitor’s Authority Act requires the payment of prevailing wages on
19 any project financed or otherwise undertaken by the Tahoe-Douglas Visitor’s Authority that
Assembly Amendment No. 279 to Assembly Bill No. 213 Page 4
20 requires the employment of certain workers even if the project does not qualify as a public
21 work. (Section 33 of chapter 375, Statutes of Nevada 2019, at page 2364) Section 5 of this bill
22 provides that workers who perform custom fabrication on such a project must also be paid
23 prevailing wages.
24 Section 6 of this bill provides that the requirement to pay prevailing wage to workers who
25 perform custom fabrication does not apply to a public works contract or performance contract
26 awarded before January 1, 2026.
27 Existing law provides that as a condition of receiving certain preferences in bidding
28 on a public work, a contractor, an applicant or a design-build team is required to submit
29 to the public body sponsoring or financing the public work, a signed affidavit which
30 makes certain certifications. (NRS 338.0117) Section 1.5 of this bill requires an
31 additional certification that if the public work requires the procurement of any
32 nonstandard good or material and is located in a county whose population is 100,000 or
33 more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties), the contractor, applicant or design-build
34 team and any subcontractor engaged on the public work will: (1) ensure that each
35 nonstandard good or material is custom fabricated in this State; and (2) maintain and
36 make available for inspection certain records concerning each nonstandard good or
37 material procured for the public work. Sections 2.3 and 2.7 of this bill make conforming
38 changes to refer to provisions that have been renumbered in section 1.5.

FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
CONTAINS UNFUNDED MANDATE [(§§ 2-5)] (§§ 2, 3-5)
(NOT REQUESTED BY AFFECTED LOCAL GOVERNMENT)
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to governmental administration; requiring certain persons who
qualify for certain preferences in bidding on a public work to
certify, under certain conditions, that the persons will ensure that
any nonstandard good or material procured for the public work is
custom fabricated in this State; requiring the payment of prevailing
wages to workers who perform custom fabrication on a public work or
for certain performance contracts of local governments or state
agencies; requiring the payment of prevailing wages to workers who
perform custom fabrication on any project financed or otherwise
undertaken by the Tahoe-Douglas Visitor’s Authority; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, every contract to which a public body of this State is a party,
2 requiring the employment of skilled mechanics, skilled workers, semiskilled mechanics,
3 semiskilled workers or unskilled labor in the performance of a public work, must contain in
4 express terms the hourly and daily rate of wages to be paid to each of the classes of mechanics
5 and workers. The hourly and daily rate of wages must not be less than the prevailing wage in
6 the region in which the public work is located, as determined by the Labor Commissioner.
7 (NRS 338.020) Section 2 of this bill provides that workers who perform custom fabrication
8 on a public work must also be paid such a prevailing wage. Section 1 of this bill: (1) defines
9 the term “custom fabrication”; (2) defines the term “nonstandard good or material”; and (3)
10 revises the definition of “worker” to include a worker who performs custom fabrication.
11 Under existing law, performance contracts for certain operating cost-savings measures
12 entered into by local governments and state agencies must contain in express terms the hourly
13 and daily rate of wages to be paid to each class of mechanics and workers. Such wages must
14 not be less than the prevailing wage in the region in which the local government or state
15 agency is located. (NRS 332.390, 333A.120) Similar to section 1, sections 3 and 4 of this
16 bill, respectively, provide that workers who perform custom fabrication must also be paid
17 such a prevailing wage.
18 The Tahoe-Douglas Visitor’s Authority Act requires the payment of prevailing wages on
19 any project financed or otherwise undertaken by the Tahoe-Douglas Visitor’s Authority that

Assembly Amendment No. 279 to Assembly Bill No. 213 Page 4
20 requires the employment of certain workers even if the project does not qualify as a public
21 work. (Section 33 of chapter 375, Statutes of Nevada 2019, at page 2364) Section 5 of this bill
22 provides that workers who perform custom fabrication on such a project must also be paid
23 prevailing wages.
24 Section 6 of this bill provides that the requirement to pay prevailing wage to workers who
25 perform custom fabrication does not apply to a public works contract or performance contract
26 awarded before January 1, 2026.
27 Existing law provides that as a condition of receiving certain preferences in bidding
28 on a public work, a contractor, an applicant or a design-build team is required to submit
29 to the public body sponsoring or financing the public work, a signed affidavit which
30 makes certain certifications. (NRS 338.0117) Section 1.5 of this bill requires an
31 additional certification that if the public work requires the procurement of any
32 nonstandard good or material and is located in a county whose population is 100,000 or
33 more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties), the contractor, applicant or design-build
34 team and any subcontractor engaged on the public work will: (1) ensure that each
35 nonstandard good or material is custom fabricated in this State; and (2) maintain and
36 make available for inspection certain records concerning each nonstandard good or
37 material procured for the public work. Sections 2.3 and 2.7 of this bill make conforming
38 changes to refer to provisions that have been renumbered in section 1.5.

31 7. A contractor who fails to submit an affidavit to the Board pursuant to
32 subsection 6 ceases to be eligible to receive a preference in bidding on public works
33 unless the contractor reapplies for and receives a certificate of eligibility pursuant to
34 subsection 3 or 4, as applicable.
35 8. If a contractor holds more than one contractor’s license, the contractor must
36 submit a separate application for each license pursuant to which the contractor
37 wishes to qualify for a preference in bidding. Upon issuance, the certificate of
38 eligibility to receive a preference in bidding on public works becomes part of the
39 contractor’s license for which the contractor submitted the application.

43 taxes, the contractor is not eligible to receive a preference in bidding on public
44 works for a period of 5 years after the date on which the Board becomes aware of
45 the submission of the false information; or
46 (b) Is found by the Board to have, within the preceding 5 years, materially
47 breached a contract for a public work for which the cost exceeds $5,000,000, the
48 contractor is not eligible to receive a preference in bidding on public works.
49 10. If any federal statute or regulation precludes the granting of federal
50 assistance or reduces the amount of that assistance for a particular public work
51 because of the provisions of subsection 2, those provisions do not apply insofar as
52 their application would preclude or reduce federal assistance for that work.

1 11. If a bid is submitted by two or more contractors as a joint venture or by
2 one of them as a joint venturer, the bid may receive a preference in bidding only if
3 both or all of the joint venturers separately meet the requirements of subsection 2.
4 12. The State Contractors’ Board shall adopt regulations and may assess
5 reasonable fees relating to the certification of contractors for a preference in
6 bidding on public works.
7 13. A person who submitted a bid on the public work or an entity who
8 believes that the contractor who was awarded the contract for the public work
9 wrongfully holds a certificate of eligibility to receive a preference in bidding on
10 public works may challenge the validity of the certificate by filing a written
11 objection with the local government to which the contractor has submitted a bid on
12 a contract for the construction of a public work. A written objection authorized
13 pursuant to this subsection must:
14 (a) Set forth proof or substantiating evidence to support the belief of the person
15 or entity that the contractor wrongfully holds a certificate of eligibility to receive a
16 preference in bidding on public works; and

18 opening of the bids by the local government or its authorized representative.
19 14. If a local government receives a written objection pursuant to subsection
20 13, the local government shall determine whether the objection is accompanied by
21 the proof or substantiating evidence required pursuant to paragraph (a) of that
22 subsection. If the local government determines that the objection is not
23 accompanied by the required proof or substantiating evidence, the local government
24 shall dismiss the objection and the local government or its authorized representative
25 may proceed immediately to award the contract. If the local government determines
26 that the objection is accompanied by the required proof or substantiating evidence,
27 the local government shall determine whether the contractor qualifies for the
28 certificate pursuant to the provisions of this section and the local government or its
29 authorized representative may proceed to award the contract accordingly.
