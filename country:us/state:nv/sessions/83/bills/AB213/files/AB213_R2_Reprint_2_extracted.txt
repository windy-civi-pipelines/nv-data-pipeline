~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to governmental administration; requiring certain
persons who qualify for certain preferences in bidding on
a public work to certify, under certain conditions, that the
persons will ensure that any nonstandard good or material
procured for the public work is custom fabricated in this
State; requiring the payment of prevailing wages to
workers who perform custom fabrication on a public work
or for certain performance contracts of local governments
or state agencies; requiring the payment of prevailing
wages to workers who perform custom fabrication on any
project financed or otherwise undertaken by the Tahoe-
Douglas Visitor’s Authority; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, every contract to which a public body of this State is a
2 party, requiring the employment of skilled mechanics, skilled workers, semiskilled
3 mechanics, semiskilled workers or unskilled labor in the performance of a public
4 work, must contain in express terms the hourly and daily rate of wages to be paid to
5 each of the classes of mechanics and workers. The hourly and daily rate of wages
6 must not be less than the prevailing wage in the region in which the public work is
7 located, as determined by the Labor Commissioner. (NRS 338.020) Section 2 of
8 this bill provides that workers who perform custom fabrication on a public work
9 must also be paid such a prevailing wage. Section 2.2 of this bill provides that
10 workers who perform custom fabrication for a public work are deemed to be
-
*AB213_R2*
– 2 –
11 employed on the public work regardless of the location at which the custom
12 fabrication is performed.
13 Section 1 of this bill: (1) defines the term “custom fabrication”; (2) defines the
14 term “nonstandard good or material”; and (3) revises the definition of “worker” to
15 include a worker who performs custom fabrication.
16 Under existing law, performance contracts for certain operating cost-savings
17 measures entered into by local governments and state agencies must contain in
18 express terms the hourly and daily rate of wages to be paid to each class of
19 mechanics and workers. Such wages must not be less than the prevailing wage in
20 the region in which the local government or state agency is located. (NRS 332.390,
21 333A.120) Similar to section 1, sections 3 and 4 of this bill, respectively, provide
22 that workers who perform custom fabrication must also be paid such a prevailing
23 wage.
24 The Tahoe-Douglas Visitor’s Authority Act requires the payment of prevailing
25 wages on any project financed or otherwise undertaken by the Tahoe-Douglas
26 Visitor’s Authority that requires the employment of certain workers even if the
27 project does not qualify as a public work. (Section 33 of chapter 375, Statutes of
28 Nevada 2019, at page 2364) Section 5 of this bill provides that workers who
29 perform custom fabrication on such a project must also be paid prevailing wages.
30 Section 6 of this bill provides that the requirement to pay prevailing wage to
31 workers who perform custom fabrication does not apply to a public works contract
32 or performance contract awarded before January 1, 2026.
33 Existing law provides that as a condition of receiving certain preferences in
34 bidding on a public work, a contractor, an applicant or a design-build team is
35 required to submit to the public body sponsoring or financing the public work, a
36 signed affidavit which makes certain certifications. (NRS 338.0117) Section 1.5 of
37 this bill requires an additional certification that if the public work requires the
38 procurement of any nonstandard good or material and is located in a county whose
39 population is 100,000 or more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties), the
40 contractor, applicant or design-build team and any subcontractor engaged on the
41 public work will: (1) ensure that each nonstandard good or material is custom
42 fabricated in this State; and (2) maintain and make available for inspection certain
43 records concerning each nonstandard good or material procured for the public
44 work. Sections 2.3 and 2.7 of this bill make conforming changes to refer to
45 provisions that have been renumbered in section 1.5.

(Reprinted with amendments adopted on May 21, 2025)
SECOND REPRINT A.B. 213
ASSEMBLY BILL NO. 213–ASSEMBLYMEMBER MONROE-MORENO
PREFILED FEBRUARY 3, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Government Affairs
SUMMARY—Revises provisions governing public works projects.
(BDR 28-816)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
CONTAINS UNFUNDED MANDATE (§§ 2, 3-5)
(NOT REQUESTED BY AFFECTED LOCAL GOVERNMENT)
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to governmental administration; requiring certain
persons who qualify for certain preferences in bidding on
a public work to certify, under certain conditions, that the
persons will ensure that any nonstandard good or material
procured for the public work is custom fabricated in this
State; requiring the payment of prevailing wages to
workers who perform custom fabrication on a public work
or for certain performance contracts of local governments
or state agencies; requiring the payment of prevailing
wages to workers who perform custom fabrication on any
project financed or otherwise undertaken by the Tahoe-
Douglas Visitor’s Authority; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, every contract to which a public body of this State is a
2 party, requiring the employment of skilled mechanics, skilled workers, semiskilled
3 mechanics, semiskilled workers or unskilled labor in the performance of a public
4 work, must contain in express terms the hourly and daily rate of wages to be paid to
5 each of the classes of mechanics and workers. The hourly and daily rate of wages
6 must not be less than the prevailing wage in the region in which the public work is
7 located, as determined by the Labor Commissioner. (NRS 338.020) Section 2 of
8 this bill provides that workers who perform custom fabrication on a public work
9 must also be paid such a prevailing wage. Section 2.2 of this bill provides that
10 workers who perform custom fabrication for a public work are deemed to be
-
*AB213_R2*

– 2 –
11 employed on the public work regardless of the location at which the custom
12 fabrication is performed.
13 Section 1 of this bill: (1) defines the term “custom fabrication”; (2) defines the
14 term “nonstandard good or material”; and (3) revises the definition of “worker” to
15 include a worker who performs custom fabrication.
16 Under existing law, performance contracts for certain operating cost-savings
17 measures entered into by local governments and state agencies must contain in
18 express terms the hourly and daily rate of wages to be paid to each class of
19 mechanics and workers. Such wages must not be less than the prevailing wage in
20 the region in which the local government or state agency is located. (NRS 332.390,
21 333A.120) Similar to section 1, sections 3 and 4 of this bill, respectively, provide
22 that workers who perform custom fabrication must also be paid such a prevailing
23 wage.
24 The Tahoe-Douglas Visitor’s Authority Act requires the payment of prevailing
25 wages on any project financed or otherwise undertaken by the Tahoe-Douglas
26 Visitor’s Authority that requires the employment of certain workers even if the
27 project does not qualify as a public work. (Section 33 of chapter 375, Statutes of
28 Nevada 2019, at page 2364) Section 5 of this bill provides that workers who
29 perform custom fabrication on such a project must also be paid prevailing wages.
30 Section 6 of this bill provides that the requirement to pay prevailing wage to
31 workers who perform custom fabrication does not apply to a public works contract
32 or performance contract awarded before January 1, 2026.
33 Existing law provides that as a condition of receiving certain preferences in
34 bidding on a public work, a contractor, an applicant or a design-build team is
35 required to submit to the public body sponsoring or financing the public work, a
36 signed affidavit which makes certain certifications. (NRS 338.0117) Section 1.5 of
37 this bill requires an additional certification that if the public work requires the
38 procurement of any nonstandard good or material and is located in a county whose
39 population is 100,000 or more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties), the
40 contractor, applicant or design-build team and any subcontractor engaged on the
41 public work will: (1) ensure that each nonstandard good or material is custom
42 fabricated in this State; and (2) maintain and make available for inspection certain
43 records concerning each nonstandard good or material procured for the public
44 work. Sections 2.3 and 2.7 of this bill make conforming changes to refer to
45 provisions that have been renumbered in section 1.5.

8 (2) Certificate of eligibility to receive a preference in bidding
9 on public works.
10 5. For the purposes of complying with the requirements set

12 subsection 4, a contractor shall be deemed to have paid:
13 (a) Sales and use taxes and governmental services taxes paid in
14 this State by an affiliate or parent company of the contractor, if the
15 affiliate or parent company is also a general contractor or specialty
16 contractor, as applicable; and
17 (b) Sales and use taxes paid in this State by a joint venture in
18 which the contractor is a participant, in proportion to the amount of
19 interest the contractor has in the joint venture.
20 6. A contractor who has received a certificate of eligibility to
21 receive a preference in bidding on public works from the State
22 Contractors’ Board pursuant to subsection 3 or 4 shall, at the time
23 for the renewal of his or her contractor’s license pursuant to NRS
24 624.283, submit to the Board an affidavit from a certified public
25 accountant setting forth that the contractor has, during the

28 applicable, to maintain eligibility to hold such a certificate.
29 7. A contractor who fails to submit an affidavit to the Board
30 pursuant to subsection 6 ceases to be eligible to receive a preference
31 in bidding on public works unless the contractor reapplies for and
32 receives a certificate of eligibility pursuant to subsection 3 or 4, as
33 applicable.
34 8. If a contractor holds more than one contractor’s license, the
35 contractor must submit a separate application for each license
36 pursuant to which the contractor wishes to qualify for a preference
37 in bidding. Upon issuance, the certificate of eligibility to receive a
38 preference in bidding on public works becomes part of the

5 materially breached a contract for a public work for which the cost
6 exceeds $5,000,000, the contractor is not eligible to receive a
7 preference in bidding on public works.
8 10. If any federal statute or regulation precludes the granting of
9 federal assistance or reduces the amount of that assistance for a
10 particular public work because of the provisions of subsection 2,
11 those provisions do not apply insofar as their application would
12 preclude or reduce federal assistance for that work.
13 11. If a bid is submitted by two or more contractors as a joint
14 venture or by one of them as a joint venturer, the bid may receive a
15 preference in bidding only if both or all of the joint venturers
16 separately meet the requirements of subsection 2.
17 12. The State Contractors’ Board shall adopt regulations and
18 may assess reasonable fees relating to the certification of contractors
19 for a preference in bidding on public works.

23 eligibility to receive a preference in bidding on public works may
24 challenge the validity of the certificate by filing a written objection
25 with the local government to which the contractor has submitted a
26 bid on a contract for the construction of a public work. A written
27 objection authorized pursuant to this subsection must:
28 (a) Set forth proof or substantiating evidence to support the

33 days after the opening of the bids by the local government or its

37 objection is accompanied by the proof or substantiating evidence
38 required pursuant to paragraph (a) of that subsection. If the local
39 government determines that the objection is not accompanied by the
40 required proof or substantiating evidence, the local government shall
41 dismiss the objection and the local government or its authorized
42 representative may proceed immediately to award the contract. If
43 the local government determines that the objection is accompanied
44 by the required proof or substantiating evidence, the local
45 government shall determine whether the contractor qualifies for the
