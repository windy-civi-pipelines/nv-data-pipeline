Section 1:
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to governmental administration; requiring certain
persons who qualify for certain preferences in bidding on a
public work to certify, under certain conditions, that the
persons will ensure that any nonstandard good or material
procured for the public work is custom fabricated in this
State; requiring the payment of prevailing wages to workers
who perform custom fabrication on a public work or for
certain performance contracts of local governments or state
agencies; requiring the payment of prevailing wages to
workers who perform custom fabrication on any project
financed or otherwise undertaken by the Tahoe-Douglas
Visitor’s Authority; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Under existing law, every contract to which a public body of this State is a
party, requiring the employment of skilled mechanics, skilled workers, semiskilled
mechanics, semiskilled workers or unskilled labor in the performance of a public
work, must contain in express terms the hourly and daily rate of wages to be paid to
each of the classes of mechanics and workers. The hourly and daily rate of wages
must not be less than the prevailing wage in the region in which the public work is
located, as determined by the Labor Commissioner. (NRS 338.020) Section 2 of
this bill provides that workers who perform custom fabrication on a public work
must also be paid such a prevailing wage. Section 2.2 of this bill provides that
workers who perform custom fabrication for a public work are deemed to be
employed on the public work regardless of the location at which the custom
fabrication is performed.

Section 2:
Section 1 of this bill: (1) defines the term “custom fabrication”; (2) defines the
term “nonstandard good or material”; and (3) revises the definition of “worker” to
include a worker who performs custom fabrication.
Under existing law, performance contracts for certain operating cost-savings
measures entered into by local governments and state agencies must contain in
express terms the hourly and daily rate of wages to be paid to each class of
mechanics and workers. Such wages must not be less than the prevailing wage in
the region in which the local government or state agency is located. (NRS 332.390,
333A.120) Similar to section 1, sections 3 and 4 of this bill, respectively, provide
that workers who perform custom fabrication must also be paid such a prevailing
wage.
The Tahoe-Douglas Visitor’s Authority Act requires the payment of prevailing
wages on any project financed or otherwise undertaken by the Tahoe-Douglas
Visitor’s Authority that requires the employment of certain workers even if the
project does not qualify as a public work. (Section 33 of chapter 375, Statutes of
Nevada 2019, at page 2364) Section 5 of this bill provides that workers who
perform custom fabrication on such a project must also be paid prevailing wages.

Section 3:
Section 6 of this bill provides that the requirement to pay prevailing wage to
workers who perform custom fabrication does not apply to a public works contract
or performance contract awarded before January 1, 2026.

Existing law provides that as a condition of receiving certain preferences in
bidding on a public work, a contractor, an applicant or a design-build team is
required to submit to the public body sponsoring or financing the public work, a
signed affidavit which makes certain certifications. (NRS 338.0117) Section 1.5 of
this bill requires an additional certification that if the public work requires the
procurement of any nonstandard good or material and is located in a county whose
population is 100,000 or more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties), the
contractor, applicant or design-build team and any subcontractor engaged on the
public work will: (1) ensure that each nonstandard good or material is custom
fabricated in this State; and (2) maintain and make available for inspection certain
records concerning each nonstandard good or material procured for the public
work. Sections 2.3 and 2.7 of this bill make conforming changes to refer to
provisions that have been renumbered in section 1.5.

Raw Text:
Assembly Bill No. 213–Assemblymember Monroe-Moreno
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to governmental administration; requiring certain
persons who qualify for certain preferences in bidding on a
public work to certify, under certain conditions, that the
persons will ensure that any nonstandard good or material
procured for the public work is custom fabricated in this
State; requiring the payment of prevailing wages to workers
who perform custom fabrication on a public work or for
certain performance contracts of local governments or state
agencies; requiring the payment of prevailing wages to
workers who perform custom fabrication on any project
financed or otherwise undertaken by the Tahoe-Douglas
Visitor’s Authority; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Under existing law, every contract to which a public body of this State is a
party, requiring the employment of skilled mechanics, skilled workers, semiskilled
mechanics, semiskilled workers or unskilled labor in the performance of a public
work, must contain in express terms the hourly and daily rate of wages to be paid to
each of the classes of mechanics and workers. The hourly and daily rate of wages
must not be less than the prevailing wage in the region in which the public work is
located, as determined by the Labor Commissioner. (NRS 338.020) Section 2 of
this bill provides that workers who perform custom fabrication on a public work
must also be paid such a prevailing wage. Section 2.2 of this bill provides that
workers who perform custom fabrication for a public work are deemed to be
employed on the public work regardless of the location at which the custom
fabrication is performed.
Section 1 of this bill: (1) defines the term “custom fabrication”; (2) defines the
term “nonstandard good or material”; and (3) revises the definition of “worker” to
include a worker who performs custom fabrication.
Under existing law, performance contracts for certain operating cost-savings
measures entered into by local governments and state agencies must contain in
express terms the hourly and daily rate of wages to be paid to each class of
mechanics and workers. Such wages must not be less than the prevailing wage in
the region in which the local government or state agency is located. (NRS 332.390,
333A.120) Similar to section 1, sections 3 and 4 of this bill, respectively, provide
that workers who perform custom fabrication must also be paid such a prevailing
wage.
The Tahoe-Douglas Visitor’s Authority Act requires the payment of prevailing
wages on any project financed or otherwise undertaken by the Tahoe-Douglas
Visitor’s Authority that requires the employment of certain workers even if the
project does not qualify as a public work. (Section 33 of chapter 375, Statutes of
Nevada 2019, at page 2364) Section 5 of this bill provides that workers who
perform custom fabrication on such a project must also be paid prevailing wages.
Section 6 of this bill provides that the requirement to pay prevailing wage to
workers who perform custom fabrication does not apply to a public works contract
or performance contract awarded before January 1, 2026.

Existing law provides that as a condition of receiving certain preferences in
bidding on a public work, a contractor, an applicant or a design-build team is
required to submit to the public body sponsoring or financing the public work, a
signed affidavit which makes certain certifications. (NRS 338.0117) Section 1.5 of
this bill requires an additional certification that if the public work requires the
procurement of any nonstandard good or material and is located in a county whose
population is 100,000 or more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties), the
contractor, applicant or design-build team and any subcontractor engaged on the
public work will: (1) ensure that each nonstandard good or material is custom
fabricated in this State; and (2) maintain and make available for inspection certain
records concerning each nonstandard good or material procured for the public
work. Sections 2.3 and 2.7 of this bill make conforming changes to refer to
provisions that have been renumbered in section 1.5.
