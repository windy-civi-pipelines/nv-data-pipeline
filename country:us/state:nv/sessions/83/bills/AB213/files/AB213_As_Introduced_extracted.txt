AN ACT relating to governmental administration; requiring the
payment of prevailing wages to workers who perform
custom fabrication on a public work or for certain
performance contracts of local governments or state
agencies; requiring the payment of prevailing wages to
workers who perform custom fabrication on any project
financed or otherwise undertaken by the Tahoe-Douglas
Visitor’s Authority; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, every contract to which a public body of this State is a
2 party, requiring the employment of skilled mechanics, skilled workers, semiskilled
3 mechanics, semiskilled workers or unskilled labor in the performance of a public
4 work, must contain in express terms the hourly and daily rate of wages to be paid to
5 each of the classes of mechanics and workers. The hourly and daily rate of wages
6 must not be less than the prevailing wage in the region in which the public work is
7 located, as determined by the Labor Commissioner. (NRS 338.020) Section 2 of
8 this bill provides that workers who perform custom fabrication on a public work
9 must also be paid such a prevailing wage. Section 1 of this bill: (1) defines the term
10 “custom fabrication”; (2) defines the term “nonstandard good or material”; and (3)
11 revises the definition of “worker” to include a worker who performs custom
12 fabrication.
13 Under existing law, performance contracts for certain operating cost-savings
14 measures entered into by local governments and state agencies must contain in
15 express terms the hourly and daily rate of wages to be paid to each class of
16 mechanics and workers. Such wages must not be less than the prevailing wage in
-
*AB213*
– 2 –
17 the region in which the local government or state agency is located. (NRS 332.390,
18 333A.120) Similar to section 1, sections 3 and 4 of this bill, respectively, provide
19 that workers who perform custom fabrication must also be paid such a prevailing
20 wage.
21 The Tahoe-Douglas Visitor’s Authority Act requires the payment of prevailing
22 wages on any project financed or otherwise undertaken by the Tahoe-Douglas
23 Visitor’s Authority that requires the employment of certain workers even if the
24 project does not qualify as a public work. (Section 33 of chapter 375, Statutes of
25 Nevada 2019, at page 2364) Section 5 of this bill provides that workers who
26 perform custom fabrication on such a project must also be paid prevailing wages.
27 Section 6 of this bill provides that the requirement to pay prevailing wage to
28 workers who perform custom fabrication does not apply to a public works contract
29 or performance contract awarded before January 1, 2026.

SUMMARY—Revises provisions governing public works projects.
(BDR 28-816)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.

(NOT REQUESTED BY AFFECTED LOCAL GOVERNMENT)
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to governmental administration; requiring the
payment of prevailing wages to workers who perform
custom fabrication on a public work or for certain
performance contracts of local governments or state
agencies; requiring the payment of prevailing wages to
workers who perform custom fabrication on any project
financed or otherwise undertaken by the Tahoe-Douglas
Visitor’s Authority; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, every contract to which a public body of this State is a
2 party, requiring the employment of skilled mechanics, skilled workers, semiskilled
3 mechanics, semiskilled workers or unskilled labor in the performance of a public
4 work, must contain in express terms the hourly and daily rate of wages to be paid to
5 each of the classes of mechanics and workers. The hourly and daily rate of wages
6 must not be less than the prevailing wage in the region in which the public work is
7 located, as determined by the Labor Commissioner. (NRS 338.020) Section 2 of
8 this bill provides that workers who perform custom fabrication on a public work
9 must also be paid such a prevailing wage. Section 1 of this bill: (1) defines the term
10 “custom fabrication”; (2) defines the term “nonstandard good or material”; and (3)
11 revises the definition of “worker” to include a worker who performs custom
12 fabrication.
13 Under existing law, performance contracts for certain operating cost-savings
14 measures entered into by local governments and state agencies must contain in
15 express terms the hourly and daily rate of wages to be paid to each class of
16 mechanics and workers. Such wages must not be less than the prevailing wage in
-
*AB213*

– 2 –
17 the region in which the local government or state agency is located. (NRS 332.390,
18 333A.120) Similar to section 1, sections 3 and 4 of this bill, respectively, provide
19 that workers who perform custom fabrication must also be paid such a prevailing
20 wage.
21 The Tahoe-Douglas Visitor’s Authority Act requires the payment of prevailing
22 wages on any project financed or otherwise undertaken by the Tahoe-Douglas
23 Visitor’s Authority that requires the employment of certain workers even if the
24 project does not qualify as a public work. (Section 33 of chapter 375, Statutes of
25 Nevada 2019, at page 2364) Section 5 of this bill provides that workers who
26 perform custom fabrication on such a project must also be paid prevailing wages.
27 Section 6 of this bill provides that the requirement to pay prevailing wage to
28 workers who perform custom fabrication does not apply to a public works contract
29 or performance contract awarded before January 1, 2026.
