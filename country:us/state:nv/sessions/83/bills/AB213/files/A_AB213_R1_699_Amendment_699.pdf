EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to governmental administration; requiring certain persons who
qualify for certain preferences in bidding on a public work to certify,
under certain conditions, that the persons will ensure that any
nonstandard good or material procured for the public work is custom
fabricated in this State; requiring the payment of prevailing wages to
workers who perform custom fabrication on a public work or for
certain performance contracts of local governments or state agencies;
requiring the payment of prevailing wages to workers who perform
custom fabrication on any project financed or otherwise undertaken by
the Tahoe-Douglas Visitor’s Authority; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, every contract to which a public body of this State is a party,
2 requiring the employment of skilled mechanics, skilled workers, semiskilled mechanics,
3 semiskilled workers or unskilled labor in the performance of a public work, must contain in
4 express terms the hourly and daily rate of wages to be paid to each of the classes of mechanics
5 and workers. The hourly and daily rate of wages must not be less than the prevailing wage in
6 the region in which the public work is located, as determined by the Labor Commissioner.
7 (NRS 338.020) Section 2 of this bill provides that workers who perform custom fabrication
8 on a public work must also be paid such a prevailing wage. Section 2.2 of this bill provides
9 that workers who perform custom fabrication for a public work are deemed to be
10 employed on the public work regardless of the location at which the custom fabrication
11 is performed.
12 Section 1 of this bill: (1) defines the term “custom fabrication”; (2) defines the term
13 “nonstandard good or material”; and (3) revises the definition of “worker” to include a worker
14 who performs custom fabrication.
15 Under existing law, performance contracts for certain operating cost-savings measures
16 entered into by local governments and state agencies must contain in express terms the hourly
17 and daily rate of wages to be paid to each class of mechanics and workers. Such wages must
18 not be less than the prevailing wage in the region in which the local government or state
19 agency is located. (NRS 332.390, 333A.120) Similar to section 1, sections 3 and 4 of this

Senate Amendment No. 699 to Assembly Bill No. 213 First Reprint Page 4
20 bill, respectively, provide that workers who perform custom fabrication must also be paid
21 such a prevailing wage.
22 The Tahoe-Douglas Visitor’s Authority Act requires the payment of prevailing wages on
23 any project financed or otherwise undertaken by the Tahoe-Douglas Visitor’s Authority that
24 requires the employment of certain workers even if the project does not qualify as a public
25 work. (Section 33 of chapter 375, Statutes of Nevada 2019, at page 2364) Section 5 of this bill
26 provides that workers who perform custom fabrication on such a project must also be paid
27 prevailing wages.
28 Section 6 of this bill provides that the requirement to pay prevailing wage to workers who
29 perform custom fabrication does not apply to a public works contract or performance contract
30 awarded before January 1, 2026.
31 Existing law provides that as a condition of receiving certain preferences in bidding on a
32 public work, a contractor, an applicant or a design-build team is required to submit to the
33 public body sponsoring or financing the public work, a signed affidavit which makes certain
34 certifications. (NRS 338.0117) Section 1.5 of this bill requires an additional certification that
35 if the public work requires the procurement of any nonstandard good or material and is
36 located in a county whose population is 100,000 or more (currently Clark and Washoe
37 Counties), the contractor, applicant or design-build team and any subcontractor engaged on
38 the public work will: (1) ensure that each nonstandard good or material is custom fabricated in
39 this State; and (2) maintain and make available for inspection certain records concerning each
40 nonstandard good or material procured for the public work. Sections 2.3 and 2.7 of this bill
41 make conforming changes to refer to provisions that have been renumbered in section 1.5.
