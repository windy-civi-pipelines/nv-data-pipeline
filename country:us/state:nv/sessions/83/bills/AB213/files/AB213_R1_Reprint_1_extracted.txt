~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to governmental administration; requiring certain
persons who qualify for certain preferences in bidding on
a public work to certify, under certain conditions, that the
persons will ensure that any nonstandard good or material
procured for the public work is custom fabricated in this
State; requiring the payment of prevailing wages to
workers who perform custom fabrication on a public work
or for certain performance contracts of local governments
or state agencies; requiring the payment of prevailing
wages to workers who perform custom fabrication on any
project financed or otherwise undertaken by the Tahoe-
Douglas Visitor’s Authority; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, every contract to which a public body of this State is a
2 party, requiring the employment of skilled mechanics, skilled workers, semiskilled
3 mechanics, semiskilled workers or unskilled labor in the performance of a public
4 work, must contain in express terms the hourly and daily rate of wages to be paid to
5 each of the classes of mechanics and workers. The hourly and daily rate of wages
6 must not be less than the prevailing wage in the region in which the public work is
7 located, as determined by the Labor Commissioner. (NRS 338.020) Section 2 of
8 this bill provides that workers who perform custom fabrication on a public work
9 must also be paid such a prevailing wage. Section 1 of this bill: (1) defines the term
10 “custom fabrication”; (2) defines the term “nonstandard good or material”; and
-
*AB213_R1*
– 2 –
11 (3) revises the definition of “worker” to include a worker who performs custom
12 fabrication.
13 Under existing law, performance contracts for certain operating cost-savings
14 measures entered into by local governments and state agencies must contain in
15 express terms the hourly and daily rate of wages to be paid to each class of
16 mechanics and workers. Such wages must not be less than the prevailing wage in
17 the region in which the local government or state agency is located. (NRS 332.390,
18 333A.120) Similar to section 1, sections 3 and 4 of this bill, respectively, provide
19 that workers who perform custom fabrication must also be paid such a prevailing
20 wage.
21 The Tahoe-Douglas Visitor’s Authority Act requires the payment of prevailing
22 wages on any project financed or otherwise undertaken by the Tahoe-Douglas
23 Visitor’s Authority that requires the employment of certain workers even if the
24 project does not qualify as a public work. (Section 33 of chapter 375, Statutes of
25 Nevada 2019, at page 2364) Section 5 of this bill provides that workers who
26 perform custom fabrication on such a project must also be paid prevailing wages.
27 Section 6 of this bill provides that the requirement to pay prevailing wage to
28 workers who perform custom fabrication does not apply to a public works contract
29 or performance contract awarded before January 1, 2026.
30 Existing law provides that as a condition of receiving certain preferences in
31 bidding on a public work, a contractor, an applicant or a design-build team is
32 required to submit to the public body sponsoring or financing the public work, a
33 signed affidavit which makes certain certifications. (NRS 338.0117) Section 1.5 of
34 this bill requires an additional certification that if the public work requires the
35 procurement of any nonstandard good or material and is located in a county whose
36 population is 100,000 or more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties), the
37 contractor, applicant or design-build team and any subcontractor engaged on the
38 public work will: (1) ensure that each nonstandard good or material is custom
39 fabricated in this State; and (2) maintain and make available for inspection certain
40 records concerning each nonstandard good or material procured for the public
41 work. Sections 2.3 and 2.7 of this bill make conforming changes to refer to
42 provisions that have been renumbered in section 1.5.

(Reprinted with amendments adopted on April 17, 2025)
FIRST REPRINT A.B. 213
ASSEMBLY BILL NO. 213–ASSEMBLYMEMBER MONROE-MORENO
PREFILED FEBRUARY 3, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Government Affairs
SUMMARY—Revises provisions governing public works projects.
(BDR 28-816)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
CONTAINS UNFUNDED MANDATE (§§ 2, 3-5)
(NOT REQUESTED BY AFFECTED LOCAL GOVERNMENT)
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to governmental administration; requiring certain
persons who qualify for certain preferences in bidding on
a public work to certify, under certain conditions, that the
persons will ensure that any nonstandard good or material
procured for the public work is custom fabricated in this
State; requiring the payment of prevailing wages to
workers who perform custom fabrication on a public work
or for certain performance contracts of local governments
or state agencies; requiring the payment of prevailing
wages to workers who perform custom fabrication on any
project financed or otherwise undertaken by the Tahoe-
Douglas Visitor’s Authority; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, every contract to which a public body of this State is a
2 party, requiring the employment of skilled mechanics, skilled workers, semiskilled
3 mechanics, semiskilled workers or unskilled labor in the performance of a public
4 work, must contain in express terms the hourly and daily rate of wages to be paid to
5 each of the classes of mechanics and workers. The hourly and daily rate of wages
6 must not be less than the prevailing wage in the region in which the public work is
7 located, as determined by the Labor Commissioner. (NRS 338.020) Section 2 of
8 this bill provides that workers who perform custom fabrication on a public work
9 must also be paid such a prevailing wage. Section 1 of this bill: (1) defines the term
10 “custom fabrication”; (2) defines the term “nonstandard good or material”; and
-
*AB213_R1*

– 2 –
11 (3) revises the definition of “worker” to include a worker who performs custom
12 fabrication.
13 Under existing law, performance contracts for certain operating cost-savings
14 measures entered into by local governments and state agencies must contain in
15 express terms the hourly and daily rate of wages to be paid to each class of
16 mechanics and workers. Such wages must not be less than the prevailing wage in
17 the region in which the local government or state agency is located. (NRS 332.390,
18 333A.120) Similar to section 1, sections 3 and 4 of this bill, respectively, provide
19 that workers who perform custom fabrication must also be paid such a prevailing
20 wage.
21 The Tahoe-Douglas Visitor’s Authority Act requires the payment of prevailing
22 wages on any project financed or otherwise undertaken by the Tahoe-Douglas
23 Visitor’s Authority that requires the employment of certain workers even if the
24 project does not qualify as a public work. (Section 33 of chapter 375, Statutes of
25 Nevada 2019, at page 2364) Section 5 of this bill provides that workers who
26 perform custom fabrication on such a project must also be paid prevailing wages.
27 Section 6 of this bill provides that the requirement to pay prevailing wage to
28 workers who perform custom fabrication does not apply to a public works contract
29 or performance contract awarded before January 1, 2026.
30 Existing law provides that as a condition of receiving certain preferences in
31 bidding on a public work, a contractor, an applicant or a design-build team is
32 required to submit to the public body sponsoring or financing the public work, a
33 signed affidavit which makes certain certifications. (NRS 338.0117) Section 1.5 of
34 this bill requires an additional certification that if the public work requires the
35 procurement of any nonstandard good or material and is located in a county whose
36 population is 100,000 or more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties), the
37 contractor, applicant or design-build team and any subcontractor engaged on the
38 public work will: (1) ensure that each nonstandard good or material is custom
39 fabricated in this State; and (2) maintain and make available for inspection certain
40 records concerning each nonstandard good or material procured for the public
41 work. Sections 2.3 and 2.7 of this bill make conforming changes to refer to
42 provisions that have been renumbered in section 1.5.

21 in bidding. Upon issuance, the certificate of eligibility to receive a
22 preference in bidding on public works becomes part of the
23 contractor’s license for which the contractor submitted the
24 application.
25 9. If a contractor who applies to the State Contractors’ Board
26 for a certificate of eligibility to receive a preference in bidding on
27 public works:
28 (a) Submits false information to the Board regarding the
29 required payment of taxes, the contractor is not eligible to receive a
30 preference in bidding on public works for a period of 5 years after
31 the date on which the Board becomes aware of the submission of the
32 false information; or
33 (b) Is found by the Board to have, within the preceding 5 years,
34 materially breached a contract for a public work for which the cost
35 exceeds $5,000,000, the contractor is not eligible to receive a
36 preference in bidding on public works.
37 10. If any federal statute or regulation precludes the granting of
38 federal assistance or reduces the amount of that assistance for a
39 particular public work because of the provisions of subsection 2,
40 those provisions do not apply insofar as their application would
41 preclude or reduce federal assistance for that work.
42 11. If a bid is submitted by two or more contractors as a joint
43 venture or by one of them as a joint venturer, the bid may receive a
44 preference in bidding only if both or all of the joint venturers
45 separately meet the requirements of subsection 2.

1 12. The State Contractors’ Board shall adopt regulations and
2 may assess reasonable fees relating to the certification of contractors
3 for a preference in bidding on public works.
4 13. A person who submitted a bid on the public work or an
5 entity who believes that the contractor who was awarded the

8 challenge the validity of the certificate by filing a written objection
9 with the local government to which the contractor has submitted a
10 bid on a contract for the construction of a public work. A written
11 objection authorized pursuant to this subsection must:
12 (a) Set forth proof or substantiating evidence to support the
13 belief of the person or entity that the contractor wrongfully holds a
14 certificate of eligibility to receive a preference in bidding on public
15 works; and
16 (b) Be filed with the local government not later than 3 business
17 days after the opening of the bids by the local government or its
18 authorized representative.
19 14. If a local government receives a written objection pursuant
20 to subsection 13, the local government shall determine whether the
21 objection is accompanied by the proof or substantiating evidence
22 required pursuant to paragraph (a) of that subsection. If the local
23 government determines that the objection is not accompanied by the
24 required proof or substantiating evidence, the local government shall
25 dismiss the objection and the local government or its authorized
26 representative may proceed immediately to award the contract. If
27 the local government determines that the objection is accompanied
28 by the required proof or substantiating evidence, the local
29 government shall determine whether the contractor qualifies for the
30 certificate pursuant to the provisions of this section and the local
31 government or its authorized representative may proceed to award
32 the contract accordingly.
