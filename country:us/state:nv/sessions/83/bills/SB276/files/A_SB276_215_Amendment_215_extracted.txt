AN ACT relating to water; establishing provisions governing the reporting and
sharing of certain information relating to water by certain
governmental entities and Indian tribes; providing a penalty; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth various requirements to control water pollution in this State,
2 including providing for the issuance of a general permit or an individual permit for discharges
3 into the waters of the State. (NRS 445A.475, 445A.480) Existing law requires: (1) the State
4 Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, with certain exceptions, to notify each
5 interested person, appropriate governmental agency and affected Indian tribe of each complete
6 application for such a permit and provide them with an opportunity to submit written views
7 and recommendations on the permit; and (2) the State Environmental Commission, with
8 certain exceptions, to provide by regulation an opportunity for each permit applicant,
9 interested agency, city, county, Indian tribe or irrigation district located downstream from the
10 point of discharge, or any person, to request a public hearing with respect to a permit
11 application. (NRS 445A.590, 445A.595) [Section 2 of this bill requires each city, county,
12 unincorporated town, district or water authority in this State and authorizes each Indian tribe
13 in this State that collects data on the water quality of the State or discharges into the waters of
14 the State to report such data to the Division of Environmental Protection of the Department.]
15 Section 3 of this bill requires any city, county, unincorporated town, general
16 improvement district , wastewater district or water authority of this State: (1) in the event of
17 an incident resulting in the discharge of sewage [,] or industrial waste or any other
18 unauthorized discharge into the waters of the State, under certain circumstances, to notify
19 [every other state agency, city, county, unincorporated town, district, water authority and
20 Indian tribe in the area of the incident that may be affected;] the Division of Environmental
Senate Amendment No. 215 to Senate Bill No. 276 Page 4
21 Protection of the Department; and (2) upon request, provide information to an Indian tribe
22 that requests [such] information that is a public record relating to an incident or [substantial
23 change in the] a policy of water treatment . [or use of water.] Section 3 additionally : (1)
24 requires the Division, if notified of a discharge, to then notify any Indian tribe that may
25 be affected by the discharge; and (2) prohibits a city, county, unincorporated town, general
26 improvement district , wastewater district or water authority from entering into a contract,
27 agreement or other legal mechanism that would prevent the sharing of such information with
28 an Indian tribe.
29 [Section 4 of this bill requires the Division to: (1) develop a form for reporting data and
30 information in accordance with sections 2 and 3; and (2) ensure any such data and information
31 that is reported is available to all other cities, counties, unincorporated towns, districts, water
32 authorities and Indian tribes in this State.
33 Section 6 of this bill requires: (1) each city, county, unincorporated town, district or water
34 authority that submits an application to discharge from a point source into the waters of the
35 State which may degrade the water quality of any other city, county, unincorporated town,
36 district, water authority or Indian tribe to notify that governmental entity; and (2) the
37 Department to ensure each such entity is notified if an Indian tribe submits such an
38 application.
39 Existing law requires each holder of certain discharge or injection permits to report the
40 infiltration of contaminants to underground waters of this State to the Department. (NRS
41 445A.505) Section 7 of this bill also requires the holder of such a permit to notify any city,
42 county, unincorporated town, district, water authority or Indian tribe that may be affected by
43 the contamination.]
44 Section 5 of this bill applies certain definitions in existing law relating to water pollution
45 to the provisions of [sections 2-4.] section 3. Sections 8-15 of this bill apply certain
46 provisions relating to the enforcement and civil and criminal penalties to the provisions of
47 [sections 2-4.] section 3.

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to water; establishing provisions governing the reporting and
sharing of certain information relating to water by certain
governmental entities and Indian tribes; providing a penalty; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth various requirements to control water pollution in this State,
2 including providing for the issuance of a general permit or an individual permit for discharges
3 into the waters of the State. (NRS 445A.475, 445A.480) Existing law requires: (1) the State
4 Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, with certain exceptions, to notify each
5 interested person, appropriate governmental agency and affected Indian tribe of each complete
6 application for such a permit and provide them with an opportunity to submit written views
7 and recommendations on the permit; and (2) the State Environmental Commission, with
8 certain exceptions, to provide by regulation an opportunity for each permit applicant,
9 interested agency, city, county, Indian tribe or irrigation district located downstream from the
10 point of discharge, or any person, to request a public hearing with respect to a permit
11 application. (NRS 445A.590, 445A.595) [Section 2 of this bill requires each city, county,
12 unincorporated town, district or water authority in this State and authorizes each Indian tribe
13 in this State that collects data on the water quality of the State or discharges into the waters of
14 the State to report such data to the Division of Environmental Protection of the Department.]
15 Section 3 of this bill requires any city, county, unincorporated town, general
16 improvement district , wastewater district or water authority of this State: (1) in the event of
17 an incident resulting in the discharge of sewage [,] or industrial waste or any other
18 unauthorized discharge into the waters of the State, under certain circumstances, to notify
19 [every other state agency, city, county, unincorporated town, district, water authority and
20 Indian tribe in the area of the incident that may be affected;] the Division of Environmental

Senate Amendment No. 215 to Senate Bill No. 276 Page 4
21 Protection of the Department; and (2) upon request, provide information to an Indian tribe
22 that requests [such] information that is a public record relating to an incident or [substantial
23 change in the] a policy of water treatment . [or use of water.] Section 3 additionally : (1)
24 requires the Division, if notified of a discharge, to then notify any Indian tribe that may
25 be affected by the discharge; and (2) prohibits a city, county, unincorporated town, general
26 improvement district , wastewater district or water authority from entering into a contract,
27 agreement or other legal mechanism that would prevent the sharing of such information with
28 an Indian tribe.
29 [Section 4 of this bill requires the Division to: (1) develop a form for reporting data and
30 information in accordance with sections 2 and 3; and (2) ensure any such data and information
31 that is reported is available to all other cities, counties, unincorporated towns, districts, water
32 authorities and Indian tribes in this State.
33 Section 6 of this bill requires: (1) each city, county, unincorporated town, district or water
34 authority that submits an application to discharge from a point source into the waters of the
35 State which may degrade the water quality of any other city, county, unincorporated town,
36 district, water authority or Indian tribe to notify that governmental entity; and (2) the
37 Department to ensure each such entity is notified if an Indian tribe submits such an
38 application.
39 Existing law requires each holder of certain discharge or injection permits to report the
40 infiltration of contaminants to underground waters of this State to the Department. (NRS
41 445A.505) Section 7 of this bill also requires the holder of such a permit to notify any city,
42 county, unincorporated town, district, water authority or Indian tribe that may be affected by
43 the contamination.]
44 Section 5 of this bill applies certain definitions in existing law relating to water pollution
45 to the provisions of [sections 2-4.] section 3. Sections 8-15 of this bill apply certain
46 provisions relating to the enforcement and civil and criminal penalties to the provisions of
47 [sections 2-4.] section 3.

19 unincorporated town, general improvement district , wastewater district or water
20 authority from sharing information in accordance with the requirements of this
21 section.
22 [4. As used in this section, “substantial change” means an individual
