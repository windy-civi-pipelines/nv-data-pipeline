2 State, including providing for the issuance of a general permit or an individual
3 permit for discharges into the waters of the State. (NRS 445A.475, 445A.480)
4 Existing law requires: (1) the State Department of Conservation and Natural

6 governmental agency and affected Indian tribe of each complete application for
7 such a permit and provide them with an opportunity to submit written views and
8 recommendations on the permit; and (2) the State Environmental Commission, with
9 certain exceptions, to provide by regulation an opportunity for each permit
10 applicant, interested agency, city, county, Indian tribe or irrigation district located
11 downstream from the point of discharge, or any person, to request a public hearing
12 with respect to a permit application. (NRS 445A.590, 445A.595)
13 Section 3 of this bill requires any city, county, unincorporated town, general
14 improvement district, wastewater district or water authority of this State: (1) in the
15 event of an incident resulting in the discharge of sewage or industrial waste or any
16 other unauthorized discharge into the waters of the State, under certain
17 circumstances, to notify the Division of Environmental Protection of the

-

19 requests information that is a public record relating to an incident or a policy of
20 water treatment. Section 3 additionally: (1) requires the Division, if notified of a
21 discharge, to then notify any Indian tribe that may be affected by the discharge; and
22 (2) prohibits a city, county, unincorporated town, general improvement district,
23 wastewater district or water authority from entering into a contract, agreement or
24 other legal mechanism that would prevent the sharing of such information with an
25 Indian tribe.
26 Section 5 of this bill applies certain definitions in existing law relating to water
27 pollution to the provisions of section 3. Sections 8-15 of this bill apply certain
28 provisions relating to the enforcement and civil and criminal penalties to the
