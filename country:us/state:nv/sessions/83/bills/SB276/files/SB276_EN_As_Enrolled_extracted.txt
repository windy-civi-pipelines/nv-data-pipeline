CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to water; establishing provisions governing the
reporting and sharing of certain information relating to water
by certain governmental entities and Indian tribes; providing
a penalty; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law sets forth various requirements to control water pollution in this
State, including providing for the issuance of a general permit or an individual
permit for discharges into the waters of the State. (NRS 445A.475, 445A.480)
Existing law requires: (1) the State Department of Conservation and Natural
Resources, with certain exceptions, to notify each interested person, appropriate
governmental agency and affected Indian tribe of each complete application for
such a permit and provide them with an opportunity to submit written views and
recommendations on the permit; and (2) the State Environmental Commission, with
certain exceptions, to provide by regulation an opportunity for each permit
applicant, interested agency, city, county, Indian tribe or irrigation district located
downstream from the point of discharge, or any person, to request a public hearing
with respect to a permit application. (NRS 445A.590, 445A.595)

Section 2:
Section 3 of this bill requires any city, county, unincorporated town, general

circumstances, to notify the Division of Environmental Protection of the
Department; and (2) upon request, provide information to an Indian tribe that
requests information that is a public record relating to an incident or a policy of
water treatment. Section 3 additionally: (1) requires the Division, if notified of a
discharge, to then notify any Indian tribe that may be affected by the discharge; and
(2) prohibits a city, county, unincorporated town, general improvement district,
wastewater district or water authority from entering into a contract, agreement or
other legal mechanism that would prevent the sharing of such information with an
Indian tribe.

Section 3:
Section 5 of this bill applies certain definitions in existing law relating to water
pollution to the provisions of section 3. Sections 8-15 of this bill apply certain
provisions relating to the enforcement and civil and criminal penalties to the
