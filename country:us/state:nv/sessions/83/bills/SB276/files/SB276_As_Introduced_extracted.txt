EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to water; establishing provisions governing the
reporting and sharing of certain information relating to
water by certain governmental entities and Indian tribes;
providing a penalty; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth various requirements to control water pollution in this
2 State, including providing for the issuance of a general permit or an individual
3 permit for discharges into the waters of the State. (NRS 445A.475) Existing law
4 requires: (1) the State Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, with
5 certain exceptions, to notify each interested person, appropriate governmental
6 agency and affected Indian tribe of each complete application for such a permit and
7 provide them with an opportunity to submit written views and recommendations on
8 the permit; and (2) the State Environmental Commission, with certain exceptions,
9 to provide by regulation an opportunity for each permit applicant, interested
10 agency, city, county, Indian tribe or irrigation district located downstream from the
11 point of discharge, or any person to request a public hearing with respect to a
12 permit application. (NRS 445A.590, 445A.595) Section 2 of this bill requires each
13 city, county, unincorporated town, district or water authority in this State and
14 authorizes each Indian tribe in this State that collects data on the water quality of
-
*SB276*
– 2 –
15 the State or discharges into the waters of the State to report such data to the
16 Division of Environmental Protection of the Department.
17 Section 3 of this bill requires any city, county, unincorporated town, district or
18 water authority of this State: (1) in the event of an incident resulting in sewage,
19 industrial waste or any other unauthorized discharge into the waters of the State,
20 under certain circumstances, to notify every other state agency, city, county,
21 unincorporated town, district, water authority and Indian tribe in the area of the
22 incident that may be affected; and (2) upon request, provide information to an
23 Indian tribe that requests such information relating to an incident or substantial
24 change in the policy of water treatment or use of water. Section 3 additionally
25 prohibits a city, county, unincorporated town, district or water authority from
26 entering into a contract, agreement or other legal mechanism that would prevent the
27 sharing of such information with an Indian tribe.
28 Section 4 of this bill requires the Division to: (1) develop a form for reporting
29 data and information in accordance with sections 2 and 3; and (2) ensure any such
30 data and information that is reported is available to all other cities, counties,
31 unincorporated towns, districts, water authorities and Indian tribes in this State.
32 Section 6 of this bill requires: (1) each city, county, unincorporated town,
33 district or water authority that submits an application to discharge from a point
34 source into the waters of the State which may degrade the water quality of any
35 other city, county, unincorporated town, district, water authority or Indian tribe to
36 notify that governmental entity; and (2) the Department to ensure each such entity
37 is notified if an Indian tribe submits such an application.
38 Existing law requires each holder of certain discharge or injection permits to
39 report the infiltration of contaminants to underground waters of this State to the
40 Department. (NRS 445A.505) Section 7 of this bill also requires the holder of such
41 a permit to notify any city, county, unincorporated town, district, water authority or
42 Indian tribe that may be affected by the contamination.
43 Section 5 of this bill applies certain definitions in existing law relating to water
44 pollution to the provisions of sections 2-4. Sections 8-15 of this bill apply certain
45 provisions relating to the enforcement and civil and criminal penalties to the
46 provisions of sections 2-4.

SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to water. (BDR 40-750)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
CONTAINS UNFUNDED MANDATE (§ 2)
(NOT REQUESTED BY AFFECTED LOCAL GOVERNMENT)
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to water; establishing provisions governing the
reporting and sharing of certain information relating to
water by certain governmental entities and Indian tribes;
providing a penalty; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth various requirements to control water pollution in this
2 State, including providing for the issuance of a general permit or an individual
3 permit for discharges into the waters of the State. (NRS 445A.475) Existing law
4 requires: (1) the State Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, with
5 certain exceptions, to notify each interested person, appropriate governmental
6 agency and affected Indian tribe of each complete application for such a permit and
7 provide them with an opportunity to submit written views and recommendations on
8 the permit; and (2) the State Environmental Commission, with certain exceptions,
9 to provide by regulation an opportunity for each permit applicant, interested
10 agency, city, county, Indian tribe or irrigation district located downstream from the
11 point of discharge, or any person to request a public hearing with respect to a
12 permit application. (NRS 445A.590, 445A.595) Section 2 of this bill requires each
13 city, county, unincorporated town, district or water authority in this State and
14 authorizes each Indian tribe in this State that collects data on the water quality of
-
*SB276*

– 2 –
15 the State or discharges into the waters of the State to report such data to the
16 Division of Environmental Protection of the Department.
17 Section 3 of this bill requires any city, county, unincorporated town, district or
18 water authority of this State: (1) in the event of an incident resulting in sewage,
19 industrial waste or any other unauthorized discharge into the waters of the State,
20 under certain circumstances, to notify every other state agency, city, county,
21 unincorporated town, district, water authority and Indian tribe in the area of the
22 incident that may be affected; and (2) upon request, provide information to an
23 Indian tribe that requests such information relating to an incident or substantial
24 change in the policy of water treatment or use of water. Section 3 additionally
25 prohibits a city, county, unincorporated town, district or water authority from
26 entering into a contract, agreement or other legal mechanism that would prevent the
27 sharing of such information with an Indian tribe.
28 Section 4 of this bill requires the Division to: (1) develop a form for reporting
29 data and information in accordance with sections 2 and 3; and (2) ensure any such
30 data and information that is reported is available to all other cities, counties,
31 unincorporated towns, districts, water authorities and Indian tribes in this State.
32 Section 6 of this bill requires: (1) each city, county, unincorporated town,
33 district or water authority that submits an application to discharge from a point
34 source into the waters of the State which may degrade the water quality of any
35 other city, county, unincorporated town, district, water authority or Indian tribe to
36 notify that governmental entity; and (2) the Department to ensure each such entity
37 is notified if an Indian tribe submits such an application.
38 Existing law requires each holder of certain discharge or injection permits to
39 report the infiltration of contaminants to underground waters of this State to the
40 Department. (NRS 445A.505) Section 7 of this bill also requires the holder of such
41 a permit to notify any city, county, unincorporated town, district, water authority or
42 Indian tribe that may be affected by the contamination.
43 Section 5 of this bill applies certain definitions in existing law relating to water
44 pollution to the provisions of sections 2-4. Sections 8-15 of this bill apply certain
45 provisions relating to the enforcement and civil and criminal penalties to the
46 provisions of sections 2-4.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

*SB276*

– 3 –
1 are not authorized or that exceed those authorized by a permit
2 issued by the Department pursuant to the provisions of NRS
3 445A.300 to 445A.730, inclusive, and sections 2, 3 and 4 of this

10 has powers, duties or jurisdiction within the area of the incident
11 that has been notified of the incident shall notify every other state
12 agency, city, county, unincorporated town, district, water authority
13 and Indian tribe in the area of the incident that may be affected.

18 applicable entity shall provide the requested information to the

24 information in accordance with the requirements of this section.
25 4. As used in this section, “substantial change” means an
26 individual change that will result in a significant impact, or minor
27 changes that cumulatively will result in a significant impact, to
28 water quality.
29 Sec. 4. The Division shall:
30 1. Develop a fillable form in portable document format for a

33 required or authorized pursuant to sections 2 and 3 of this act;
34 and
35 2. Ensure any data and information that is reported pursuant
36 to this section is available to all other cities, counties,
