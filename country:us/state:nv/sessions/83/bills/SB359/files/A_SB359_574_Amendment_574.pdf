~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to vehicles; revising provisions governing a hearing to contest the
determination set forth in a civil infraction citation; [requiring]
authorizing a court to consolidate a criminal complaint for a
misdemeanor offense and a civil infraction [to be included in the same
criminal complaint] under certain circumstances; prescribing
requirements for a consolidated hearing; clarifying that certain
traffic and related offenses may be charged as misdemeanors if
committed in conjunction with driving under the influence of
alcohol or a controlled substance; requiring those offenses to be
reduced to civil infractions if the charge of driving under the
influence is dismissed unless an exception applies; revising
provisions governing the reduction of certain moving traffic
violations to nonmoving violations; authorizing a board of county
commissioners to impose a civil penalty in lieu of a criminal
penalty for the violation of a county ordinance under certain
circumstances; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes the procedures for a hearing at which a person may contest
2 whether the person committed a violation set forth in a civil infraction citation. (NRS
3 484A.7041) Section 1 of this bill makes certain rules of evidence applicable to the
4 adjudication of contested cases under the Nevada Administrative Procedure Act
5 applicable to any such hearing. Section 4 of this bill replaces a requirement that, before any
6 such hearing, the person must post a bond equal to the amount of the full payment of the
7 monetary penalty, administrative assessment and any fees specified in the civil infraction
8 citation with a requirement that the person must post a bond of not more than that amount.
9 Section 4 also: (1) authorizes counsel to appear on behalf of a person who requests a hearing;
10 and (2) provides that if counsel appears , [at the hearing,] the person [who requested the
11 hearing] is not required to attend [. Section 1 of this bill makes certain rules of evidence
12 applicable to] the [adjudication of contested cases under the Nevada Administrative Procedure
13 Act applicable to any such] hearing [.] and is deemed to have stipulated to his or her
14 identity as the recipient of the civil infraction citation. Finally, section 4 requires a court
15 to dismiss a civil infraction citation if the peace officer who issued the citation does not

Assembly Amendment No. 574 to Senate Bill No. 359 Page 4
16 appear at the hearing or submit a written statement, unless sufficient evidence is
17 otherwise presented to establish the infraction.
18 Under existing law, if a person is arrested for a misdemeanor offense arising out of the
19 same facts and circumstances as certain violations of law that are punishable as civil
20 infractions, the offense and the civil infraction may be included in the same criminal
21 complaint. (NRS 484A.7033) Section 2 of this bill [revises this provision to] instead [require
22 the inclusion of both the] authorizes a court, under certain circumstances, to consolidate a
23 criminal complaint for a misdemeanor offense and [the] a civil infraction . [in the same
24 criminal complaint.] Section 2 also prescribes procedures for holding a single,
25 consolidated hearing and sets forth specific requirements for such a hearing.
26 Existing law requires that civil penalties imposed for civil infractions be paid to: (1)
27 the treasurer of the city in which the civil infraction occurred; or (2) if the civil
28 infraction did not occur in a city, the treasurer of the county in which the civil infraction
29 occurred. (NRS 484A.7043) Section 4.5 of this bill instead requires that civil penalties
30 collected by a: (1) municipal court be paid to the treasurer of the city in which the court
31 is located; and (2) justice court be paid to the treasurer of the county in which the court
32 is located. Section 4.5 also prohibits a court from awarding attorney’s fees or costs to
33 any party in a hearing to contest a civil infraction citation, regardless of the outcome.
34 Existing law: (1) authorizes a prosecuting attorney to elect to treat certain traffic and
35 related offenses that are punishable as a misdemeanor instead as a civil infraction; and (2)
36 provides a procedure for making such an election. Pursuant to this procedure, existing law
37 requires the prosecuting attorney to make the election on or before the time scheduled for the
38 first appearance of the defendant. (NRS 484A.7049) Section 5 of this bill eliminates this
39 requirement and certain related procedural requirements. Section 3 of this bill makes a
40 conforming change to remove a reference to provisions eliminated by section 5.
41 Under existing law, if a person commits a traffic or related offense punishable as a
42 civil infraction while under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance, the person
43 may instead be charged with a misdemeanor for the traffic or related offense. (NRS
44 484A.705) Section 6 of this bill clarifies that this provision applies when a person
45 commits a traffic or related offense and is also charged with driving under the influence
46 of alcohol or a controlled substance. Section 6 further requires the misdemeanor charge
47 to be reduced to a civil infraction if the charge of driving under the influence of alcohol
48 or a controlled substance, is dismissed, unless the dismissal occurs pursuant to a plea
49 agreement.
50 Existing law makes it unlawful to drive a vehicle at certain speeds. Existing law also:
51 (1) authorizes a court, in its discretion, to reduce a violation of this prohibition to a
52 nonmoving violation; and (2) establishes a presumption in favor of such a reduction if
53 the person cited for the violation pays all applicable fines and fees before the date on
54 which the person is first required to appear in court relating to the citation. (NRS
55 484B.600) Section 7 of this bill eliminates this presumption. Section 7 instead authorizes
56 a court, in its discretion, to reduce a moving traffic violation for speeding to a
57 nonmoving violation if the person cited: (1) admits to committing the violation and pays
58 all applicable fines and fees on or before the date on which the person is first required to
59 appear in court relating to the citation; and (2) provides the court with a copy of his or
60 her driving record. Section 7 further prohibits a court from granting such a reduction if
61 the driving record of the person indicates a pattern of moving traffic violations.
62 Existing law also authorizes a board of county commissioners to provide a civil
63 penalty in lieu of a criminal penalty for the violation of certain types of ordinances. (NRS
64 244.189, 244.3575, 244.359) Section 8 of this bill authorizes a board of county
65 commissioners to impose a civil penalty instead of a criminal penalty for the violation of
66 a county ordinance unless state law expressly prohibits the imposition of a civil penalty
67 or prescribes a criminal penalty for the same act or omission.

49 order of the court during the pendency of the appeal must equal the amount of the

18 administrative assessments set forth in NRS 176.059, 176.0611, 176.0613 and
19 176.0623 in the amount that the person would be required to pay if the civil penalty
20 were a fine imposed on a defendant who pleads guilty or guilty but mentally ill or is
21 found guilty or guilty but mentally ill of a misdemeanor. If, in lieu of a civil
22 penalty, the court authorizes a person to successfully complete a course of traffic
23 safety approved by the Department of Motor Vehicles, the court must order the
24 person to pay the amount of the administrative assessment that corresponds to the
25 civil penalty for which the defendant would have otherwise been responsible. The

43 determines that any circumstances warrant such a waiver or reduction.
44 (c) Reduce any moving violation for which a person was issued a civil
45 infraction citation to a nonmoving violation if the court determines that any
46 circumstances warrant such a reduction.
47 5. A court shall not award attorney’s fees or costs to any party in a hearing
48 conducted pursuant to NRS 484A.7041, regardless of the outcome.

29 same act or omission.
