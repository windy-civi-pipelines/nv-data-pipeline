Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law establishes the procedures for a hearing at which a person may
contest whether the person committed a violation set forth in a civil infraction
citation. (NRS 484A.7041) Section 1 of this bill makes certain rules of evidence
applicable to the adjudication of contested cases under the Nevada Administrative
Procedure Act applicable to any such hearing. Section 4 of this bill replaces a
requirement that, before any such hearing, the person must post a bond equal to the
amount of the full payment of the monetary penalty, administrative assessment and
any fees specified in the civil infraction citation with a requirement that the person
must post a bond of not more than that amount. Section 4 also: (1) authorizes
counsel to appear on behalf of a person who requests a hearing; and (2) provides
that if counsel appears, the person is not required to attend the hearing and is
deemed to have stipulated to his or her identity as the recipient of the civil
infraction citation. Finally, section 4 requires a court to dismiss a civil infraction
citation if the peace officer who issued the citation does not appear at the hearing or
submit a written statement, unless sufficient evidence is otherwise presented to
establish the infraction.
Under existing law, if a person is arrested for a misdemeanor offense arising
out of the same facts and circumstances as certain violations of law that are
punishable as civil infractions, the offense and the civil infraction may be included
in the same criminal complaint. (NRS 484A.7033) Section 2 of this bill instead
authorizes a court, under certain circumstances, to consolidate a criminal complaint
for a misdemeanor offense and a civil infraction. Section 2 also prescribes
procedures for holding a single, consolidated hearing and sets forth specific
requirements for such a hearing.

83rd Session (2025)

Existing law requires that civil penalties imposed for civil infractions be paid
to: (1) the treasurer of the city in which the civil infraction occurred; or (2) if the
civil infraction did not occur in a city, the treasurer of the county in which the civil
infraction occurred. (NRS 484A.7043) Section 4.5 of this bill instead requires that
civil penalties collected by a: (1) municipal court be paid to the treasurer of the city
in which the court is located; and (2) justice court be paid to the treasurer of the
county in which the court is located. Section 4.5 also prohibits a court from
awarding attorney’s fees or costs to any party in a hearing to contest a civil
infraction citation, regardless of the outcome.
Existing law: (1) authorizes a prosecuting attorney to elect to treat certain
traffic and related offenses that are punishable as a misdemeanor instead as a civil
infraction; and (2) provides a procedure for making such an election. Pursuant to
this procedure, existing law requires the prosecuting attorney to make the election
on or before the time scheduled for the first appearance of the defendant. (NRS
484A.7049) Section 5 of this bill eliminates this requirement and certain related
procedural requirements. Section 3 of this bill makes a conforming change to
remove a reference to provisions eliminated by section 5.
Under existing law, if a person commits a traffic or related offense punishable
as a civil infraction while under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance,
the person may instead be charged with a misdemeanor for the traffic or related
offense. (NRS 484A.705) Section 6 of this bill clarifies that this provision applies
when a person commits a traffic or related offense and is also charged with driving
under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance. Section 6 further requires
the misdemeanor charge to be reduced to a civil infraction if the charge of driving
under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance, is dismissed, unless the
dismissal occurs pursuant to a plea agreement.
Existing law makes it unlawful to drive a vehicle at certain speeds. Existing law
also: (1) authorizes a court, in its discretion, to reduce a violation of this prohibition
to a nonmoving violation; and (2) establishes a presumption in favor of such a
reduction if the person cited for the violation pays all applicable fines and fees
before the date on which the person is first required to appear in court relating to
the citation. (NRS 484B.600) Section 7 of this bill eliminates this presumption.

Section 2:
Section 7 instead authorizes a court, in its discretion, to reduce a moving traffic
violation for speeding to a nonmoving violation if the person cited: (1) admits to
committing the violation and pays all applicable fines and fees on or before the date
on which the person is first required to appear in court relating to the citation; and
(2) provides the court with a copy of his or her driving record. Section 7 further
prohibits a court from granting such a reduction if the driving record of the person
indicates a pattern of moving traffic violations.
Existing law also authorizes a board of county commissioners to provide a civil
penalty in lieu of a criminal penalty for the violation of certain types of ordinances.
(NRS 244.189, 244.3575, 244.359) Section 12 of this bill authorizes a board of
county commissioners to impose a civil penalty instead of a criminal penalty for the
violation of a county ordinance unless state law expressly prohibits the imposition
of a civil penalty or prescribes a criminal penalty for the same act or omission.
Existing law requires the driver of a vehicle involved in a crash to take certain
actions, which vary depending on whether the crash involves injury or death or
attended or unattended property and whether a police officer is present. (NRS
484E.020-484E.050) Sections 8-11 of this bill clarify the location-based
requirements for the responsibilities of a driver following a crash on a highway or
premises to which the public has access. Specifically, section 8 requires the driver
of a vehicle involved in such a crash that results only in damage to a vehicle or
other property driven or attended by a person to stop and, if the vehicle is
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 3 –
obstructing traffic and can be moved safely, move it to a safe location. (NRS
484E.020) Section 9 requires the driver of a vehicle involved in such a crash that
results in injury, death or damage to attended property to stop, provide certain
information, render aid if needed and report the crash to law enforcement under
certain circumstances. (NRS 484E.030) Section 10 clarifies that the duties of a
driver who is involved in a crash with unattended property apply when the crash
occurs on a highway or premises to which the public has access. (NRS 484E.040)

Section 3:
Section 11 provides that the duty to report a crash involving unattended property
applies when the crash occurs on a highway. (NRS 484E.050)

Raw Text:

Senate Bill No. 359–Committee on Judiciary
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to vehicles; revising provisions governing a
hearing to contest the determination set forth in a civil
infraction citation; authorizing a court to consolidate a
criminal complaint for a misdemeanor offense and a civil
infraction under certain circumstances; prescribing
requirements for a consolidated hearing; clarifying that
certain traffic and related offenses may be charged as
misdemeanors if committed in conjunction with driving
under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance;
requiring those offenses to be reduced to civil infractions if
the charge of driving under the influence is dismissed unless
an exception applies; revising provisions governing the
reduction of certain moving traffic violations to nonmoving
violations; authorizing a board of county commissioners to
impose a civil penalty in lieu of a criminal penalty for the
violation of a county ordinance under certain circumstances;
clarifying the locations to which certain statutory duties of a
driver involved in a crash apply; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law establishes the procedures for a hearing at which a person may
contest whether the person committed a violation set forth in a civil infraction
citation. (NRS 484A.7041) Section 1 of this bill makes certain rules of evidence
applicable to the adjudication of contested cases under the Nevada Administrative
Procedure Act applicable to any such hearing. Section 4 of this bill replaces a
requirement that, before any such hearing, the person must post a bond equal to the
amount of the full payment of the monetary penalty, administrative assessment and
any fees specified in the civil infraction citation with a requirement that the person
must post a bond of not more than that amount. Section 4 also: (1) authorizes
counsel to appear on behalf of a person who requests a hearing; and (2) provides
that if counsel appears, the person is not required to attend the hearing and is
deemed to have stipulated to his or her identity as the recipient of the civil
infraction citation. Finally, section 4 requires a court to dismiss a civil infraction
citation if the peace officer who issued the citation does not appear at the hearing or
submit a written statement, unless sufficient evidence is otherwise presented to
establish the infraction.
Under existing law, if a person is arrested for a misdemeanor offense arising
out of the same facts and circumstances as certain violations of law that are
punishable as civil infractions, the offense and the civil infraction may be included
in the same criminal complaint. (NRS 484A.7033) Section 2 of this bill instead
authorizes a court, under certain circumstances, to consolidate a criminal complaint
for a misdemeanor offense and a civil infraction. Section 2 also prescribes
procedures for holding a single, consolidated hearing and sets forth specific
requirements for such a hearing.
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 2 –
Existing law requires that civil penalties imposed for civil infractions be paid
to: (1) the treasurer of the city in which the civil infraction occurred; or (2) if the
civil infraction did not occur in a city, the treasurer of the county in which the civil
infraction occurred. (NRS 484A.7043) Section 4.5 of this bill instead requires that
civil penalties collected by a: (1) municipal court be paid to the treasurer of the city
in which the court is located; and (2) justice court be paid to the treasurer of the
county in which the court is located. Section 4.5 also prohibits a court from
awarding attorney’s fees or costs to any party in a hearing to contest a civil
infraction citation, regardless of the outcome.
Existing law: (1) authorizes a prosecuting attorney to elect to treat certain
traffic and related offenses that are punishable as a misdemeanor instead as a civil
infraction; and (2) provides a procedure for making such an election. Pursuant to
this procedure, existing law requires the prosecuting attorney to make the election
on or before the time scheduled for the first appearance of the defendant. (NRS
484A.7049) Section 5 of this bill eliminates this requirement and certain related
procedural requirements. Section 3 of this bill makes a conforming change to
remove a reference to provisions eliminated by section 5.
Under existing law, if a person commits a traffic or related offense punishable
as a civil infraction while under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance,
the person may instead be charged with a misdemeanor for the traffic or related
offense. (NRS 484A.705) Section 6 of this bill clarifies that this provision applies
when a person commits a traffic or related offense and is also charged with driving
under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance. Section 6 further requires
the misdemeanor charge to be reduced to a civil infraction if the charge of driving
under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance, is dismissed, unless the
dismissal occurs pursuant to a plea agreement.
Existing law makes it unlawful to drive a vehicle at certain speeds. Existing law
also: (1) authorizes a court, in its discretion, to reduce a violation of this prohibition
to a nonmoving violation; and (2) establishes a presumption in favor of such a
reduction if the person cited for the violation pays all applicable fines and fees
before the date on which the person is first required to appear in court relating to
the citation. (NRS 484B.600) Section 7 of this bill eliminates this presumption.
Section 7 instead authorizes a court, in its discretion, to reduce a moving traffic
violation for speeding to a nonmoving violation if the person cited: (1) admits to
committing the violation and pays all applicable fines and fees on or before the date
on which the person is first required to appear in court relating to the citation; and
(2) provides the court with a copy of his or her driving record. Section 7 further
prohibits a court from granting such a reduction if the driving record of the person
indicates a pattern of moving traffic violations.
Existing law also authorizes a board of county commissioners to provide a civil
penalty in lieu of a criminal penalty for the violation of certain types of ordinances.
(NRS 244.189, 244.3575, 244.359) Section 12 of this bill authorizes a board of
county commissioners to impose a civil penalty instead of a criminal penalty for the
violation of a county ordinance unless state law expressly prohibits the imposition
of a civil penalty or prescribes a criminal penalty for the same act or omission.
Existing law requires the driver of a vehicle involved in a crash to take certain
actions, which vary depending on whether the crash involves injury or death or
attended or unattended property and whether a police officer is present. (NRS
484E.020-484E.050) Sections 8-11 of this bill clarify the location-based
requirements for the responsibilities of a driver following a crash on a highway or
premises to which the public has access. Specifically, section 8 requires the driver
of a vehicle involved in such a crash that results only in damage to a vehicle or
other property driven or attended by a person to stop and, if the vehicle is
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 3 –
obstructing traffic and can be moved safely, move it to a safe location. (NRS
484E.020) Section 9 requires the driver of a vehicle involved in such a crash that
results in injury, death or damage to attended property to stop, provide certain
information, render aid if needed and report the crash to law enforcement under
certain circumstances. (NRS 484E.030) Section 10 clarifies that the duties of a
driver who is involved in a crash with unattended property apply when the crash
occurs on a highway or premises to which the public has access. (NRS 484E.040)
Section 11 provides that the duty to report a crash involving unattended property
applies when the crash occurs on a highway. (NRS 484E.050)

-
83rd Session (2025)

– 7 –
subsection.] Any bond posted or cash deposited with the court

with the court in accordance with this subsection.
3. The person who requested the hearing may, at his or her
expense, be represented by counsel . [, and a city attorney or district

Sec. 4.5. NRS 484A.7043 is hereby amended to read as
follows:
484A.7043 1. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a

to have committed a civil infraction would otherwise be required to
pay if the court determines that any circumstances warrant such a
waiver or reduction.
(c) Reduce any moving violation for which a person was issued
a civil infraction citation to a nonmoving violation if the court
determines that any circumstances warrant such a reduction.
5. A court shall not award attorney’s fees or costs to any
