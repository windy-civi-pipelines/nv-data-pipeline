Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes the procedures for a hearing at which a person may
2 contest whether the person committed a violation set forth in a civil infraction
3 citation. (NRS 484A.7041) Section 1 of this bill makes certain rules of evidence
4 applicable to the adjudication of contested cases under the Nevada Administrative
5 Procedure Act applicable to any such hearing. Section 4 of this bill replaces a
6 requirement that, before any such hearing, the person must post a bond equal to the
-
*SB359_R1*

– 2 –
7 amount of the full payment of the monetary penalty, administrative assessment and
8 any fees specified in the civil infraction citation with a requirement that the person
9 must post a bond of not more than that amount. Section 4 also: (1) authorizes
10 counsel to appear on behalf of a person who requests a hearing; and (2) provides
11 that if counsel appears, the person is not required to attend the hearing and is
12 deemed to have stipulated to his or her identity as the recipient of the civil
13 infraction citation. Finally, section 4 requires a court to dismiss a civil infraction
14 citation if the peace officer who issued the citation does not appear at the hearing or
15 submit a written statement, unless sufficient evidence is otherwise presented to
16 establish the infraction.
17 Under existing law, if a person is arrested for a misdemeanor offense arising
18 out of the same facts and circumstances as certain violations of law that are
19 punishable as civil infractions, the offense and the civil infraction may be included
20 in the same criminal complaint. (NRS 484A.7033) Section 2 of this bill instead
21 authorizes a court, under certain circumstances, to consolidate a criminal complaint
22 for a misdemeanor offense and a civil infraction. Section 2 also prescribes
23 procedures for holding a single, consolidated hearing and sets forth specific
24 requirements for such a hearing.
25 Existing law requires that civil penalties imposed for civil infractions be paid
26 to: (1) the treasurer of the city in which the civil infraction occurred; or (2) if the
27 civil infraction did not occur in a city, the treasurer of the county in which the civil
28 infraction occurred. (NRS 484A.7043) Section 4.5 of this bill instead requires that
29 civil penalties collected by a: (1) municipal court be paid to the treasurer of the city
30 in which the court is located; and (2) justice court be paid to the treasurer of the
31 county in which the court is located. Section 4.5 also prohibits a court from
32 awarding attorney’s fees or costs to any party in a hearing to contest a civil
33 infraction citation, regardless of the outcome.
34 Existing law: (1) authorizes a prosecuting attorney to elect to treat certain
35 traffic and related offenses that are punishable as a misdemeanor instead as a civil
36 infraction; and (2) provides a procedure for making such an election. Pursuant to
37 this procedure, existing law requires the prosecuting attorney to make the election
38 on or before the time scheduled for the first appearance of the defendant. (NRS
39 484A.7049) Section 5 of this bill eliminates this requirement and certain related
40 procedural requirements. Section 3 of this bill makes a conforming change to
41 remove a reference to provisions eliminated by section 5.
42 Under existing law, if a person commits a traffic or related offense punishable
43 as a civil infraction while under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance,
44 the person may instead be charged with a misdemeanor for the traffic or related
45 offense. (NRS 484A.705) Section 6 of this bill clarifies that this provision applies
46 when a person commits a traffic or related offense and is also charged with driving
47 under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance. Section 6 further requires
48 the misdemeanor charge to be reduced to a civil infraction if the charge of driving
49 under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance, is dismissed, unless the
50 dismissal occurs pursuant to a plea agreement.
51 Existing law makes it unlawful to drive a vehicle at certain speeds. Existing law
52 also: (1) authorizes a court, in its discretion, to reduce a violation of this prohibition
53 to a nonmoving violation; and (2) establishes a presumption in favor of such a
54 reduction if the person cited for the violation pays all applicable fines and fees
55 before the date on which the person is first required to appear in court relating to
56 the citation. (NRS 484B.600) Section 7 of this bill eliminates this presumption.
57 Section 7 instead authorizes a court, in its discretion, to reduce a moving traffic
58 violation for speeding to a nonmoving violation if the person cited: (1) admits to
59 committing the violation and pays all applicable fines and fees on or before the date
60 on which the person is first required to appear in court relating to the citation; and
61 (2) provides the court with a copy of his or her driving record. Section 7 further
-
*SB359_R1*

– 3 –
62 prohibits a court from granting such a reduction if the driving record of the person
63 indicates a pattern of moving traffic violations.
64 Existing law also authorizes a board of county commissioners to provide a civil
65 penalty in lieu of a criminal penalty for the violation of certain types of ordinances.
66 (NRS 244.189, 244.3575, 244.359) Section 12 of this bill authorizes a board of
67 county commissioners to impose a civil penalty instead of a criminal penalty for the
68 violation of a county ordinance unless state law expressly prohibits the imposition
69 of a civil penalty or prescribes a criminal penalty for the same act or omission.
70 Existing law requires the driver of a vehicle involved in a crash to take certain
71 actions, which vary depending on whether the crash involves injury or death or
72 attended or unattended property and whether a police officer is present. (NRS
73 484E.020-484E.050) Sections 8-11 of this bill clarify the location-based
74 requirements for the responsibilities of a driver following a crash on a highway or
75 premises to which the public has access. Specifically, section 8 requires the driver
76 of a vehicle involved in such a crash that results only in damage to a vehicle or
77 other property driven or attended by a person to stop and, if the vehicle is
78 obstructing traffic and can be moved safely, move it to a safe location. (NRS
79 484E.020) Section 9 requires the driver of a vehicle involved in such a crash that
80 results in injury, death or damage to attended property to stop, provide certain
81 information, render aid if needed and report the crash to law enforcement under
82 certain circumstances. (NRS 484E.030) Section 10 clarifies that the duties of a
83 driver who is involved in a crash with unattended property apply when the crash
84 occurs on a highway or premises to which the public has access. (NRS 484E.040)
85 Section 11 provides that the duty to report a crash involving unattended property
86 applies when the crash occurs on a highway. (NRS 484E.050)

15 the appellant to pay pursuant to NRS 484A.7043. Any bond must be
16 forfeited if the order of the court is affirmed on appeal; and
17 (c) If a prosecuting attorney does not represent the plaintiff

40 the person would be required to pay if the civil penalty were a fine
41 imposed on a defendant who pleads guilty or guilty but mentally ill
42 or is found guilty or guilty but mentally ill of a misdemeanor. If, in
43 lieu of a civil penalty, the court authorizes a person to successfully
44 complete a course of traffic safety approved by the Department of

26 a civil infraction citation to a nonmoving violation if the court
27 determines that any circumstances warrant such a reduction.
