(BDR 43-900)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to vehicles; revising provisions governing a
hearing to contest the determination set forth in a civil
infraction citation; requiring a misdemeanor offense and a
civil infraction to be included in the same criminal
complaint under certain circumstances; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes the procedures for a hearing at which a person may
2 contest whether the person committed a violation set forth in a civil infraction
3 citation. (NRS 484A.7041) Section 4 of this bill replaces a requirement that, before
4 any such hearing, the person must post a bond equal to the amount of the full
5 payment of the monetary penalty, administrative assessment and any fees specified
6 in the civil infraction citation with a requirement that the person must post a bond
7 of not more than that amount. Section 4 also: (1) authorizes counsel to appear on
8 behalf of a person who requests a hearing; and (2) provides that if counsel appears
9 at the hearing, the person who requested the hearing is not required to attend.
10 Section 1 of this bill makes certain rules of evidence applicable to the adjudication
11 of contested cases under the Nevada Administrative Procedure Act applicable to
12 any such hearing.
13 Under existing law, if a person is arrested for a misdemeanor offense arising
14 out of the same facts and circumstances as certain violations of law that are
15 punishable as civil infractions, the offense and the civil infraction may be included
16 in the same criminal complaint. (NRS 484A.7033) Section 2 of this bill revises this
17 provision to instead require the inclusion of both the offense and the civil infraction
18 in the same criminal complaint.
19 Existing law: (1) authorizes a prosecuting attorney to elect to treat certain
20 traffic and related offenses that are punishable as a misdemeanor instead as a civil
21 infraction; and (2) provides a procedure for making such an election. Pursuant to
22 this procedure, existing law requires the prosecuting attorney to make the election
23 on or before the time scheduled for the first appearance of the defendant.

24 (NRS 484A.7049) Section 5 of this bill eliminates this requirement and certain
25 related procedural requirements. Section 3 of this bill makes a conforming change
26 to remove a reference to provisions eliminated by section 5.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 484A of NRS is hereby amended by
2 adding thereto a new section to read as follows:
3 1. A hearing conducted pursuant to NRS 484A.7041 must be
4 conducted in accordance with the provisions of this section by a
5 qualified magistrate as specified in NRS 484A.750.

7 (a) The magistrate.
