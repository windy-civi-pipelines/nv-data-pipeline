SUMMARY—Makes various changes relating to [traffic offenses.] drivers.
(BDR 43-900)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to vehicles; revising provisions governing a hearing to contest the
determination set forth in a civil infraction citation; requiring a
misdemeanor offense and a civil infraction to be included in the same
criminal complaint under certain circumstances; clarifying the
locations to which certain statutory duties of a driver involved in a
crash apply; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes the procedures for a hearing at which a person may contest
2 whether the person committed a violation set forth in a civil infraction citation. (NRS
3 484A.7041) Section 4 of this bill replaces a requirement that, before any such hearing, the
4 person must post a bond equal to the amount of the full payment of the monetary penalty,
5 administrative assessment and any fees specified in the civil infraction citation with a
6 requirement that the person must post a bond of not more than that amount. Section 4 also: (1)
7 authorizes counsel to appear on behalf of a person who requests a hearing; and (2) provides
8 that if counsel appears at the hearing, the person who requested the hearing is not required to
9 attend. Section 1 of this bill makes certain rules of evidence applicable to the adjudication of
10 contested cases under the Nevada Administrative Procedure Act applicable to any such
11 hearing.
12 Under existing law, if a person is arrested for a misdemeanor offense arising out of the
13 same facts and circumstances as certain violations of law that are punishable as civil
14 infractions, the offense and the civil infraction may be included in the same criminal
15 complaint. (NRS 484A.7033) Section 2 of this bill revises this provision to instead require the
16 inclusion of both the offense and the civil infraction in the same criminal complaint.
17 Existing law: (1) authorizes a prosecuting attorney to elect to treat certain traffic and
18 related offenses that are punishable as a misdemeanor instead as a civil infraction; and (2)
19 provides a procedure for making such an election. Pursuant to this procedure, existing law
20 requires the prosecuting attorney to make the election on or before the time scheduled for the
21 first appearance of the defendant. (NRS 484A.7049) Section 5 of this bill eliminates this
22 requirement and certain related procedural requirements. Section 3 of this bill makes a
23 conforming change to remove a reference to provisions eliminated by section 5.
24 Existing law requires the driver of a vehicle involved in a crash to take certain
25 actions, which vary depending on whether the crash involves injury or death or attended
26 or unattended property and whether a police officer is present. (NRS 484E.020-
27 484E.050) Sections 6-9 of this bill clarify the location-based requirements for the
Assembly Amendment No. 640 to Senate Bill No. 359 Page 4
28 responsibilities of a driver following a crash on a highway or premises to which the
29 public has access. Specifically, section 6 requires the driver of a vehicle involved in such
30 a crash that results only in damage to a vehicle or other property driven or attended by
31 a person to stop and, if the vehicle is obstructing traffic and can be moved safely, move it
32 to a safe location. (NRS 484E.020) Section 7 requires the driver of a vehicle involved in
33 such a crash that results in injury, death or damage to attended property to stop,
34 provide certain information, render aid if needed and report the crash to law
35 enforcement under certain circumstances. (NRS 484E.030) Section 8 clarifies that the
36 duties of a driver who is involved in a crash with unattended property apply when the
37 crash occurs on a highway or premises to which the public has access. (NRS 484E.040)
38 Section 9 provides that the duty to report a crash involving unattended property applies
39 when the crash occurs on a highway. (NRS 484E.050)
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

8 by the person named in the citation, the court must enter an order dismissing the
9 civil infraction citation in the court’s records. If it has been established by a
10 preponderance of the evidence that the infraction was committed, the court must
11 enter in the court’s records an order pursuant to NRS 484A.7043.

22 order of the court is affirmed on appeal; and
23 (c) If a prosecuting attorney does not represent the plaintiff during the
24 proceedings in the justice court or municipal court, the appellate court shall review
25 the record and any arguments presented by the person charged with the civil
26 infraction and render a decision.

AN ACT relating to vehicles; revising provisions governing a hearing to contest the
determination set forth in a civil infraction citation; requiring a
misdemeanor offense and a civil infraction to be included in the same
criminal complaint under certain circumstances; clarifying the
locations to which certain statutory duties of a driver involved in a
crash apply; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes the procedures for a hearing at which a person may contest
2 whether the person committed a violation set forth in a civil infraction citation. (NRS
3 484A.7041) Section 4 of this bill replaces a requirement that, before any such hearing, the
4 person must post a bond equal to the amount of the full payment of the monetary penalty,
5 administrative assessment and any fees specified in the civil infraction citation with a
6 requirement that the person must post a bond of not more than that amount. Section 4 also: (1)
7 authorizes counsel to appear on behalf of a person who requests a hearing; and (2) provides
8 that if counsel appears at the hearing, the person who requested the hearing is not required to
9 attend. Section 1 of this bill makes certain rules of evidence applicable to the adjudication of
10 contested cases under the Nevada Administrative Procedure Act applicable to any such
11 hearing.
12 Under existing law, if a person is arrested for a misdemeanor offense arising out of the
13 same facts and circumstances as certain violations of law that are punishable as civil
14 infractions, the offense and the civil infraction may be included in the same criminal
15 complaint. (NRS 484A.7033) Section 2 of this bill revises this provision to instead require the
16 inclusion of both the offense and the civil infraction in the same criminal complaint.
17 Existing law: (1) authorizes a prosecuting attorney to elect to treat certain traffic and
18 related offenses that are punishable as a misdemeanor instead as a civil infraction; and (2)
19 provides a procedure for making such an election. Pursuant to this procedure, existing law
20 requires the prosecuting attorney to make the election on or before the time scheduled for the
21 first appearance of the defendant. (NRS 484A.7049) Section 5 of this bill eliminates this
22 requirement and certain related procedural requirements. Section 3 of this bill makes a
23 conforming change to remove a reference to provisions eliminated by section 5.
24 Existing law requires the driver of a vehicle involved in a crash to take certain
25 actions, which vary depending on whether the crash involves injury or death or attended
26 or unattended property and whether a police officer is present. (NRS 484E.020-
27 484E.050) Sections 6-9 of this bill clarify the location-based requirements for the

Assembly Amendment No. 640 to Senate Bill No. 359 Page 4
28 responsibilities of a driver following a crash on a highway or premises to which the
29 public has access. Specifically, section 6 requires the driver of a vehicle involved in such
30 a crash that results only in damage to a vehicle or other property driven or attended by
31 a person to stop and, if the vehicle is obstructing traffic and can be moved safely, move it
32 to a safe location. (NRS 484E.020) Section 7 requires the driver of a vehicle involved in
33 such a crash that results in injury, death or damage to attended property to stop,
34 provide certain information, render aid if needed and report the crash to law
35 enforcement under certain circumstances. (NRS 484E.030) Section 8 clarifies that the
36 duties of a driver who is involved in a crash with unattended property apply when the
37 crash occurs on a highway or premises to which the public has access. (NRS 484E.040)
38 Section 9 provides that the duty to report a crash involving unattended property applies
39 when the crash occurs on a highway. (NRS 484E.050)

22 order of the court is affirmed on appeal; and
23 (c) If a prosecuting attorney does not represent the plaintiff during the
24 proceedings in the justice court or municipal court, the appellate court shall review
25 the record and any arguments presented by the person charged with the civil
26 infraction and render a decision.
