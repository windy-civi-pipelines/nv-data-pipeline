Assembly Bill No. 36–Committee on
Health and Human Services
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to Medicaid; revising provisions relating to certain
hearings concerning actions taken against a provider of
services under the State Plan for Medicaid; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing federal and state law requires the Department of Health and Human
Services to develop and administer a State Plan for Medicaid. (42 U.S.C. § 1396a;
NRS 422.063, 422.270) Existing federal law requires a State Plan to include
provisions for the oversight of providers of services under the State Plan. (42
U.S.C. § 1396a) Existing state law: (1) authorizes such a provider of services to
request a hearing with the Division of Health Care Financing and Policy of the
Department concerning an action taken against the provider; and (2) requires the
Division to adopt regulations prescribing the procedures for such a hearing. (NRS
422.306) Existing regulations: (1) establish the actions taken against a provider for
which the provider may request a hearing; and (2) require, with certain exceptions,
that a provider submit a request for a hearing to the Division such that the Division
receives the request not later than 90 calendar days after the date of the notice of
the action for which a hearing is requested. (Medicaid Services Manual 3105.1)
Section 1 of this bill requires a provider to request a hearing not later than 90
calendar days after the date of the notice of an action against the provider, unless
the Division determines that extenuating circumstances exist. Section 1
additionally requires the Division to adopt regulations prescribing: (1) the actions
on which a provider may request a hearing; and (2) the circumstances that
constitute extenuating circumstances and which justify the submission of a request
for a hearing later than 90 calendar days after the provider receives notice of an
action against him or her. Section 2 of this bill requires the provisions of section 1,
and any regulations adopted pursuant to section 1, to apply prospectively only to
hearings requested on or after January 1, 2026.
