3 NRS 422.063, 422.270) Existing federal law requires a State Plan to include

6 request a hearing with the Division of Health Care Financing and Policy of the
7 Department concerning an action taken against the provider; and (2) requires the
8 Division to adopt regulations prescribing the procedures for such a hearing. (NRS
9 422.306) Existing regulations: (1) establish the actions taken against a provider for
10 which the provider may request a hearing; and (2) require, with certain exceptions,
11 that a provider submit a request for a hearing to the Division such that the Division
12 receives the request not later than 90 calendar days after the date of the notice of
13 the action for which a hearing is requested. (Medicaid Services Manual 3105.1)
14 Section 1 of this bill requires a provider to request a hearing not later than 90
15 calendar days after the date of the notice of an action against the provider, unless
16 the Division determines that extenuating circumstances exist. Section 1
17 additionally requires the Division to adopt regulations prescribing: (1) the actions
18 on which a provider may request a hearing; and (2) the circumstances that
19 constitute extenuating circumstances and which justify the submission of a request

23 hearings requested on or after January 1, 2026.
