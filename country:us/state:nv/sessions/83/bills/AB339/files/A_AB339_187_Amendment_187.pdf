Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates the Department of Health and Human Services, which consists of a
2 Director, various divisions, including the Division of Public and Behavioral Health and
3 Division of Child and Family Services, and certain other entities. (NRS 232.300) Section 5 of
4 this bill creates the Office of Children’s Mental and Behavioral Health within the Office of the
5 Director of the Department. Section 4 of this bill defines the term “Office” to refer to the
6 Office of Children’s Mental and Behavioral Health for the purposes of this bill, and section 8
7 of this bill applies that definition to applicable existing law. Section 5 requires [: (1)] the
8 Director of the Department to appoint a Director of the Office [;] and [(2)] prescribes the
9 qualifications of the Director of the Office. Section 5 requires the Director of the Office to
10 perform certain duties relating to the oversight of the Office. Section 6 of this bill requires the
11 Office to perform various duties relating to the mental and behavioral health of children in this
12 State. Section 7 of this bill authorizes the Office to: (1) apply for and accept gifts, grants and
13 donations; and (2) seek assistance from and cooperate with public and private entities. Section
14 7 also requires state and local governmental entities to provide the Office with such assistance

Assembly Amendment No. 187 to Assembly Bill No. 339 Page 4
15 as the Office may reasonably require in discharging its duties. Sections 11 and 12 of this bill
16 make appropriations to the Department for the personnel and operating costs of the Office and
17 the cost of procuring equipment and office supplies for the Office, respectively.
18 Section 12.3 of this bill requires the Director of the Office to: (1) begin the process of
19 establishing a Children’s Behavioral Health Center of Excellence; (2) prepare certain
20 reports documenting the progress of the Director of the Office in establishing the

22 Committee on Health and Human Services; and (4) submit to the Director of the
23 Department a final proposal for the establishment of the Center on or before June 1,
24 2026.
25 Existing law creates the Commission on Behavioral Health within the Department. (NRS
26 232.361) Existing law requires the Commission to appoint a subcommittee on the mental
27 health of children. (NRS 433.317) Existing law also: (1) establishes mental health consortia
28 for different geographic areas of this State; and (2) requires each mental health consortium to
29 prepare and submit to the Director of the Department a long-term strategic plan for the
30 provision of mental health services to children with emotional disturbance within the
31 jurisdiction of the consortium. (NRS 433B.333, 433B.335) Existing law requires the

33 of mental health services to children; and (2) review the findings and recommendations of
34 each mental health consortium. (NRS 433.317) Section 13 of this bill eliminates the
35 subcommittee. Instead, section 6 requires the Office to: (1) develop a statewide plan for the
36 provision of mental and behavioral health services to children in this State; and (2) review the
37 long-term strategic [plans,] plan, budget requests and reports of each mental health
38 consortium. Section 9 of this bill accordingly requires each mental health consortium to
39 submit to the Office its long-term strategic plan and certain other reports. Section 9 further
40 requires each consortium to collaborate with the Office as necessary to prepare and submit
41 such reports and plans. Section 10 of this bill requires each mental health consortium to
42 coordinate with the Department and the Office to avoid duplicating or contradicting the efforts
43 of the Department and the Office to provide mental health services to children. Section 1 of
44 this bill requires the Commission to: (1) coordinate with the Office regarding the mental and
45 behavioral health of children in this State; and (2) review the statewide plan developed by the
46 Office pursuant to section 6 and integrate the statewide plan into the policies established by
47 the Commission where appropriate.
48 Existing law: (1) establishes five behavioral health regions within this State; (2)
49 establishes a behavioral health policy board for each region; and (3) requires each policy
50 board to advise the Department, the Division of Public and Behavioral Health and the
51 Commission regarding, among other things, the behavioral health needs of adults and children
52 in each behavioral health region. (NRS 433.425-433.4295) Section 2 of this bill requires each
53 regional behavioral health policy board to coordinate with the Office to provide unified and
54 coordinated recommendations to the Department, Division and Commission regarding the
55 behavioral health needs of children in each behavioral health region.
