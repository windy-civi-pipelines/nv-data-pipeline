EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to broadband; establishing certain requirements
for a state agency that awards grants of federal money for
the development of broadband services and infrastructure;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes the Office of Science, Innovation and Technology in
2 the Office of the Governor and requires: (1) the Director of the Office to establish
3 and administer a program of infrastructure grants for the development or
4 improvement of broadband services for persons with low income and persons in
5 rural areas of this State; and (2) the Office to establish and administer a program to
6 encourage the deployment of broadband infrastructure in underserved communities
7 in this State. (NRS 223.600, 223.610, 223.670) Section 2 of this bill sets forth a
8 legislative declaration regarding the importance of using a well-trained workforce
9 and providing jobs to residents of this State in expending federal money to increase
10 the development of broadband services and infrastructure in this State.
11 Section 3 of this bill requires each state agency that awards grants of federal
12 money for the development of broadband services and infrastructure to: (1)
13 evaluate and assign a score to each grant application received by the state agency
14 based on the factors and relative weights assigned to each factor that the state
15 agency specified in the request for grant applications; and (2) assign a relative
16 weight of 30 percent to a grant application if the applicant submits a signed
17 certification with his or her application. Section 3 provides that the applicant must
18 certify that if the applicant or a provider of broadband services will perform some
19 or all of the work or will subcontract some or all of the work to a licensed
20 contractor, the applicant, provider or contractor: (1) meets certain safety and
21 training requirements and provides job opportunities with high-quality wages for
22 residents of this State and members of underrepresented communities; or (2) is a
23 signatory to a collective bargaining agreement that covers the direct employees of
-

– 2 –
24 the applicant who will perform any work financed in whole or in part by the grant
25 money.
26 Section 3 also provides that if an applicant or provider is a signatory to a
27 collective bargaining agreement, certain provisions of law requiring the payment of
28 prevailing wages on public works do not apply. Section 3.5 of this bill makes a
29 conforming change to provide an exception to the requirements to pay prevailing
30 wages on public works.
31 Section 3 further requires each state agency to include as a condition of any
32 grant award that: (1) the certification provided by the applicant is binding upon the
33 applicant that is awarded the grant money; and (2) if a licensed contractor performs
34 any work, certain provisions of law governing public works apply to the work
35 performed by the subcontractor. Lastly, section 3 authorizes the Director of the
36 Office to adopt regulations to carry out the provisions of section 3.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 232 of NRS is hereby amended by adding
2 thereto the provisions set forth as sections 2 and 3 of this act.
3 Sec. 2. The Legislature finds and declares that:
4 1. The State of Nevada is poised to see a once in a generation
5 wave of federal money resulting from the passage of the
6 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, Public Law 117-58, and
7 the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, Public Law 117-2, which
8 will help to close the digital divide and increase the development of
9 broadband services and infrastructure across the State;
10 2. The State of Nevada needs to ensure that this historic
11 investment creates long-lasting broadband infrastructure that is
12 built by a well-trained workforce;
13 3. Work performed by an unqualified contractor with a
14 poorly trained workforce endangers the public and is not in the
15 best interest of the citizens of this State; and
16 4. Proper stewardship of public money will require that the
17 State of Nevada implement appropriate measures to ensure that
18 any grants of federal money awarded by this State for the
19 development of broadband services and infrastructure prioritize
20 issuing grants to applicants that will ensure the work is performed
21 safely and by a well-trained workforce and that the applicant
22 provides quality jobs to Nevada workers.
23 Sec. 3. 1. In awarding any grant of federal money for the
24 development of broadband services and infrastructure in
25 accordance with federal law, each state agency shall:
26 (a) Evaluate and assign a score to each application received by
27 the state agency based on the factors and relative weights assigned
28 to each factor that the state agency specified in the request for
29 grant applications; and
-
*SB384_R2*

– 3 –

2 percent to an application if the applicant submits a signed

6 development of broadband services and infrastructure shall
7 submit to a state agency with the application for the grant a signed
8 statement certifying that:

10 (1) Will perform some or all of the work that is financed in
11 whole or in part with the grant money or if such work will be
12 performed by a provider of broadband services, the applicant or
13 provider, as applicable, meets the requirements set forth in
14 paragraph (b) or (c); and
15 (2) Will subcontract some or all of the work that is financed
16 in whole or in part with the grant money, the subcontractor meets
17 the requirements set forth in paragraph (b) or (c);

28 contractor, as applicable, that is financed in whole or in part with

32 benefits;
33 (4) Has programs to promote the training and hiring of
34 workers from underrepresented communities; and
35 (5) Primarily employs a qualified local work force
36 consisting of residents of this State or conducts a program to
37 promote the hiring of residents of this State; or
38 (c) The applicant, provider of broadband services or contractor
39 licensed pursuant to chapter 624 of NRS that will perform some or
40 all of the work is a signatory to a collective bargaining agreement
41 that covers all non-supervisory employees directly employed by the
42 applicant, provider or contractor, as applicable, who will perform
43 any work financed in whole or in part with the grant money.

19 apply.
20 6. If any federal statute or regulation precludes the granting
21 of federal assistance or reduces the amount of that assistance for a
22 particular grant because of the provisions of this section, the
23 provisions of this section do not apply insofar as their application
24 would preclude or reduce federal assistance for that work.
