AN ACT relating to civil liability; providing immunity from civil liability to the
State of Nevada, certain institutions of higher education and certain
officers or employees thereof under certain circumstances; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, the State of Nevada: (1) waives its immunity from liability in civil
2 actions; and (2) consents to have its liability determined in accordance with the same rules of
3 law governing civil actions against natural persons and corporations. (NRS 41.031) Existing
4 law creates certain exceptions to this waiver of immunity from liability, thereby providing
5 immunity from liability to certain state actors under certain circumstances. (NRS 41.032-
6 41.036) Section 1 of this bill provides that the State, any university, state college or
7 community college which is part of the Nevada System of Higher Education and any officer
8 or employee thereof are immune from civil liability for any damages sustained as a result of
9 certain acts or omissions of the State, institution of higher education, officer or employee in
10 response to or on the basis of the public-health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
11 Section 2 of this bill provides that the State retains its immunity from liability in cases where
12 immunity is granted under section 1. Section 3 of this bill provides that the immunity from
13 liability granted by section 1 applies retroactively to any action commenced on or after March
14 12, 2020, for which a final judgment has not been rendered. Section 4 of this bill provides that
15 the immunity from liability granted by section 1 expires by limitation on June 30, 2030.
