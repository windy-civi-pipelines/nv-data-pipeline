AN ACT relating to taxation; providing for the imposition,
administration, collection and enforcement of a tax on
certain digital products electronically transferred to a
purchaser; providing penalties; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Sections 24 and 33 of this bill impose a tax on a retail sale in this State of
2 specified digital products electronically transferred to a person and on the use of
3 specified digital products electronically transferred to a person in a transaction in
4 this State for which the tax was not collected at the time of sale. Section 23 of this
5 bill establishes requirements for determining the place where a sale of specified
6 digital products takes place for the purpose of the tax. Under sections 24 and 33,
7 the rate of the tax is the same as the sales and use tax rate imposed in the county in
8 which the sale of the specified digital products takes place, as determined pursuant
9 to section 23. Under section 100 of this bill, the requirement to impose, collect and
10 remit the tax is imposed on a retailer who does not maintain a place of business in
11 this State if, in the immediately preceding calendar year or the current calendar
12 year, the retailer had more than $100,000 of gross revenue from certain transactions
13 that took place in this State or 200 or more such transactions that took place in this
14 State. Sections 1-22, 25-32, 34-99 and 101-127 of this bill provide for the
15 administration, collection and enforcement of the tax in the same manner as
16 the sales and use tax. Section 130 of this bill establishes January 1, 2026, as the
17 effective date of this bill.
18 Section 94 requires a person who directly or indirectly facilitates retail sales of
19 specified digital products to collect and remit the tax if, in the immediately
20 preceding calendar year or the current calendar year, the facilitator had more than
21 $100,000 of gross receipts from certain transactions made to customers in this State

22 or made or facilitated 200 or more transactions, on its own behalf or on behalf of a
23 seller, unless the facilitator enters into an agreement with a seller whereby the seller
24 agrees to assume responsibility for the collection and imposition of the tax. Section
25 95 provides that such a facilitator is not liable for the payment of the tax under
26 certain circumstances.
27 Section 96 requires certain persons who receive a fee in exchange for listing or
28 advertising a product for a seller but do not collect money or other consideration
29 from a customer to impose, collect and remit the tax if 200 or more retail sales to
30 customers in this State result from referrals made by the person or the cumulative
31 gross receipts of sales resulting from such referrals exceed $100,000, unless the
32 person complies with certain notice requirements and makes a monthly report to the
33 Department of Taxation.

24 of specified digital products is not a sale at retail is upon the

26 purchaser a certificate to the effect that the specified digital
27 products were purchased by an end user and the purchaser:
28 1. Is engaged in the business of commercial broadcasting,

41 1. Be substantially in such form and include such
42 information as the Department may prescribe; and
43 2. Unless submitted in electronic form, be signed by the
44 purchaser.
-
*SB392*
– 10 –
1 Sec. 31. 1. If a purchaser who gives a resale certificate
2 makes any use of specified digital products other than the
3 commercial broadcasting, rebroadcasting, transmitting,

5 or exhibiting of the specified digital products, in whole or in part,
6 to another person or persons in the regular course of business:

16 solicited the purchaser to provide the resale certificate unlawfully.
17 2. As used in this section, “seller” includes a certified service
18 provider, as that term is defined in NRS 360B.060, acting on

20 Sec. 32. Any person who gives a resale certificate for
21 specified digital products which the person knows at the time of
22 purchase is not to be further broadcast, rebroadcast, transmitted,
23 retransmitted, licensed, relicensed, distributed, redistributed or
24 exhibited by the person in the regular course of business for the
25 purpose of evading payment to the seller of the amount of the tax
26 applicable to the transaction is guilty of a misdemeanor.
27 Sec. 33. 1. An excise tax is hereby imposed on the use in
28 this State of specified digital products purchased and
29 electronically transferred from any retailer on or after January 1,
30 2026, for use in this State at a rate equal to the sum of the rates of
31 all taxes imposed upon the storage, use or other consumption of
32 tangible personal property in the county in which the use of the
33 specific digital products occurs.
34 2. The tax imposed by subsection 1 applies whether the
35 purchaser obtains permanent use or less than permanent use of
36 the specified digital product, whether the sale is conditioned or not
37 conditioned upon continued payment from the purchaser and
38 whether the sale is on a subscription basis or is not on a
39 subscription basis.
40 3. The tax is imposed with respect to all specified digital
41 products which were electronically transferred in a transaction
42 that is taxable pursuant to this chapter but for which the tax
43 imposed by section 24 of this act was not collected.
44 Sec. 34. Every person storing, using or otherwise consuming
45 in this State specified digital products purchased from a retailer is
-
*SB392*
– 11 –
1 liable for the tax. The liability of a person pursuant to this section
2 is not extinguished until the tax has been paid to this State, except

4 section 35 of this act is sufficient to relieve the purchaser from
5 further liability for the tax to which the receipt refers.
6 Sec. 35. Every retailer maintaining a place of business in
7 this State and making sales of specified digital products for use in
8 this State, not exempted by this chapter, shall, at the time of

11 collect the tax from the purchaser and give to the purchaser a
12 receipt therefor in the manner and form prescribed by the Nevada
13 Tax Commission.
14 Sec. 36. The tax required to be collected by the retailer
15 constitutes a debt owed by the retailer to this State.
16 Sec. 37. It is unlawful for any retailer to advertise or hold
17 out or state to the public or to any customer, directly or indirectly,
18 that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the
19 retailer or that it will not be added to the selling price of the
20 specified digital products sold or that, if added, it or any part
21 thereof will be refunded.
22 Sec. 38. The tax required pursuant to this chapter to be
23 collected by the retailer from the purchaser must be displayed
24 separately from the list price, the price advertised in the premises,
25 the marked price, or any other price on the sales check or other
26 proof of sale.
27 Sec. 39. Any person who violates section 35, 37 or 38 of this
28 act is guilty of a misdemeanor.

32 ending on the last day of March, June, September and December.

S.B. 392
SENATE BILL NO. 392–SENATOR NEAL
MARCH 17, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Revenue and
Economic Development
SUMMARY—Imposes a tax on the retail sale of certain digital
products. (BDR 32-700)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: Increases or Newly
Provides for Term of Imprisonment in County or City
Jail or Detention Facility.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to taxation; providing for the imposition,
administration, collection and enforcement of a tax on
certain digital products electronically transferred to a
purchaser; providing penalties; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Sections 24 and 33 of this bill impose a tax on a retail sale in this State of
2 specified digital products electronically transferred to a person and on the use of
3 specified digital products electronically transferred to a person in a transaction in
4 this State for which the tax was not collected at the time of sale. Section 23 of this
5 bill establishes requirements for determining the place where a sale of specified
6 digital products takes place for the purpose of the tax. Under sections 24 and 33,
7 the rate of the tax is the same as the sales and use tax rate imposed in the county in
8 which the sale of the specified digital products takes place, as determined pursuant
9 to section 23. Under section 100 of this bill, the requirement to impose, collect and
10 remit the tax is imposed on a retailer who does not maintain a place of business in
11 this State if, in the immediately preceding calendar year or the current calendar
12 year, the retailer had more than $100,000 of gross revenue from certain transactions
13 that took place in this State or 200 or more such transactions that took place in this
14 State. Sections 1-22, 25-32, 34-99 and 101-127 of this bill provide for the
15 administration, collection and enforcement of the tax in the same manner as
16 the sales and use tax. Section 130 of this bill establishes January 1, 2026, as the
17 effective date of this bill.
18 Section 94 requires a person who directly or indirectly facilitates retail sales of
19 specified digital products to collect and remit the tax if, in the immediately
20 preceding calendar year or the current calendar year, the facilitator had more than
21 $100,000 of gross receipts from certain transactions made to customers in this State
-
*SB392*

– 2 –
22 or made or facilitated 200 or more transactions, on its own behalf or on behalf of a
23 seller, unless the facilitator enters into an agreement with a seller whereby the seller
24 agrees to assume responsibility for the collection and imposition of the tax. Section
25 95 provides that such a facilitator is not liable for the payment of the tax under
26 certain circumstances.
27 Section 96 requires certain persons who receive a fee in exchange for listing or
28 advertising a product for a seller but do not collect money or other consideration
29 from a customer to impose, collect and remit the tax if 200 or more retail sales to
30 customers in this State result from referrals made by the person or the cumulative
31 gross receipts of sales resulting from such referrals exceed $100,000, unless the
32 person complies with certain notice requirements and makes a monthly report to the
33 Department of Taxation.

2 the retail sale of the specified digital goods takes place, as
3 determined pursuant to section 23 of this act, multiplied by the

5 2. The tax imposed by subsection 1 applies whether the
6 purchaser obtains permanent use or less than permanent use of
7 the specified digital product, whether the sale is conditioned or not
8 conditioned upon continued payment from the purchaser and
9 whether the sale is on a subscription basis or is not on a
10 subscription basis.
11 Sec. 25. The tax imposed by section 24 of this act must be
12 collected by the retailer from the end user insofar as it can be
13 done.
14 Sec. 26. 1. It is unlawful for any retailer to advertise or
15 hold out or state to the public or to any customer, directly
16 or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or
17 absorbed by the retailer or that it will not be added to the selling
18 price of the specified digital products sold or that, if added, it or
19 any part thereof will be refunded.
20 2. Any person violating any provision of this section is guilty
21 of a misdemeanor.
22 Sec. 27. 1. A person shall not engage in or conduct

27 2. Every application for a permit must:
28 (a) Be made upon a form prescribed by the Department.
29 (b) Set forth the name under which the applicant transacts or
30 intends to transact business and the location of the applicant’s
31 place or places of business.

33 require.
34 (d) Be accompanied by a fee of $5.
35 (e) Be signed by:

*SB392*

– 9 –
1 or suspend any one or more of the permits held by the person.
2 Before doing so, the Department must hold a hearing after giving
3 10 days’ written notice to the holder of the permit. The notice must
4 specify the time and place of the hearing and require the holder of
5 the permit to show cause why the permit should not be suspended
6 or revoked.
7 2. If a permit is suspended or revoked, the Department must
8 give written notice of the action to the holder of the permit.
9 3. The notices required by this section may be served
10 personally or by mail in the manner prescribed for service of
11 notice of a deficiency determination.
12 4. The Department shall not issue a new permit after the
13 revocation of a permit unless the Department is satisfied that the
14 former holder of the permit will comply with the provisions of this
15 chapter and the regulations of the Department adopted pursuant
16 thereto.
17 5. A retailer whose permit has been suspended or revoked
18 must pay the Department a fee of $5 for the reinstatement of the
19 permit or the issuance of a new permit.
20 Sec. 29. For the purpose of the proper administration of this
21 chapter and to prevent evasion of the tax imposed by section 24 of
22 this act, it is presumed that all gross receipts are subject to the tax
23 until the contrary is established. The burden of proving that a sale
24 of specified digital products is not a sale at retail is upon the
25 person who makes the sale unless the person takes from the
26 purchaser a certificate to the effect that the specified digital
27 products were purchased by an end user and the purchaser:
28 1. Is engaged in the business of commercial broadcasting,
29 rebroadcasting, transmitting, retransmitting, licensing,
30 relicensing, distributing, redistributing or exhibiting specified
31 digital products, in whole or in part, to another person or persons;

39 be used for such a purpose or will be used for some other purpose.
40 Sec. 30. A resale certificate must:
41 1. Be substantially in such form and include such
42 information as the Department may prescribe; and
43 2. Unless submitted in electronic form, be signed by the
44 purchaser.
-

1 Sec. 31. 1. If a purchaser who gives a resale certificate

5 2. One or more deficiency determinations may be made with
6 respect to the amount due for one or for more than one period.
7 3. In making its determination of the amount required to be
8 paid, the Department shall impose interest on the amount of tax

10 forth in NRS 360.417, unless a different rate of interest is
11 specifically provided by statute.

20 Sec. 121. NRS 360.417 is hereby amended to read as follows:
21 360.417 Except as otherwise provided in NRS 360.232 and
22 360.320, and unless a different penalty or rate of interest is
23 specifically provided by statute, any person who fails to pay any tax
24 provided for in chapter 362, 363A, 363B, 363C, 363D, 369, 370,
25 372, 372B, 374, 377, 377A, 377C, 377D, 444A or 585 of NRS [,] or
26 sections 2 to 117, inclusive, of this act, any of the taxes provided
27 for in NRS 372A.290, or any fee provided for in NRS 482.313,
28 482C.230 or 482C.240, and any person or governmental entity that
29 fails to pay any fee provided for in NRS 360.787, to the State or a
30 county within the time required, shall pay a penalty of not more than
31 10 percent of the amount of the tax or fee which is owed, as
32 determined by the Department, in addition to the tax or fee, plus
33 interest at the rate of 0.75 percent per month, or fraction of a month,
34 from the last day of the month following the period for which the
35 amount or any portion of the amount should have been reported
36 until the date of payment. The amount of any penalty imposed must
37 be based on a graduated schedule adopted by the Nevada Tax
38 Commission which takes into consideration the length of time the
39 tax or fee remained unpaid.
40 Sec. 122. NRS 360.510 is hereby amended to read as follows:
41 360.510 1. If any person is delinquent in the payment of any

44 Department may:
-
*SB392*

– 43 –
1 (a) Not later than 3 years after the payment became delinquent
2 or the determination became final; or
3 (b) Not later than 6 years after the last recording of an abstract
4 of judgment or of a certificate constituting a lien for tax owed,
5  give a notice of the delinquency and a demand to transmit
6 personally or by registered or certified mail to any person,
7 including, without limitation, any officer or department of this State
8 or any political subdivision or agency of this State, who has in his or
9 her possession or under his or her control any credits or other
10 personal property belonging to the delinquent, or owing any debts to
11 the delinquent or person against whom a determination has been
12 made which remains unpaid, or owing any debts to the delinquent or
13 that person. In the case of any state officer, department or agency,
14 the notice must be given to the officer, department or agency before
15 the Department presents the claim of the delinquent taxpayer to the
16 State Controller.
17 2. A state officer, department or agency which receives such a
18 notice may satisfy any debt owed to it by that person before it
19 honors the notice of the Department.
20 3. After receiving the demand to transmit, the person notified
21 by the demand may not transfer or otherwise dispose of the credits,
22 other personal property, or debts in his or her possession or under
23 his or her control at the time the person received the notice until the
24 Department consents to a transfer or other disposition.
25 4. Every person notified by a demand to transmit shall, within
26 10 days after receipt of the demand to transmit, inform the
27 Department of and transmit to the Department all such credits, other
28 personal property or debts in his or her possession, under his or her
29 control or owing by that person within the time and in the manner
30 requested by the Department. Except as otherwise provided in
31 subsection 5, no further notice is required to be served to that
32 person.
33 5. If the property of the delinquent taxpayer consists of a series
34 of payments owed to him or her, the person who owes or controls
35 the payments shall transmit the payments to the Department until
36 otherwise notified by the Department. If the debt of the delinquent
37 taxpayer is not paid within 1 year after the Department issued the
38 original demand to transmit, the Department shall issue another
39 demand to transmit to the person responsible for making the
40 payments informing him or her to continue to transmit payments to
41 the Department or that his or her duty to transmit the payments to
42 the Department has ceased.
43 6. If the notice of the delinquency seeks to prevent the transfer
44 or other disposition of a deposit in a bank or credit union or other
45 credits or personal property in the possession or under the control of
-
*SB392*

– 44 –
1 a bank, credit union or other depository institution, the notice must
2 be delivered or mailed to any branch or office of the bank, credit
3 union or other depository institution at which the deposit is carried
4 or at which the credits or personal property is held.
5 7. If any person notified by the notice of the delinquency
6 makes any transfer or other disposition of the property or debts
7 required to be withheld or transmitted, to the extent of the value of
8 the property or the amount of the debts thus transferred or paid, that
9 person is liable to the State for any indebtedness due pursuant to this
10 chapter, chapter 360B, 362, 363A, 363B, 363C, 363D, 369, 370,

12 NRS 482.313, 482C.230 or 482C.240, or chapter 585 or 680B of
13 NRS or sections 2 to 117, inclusive, of this act from the person with
14 respect to whose obligation the notice was given if solely by reason
15 of the transfer or other disposition the State is unable to recover the
16 indebtedness of the person with respect to whose obligation the
17 notice was given.
18 Sec. 123. Chapter 360B of NRS is hereby amended by adding
