SUMMARY—Revises provisions governing contractors who
perform work on residential photovoltaic systems
used to produce electricity. (BDR 54-253)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to contractors; requiring, rather than authorizing
the State Contractors’ Board to require, a contractor who
performs work concerning a residential photovoltaic
system used to produce electricity to obtain a performance
bond and payment bond before commencing the work;
revising requirements for such bonds; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the State Contractors’ Board to require a contractor
2 who performs work concerning a residential photovoltaic system used to produce
3 electricity, before commencing the work, to obtain a performance bond and
4 payment bond in an amount equal to not less than 50 percent of the amount of the
5 contract if the contractor: (1) is determined by the Board to have committed certain
6 violations; (2) enters into a contract that is later voided by the owner of the single-
7 family residence on which the work is performed; or (3) has five valid complaints
8 filed against him or her with the Board within a 15-day period. (NRS 624.270)
9 Rather than authorizing the Board to require a contractor who performs work
10 concerning a residential photovoltaic system used to produce electricity to obtain a
11 performance bond and payment bond before commencing the work only under
12 certain circumstances, section 1 of this bill instead requires all contractors who
13 perform work concerning a residential photovoltaic system used to produce
14 electricity to obtain a performance bond and payment bond before commencing the
15 work. Section 1 also increases the amount of each of the required bonds to an
16 amount equal to not less than 100 percent of the amount of the contract. Section 1
-
*AB5*
– 2 –
17 additionally requires the bonds to be issued by a surety which is included in the
18 United States Department of the Treasury’s Listing of Approved Sureties.
19 Section 2 of this bill provides that the revised requirements for bonds set forth
20 in section 1 do not apply to a contractor whose license authorizing the contractor to
21 perform work concerning a residential photovoltaic system used to produce
22 electricity was issued before July 1, 2025, until the date on which the license is
23 renewed, unless the contractor: (1) is determined by the Board to have committed
24 certain violations; (2) enters into a contract on or after July 1, 2025, that is later
25 voided by the owner of the single-family residence on which the work is
26 performed; or (3) has five valid complaints filed against him or her with the Board
27 within a 15-day period.
