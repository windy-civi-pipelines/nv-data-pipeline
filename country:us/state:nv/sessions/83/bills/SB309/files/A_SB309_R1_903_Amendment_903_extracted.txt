~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to crimes; revising provisions relating to [prohibited acts
concerning the use] driving under the influence of alcohol [,
marijuana and] or certain other prohibited substances; providing
penalties; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 [Existing law prohibits a person from driving or physically controlling a vehicle or
2 operating or physically controlling a vessel under certain circumstances if the person has
3 specified amounts of certain prohibited substances in his or her blood or urine. (NRS
4 484C.110, 488.410) Sections 5 and 15 of this bill additionally prohibit a person from driving
5 or physically controlling a vehicle or operating or physically controlling a vessel with specific
6 amounts of fentanyl in his or her blood or urine. Section 3 of this bill makes a conforming
7 change to include fentanyl in the definition of “prohibited substance.”]
8 Existing law establishes various penalties applicable to the offense of driving or
9 physically controlling a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a prohibited substance,
10 depending on whether the offense is the first, second or third offense within 7 years. (NRS
11 484C.400) Among other things, a court may sentence a person who is found guilty of a second
12 offense within 7 years to: (1) imprisonment for not less than 10 days nor more than 6 months
13 in jail; or (2) residential confinement for not less than 10 days nor more than 6 months.
14 Section 12 of this bill increases the minimum term of imprisonment or residential
15 confinement to 20 days.
16 Existing law requires an offender who had a concentration of alcohol of 0.18 or more in
17 his or her blood or breath at the time of an offense to be evaluated before sentencing to
18 determine whether the offender has an alcohol or substance use disorder. (NRS 484C.350)
19 Section 11 of this bill reduces the concentration of alcohol threshold to require an offender
20 who had a concentration of alcohol of 0.16 or more in his or her blood or breath at the time of
21 the offense to be evaluated for an alcohol or substance use disorder. Sections 1, 9 and 12 of
22 this bill make conforming changes to reduce references to the concentration of alcohol from
23 0.18 to 0.16. Section 38 of this bill makes a technical change to repeal a definition that is not
24 used in chapter 484C of NRS.
25 Additionally, existing law, under certain circumstances, authorizes certain first, second
26 and third-time offenders to apply to the court to undergo a program of treatment for an alcohol
27 or other substance use disorder. (NRS 484C.320, 484C.330, 484C.340) Existing law prohibits
28 an offender from applying to undergo such a program for third-time offenders if the offender
29 has previously applied to receive such treatment or has previously been convicted of certain
Senate Amendment No. 903 to Senate Bill No. 309 First Reprint Page 4
30 offenses. (NRS 484C.340) Section 10 of this bill removes the restriction related to previous
31 applications by a third-time offender to undergo such a program and instead prohibits the
32 offender from applying to undergo such a program if the offender has previously been ordered
33 to complete a program of treatment for third-time offenders.
34 For the purposes of determining whether a person that drives or physically controls a
35 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a prohibited substance is a first, second or
36 third-time offender, existing law qualifies an offense as a prior offense if it is: (1) evidenced
37 by a conviction; or (2) conditionally dismissed or the judgment of conviction is set aside or
38 dismissed in connection with successful completion of a diversionary program or specialty
39 court program. (NRS 484C.400) Section 12 additionally provides that an offense qualifies as
40 a prior offense if the person is undergoing a program of treatment for an alcohol or substance
41 use disorder for a first, second or third-time offender.
42 Existing law establishes a penalty that is applicable to a person who has previously
43 committed certain felonies related to driving under the influence of alcohol or a prohibited
44 substance and who subsequently commits the offense of driving or physically controlling a
45 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a prohibited substance. (NRS 484C.410)
46 Section 13 of this bill additionally applies this penalty to a person who is undergoing a
47 program of treatment for an alcohol or substance use disorder for a third-time offender, if the
48 person subsequently commits the offense of driving or physically controlling a vehicle while
49 under the influence of alcohol or a prohibited substance.

MARCH 10, 2025
_______________
Referred to Committee on Growth and Infrastructure
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to crimes. (BDR 43-906)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: Increases or Newly Provides for
Term of Imprisonment in County or City Jail or Detention
Facility.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to crimes; revising provisions relating to [prohibited acts
concerning the use] driving under the influence of alcohol [,
marijuana and] or certain other prohibited substances; providing
penalties; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 [Existing law prohibits a person from driving or physically controlling a vehicle or
2 operating or physically controlling a vessel under certain circumstances if the person has
3 specified amounts of certain prohibited substances in his or her blood or urine. (NRS
4 484C.110, 488.410) Sections 5 and 15 of this bill additionally prohibit a person from driving
5 or physically controlling a vehicle or operating or physically controlling a vessel with specific
6 amounts of fentanyl in his or her blood or urine. Section 3 of this bill makes a conforming
7 change to include fentanyl in the definition of “prohibited substance.”]
8 Existing law establishes various penalties applicable to the offense of driving or
9 physically controlling a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a prohibited substance,
10 depending on whether the offense is the first, second or third offense within 7 years. (NRS
11 484C.400) Among other things, a court may sentence a person who is found guilty of a second
12 offense within 7 years to: (1) imprisonment for not less than 10 days nor more than 6 months
13 in jail; or (2) residential confinement for not less than 10 days nor more than 6 months.
14 Section 12 of this bill increases the minimum term of imprisonment or residential
15 confinement to 20 days.
16 Existing law requires an offender who had a concentration of alcohol of 0.18 or more in
17 his or her blood or breath at the time of an offense to be evaluated before sentencing to
18 determine whether the offender has an alcohol or substance use disorder. (NRS 484C.350)
19 Section 11 of this bill reduces the concentration of alcohol threshold to require an offender
20 who had a concentration of alcohol of 0.16 or more in his or her blood or breath at the time of
21 the offense to be evaluated for an alcohol or substance use disorder. Sections 1, 9 and 12 of
22 this bill make conforming changes to reduce references to the concentration of alcohol from
23 0.18 to 0.16. Section 38 of this bill makes a technical change to repeal a definition that is not
24 used in chapter 484C of NRS.
25 Additionally, existing law, under certain circumstances, authorizes certain first, second
26 and third-time offenders to apply to the court to undergo a program of treatment for an alcohol
27 or other substance use disorder. (NRS 484C.320, 484C.330, 484C.340) Existing law prohibits
28 an offender from applying to undergo such a program for third-time offenders if the offender
29 has previously applied to receive such treatment or has previously been convicted of certain

Senate Amendment No. 903 to Senate Bill No. 309 First Reprint Page 4
30 offenses. (NRS 484C.340) Section 10 of this bill removes the restriction related to previous
31 applications by a third-time offender to undergo such a program and instead prohibits the
32 offender from applying to undergo such a program if the offender has previously been ordered
33 to complete a program of treatment for third-time offenders.
34 For the purposes of determining whether a person that drives or physically controls a
35 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a prohibited substance is a first, second or
36 third-time offender, existing law qualifies an offense as a prior offense if it is: (1) evidenced
37 by a conviction; or (2) conditionally dismissed or the judgment of conviction is set aside or
38 dismissed in connection with successful completion of a diversionary program or specialty
39 court program. (NRS 484C.400) Section 12 additionally provides that an offense qualifies as
40 a prior offense if the person is undergoing a program of treatment for an alcohol or substance
41 use disorder for a first, second or third-time offender.
42 Existing law establishes a penalty that is applicable to a person who has previously
43 committed certain felonies related to driving under the influence of alcohol or a prohibited
44 substance and who subsequently commits the offense of driving or physically controlling a
45 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a prohibited substance. (NRS 484C.410)
46 Section 13 of this bill additionally applies this penalty to a person who is undergoing a
47 program of treatment for an alcohol or substance use disorder for a third-time offender, if the
48 person subsequently commits the offense of driving or physically controlling a vehicle while
49 under the influence of alcohol or a prohibited substance.
