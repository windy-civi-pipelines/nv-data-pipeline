Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits a person from driving or physically controlling a vehicle or operating
2 or physically controlling a vessel under certain circumstances if the person has specified amounts
3 of certain prohibited substances in his or her blood or urine. (NRS 484C.110, 488.410) Sections
4 5 and 15 of this bill additionally prohibit a person from driving or physically controlling a
5 vehicle or operating or physically controlling a vessel with specific amounts of fentanyl [or
6 methylenedioxymethamphetamine] in his or her blood or urine. Section 3 of this bill makes a
7 conforming change to include fentanyl [and methylenedioxymethamphetamine] in the definition
8 of “prohibited substance.”
9 [Existing law also prohibits a person from driving or physically controlling a vehicle or
10 operating or physically controlling a vessel under certain circumstances if the person has
11 specific amounts of marijuana or marijuana metabolite in his or her blood and the offense is
12 punishable as a felony. (NRS 484C.110, 484C.400, 488.410, 488.427) Sections 5 and 15
13 expand the applicability of the prohibition concerning the specific amounts of marijuana and
14 marijuana metabolite, thereby making the prohibition also applicable to offenses punishable as
15 a misdemeanor.
16 Additionally, existing law prohibits a person from driving or physically controlling a
17 vehicle or operating or physically controlling a vessel under certain circumstances if the
18 person is found by a measurement within 2 hours after driving or physically controlling the
19 vehicle or operating or physically controlling the vessel to have a concentration of alcohol of
20 0.08 or more on his or her breath, or 0.04 or more but less than 0.08 for commercial motor
21 vehicles. (NRS 484C.110, 484C.120, 484C.130, 484C.430, 488.410, 488.420, 488.425)
22 Sections 5-7 and 14-17 of this bill make various changes to account for the circumstance
23 under which a person drives or physically controls a vehicle or operates or physically controls
24 a vessel under certain circumstances and is found, after being involved in a crash or collision,
25 as applicable, to have the specified concentration of alcohol on his or her breath. Sections 19-
26 23, 28, 29 and 31 of this bill make conforming changes to account for certain organizational

Senate Amendment No. 247 to Senate Bill No. 309 Page 4
27 changes made in section 5. Section 4 of this bill makes certain changes concerning when a
28 person is presumed to be in physical control of a vehicle involved in a crash.]
29 Existing law establishes various penalties applicable to the offense of driving or
30 physically controlling a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a prohibited substance,
31 depending on whether the offense is the first, second or third offense within 7 years. (NRS
32 484C.400) Among other things, a court may sentence a person who is found guilty of a
33 second offense within 7 years to: (1) imprisonment for not less than 10 days nor more
34 than 6 months in jail; or (2) residential confinement for not less than 10 days nor more
35 than 6 months. Section 12 of this bill [makes various changes to increase certain penalties
36 and other sanctions applicable to a first or second offense.] increases the minimum term of
37 imprisonment or residential confinement to 20 days.
38 Existing law requires an offender who had a concentration of alcohol of 0.18 or more in
39 his or her blood or breath at the time of an offense to be evaluated before sentencing to
40 determine whether the offender has an alcohol or substance use disorder. (NRS 484C.350)
41 Section 11 of this bill reduces the concentration of alcohol threshold to require an offender
42 who had a concentration of alcohol of 0.16 or more in his or her blood or breath at the time of
43 the offense to be evaluated for an alcohol or substance use disorder. Sections 1, [2 and] 9 and
44 12 of this bill make conforming changes to reduce references to the concentration of alcohol
45 from 0.18 to 0.16. Section 38 of this bill makes a technical change to repeal a definition
46 that is not used in chapter 484C of NRS.
47 Additionally, existing law, under certain circumstances, authorizes certain first, second
48 and third-time offenders to apply to the court to undergo a program of treatment for an alcohol
49 or other substance use disorder. (NRS 484C.320, 484C.330, 484C.340) Existing law prohibits
50 an offender from applying to undergo such a program for third-time offenders if the offender
51 has previously applied to receive such treatment or has previously been convicted of certain
52 offenses. (NRS 484C.340) Section 10 of this bill removes the restriction related to previous
53 applications by a third-time offender to undergo such a program and instead prohibits the
54 offender from applying to undergo such a program if the offender has previously been ordered
55 to complete a program of treatment for third-time offenders.
56 For the purposes of determining whether a person that drives or physically controls a
57 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a prohibited substance is a first, second or
58 third-time offender, existing law qualifies an offense as a prior offense if it is: (1) evidenced
59 by a conviction; or (2) conditionally dismissed or the judgment of conviction is set aside or
60 dismissed in connection with successful completion of a diversionary program or specialty
61 court program. (NRS 484C.400) Section 12 [of this bill] additionally provides that an offense
62 qualifies as a prior offense if the person is undergoing a program of treatment for an alcohol
63 or substance use disorder for a first, second or third-time offender.
64 Existing law establishes a penalty that is applicable to a person who has previously
65 committed certain felonies related to driving under the influence of alcohol or a prohibited
66 substance and who subsequently commits the offense of driving or physically controlling a
67 vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a prohibited substance. (NRS 484C.410)
68 Section 13 of this bill additionally applies this penalty to a person who is undergoing a
69 program of treatment for an alcohol or substance use disorder for a third-time offender, if the
70 person subsequently commits the offense of driving or physically controlling a vehicle while
71 under the influence of alcohol or a prohibited substance.
72 [Existing law requires certain conduct related to driving under the influence of alcohol or
73 a prohibited substance to have taken place “on a highway or on premises to which the public
74 has access.” (NRS 484C.110, 484C.120, 484C.150, 484C.160) Existing law also requires
75 certain other conduct related to driving under the influence of alcohol or a prohibited
76 substance to have taken place “on or off the highways of this State.” (NRS 484C.130,
77 484C.430) Sections 7 and 14 of this bill replace the phrase “on or off the highways of this
78 State” with “on a highway or premises to which the public has access” for consistency
79 throughout provisions governing driving under the influence of alcohol or a prohibited
80 substance.
81 Existing law provides that a blood test related to a person accused of driving or physically
82 controlling a vehicle or operating or physically controlling a vessel while under the influence
83 of alcohol or a prohibited substance is not admissible unless the blood test was performed by a
84 person who meets certain qualifications using certain medical standards. (NRS 484C.250,
85 488.500) Section 38 of this bill repeals those provisions relating to the admissibility of blood

Senate Amendment No. 247 to Senate Bill No. 309 Page 5
86 tests. Section 8, 18 and 30 of this bill make conforming changes related to the repeal of those
87 provisions.
88 Existing law creates a parallel scheme whereby certain provisions which prohibit a person
89 from driving or physically controlling a vehicle or operating or physically controlling a vessel
90 under certain circumstances with a concentration of alcohol of 0.10 in his or her blood or
91 breath become effective upon the repeal of certain federal laws which require states to enact
92 and enforce laws which prohibit a person from operating a vehicle with a concentration of
93 alcohol of 0.08 in his or her blood. Sections 32-38 of this bill make various changes to repeal
94 the parallel statutory scheme related to the 0.10 threshold.
95 Existing law generally provides that a fine of not more than $1,000 may be imposed for a
96 misdemeanor or certain offenses treated as misdemeanors. (NRS 193.120, 193.150, 193.160)
97 Sections 24, 26, and 27 of this bill increase the maximum fine to $3,000.
98 Additionally, existing law generally provides that a fine of not more than $2,000 may be
99 imposed for a gross misdemeanor. (NRS 193.140) Section 25 of this bill increases the
100 maximum fine to $4,000.]

31 3. No compensation is payable for the death, disability or treatment of an

Section 4 of chapter 433, Statutes of Nevada 2007, at page 2047:
Sec. 4. NRS 484.385 is hereby amended to read as follows:
484.385 1. As agent for the Department, the officer who obtained
the result of a test given pursuant to NRS 484.382 or 484.383 shall
immediately serve an order of revocation of the license, permit or privilege
to drive on a person who has a concentration of alcohol of 0.10 or more in
his blood or breath or has a detectable amount of a prohibited substance in
his blood or urine, if that person is present, and shall seize his license or
permit to drive. The officer shall then advise him of his right to
administrative and judicial review of the revocation [and to have a]
pursuant to NRS 484.387 and, except as otherwise provided in this
subsection, that he has a right to request a temporary license . [, and] If
the person currently is driving with a temporary license that was issued
pursuant to this section or NRS 484.387, he is not entitled to request an
additional temporary license pursuant to this section or NRS 484.387,
and the order of revocation issued by the officer must revoke the
temporary license that was previously issued. If the person is entitled to
request a temporary license, the officer shall issue him a temporary license
on a form approved by the Department if he requests one, which is effective
for only 7 days including the date of issuance. The officer shall
immediately transmit the person’s license or permit to the Department
along with the written certificate required by subsection 2.
2. When a police officer has served an order of revocation of a
driver’s license, permit or privilege on a person pursuant to subsection 1, or

Senate Amendment No. 247 to Senate Bill No. 309 Page 50
later receives the result of an evidentiary test which indicates that a person,
not then present, had a concentration of alcohol of 0.10 or more in his blood
or breath or had a detectable amount of a prohibited substance in his blood
or urine, the officer shall immediately prepare and transmit to the
Department, together with the seized license or permit and a copy of the
result of the test, a written certificate that he had reasonable grounds to
believe that the person had been driving or in actual physical control of a
vehicle with a concentration of alcohol of 0.10 or more in his blood or
breath or with a detectable amount of a prohibited substance in his blood or
urine, as determined by a chemical test. The certificate must also indicate
whether the officer served an order of revocation on the person and whether
he issued the person a temporary license.
3. The Department, upon receipt of such a certificate for which an
order of revocation has not been served, after examining the certificate and
copy of the result of the chemical test, if any, and finding that revocation is
proper, shall issue an order revoking the person’s license, permit or
privilege to drive by mailing the order to the person at his last known
address. The order must indicate the grounds for the revocation and the
period during which the person is not eligible for a license, permit or
privilege to drive and state that the person has a right to administrative and
judicial review of the revocation and to have a temporary license. The order
of revocation becomes effective 5 days after mailing.
4. Notice of an order of revocation and notice of the affirmation of a
prior order of revocation or the cancellation of a temporary license provided
in NRS 484.387 is sufficient if it is mailed to the person’s last known
address as shown by any application for a license. The date of mailing may
be proved by the certificate of any officer or employee of the Department,
specifying the time of mailing the notice. The notice is presumed to have
been received upon the expiration of 5 days after it is deposited, postage
prepaid, in the United States mail.
Section 6 of chapter 433, Statutes of Nevada 2007, at page 2049:
Sec. 6. NRS 484.387 is hereby amended to read as follows:
484.387 1. At any time while a person is not eligible for a license,
permit or privilege to drive following an order of revocation issued
pursuant to NRS 484.385, he may request in writing a hearing by the
Department to review the order of revocation, but he is only entitled to one
hearing. The hearing must be conducted within 15 days after receipt of the
request, or as soon thereafter as is practicable, in the county where the
requester resides unless the parties agree otherwise. The Director or his
agent may issue subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses and the
production of relevant books and papers and may require a reexamination
of the requester. [The] Unless the person is ineligible for a temporary
license pursuant to NRS 484.385, the Department shall issue an additional
temporary license for a period which is sufficient to complete the
administrative review.
2. The scope of the hearing must be limited to the issue of whether
the person, at the time of the test, had a concentration of alcohol of 0.10 or
more in his blood or breath or a detectable amount of a prohibited substance
in his blood or urine. Upon an affirmative finding on this issue, the
Department shall affirm the order of revocation. Otherwise, the order of
revocation must be rescinded.

Senate Amendment No. 247 to Senate Bill No. 309 Page 51
3. If, after the hearing, the order of revocation is affirmed, the person
whose license, privilege or permit has been revoked is entitled to a review
of the same issues in district court in the same manner as provided by
chapter 233B of NRS. The court shall notify the Department upon the
issuance of a stay, and the Department shall issue an additional temporary
license for a period which is sufficient to complete the review.
4. If a hearing officer grants a continuance of a hearing at the request
of the person whose license was revoked, or a court does so after issuing a
stay of the revocation, the officer or court shall notify the Department, and
the Department shall cancel the temporary license and notify the holder by
mailing the order of cancellation to his last known address.
Section 10.7 of chapter 486, Statutes of Nevada 2007, at page 2789:
Sec. 10.7. NRS 483.461 is hereby amended to read as follows:
483.461 1. If the result of a test given pursuant to NRS 484.382 or
484.383 shows that a person less than 21 years of age had a concentration
of alcohol of 0.02 or more but less than 0.10 in his blood or breath at the
time of the test, his license, permit or privilege to drive must be suspended
for a period of 90 days.
2. If a revocation or suspension of a person’s license, permit or
privilege to drive for a violation of NRS 62E.640, 484.379, 484.3795 or
484.37955 or section 22 of this act follows a suspension ordered pursuant
to subsection 1, the Department shall:
(a) Cancel the suspension ordered pursuant to subsection 1; and
(b) Give the person credit toward the period of revocation or
suspension ordered pursuant to NRS 62E.640, 484.379, 484.3795 or
484.37955 [,] or section 22 of this act, whichever is applicable, for any
period during which the person’s license, permit or privilege to drive was
suspended pursuant to subsection 1.
3. This section does not preclude:
(a) The prosecution of a person for a violation of any other provision
of law; or
(b) The suspension or revocation of a person’s license, permit or
privilege to drive pursuant to any other provision of law.
Section 27.7 of chapter 486, Statutes of Nevada 2007, at page 2800:
Sec. 27.7. NRS 484.37955 is hereby amended to read as follows:
484.37955 1. A person commits vehicular homicide if he:
(a) Drives or is in actual physical control of a vehicle on or off the
highways of this State and:
(1) Is under the influence of intoxicating liquor;
(2) Has a concentration of alcohol of 0.10 or more in his blood or
breath;
(3) Is found by measurement within 2 hours after driving or being
in actual physical control of a vehicle to have a concentration of alcohol of
0.10 or more in his blood or breath;
(4) Is under the influence of a controlled substance or is under the
combined influence of intoxicating liquor and a controlled substance;
(5) Inhales, ingests, applies or otherwise uses any chemical, poison
or organic solvent, or any compound or combination of any of these, to a
degree which renders him incapable of safely driving or exercising actual
physical control of a vehicle; or

Senate Amendment No. 247 to Senate Bill No. 309 Page 52
(6) Has a prohibited substance in his blood or urine in an amount
that is equal to or greater than the amount set forth in subsection 3 of NRS
484.379;
(b) Proximately causes the death of a person other than himself while
driving or in actual physical control of a vehicle on or off the highways of
this State; and
(c) Has previously been convicted of at least three offenses.
2. A person who commits vehicular homicide is guilty of a category

3. A person imprisoned pursuant to subsection 2 must, insofar as
practicable, be segregated from offenders whose crimes were violent and,
insofar as practicable, be assigned to an institution or facility of minimum
security.
4. A prosecuting attorney shall not dismiss a charge of vehicular
homicide in exchange for a plea of guilty, guilty but mentally ill or nolo
contendere to a lesser charge or for any other reason unless he knows or it
is obvious that the charge is not supported by probable cause or cannot be
proved at the time of trial. A sentence imposed pursuant to subsection 2
may not be suspended nor may probation be granted.
5. If consumption is proven by a preponderance of the evidence, it is
an affirmative defense under subparagraph (3) of paragraph (a) of
subsection 1 that the defendant consumed a sufficient quantity of alcohol
after driving or being in actual physical control of the vehicle, and before
his blood or breath was tested, to cause him to have a concentration of
alcohol of 0.10 or more in his blood or breath. A defendant who intends to
offer this defense at a trial or preliminary hearing must, not less than 14
days before the trial or hearing or at such other time as the court may direct,
file and serve on the prosecuting attorney a written notice of that intent.
6. If the defendant was transporting a person who is less than 15 years
of age in the vehicle at the time of the violation, the court shall consider
that fact as an aggravating factor in determining the sentence of the
defendant.
7. As used in this section, “offense” means:

act;
(b) A homicide resulting from driving or being in actual physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or a
controlled substance or resulting from any other conduct prohibited by this
section or NRS 484.379 or 484.3795; or
(c) A violation of a law of any other jurisdiction that prohibits the same
or similar conduct as set forth in paragraph (a) or (b).
Section 46 of chapter 486, Statutes of Nevada 2007, at page 2812:

degree which renders him incapable of safely driving or exercising actual
physical control of a commercial motor vehicle,
 to drive or be in actual physical control of a commercial motor vehicle
on a highway or on premises to which the public has access. The fact that

which the public has access with an amount of a prohibited substance in his
blood or urine that is equal to or greater than:
