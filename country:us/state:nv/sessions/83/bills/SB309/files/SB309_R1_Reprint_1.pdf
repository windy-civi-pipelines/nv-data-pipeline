AN ACT relating to crimes; revising provisions relating to
prohibited acts concerning the use of alcohol, marijuana
and certain other prohibited substances; providing
penalties; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits a person from driving or physically controlling a vehicle
2 or operating or physically controlling a vessel under certain circumstances if the
3 person has specified amounts of certain prohibited substances in his or her blood or
4 urine. (NRS 484C.110, 488.410) Sections 5 and 15 of this bill additionally prohibit
5 a person from driving or physically controlling a vehicle or operating or physically
6 controlling a vessel with specific amounts of fentanyl in his or her blood or urine.
7 Section 3 of this bill makes a conforming change to include fentanyl in the
8 definition of “prohibited substance.”
9 Existing law establishes various penalties applicable to the offense of driving or
10 physically controlling a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a prohibited
11 substance, depending on whether the offense is the first, second or third offense
12 within 7 years. (NRS 484C.400) Among other things, a court may sentence a
13 person who is found guilty of a second offense within 7 years to: (1) imprisonment
14 for not less than 10 days nor more than 6 months in jail; or (2) residential
15 confinement for not less than 10 days nor more than 6 months. Section 12 of this
16 bill increases the minimum term of imprisonment or residential confinement to 20
17 days.
18 Existing law requires an offender who had a concentration of alcohol of 0.18 or
19 more in his or her blood or breath at the time of an offense to be evaluated before
20 sentencing to determine whether the offender has an alcohol or substance use
21 disorder. (NRS 484C.350) Section 11 of this bill reduces the concentration of
22 alcohol threshold to require an offender who had a concentration of alcohol of 0.16
23 or more in his or her blood or breath at the time of the offense to be evaluated for
-

– 2 –
24 an alcohol or substance use disorder. Sections 1, 9 and 12 of this bill make
25 conforming changes to reduce references to the concentration of alcohol from 0.18
26 to 0.16. Section 38 of this bill makes a technical change to repeal a definition that
27 is not used in chapter 484C of NRS.
28 Additionally, existing law, under certain circumstances, authorizes certain first,
29 second and third-time offenders to apply to the court to undergo a program of
30 treatment for an alcohol or other substance use disorder. (NRS 484C.320,
31 484C.330, 484C.340) Existing law prohibits an offender from applying to undergo
32 such a program for third-time offenders if the offender has previously applied to
33 receive such treatment or has previously been convicted of certain offenses. (NRS
34 484C.340) Section 10 of this bill removes the restriction related to previous
35 applications by a third-time offender to undergo such a program and instead
36 prohibits the offender from applying to undergo such a program if the offender has
37 previously been ordered to complete a program of treatment for third-time
38 offenders.
39 For the purposes of determining whether a person that drives or physically
40 controls a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a prohibited substance is
41 a first, second or third-time offender, existing law qualifies an offense as a prior
42 offense if it is: (1) evidenced by a conviction; or (2) conditionally dismissed or the
43 judgment of conviction is set aside or dismissed in connection with successful
44 completion of a diversionary program or specialty court program. (NRS 484C.400)
45 Section 12 additionally provides that an offense qualifies as a prior offense if the
46 person is undergoing a program of treatment for an alcohol or substance use
47 disorder for a first, second or third-time offender.
48 Existing law establishes a penalty that is applicable to a person who has
49 previously committed certain felonies related to driving under the influence of
50 alcohol or a prohibited substance and who subsequently commits the offense of
51 driving or physically controlling a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a
52 prohibited substance. (NRS 484C.410) Section 13 of this bill additionally applies
53 this penalty to a person who is undergoing a program of treatment for an alcohol or
54 substance use disorder for a third-time offender, if the person subsequently
55 commits the offense of driving or physically controlling a vehicle while under the
56 influence of alcohol or a prohibited substance.

30 or on premises to which the public has access. The fact that any
