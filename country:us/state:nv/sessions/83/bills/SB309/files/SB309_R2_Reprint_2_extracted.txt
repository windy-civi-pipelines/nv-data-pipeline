~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to crimes; revising provisions relating to driving
under the influence of alcohol or certain other prohibited
substances; providing penalties; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes various penalties applicable to the offense of driving or
2 physically controlling a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a prohibited
3 substance, depending on whether the offense is the first, second or third offense
4 within 7 years. (NRS 484C.400) Among other things, a court may sentence a
5 person who is found guilty of a second offense within 7 years to: (1) imprisonment
6 for not less than 10 days nor more than 6 months in jail; or (2) residential
7 confinement for not less than 10 days nor more than 6 months. Section 12 of this
8 bill increases the minimum term of imprisonment or residential confinement to 20
9 days.
10 Existing law requires an offender who had a concentration of alcohol of 0.18 or
11 more in his or her blood or breath at the time of an offense to be evaluated before
12 sentencing to determine whether the offender has an alcohol or substance use
13 disorder. (NRS 484C.350) Section 11 of this bill reduces the concentration of
14 alcohol threshold to require an offender who had a concentration of alcohol of 0.16
15 or more in his or her blood or breath at the time of the offense to be evaluated for
16 an alcohol or substance use disorder. Sections 1, 9 and 12 of this bill make
17 conforming changes to reduce references to the concentration of alcohol from 0.18
18 to 0.16. Section 38 of this bill makes a technical change to repeal a definition that
19 is not used in chapter 484C of NRS.
20 Additionally, existing law, under certain circumstances, authorizes certain first,
21 second and third-time offenders to apply to the court to undergo a program of
22 treatment for an alcohol or other substance use disorder. (NRS 484C.320,
23 484C.330, 484C.340) Existing law prohibits an offender from applying to undergo
24 such a program for third-time offenders if the offender has previously applied to
-
*SB309_R2*
– 2 –
25 receive such treatment or has previously been convicted of certain offenses. (NRS
26 484C.340) Section 10 of this bill removes the restriction related to previous
27 applications by a third-time offender to undergo such a program and instead
28 prohibits the offender from applying to undergo such a program if the offender has
29 previously been ordered to complete a program of treatment for third-time
30 offenders.
31 For the purposes of determining whether a person that drives or physically
32 controls a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a prohibited substance is
33 a first, second or third-time offender, existing law qualifies an offense as a prior
34 offense if it is: (1) evidenced by a conviction; or (2) conditionally dismissed or the
35 judgment of conviction is set aside or dismissed in connection with successful
36 completion of a diversionary program or specialty court program. (NRS 484C.400)
37 Section 12 additionally provides that an offense qualifies as a prior offense if the
38 person is undergoing a program of treatment for an alcohol or substance use
39 disorder for a first, second or third-time offender.
40 Existing law establishes a penalty that is applicable to a person who has
41 previously committed certain felonies related to driving under the influence of
42 alcohol or a prohibited substance and who subsequently commits the offense of
43 driving or physically controlling a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a
44 prohibited substance. (NRS 484C.410) Section 13 of this bill additionally applies
45 this penalty to a person who is undergoing a program of treatment for an alcohol or
46 substance use disorder for a third-time offender, if the person subsequently
47 commits the offense of driving or physically controlling a vehicle while under the
48 influence of alcohol or a prohibited substance.

(Reprinted with amendments adopted on May 29, 2025)
SECOND REPRINT S.B. 309
SENATE BILL NO. 309–SENATOR STEINBECK
MARCH 10, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Growth and Infrastructure
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to crimes. (BDR 43-906)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: Increases or Newly
Provides for Term of Imprisonment in County or City
Jail or Detention Facility.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to crimes; revising provisions relating to driving
under the influence of alcohol or certain other prohibited
substances; providing penalties; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes various penalties applicable to the offense of driving or
2 physically controlling a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a prohibited
3 substance, depending on whether the offense is the first, second or third offense
4 within 7 years. (NRS 484C.400) Among other things, a court may sentence a
5 person who is found guilty of a second offense within 7 years to: (1) imprisonment
6 for not less than 10 days nor more than 6 months in jail; or (2) residential
7 confinement for not less than 10 days nor more than 6 months. Section 12 of this
8 bill increases the minimum term of imprisonment or residential confinement to 20
9 days.
10 Existing law requires an offender who had a concentration of alcohol of 0.18 or
11 more in his or her blood or breath at the time of an offense to be evaluated before
12 sentencing to determine whether the offender has an alcohol or substance use
13 disorder. (NRS 484C.350) Section 11 of this bill reduces the concentration of
14 alcohol threshold to require an offender who had a concentration of alcohol of 0.16
15 or more in his or her blood or breath at the time of the offense to be evaluated for
16 an alcohol or substance use disorder. Sections 1, 9 and 12 of this bill make
17 conforming changes to reduce references to the concentration of alcohol from 0.18
18 to 0.16. Section 38 of this bill makes a technical change to repeal a definition that
19 is not used in chapter 484C of NRS.
20 Additionally, existing law, under certain circumstances, authorizes certain first,
21 second and third-time offenders to apply to the court to undergo a program of
22 treatment for an alcohol or other substance use disorder. (NRS 484C.320,
23 484C.330, 484C.340) Existing law prohibits an offender from applying to undergo
24 such a program for third-time offenders if the offender has previously applied to
-
*SB309_R2*

– 2 –
25 receive such treatment or has previously been convicted of certain offenses. (NRS
26 484C.340) Section 10 of this bill removes the restriction related to previous
27 applications by a third-time offender to undergo such a program and instead
28 prohibits the offender from applying to undergo such a program if the offender has
29 previously been ordered to complete a program of treatment for third-time
30 offenders.
31 For the purposes of determining whether a person that drives or physically
32 controls a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a prohibited substance is
33 a first, second or third-time offender, existing law qualifies an offense as a prior
34 offense if it is: (1) evidenced by a conviction; or (2) conditionally dismissed or the
35 judgment of conviction is set aside or dismissed in connection with successful
36 completion of a diversionary program or specialty court program. (NRS 484C.400)
37 Section 12 additionally provides that an offense qualifies as a prior offense if the
38 person is undergoing a program of treatment for an alcohol or substance use
39 disorder for a first, second or third-time offender.
40 Existing law establishes a penalty that is applicable to a person who has
41 previously committed certain felonies related to driving under the influence of
42 alcohol or a prohibited substance and who subsequently commits the offense of
43 driving or physically controlling a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a
44 prohibited substance. (NRS 484C.410) Section 13 of this bill additionally applies
45 this penalty to a person who is undergoing a program of treatment for an alcohol or
46 substance use disorder for a third-time offender, if the person subsequently
47 commits the offense of driving or physically controlling a vehicle while under the
48 influence of alcohol or a prohibited substance.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 484C.030 is hereby amended to read as

38 comply with any other condition ordered by the court. If the court
39 has a specialty court program for the supervision and monitoring of
40 the person, the treatment provider must comply with the
41 requirements of the specialty court, including, without limitation,
42 any requirement to submit progress reports to the specialty court.

9 offender’s sentence will be reduced to a term of imprisonment
10 which is not less than 1 day and a fine of not more than the

13 offender for the period prescribed by law.
14 5. The court shall administer the program of treatment pursuant
15 to the procedures provided in NRS 176A.230 to 176A.245,
