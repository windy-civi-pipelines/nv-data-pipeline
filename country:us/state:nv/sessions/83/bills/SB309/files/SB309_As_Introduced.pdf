Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits a person from driving or physically controlling a vehicle or
2 operating or physically controlling a vessel under certain circumstances if the person
3 has specified amounts of certain prohibited substances in his or her blood or urine.
4 (NRS 484C.110, 488.410) Sections 5 and 15 of this bill additionally prohibit a person
5 from driving or physically controlling a vehicle or operating or physically controlling
6 a vessel with specific amounts of fentanyl or methylenedioxymethamphetamine in his
7 or her blood or urine. Section 3 of this bill makes a conforming change to include
8 fentanyl and methylenedioxymethamphetamine in the definition of “prohibited
9 substance.”
10 Existing law also prohibits a person from driving or physically controlling a
11 vehicle or operating or physically controlling a vessel under certain circumstances
12 if the person has specific amounts of marijuana or marijuana metabolite in his or
13 her blood and the offense is punishable as a felony. (NRS 484C.110, 484C.400,
14 488.410, 488.427) Sections 5 and 15 expand the applicability of the prohibition
15 concerning the specific amounts of marijuana and marijuana metabolite, thereby
16 making the prohibition also applicable to offenses punishable as a misdemeanor.
17 Additionally, existing law prohibits a person from driving or physically
18 controlling a vehicle or operating or physically controlling a vessel under certain
19 circumstances if the person is found by a measurement within 2 hours after driving
20 or physically controlling the vehicle or operating or physically controlling the
21 vessel to have a concentration of alcohol of 0.08 or more on his or her breath, or
-

– 2 –
22 0.04 or more but less than 0.08 for commercial motor vehicles. (NRS 484C.110,
23 484C.120, 484C.130, 484C.430, 488.410, 488.420, 488.425) Sections 5-7 and 14-
24 17 of this bill make various changes to account for the circumstance under which a
25 person drives or physically controls a vehicle or operates or physically controls a
26 vessel under certain circumstances and is found, after being involved in a crash or
27 collision, as applicable, to have the specified concentration of alcohol on his or her
28 breath. Sections 19-23, 28, 29 and 31 of this bill make conforming changes to
29 account for certain organizational changes made in section 5. Section 4 of this bill
30 makes certain changes concerning when a person is presumed to be in physical
31 control of a vehicle involved in a crash.
32 Existing law establishes various penalties applicable to the offense of driving or
33 physically controlling a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a prohibited
34 substance, depending on whether the offense is the first, second or third offense
35 within 7 years. (NRS 484C.400) Section 12 of this bill makes various changes to
36 increase certain penalties and other sanctions applicable to a first or second offense.
37 Existing law requires an offender who had a concentration of alcohol of 0.18 or
38 more in his or her blood or breath at the time of an offense to be evaluated before
39 sentencing to determine whether the offender has an alcohol or substance use
40 disorder. (NRS 484C.350) Section 11 of this bill reduces the concentration of
41 alcohol threshold to require an offender who had a concentration of alcohol of 0.16
42 or more in his or her blood or breath at the time of the offense to be evaluated for
43 an alcohol or substance use disorder. Sections 1, 2 and 9 of this bill make
44 conforming changes to reduce references to the concentration of alcohol from 0.18
45 to 0.16.
46 Additionally, existing law, under certain circumstances, authorizes certain first,
47 second and third-time offenders to apply to the court to undergo a program of
48 treatment for an alcohol or other substance use disorder. (NRS 484C.320,
49 484C.330, 484C.340) Existing law prohibits an offender from applying to undergo
50 such a program for third-time offenders if the offender has previously applied to
51 receive such treatment or has previously been convicted of certain offenses. (NRS
52 484C.340) Section 10 of this bill removes the restriction related to previous
53 applications by a third-time offender to undergo such a program and instead
54 prohibits the offender from applying to undergo such a program if the offender has
55 previously been ordered to complete a program of treatment for third-time
56 offenders.
57 For the purposes of determining whether a person that drives or physically
58 controls a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a prohibited substance is
59 a first, second or third-time offender, existing law qualifies an offense as a prior
60 offense if it is: (1) evidenced by a conviction; or (2) conditionally dismissed or the
61 judgment of conviction is set aside or dismissed in connection with successful
62 completion of a diversionary program or specialty court program. (NRS 484C.400)
63 Section 12 of this bill additionally provides that an offense qualifies as a prior
64 offense if the person is undergoing a program of treatment for an alcohol or
65 substance use disorder for a first, second or third-time offender.
66 Existing law establishes a penalty that is applicable to a person who has
67 previously committed certain felonies related to driving under the influence of
68 alcohol or a prohibited substance and who subsequently commits the offense of
69 driving or physically controlling a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a
70 prohibited substance. (NRS 484C.410) Section 13 of this bill additionally applies
71 this penalty to a person who is undergoing a program of treatment for an alcohol or
72 substance use disorder for a third-time offender, if the person subsequently
73 commits the offense of driving or physically controlling a vehicle while under the
74 influence of alcohol or a prohibited substance.
75 Existing law requires certain conduct related to driving under the influence of
76 alcohol or a prohibited substance to have taken place “on a highway or on premises
-
*SB309*

– 3 –
77 to which the public has access.” (NRS 484C.110, 484C.120, 484C.150, 484C.160)
78 Existing law also requires certain other conduct related to driving under the
79 influence of alcohol or a prohibited substance to have taken place “on or off the
80 highways of this State.” (NRS 484C.130, 484C.430) Sections 7 and 14 of this bill
81 replace the phrase “on or off the highways of this State” with “on a highway or
82 premises to which the public has access” for consistency throughout provisions
83 governing driving under the influence of alcohol or a prohibited substance.
84 Existing law provides that a blood test related to a person accused of driving or
85 physically controlling a vehicle or operating or physically controlling a vessel while
86 under the influence of alcohol or a prohibited substance is not admissible unless the
87 blood test was performed by a person who meets certain qualifications using certain
88 medical standards. (NRS 484C.250, 488.500) Section 38 of this bill repeals those
89 provisions relating to the admissibility of blood tests. Section 8, 18 and 30 of this
90 bill make conforming changes related to the repeal of those provisions.
91 Existing law creates a parallel scheme whereby certain provisions which
92 prohibit a person from driving or physically controlling a vehicle or operating or
93 physically controlling a vessel under certain circumstances with a concentration of
94 alcohol of 0.10 in his or her blood or breath become effective upon the repeal of
95 certain federal laws which require states to enact and enforce laws which prohibit a
96 person from operating a vehicle with a concentration of alcohol of 0.08 in his or her
97 blood. Sections 32-38 of this bill make various changes to repeal the parallel
98 statutory scheme related to the 0.10 threshold.
99 Existing law generally provides that a fine of not more than $1,000 may be
100 imposed for a misdemeanor or certain offenses treated as misdemeanors. (NRS
101 193.120, 193.150, 193.160) Sections 24, 26, and 27 of this bill increase the
102 maximum fine to $3,000.
103 Additionally, existing law generally provides that a fine of not more than
104 $2,000 may be imposed for a gross misdemeanor. (NRS 193.140) Section 25 of
105 this bill increases the maximum fine to $4,000.

breath was tested, to cause him to have a concentration of
alcohol of 0.10 or more in his blood or breath. A defendant
who intends to offer this defense at a trial or preliminary
hearing must, not less than 14 days before the trial or hearing
or at such other time as the court may direct, file and serve on
the prosecuting attorney a written notice of that intent.
6. If the defendant was transporting a person who is less
than 15 years of age in the vessel at the time of the violation,

-
*SB309*

– 65 –
(c) A violation of a law of any other jurisdiction that
prohibits the same or similar conduct as set forth in paragraph

Section 4 of chapter 433, Statutes of Nevada 2007, at page
2047:
Sec. 4. NRS 484.385 is hereby amended to read as
follows:
484.385 1. As agent for the Department, the officer
who obtained the result of a test given pursuant to NRS
484.382 or 484.383 shall immediately serve an order of
revocation of the license, permit or privilege to drive on a
person who has a concentration of alcohol of 0.10 or more in
his blood or breath or has a detectable amount of a prohibited
substance in his blood or urine, if that person is present, and
shall seize his license or permit to drive. The officer shall
then advise him of his right to administrative and judicial
review of the revocation [and to have a] pursuant to NRS
484.387 and, except as otherwise provided in this
subsection, that he has a right to request a temporary license
. [, and] If the person currently is driving with a temporary
license that was issued pursuant to this section or NRS
484.387, he is not entitled to request an additional
temporary license pursuant to this section or NRS 484.387,
and the order of revocation issued by the officer must
revoke the temporary license that was previously issued. If
the person is entitled to request a temporary license, the
officer shall issue him a temporary license on a form
approved by the Department if he requests one, which is
effective for only 7 days including the date of issuance. The
officer shall immediately transmit the person’s license or
permit to the Department along with the written certificate
required by subsection 2.
2. When a police officer has served an order of
revocation of a driver’s license, permit or privilege on a
person pursuant to subsection 1, or later receives the result of
an evidentiary test which indicates that a person, not then
present, had a concentration of alcohol of 0.10 or more in his
blood or breath or had a detectable amount of a prohibited
substance in his blood or urine, the officer shall immediately
prepare and transmit to the Department, together with the
seized license or permit and a copy of the result of the test, a
written certificate that he had reasonable grounds to believe
that the person had been driving or in actual physical control
of a vehicle with a concentration of alcohol of 0.10 or more in
-
*SB309*

– 66 –
his blood or breath or with a detectable amount of a
prohibited substance in his blood or urine, as determined by a
chemical test. The certificate must also indicate whether the
officer served an order of revocation on the person and
whether he issued the person a temporary license.
3. The Department, upon receipt of such a certificate for
which an order of revocation has not been served, after
examining the certificate and copy of the result of the
chemical test, if any, and finding that revocation is proper,
shall issue an order revoking the person’s license, permit or
privilege to drive by mailing the order to the person at his last
known address. The order must indicate the grounds for the
revocation and the period during which the person is not
eligible for a license, permit or privilege to drive and state
that the person has a right to administrative and judicial
review of the revocation and to have a temporary license. The
order of revocation becomes effective 5 days after mailing.
4. Notice of an order of revocation and notice of the
affirmation of a prior order of revocation or the cancellation
of a temporary license provided in NRS 484.387 is sufficient
if it is mailed to the person’s last known address as shown by
any application for a license. The date of mailing may be
proved by the certificate of any officer or employee of the
Department, specifying the time of mailing the notice. The
notice is presumed to have been received upon the expiration
of 5 days after it is deposited, postage prepaid, in the United
States mail.
Section 6 of chapter 433, Statutes of Nevada 2007, at page
2049:
Sec. 6. NRS 484.387 is hereby amended to read as
follows:
484.387 1. At any time while a person is not eligible
for a license, permit or privilege to drive following an order
of revocation issued pursuant to NRS 484.385, he may
request in writing a hearing by the Department to review the
order of revocation, but he is only entitled to one hearing. The
hearing must be conducted within 15 days after receipt of the
request, or as soon thereafter as is practicable, in the county
where the requester resides unless the parties agree otherwise.
The Director or his agent may issue subpoenas for the
attendance of witnesses and the production of relevant books
and papers and may require a reexamination of the requester.
[The] Unless the person is ineligible for a temporary license
pursuant to NRS 484.385, the Department shall issue an
-
*SB309*

– 67 –
additional temporary license for a period which is sufficient
to complete the administrative review.
2. The scope of the hearing must be limited to the issue
of whether the person, at the time of the test, had a
concentration of alcohol of 0.10 or more in his blood or
breath or a detectable amount of a prohibited substance in his
blood or urine. Upon an affirmative finding on this issue, the
Department shall affirm the order of revocation. Otherwise,
the order of revocation must be rescinded.
3. If, after the hearing, the order of revocation is
affirmed, the person whose license, privilege or permit has
been revoked is entitled to a review of the same issues in
district court in the same manner as provided by chapter 233B
of NRS. The court shall notify the Department upon the
issuance of a stay, and the Department shall issue an
additional temporary license for a period which is sufficient
to complete the review.
4. If a hearing officer grants a continuance of a hearing
at the request of the person whose license was revoked, or a
court does so after issuing a stay of the revocation, the officer
or court shall notify the Department, and the Department shall
cancel the temporary license and notify the holder by mailing
the order of cancellation to his last known address.
Section 10.7 of chapter 486, Statutes of Nevada 2007, at page
2789:
Sec. 10.7. NRS 483.461 is hereby amended to read as
follows:

age had a concentration of alcohol of 0.02 or more but less
than 0.10 in his blood or breath at the time of the test, his
license, permit or privilege to drive must be suspended for a
period of 90 days.
2. If a revocation or suspension of a person’s license,
permit or privilege to drive for a violation of NRS 62E.640,
484.379, 484.3795 or 484.37955 or section 22 of this act
follows a suspension ordered pursuant to subsection 1, the
Department shall:
