EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to contractors; revising certain bond requirements
for certain licensed contractors and certain applicants for
a contractor’s license; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, an applicant for a contractor’s license and a licensed
2 contractor are required to obtain certain bonds in certain circumstances. Existing
3 law requires such bonds to be provided by a person whose long-term debt
4 obligations are rated “A” or better by a nationally recognized rating agency. (NRS
5 624.270, 624.276) Sections 1 and 2 of this bill revise this requirement to require
6 that such bonds must be provided by a person who is identified in certain
7 publications issued by the United States Department of the Treasury as holding
8 certain certificates.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 624.270 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 624.270 1. Before issuing a contractor’s license to any
3 applicant, the Board shall require that the applicant:
4 (a) File with the Board a surety bond in a form acceptable to the
5 Board executed by the contractor as principal with a corporation
6 authorized to transact surety business in the State of Nevada as
7 surety; or
8 (b) In lieu of such a bond, establish with the Board a cash
9 deposit as provided in this section.

1 2. Before granting renewal of a contractor’s license to any
2 applicant, the Board shall require that the applicant file with the
3 Board satisfactory evidence that the applicant’s surety bond or cash
4 deposit is in full force, unless the applicant has been relieved of the
5 requirement as provided in this section.
6 3. Failure of an applicant or licensee to file or maintain in full
7 force the required bond or to establish the required cash deposit
8 constitutes cause for the Board to deny, revoke, suspend or refuse to
9 renew a license.
10 4. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 6, the amount of
11 each bond or cash deposit required by this section must be fixed by
12 the Board with reference to the contractor’s financial and
13 professional responsibility and the magnitude of the contractor’s
14 operations, but must be not less than $1,000 or more than $500,000.
15 The bond must be continuous in form and must be conditioned that
16 the total aggregate liability of the surety for all claims is limited to
17 the face amount of the bond irrespective of the number of years the
18 bond is in force. A bond required by this section must be provided
19 by a person [whose long-term debt obligations are rated “A” or
20 better by a nationally recognized rating agency.] who is, at the time
21 of the execution of the bond, listed as a certificate holding
22 company in the United States Department of the Treasury
23 Circular No. 570 published pursuant to 31 C.F.R. § 223.16. The
24 Board may increase or reduce the amount of any bond or cash
25 deposit if evidence supporting such a change in the amount is
26 presented to the Board at the time application is made for renewal of
27 a license or at any hearing conducted pursuant to NRS 624.2545 or
28 624.291. Unless released earlier pursuant to subsection 5, any cash
29 deposit may be withdrawn 2 years after termination of the license in
30 connection with which it was established, or 2 years after
31 completion of all work authorized by the Board after termination of
32 the license, whichever occurs later, if there is no outstanding claim
33 against it.
34 5. After a licensee has acted in the capacity of a licensed
35 contractor in the State of Nevada for not less than 5 consecutive
36 years, the Board may relieve the licensee of the requirement of
37 filing a bond or establishing a cash deposit if evidence supporting
38 such relief is presented to the Board. The Board may at any time
39 thereafter require the licensee to file a new bond or establish a new
40 cash deposit as provided in subsection 4:
41 (a) If evidence is presented to the Board supporting this
42 requirement;
43 (b) Pursuant to subsection 6, after notification of a final written
44 decision by the Labor Commissioner; or
