Senate Bill No. 327–Senator Cruz-Crawford
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to contractors; revising certain bond requirements
for certain licensed contractors and certain applicants for a
contractor’s license; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Under existing law, an applicant for a contractor’s license and a licensed
contractor are required to obtain certain bonds in certain circumstances. Existing
law requires such bonds to be provided by a person whose long-term debt
obligations are rated “A” or better by a nationally recognized rating agency. (NRS
624.270, 624.276) Sections 1 and 2 of this bill revise this requirement to require
that such bonds must be provided by a person who is identified in certain
publications issued by the United States Department of the Treasury as holding
certain certificates.
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
Section 1. NRS 624.270 is hereby amended to read as follows:
624.270 1. Before issuing a contractor’s license to any
applicant, the Board shall require that the applicant:
(a) File with the Board a surety bond in a form acceptable to the
Board executed by the contractor as principal with a corporation
authorized to transact surety business in the State of Nevada as
surety; or
(b) In lieu of such a bond, establish with the Board a cash
deposit as provided in this section.
2. Before granting renewal of a contractor’s license to any
applicant, the Board shall require that the applicant file with the
Board satisfactory evidence that the applicant’s surety bond or cash
deposit is in full force, unless the applicant has been relieved of the
requirement as provided in this section.
3. Failure of an applicant or licensee to file or maintain in full
force the required bond or to establish the required cash deposit
constitutes cause for the Board to deny, revoke, suspend or refuse to
renew a license.
4. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 6, the amount of
each bond or cash deposit required by this section must be fixed by
the Board with reference to the contractor’s financial and
professional responsibility and the magnitude of the contractor’s
operations, but must be not less than $1,000 or more than $500,000.

The bond must be continuous in form and must be conditioned that
the total aggregate liability of the surety for all claims is limited to
the face amount of the bond irrespective of the number of years the
bond is in force. A bond required by this section must be provided
by a person [whose long-term debt obligations are rated “A” or
better by a nationally recognized rating agency.] who is, at the time

Board may increase or reduce the amount of any bond or cash
deposit if evidence supporting such a change in the amount is
presented to the Board at the time application is made for renewal of
a license or at any hearing conducted pursuant to NRS 624.2545 or
624.291. Unless released earlier pursuant to subsection 5, any cash
deposit may be withdrawn 2 years after termination of the license in
connection with which it was established, or 2 years after
completion of all work authorized by the Board after termination of
the license, whichever occurs later, if there is no outstanding claim
against it.
5. After a licensee has acted in the capacity of a licensed
contractor in the State of Nevada for not less than 5 consecutive
years, the Board may relieve the licensee of the requirement of
filing a bond or establishing a cash deposit if evidence supporting
such relief is presented to the Board. The Board may at any time
thereafter require the licensee to file a new bond or establish a new
cash deposit as provided in subsection 4:
(a) If evidence is presented to the Board supporting this
requirement;
(b) Pursuant to subsection 6, after notification of a final written
decision by the Labor Commissioner; or
(c) Pursuant to subsection 7.
 If a licensee is relieved of the requirement of establishing a cash
deposit, the deposit may be withdrawn 2 years after such relief is
granted, if there is no outstanding claim against it.
6. If the Board is notified by the Labor Commissioner pursuant
to NRS 607.165 or otherwise receives notification that three
substantiated claims for wages have been filed against a contractor
within a 2-year period, the Board shall require the contractor to file
a bond or establish a cash deposit in an amount fixed by the Board.
The contractor shall maintain the bond or cash deposit for the period
required by the Board.
