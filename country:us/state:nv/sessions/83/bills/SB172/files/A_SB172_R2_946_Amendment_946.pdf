AN ACT relating to employment; enacting the Agricultural Workers’ Bill of
Rights; [revising] clarifying provisions relating to the provision of
periods for rest and meals; establishing certain rights of agricultural
workers related to housing and access to certain service providers;
prohibiting certain actions related to weeding and thinning; requiring
the provision of certain protections to agricultural workers during
certain emergencies and disasters; authorizing collective bargaining for
agricultural workers; authorizing the commencement of a civil action
in certain circumstances; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prescribes periods for rest and meals for employees during work hours.
2 (NRS 608.019) Section 2 of this bill [provides] clarifies that [an employer may not employ]
3 these periods for rest and meals apply to an agricultural employee . [for a continuous period
4 of 5 hours without authorizing the agricultural employee to have a meal period of at least one-
5 half hour.]
6 Existing law authorizes wages and compensation to include lodging and meals under
7 certain circumstances and prohibits the lodging and meals from being valued more than
8 certain amounts for purposes of computing the wages and compensation. Existing law,
9 however, exempts agricultural employees from these prohibitions on the computable value of
10 the lodging and meals. (NRS 608.154, 608.155) Sections 3 and 4 of this bill remove these
11 exemptions for agricultural employees, thereby providing that the prohibitions on the
12 computable value of lodging and meals apply to agricultural employees.
13 Section 1.3 of this bill defines the term “agricultural employee” for the purposes of this
14 bill. Sections 1.7, 4.3 and 4.7 of this bill make conforming changes related to the applicability
15 of the definition contained in section 1.3.
16 Existing law also prohibits various employment practices. (Chapter 613 of NRS) Sections
17 6-20 of this bill establish the Agricultural Workers’ Bill of Rights. Section 9 defines
18 “agricultural worker” as a worker engaged in certain agriculture or farming services or
19 activities described in section 203(f) of the federal Fair Labor Standards Act.
20 Section 11 entitles an agricultural worker who lives in housing provided by an
21 agricultural employer to reasonable access for visitors. [Sections] Section 12 [and 13 entitle]
22 entitles an agricultural worker to reasonable access to key service providers at certain times
23 during working hours . [and afford the agricultural worker the right to be transported to key
24 service providers under certain circumstances.]

Assembly Amendment No. 946 to Senate Bill No. 172 Second Reprint Page 4
25 Section 14 prohibits persons from taking certain actions that restrict the ability of an
26 agricultural worker to enter or leave the residence of the agricultural worker.
27 Additionally, section 15, with certain exceptions, prohibits certain conduct related to
28 weeding or thinning by hand or using a short-handed hoe in a stooped, kneeling or squatting
29 position.
30 Section 16 requires agricultural employers to post certain notices related to the provisions
31 established in sections 11-15.
32 Section 17 requires agricultural employers, during periods of emergency or disaster, to:
33 (1) meet certain requirements related to housing provided to agricultural workers; and (2)
34 supply certain information to the agricultural workers.
35 Section 19 authorizes agricultural workers to organize and form collective bargaining
36 units.
37 Section 20 establishes a civil remedy for certain persons who are aggrieved by violations
38 of the Agricultural Workers’ Bill of Rights.
