AN ACT relating to employment; enacting the Agricultural
Workers’ Bill of Rights; clarifying provisions relating to
the provision of periods for rest and meals; establishing
certain rights of agricultural workers related to housing
and access to certain service providers; prohibiting certain
actions related to weeding and thinning; requiring the

circumstances; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prescribes periods for rest and meals for employees during work
2 hours. (NRS 608.019) Section 2 of this bill clarifies that these periods for rest and
3 meals apply to an agricultural employee.
4 Existing law authorizes wages and compensation to include lodging and meals
5 under certain circumstances and prohibits the lodging and meals from being valued
6 more than certain amounts for purposes of computing the wages and compensation.
7 Existing law, however, exempts agricultural employees from these prohibitions on
8 the computable value of the lodging and meals. (NRS 608.154, 608.155) Sections 3
9 and 4 of this bill remove these exemptions for agricultural employees, thereby
10 providing that the prohibitions on the computable value of lodging and meals apply
11 to agricultural employees.
12 Section 1.3 of this bill defines the term “agricultural employee” for the
13 purposes of this bill. Sections 1.7, 4.3 and 4.7 of this bill make conforming
14 changes related to the applicability of the definition contained in section 1.3.
15 Existing law also prohibits various employment practices. (Chapter 613 of
16 NRS) Sections 6-20 of this bill establish the Agricultural Workers’ Bill of Rights.

21 agricultural employer to reasonable access for visitors. Section 12 entitles an
22 agricultural worker to reasonable access to key service providers at certain times
23 during working hours.

25 of an agricultural worker to enter or leave the residence of the agricultural worker.
26 Additionally, section 15, with certain exceptions, prohibits certain conduct
27 related to weeding or thinning by hand or using a short-handed hoe in a stooped,
28 kneeling or squatting position.

33 agricultural workers; and (2) supply certain information to the agricultural workers.
