EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to employment; enacting the Agricultural
Workers’ Bill of Rights; revising provisions relating to
the provision of periods for rest and meals; establishing
certain rights of agricultural workers related to housing
and access to certain service providers; prohibiting certain
actions related to weeding and thinning; requiring the
provision of certain protections to agricultural workers
during certain emergencies and disasters; authorizing
collective bargaining for agricultural workers; authorizing
the commencement of a civil action in certain
circumstances; creating the Advisory Committee on
Agricultural Work; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prescribes periods for rest and meals for employees during work
2 hours. (NRS 608.019) Section 2 of this bill provides that an employer may not
3 employ an agricultural employee for a continuous period of 5 hours without
4 authorizing the agricultural employee to have a meal period of at least one-half
5 hour.
6 Existing law authorizes wages and compensation to include lodging and meals
7 under certain circumstances and prohibits the lodging and meals from being valued
8 more than certain amounts for purposes of computing the wages and compensation.
9 Existing law, however, exempts agricultural employees from these prohibitions on
10 the computable value of the lodging and meals. (NRS 608.154, 608.155) Sections 3
11 and 4 of this bill remove these exemptions for agricultural employees, thereby
12 providing that the prohibitions on the computable value of lodging and meals apply
13 to agricultural employees.

19 Section 9 defines “agricultural worker” as a worker engaged in certain agriculture
20 or farming services or activities described in section 203(f) of the federal Fair
21 Labor Standards Act.
22 Section 11 entitles an agricultural worker who lives in housing provided by an
23 agricultural employer to reasonable access for visitors. Sections 12 and 13 entitle
24 an agricultural worker to reasonable access to key service providers at certain times
25 during working hours and afford the agricultural worker the right to be transported
26 to key service providers under certain circumstances.
27 Section 14 prohibits persons from taking certain actions that restrict the ability
28 of an agricultural worker to enter or leave the residence of the agricultural worker.
29 Additionally, section 15, with certain exceptions, prohibits certain conduct
30 related to weeding or thinning by hand or using a short-handed hoe in a stooped,
31 kneeling or squatting position.
32 Section 16 requires agricultural employers to post certain notices related to the
33 provisions established in sections 11-15.

PREFILED FEBRUARY 3, 2025

SUMMARY—Prescribes certain rights for agricultural workers.
(BDR 53-959)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to employment; enacting the Agricultural
Workers’ Bill of Rights; revising provisions relating to
the provision of periods for rest and meals; establishing
certain rights of agricultural workers related to housing
and access to certain service providers; prohibiting certain
actions related to weeding and thinning; requiring the
provision of certain protections to agricultural workers
during certain emergencies and disasters; authorizing
collective bargaining for agricultural workers; authorizing
the commencement of a civil action in certain
circumstances; creating the Advisory Committee on
Agricultural Work; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prescribes periods for rest and meals for employees during work
2 hours. (NRS 608.019) Section 2 of this bill provides that an employer may not
3 employ an agricultural employee for a continuous period of 5 hours without
4 authorizing the agricultural employee to have a meal period of at least one-half
5 hour.
6 Existing law authorizes wages and compensation to include lodging and meals
7 under certain circumstances and prohibits the lodging and meals from being valued
8 more than certain amounts for purposes of computing the wages and compensation.
9 Existing law, however, exempts agricultural employees from these prohibitions on
10 the computable value of the lodging and meals. (NRS 608.154, 608.155) Sections 3
11 and 4 of this bill remove these exemptions for agricultural employees, thereby
12 providing that the prohibitions on the computable value of lodging and meals apply
13 to agricultural employees.

14 Section 1.3 of this bill defines the term “agricultural employee” for the
15 purposes of this bill. Sections 1.7, 4.3 and 4.7 of this bill make conforming
16 changes related to the applicability of the definition contained in section 1.3.
17 Existing law also prohibits various employment practices. (Chapter 613 of
18 NRS) Sections 6-21 of this bill establish the Agricultural Workers’ Bill of Rights.
19 Section 9 defines “agricultural worker” as a worker engaged in certain agriculture
20 or farming services or activities described in section 203(f) of the federal Fair
21 Labor Standards Act.
22 Section 11 entitles an agricultural worker who lives in housing provided by an
23 agricultural employer to reasonable access for visitors. Sections 12 and 13 entitle
24 an agricultural worker to reasonable access to key service providers at certain times
25 during working hours and afford the agricultural worker the right to be transported
26 to key service providers under certain circumstances.
27 Section 14 prohibits persons from taking certain actions that restrict the ability
28 of an agricultural worker to enter or leave the residence of the agricultural worker.
29 Additionally, section 15, with certain exceptions, prohibits certain conduct
30 related to weeding or thinning by hand or using a short-handed hoe in a stooped,
31 kneeling or squatting position.
32 Section 16 requires agricultural employers to post certain notices related to the
33 provisions established in sections 11-15.
34 Section 17 requires agricultural employers, during periods of emergency or
35 disaster, to: (1) meet certain requirements related to housing provided to
36 agricultural workers; and (2) supply certain information to the agricultural workers.
37 Section 19 authorizes agricultural workers to organize and form collective
38 bargaining units.
39 Section 20 establishes a civil remedy for certain persons who are aggrieved by
40 violations of the Agricultural Workers’ Bill of Rights.
41 Section 21 creates the Advisory Committee on Agricultural Work and
42 prescribes its membership and duties.
