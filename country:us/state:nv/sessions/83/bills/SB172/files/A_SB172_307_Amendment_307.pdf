AN ACT relating to employment; enacting the Agricultural Workers’ Bill of
Rights; revising [and establishing] provisions relating to [the payment
of wages and] the provision of periods for rest and meals; establishing
certain rights of agricultural workers related to housing and access to
certain service providers; prohibiting certain actions related to weeding
and thinning; requiring the provision of certain protections to
agricultural workers during certain emergencies and disasters;
authorizing collective bargaining for agricultural workers; authorizing
the commencement of a civil action in certain circumstances; creating
the Advisory Committee on Agricultural Work; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law [establishes provisions related to the payment of minimum wage and
2 overtime for certain hours worked. (Nev. Const. Art. 15, § 16; NRS 608.018, 608.250)
3 Additionally, existing law] prescribes periods for rest and meals for employees during work
4 hours. (NRS 608.019) Section 2 of this bill provides that an employer may not employ an
5 agricultural employee for a continuous period of 5 hours without authorizing the
6 agricultural employee to have a meal period of at least one-half hour.
7 Existing law authorizes wages and compensation to include lodging and meals under
8 certain circumstances and prohibits the lodging and meals from being valued more than
9 certain amounts for purposes of computing the wages and compensation. Existing law,
10 however, exempts agricultural employees from these prohibitions on the computable
11 value of the lodging and meals. (NRS 608.154, 608.155) Sections 3 and 4 of this bill
12 remove these exemptions for agricultural employees, thereby providing that the
13 prohibitions on the computable value of lodging and meals apply to agricultural
14 employees.
15 Section 1.3 of this bill defines the term “agricultural employee” for the purposes of
16 this bill. Sections 1.7, 4.3 and 4.7 of this bill make conforming changes related to the
17 applicability of the definition contained in section 1.3.
18 Existing law also prohibits various employment practices. (Chapter 613 of NRS) Sections
19 6-21 of this bill establish the Agricultural Workers’ Bill of Rights. Section 9 defines
20 “agricultural worker” as a worker engaged in certain agriculture or farming services or
21 activities described in section 203(f) of the federal Fair Labor Standards Act.

Senate Amendment No. 307 to Senate Bill No. 172 Page 4
22 Section 11 entitles an agricultural worker who lives in housing provided by an
23 agricultural employer to reasonable access for visitors. Sections 12 and 13 entitle an
24 agricultural worker to reasonable access to key service providers at certain times during
25 working hours and afford the agricultural worker the right to be transported to key service
26 providers under certain circumstances.
27 Section 14 prohibits persons from taking certain actions that restrict the ability of an
28 agricultural worker to enter or leave the residence of the agricultural worker.
29 Additionally, section 15, with certain exceptions, prohibits certain conduct related to
30 weeding or thinning by hand or using a short-handed hoe in a stooped, kneeling or squatting
31 position.
32 Section 16 requires agricultural employers to post certain notices related to the provisions
33 established in sections 11-15.
34 Section 17 requires agricultural employers, during periods of emergency or disaster, to:
35 (1) meet certain requirements related to housing provided to agricultural workers; and (2)
36 supply certain information to the agricultural workers.
37 [Section 18 requires the Labor Commissioner to adopt regulations for the purposes of
38 extending the provisions related to the payment of wages and the provision of certain other
39 employee benefits to agricultural workers. Sections 1-4 of this bill make conforming changes
40 to reflect the changes made by sections 6-21.]
41 Section 19 authorizes agricultural workers to organize and form collective bargaining
42 units.
43 Section 20 establishes a civil remedy for certain persons who are aggrieved by violations
44 of the Agricultural Workers’ Bill of Rights.
45 Section 21 creates the Advisory Committee on Agricultural Work and prescribes its
46 membership and duties.
