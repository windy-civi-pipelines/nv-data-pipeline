Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the governing body of certain cities and counties to adopt
2 at least 6 of 12 specified measures in implementing a plan for maintaining and
3 developing affordable housing, which may include a measure to reduce or subsidize
4 impact fees, fees for the issuance of building permits and fees imposed for the
5 purpose for which an enterprise fund was created to assist in maintaining or
6 developing a project for affordable housing. The use of this measure is subject to
7 certain requirements, including that, when the incomes of all residents of the
8 project are averaged, the housing would be affordable on average for a family with
9 a total gross income that does not exceed 60 percent of the median gross income for
10 the county based upon certain estimates of the most current median gross family
11 income for the county. (NRS 278.235) Section 1 of this bill increases this threshold
12 from 60 percent to 120 percent.
13 Existing law authorizes the governing body of a municipality to designate a tax
14 increment area for the purpose of creating a special account for the payment of
15 bonds or other securities to defray the cost of certain undertakings, which is defined
16 to include various projects based on the mechanism used to create the tax increment
17 area, including a drainage and flood control project, an overpass project, a sewerage
18 project, a street project, an underpass project, a water project, a natural resources
19 project or a rail project. The designation of a tax increment area provides for the
20 allocation of a portion of the taxes levied upon taxable property in the tax
-

24 the definition of undertaking to include: (1) an affordable housing project; (2) a
25 fixed guideway project; (3) a high-capacity transit project; (4) a multi-family
26 housing project; (5) a transit-oriented development; and (6) a transportation project.
27 Sections 3-11 of this bill define these projects and certain terms relating to these
28 projects.
29 Section 12 of this bill establishes requirements for a governing body of a
30 municipality to order one of these undertakings, including that the tax increment
31 area be located: (1) in an area designated for transit-oriented development or
32 another land use specified in the master plan adopted by the governing body; and
33 (2) not more than one-half mile from certain structures for a fixed guideway or
34 high-capacity transit project. Section 12 also requires the governing body to ensure
35 that the area chosen for the tax increment area meets certain other requirements.
36 Section 12 further requires that if a governing body adopts an ordinance
37 designating the tax increment area and ordering one of these undertakings: (1) the
38 ordinance may include additional requirements for the tax increment area and
39 undertaking; and (2) the governing body must file an exhibit with the ordinance that
40 addresses the determination of the governing body that the area chosen for the tax
41 increment area meets these requirements.
