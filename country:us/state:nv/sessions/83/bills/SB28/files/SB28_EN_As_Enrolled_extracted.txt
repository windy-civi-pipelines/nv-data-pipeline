Section 1:
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to municipalities; establishing requirements for a
tax increment area for certain projects relating to
transportation or affordable housing; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law authorizes the governing body of a municipality to designate a tax
increment area for the purpose of creating a special account for the payment of
bonds or other securities to defray the cost of certain undertakings, which is defined
to include various projects based on the mechanism used to create the tax increment
area, including a drainage and flood control project, an overpass project, a sewerage
project, a street project, an underpass project, a water project, a natural resources
project or a rail project. The designation of a tax increment area provides for the
allocation of a portion of the taxes levied upon taxable property in the tax
increment area each year to pay the bond requirements of loans, money advanced to
or indebtedness incurred by the municipality to finance or refinance the
undertaking. (NRS 278C.140, 278C.150, 278C.250) Section 13 of this bill revises
the definition of undertaking to include: (1) an affordable housing project; (2) a
fixed guideway project; (3) a high-capacity transit project; (4) a multi-family
housing project; (5) a transit-oriented development; and (6) a transportation project.

Section 2:
Sections 3-11 of this bill define these projects and certain terms relating to these
projects.

Section 3:
Section 12 of this bill establishes requirements for a governing body of a
municipality to order one of these undertakings, including that the tax increment
area be located: (1) in an area designated for transit-oriented development or
another land use specified in the master plan adopted by the governing body; and
(2) not more than one-half mile from certain structures for a fixed guideway or
high-capacity transit project. Section 12 also requires the governing body to ensure
that the area chosen for the tax increment area meets certain other requirements.

Section 4:
Section 12 further requires that if a governing body adopts an ordinance
designating the tax increment area and ordering one of these undertakings: (1) the
ordinance may include additional requirements for the tax increment area and
undertaking; and (2) the governing body must file an exhibit with the ordinance that
addresses the determination of the governing body that the area chosen for the tax
increment area meets these requirements.
