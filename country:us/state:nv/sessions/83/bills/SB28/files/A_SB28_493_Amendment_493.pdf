AN ACT relating to municipalities; [revising requirements relating to a reduction or
subsidization of certain fees for a project for affordable housing;]
establishing requirements for a tax increment area for certain projects
relating to transportation or affordable housing; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 [Existing law requires the governing body of certain cities and counties to adopt at least 6
2 of 12 specified measures in implementing a plan for maintaining and developing affordable
3 housing, which may include a measure to reduce or subsidize impact fees, fees for the
4 issuance of building permits and fees imposed for the purpose for which an enterprise fund
5 was created to assist in maintaining or developing a project for affordable housing. The use of
6 this measure is subject to certain requirements, including that, when the incomes of all
7 residents of the project are averaged, the housing would be affordable on average for a family
8 with a total gross income that does not exceed 60 percent of the median gross income for the
9 county based upon certain estimates of the most current median gross family income for the
10 county. (NRS 278.235) Section 1 of this bill increases this threshold from 60 percent to 120
11 percent.]
12 Existing law authorizes the governing body of a municipality to designate a tax increment
13 area for the purpose of creating a special account for the payment of bonds or other securities
14 to defray the cost of certain undertakings, which is defined to include various projects based
15 on the mechanism used to create the tax increment area, including a drainage and flood
16 control project, an overpass project, a sewerage project, a street project, an underpass project,
17 a water project, a natural resources project or a rail project. The designation of a tax increment
18 area provides for the allocation of a portion of the taxes levied upon taxable property in the
19 tax increment area each year to pay the bond requirements of loans, money advanced to or
20 indebtedness incurred by the municipality to finance or refinance the undertaking. (NRS
21 278C.140, 278C.150, 278C.250) Section 13 of this bill revises the definition of undertaking to
22 include: (1) an affordable housing project; (2) a fixed guideway project; (3) a high-capacity
23 transit project; (4) a multi-family housing project; (5) a transit-oriented development; and (6)
24 a transportation project. Sections 3-11 of this bill define these projects and certain terms
25 relating to these projects.
26 Section 12 of this bill establishes requirements for a governing body of a municipality to
27 order one of these undertakings, including that the tax increment area be located: (1) in an

Senate Amendment No. 493 to Senate Bill No. 28 Page 4
28 area designated for transit-oriented development or another land use specified in the master
29 plan adopted by the governing body; and (2) not more than one-half mile from certain
30 structures for a fixed guideway or high-capacity transit project. Section 12 also requires the
31 governing body to ensure that the area chosen for the tax increment area meets certain other
32 requirements. Section 12 further requires that if a governing body adopts an ordinance
33 designating the tax increment area and ordering one of these undertakings: (1) the ordinance
34 may include additional requirements for the tax increment area and undertaking; and (2) the
35 governing body must file an exhibit with the ordinance that addresses the determination of the
36 governing body that the area chosen for the tax increment area meets these requirements.
