EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to hemp; setting forth certain requirements and
restrictions concerning consumable hemp products;
revising the powers and duties of the Cannabis
Compliance Board to include certain powers and duties
relating to consumable hemp products; revising
provisions governing the maximum THC concentration
for hemp; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates the Cannabis Compliance Board to license and regulate
2 persons and establishments involved in the cannabis industry in this State. (Title 56
3 of NRS) Sections 3, 4, 6, 7 and 9 of this bill require the Board to take certain
4 actions relating to the regulation of consumable hemp products. Section 2 of this
5 bill defines “consumable hemp product” to mean hemp, a commodity or product
6 containing hemp or a commodity or product purporting to contain cannabidiol that:
7 (1) has a THC concentration that does not exceed the maximum THC concentration
8 for hemp; and (2) is intended for human consumption. Section 2 excludes from the
9 definition of “consumable hemp product” a commodity or product that contains
10 only an approved hemp component and no other hemp.
11 Section 3 prohibits a person from manufacturing, storing, distributing,
12 advertising, marketing, selling or offering to sell a consumable hemp product in this
13 State with a THC concentration that exceeds the limit of detection, which section 3
14 defines to mean the lowest concentration of THC that can be reliably detected using
15 a method of testing established by the Board by regulation. Section 3 additionally:
16 (1) prohibits a person from selling or offering to sell a consumable hemp product
17 with a THC concentration that does not exceed the limit of detection to a person
18 who is under 21 years of age; and (2) requires such a product to be sold in a single
19 package that meets certain requirements. Section 3 also requires a person who
20 manufactures a consumable hemp product to maintain and provide to the Board
21 upon request a certificate of analysis issued by a cannabis independent testing
-

– 2 –
22 laboratory indicating that the consumable hemp product contains a THC
23 concentration that does not exceed the limit of detection.
24 Section 3 requires the Board to adopt certain regulations governing consumable
25 hemp products, which must: (1) establish requirements relating to testing and
26 serving sizes of such products; (2) establish requirements and restrictions for the
27 marketing and advertising of such products; and (3) provide for the investigation of
28 violations of the provisions of section 3 and for the imposition of penalties against
29 persons who commit such violations.
30 Existing law authorizes the Board to seize and destroy cannabis and cannabis
31 products involved in unlicensed cannabis activities in accordance with the
32 procedures set forth in existing law governing seizure and forfeiture. (NRS
33 678A.440) Sections 3, 6 and 11 of this bill similarly authorize the Board to seize
34 and destroy consumable hemp products that violate the provisions of section 3 in
35 accordance with such procedures. Section 6 additionally authorizes the Board to
36 commit resources and take certain actions to address violations of section 3.
37 Section 4 creates an account in the State General Fund which is administered
38 by the Board to carry out the purposes of section 3. Section 5 of this bill makes a
39 conforming change so that the definition of a consumable hemp product set forth in
40 section 2 applies to the provisions of existing law governing the cannabis industry.
41 Section 7 provides for the testing of consumable hemp products by a cannabis
42 independent testing laboratory. Sections 8 and 10 of this bill revise existing
43 provisions setting forth certain authorizations and requirements for cannabis
44 establishments which engage in certain activities relating to hemp to specify that
45 the requirements and restrictions relating to consumable hemp products set forth in
46 section 3 apply to a cannabis establishment.
47 Existing law prohibits a person from selling or offering to sell any commodity
48 or product containing hemp which is intended for human consumption or any other
49 commodity or product that purports to contain cannabidiol with a THC
50 concentration that does not exceed the maximum THC concentration established by
51 federal law for hemp unless the commodity or product has been tested and is
52 labeled in accordance with requirements established by the Department of Health
53 and Human Services. (NRS 439.532) Section 12 of this bill specifies that such
54 requirements: (1) are in addition to the requirements set forth in section 3; and (2)
55 do not apply to a cannabis establishment.
56 Existing law requires the State Department of Agriculture to establish the
57 maximum THC concentration for hemp. (NRS 557.160, 557.260) Sections 14 and
58 16 of this bill: (1) remove the authority of the Department to establish the
59 maximum THC concentration for hemp; and (2) revise the definition of “hemp” to
60 require hemp to have a THC concentration that does not exceed 0.3 percent on a
61 dry weight basis, as measured using post-decarboxylation or another similarly
62 reliable testing method. Sections 13, 15, 17 and 18 of this bill make conforming
63 changes to revise other references in existing law to the maximum THC
64 concentration of hemp.

S.B. 356
SENATE BILL NO. 356–SENATOR ROGICH
MARCH 17, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Commerce and Labor
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to hemp. (BDR 56-916)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to hemp; setting forth certain requirements and
restrictions concerning consumable hemp products;
revising the powers and duties of the Cannabis
Compliance Board to include certain powers and duties
relating to consumable hemp products; revising
provisions governing the maximum THC concentration
for hemp; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates the Cannabis Compliance Board to license and regulate
2 persons and establishments involved in the cannabis industry in this State. (Title 56
3 of NRS) Sections 3, 4, 6, 7 and 9 of this bill require the Board to take certain
4 actions relating to the regulation of consumable hemp products. Section 2 of this
5 bill defines “consumable hemp product” to mean hemp, a commodity or product
6 containing hemp or a commodity or product purporting to contain cannabidiol that:
7 (1) has a THC concentration that does not exceed the maximum THC concentration
8 for hemp; and (2) is intended for human consumption. Section 2 excludes from the
9 definition of “consumable hemp product” a commodity or product that contains
10 only an approved hemp component and no other hemp.
11 Section 3 prohibits a person from manufacturing, storing, distributing,
12 advertising, marketing, selling or offering to sell a consumable hemp product in this
13 State with a THC concentration that exceeds the limit of detection, which section 3
14 defines to mean the lowest concentration of THC that can be reliably detected using
15 a method of testing established by the Board by regulation. Section 3 additionally:
16 (1) prohibits a person from selling or offering to sell a consumable hemp product
17 with a THC concentration that does not exceed the limit of detection to a person
18 who is under 21 years of age; and (2) requires such a product to be sold in a single
19 package that meets certain requirements. Section 3 also requires a person who
20 manufactures a consumable hemp product to maintain and provide to the Board
21 upon request a certificate of analysis issued by a cannabis independent testing
-
*SB356*

– 2 –
22 laboratory indicating that the consumable hemp product contains a THC
23 concentration that does not exceed the limit of detection.
24 Section 3 requires the Board to adopt certain regulations governing consumable
25 hemp products, which must: (1) establish requirements relating to testing and
26 serving sizes of such products; (2) establish requirements and restrictions for the
27 marketing and advertising of such products; and (3) provide for the investigation of
28 violations of the provisions of section 3 and for the imposition of penalties against
29 persons who commit such violations.
30 Existing law authorizes the Board to seize and destroy cannabis and cannabis
31 products involved in unlicensed cannabis activities in accordance with the
32 procedures set forth in existing law governing seizure and forfeiture. (NRS
33 678A.440) Sections 3, 6 and 11 of this bill similarly authorize the Board to seize
34 and destroy consumable hemp products that violate the provisions of section 3 in
35 accordance with such procedures. Section 6 additionally authorizes the Board to
36 commit resources and take certain actions to address violations of section 3.
37 Section 4 creates an account in the State General Fund which is administered
38 by the Board to carry out the purposes of section 3. Section 5 of this bill makes a
39 conforming change so that the definition of a consumable hemp product set forth in
40 section 2 applies to the provisions of existing law governing the cannabis industry.
41 Section 7 provides for the testing of consumable hemp products by a cannabis
42 independent testing laboratory. Sections 8 and 10 of this bill revise existing
43 provisions setting forth certain authorizations and requirements for cannabis
44 establishments which engage in certain activities relating to hemp to specify that
45 the requirements and restrictions relating to consumable hemp products set forth in
46 section 3 apply to a cannabis establishment.
47 Existing law prohibits a person from selling or offering to sell any commodity
48 or product containing hemp which is intended for human consumption or any other
49 commodity or product that purports to contain cannabidiol with a THC
50 concentration that does not exceed the maximum THC concentration established by
51 federal law for hemp unless the commodity or product has been tested and is
52 labeled in accordance with requirements established by the Department of Health
53 and Human Services. (NRS 439.532) Section 12 of this bill specifies that such
54 requirements: (1) are in addition to the requirements set forth in section 3; and (2)
55 do not apply to a cannabis establishment.
56 Existing law requires the State Department of Agriculture to establish the
57 maximum THC concentration for hemp. (NRS 557.160, 557.260) Sections 14 and
58 16 of this bill: (1) remove the authority of the Department to establish the
59 maximum THC concentration for hemp; and (2) revise the definition of “hemp” to
60 require hemp to have a THC concentration that does not exceed 0.3 percent on a
61 dry weight basis, as measured using post-decarboxylation or another similarly
62 reliable testing method. Sections 13, 15, 17 and 18 of this bill make conforming
63 changes to revise other references in existing law to the maximum THC
64 concentration of hemp.
