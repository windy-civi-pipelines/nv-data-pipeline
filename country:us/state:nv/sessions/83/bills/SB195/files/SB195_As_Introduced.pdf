12 the county and city clerks and submit a summary to the Director of the Legislative
13 Counsel Bureau for transmittal to the Legislature or Legislative Commission, as

17 the fourth day following the election; or (2) delivered by hand to the county or city
18 clerk or any drop box before the time set for closing of the polls on election day.

35 the signature used for the mail ballot that the voter failed to affix his or her
36 signature or failed to affix it in the manner required by law for the mail ballot or
37 that there is a reasonable question of fact as to whether the signature used for the
38 mail ballot matches the signature of the voter, but the voter is otherwise entitled to
39 cast the mail ballot, the clerk shall contact the voter and advise the voter of the
40 procedures to provide a signature or a confirmation that the signature used for
41 the mail ballot belongs to the voter, as applicable. For the mail ballot to be counted,
42 the voter must provide a signature or a confirmation, as applicable, not later than 5
