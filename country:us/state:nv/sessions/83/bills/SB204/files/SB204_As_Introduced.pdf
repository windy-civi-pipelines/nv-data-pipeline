AN ACT relating to wages; authorizing a temporary agricultural
foreign worker who performs herding or production of
livestock on the range under an H-2A visa and his or her
employer to enter into a written agreement to exclude
from the wages of the worker certain specified periods for
meals, sleep and other free time; exempting an employer
of a temporary agricultural foreign worker who performs
herding or production of livestock on the range under an
H-2A visa from certain recordkeeping requirements;
requiring the enforcement of certain provisions relating to
payment of wages and prosecution of violations thereof;
providing a penalty; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing federal law, an H-2A visa permits certain persons to work in the
2 United States as a temporary nonimmigrant agricultural worker. Regulations of the
3 United States Department of Labor establish minimum wages and working
4 conditions for H-2A workers, including temporary agricultural foreign workers
5 who perform herding or production of livestock on the range. Under the H-2A visa
6 program, employers must offer, advertise in recruitment and pay each temporary
7 agricultural foreign worker who performs herding or production of livestock on the
8 range a wage that is at least the highest of various wage sources listed in those
9 federal regulations, including the applicable minimum wage imposed by state law.
10 (8 U.S.C. § 1188; 20 C.F.R. §§ 655.200-655.235) Section 1 of this bill designates
11 such a worker as an “H-2A visa herder” for the purposes of the provisions of this
12 bill.

13 Existing law requires an employer to pay wages to an employee for each hour
14 the employee works. (NRS 608.016) Existing law authorizes a domestic service
15 employee who resides in the household where he or she works and his or her
16 employer to exclude from the domestic service employee’s wages certain periods
17 for meals, sleep and other periods of complete freedom. (NRS 608.215) Sections 1-
18 5 of this bill enact similar provisions for H-2A visa herders.
19 Section 1 authorizes an H-2A visa herder and his or her employer to agree in
20 writing to exclude from the herder’s wages certain periods for meals, sleep and
21 other periods of complete freedom from all duties. Under section 1, if a period
22 excluded from the H-2A visa herder’s wages is interrupted by a call to duty, the
23 interruption must be counted as hours worked for which compensation must be
24 paid. Section 1 also provides that if it is found by the parties that there is a
25 significant deviation from the initial agreement, a separate record must be kept for
26 the period in which the deviation occurs or a new agreement must be reached that
27 reflects the actual facts.
28 Existing law requires every employer to establish and maintain records of
29 wages for each employee, including, with certain exceptions, the total hours
30 employed in the pay period by noting the number of hours per day. (NRS 608.115)
31 Section 3 of this bill exempts an employer of an H-2A visa herder from this
32 requirement.
33 Section 4 of this bill requires the Labor Commissioner or the representative of
34 the Labor Commissioner to cause the provisions of this bill to be enforced and
35 violations thereof to be prosecuted. Section 5 of this bill provides that a person who
36 violates the provisions of this bill, or any regulation adopted pursuant thereto, is
37 guilty of a misdemeanor.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN

5 (a) Periods for meals if the period for meals is at least one-half

7 (b) Periods for sleep if the period for sleep excluded from the
8 wages of the H-2A visa herder does not exceed 8 hours; and
9 (c) Any other period of complete freedom from all duties
10 during which the H-2A visa herder stays on the premises and
11 engages purely personal pursuits. To be excluded from the wages
12 of the H-2A visa herder pursuant to this paragraph, a period must
13 be of sufficient duration to enable the H-2A visa herder to make
14 effective use of the time.
15 2. If a period excluded from the wages of the H-2A visa
16 herder pursuant to this section is interrupted by a call to duty by
17 the employer, the interruption must be counted as hours worked
18 for which compensation must be paid.
