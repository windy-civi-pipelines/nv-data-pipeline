EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to firearms; prohibiting, under certain
circumstances, the possession of a firearm in or within a
certain distance of an election site; requiring the county
clerk, registrar of voters or city clerk, as applicable, to
post a sign at each election site notifying persons that
possession of a firearm is prohibited within a certain
distance of the site; providing penalties; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits a person from carrying or possessing certain weapons on
2 the property of the Nevada System of Higher Education, a private or public school
3 or a child care facility, or while in a vehicle of a private or public school or child
4 care facility. (NRS 202.265) Section 1 of this bill additionally prohibits a person
5 from possessing or causing a firearm to be present in, or within 100 feet of an
6 entrance to, a place the person knows or reasonably should know is an election site,
7 unless the person: (1) is a law enforcement officer engaged in the performance of
8 his or her official duties; (2) is an off-duty law enforcement officer who is lawfully
9 carrying a concealed firearm; (3) is a private security guard or other security
10 personnel hired by the owner of the facility or property in which the election site is
11 located; (4) possesses the firearm while in a vehicle, so long as the person does not
12 brandish the firearm or remove the firearm from the vehicle; or (5) lawfully
13 possesses a firearm in a place of residence, in a business or on private property that
14 is located within 100 feet of an entrance to an election site. Under section 1, a
15 person who violates this prohibition is guilty of a gross misdemeanor, except if the
16 person knowingly possesses a firearm or causes a firearm to be present with the
17 specific intent to disrupt, interfere with or monitor the administration of the
18 election, the counting of votes or any person who is voting or attempting to vote,

20 defense for a person who was lawfully in possession of a firearm and was traveling
21 within 100 feet of an election site solely for the purpose of accessing private
22 property located within that area or departing from such property. Section 1 further:
23 (1) requires the county clerk, registrar of voters or city clerk, as applicable, to post a
24 sign at each election site notifying persons that the possession of a firearm is
25 prohibited; and (2) specifies certain requirements relating to the sign.
26 Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to make the existing
