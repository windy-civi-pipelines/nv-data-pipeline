EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to firearms; prohibiting, under certain circumstances, the
possession of a firearm in or within a certain distance of an election
site; requiring the county clerk, registrar of voters or city clerk, as
applicable, to post a sign at each election site notifying persons that
possession of a firearm is prohibited within a certain distance of
the site; providing penalties; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits a person from carrying or possessing certain weapons on the
2 property of the Nevada System of Higher Education, a private or public school or a child care
3 facility, or while in a vehicle of a private or public school or child care facility. (NRS
4 202.265) Section 1 of this bill additionally prohibits a person from possessing or causing a
5 firearm to be present in, or within 100 feet of an entrance to, a place the person knows or
6 reasonably should know is an election site, unless the person: (1) is a law enforcement officer
7 engaged in the performance of his or her official duties; (2) is an off-duty law enforcement
8 officer who is lawfully carrying a concealed firearm; (3) is a private security guard or other
9 security personnel hired by the owner of the facility or property in which the election site is
10 located; [(3)] (4) possesses the firearm while in a vehicle, so long as the person does not
11 brandish the firearm or remove the firearm from the vehicle; or [(4)] (5) lawfully possesses a
12 firearm in a place of residence, in a business or on private property that is located within 100
13 feet of an entrance to an election site. Under section 1, a person who violates this prohibition
14 is guilty of a gross misdemeanor, except if the person knowingly possesses a firearm or causes
15 a firearm to be present with the specific intent to disrupt, interfere with or monitor the
16 administration of the election, the counting of votes or any person who is voting or attempting
17 to vote, the person is guilty of a category D felony. Section 1 also establishes an affirmative
18 defense for a person who was lawfully in possession of a firearm and was traveling
19 within 100 feet of an election site solely for the purpose of accessing private property
20 located within that area or departing from such property. Section 1 further: (1) requires
21 the county clerk, registrar of voters or city clerk, as applicable, to post a sign at each
22 election site notifying persons that the possession of a firearm is prohibited; and (2)
23 specifies certain requirements relating to the sign.
