AN ACT relating to firearms; prohibiting, under certain
circumstances, the possession of a firearm in or within a
certain distance of an election site; providing penalties;

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prohibits a person from carrying or possessing certain weapons on
2 the property of the Nevada System of Higher Education, a private or public school
3 or a child care facility, or while in a vehicle of a private or public school or child
4 care facility. (NRS 202.265) Section 1 of this bill additionally prohibits a person
5 from possessing or causing a firearm to be present in, or within 100 feet of an
6 entrance to, a place the person knows or reasonably should know is an election site,
7 unless the person: (1) is a law enforcement officer engaged in the performance of
8 his or her official duties; (2) is a private security guard or other security personnel
9 hired by the owner of the facility or property in which the election site is located;
10 (3) possesses the firearm while in a vehicle, so long as the person does not brandish
11 the firearm or remove the firearm from the vehicle; or (4) lawfully possesses a
12 firearm in a place of residence, in a business or on private property that is located
13 within 100 feet of an entrance to an election site. Under section 1, a person who
14 violates this prohibition is guilty of a gross misdemeanor, except if the person
15 knowingly possesses a firearm or causes a firearm to be present with the specific
16 intent to disrupt, interfere with or monitor the administration of the election, the
17 counting of votes or any person who is voting or attempting to vote, the person is
18 guilty of a category D felony.
19 Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to make the existing
20 definitions that apply to certain crimes involving the ownership or possession of a
21 firearm by certain persons applicable to section 1.
