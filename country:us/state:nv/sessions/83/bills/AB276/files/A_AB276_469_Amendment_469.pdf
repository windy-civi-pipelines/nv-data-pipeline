EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to taxation; increasing and providing for the adjustment of the
gross revenue threshold above which the gross revenue of a business
entity is subject to the commerce tax; prohibiting the payment of
interest on an overpayment of commerce tax resulting from the use
of a gross revenue threshold other than the adjusted threshold
calculated and published by the Department of Taxation; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law imposes an annual commerce tax on each business entity whose Nevada
2 gross revenue in a fiscal year exceeds $4,000,000, with the rate of commerce tax based on the
3 industry in which the business entity is primarily engaged. Existing law imposes the tax only
4 on the portion of the Nevada gross revenue of a business entity that is in excess of $4,000,000.
5 (NRS 363C.200, 363C.300-363C.560) Sections 4 and 6 of this bill eliminate the $4,000,000
6 Nevada gross revenue threshold and replace it with a revenue threshold that is calculated on
7 an annual basis. Section 4 provides the method for calculating the revenue threshold for a
8 taxable year. For the taxable year beginning on July 1, 2025, section 4 sets the revenue
9 threshold at $4,000,000 plus an additional amount that is determined by multiplying
10 $4,000,000 by the average 12-month percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for All
11 Urban Consumers, West Region (All Items) for the 3 calendar years immediately preceding
12 July 1, 2025. For all subsequent taxable years, section 4 provides that the revenue threshold
13 is: (1) the same as the previous taxable year, if the average 12-month change in the Consumer
14 Price Index for All Urban Consumers, West Region (All Items) for the previous 3 calendar
15 years is negative; or (2) increased from the previous taxable year by an amount equal to the
16 revenue threshold from the previous taxable year multiplied by the average 12-month
17 percentage increase in Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, West Region (All
18 Items) for the previous 3 calendar years, if the average 12-month percentage change for that
19 period was positive. Under section 4, the revenue threshold calculated for each taxable
20 year must be rounded to the nearest $100,000. Section 6 requires a business entity whose
21 Nevada gross revenue in a taxable year exceeds the revenue threshold calculated as described
22 in section 4 to file a return for that taxable year and excuses all business entities whose
23 Nevada gross revenue is equal to or less than the revenue threshold from the requirement to
24 file such a return for that taxable year. Sections 2, 3 and 5 of this bill define the terms
25 “consumer price inflation index” and “revenue threshold” for the purposes of the provisions
26 governing the commerce tax. Sections 7-33 of this bill make conforming changes to

Assembly Amendment No. 469 to Assembly Bill No. 276 Page 4
27 provisions governing the calculation of the commerce tax owed by a business entity to reflect
28 that any Nevada gross revenue of a business entity that is equal to or below the revenue
29 threshold is excluded from the calculation of the commerce tax.
30 Under existing law, a business entity that overpays the commerce tax is entitled to a
31 refund of the amount of the overpayment if, with certain exceptions, the business entity
32 claims the refund within a certain period. (NRS 363C.600) With certain exceptions,
33 existing law requires such a business entity to be paid interest on any overpayment of
34 any amount of the commerce tax at a rate specified in existing law. However, the
35 Department of Taxation is prohibited from paying interest to a business entity if the
36 Department determines that any overpayment has been made intentionally or by reason
37 of carelessness. (NRS 363C.620) Section 33.5 of this bill prohibits the Department from
38 paying interest on such an overpayment of the commerce tax because a business entity
39 uses a revenue threshold to calculate the amount of commerce tax it owes other than the
40 revenue threshold calculated by the Department and published pursuant to section 4.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 363C of NRS is hereby amended by adding thereto the
2 provisions set forth as sections 2, 3 and 4 of this act.
3 Sec. 2. “Consumer price inflation index” means the Consumer Price Index
4 for All Urban Consumers, West Region (All Items), as published by the United
5 States Department of Labor or, if that index ceases to be published by the United
6 States Department of Labor, the published index selected by the Department of
7 Taxation pursuant to subsection 11 of NRS 361.091.
8 Sec. 3. “Revenue threshold” means the amount described in subsection 1
9 of section 4 of this act for a given taxable year.
10 Sec. 4. 1. The revenue threshold is:
11 (a) For the taxable year beginning on July 1, 2025, $4,000,000 plus the
12 product of $4,000,000 multiplied by the average 12-month percentage increase in
13 the consumer price inflation index for the 3 calendar years immediately
14 preceding the taxable year beginning on July 1, 2025. The revenue threshold
15 calculated pursuant to this paragraph must be rounded to the nearest $100,000.
16 (b) For each subsequent taxable year:
17 (1) If the average 12-month percentage change in the consumer price
18 inflation index for the 3 calendar years immediately preceding the taxable year
19 for which the revenue threshold is being calculated is positive, the revenue
20 threshold for the immediate preceding taxable year plus the product of the
21 revenue threshold for the immediately preceding taxable year multiplied by the
22 average percentage increase in the consumer price inflation index for the 3
23 calendar years immediately preceding the taxable year for which the revenue
24 threshold is being calculated. A revenue threshold calculated pursuant to this
25 subparagraph must be rounded to the nearest $100,000.
26 (2) If the average 12-month percentage change in the consumer price
27 inflation index for the 3 calendar years immediately preceding the taxable year
28 for which the revenue threshold is being calculated is negative, an amount equal
29 to the revenue threshold for the immediately preceding taxable year. A revenue
30 threshold calculated pursuant to this subparagraph must be rounded to the
31 nearest $100,000.
32 2. [On or before March 1 of each year,] Not later than 30 days after July 1,
33 2025, the Department shall calculate and publish on its Internet website the
34 revenue threshold for the taxable year that began on July 1, 2025. Not later than

7 Sec. 6. NRS 363C.200 is hereby amended to read as follows:
8 363C.200 1. For the privilege of engaging in a business in this State, a
9 commerce tax is hereby imposed upon each business entity whose Nevada gross
10 revenue in a taxable year exceeds [$4,000,000] the revenue threshold in an amount
11 determined pursuant to NRS 363C.300 to 363C.560, inclusive. The commerce tax
12 is due and payable as provided in this section.
13 2. Each business entity whose Nevada gross revenue in a taxable year exceeds
14 [$4,000,000] the revenue threshold shall, on or before the 45th day immediately

16 prescribed by the Department. The Department shall not require a business entity
17 whose Nevada gross revenue for a taxable year is [$4,000,000] equal to or less
18 than the revenue threshold to file a return for that taxable year. The return required
19 by this subsection must include such information as is required by the Department.
20 3. For the purposes of determining the amount of the commerce tax due
21 pursuant to this chapter, the initial return filed by a business entity with the
22 Department pursuant to subsection 2 must designate the business category in which
23 the business entity is primarily engaged. A business entity may not change the
24 business category designated for that business entity unless the person applies to the

27 4. A business entity shall remit with the return the amount of commerce tax
28 due pursuant to subsection 1. Upon written application made before the date on

31 which a business entity is required to pay the commerce tax. If the commerce tax is
32 paid during the period of extension, no penalty or late charge may be imposed for
33 failure to pay the commerce tax at the time required, but the business entity shall
34 pay interest at the rate of 0.75 percent per month from the date on which the
