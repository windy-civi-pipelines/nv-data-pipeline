EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to taxation; increasing and providing for the
adjustment of the gross revenue threshold above which
the gross revenue of a business entity is subject to the
commerce tax; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law imposes an annual commerce tax on each business entity whose
2 Nevada gross revenue in a fiscal year exceeds $4,000,000, with the rate of
3 commerce tax based on the industry in which the business entity is primarily
4 engaged. Existing law imposes the tax only on the portion of the Nevada gross
5 revenue of a business entity that is in excess of $4,000,000. (NRS 363C.200,
6 363C.300-363C.560) Sections 4 and 6 of this bill eliminate the $4,000,000 Nevada
7 gross revenue threshold and replace it with a revenue threshold that is calculated on
8 an annual basis. Section 4 provides the method for calculating the revenue
9 threshold for a taxable year. For the taxable year beginning on July 1, 2025, section
10 4 sets the revenue threshold at $4,000,000 plus an additional amount that is
11 determined by multiplying $4,000,000 by the average 12-month percentage
12 increase in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, West Region (All
13 Items) for the 3 calendar years immediately preceding July 1, 2025. For all
14 subsequent taxable years, section 4 provides that the revenue threshold is: (1) the
15 same as the previous taxable year, if the average 12-month change in the Consumer
16 Price Index for All Urban Consumers, West Region (All Items) for the previous 3
17 calendar years is negative; or (2) increased from the previous taxable year by an
18 amount equal to the revenue threshold from the previous taxable year multiplied by
19 the average 12-month percentage increase in Consumer Price Index for All Urban
20 Consumers, West Region (All Items) for the previous 3 calendar years, if the
21 average 12-month percentage change for that period was positive. Section 6
22 requires a business entity whose Nevada gross revenue in a taxable year exceeds
23 the revenue threshold calculated as described in section 4 to file a return for that

– 2 –
24 taxable year and excuses all business entities whose Nevada gross revenue is equal
25 to or less than the revenue threshold from the requirement to file such a return for
26 that taxable year. Sections 2, 3 and 5 of this bill define the terms “consumer price
27 inflation index” and “revenue threshold” for the purposes of the provisions
28 governing the commerce tax. Sections 7-33 of this bill make conforming changes
29 to provisions governing the calculation of the commerce tax owed by a business
30 entity to reflect that any Nevada gross revenue of a business entity that is equal to
31 or below the revenue threshold is excluded from the calculation of the commerce
32 tax.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

12 Sec. 4. 1. The revenue threshold is:

14 plus the product of $4,000,000 multiplied by the average 12-month
15 percentage increase in the consumer price inflation index for the 3
16 calendar years immediately preceding the taxable year beginning
17 on July 1, 2025.
18 (b) For each subsequent taxable year:
19 (1) If the average 12-month percentage change in the
20 consumer price inflation index for the 3 calendar years
21 immediately preceding the taxable year for which the revenue
22 threshold is being calculated is positive, the revenue threshold for
23 the immediate preceding taxable year plus the product of the
24 revenue threshold for the immediately preceding taxable year
25 multiplied by the average percentage increase in the consumer
26 price inflation index for the 3 calendar years immediately
27 preceding the taxable year for which the revenue threshold is
28 being calculated.
29 (2) If the average 12-month percentage change in the
