EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to taxation; increasing and providing for the
adjustment of the gross revenue threshold above which
the gross revenue of a business entity is subject to the
commerce tax; prohibiting the payment of interest on an
overpayment of commerce tax resulting from the use of a
gross revenue threshold other than the adjusted threshold
calculated and published by the Department of Taxation;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law imposes an annual commerce tax on each business entity whose
2 Nevada gross revenue in a fiscal year exceeds $4,000,000, with the rate of
3 commerce tax based on the industry in which the business entity is primarily
4 engaged. Existing law imposes the tax only on the portion of the Nevada gross
5 revenue of a business entity that is in excess of $4,000,000. (NRS 363C.200,
6 363C.300-363C.560) Sections 4 and 6 of this bill eliminate the $4,000,000 Nevada
7 gross revenue threshold and replace it with a revenue threshold that is calculated on
8 an annual basis. Section 4 provides the method for calculating the revenue
9 threshold for a taxable year. For the taxable year beginning on July 1, 2025, section
10 4 sets the revenue threshold at $4,000,000 plus an additional amount that is
11 determined by multiplying $4,000,000 by the average 12-month percentage
12 increase in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, West Region (All
13 Items) for the 3 calendar years immediately preceding July 1, 2025. For all
14 subsequent taxable years, section 4 provides that the revenue threshold is: (1) the
15 same as the previous taxable year, if the average 12-month change in the Consumer
16 Price Index for All Urban Consumers, West Region (All Items) for the previous 3
17 calendar years is negative; or (2) increased from the previous taxable year by an
18 amount equal to the revenue threshold from the previous taxable year multiplied by
19 the average 12-month percentage increase in Consumer Price Index for All Urban

20 Consumers, West Region (All Items) for the previous 3 calendar years, if the
21 average 12-month percentage change for that period was positive. Under section 4,
22 the revenue threshold calculated for each taxable year must be rounded to the
23 nearest $100,000. Section 6 requires a business entity whose Nevada gross revenue
24 in a taxable year exceeds the revenue threshold calculated as described in section 4
25 to file a return for that taxable year and excuses all business entities whose Nevada
26 gross revenue is equal to or less than the revenue threshold from the requirement to
27 file such a return for that taxable year. Sections 2, 3 and 5 of this bill define the
28 terms “consumer price inflation index” and “revenue threshold” for the purposes of
29 the provisions governing the commerce tax. Sections 7-33 of this bill make
30 conforming changes to provisions governing the calculation of the commerce tax
31 owed by a business entity to reflect that any Nevada gross revenue of a business
32 entity that is equal to or below the revenue threshold is excluded from the
33 calculation of the commerce tax.
34 Under existing law, a business entity that overpays the commerce tax is entitled
35 to a refund of the amount of the overpayment if, with certain exceptions, the
36 business entity claims the refund within a certain period. (NRS 363C.600) With
37 certain exceptions, existing law requires such a business entity to be paid interest
38 on any overpayment of any amount of the commerce tax at a rate specified in
39 existing law. However, the Department of Taxation is prohibited from paying
40 interest to a business entity if the Department determines that any overpayment has
41 been made intentionally or by reason of carelessness. (NRS 363C.620) Section
42 33.5 of this bill prohibits the Department from paying interest on such an
43 overpayment of the commerce tax because a business entity uses a revenue
44 threshold to calculate the amount of commerce tax it owes other than the revenue
45 threshold calculated by the Department and published pursuant to section 4.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
