EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; authorizing the board of trustees of a
school district or governing body of a charter school to
provide a stipend to certain teachers who teach pupils
enrolled in a program of bilingual education; requiring
information concerning such stipends to be included in
certain reports prepared by the board of trustees of each
school district and the governing body of each charter
school; requiring the Commission on Professional
Standards in Education to adopt regulations requiring
teachers to hold an endorsement to teach pupils enrolled
in a program of bilingual education; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates the Commission on Professional Standards in Education
2 and requires the Commission to adopt regulations prescribing the qualifications for
3 licensing teachers and other educational personnel. (NRS 391.011, 391.019) Under
4 existing law, such regulations must include a requirement that to be eligible to
5 teach in a field of specialization, a teacher is required to obtain from the
6 Department of Education an endorsement in that field of specialization, unless the
7 Superintendent of Public Instruction approves a request submitted by the board of
8 trustees of a school district to employ licensed teachers who do not hold an
9 endorsement to teach in a subject area for which there is a shortage of teachers at a
10 public school within the district. (NRS 391.019, 391.125) Existing regulations: (1)
11 require that to teach pupils enrolled in a program of bilingual education, a person
12 must hold an endorsement issued by the Department to teach pupils in a program of
-
*SB115_R2*

– 2 –
13 bilingual education and pass an examination or assessment to demonstrate language
14 proficiency; and (2) establish the requirements for a person to obtain such an
15 endorsement. (NAC 391.059, 391.242) Section 4 of this bill specifically requires
16 the regulations adopted by the Commission to include a requirement that to teach
17 pupils enrolled in a program of bilingual education, a person must hold an
18 endorsement issued by the Department to teach pupils in a program of bilingual
19 education. Section 3 of this bill authorizes the board of trustees of a school district
20 or the governing body of a charter school to provide a stipend of $2,500 each
21 school year to each teacher who is assigned to teach pupils enrolled in a program of
22 bilingual education and who: (1) holds an endorsement to teach pupils enrolled in a
23 program of bilingual education; or (2) is currently enrolled in a course of study or
24 program of preparation that will satisfy the educational requirements to obtain an
25 endorsement to teach pupils enrolled in a program of bilingual education and is
26 authorized by law to teach pupils enrolled in such a program. If such a stipend is
27 provided by a school district which has more than 100,000 pupils enrolled in its
28 public schools (currently Clark County School District) or a charter school, section
29 3 requires such a stipend to be paid out of the budget of the local school precinct or
30 charter school at which the teacher receiving the stipend is employed. For the
31 purposes of sections 3 and 4, a “program of bilingual education” is defined as a
32 program of instruction for English learners in which pupils are taught the English
33 language and the content of other courses of study is taught in the pupil’s primary
34 language.
35 Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district and the
36 governing body of each charter school to submit an annual report to certain entities
37 that includes certain information on budgets and expenditures. (NRS 387.303,
38 388A.345) Sections 1 and 2 of this bill require such a report to additionally include
39 information on the number of employees who received the stipend described in
40 section 3 in the preceding and then-current fiscal years.
