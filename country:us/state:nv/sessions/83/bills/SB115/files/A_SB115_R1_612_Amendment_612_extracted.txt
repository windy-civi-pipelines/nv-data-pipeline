EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; authorizing the board of trustees of a school district
or governing body of a charter school to provide a stipend to certain
teachers who teach pupils enrolled in a program of bilingual education;
requiring information concerning such stipends to be included in
certain reports prepared by the board of trustees of each school district
and the governing body of each charter school; requiring the
Commission on Professional Standards in Education to adopt
regulations requiring teachers to hold an endorsement to teach pupils
enrolled in a program of bilingual education; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates the Commission on Professional Standards in Education and requires
2 the Commission to adopt regulations prescribing the qualifications for licensing teachers and
3 other educational personnel. (NRS 391.011, 391.019) Under existing law, such regulations
4 must include a requirement that to be eligible to teach in a field of specialization, a teacher is
5 required to obtain from the Department of Education an endorsement in that field of
6 specialization, unless the Superintendent of Public Instruction approves a request submitted by
7 the board of trustees of a school district to employ licensed teachers who do not hold an
8 endorsement to teach in a subject area for which there is a shortage of teachers at a public
9 school within the district. (NRS 391.019, 391.125) Existing regulations: (1) require that to
10 teach pupils enrolled in a program of bilingual education, a person must hold an endorsement
11 issued by the Department to teach pupils in a program of bilingual education and pass an
12 examination or assessment to demonstrate language proficiency; and (2) establish the
13 requirements for a person to obtain such an endorsement. (NAC 391.059, 391.242) Section 4
14 of this bill specifically requires the regulations adopted by the Commission to include a
15 requirement that to teach pupils enrolled in a program of bilingual education, a person must
16 hold an endorsement issued by the Department to teach pupils in a program of bilingual
17 education. Section 3 of this bill authorizes the board of trustees of a school district or the
18 governing body of a charter school to provide a stipend of $2,500 each school year to each
19 teacher who is assigned to teach pupils enrolled in a program of bilingual education and who :
Assembly Amendment No. 612 to Senate Bill No. 115 First Reprint Page 4
20 (1) holds an endorsement to teach pupils enrolled in a program of bilingual education [.] ; or
21 (2) is currently enrolled in a course of study or program of preparation that will satisfy
22 the educational requirements to obtain an endorsement to teach pupils enrolled in a
23 program of bilingual education and is authorized by law to teach pupils enrolled in such
24 a program. If such a stipend is provided by a school district which has more than 100,000
25 pupils enrolled in its public schools (currently Clark County School District) or a charter
26 school, section 3 requires such a stipend to be paid out of the budget of the local school
27 precinct or charter school at which the teacher receiving the stipend is employed. For the
28 purposes of sections 3 and 4, a “program of bilingual education” is defined as a program of
29 instruction for English learners in which pupils are taught the English language and the
30 content of other courses of study is taught in the pupil’s primary language.
31 Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district and the governing body
32 of each charter school to submit an annual report to certain entities that includes certain
33 information on budgets and expenditures. (NRS 387.303, 388A.345) Sections 1 and 2 of this
34 bill require such a report to additionally include information on the number of employees who
35 received the stipend described in section 3 in the preceding and then-current fiscal years.

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; authorizing the board of trustees of a school district
or governing body of a charter school to provide a stipend to certain
teachers who teach pupils enrolled in a program of bilingual education;
requiring information concerning such stipends to be included in
certain reports prepared by the board of trustees of each school district
and the governing body of each charter school; requiring the
Commission on Professional Standards in Education to adopt
regulations requiring teachers to hold an endorsement to teach pupils
enrolled in a program of bilingual education; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates the Commission on Professional Standards in Education and requires
2 the Commission to adopt regulations prescribing the qualifications for licensing teachers and
3 other educational personnel. (NRS 391.011, 391.019) Under existing law, such regulations
4 must include a requirement that to be eligible to teach in a field of specialization, a teacher is
5 required to obtain from the Department of Education an endorsement in that field of
6 specialization, unless the Superintendent of Public Instruction approves a request submitted by
7 the board of trustees of a school district to employ licensed teachers who do not hold an
8 endorsement to teach in a subject area for which there is a shortage of teachers at a public
9 school within the district. (NRS 391.019, 391.125) Existing regulations: (1) require that to
10 teach pupils enrolled in a program of bilingual education, a person must hold an endorsement
11 issued by the Department to teach pupils in a program of bilingual education and pass an
12 examination or assessment to demonstrate language proficiency; and (2) establish the
13 requirements for a person to obtain such an endorsement. (NAC 391.059, 391.242) Section 4
14 of this bill specifically requires the regulations adopted by the Commission to include a
15 requirement that to teach pupils enrolled in a program of bilingual education, a person must
16 hold an endorsement issued by the Department to teach pupils in a program of bilingual
17 education. Section 3 of this bill authorizes the board of trustees of a school district or the
18 governing body of a charter school to provide a stipend of $2,500 each school year to each
19 teacher who is assigned to teach pupils enrolled in a program of bilingual education and who :

Assembly Amendment No. 612 to Senate Bill No. 115 First Reprint Page 4
20 (1) holds an endorsement to teach pupils enrolled in a program of bilingual education [.] ; or
21 (2) is currently enrolled in a course of study or program of preparation that will satisfy
22 the educational requirements to obtain an endorsement to teach pupils enrolled in a
23 program of bilingual education and is authorized by law to teach pupils enrolled in such
24 a program. If such a stipend is provided by a school district which has more than 100,000
25 pupils enrolled in its public schools (currently Clark County School District) or a charter
26 school, section 3 requires such a stipend to be paid out of the budget of the local school
27 precinct or charter school at which the teacher receiving the stipend is employed. For the
28 purposes of sections 3 and 4, a “program of bilingual education” is defined as a program of
29 instruction for English learners in which pupils are taught the English language and the
30 content of other courses of study is taught in the pupil’s primary language.
31 Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district and the governing body
32 of each charter school to submit an annual report to certain entities that includes certain
33 information on budgets and expenditures. (NRS 387.303, 388A.345) Sections 1 and 2 of this
34 bill require such a report to additionally include information on the number of employees who
35 received the stipend described in section 3 in the preceding and then-current fiscal years.
