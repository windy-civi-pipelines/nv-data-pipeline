CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to education; authorizing the board of trustees of a
school district or governing body of a charter school to
provide a stipend to certain teachers who teach pupils
enrolled in a program of bilingual education; requiring
information concerning such stipends to be included in
certain reports prepared by the board of trustees of each
school district and the governing body of each charter school;
requiring the Commission on Professional Standards in
Education to adopt regulations requiring teachers to hold an
endorsement to teach pupils enrolled in a program of
bilingual education; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law creates the Commission on Professional Standards in Education
and requires the Commission to adopt regulations prescribing the qualifications for
licensing teachers and other educational personnel. (NRS 391.011, 391.019) Under
existing law, such regulations must include a requirement that to be eligible to
teach in a field of specialization, a teacher is required to obtain from the
Department of Education an endorsement in that field of specialization, unless the
Superintendent of Public Instruction approves a request submitted by the board of
trustees of a school district to employ licensed teachers who do not hold an
endorsement to teach in a subject area for which there is a shortage of teachers at a
public school within the district. (NRS 391.019, 391.125) Existing regulations: (1)
require that to teach pupils enrolled in a program of bilingual education, a person
must hold an endorsement issued by the Department to teach pupils in a program of
bilingual education and pass an examination or assessment to demonstrate language
proficiency; and (2) establish the requirements for a person to obtain such an
endorsement. (NAC 391.059, 391.242) Section 4 of this bill specifically requires
the regulations adopted by the Commission to include a requirement that to teach
pupils enrolled in a program of bilingual education, a person must hold an
endorsement issued by the Department to teach pupils in a program of bilingual
education. Section 3 of this bill authorizes the board of trustees of a school district
or the governing body of a charter school to provide a stipend of $2,500 each
school year to each teacher who is assigned to teach pupils enrolled in a program of
bilingual education and who: (1) holds an endorsement to teach pupils enrolled in a
program of bilingual education; or (2) is currently enrolled in a course of study or
program of preparation that will satisfy the educational requirements to obtain an
endorsement to teach pupils enrolled in a program of bilingual education and is
authorized by law to teach pupils enrolled in such a program. If such a stipend is
provided by a school district which has more than 100,000 pupils enrolled in its
public schools (currently Clark County School District) or a charter school, section
3 requires such a stipend to be paid out of the budget of the local school precinct or
charter school at which the teacher receiving the stipend is employed. For the
purposes of sections 3 and 4, a “program of bilingual education” is defined as a
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 2 –
program of instruction for English learners in which pupils are taught the English
language and the content of other courses of study is taught in the pupil’s primary
language.
Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district and the
governing body of each charter school to submit an annual report to certain entities
that includes certain information on budgets and expenditures. (NRS 387.303,
388A.345) Sections 1 and 2 of this bill require such a report to additionally include
information on the number of employees who received the stipend described in

Section 2:
section 3 in the preceding and then-current fiscal years.

CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to education; authorizing the board of trustees of a
school district or governing body of a charter school to
provide a stipend to certain teachers who teach pupils
enrolled in a program of bilingual education; requiring
information concerning such stipends to be included in
certain reports prepared by the board of trustees of each

requiring the Commission on Professional Standards in
Education to adopt regulations requiring teachers to hold an
endorsement to teach pupils enrolled in a program of

relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law creates the Commission on Professional Standards in Education
and requires the Commission to adopt regulations prescribing the qualifications for
licensing teachers and other educational personnel. (NRS 391.011, 391.019) Under
existing law, such regulations must include a requirement that to be eligible to
teach in a field of specialization, a teacher is required to obtain from the
Department of Education an endorsement in that field of specialization, unless the
Superintendent of Public Instruction approves a request submitted by the board of
trustees of a school district to employ licensed teachers who do not hold an
endorsement to teach in a subject area for which there is a shortage of teachers at a
public school within the district. (NRS 391.019, 391.125) Existing regulations: (1)
require that to teach pupils enrolled in a program of bilingual education, a person
must hold an endorsement issued by the Department to teach pupils in a program of
bilingual education and pass an examination or assessment to demonstrate language
proficiency; and (2) establish the requirements for a person to obtain such an
endorsement. (NAC 391.059, 391.242) Section 4 of this bill specifically requires
the regulations adopted by the Commission to include a requirement that to teach
pupils enrolled in a program of bilingual education, a person must hold an
endorsement issued by the Department to teach pupils in a program of bilingual
education. Section 3 of this bill authorizes the board of trustees of a school district
or the governing body of a charter school to provide a stipend of $2,500 each
school year to each teacher who is assigned to teach pupils enrolled in a program of
bilingual education and who: (1) holds an endorsement to teach pupils enrolled in a
program of bilingual education; or (2) is currently enrolled in a course of study or
program of preparation that will satisfy the educational requirements to obtain an
endorsement to teach pupils enrolled in a program of bilingual education and is
authorized by law to teach pupils enrolled in such a program. If such a stipend is
provided by a school district which has more than 100,000 pupils enrolled in its
public schools (currently Clark County School District) or a charter school, section
3 requires such a stipend to be paid out of the budget of the local school precinct or
charter school at which the teacher receiving the stipend is employed. For the
purposes of sections 3 and 4, a “program of bilingual education” is defined as a

Existing law requires the board of trustees of each school district and the
governing body of each charter school to submit an annual report to certain entities
that includes certain information on budgets and expenditures. (NRS 387.303,
