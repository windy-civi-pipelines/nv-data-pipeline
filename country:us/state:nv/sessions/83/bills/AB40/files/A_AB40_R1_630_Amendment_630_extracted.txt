Senate Amendment No. 630 to Assembly Bill No. 40 First Reprint Page 4
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes provisions governing the reclamation of land subject to mining
2 operations or exploration projects. (Chapter 519A of NRS) Section 13 of this bill revises the
3 definition of the term “reclamation” to include actions performed during or after an
4 exploration project or mining operation to stabilize process fluids. Sections 2-9 of this bill
5 define certain terms relating to reclamation. Section 14 of this bill revises the definition of the
6 term “surety” to include an account held by or for the benefit of the Division of
7 Environmental Protection of the State Department of Conservation and Natural Resources.
8 Section 10 of this bill authorizes the Division to issue an order if the Division has
9 reasonable cause to believe that a holder of a permit is violating or is about to violate certain
10 provisions of existing law relating to the reclamation of land.
11 Section 11 of this bill provides that the Division may lien all real and personal property
12 associated with a facility of a holder of a permit for an exploration project or mining
13 operation.
14 Section 12 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law and sections 2-9 governing
15 reclamation to the provisions of sections 10 and 11.
16 Section 15 of this bill authorizes certain fees collected by the Division that are used to
17 administer the provisions of existing law relating to reclamation to also be used to administer
18 the provisions of sections 2-11.
19 Existing law requires an applicant for a permit to engage in a mining operation to,
20 amongst other requirements, complete a checklist developed by the Division and file a plan
21 for reclamation with the application. (NRS 519A.210, 519A.220) Section 16 of this bill
22 requires that the information requested by the checklist include a manual for the operation and
23 maintenance of the fluid management system for the mining operation. Section 17 of this bill
24 requires a plan for reclamation to provide for the stabilization of process fluids.
25 Existing law provides that if an exploration project or a mining operation is conducted on:
26 (1) land administered by a federal agency, an approved federal plan of operations and surety
27 that are consistent with certain requirements supersede certain requirements for a permit and
28 bond or other surety; or (2) both public land and privately owned land, compliance with the
29 approved federal plan of operations is sufficient if that plan substantially provides for the
30 reclamation and bond or other surety required by existing law. (NRS 519A.240) Section 18 of
31 this bill provides that a federal plan of operations and surety approved by a federal agency for
32 an exploration project or a mining operation supersede, if wholly conducted on land
33 administered by a federal agency, or substitute, if partly conducted on land administered by a
34 federal agency, requirements in state law for a permit and bond or other surety if the
35 applicant: (1) submits to the Division the federal plan of operations and an estimate of the
36 costs of reclamation; and (2) remedies any inconsistencies identified by the Division between
37 the federal plan of operations and the requirements of state law.
38 Sections 19 and 20 of this bill apply certain disciplinary actions and criminal penalties to
39 the provisions of sections 2-11.
40 Existing law requires the governing body of every municipality or district board of health
41 of a health district to develop a plan to provide for a solid waste management system which
42 provides for the management and disposal of solid waste. (NRS 444.510) Existing law defines
43 the term “solid waste management system” as the entire process of storage, collection,
44 transportation, processing, recycling and disposal of solid waste. (NRS 444.500) Section 28.3
45 of this bill revises the definition of “solid waste management system” to mean the entire
46 process of storage, collection, transportation, processing, recycling or disposal of solid waste.
47 Existing law requires a solid waste management authority to issue permits to operate
48 disposal sites. (NRS 444.553) Section 28.7 of this bill requires a solid waste management
49 authority to also issue permits to operate solid waste management facilities. Section 28.7 also
50 authorizes a solid waste management authority to take certain actions to determine
51 whether the owner or operator of a solid waste management facility is in compliance
52 with certain requirements. Section 32.1 of this bill requires the State Environmental
53 Commission to adopt regulations concerning standards for the issuance, renewal,
54 modification, suspension, revocation and denial of, and for the imposition of terms and
55 conditions for, a permit to construct or operate a solid waste management facility. Sections
56 32.1-32.4 and 32.8 of this bill make certain provisions of existing law relating to disposal
57 sites applicable to solid waste management facilities.
Senate Amendment No. 630 to Assembly Bill No. 40 First Reprint Page 5
58 Section 22 of this bill defines the term “solid waste management facility” to mean any
59 place that engages in any activity related to a solid waste management system. Section 23.5 of
60 this bill authorizes the State Environmental Commission to adopt regulations establishing
61 activities that are related to a solid waste management system and the places which constitute
62 a solid waste management facility based on the activities performed at the place.
63 Existing law requires the owner or operator of a municipal solid waste landfill to obtain a
64 permit from a solid waste management authority before constructing or operating the
65 municipal solid waste landfill. The permit must be conditioned upon all requirements
66 necessary to ensure compliance with certain federal laws governing solid waste, including
67 financial requirements for the owners and operators of municipal solid waste landfills. (NRS
68 444.465, 444.556) Section 30 of this bill revises certain references to the term “municipal
69 solid waste landfill.” Section 32.6 of this bill revises a reference to a sanitary landfill with a
70 reference to a municipal solid waste landfill. Section 32 of this bill prohibits a municipal solid
71 waste landfill from accepting hazardous waste from a very small quantity generator.
72 Section 24 of this bill requires the Commission to adopt regulations prescribing the
73 requirements for an owner or operator of a municipal solid waste landfill or solid waste
74 management facility engaged in certain activities to demonstrate financial responsibility.
75 Section 29 of this bill provides that certain requirements for a permit relating to standards
76 of care and financial responsibility may be satisfied by a plan for reclamation under certain
77 circumstances.
78 Section 25 of this bill provides that the Division or solid waste management authority
79 may lien all real and personal property associated with a municipal solid waste landfill or
80 solid waste management facility of an owner or operator of the municipal solid waste landfill
81 or solid waste management facility.
82 Section 26 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law and section 22 governing the
83 collection and disposal of solid waste to the provisions of sections 22-25.
84 Existing law establishes provisions governing the disposal of hazardous waste through the
85 management of hazardous waste, which is defined as the systematic control of the generation,
86 collection, storage, transportation, processing, treatment, recovery and disposal of hazardous
87 waste. (NRS 459.400-459.600) Section 39 of this bill revises: (1) the definition of the
88 management of hazardous waste to mean the systematic control of the generation, collection,
89 storage, transportation, recycling, processing, treatment, recovery or disposal of hazardous
90 waste; and as a result: (2) expands the applicability of these requirements governing
91 hazardous waste to include recycling as a method for the disposal of hazardous waste and any
92 systematic control of the generation, collection, storage, transportation, recycling, processing,
93 treatment, recovery or disposal of hazardous waste.
94 Sections 36, 40, 44, 46-51, 52 and 53 of this bill remove references to specific activities
95 constituting the management of hazardous waste. Sections 37.5, 38.5 and 40-41 of this bill
96 revise certain definitions relating to the disposal of hazardous waste.
97 Sections 46, 53 and 54 of this bill apply certain existing criminal and civil penalties and
98 disciplinary actions to the management of hazardous waste.
99 Section 34 of this bill defines the term “recycling” to mean the processing of hazardous
100 waste to recover materials or produce a usable product. Section 36 establishes that an
101 additional purpose of the provisions of existing law governing the disposal of hazardous waste
102 includes conserving resources of material and energy through the recycling or recovery of
103 hazardous waste.
104 Section 35 of this bill provides that the Department may lien all real and personal
105 property associated with a facility for the management of hazardous waste of the owner,
106 operator or holder of a permit of the facility.
107 Section 37 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law and section 34 governing the
108 disposal of hazardous waste to the provisions of sections 34 and 35.
109 Existing law requires the Commission, through the Department, to develop a program to
110 encourage the minimization of hazardous waste and the recycling or reuse of hazardous waste.
111 (NRS 459.485) Section 43 of this bill removes the requirement that the program include the
112 reuse of hazardous waste.
113 Existing law prohibits a person from constructing, substantially altering or operating a
114 facility for the treatment, storage or disposal of hazardous waste or treating, storing or
115 disposing of hazardous waste unless the person has first obtained a permit from the
116 Department. (NRS 459.515) Section 46 provides that the person must only obtain a permit if
Senate Amendment No. 630 to Assembly Bill No. 40 First Reprint Page 6
117 the Commission has required by regulation that type of facility to obtain a permit. Section 47
118 requires the Commission to adopt regulations establishing the types of facilities for the
119 management of hazardous waste which must obtain a permit.
120 Existing law requires the Commission to adopt regulations requiring the owner or
121 operator of any facility for the treatment, storage or disposal of hazardous waste to show his
122 or her financial responsibility for the undertaking. (NRS 459.525) Section 48 requires the
123 Commission to adopt regulations establishing the types of facilities for the management of
124 hazardous waste which must show financial responsibility.
125 Existing law provides that certain provisions of existing law authorizing any authorized
126 representative or employee of the Commission or Department to conduct certain inspections
127 relating to hazardous substances and authorizing the Department to issue certain orders
128 relating to hazardous substances do not apply in a county whose population is less than 55,000
129 (currently all counties except Clark County, Washoe County, Lyon County and Carson City).
130 (NRS 459.558) Section 51.5 of this bill removes this exemption.
131 Existing law prohibits a person from transporting hazardous waste to a facility that has
132 not been issued a permit to treat, store or dispose of hazardous waste. (NRS 459.590) Section
133 54.5 of this bill instead prohibits a person from transporting hazardous waste to a facility that
134 has not been authorized to accept hazardous waste in accordance with certain regulations
135 adopted by the Commission.

23 2. The operator may request the Division to grant an exception for open pits
24 and rock faces which may not be feasible to reclaim. If an exception is granted,
25 other than for a pit lake for which public access is provided in a plan for
26 reclamation pursuant to subsection 3, the Division shall require the operator to take
27 sufficient measures to ensure public safety.
28 3. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, for a pit lake that will have
29 a predicted filled surface area of more than 200 acres, a plan for reclamation must
30 provide, in consultation with the operator and each landowner, including any
31 federal land manager, and, if feasible, for at least one point of public nonmotorized
32 access to the water level of the pit lake when the pit in which the pit lake is located
33 reaches at least 90 percent of its predicted maximum capacity. This subsection:
34 (a) Must not be construed to impede the ability of any landowner, including
35 any federal land manager, of any premises on which a pit lake is located to
36 determine the final and ultimate use of those premises;
37 (b) Does not require any landowner, including any federal land manager, who

41 4. A protected person with respect to any premises for which public access to
42 a pit lake is provided in a plan for reclamation pursuant to subsection 3 owes no
43 duty to keep the premises, including, without limitation, the access area and the pit
44 lake and its surroundings, safe for entry or use by any other person for participation
45 in any activity, or to give a warning of any hazardous condition, activity or use of
46 the premises to any person entering the premises.
47 5. If a protected person gives permission to another person to access or
48 engage in any activity with respect to any premises specified in subsection 4, the
49 protected person does not thereby extend any assurance that the premises are safe
50 for that activity or any other purpose or assume responsibility for or incur any
51 liability for any injury to any person or property caused by any act of a person to
52 whom the permission is granted. The provisions of this subsection do not confer
53 any liability upon a protected person for any injury to any other person or property,
Senate Amendment No. 630 to Assembly Bill No. 40 First Reprint Page 11
1 whether actual or implied, or create a duty of care or ground of liability for any
2 injury to any person or property.
3 6. Except in the case of an emergency, an operator shall not depart from an
4 approved plan for reclamation without prior written approval from the Division.
5 7. Reclamation activities must be economically and technologically
6 practicable in achieving a safe and stable condition suitable for the use of the land.
7 8. As used in this section:

24 with the requirements of this chapter supersede , if wholly conducted on land
25 administered by the federal agency, or substitute, if partly conducted on land
26 administered by the federal agency, the requirements for a permit and bond or
27 other surety otherwise required by this chapter [. If the mining operation or
28 exploration project is conducted on a site which includes both public land and

21 owner or operator; or
22 (b) The owner or operator might have asserted, had the claim been made

Senate Amendment No. 630 to Assembly Bill No. 40 First Reprint Page 4
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes provisions governing the reclamation of land subject to mining
2 operations or exploration projects. (Chapter 519A of NRS) Section 13 of this bill revises the
3 definition of the term “reclamation” to include actions performed during or after an
4 exploration project or mining operation to stabilize process fluids. Sections 2-9 of this bill
5 define certain terms relating to reclamation. Section 14 of this bill revises the definition of the
6 term “surety” to include an account held by or for the benefit of the Division of
7 Environmental Protection of the State Department of Conservation and Natural Resources.
8 Section 10 of this bill authorizes the Division to issue an order if the Division has
9 reasonable cause to believe that a holder of a permit is violating or is about to violate certain
10 provisions of existing law relating to the reclamation of land.
11 Section 11 of this bill provides that the Division may lien all real and personal property
12 associated with a facility of a holder of a permit for an exploration project or mining
13 operation.
14 Section 12 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law and sections 2-9 governing
15 reclamation to the provisions of sections 10 and 11.
16 Section 15 of this bill authorizes certain fees collected by the Division that are used to
17 administer the provisions of existing law relating to reclamation to also be used to administer
18 the provisions of sections 2-11.
19 Existing law requires an applicant for a permit to engage in a mining operation to,
20 amongst other requirements, complete a checklist developed by the Division and file a plan
21 for reclamation with the application. (NRS 519A.210, 519A.220) Section 16 of this bill
22 requires that the information requested by the checklist include a manual for the operation and
23 maintenance of the fluid management system for the mining operation. Section 17 of this bill
24 requires a plan for reclamation to provide for the stabilization of process fluids.
25 Existing law provides that if an exploration project or a mining operation is conducted on:
26 (1) land administered by a federal agency, an approved federal plan of operations and surety
27 that are consistent with certain requirements supersede certain requirements for a permit and
28 bond or other surety; or (2) both public land and privately owned land, compliance with the
29 approved federal plan of operations is sufficient if that plan substantially provides for the
30 reclamation and bond or other surety required by existing law. (NRS 519A.240) Section 18 of
31 this bill provides that a federal plan of operations and surety approved by a federal agency for
32 an exploration project or a mining operation supersede, if wholly conducted on land
33 administered by a federal agency, or substitute, if partly conducted on land administered by a
34 federal agency, requirements in state law for a permit and bond or other surety if the
35 applicant: (1) submits to the Division the federal plan of operations and an estimate of the
36 costs of reclamation; and (2) remedies any inconsistencies identified by the Division between
37 the federal plan of operations and the requirements of state law.
38 Sections 19 and 20 of this bill apply certain disciplinary actions and criminal penalties to
39 the provisions of sections 2-11.
40 Existing law requires the governing body of every municipality or district board of health
41 of a health district to develop a plan to provide for a solid waste management system which
42 provides for the management and disposal of solid waste. (NRS 444.510) Existing law defines
43 the term “solid waste management system” as the entire process of storage, collection,
44 transportation, processing, recycling and disposal of solid waste. (NRS 444.500) Section 28.3
45 of this bill revises the definition of “solid waste management system” to mean the entire
46 process of storage, collection, transportation, processing, recycling or disposal of solid waste.
47 Existing law requires a solid waste management authority to issue permits to operate
48 disposal sites. (NRS 444.553) Section 28.7 of this bill requires a solid waste management
49 authority to also issue permits to operate solid waste management facilities. Section 28.7 also
50 authorizes a solid waste management authority to take certain actions to determine
51 whether the owner or operator of a solid waste management facility is in compliance
52 with certain requirements. Section 32.1 of this bill requires the State Environmental
53 Commission to adopt regulations concerning standards for the issuance, renewal,
54 modification, suspension, revocation and denial of, and for the imposition of terms and
55 conditions for, a permit to construct or operate a solid waste management facility. Sections
56 32.1-32.4 and 32.8 of this bill make certain provisions of existing law relating to disposal
57 sites applicable to solid waste management facilities.

Senate Amendment No. 630 to Assembly Bill No. 40 First Reprint Page 5
58 Section 22 of this bill defines the term “solid waste management facility” to mean any
59 place that engages in any activity related to a solid waste management system. Section 23.5 of
60 this bill authorizes the State Environmental Commission to adopt regulations establishing
61 activities that are related to a solid waste management system and the places which constitute
62 a solid waste management facility based on the activities performed at the place.
63 Existing law requires the owner or operator of a municipal solid waste landfill to obtain a
64 permit from a solid waste management authority before constructing or operating the
65 municipal solid waste landfill. The permit must be conditioned upon all requirements
66 necessary to ensure compliance with certain federal laws governing solid waste, including
67 financial requirements for the owners and operators of municipal solid waste landfills. (NRS
68 444.465, 444.556) Section 30 of this bill revises certain references to the term “municipal
69 solid waste landfill.” Section 32.6 of this bill revises a reference to a sanitary landfill with a
70 reference to a municipal solid waste landfill. Section 32 of this bill prohibits a municipal solid
71 waste landfill from accepting hazardous waste from a very small quantity generator.
72 Section 24 of this bill requires the Commission to adopt regulations prescribing the
73 requirements for an owner or operator of a municipal solid waste landfill or solid waste
74 management facility engaged in certain activities to demonstrate financial responsibility.
75 Section 29 of this bill provides that certain requirements for a permit relating to standards
76 of care and financial responsibility may be satisfied by a plan for reclamation under certain
77 circumstances.
78 Section 25 of this bill provides that the Division or solid waste management authority
79 may lien all real and personal property associated with a municipal solid waste landfill or
80 solid waste management facility of an owner or operator of the municipal solid waste landfill
81 or solid waste management facility.
82 Section 26 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law and section 22 governing the
83 collection and disposal of solid waste to the provisions of sections 22-25.
84 Existing law establishes provisions governing the disposal of hazardous waste through the
85 management of hazardous waste, which is defined as the systematic control of the generation,
86 collection, storage, transportation, processing, treatment, recovery and disposal of hazardous
87 waste. (NRS 459.400-459.600) Section 39 of this bill revises: (1) the definition of the
88 management of hazardous waste to mean the systematic control of the generation, collection,
89 storage, transportation, recycling, processing, treatment, recovery or disposal of hazardous
90 waste; and as a result: (2) expands the applicability of these requirements governing
91 hazardous waste to include recycling as a method for the disposal of hazardous waste and any
92 systematic control of the generation, collection, storage, transportation, recycling, processing,
93 treatment, recovery or disposal of hazardous waste.
94 Sections 36, 40, 44, 46-51, 52 and 53 of this bill remove references to specific activities
95 constituting the management of hazardous waste. Sections 37.5, 38.5 and 40-41 of this bill
96 revise certain definitions relating to the disposal of hazardous waste.
97 Sections 46, 53 and 54 of this bill apply certain existing criminal and civil penalties and
98 disciplinary actions to the management of hazardous waste.
99 Section 34 of this bill defines the term “recycling” to mean the processing of hazardous
100 waste to recover materials or produce a usable product. Section 36 establishes that an
101 additional purpose of the provisions of existing law governing the disposal of hazardous waste
102 includes conserving resources of material and energy through the recycling or recovery of
103 hazardous waste.
104 Section 35 of this bill provides that the Department may lien all real and personal
105 property associated with a facility for the management of hazardous waste of the owner,
106 operator or holder of a permit of the facility.
107 Section 37 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law and section 34 governing the
108 disposal of hazardous waste to the provisions of sections 34 and 35.
109 Existing law requires the Commission, through the Department, to develop a program to
110 encourage the minimization of hazardous waste and the recycling or reuse of hazardous waste.
111 (NRS 459.485) Section 43 of this bill removes the requirement that the program include the
112 reuse of hazardous waste.
113 Existing law prohibits a person from constructing, substantially altering or operating a
114 facility for the treatment, storage or disposal of hazardous waste or treating, storing or
115 disposing of hazardous waste unless the person has first obtained a permit from the
116 Department. (NRS 459.515) Section 46 provides that the person must only obtain a permit if

Senate Amendment No. 630 to Assembly Bill No. 40 First Reprint Page 6
117 the Commission has required by regulation that type of facility to obtain a permit. Section 47
118 requires the Commission to adopt regulations establishing the types of facilities for the
119 management of hazardous waste which must obtain a permit.
120 Existing law requires the Commission to adopt regulations requiring the owner or
121 operator of any facility for the treatment, storage or disposal of hazardous waste to show his
122 or her financial responsibility for the undertaking. (NRS 459.525) Section 48 requires the
123 Commission to adopt regulations establishing the types of facilities for the management of
124 hazardous waste which must show financial responsibility.
125 Existing law provides that certain provisions of existing law authorizing any authorized
126 representative or employee of the Commission or Department to conduct certain inspections
127 relating to hazardous substances and authorizing the Department to issue certain orders
128 relating to hazardous substances do not apply in a county whose population is less than 55,000
129 (currently all counties except Clark County, Washoe County, Lyon County and Carson City).
130 (NRS 459.558) Section 51.5 of this bill removes this exemption.
131 Existing law prohibits a person from transporting hazardous waste to a facility that has
132 not been issued a permit to treat, store or dispose of hazardous waste. (NRS 459.590) Section
133 54.5 of this bill instead prohibits a person from transporting hazardous waste to a facility that
134 has not been authorized to accept hazardous waste in accordance with certain regulations
135 adopted by the Commission.

1 8. The Attorney General may, on behalf of the Division, foreclose on a
2 perfected lien in a suit brought in district court in the same manner as a suit for
3 the foreclosure of any other lien.
4 9. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the right of the
5 Division to bring an action to recover any costs and damages for which a person
6 is liable under the provisions of this chapter.
7 Sec. 12. NRS 519A.020 is hereby amended to read as follows:

12 519A.100 “Reclamation” means actions performed during or after an
13 exploration project or mining operation to [shape,] :
14 1. Shape, stabilize, revegetate or otherwise treat the land in order to return it
15 to a safe, stable condition consistent with the establishment of a productive
16 postmining use of the land and the abandonment of a facility in a manner which
17 ensures the public safety, as well as the encouragement of techniques which
18 minimize the adverse visual effects [.] ; or
19 2. Stabilize process fluids.
20 Sec. 14. NRS 519A.130 is hereby amended to read as follows:
21 519A.130 “Surety” means, but is not limited to, a trust fund, surety bonds that
22 guarantee performance or payment into a trust fund [,] or an account held by or for
23 the benefit of the Division, letters of credit, insurance [, corporate or other

25 approved by the Director of the State Department of Conservation and Natural
26 Resources and used to ensure that reclamation will be completed.
27 Sec. 15. NRS 519A.170 is hereby amended to read as follows:
28 519A.170 All fees collected by the Division pursuant to this chapter,

43 duty to keep the premises, including, without limitation, the access area and the pit
44 lake and its surroundings, safe for entry or use by any other person for participation
45 in any activity, or to give a warning of any hazardous condition, activity or use of
46 the premises to any person entering the premises.
47 5. If a protected person gives permission to another person to access or
48 engage in any activity with respect to any premises specified in subsection 4, the
49 protected person does not thereby extend any assurance that the premises are safe
50 for that activity or any other purpose or assume responsibility for or incur any
51 liability for any injury to any person or property caused by any act of a person to
52 whom the permission is granted. The provisions of this subsection do not confer
53 any liability upon a protected person for any injury to any other person or property,

Senate Amendment No. 630 to Assembly Bill No. 40 First Reprint Page 11
1 whether actual or implied, or create a duty of care or ground of liability for any
2 injury to any person or property.
3 6. Except in the case of an emergency, an operator shall not depart from an
4 approved plan for reclamation without prior written approval from the Division.
5 7. Reclamation activities must be economically and technologically

22 whole or in part, on land administered by a federal agency, [an approved] a federal
23 plan of operations and a surety approved by the federal agency that are consistent
24 with the requirements of this chapter supersede , if wholly conducted on land
25 administered by the federal agency, or substitute, if partly conducted on land
26 administered by the federal agency, the requirements for a permit and bond or
27 other surety otherwise required by this chapter [. If the mining operation or
28 exploration project is conducted on a site which includes both public land and
