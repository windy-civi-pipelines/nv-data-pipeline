Section 12 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law and sections 2-9
governing reclamation to the provisions of sections 10 and 11.
Section 15 of this bill authorizes certain fees collected by the Division that are
used to administer the provisions of existing law relating to reclamation to also be
used to administer the provisions of sections 2-11.
Existing law requires an applicant for a permit to engage in a mining operation
to, amongst other requirements, complete a checklist developed by the Division and
file a plan for reclamation with the application. (NRS 519A.210, 519A.220)
Section 16 of this bill requires that the information requested by the checklist
include a manual for the operation and maintenance of the fluid management
system for the mining operation. Section 17 of this bill requires a plan for
reclamation to provide for the stabilization of process fluids.
Existing law provides that if an exploration project or a mining operation is
conducted on: (1) land administered by a federal agency, an approved federal plan
of operations and surety that are consistent with certain requirements supersede
certain requirements for a permit and bond or other surety; or (2) both public land
and privately owned land, compliance with the approved federal plan of operations
is sufficient if that plan substantially provides for the reclamation and bond or other
surety required by existing law. (NRS 519A.240) Section 18 of this bill provides
that a federal plan of operations and surety approved by a federal agency for an
exploration project or a mining operation supersede, if wholly conducted on land
administered by a federal agency, or substitute, if partly conducted on land
administered by a federal agency, requirements in state law for a permit and bond
or other surety if the applicant: (1) submits to the Division the federal plan of
operations and an estimate of the costs of reclamation; and (2) remedies any
inconsistencies identified by the Division between the federal plan of operations
and the requirements of state law.
Sections 19 and 20 of this bill apply certain disciplinary actions and criminal
penalties to the provisions of sections 2-11.
Existing law requires the governing body of every municipality or district board
of health of a health district to develop a plan to provide for a solid waste
management system which provides for the management and disposal of solid
waste. (NRS 444.510) Existing law defines the term “solid waste management
system” as the entire process of storage, collection, transportation, processing,
recycling and disposal of solid waste. (NRS 444.500) Section 28.3 of this bill
revises the definition of “solid waste management system” to mean the entire
process of storage, collection, transportation, processing, recycling or disposal of
solid waste.
Existing law requires a solid waste management authority to issue permits to
operate disposal sites. (NRS 444.553) Section 28.7 of this bill requires a solid
waste management authority to also issue permits to operate solid waste
management facilities. Section 28.7 also authorizes a solid waste management
authority to take certain actions to determine whether the owner or operator of a
solid waste management facility is in compliance with certain requirements.
Section 32.1 of this bill requires the State Environmental Commission to adopt
regulations concerning standards for the issuance, renewal, modification,
suspension, revocation and denial of, and for the imposition of terms and conditions
for, a permit to construct or operate a solid waste management facility. Sections
32.1-32.4 and 32.8 of this bill make certain provisions of existing law relating to
disposal sites applicable to solid waste management facilities.
Section 22 of this bill defines the term “solid waste management facility” to
mean any place that engages in any activity related to a solid waste management
system. Section 23.5 of this bill authorizes the State Environmental Commission to
adopt regulations establishing activities that are related to a solid waste
-

management system and the places which constitute a solid waste management
facility based on the activities performed at the place.
Existing law requires the owner or operator of a municipal solid waste landfill
to obtain a permit from a solid waste management authority before constructing or
operating the municipal solid waste landfill. The permit must be conditioned upon
all requirements necessary to ensure compliance with certain federal laws
governing solid waste, including financial requirements for the owners and
operators of municipal solid waste landfills. (NRS 444.465, 444.556) Section 30 of
this bill revises certain references to the term “municipal solid waste landfill.”
Section 32.6 of this bill revises a reference to a sanitary landfill with a reference to
a municipal solid waste landfill. Section 32 of this bill prohibits a municipal solid
waste landfill from accepting hazardous waste from a very small quantity
generator.
Section 24 of this bill requires the Commission to adopt regulations prescribing
the requirements for an owner or operator of a municipal solid waste landfill or
solid waste management facility engaged in certain activities to demonstrate
financial responsibility.
Section 29 of this bill provides that certain requirements for a permit relating to
standards of care and financial responsibility may be satisfied by a plan for
reclamation under certain circumstances.
Section 25 of this bill provides that the Division or solid waste management
authority may lien all real and personal property associated with a municipal solid
waste landfill or solid waste management facility of an owner or operator of the
municipal solid waste landfill or solid waste management facility.
Section 26 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law and section 22
governing the collection and disposal of solid waste to the provisions of
sections 22-25.
Existing law establishes provisions governing the disposal of hazardous waste
through the management of hazardous waste, which is defined as the systematic
control of the generation, collection, storage, transportation, processing, treatment,
recovery and disposal of hazardous waste. (NRS 459.400-459.600) Section 39 of
this bill revises: (1) the definition of the management of hazardous waste to mean
the systematic control of the generation, collection, storage, transportation,
recycling, processing, treatment, recovery or disposal of hazardous waste; and as a
result: (2) expands the applicability of these requirements governing hazardous
waste to include recycling as a method for the disposal of hazardous waste and any
systematic control of the generation, collection, storage, transportation, recycling,
processing, treatment, recovery or disposal of hazardous waste.
Sections 36, 40, 44, 46-51, 52 and 53 of this bill remove references to specific
activities constituting the management of hazardous waste. Sections 37.5, 38.5 and
40-41 of this bill revise certain definitions relating to the disposal of hazardous
waste.
Sections 46, 53 and 54 of this bill apply certain existing criminal and civil
penalties and disciplinary actions to the management of hazardous waste.
Section 34 of this bill defines the term “recycling” to mean the processing of
hazardous waste to recover materials or produce a usable product. Section 36
establishes that an additional purpose of the provisions of existing law governing
the disposal of hazardous waste includes conserving resources of material and
energy through the recycling or recovery of hazardous waste.
Section 35 of this bill provides that the Department may lien all real and
personal property associated with a facility for the management of hazardous waste
of the owner, operator or holder of a permit of the facility.
Section 37 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law and section 34
governing the disposal of hazardous waste to the provisions of sections 34 and 35.

Existing law requires the Commission, through the Department, to develop a
program to encourage the minimization of hazardous waste and the recycling or
reuse of hazardous waste. (NRS 459.485) Section 43 of this bill removes the
requirement that the program include the reuse of hazardous waste.
Existing law prohibits a person from constructing, substantially altering or
operating a facility for the treatment, storage or disposal of hazardous waste or
treating, storing or disposing of hazardous waste unless the person has first
obtained a permit from the Department. (NRS 459.515) Section 46 provides that
the person must only obtain a permit if the Commission has required by regulation
that type of facility to obtain a permit. Section 47 requires the Commission to adopt
regulations establishing the types of facilities for the management of hazardous
waste which must obtain a permit.
Existing law requires the Commission to adopt regulations requiring the owner
or operator of any facility for the treatment, storage or disposal of hazardous waste
to show his or her financial responsibility for the undertaking. (NRS 459.525)
Section 48 requires the Commission to adopt regulations establishing the types of
facilities for the management of hazardous waste which must show financial
responsibility.
Existing law provides that certain provisions of existing law authorizing any
authorized representative or employee of the Commission or Department to
conduct certain inspections relating to hazardous substances and authorizing the
Department to issue certain orders relating to hazardous substances do not apply in
a county whose population is less than 55,000 (currently all counties except Clark
County, Washoe County, Lyon County and Carson City). (NRS 459.558) Section
51.5 of this bill removes this exemption.
Existing law prohibits a person from transporting hazardous waste to a facility
that has not been issued a permit to treat, store or dispose of hazardous waste. (NRS
459.590) Section 54.5 of this bill instead prohibits a person from transporting
hazardous waste to a facility that has not been authorized to accept hazardous waste
in accordance with certain regulations adopted by the Commission.

pursuant to subsection 3 owes no duty to keep the premises,
including, without limitation, the access area and the pit lake and its
surroundings, safe for entry or use by any other person for
participation in any activity, or to give a warning of any hazardous
condition, activity or use of the premises to any person entering the
premises.
5. If a protected person gives permission to another person to
access or engage in any activity with respect to any premises
specified in subsection 4, the protected person does not thereby
extend any assurance that the premises are safe for that activity or
any other purpose or assume responsibility for or incur any liability
for any injury to any person or property caused by any act of a
person to whom the permission is granted. The provisions of this
subsection do not confer any liability upon a protected person for
any injury to any other person or property, whether actual or
implied, or create a duty of care or ground of liability for any injury
to any person or property.
6. Except in the case of an emergency, an operator shall not
depart from an approved plan for reclamation without prior written

conducted , in whole or in part, on land administered by a federal
agency, [an approved] a federal plan of operations and a surety
approved by the federal agency that are consistent with the
requirements of this chapter supersede , if wholly conducted on
land administered by the federal agency, or substitute, if partly
conducted on land administered by the federal agency, the
requirements for a permit and bond or other surety otherwise
required by this chapter [. If the mining operation or exploration
project is conducted on a site which includes both public land and
privately owned land, compliance with the federal plan suffices if
that plan substantially provides for the reclamation and bond or
other surety required by this chapter.] if the applicant:
(a) Submits to the Division the federal plan of operations
determined by the federal agency to be administratively complete
and an estimate of the costs of reclamation of the mining
