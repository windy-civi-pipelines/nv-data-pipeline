Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes provisions governing the reclamation of land subject to
2 mining operations or exploration projects. (Chapter 519A of NRS) Section 13 of
3 this bill revises the definition of the term “reclamation” to include actions
4 performed during or after an exploration project or mining operation to stabilize
5 process fluids. Sections 2-9 of this bill define certain terms relating to reclamation.
6 Section 14 of this bill revises the definition of the term “surety” to include an
7 account held by or for the benefit of the Division of Environmental Protection of
8 the State Department of Conservation and Natural Resources.
9 Section 10 of this bill authorizes the Division to issue an order if the Division
10 has reasonable cause to believe that a holder of a permit is violating or is about to
11 violate certain provisions of existing law relating to the reclamation of land.
12 Section 11 of this bill provides that the Division may lien all real and personal
13 property associated with a facility of a holder of a permit for an exploration project
14 or mining operation.
15 Section 12 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law and sections 2-9
16 governing reclamation to the provisions of sections 10 and 11.
17 Section 15 of this bill authorizes certain fees collected by the Division that are
18 used to administer the provisions of existing law relating to reclamation to also be
19 used to administer the provisions of sections 2-11.
20 Existing law requires an applicant for a permit to engage in a mining operation
21 to, amongst other requirements, complete a checklist developed by the Division and
22 file a plan for reclamation with the application. (NRS 519A.210, 519A.220)
23 Section 16 of this bill requires that the information requested by the checklist
24 include a manual for the operation and maintenance of the fluid management
25 system for the mining operation. Section 17 of this bill requires a plan for
26 reclamation to provide for the stabilization of process fluids.
27 Existing law provides that if an exploration project or a mining operation is
28 conducted on: (1) land administered by a federal agency, an approved federal plan
29 of operations and surety that are consistent with certain requirements supersede
30 certain requirements for a permit and bond or other surety; or (2) both public land
31 and privately owned land, compliance with the approved federal plan of operations
32 is sufficient if that plan substantially provides for the reclamation and bond or other
33 surety required by existing law. (NRS 519A.240) Section 18 of this bill provides
34 that a federal plan of operations and surety approved by a federal agency for an
35 exploration project or a mining operation supersede, if wholly conducted on land
36 administered by a federal agency, or substitute, if partly conducted on land
37 administered by a federal agency, requirements in state law for a permit and bond
38 or other surety if the applicant: (1) submits to the Division the federal plan of
39 operations and an estimate of the costs of reclamation; and (2) remedies any
-

– 3 –
40 inconsistencies identified by the Division between the federal plan of operations
41 and the requirements of state law.
42 Sections 19 and 20 of this bill apply certain disciplinary actions and criminal
43 penalties to the provisions of sections 2-11.
44 Existing law requires the governing body of every municipality or district board
45 of health of a health district to develop a plan to provide for a solid waste
46 management system which provides for the management and disposal of solid
47 waste. (NRS 444.510) Existing law defines the term “solid waste management
48 system” as the entire process of storage, collection, transportation, processing,
49 recycling and disposal of solid waste. (NRS 444.500) Section 28.3 of this bill
50 revises the definition of “solid waste management system” to mean the entire
51 process of storage, collection, transportation, processing, recycling or disposal of
52 solid waste.
53 Existing law requires a solid waste management authority to issue permits to
54 operate disposal sites. (NRS 444.553) Section 28.7 of this bill requires a solid
55 waste management authority to also issue permits to operate solid waste
56 management facilities. Section 28.7 also authorizes a solid waste management
57 authority to take certain actions to determine whether the owner or operator of a
58 solid waste management facility is in compliance with certain requirements.
59 Section 32.1 of this bill requires the State Environmental Commission to adopt
60 regulations concerning standards for the issuance, renewal, modification,
61 suspension, revocation and denial of, and for the imposition of terms and conditions
62 for, a permit to construct or operate a solid waste management facility. Sections
63 32.1-32.4 and 32.8 of this bill make certain provisions of existing law relating to
64 disposal sites applicable to solid waste management facilities.
65 Section 22 of this bill defines the term “solid waste management facility” to
66 mean any place that engages in any activity related to a solid waste management
67 system. Section 23.5 of this bill authorizes the State Environmental Commission to
68 adopt regulations establishing activities that are related to a solid waste
69 management system and the places which constitute a solid waste management
70 facility based on the activities performed at the place.
71 Existing law requires the owner or operator of a municipal solid waste landfill
72 to obtain a permit from a solid waste management authority before constructing or
73 operating the municipal solid waste landfill. The permit must be conditioned upon
74 all requirements necessary to ensure compliance with certain federal laws
75 governing solid waste, including financial requirements for the owners and
76 operators of municipal solid waste landfills. (NRS 444.465, 444.556) Section 30 of
77 this bill revises certain references to the term “municipal solid waste landfill.”
78 Section 32.6 of this bill revises a reference to a sanitary landfill with a reference to
79 a municipal solid waste landfill. Section 32 of this bill prohibits a municipal solid
80 waste landfill from accepting hazardous waste from a very small quantity
81 generator.
82 Section 24 of this bill requires the Commission to adopt regulations prescribing
83 the requirements for an owner or operator of a municipal solid waste landfill or
84 solid waste management facility engaged in certain activities to demonstrate
85 financial responsibility.
86 Section 29 of this bill provides that certain requirements for a permit relating to
87 standards of care and financial responsibility may be satisfied by a plan for
88 reclamation under certain circumstances.
89 Section 25 of this bill provides that the Division or solid waste management
90 authority may lien all real and personal property associated with a municipal solid
91 waste landfill or solid waste management facility of an owner or operator of the
92 municipal solid waste landfill or solid waste management facility.
93 Section 26 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law and section 22
94 governing the collection and disposal of solid waste to the provisions of
95 sections 22-25.

*AB40_R2*

– 4 –
96 Existing law establishes provisions governing the disposal of hazardous waste
97 through the management of hazardous waste, which is defined as the systematic
98 control of the generation, collection, storage, transportation, processing, treatment,
99 recovery and disposal of hazardous waste. (NRS 459.400-459.600) Section 39 of
100 this bill revises: (1) the definition of the management of hazardous waste to mean
101 the systematic control of the generation, collection, storage, transportation,
102 recycling, processing, treatment, recovery or disposal of hazardous waste; and as a
103 result: (2) expands the applicability of these requirements governing hazardous
104 waste to include recycling as a method for the disposal of hazardous waste and any
105 systematic control of the generation, collection, storage, transportation, recycling,
106 processing, treatment, recovery or disposal of hazardous waste.
107 Sections 36, 40, 44, 46-51, 52 and 53 of this bill remove references to specific
108 activities constituting the management of hazardous waste. Sections 37.5, 38.5 and
109 40-41 of this bill revise certain definitions relating to the disposal of hazardous
110 waste.
111 Sections 46, 53 and 54 of this bill apply certain existing criminal and civil
112 penalties and disciplinary actions to the management of hazardous waste.
113 Section 34 of this bill defines the term “recycling” to mean the processing of
114 hazardous waste to recover materials or produce a usable product. Section 36
115 establishes that an additional purpose of the provisions of existing law governing
116 the disposal of hazardous waste includes conserving resources of material and
117 energy through the recycling or recovery of hazardous waste.
118 Section 35 of this bill provides that the Department may lien all real and
119 personal property associated with a facility for the management of hazardous waste
120 of the owner, operator or holder of a permit of the facility.
121 Section 37 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law and section 34
122 governing the disposal of hazardous waste to the provisions of sections 34 and 35.
123 Existing law requires the Commission, through the Department, to develop a
124 program to encourage the minimization of hazardous waste and the recycling or
125 reuse of hazardous waste. (NRS 459.485) Section 43 of this bill removes the
126 requirement that the program include the reuse of hazardous waste.
127 Existing law prohibits a person from constructing, substantially altering or
128 operating a facility for the treatment, storage or disposal of hazardous waste or
129 treating, storing or disposing of hazardous waste unless the person has first
130 obtained a permit from the Department. (NRS 459.515) Section 46 provides that
131 the person must only obtain a permit if the Commission has required by regulation
132 that type of facility to obtain a permit. Section 47 requires the Commission to adopt
133 regulations establishing the types of facilities for the management of hazardous
134 waste which must obtain a permit.
135 Existing law requires the Commission to adopt regulations requiring the owner
136 or operator of any facility for the treatment, storage or disposal of hazardous waste
137 to show his or her financial responsibility for the undertaking. (NRS 459.525)
138 Section 48 requires the Commission to adopt regulations establishing the types of
139 facilities for the management of hazardous waste which must show financial
140 responsibility.
141 Existing law provides that certain provisions of existing law authorizing any
142 authorized representative or employee of the Commission or Department to
143 conduct certain inspections relating to hazardous substances and authorizing the
144 Department to issue certain orders relating to hazardous substances do not apply in
145 a county whose population is less than 55,000 (currently all counties except Clark
146 County, Washoe County, Lyon County and Carson City). (NRS 459.558) Section
147 51.5 of this bill removes this exemption.
148 Existing law prohibits a person from transporting hazardous waste to a facility
149 that has not been issued a permit to treat, store or dispose of hazardous waste. (NRS
150 459.590) Section 54.5 of this bill instead prohibits a person from transporting
