Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes provisions governing the reclamation of land subject to
2 mining operations or exploration projects. (Chapter 519A of NRS) Section 13 of
3 this bill revises the definition of the term “reclamation” to include actions
4 performed during or after an exploration project or mining operation to stabilize
5 process fluids. Sections 2-9 of this bill define certain terms relating to reclamation.
6 Section 14 of this bill revises the definition of the term “surety” to include an
7 account held by or for the benefit of the Division of Environmental Protection of
8 the State Department of Conservation and Natural Resources.
9 Section 10 of this bill authorizes the Division to issue an order if the Division
10 has reasonable cause to believe that a holder of a permit is violating or is about to
11 violate certain provisions of existing law relating to the reclamation of land.
12 Section 11 of this bill provides that the Division may lien all real and personal
13 property associated with a facility of a holder of a permit for an exploration project
14 or mining operation.
15 Section 12 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law and sections 2-9
16 governing reclamation to the provisions of sections 10 and 11.
17 Section 15 of this bill authorizes certain fees collected by the Division that are
18 used to administer the provisions of existing law relating to reclamation to also be
19 used to administer the provisions of sections 2-11.
20 Existing law requires an applicant for a permit to engage in a mining operation
21 to, amongst other requirements, complete a checklist developed by the Division and
22 file a plan for reclamation with the application. (NRS 519A.210, 519A.220)
23 Section 16 of this bill requires that the information requested by the checklist
24 include a manual for the operation and maintenance of the fluid management
25 system for the mining operation. Section 17 of this bill requires a plan for
26 reclamation to provide for the stabilization of process fluids.
27 Existing law provides that if an exploration project or a mining operation is
28 conducted on: (1) land administered by a federal agency, an approved federal plan
29 of operations and surety that are consistent with certain requirements supersede
30 certain requirements for a permit and bond or other surety; or (2) both public land
31 and privately owned land, compliance with the approved federal plan of operations
32 is sufficient if that plan substantially provides for the reclamation and bond or other
33 surety required by existing law. (NRS 519A.240) Section 18 of this bill provides
34 that a federal plan of operations and surety approved by a federal agency for an
35 exploration project or a mining operation supersede, if wholly conducted on land
36 administered by a federal agency, or substitute, if partly conducted on land
37 administered by a federal agency, requirements in state law for a permit and bond
38 or other surety if the applicant: (1) submits to the Division the federal plan of
39 operations and an estimate of the costs of reclamation; and (2) remedies any
-

40 inconsistencies identified by the Division between the federal plan of operations
41 and the requirements of state law.
42 Sections 19 and 20 of this bill apply certain disciplinary actions and criminal
43 penalties to the provisions of sections 2-11.
44 Existing law requires the governing body of every municipality or district board
45 of health of a health district to develop a plan to provide for a solid waste
46 management system which provides for the management and disposal of solid
47 waste. (NRS 444.510) Existing law defines the term “solid waste management
48 system” as the entire process of storage, collection, transportation, processing,
49 recycling and disposal of solid waste. (NRS 444.500) Section 28.3 of this bill
50 revises the definition of “solid waste management system” to mean the entire
51 process of storage, collection, transportation, processing, recycling or disposal of
52 solid waste.
53 Existing law requires a solid waste management authority to issue permits to
54 operate disposal sites. (NRS 444.553) Section 28.7 of this bill requires a solid
55 waste management authority to also issue permits to operate solid waste
56 management facilities. Section 32.1 of this bill requires the State Environmental
57 Commission to adopt regulations concerning standards for the issuance, renewal,
58 modification, suspension, revocation and denial of, and for the imposition of terms
59 and conditions for, a permit to construct or operate a solid waste management
60 facility. Sections 32.1-32.4 and 32.8 of this bill make certain provisions of existing
61 law relating to disposal sites applicable to solid waste management facilities.
62 Section 22 of this bill defines the term “solid waste management facility” to
63 mean any place that engages in any activity related to a solid waste management
64 system. Section 23.5 of this bill authorizes the State Environmental Commission to
65 adopt regulations establishing activities that are related to a solid waste
66 management system and the places which constitute a solid waste management
67 facility based on the activities performed at the place.
68 Existing law requires the owner or operator of a municipal solid waste landfill
69 to obtain a permit from a solid waste management authority before constructing or
70 operating the municipal solid waste landfill. The permit must be conditioned upon
71 all requirements necessary to ensure compliance with certain federal laws
72 governing solid waste, including financial requirements for the owners and
73 operators of municipal solid waste landfills. (NRS 444.465, 444.556) Section 30 of
74 this bill revises certain references to the term “municipal solid waste landfill.”
75 Section 32.6 of this bill revises a reference to a sanitary landfill with a reference to
76 a municipal solid waste landfill. Section 32 of this bill prohibits a municipal solid
77 waste landfill from accepting hazardous waste from a very small quantity
78 generator.
79 Section 24 of this bill requires the Commission to adopt regulations prescribing
80 the requirements for an owner or operator of a municipal solid waste landfill or
81 solid waste management facility to demonstrate financial responsibility.
82 Section 29 of this bill provides that certain requirements for a permit relating to
83 standards of care and financial responsibility may be satisfied by a plan for
84 reclamation under certain circumstances.
85 Section 25 of this bill provides that the Division or solid waste management
86 authority may lien all real and personal property associated with a municipal solid
87 waste landfill or solid waste management facility of an owner or operator of the
88 municipal solid waste landfill or solid waste management facility.
89 Section 26 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law and section 22
90 governing the collection and disposal of solid waste to the provisions of sections
91 22-25.
92 Existing law establishes provisions governing the disposal of hazardous waste
93 through the management of hazardous waste, which is defined as the systematic
94 control of the generation, collection, storage, transportation, processing, treatment,
95 recovery and disposal of hazardous waste. (NRS 459.400-459.600) Section 39 of
-
*AB40_R1*
– 4 –
96 this bill revises: (1) the definition of the management of hazardous waste to mean
97 the systematic control of the generation, collection, storage, transportation,
98 recycling, processing, treatment, recovery or disposal of hazardous waste; and as a
99 result: (2) expands the applicability of these requirements governing hazardous
100 waste to include recycling as a method for the disposal of hazardous waste and any
101 systematic control of the generation, collection, storage, transportation, recycling,
102 processing, treatment, recovery or disposal of hazardous waste.
103 Sections 36, 40, 44, 46-51, 52 and 53 of this bill remove references to specific
104 activities constituting the management of hazardous waste. Sections 37.5, 38.5 and
105 40-41 of this bill revise certain definitions relating to the disposal of hazardous
106 waste.
107 Sections 46, 53 and 54 of this bill apply certain existing criminal and civil
108 penalties and disciplinary actions to the management of hazardous waste.
109 Section 34 of this bill defines the term “recycling” to mean the processing of
110 hazardous waste to recover materials or produce a usable product. Section 36
111 establishes that an additional purpose of the provisions of existing law governing
112 the disposal of hazardous waste includes conserving resources of material and
113 energy through the recycling or recovery of hazardous waste.
114 Section 35 of this bill provides that the Department may lien all real and
115 personal property associated with a facility for the management of hazardous waste
116 of the owner, operator or holder of a permit of the facility.
117 Section 37 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law and section 34
118 governing the disposal of hazardous waste to the provisions of sections 34 and 35.
119 Existing law requires the Commission, through the Department, to develop a
120 program to encourage the minimization of hazardous waste and the recycling or
121 reuse of hazardous waste. (NRS 459.485) Section 43 of this bill removes the
122 requirement that the program include the reuse of hazardous waste.
123 Existing law prohibits a person from constructing, substantially altering or
124 operating a facility for the treatment, storage or disposal of hazardous waste or
125 treating, storing or disposing of hazardous waste unless the person has first
126 obtained a permit from the Department. (NRS 459.515) Section 46 provides that
127 the person must only obtain a permit if the Commission has required by regulation
128 that type of facility to obtain a permit. Section 47 requires the Commission to adopt
129 regulations establishing the types of facilities for the management of hazardous
130 waste which must obtain a permit.
131 Existing law requires the Commission to adopt regulations requiring the owner
132 or operator of any facility for the treatment, storage or disposal of hazardous waste
133 to show his or her financial responsibility for the undertaking. (NRS 459.525)
134 Section 48 requires the Commission to adopt regulations establishing the types of
135 facilities for the management of hazardous waste which must show financial
136 responsibility.
137 Existing law provides that certain provisions of existing law authorizing any
138 authorized representative or employee of the Commission or Department to
139 conduct certain inspections relating to hazardous substances and authorizing the
140 Department to issue certain orders relating to hazardous substances do not apply in
141 a county whose population is less than 55,000 (currently all counties except Clark
142 County, Washoe County, Lyon County and Carson City). (NRS 459.558) Section
143 51.5 of this bill removes this exemption.
144 Existing law prohibits a person from transporting hazardous waste to a facility
145 that has not been issued a permit to treat, store or dispose of hazardous waste. (NRS
146 459.590) Section 54.5 of this bill instead prohibits a person from transporting
147 hazardous waste to a facility that has not been authorized to accept hazardous waste
148 in accordance with certain regulations adopted by the Commission.

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes provisions governing the reclamation of land subject to
2 mining operations or exploration projects. (Chapter 519A of NRS) Section 13 of
3 this bill revises the definition of the term “reclamation” to include actions
4 performed during or after an exploration project or mining operation to stabilize
5 process fluids. Sections 2-9 of this bill define certain terms relating to reclamation.
6 Section 14 of this bill revises the definition of the term “surety” to include an
7 account held by or for the benefit of the Division of Environmental Protection of
8 the State Department of Conservation and Natural Resources.
9 Section 10 of this bill authorizes the Division to issue an order if the Division
10 has reasonable cause to believe that a holder of a permit is violating or is about to
11 violate certain provisions of existing law relating to the reclamation of land.
12 Section 11 of this bill provides that the Division may lien all real and personal
13 property associated with a facility of a holder of a permit for an exploration project
14 or mining operation.
15 Section 12 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law and sections 2-9
16 governing reclamation to the provisions of sections 10 and 11.
17 Section 15 of this bill authorizes certain fees collected by the Division that are
18 used to administer the provisions of existing law relating to reclamation to also be
19 used to administer the provisions of sections 2-11.
20 Existing law requires an applicant for a permit to engage in a mining operation
21 to, amongst other requirements, complete a checklist developed by the Division and
22 file a plan for reclamation with the application. (NRS 519A.210, 519A.220)
23 Section 16 of this bill requires that the information requested by the checklist
24 include a manual for the operation and maintenance of the fluid management
25 system for the mining operation. Section 17 of this bill requires a plan for
26 reclamation to provide for the stabilization of process fluids.
27 Existing law provides that if an exploration project or a mining operation is
28 conducted on: (1) land administered by a federal agency, an approved federal plan
29 of operations and surety that are consistent with certain requirements supersede
30 certain requirements for a permit and bond or other surety; or (2) both public land
31 and privately owned land, compliance with the approved federal plan of operations
32 is sufficient if that plan substantially provides for the reclamation and bond or other
33 surety required by existing law. (NRS 519A.240) Section 18 of this bill provides
34 that a federal plan of operations and surety approved by a federal agency for an
35 exploration project or a mining operation supersede, if wholly conducted on land
36 administered by a federal agency, or substitute, if partly conducted on land
37 administered by a federal agency, requirements in state law for a permit and bond
38 or other surety if the applicant: (1) submits to the Division the federal plan of
39 operations and an estimate of the costs of reclamation; and (2) remedies any
-

– 3 –
40 inconsistencies identified by the Division between the federal plan of operations
41 and the requirements of state law.
42 Sections 19 and 20 of this bill apply certain disciplinary actions and criminal
43 penalties to the provisions of sections 2-11.
44 Existing law requires the governing body of every municipality or district board
45 of health of a health district to develop a plan to provide for a solid waste
46 management system which provides for the management and disposal of solid
47 waste. (NRS 444.510) Existing law defines the term “solid waste management
48 system” as the entire process of storage, collection, transportation, processing,
49 recycling and disposal of solid waste. (NRS 444.500) Section 28.3 of this bill
50 revises the definition of “solid waste management system” to mean the entire
51 process of storage, collection, transportation, processing, recycling or disposal of
52 solid waste.
53 Existing law requires a solid waste management authority to issue permits to
54 operate disposal sites. (NRS 444.553) Section 28.7 of this bill requires a solid
55 waste management authority to also issue permits to operate solid waste
56 management facilities. Section 32.1 of this bill requires the State Environmental
57 Commission to adopt regulations concerning standards for the issuance, renewal,
58 modification, suspension, revocation and denial of, and for the imposition of terms
59 and conditions for, a permit to construct or operate a solid waste management
60 facility. Sections 32.1-32.4 and 32.8 of this bill make certain provisions of existing
61 law relating to disposal sites applicable to solid waste management facilities.
62 Section 22 of this bill defines the term “solid waste management facility” to
63 mean any place that engages in any activity related to a solid waste management
64 system. Section 23.5 of this bill authorizes the State Environmental Commission to
65 adopt regulations establishing activities that are related to a solid waste
66 management system and the places which constitute a solid waste management
67 facility based on the activities performed at the place.
68 Existing law requires the owner or operator of a municipal solid waste landfill
69 to obtain a permit from a solid waste management authority before constructing or
70 operating the municipal solid waste landfill. The permit must be conditioned upon
71 all requirements necessary to ensure compliance with certain federal laws
72 governing solid waste, including financial requirements for the owners and
73 operators of municipal solid waste landfills. (NRS 444.465, 444.556) Section 30 of
74 this bill revises certain references to the term “municipal solid waste landfill.”
75 Section 32.6 of this bill revises a reference to a sanitary landfill with a reference to
76 a municipal solid waste landfill. Section 32 of this bill prohibits a municipal solid
77 waste landfill from accepting hazardous waste from a very small quantity
78 generator.
79 Section 24 of this bill requires the Commission to adopt regulations prescribing
80 the requirements for an owner or operator of a municipal solid waste landfill or
81 solid waste management facility to demonstrate financial responsibility.
82 Section 29 of this bill provides that certain requirements for a permit relating to
83 standards of care and financial responsibility may be satisfied by a plan for
84 reclamation under certain circumstances.
85 Section 25 of this bill provides that the Division or solid waste management
86 authority may lien all real and personal property associated with a municipal solid
87 waste landfill or solid waste management facility of an owner or operator of the
88 municipal solid waste landfill or solid waste management facility.
89 Section 26 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law and section 22
90 governing the collection and disposal of solid waste to the provisions of sections
91 22-25.
92 Existing law establishes provisions governing the disposal of hazardous waste
93 through the management of hazardous waste, which is defined as the systematic
94 control of the generation, collection, storage, transportation, processing, treatment,
95 recovery and disposal of hazardous waste. (NRS 459.400-459.600) Section 39 of
-
*AB40_R1*

– 4 –
96 this bill revises: (1) the definition of the management of hazardous waste to mean
97 the systematic control of the generation, collection, storage, transportation,
98 recycling, processing, treatment, recovery or disposal of hazardous waste; and as a
99 result: (2) expands the applicability of these requirements governing hazardous
100 waste to include recycling as a method for the disposal of hazardous waste and any
101 systematic control of the generation, collection, storage, transportation, recycling,
102 processing, treatment, recovery or disposal of hazardous waste.
103 Sections 36, 40, 44, 46-51, 52 and 53 of this bill remove references to specific
104 activities constituting the management of hazardous waste. Sections 37.5, 38.5 and
105 40-41 of this bill revise certain definitions relating to the disposal of hazardous
106 waste.
107 Sections 46, 53 and 54 of this bill apply certain existing criminal and civil
108 penalties and disciplinary actions to the management of hazardous waste.
109 Section 34 of this bill defines the term “recycling” to mean the processing of
110 hazardous waste to recover materials or produce a usable product. Section 36
111 establishes that an additional purpose of the provisions of existing law governing
112 the disposal of hazardous waste includes conserving resources of material and
113 energy through the recycling or recovery of hazardous waste.
114 Section 35 of this bill provides that the Department may lien all real and
115 personal property associated with a facility for the management of hazardous waste
116 of the owner, operator or holder of a permit of the facility.
117 Section 37 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law and section 34
118 governing the disposal of hazardous waste to the provisions of sections 34 and 35.
119 Existing law requires the Commission, through the Department, to develop a
120 program to encourage the minimization of hazardous waste and the recycling or
121 reuse of hazardous waste. (NRS 459.485) Section 43 of this bill removes the
122 requirement that the program include the reuse of hazardous waste.
123 Existing law prohibits a person from constructing, substantially altering or
124 operating a facility for the treatment, storage or disposal of hazardous waste or
125 treating, storing or disposing of hazardous waste unless the person has first
126 obtained a permit from the Department. (NRS 459.515) Section 46 provides that
127 the person must only obtain a permit if the Commission has required by regulation
128 that type of facility to obtain a permit. Section 47 requires the Commission to adopt
129 regulations establishing the types of facilities for the management of hazardous
130 waste which must obtain a permit.
131 Existing law requires the Commission to adopt regulations requiring the owner
132 or operator of any facility for the treatment, storage or disposal of hazardous waste
133 to show his or her financial responsibility for the undertaking. (NRS 459.525)
134 Section 48 requires the Commission to adopt regulations establishing the types of
135 facilities for the management of hazardous waste which must show financial
136 responsibility.
137 Existing law provides that certain provisions of existing law authorizing any
138 authorized representative or employee of the Commission or Department to
139 conduct certain inspections relating to hazardous substances and authorizing the
140 Department to issue certain orders relating to hazardous substances do not apply in
141 a county whose population is less than 55,000 (currently all counties except Clark
142 County, Washoe County, Lyon County and Carson City). (NRS 459.558) Section
143 51.5 of this bill removes this exemption.
144 Existing law prohibits a person from transporting hazardous waste to a facility
145 that has not been issued a permit to treat, store or dispose of hazardous waste. (NRS
146 459.590) Section 54.5 of this bill instead prohibits a person from transporting
147 hazardous waste to a facility that has not been authorized to accept hazardous waste
148 in accordance with certain regulations adopted by the Commission.
