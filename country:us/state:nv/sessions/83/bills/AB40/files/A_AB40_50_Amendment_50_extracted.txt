Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes provisions governing the reclamation of land subject to mining
2 operations or exploration projects. (Chapter 519A of NRS) Section 13 of this bill revises the
3 definition of the term “reclamation” to include actions performed during or after an
4 exploration project or mining operation to stabilize process fluids. Sections 2-9 of this bill
5 define certain terms relating to reclamation. Section 14 of this bill revises the definition of the
6 term “surety” to include an account held by or for the benefit of the Division of
7 Environmental Protection of the State Department of Conservation and Natural Resources.
8 Section 10 of this bill authorizes the Division to issue [a summary] an order if the
9 Division has reasonable cause to believe that a [person] holder of a permit is violating or is
10 about to violate certain provisions of existing law relating to the reclamation of land.
11 Section 11 of this bill provides that [, upon the issuance of a notice of noncompliance or a
12 summary order to a person holding a permit for an exploration project or mining operation,]
13 the Division [has a] may lien [on] all real and personal property associated with a facility of
14 [the person.] a holder of a permit for an exploration project or mining operation.
15 Section 12 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law and sections 2-9 governing
16 reclamation to the provisions of sections 10 and 11.
17 Section 15 of this bill authorizes certain fees collected by the Division that are used to
18 administer the provisions of existing law relating to reclamation to also be used to administer
19 the provisions of sections 2-11.
20 Existing law requires an applicant for a permit to engage in a mining operation to,
21 amongst other requirements, complete a checklist developed by the Division and file a plan
22 for reclamation with the application. (NRS 519A.210, 519A.220) Section 16 of this bill
23 requires that the information requested by the checklist include a manual for the operation and
24 maintenance of the fluid management system for the mining operation. Section 17 of this bill
25 requires a plan for reclamation to provide for the stabilization of process fluids.
26 Existing law provides that if an exploration project or a mining operation [are] is
27 conducted on: (1) land administered by a federal agency, an approved federal plan of
28 operations and surety that are consistent with certain requirements [supersedes] supersede
29 certain requirements for a permit and bond or other surety; or (2) both public land and
30 privately owned land, compliance with the approved federal plan of operations is sufficient if
31 that plan substantially provides for the reclamation and bond or other surety required by
32 existing law. (NRS 519A.240) Section 18 of this bill [requires the Division to approve: (1)
33 any parts of] provides that a federal plan of operations and surety approved by a federal
34 agency for an exploration project or a mining operation supersede, if wholly conducted on
35 land administered by a federal agency , [that include the stabilization of process fluids; and (2)
36 a federal plan of operations and surety approved by a federal agency for an exploration project
37 or a mining operation] or substitute, if partly conducted on [a site that includes both public
38 and privately owned] land [.] administered by a federal agency, requirements in state law
39 for a permit and bond or other surety if the applicant: (1) submits to the Division the
40 federal plan of operations and an estimate of the costs of reclamation; and (2) remedies
41 any inconsistencies identified by the Division between the federal plan of operations and
42 the requirements of state law.
43 Sections 19 and 20 of this bill apply certain disciplinary actions and criminal penalties to
44 the provisions of sections 2-11.
45 Existing law requires the governing body of every municipality or district board of
46 health of a health district to develop a plan to provide for a solid waste management
47 system which provides for the management and disposal of solid waste. (NRS 444.510)
48 Existing law defines the term “solid waste management system” as the entire process of
49 storage, collection, transportation, processing, recycling and disposal of solid waste.
50 (NRS 444.500) Section 28.3 of this bill revises the definition of “solid waste management
51 system” to mean the entire process of storage, collection, transportation, processing,
52 recycling or disposal of solid waste.
Assembly Amendment No. 50 to Assembly Bill No. 40 Page 5
53 Existing law requires a solid waste management authority to issue permits to
54 operate disposal sites. (NRS 444.553) Section 28.7 of this bill requires a solid waste
55 management authority to also issue permits to operate solid waste management facilities.
56 Section 32.1 of this bill requires the State Environmental Commission to adopt
57 regulations concerning standards for the issuance, renewal, modification, suspension,
58 revocation and denial of, and for the imposition of terms and conditions for, a permit to
59 construct or operate a solid waste management facility. Sections 32.1-32.4 and 32.8 of
60 this bill make certain provisions of existing law relating to disposal sites applicable to
61 solid waste management facilities.
62 Section 22 of this bill defines the term “solid waste management facility” to mean
63 any place that engages in any activity related to a solid waste management system.
64 Section 23.5 of this bill authorizes the State Environmental Commission to adopt
65 regulations establishing activities that are related to a solid waste management system
66 and the places which constitute a solid waste management facility based on the activities
67 performed at the place.
68 Existing law requires the owner or operator of a municipal solid waste landfill to obtain a
69 permit from a solid waste management authority before constructing or operating the
70 municipal solid waste landfill. The permit must be conditioned upon all requirements
71 necessary to ensure compliance with certain federal laws governing solid waste, including
72 financial requirements for the owners and operators of municipal solid waste landfills. (NRS
73 444.465, 444.556) Section [28 of this bill revises the definition of the term “municipal solid
74 waste landfill” to exclude a landfill that receives waste from a very small quantity generator.
75 Section 23 of this bill defines the term “very small quantity generator.”
76 Section 29 of this bill requires the owner or operator of a solid waste management facility
77 to also obtain a permit from a solid waste management authority. Sections 30-32] 30 of this
78 bill [apply certain other requirements in existing law governing municipal] revises certain
79 references to the term “municipal solid waste [landfills to solid waste management
80 facilities.
81 Section 22] landfill.” Section 32.6 of this bill [defines the term “solid waste management
82 facility” to mean a facility or location that engages in any activity related to a solid waste
83 management system. Section 27 of this bill revises the definition of the term “disposal site” to
84 include a solid waste management facility.] revises a reference to a sanitary landfill with a
85 reference to a municipal solid waste landfill. Section 32 of this bill prohibits a municipal
86 solid waste landfill from accepting hazardous waste from a very small quantity
87 generator.
88 Section 24 of this bill requires the [State Environmental] Commission to adopt
89 regulations prescribing the requirements for an owner or operator of a municipal solid waste
90 landfill or solid waste management facility to demonstrate financial responsibility.
91 Section 29 [also] of this bill provides that certain requirements for a permit relating to
92 standards of care and financial responsibility may be satisfied by a plan for reclamation under
93 certain circumstances.
94 Section 25 of this bill provides that [, upon the issuance of an order or action taken by a
95 solid waste management authority under existing law,] the Division or solid waste
96 management authority [has a] may lien [on] all real and personal property associated with a
97 municipal solid waste landfill or solid waste management facility of [the person who is the
98 subject of the order or action.] an owner or operator of the municipal solid waste landfill
99 or solid waste management facility.
100 Section 26 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law and [sections] section 22
101 [and 23] governing the collection and disposal of solid waste to the provisions of sections 22-
102 25.
103 Existing law establishes provisions governing the disposal of hazardous waste through the
104 management of hazardous waste, which is defined as the systematic control of the
105 generation, collection, storage, transportation, processing, treatment, recovery and disposal of
106 hazardous waste. (NRS 459.400-459.600) [Sections 36, 38-45 and 47-52] Section 39 of this
107 bill [expand] revises: (1) the definition of the management of hazardous waste to mean
108 the systematic control of the generation, collection, storage, transportation, recycling,
109 processing, treatment, recovery or disposal of hazardous waste; and as a result: (2)
110 expands the applicability of these requirements governing hazardous waste to include
111 recycling as a method for the disposal of hazardous waste [.] and any systematic control of
Assembly Amendment No. 50 to Assembly Bill No. 40 Page 6
112 the generation, collection, storage, transportation, recycling, processing, treatment,
113 recovery or disposal of hazardous waste.
114 Sections 36, 40, 44, 46-51, 52 and 53 of this bill remove references to specific
115 activities constituting the management of hazardous waste. Sections 37.5, 38.5 and 40-41
116 of this bill revise certain definitions relating to the disposal of hazardous waste.
117 Sections 46 [and 53-55] , 53 and 54 of this bill apply certain existing criminal and civil
118 penalties and disciplinary actions to the [recycling] management of hazardous waste. [As a
119 result of the inclusion of recycling, certain existing fees and reimbursements relating to the
120 management of hazardous waste also apply to the recycling of hazardous waste. (NRS
121 459.500, 459.512, 459.537, 459.548, 459.634)]
122 Section 34 of this bill defines the term “recycling” to mean the [process] processing of
123 [using] hazardous waste to recover materials or produce a usable product. Section 36
124 establishes that an additional purpose of the provisions of existing law governing the
125 disposal of hazardous waste includes conserving resources of material and energy
126 through the recycling or recovery of hazardous waste.
127 Section 35 of this bill provides that [upon the issuance of an order under certain
128 provisions of existing law,] the Department [has a] may lien [on] all real and personal
129 property associated with a facility for the management of hazardous waste of the [person
130 who is the subject of the order.] owner, operator or holder of a permit of the facility.
131 Section 37 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law and section 34 governing the
132 disposal of hazardous waste to the provisions of sections 34 and 35.
133 Existing law requires the Commission, through the Department, to develop a
134 program to encourage the minimization of hazardous waste and the recycling or reuse of
135 hazardous waste. (NRS 459.485) Section 43 of this bill removes the requirement that the
136 program include the reuse of hazardous waste.
137 Existing law prohibits a person from constructing, substantially altering or
138 operating a facility for the treatment, storage or disposal of hazardous waste or treating,
139 storing or disposing of hazardous waste unless the person has first obtained a permit
140 from the Department. (NRS 459.515) Section 46 provides that the person must only
141 obtain a permit if the Commission has required by regulation that type of facility to
142 obtain a permit. Section 47 requires the Commission to adopt regulations establishing
143 the types of facilities for the management of hazardous waste which must obtain a
144 permit.
145 Existing law requires the Commission to adopt regulations requiring the owner or
146 operator of any facility for the treatment, storage or disposal of hazardous waste to show
147 his or her financial responsibility for the undertaking. (NRS 459.525) Section 48 requires
148 the Commission to adopt regulations establishing the types of facilities for the
149 management of hazardous waste which must show financial responsibility.
150 Existing law provides that certain provisions of existing law authorizing any
151 authorized representative or employee of the Commission or Department to conduct
152 certain inspections relating to hazardous substances and authorizing the Department to
153 issue certain orders relating to hazardous substances do not apply in a county whose
154 population is less than 55,000 (currently all counties except Clark County, Washoe
155 County, Lyon County and Carson City). (NRS 459.558) Section 51.5 of this bill removes
156 this exemption.
157 Existing law prohibits a person from transporting hazardous waste to a facility that
158 has not been issued a permit to treat, store or dispose of hazardous waste. (NRS 459.590)
159 Section 54.5 of this bill instead prohibits a person from transporting hazardous waste to
160 a facility that has not been authorized to accept hazardous waste in accordance with
161 certain regulations adopted by the Commission.

41 liability for any injury to any person or property caused by any act of a person to
42 whom the permission is granted. The provisions of this subsection do not confer
43 any liability upon a protected person for any injury to any other person or property,
44 whether actual or implied, or create a duty of care or ground of liability for any

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes provisions governing the reclamation of land subject to mining
2 operations or exploration projects. (Chapter 519A of NRS) Section 13 of this bill revises the
3 definition of the term “reclamation” to include actions performed during or after an
4 exploration project or mining operation to stabilize process fluids. Sections 2-9 of this bill
5 define certain terms relating to reclamation. Section 14 of this bill revises the definition of the
6 term “surety” to include an account held by or for the benefit of the Division of
7 Environmental Protection of the State Department of Conservation and Natural Resources.
8 Section 10 of this bill authorizes the Division to issue [a summary] an order if the
9 Division has reasonable cause to believe that a [person] holder of a permit is violating or is
10 about to violate certain provisions of existing law relating to the reclamation of land.
11 Section 11 of this bill provides that [, upon the issuance of a notice of noncompliance or a
12 summary order to a person holding a permit for an exploration project or mining operation,]
13 the Division [has a] may lien [on] all real and personal property associated with a facility of
14 [the person.] a holder of a permit for an exploration project or mining operation.
15 Section 12 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law and sections 2-9 governing
16 reclamation to the provisions of sections 10 and 11.
17 Section 15 of this bill authorizes certain fees collected by the Division that are used to
18 administer the provisions of existing law relating to reclamation to also be used to administer
19 the provisions of sections 2-11.
20 Existing law requires an applicant for a permit to engage in a mining operation to,
21 amongst other requirements, complete a checklist developed by the Division and file a plan
22 for reclamation with the application. (NRS 519A.210, 519A.220) Section 16 of this bill
23 requires that the information requested by the checklist include a manual for the operation and
24 maintenance of the fluid management system for the mining operation. Section 17 of this bill
25 requires a plan for reclamation to provide for the stabilization of process fluids.
26 Existing law provides that if an exploration project or a mining operation [are] is
27 conducted on: (1) land administered by a federal agency, an approved federal plan of
28 operations and surety that are consistent with certain requirements [supersedes] supersede
29 certain requirements for a permit and bond or other surety; or (2) both public land and
30 privately owned land, compliance with the approved federal plan of operations is sufficient if
31 that plan substantially provides for the reclamation and bond or other surety required by
32 existing law. (NRS 519A.240) Section 18 of this bill [requires the Division to approve: (1)
33 any parts of] provides that a federal plan of operations and surety approved by a federal
34 agency for an exploration project or a mining operation supersede, if wholly conducted on
35 land administered by a federal agency , [that include the stabilization of process fluids; and (2)
36 a federal plan of operations and surety approved by a federal agency for an exploration project
37 or a mining operation] or substitute, if partly conducted on [a site that includes both public
38 and privately owned] land [.] administered by a federal agency, requirements in state law
39 for a permit and bond or other surety if the applicant: (1) submits to the Division the
40 federal plan of operations and an estimate of the costs of reclamation; and (2) remedies
41 any inconsistencies identified by the Division between the federal plan of operations and
42 the requirements of state law.
43 Sections 19 and 20 of this bill apply certain disciplinary actions and criminal penalties to
44 the provisions of sections 2-11.
45 Existing law requires the governing body of every municipality or district board of
46 health of a health district to develop a plan to provide for a solid waste management
47 system which provides for the management and disposal of solid waste. (NRS 444.510)
48 Existing law defines the term “solid waste management system” as the entire process of
49 storage, collection, transportation, processing, recycling and disposal of solid waste.
50 (NRS 444.500) Section 28.3 of this bill revises the definition of “solid waste management
51 system” to mean the entire process of storage, collection, transportation, processing,
52 recycling or disposal of solid waste.

Assembly Amendment No. 50 to Assembly Bill No. 40 Page 5
53 Existing law requires a solid waste management authority to issue permits to
54 operate disposal sites. (NRS 444.553) Section 28.7 of this bill requires a solid waste
55 management authority to also issue permits to operate solid waste management facilities.
56 Section 32.1 of this bill requires the State Environmental Commission to adopt
57 regulations concerning standards for the issuance, renewal, modification, suspension,
58 revocation and denial of, and for the imposition of terms and conditions for, a permit to
59 construct or operate a solid waste management facility. Sections 32.1-32.4 and 32.8 of
60 this bill make certain provisions of existing law relating to disposal sites applicable to
61 solid waste management facilities.
62 Section 22 of this bill defines the term “solid waste management facility” to mean
63 any place that engages in any activity related to a solid waste management system.
64 Section 23.5 of this bill authorizes the State Environmental Commission to adopt
65 regulations establishing activities that are related to a solid waste management system
66 and the places which constitute a solid waste management facility based on the activities
67 performed at the place.
68 Existing law requires the owner or operator of a municipal solid waste landfill to obtain a
69 permit from a solid waste management authority before constructing or operating the
70 municipal solid waste landfill. The permit must be conditioned upon all requirements
71 necessary to ensure compliance with certain federal laws governing solid waste, including
72 financial requirements for the owners and operators of municipal solid waste landfills. (NRS
73 444.465, 444.556) Section [28 of this bill revises the definition of the term “municipal solid
74 waste landfill” to exclude a landfill that receives waste from a very small quantity generator.
75 Section 23 of this bill defines the term “very small quantity generator.”
76 Section 29 of this bill requires the owner or operator of a solid waste management facility
77 to also obtain a permit from a solid waste management authority. Sections 30-32] 30 of this
78 bill [apply certain other requirements in existing law governing municipal] revises certain
79 references to the term “municipal solid waste [landfills to solid waste management
80 facilities.
81 Section 22] landfill.” Section 32.6 of this bill [defines the term “solid waste management
82 facility” to mean a facility or location that engages in any activity related to a solid waste
83 management system. Section 27 of this bill revises the definition of the term “disposal site” to
84 include a solid waste management facility.] revises a reference to a sanitary landfill with a
85 reference to a municipal solid waste landfill. Section 32 of this bill prohibits a municipal
86 solid waste landfill from accepting hazardous waste from a very small quantity
87 generator.
88 Section 24 of this bill requires the [State Environmental] Commission to adopt
89 regulations prescribing the requirements for an owner or operator of a municipal solid waste
90 landfill or solid waste management facility to demonstrate financial responsibility.
91 Section 29 [also] of this bill provides that certain requirements for a permit relating to
92 standards of care and financial responsibility may be satisfied by a plan for reclamation under
93 certain circumstances.
94 Section 25 of this bill provides that [, upon the issuance of an order or action taken by a
95 solid waste management authority under existing law,] the Division or solid waste
96 management authority [has a] may lien [on] all real and personal property associated with a
97 municipal solid waste landfill or solid waste management facility of [the person who is the
98 subject of the order or action.] an owner or operator of the municipal solid waste landfill
99 or solid waste management facility.
100 Section 26 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law and [sections] section 22
101 [and 23] governing the collection and disposal of solid waste to the provisions of sections 22-
102 25.
103 Existing law establishes provisions governing the disposal of hazardous waste through the
104 management of hazardous waste, which is defined as the systematic control of the
105 generation, collection, storage, transportation, processing, treatment, recovery and disposal of
106 hazardous waste. (NRS 459.400-459.600) [Sections 36, 38-45 and 47-52] Section 39 of this
107 bill [expand] revises: (1) the definition of the management of hazardous waste to mean
108 the systematic control of the generation, collection, storage, transportation, recycling,
109 processing, treatment, recovery or disposal of hazardous waste; and as a result: (2)
110 expands the applicability of these requirements governing hazardous waste to include
111 recycling as a method for the disposal of hazardous waste [.] and any systematic control of

Assembly Amendment No. 50 to Assembly Bill No. 40 Page 6
112 the generation, collection, storage, transportation, recycling, processing, treatment,
113 recovery or disposal of hazardous waste.
114 Sections 36, 40, 44, 46-51, 52 and 53 of this bill remove references to specific
115 activities constituting the management of hazardous waste. Sections 37.5, 38.5 and 40-41
116 of this bill revise certain definitions relating to the disposal of hazardous waste.
117 Sections 46 [and 53-55] , 53 and 54 of this bill apply certain existing criminal and civil
118 penalties and disciplinary actions to the [recycling] management of hazardous waste. [As a
119 result of the inclusion of recycling, certain existing fees and reimbursements relating to the
120 management of hazardous waste also apply to the recycling of hazardous waste. (NRS
121 459.500, 459.512, 459.537, 459.548, 459.634)]
122 Section 34 of this bill defines the term “recycling” to mean the [process] processing of
123 [using] hazardous waste to recover materials or produce a usable product. Section 36
124 establishes that an additional purpose of the provisions of existing law governing the
125 disposal of hazardous waste includes conserving resources of material and energy
126 through the recycling or recovery of hazardous waste.
127 Section 35 of this bill provides that [upon the issuance of an order under certain
128 provisions of existing law,] the Department [has a] may lien [on] all real and personal
129 property associated with a facility for the management of hazardous waste of the [person
130 who is the subject of the order.] owner, operator or holder of a permit of the facility.
131 Section 37 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law and section 34 governing the
132 disposal of hazardous waste to the provisions of sections 34 and 35.
133 Existing law requires the Commission, through the Department, to develop a
134 program to encourage the minimization of hazardous waste and the recycling or reuse of
135 hazardous waste. (NRS 459.485) Section 43 of this bill removes the requirement that the
136 program include the reuse of hazardous waste.
137 Existing law prohibits a person from constructing, substantially altering or
138 operating a facility for the treatment, storage or disposal of hazardous waste or treating,
139 storing or disposing of hazardous waste unless the person has first obtained a permit
140 from the Department. (NRS 459.515) Section 46 provides that the person must only
141 obtain a permit if the Commission has required by regulation that type of facility to
142 obtain a permit. Section 47 requires the Commission to adopt regulations establishing
143 the types of facilities for the management of hazardous waste which must obtain a
144 permit.
145 Existing law requires the Commission to adopt regulations requiring the owner or
146 operator of any facility for the treatment, storage or disposal of hazardous waste to show
147 his or her financial responsibility for the undertaking. (NRS 459.525) Section 48 requires
148 the Commission to adopt regulations establishing the types of facilities for the
149 management of hazardous waste which must show financial responsibility.
150 Existing law provides that certain provisions of existing law authorizing any
151 authorized representative or employee of the Commission or Department to conduct
152 certain inspections relating to hazardous substances and authorizing the Department to
153 issue certain orders relating to hazardous substances do not apply in a county whose
154 population is less than 55,000 (currently all counties except Clark County, Washoe
155 County, Lyon County and Carson City). (NRS 459.558) Section 51.5 of this bill removes
156 this exemption.
157 Existing law prohibits a person from transporting hazardous waste to a facility that
158 has not been issued a permit to treat, store or dispose of hazardous waste. (NRS 459.590)
159 Section 54.5 of this bill instead prohibits a person from transporting hazardous waste to
160 a facility that has not been authorized to accept hazardous waste in accordance with
161 certain regulations adopted by the Commission.

41 liability for any injury to any person or property caused by any act of a person to
42 whom the permission is granted. The provisions of this subsection do not confer
43 any liability upon a protected person for any injury to any other person or property,
44 whether actual or implied, or create a duty of care or ground of liability for any
45 injury to any person or property.
46 6. Except in the case of an emergency, an operator shall not depart from an
47 approved plan for reclamation without prior written approval from the Division.
