Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes provisions governing the reclamation of land subject to
2 mining operations or exploration projects. (Chapter 519A of NRS) Section 13 of
3 this bill revises the definition of the term “reclamation” to include actions
4 performed during or after an exploration project or mining operation to stabilize
5 process fluids. Sections 2-9 of this bill define certain terms relating to reclamation.
6 Section 14 of this bill revises the definition of the term “surety” to include an
7 account held by or for the benefit of the Division of Environmental Protection of
8 the State Department of Conservation and Natural Resources.
9 Section 10 of this bill authorizes the Division to issue a summary order if the
10 Division has reasonable cause to believe that a person is about to violate certain
11 provisions of existing law relating to the reclamation of land.
12 Section 11 of this bill provides that, upon the issuance of a notice of
13 noncompliance or a summary order to a person holding a permit for an exploration
14 project or mining operation, the Division has a lien on all real and personal property
15 of the person.
16 Section 12 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law and sections 2-9
17 governing reclamation to the provisions of sections 10 and 11.
18 Section 15 of this bill authorizes certain fees collected by the Division that are
19 used to administer the provisions of existing law relating to reclamation to also be
20 used to administer the provisions of sections 2-11.
21 Existing law requires an applicant for a permit to engage in a mining operation
22 to, amongst other requirements, complete a checklist developed by the Division and
23 file a plan for reclamation with the application. (NRS 519A.210, 519A.220)
24 Section 16 of this bill requires that the information requested by the checklist
25 include a manual for the operation and maintenance of the fluid management
26 system for the mining operation. Section 17 of this bill requires a plan for
27 reclamation to provide for the stabilization of process fluids.
28 Existing law provides that if an exploration project or a mining operation are
29 conducted on: (1) land administered by a federal agency, an approved federal plan
30 of operations and surety that are consistent with certain requirements supersedes
31 certain requirements for a permit and bond or other surety; or (2) both public land
32 and privately owned land, compliance with the approved federal plan of operations
33 is sufficient if that plan substantially provides for the reclamation and bond or other
34 surety required by existing law. (NRS 519A.240) Section 18 of this bill requires the
35 Division to approve: (1) any parts of a federal plan of operations and surety
36 approved by a federal agency for an exploration project or a mining operation
37 conducted on land administered by a federal agency that include the stabilization of
38 process fluids; and (2) a federal plan of operations and surety approved by a federal
39 agency for an exploration project or a mining operation conducted on a site that
40 includes both public and privately owned land.
41 Sections 19 and 20 of this bill apply certain disciplinary actions and criminal
42 penalties to the provisions of sections 2-11.
43 Existing law requires the owner or operator of a municipal solid waste landfill
44 to obtain a permit from a solid waste management authority before constructing or
45 operating the municipal solid waste landfill. The permit must be conditioned upon
46 all requirements necessary to ensure compliance with certain federal laws
47 governing solid waste, including financial requirements for the owners and
48 operators of municipal solid waste landfills. (NRS 444.465, 444.556) Section 28 of
49 this bill revises the definition of the term “municipal solid waste landfill” to
50 exclude a landfill that receives waste from a very small quantity generator. Section
51 23 of this bill defines the term “very small quantity generator.”
52 Section 29 of this bill requires the owner or operator of a solid waste
53 management facility to also obtain a permit from a solid waste management

54 authority. Sections 30-32 of this bill apply certain other requirements in existing
55 law governing municipal solid waste landfills to solid waste management facilities.
56 Section 22 of this bill defines the term “solid waste management facility” to
57 mean a facility or location that engages in any activity related to a solid waste
58 management system. Section 27 of this bill revises the definition of the term
59 “disposal site” to include a solid waste management facility.
60 Section 24 of this bill requires the State Environmental Commission to adopt
61 regulations prescribing the requirements for an owner or operator of a municipal
62 solid waste landfill or solid waste management facility to demonstrate financial
63 responsibility.
64 Section 29 also provides that certain requirements for a permit relating to
65 standards of care and financial responsibility may be satisfied by a plan for
66 reclamation under certain circumstances.
67 Section 25 of this bill provides that, upon the issuance of an order or action
68 taken by a solid waste management authority under existing law, the Division or
69 solid waste management authority has a lien on all real and personal property of the
70 person who is the subject of the order or action.
71 Section 26 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law and sections 22
72 and 23 governing the collection and disposal of solid waste to the provisions of
73 sections 22-25.
74 Existing law establishes provisions governing the disposal of hazardous waste
75 through the generation, collection, storage, transportation, processing, treatment,
76 recovery and disposal of hazardous waste. (NRS 459.400-459.600) Sections 36,
77 38-45 and 47-52 of this bill expand the applicability of these requirements
78 governing hazardous waste to include recycling as a method for the disposal of
79 hazardous waste. Sections 46 and 53-55 of this bill apply certain existing criminal
80 and civil penalties and disciplinary actions to the recycling of hazardous waste. As
81 a result of the inclusion of recycling, certain existing fees and reimbursements
82 relating to the management of hazardous waste also apply to the recycling of
83 hazardous waste. (NRS 459.500, 459.512, 459.537, 459.548, 459.634)
84 Section 34 of this bill defines the term “recycling” to mean the process of using
85 hazardous waste to recover materials or produce a usable product.
86 Section 35 of this bill provides that upon the issuance of an order under certain
87 provisions of existing law, the Department has a lien on all real and personal
88 property of the person who is the subject of the order.
89 Section 37 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law and section 34
90 governing the disposal of hazardous waste to the provisions of sections 34 and 35.

8 to this section, and is doing so on the effective date of the
9 regulations establishing procedures for the system of permits; and
10 (b) Has made an application for a permit,

12 application has been acted upon, unless a delay in that action was
13 caused by the person’s failure to furnish information which was
14 reasonably requested or required for the processing of the
15 application.
16 3. The Commission may require a person who is conducting an
17 activity pursuant to subsection 2 to comply with requirements which
18 it has specified by regulation before a permit is issued.

24 material installed beneath and on the sides of a landfill which
25 restricts the downward or lateral escape of hazardous waste,
26 hazardous waste constituents or leachate, and prevents the migration
27 of waste to the adjacent subsurface soils, groundwater and surface
28 water.
29 Sec. 48. NRS 459.525 is hereby amended to read as follows:
30 459.525 1. The Commission shall adopt regulations requiring

34 (a) Evidence that the owner or operator has a policy of liability
35 insurance in an amount which the Department has determined is
36 necessary for the protection of human health, public safety and the
37 environment;
38 (b) Evidence of security, in a form and amount which the
39 Department deems necessary, to ensure that at the time of any
40 abandonment, cessation or interruption of the service provided by
41 the facility, and thereafter, all appropriate measures will be taken to

9 (a) Has filed a petition in bankruptcy, or is the object of an
10 involuntary petition;
11 (b) Cannot respond in damages in the event a judgment is
12 entered against the owner or operator; or

14 or any other state, or of the United States, or cannot, with due
15 diligence, be served with process.
16 4. If a claim is asserted directly against a person providing
17 evidence of financial responsibility, that person may assert any right
18 or defense which:
19 (a) The person might have asserted in any action against him or
20 her by the owner or operator; or
21 (b) The owner or operator might have asserted, had the claim
22 been made against him or her.
23 Sec. 49. NRS 459.537 is hereby amended to read as follows:

25 an accident or motor vehicle crash involving hazardous waste,
26 hazardous material or a regulated substance does not act promptly
27 and appropriately to clean and decontaminate the affected area
28 properly, and if his or her inaction presents an imminent and

6 hazardous material or a regulated substance, or the area used for the
7 disposal or recycling of the waste, material or substance. Payment
8 of the reimbursement is due within 60 days after the person receives
9 notice from the Director of the amount due. The provisions of this
10 section do not apply to a spill or leak of or an accident or motor
11 vehicle crash involving natural gas or liquefied petroleum gas while
12 it is under the responsibility of a public utility.
13 3. At the request of the Director, the Attorney General shall
14 initiate recovery by legal action of the amount of any unpaid
15 reimbursement plus interest at a rate determined pursuant to NRS
16 17.130 computed from the date of the incident.
17 4. As used in this section:

31 and substantial hazard to human health, public safety or the
32 environment.
33 (b) “Responding” means any efforts to mitigate, attempt to
34 mitigate or assist in the mitigation of the effects of a leak or spill of
35 or an accident or motor vehicle crash involving hazardous waste,

29 fails to comply with the requirements of subsection 7 of
30 NRS 459.520.
31 Sec. 51. NRS 459.550 is hereby amended to read as follows:
