EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to taxation; revising the amount of the tax on live entertainment
that is required to be distributed to the Nevada Arts Council; requiring
the Nevada Arts Council to use a portion of such distributions to
make grants to certain persons; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law imposes an excise tax on admission to any facility in this State where live
2 entertainment is provided, at a rate of 9 percent of the admission charge. Under existing law,
3 the tax is required to be added to the purchase of the admission and paid by the purchaser at
4 the time of purchase. (NRS 368A.200) If the live entertainment is provided at a licensed
5 gaming establishment, the person licensed to conduct gaming at the establishment is required
6 to pay the tax to the Nevada Gaming Control Board. If the live entertainment is not provided
7 at a licensed gaming establishment, the person collecting the tax from purchasers is required
8 to remit the tax to the Department of Taxation. (NRS 368A.110, 368A.140) Existing law
9 requires the Board and the Department to deposit all taxes, interest and penalties received
10 from the excise tax on live entertainment in the State Treasury for credit to the State General
11 Fund, except that, on or before October 1 of each year, the Department is required to deposit
12 $150,000 from the taxes, interest and penalties it receives in the State Treasury for credit to
13 the Nevada Arts Council as a continuing appropriation. (NRS 368A.220) This bill revises the
14 amount of the excise tax on live entertainment that is required to be deposited in the State
15 Treasury for credit to the Nevada Arts Council by requiring that: (1) an amount equal to 1
16 percent of such taxes, and the interest and penalties on such taxes, received by the Board and
17 the Department in the immediately preceding fiscal year be deposited in the State Treasury for
18 credit to the Nevada Arts Council ; [as a continuing appropriation;] and (2) any additional
19 amount of such taxes, and the interest and penalties on such taxes, be deposited in the State
20 Treasury for credit to the State General Fund. This bill requires the Nevada Arts Council to
21 use at least 90 percent of the amount of such taxes credited to the Nevada Arts Council
22 to make grants to artists and local arts agencies in this State. This bill
23 states the intent of the Legislature that the amount of such taxes credited to the Nevada
24 Arts Council not be used to replace or supplant funding available from other sources.
