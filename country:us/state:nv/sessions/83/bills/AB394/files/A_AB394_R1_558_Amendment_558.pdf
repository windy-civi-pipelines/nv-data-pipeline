AN ACT relating to higher education; authorizing the Board of Regents of the

System of Higher Education to adopt an emergency response plan to

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 This bill authorizes the Board of Regents of the University of Nevada to require each
2 institution within the Nevada System of Higher Education to adopt an emergency response
3 plan to address opioid-related drug overdoses at the institution. This bill requires such an
4 emergency response plan to include: (1) plans for providing education on opioid-related drug
5 overdoses; and (2) procedures for the distribution and administration of opioid antagonists.
6 This bill prohibits an institution from adopting a plan that requires a person to complete
7 training in order to obtain or administer an opioid antagonist. This bill authorizes the Board of
8 Regents to adopt a model emergency response plan to assist institutions in developing their
9 own plans.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 396 of NRS is hereby amended by adding thereto a new
2 section to read as follows:

4 in consultation with the Division of Public and Behavioral Health of the
5 Department of Health and Human Services, adopt an emergency response plan to

7 response plan must include, without limitation:

11 2. Each institution within the System may tailor the emergency response
12 plan described in subsection 1 to meet the needs and capacity of the institution

18 accessible; and

20 institution.
21 3. An emergency response plan described in subsection 1 may not require a
22 person to complete any training in order to obtain or administer an opioid
23 antagonist.
24 4. The Board of Regents may adopt a model emergency response plan that
25 meets the requirements of this section to assist institutions in developing their
26 emergency response plans pursuant to subsection 1. The Board of Regents may
27 not require an institution to utilize the model emergency response plan.
28 5. As used in this section:
