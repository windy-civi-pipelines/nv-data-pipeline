Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 This bill authorizes the Board of Regents of the University of Nevada to require each
2 institution within the Nevada System of Higher Education to adopt an emergency response
3 plan to address opioid-related drug overdoses at the institution. This bill requires such an
4 emergency response plan to include: (1) plans for providing education on opioid-related drug
5 overdoses; and (2) procedures for the distribution and administration of opioid antagonists.
6 This bill prohibits an institution from adopting a plan that requires a person to complete
7 training in order to obtain or administer an opioid antagonist. This bill authorizes the Board of
8 Regents to adopt a model emergency response plan to assist institutions in developing their
9 own plans.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

6 address opioid-related drug overdoses at the institution. Such an emergency
7 response plan must include, without limitation:

8 2. Each institution within the System may tailor the emergency response

15 accessible; and
16 (c) The manner in which opioid antagonists will be distributed at the
17 institution.

19 person to complete any training in order to obtain or administer an opioid
20 antagonist.
21 4. The Board of Regents may adopt a model emergency response plan that
22 meets the requirements of this section to assist institutions in developing their
23 emergency response plans pursuant to subsection 1. The Board of Regents may
24 not require an institution to utilize the model emergency response plan.
25 5. As used in this section:
26 (a) “Opioid antagonist” has the meaning ascribed to it in NRS 453C.040.
27 (b) “Opioid-related drug overdose” has the meaning ascribed to it in NRS
