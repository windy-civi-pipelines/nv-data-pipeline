EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to child welfare; adopting a revised version of the
Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, the interstate transportation of children for placement in
2 foster care, as a preliminary to a possible adoption or for placement in a juvenile
3 justice institution is governed by the Interstate Compact on the Placement of
4 Children. The Compact prohibits a governmental entity or person from sending a
5 child into another state for those purposes unless: (1) the governmental entity or
6 person provides certain notice to the appropriate public authority in the state where
7 the child is to be sent; and (2) that public authority notifies the sending
8 governmental entity or person that the proposed placement does not appear to be
9 contrary to the best interests of the child. The Compact provides that the
10 governmental entity or person sending the child into another state retains
11 jurisdiction over the child until the child is adopted, reaches majority, becomes self-
12 supporting or is discharged with the concurrence of the appropriate authority in the
13 state where the child is sent. The Compact also authorizes the sending of a child
14 who has been adjudicated delinquent to an institution in another state only if: (1)
15 equivalent facilities for the child are not available in the sending agency’s
16 jurisdiction; and (2) institutional care in the state where the child is sent is in the
17 best interest of the child and will not produce undue hardship. (NRS 127.330)
18 Sections 1 and 2 of this bill adopt and enter into a revised version of the
19 Compact. That version of the Compact applies to the interstate placement of a
20 child: (1) who is subject to child welfare proceedings in the sending state; (2) for
21 juvenile justice purposes, if certain aspects of the placement are not covered by
-
*AB518*

– 2 –
22 another interstate compact; or (3) by a public or private child placing agency as a
23 preliminary step to a possible adoption. With certain exceptions, a sending state
24 retains jurisdiction over such a child under the revised version of the Compact.
25 However, the revised version of the Compact authorizes a sending state to
26 terminate its jurisdiction under certain circumstances, including several
27 circumstances where such jurisdiction is no longer necessary. If an issue of child
28 protection or custody is brought before a court in the receiving state, the revised
29 version of the Compact requires that court to confer with the court of the sending
30 state to determine the most appropriate forum for adjudication. The revised version
31 of the Compact: (1) requires that a public agency in a receiving state approve a
32 placement before the child may be placed in that state; and (2) establishes a
33 procedure for a receiving state to evaluate the safety and suitability of a proposed
34 placement in that state. The revised version of the Compact assigns among various
35 entities in the sending state and the receiving state, depending on the circumstances
36 of the placement, the financial responsibility for a child placed in the receiving state
37 and certain other duties. The revised version of the Compact additionally creates
38 the Interstate Commission for the Placement of Children, which is a joint
39 commission of member states. The revised version of the Compact requires the
40 Interstate Commission to adopt rules governing the Compact, provide dispute
41 resolution among member states, issue advisory opinions, enforce the Compact
42 through legal action and perform various other duties in furtherance of the purposes
43 of the Compact. The revised version of the Compact authorizes the Interstate
44 Commission to levy an annual assessment on member states to cover the annual
45 budget of the Interstate Commission.
46 The version of the Compact set forth in existing law requires the executive head
47 of each member jurisdiction to designate an officer to act as the administrator and
48 general coordinator of activities under the compact. (NRS 127.330) Existing law
49 accordingly requires the Governor to designate such an administrator and requires
50 the administrator to perform certain duties related to the implementation of the
51 Compact. (NRS 127.340, 127.350) The revised version of the Compact set forth in
52 section 1 does not provide for an administrator but instead requires each member
53 state to establish a central state compact office to ensure compliance with
54 the Compact. Sections 3 and 4 of this bill transfer the responsibilities of the
55 administrator to the central state compact office, and section 3 requires the
56 Governor to appoint an executive head of the central state compact office.
57 The revised version of the Compact becomes effective when it is enacted by at
58 least 35 states. Currently, 18 states have enacted the revised version of the
59 Compact. Section 11 of this bill repeals the original version of the Compact on the
60 date on which the 35th state enacts the revised version of the Compact, thereby
61 making that version effective. Sections 5-9 of this bill make conforming changes to
62 require compliance with the revised version of the Compact when a child is placed
63 in this State under certain circumstances to which the Compact applies.

4 guilty of trafficking in children and shall be punished for a category
5 C felony as provided in NRS 193.130.
6 4. As used in this section:
7 (a) “Advertise” has the meaning ascribed to it in NRS 127.310.

9 meaning ascribed to it in NRS 432B.030.
10 (c) “Child” means a person who is less than 18 years of age.
11 (d) “Child-placing agency” has the meaning ascribed to it in
12 NRS 127.220.
13 Sec. 6. NRS 424.260 is hereby amended to read as follows:
14 424.260 1. A foster care agency shall notify the licensing
15 authority before the foster care agency authorizes the placement of a
16 child who is not being placed through the licensing authority or a
17 juvenile court.
18 2. A foster care agency may not agree to place a child who is
19 relocating from another state unless the foster care agency first
20 consults the licensing authority to determine whether the provisions
21 of the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children pursuant to
22 NRS 127.320 to 127.350, inclusive, and section 1 of this act or the
23 Interstate Compact for Juveniles pursuant to NRS 62I.015 apply. If
24 the licensing authority determines that the provisions of either
25 Compact apply, the foster care agency may not agree to place the
26 child unless the placement would not violate the provisions of the
27 Compact.
28 3. A foster care agency shall give priority to assisting with the
29 placement of a child by an agency which provides child welfare
30 services or a juvenile court.
31 Sec. 7. NRS 432B.390 is hereby amended to read as follows:
32 432B.390 1. An agent or officer of a law enforcement
33 agency, an officer of the local juvenile probation department or the

– 26 –
1 parent of the child is or may be the result of an act by the other
2 parent that constitutes domestic violence pursuant to NRS 33.018.

8 parent of a child is or may be the result of an act by the other parent
9 that constitutes domestic violence pursuant to NRS 33.018, a
10 protective custody hearing must be held pursuant to NRS 432B.470,
11 whether the child was placed in protective custody or with a
12 relative. If an agency other than an agency which provides child
13 welfare services becomes aware that there is reasonable cause to
14 believe that the death of a parent of a child is or may be the result of
15 an act by the other parent that constitutes domestic violence
16 pursuant to NRS 33.018, that agency shall immediately notify the
17 agency which provides child welfare services and a protective
18 custody hearing must be scheduled.
19 4. An agency which provides child welfare services shall
20 request the assistance of a law enforcement agency in the removal of

23 with harm.
24 5. Before taking a child for placement in protective custody,
25 the person taking the child shall show his or her identification to any
26 person who is responsible for the child and is present at the time the
27 child is taken. If a person who is responsible for the child is not
28 present at the time the child is taken, the person taking the child
29 shall show his or her identification to any other person upon request.
30 The identification required by this subsection must be a single card
31 that contains a photograph of the person taking the child and
32 identifies the person as a person authorized pursuant to this section
33 to place a child in protective custody.
34 6. A child placed in protective custody pending an
35 investigation and a hearing held pursuant to NRS 432B.470 must be
36 placed, except as otherwise provided in NRS 432B.3905, in the
37 following order of priority:

3 7. Whenever possible, a child placed pursuant to subsection 6
4 must be placed together with any siblings of the child. Such a child
5 must not be placed in a jail or other place for detention,

11 remaining in the home or facility, if necessary;
12 (b) Immediately make a reasonable effort to inform the person
13 responsible for the child’s welfare that the child has been placed in
14 protective custody; and
15 (c) As soon as practicable, inform the agency which provides
16 child welfare services and the appropriate law enforcement agency,
17 except that if the placement violates the provisions of NRS
18 432B.3905, the person shall immediately provide such notification.
19 9. If a child is placed with any person who resides outside this
20 State, the placement must be in accordance with [NRS 127.330.]
21 section 1 of this act.
22 Sec. 8. NRS 432B.480 is hereby amended to read as follows:
23 432B.480 1. At each hearing conducted pursuant to

25 (a) At the commencement of the hearing, the court shall advise
26 the parties of their right to be represented by an attorney and of their
27 right to present evidence.
28 (b) The court shall determine whether there is reasonable cause
29 to believe that it would be:
30 (1) Contrary to the welfare of the child for the child to reside
31 at his or her home; or
32 (2) In the best interests of the child to place the child outside
33 of his or her home.
34  The court shall prepare an explicit statement of the facts upon
35 which each of its determinations is based. The court shall not make
36 an affirmative finding regarding either subparagraph (1) or (2)
37 solely because the person responsible for the welfare of the child is
38 deaf, is blind, as defined in NRS 426.082, or has another physical
39 disability or is the holder of a valid registry identification card. If the
40 court makes an affirmative finding regarding either subparagraph
41 (1) or (2), the court shall issue an order keeping the child in
42 protective custody pending a disposition by the court.
43 (c) The court shall determine whether the child has been placed
44 in a home or facility that complies with the requirements of NRS
45 432B.3905. If the placement does not comply with the requirements
-
*AB518*

– 28 –
1 of NRS 432B.3905, the court shall establish a plan with the agency
2 which provides child welfare services for the prompt transfer of the
3 child into a home or facility that complies with the requirements of
4 NRS 432B.3905.
5 2. If the court issues an order keeping the child in protective
6 custody pending a disposition by the court and it is in the best
7 interests of the child, the court may:
8 (a) Place the child in the temporary custody of a grandparent,
9 great-grandparent or other person related within the fifth degree of
10 consanguinity to the child who the court finds has established a
11 meaningful relationship with the child, with or without supervision
12 upon such conditions as the court prescribes, regardless of whether
13 the relative resides within this State; or
14 (b) Grant the grandparent, great-grandparent or other person
15 related within the fifth degree of consanguinity to the child a
16 reasonable right to visit the child while the child is in protective
17 custody.
18 3. If the court finds that the best interests of the child do not
19 require that the child remain in protective custody, the court shall
20 order the immediate release of the child.
21 4. If a child is placed with any person who resides outside this
22 State, the placement must be in accordance with [NRS 127.330.]
23 section 1 of this act.
24 5. As used in this section, “holder of a valid registry
25 identification card” means a person who holds a valid registry
26 identification card as defined in NRS 678C.080 that identifies the
27 person as:
28 (a) Exempt from state prosecution for engaging in the medical
29 use of cannabis; or
30 (b) A designated primary caregiver as defined in
31 NRS 678C.040.
32 Sec. 9. NRS 432B.550 is hereby amended to read as follows:
33 432B.550 1. If the court finds that a child is in need of
34 protection, it may, by its order, after receipt and review of the report
35 from the agency which provides child welfare services:
36 (a) Permit the child to remain in the temporary or permanent
37 custody of the parents of the child or a guardian with or without
38 supervision by the court or a person or agency designated by the
39 court, and with or without retaining jurisdiction of the case, upon
40 such conditions as the court may prescribe;
41 (b) Place the child in the temporary or permanent custody of a
42 relative, a fictive kin or other person the court finds suitable to
43 receive and care for the child with or without supervision, and with
44 or without retaining jurisdiction of the case, upon such conditions as
45 the court may prescribe; or
-
*AB518*

– 29 –
1 (c) Place the child in the temporary custody of a public agency
2 or institution authorized to care for children, the local juvenile
3 probation department, the local department of juvenile services or a
4 private agency or institution licensed by the Department of Health
5 and Human Services or a county whose population is 100,000 or
6 more to care for such a child.
7  In carrying out this subsection, the court may, in its sole
8 discretion and in compliance with the requirements of chapter 159A
9 of NRS, consider an application for the guardianship of the child. If
10 the court grants such an application, it may retain jurisdiction of the
11 case or transfer the case to another court of competent jurisdiction.
12 2. The court shall not deny placement of a child in the
13 temporary or permanent custody of a person pursuant to subsection
14 1 solely because the person:
15 (a) Is deaf, is blind or has another physical disability; or
16 (b) Is the holder of a valid registry identification card.
17 3. If, pursuant to subsection 1, a child is placed other than with
18 a parent:
19 (a) The parent retains the right to consent to adoption, to
20 determine the child’s religious affiliation and to reasonable
21 visitation, unless restricted by the court. If the custodian of the child
22 interferes with these rights, the parent may petition the court for
23 enforcement of the rights of the parent.
24 (b) The court shall set forth good cause why the child was
25 placed other than with a parent.
26 4. If, pursuant to subsection 1, the child is to be placed with a
27 relative or fictive kin, the court may consider, among other factors,
28 whether the child has resided with a particular relative or fictive kin
29 for 3 years or more before the incident which brought the child to
30 the court’s attention.
31 5. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, a copy of
32 the report prepared for the court by the agency which provides child
33 welfare services must be sent to the custodian and the parent or legal
34 guardian. If the child was delivered to a provider of emergency
35 services pursuant to NRS 432B.630:
36 (a) The parent who delivered the child to the provider shall be
37 deemed to have waived his or her right to a copy of the report; and
38 (b) A copy of the report must be sent to the parent who did not
39 deliver the child to the provider, if the location of such parent is
40 known.
41 6. In determining the placement of a child pursuant to this
42 section, if the child is not permitted to remain in the custody of the
43 parents of the child or guardian:
44 (a) It must be presumed to be in the best interests of the child to
45 be placed together with the siblings of the child.
-

1 (b) Preference must be given to placing the child in the
2 following order:
3 (1) With any person related within the fifth degree of

6 whether the relative or fictive kin resides within this State.
7 (2) In a foster home that is licensed pursuant to chapter 424
8 of NRS.
9 7. Any search for a relative with whom to place a child
10 pursuant to this section must be completed within 1 year after the
11 initial placement of the child outside of the home of the child. If a
12 child is placed with any person who resides outside of this State, the
13 placement must be in accordance with [NRS 127.330.] section 1 of
14 this act.
15 8. Within 60 days after the removal of a child from the home of
16 the child, the court shall:
17 (a) Determine whether:
18 (1) The agency which provides child welfare services has
19 made the reasonable efforts required by paragraph (a) of subsection
20 1 of NRS 432B.393; or
21 (2) No such efforts are required in the particular case; and

31 (2) A designated primary caregiver as defined in
32 NRS 678C.040.
33 Sec. 10. The provisions of NRS 354.599 do not apply to any
34 additional expenses of a local government that are related to the

TEXT OF REPEALED SECTION
127.330 Text of compact. The Interstate Compact on the
Placement of Children is as follows:
INTERSTATE COMPACT ON THE
PLACEMENT OF CHILDREN
ARTICLE I. Purpose and Policy
It is the purpose and policy of the party states to cooperate with
each other in the interstate placement of children to the end that:
(a) Each child requiring placement receives the maximum
opportunity to be placed in a suitable environment and with persons
or institutions having appropriate qualifications and facilities to
provide a necessary and desirable degree and type of care.
(b) The appropriate authorities in a state where a child is to be
placed may have full opportunity to ascertain the circumstances of
the proposed placement, thereby promoting full compliance with
applicable requirements for the protection of the child.
(c) The proper authorities of the state from which the placement
is made may obtain the most complete information on the basis of
which to evaluate a projected placement before it is made.
(d) Appropriate jurisdictional arrangements for the care of
children are promoted.
ARTICLE II. Definitions
As used in this compact:
(a) “Child” means a person who, by reason of minority, is
legally subject to parental control, guardianship or similar control.
(b) “Placement” means the arrangement for the care of a child in
a family free or boarding home or in a child-caring agency or
institution but does not include any institution caring for the
mentally ill, mentally defective or epileptic or any institution
primarily educational in character, and any hospital or other medical
facility.
-
*AB518*

– 32 –
(c) “Receiving state” means the state to which a child is sent,
brought, or caused to be sent or brought, whether by public
authorities or private persons or agencies, and whether for
placement with state or local public authorities or for placement
with private agencies or persons.
(d) “Sending agency” means a party state, officer or employee
thereof; a subdivision of a party state, or officer or employee
thereof; a court of a party state; a person, corporation, association,
charitable agency or other entity which sends, brings or causes to be
sent or brought any child to another party state.
ARTICLE III. Conditions for Placement
(a) A sending agency shall not send, bring or cause to be sent or
brought into any other party state any child for placement in foster
care or as a preliminary to a possible adoption unless the sending
agency complies with each and every requirement set forth in this
article and with the applicable laws of the receiving state governing
the placement of children therein.
(b) Prior to sending, bringing or causing any child to be sent or
brought into a receiving state for placement in foster care or as a
preliminary to a possible adoption, the sending agency shall furnish
the appropriate public authorities in the receiving state written
notice of the intention to send, bring or place the child in the
receiving state. The notice must contain:
(1) The name, date and place of birth of the child.
(2) The identity and address or addresses of the parents or
legal guardian.
(3) The name and address of the person, agency or institution
to or with which the sending agency proposes to send, bring or place
the child.
(4) A full statement of the reasons for the proposed action
and evidence of the authority pursuant to which the placement is
proposed to be made.
(c) Any public officer or agency in a receiving state which is in
receipt of a notice pursuant to paragraph (b) of this article may
request of the sending agency, or any other appropriate officer or
agency of or in the sending agency’s state, and is entitled to receive
therefrom, such supporting or additional information as it considers
necessary under the circumstances to carry out the purpose and
policy of this compact.
(d) The child must not be sent, brought or caused to be sent or
brought into the receiving state until the appropriate public
authorities in the receiving state notify the sending agency, in
-
*AB518*

– 33 –
writing, to the effect that the proposed placement does not appear to
be contrary to the interests of the child.
ARTICLE IV. Penalty for Illegal Placement
The sending, bringing or causing to be sent or brought into any
receiving state of a child in violation of the terms of this compact is
a violation of the laws respecting the placement of children of both
the state in which the sending agency is located or from which it
sends or brings the child and of the receiving state. Such a violation
may be punished or subjected to penalty in either jurisdiction in
accordance with its laws. In addition to liability for any such
punishment or penalty, the violation constitutes full and sufficient
grounds for the suspension or revocation of any license, permit or
other legal authorization held by the sending agency which
empowers or allows it to place or care for children.
ARTICLE V. Retention of Jurisdiction
(a) The sending agency retains such jurisdiction over the child
sufficient to determine all matters in relation to the custody,
supervision, care, treatment and disposition of the child as it would
have had if the child had remained in the sending agency’s state,
until the child is adopted, reaches majority, becomes self-supporting
or is discharged with the concurrence of the appropriate authority in
the receiving state. That jurisdiction also includes the power to
effect or cause the return of the child or the transfer of the child to
another location and custody pursuant to law. The sending agency
continues to have financial responsibility for support and
maintenance of the child during the period of the placement.
Nothing contained in this article defeats a claim of jurisdiction by a
receiving state sufficient to deal with an act of delinquency or crime
committed therein.
(b) When the sending agency is a public agency, it may enter
into an agreement with an authorized public or private agency in the
receiving state to provide one or more services to the child as the
agent for the sending agency.
(c) Nothing in this compact prevents a private charitable agency
authorized to place children in the receiving state from performing
services or acting as the agent in that state for a private charitable
agency of the sending state, or to prevent the agency in the receiving
state from discharging its financial responsibility for the support and
maintenance of a child who has been placed on behalf of the
sending agency without relieving the responsibility set forth in
paragraph (a).
-
*AB518*

– 34 –
ARTICLE VI. Institutional Care of Delinquent Children
A child adjudicated delinquent may be placed in an institution in
another party jurisdiction pursuant to this compact but no such
placement may be made unless the child is given a court hearing on
notice to the parent or guardian with opportunity to be heard, prior
to the child being sent to the other party jurisdiction for institutional
care and the court finds that:
(a) Equivalent facilities for the child are not available in the
sending agency’s jurisdiction; and
(b) Institutional care in the other jurisdiction is in the best
interest of the child and will not produce undue hardship.
ARTICLE VII. Compact Administrator
The executive head of each jurisdiction party to this compact
shall designate an officer to act as the administrator and general
coordinator of activities under this compact in his or her jurisdiction
and who, acting jointly with like officers of other party jurisdictions,
may adopt regulations to carry out more effectively the terms and
provisions of this compact.
ARTICLE VIII. Limitations
This compact does not apply to:
(a) The sending or bringing of a child into a receiving state by
his or her parent, stepparent, grandparent, adult brother or sister,
adult uncle or aunt or his or her guardian and leaving the child with
any such relative or nonagency guardian in the receiving state.
(b) Any placement, sending or bringing of a child into a
receiving state pursuant to any other interstate compact to which
both the state from which the child is sent or brought and the
receiving state are parties, or to any other agreement between the
states which has the force of law.
ARTICLE IX. Enactment and Withdrawal
This compact is open to joinder by any state, territory or
possession of the United States, the District of Columbia, the
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and, with the consent of Congress,
the Government of Canada or any province thereof. It becomes
effective with respect to any jurisdiction when the jurisdiction has
enacted it into law. Withdrawal from this compact must be by the
enactment of a statute repealing it, but does not take effect until 2
years after the effective date of the statute and until written notice of
-
*AB518*

– 35 –
the withdrawal has been given by the withdrawing jurisdiction to the
executive head of each other party jurisdiction. Withdrawal of a
party jurisdiction does not affect the rights, duties and obligations
under this compact of any sending agency in that jurisdiction with
respect to a placement made prior to the effective date of
withdrawal.
ARTICLE X. Construction and Severability
The provisions of this compact must be liberally construed to
effectuate the purposes thereof. The provisions of this compact are
severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this
compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any party
state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any
government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the
validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability
thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance are not
affected thereby. If this compact is held contrary to the constitution
of any state party thereto, the compact remains in full force and
effect as to the remaining states and in full force and effect as to the
state affected as to all severable matters.
