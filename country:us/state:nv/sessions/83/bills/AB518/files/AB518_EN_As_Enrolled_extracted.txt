Section 1:
Health and Human Services
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to child welfare; adopting a revised version of the
Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Under existing law, the interstate transportation of children for placement in
foster care, as a preliminary to a possible adoption or for placement in a juvenile
justice institution is governed by the Interstate Compact on the Placement of
Children. The Compact prohibits a governmental entity or person from sending a
child into another state for those purposes unless: (1) the governmental entity or
person provides certain notice to the appropriate public authority in the state where
the child is to be sent; and (2) that public authority notifies the sending
governmental entity or person that the proposed placement does not appear to be
contrary to the best interests of the child. The Compact provides that the
governmental entity or person sending the child into another state retains
jurisdiction over the child until the child is adopted, reaches majority, becomes self-
supporting or is discharged with the concurrence of the appropriate authority in the
state where the child is sent. The Compact also authorizes the sending of a child
who has been adjudicated delinquent to an institution in another state only if: (1)
equivalent facilities for the child are not available in the sending agency’s
jurisdiction; and (2) institutional care in the state where the child is sent is in the
best interest of the child and will not produce undue hardship. (NRS 127.330)

Section 2:
Sections 1 and 2 of this bill adopt and enter into a revised version of the
Compact. That version of the Compact applies to the interstate placement of a
child: (1) who is subject to child welfare proceedings in the sending state; (2) for
juvenile justice purposes, if certain aspects of the placement are not covered by
another interstate compact; or (3) by a public or private child placing agency as a
preliminary step to a possible adoption. With certain exceptions, a sending state
retains jurisdiction over such a child under the revised version of the Compact.
However, the revised version of the Compact authorizes a sending state to
terminate its jurisdiction under certain circumstances, including several
circumstances where such jurisdiction is no longer necessary. If an issue of child
protection or custody is brought before a court in the receiving state, the revised
version of the Compact requires that court to confer with the court of the sending
state to determine the most appropriate forum for adjudication. The revised version
of the Compact: (1) requires that a public agency in a receiving state approve a
placement before the child may be placed in that state; and (2) establishes a
procedure for a receiving state to evaluate the safety and suitability of a proposed
placement in that state. The revised version of the Compact assigns among various
entities in the sending state and the receiving state, depending on the circumstances
of the placement, the financial responsibility for a child placed in the receiving state
and certain other duties. The revised version of the Compact additionally creates
the Interstate Commission for the Placement of Children, which is a joint
commission of member states. The revised version of the Compact requires the
Interstate Commission to adopt rules governing the Compact, provide dispute
resolution among member states, issue advisory opinions, enforce the Compact
through legal action and perform various other duties in furtherance of the purposes
-

of the Compact. The revised version of the Compact authorizes the Interstate
Commission to levy an annual assessment on member states to cover the annual
budget of the Interstate Commission.
The version of the Compact set forth in existing law requires the executive head
of each member jurisdiction to designate an officer to act as the administrator and
general coordinator of activities under the compact. (NRS 127.330) Existing law
accordingly requires the Governor to designate such an administrator and requires
the administrator to perform certain duties related to the implementation of the
Compact. (NRS 127.340, 127.350) The revised version of the Compact set forth in

Section 3:
section 1 does not provide for an administrator but instead requires each member
state to establish a central state compact office to ensure compliance with
the Compact. Sections 3 and 4 of this bill transfer the responsibilities of the
administrator to the central state compact office, and section 3 requires the
Governor to appoint an executive head of the central state compact office.
The revised version of the Compact becomes effective when it is enacted by at
least 35 states. Currently, 18 states have enacted the revised version of the
Compact. Section 11 of this bill repeals the original version of the Compact on the
date on which the 35th state enacts the revised version of the Compact, thereby
making that version effective. Sections 5-9 of this bill make conforming changes to
require compliance with the revised version of the Compact when a child is placed
in this State under certain circumstances to which the Compact applies.

upon such conditions as the court prescribes, regardless of whether

(b) Grant the grandparent, great-grandparent or other person
related within the fifth degree of consanguinity to the child a
reasonable right to visit the child while the child is in protective
custody.

Section 110:
3. If the court finds that the best interests of the child do not
require that the child remain in protective custody, the court shall
order the immediate release of the child.

Section 111:
4. If a child is placed with any person who resides outside this
State, the placement must be in accordance with [NRS 127.330.]

Section 112:
section 1 of this act.

Section 113:
5. As used in this section, “holder of a valid registry
identification card” means a person who holds a valid registry
identification card as defined in NRS 678C.080 that identifies the
person as:
(a) Exempt from state prosecution for engaging in the medical
use of cannabis; or
(b) A designated primary caregiver as defined in
NRS 678C.040.
Sec. 9. NRS 432B.550 is hereby amended to read as follows:
432B.550 1. If the court finds that a child is in need of
protection, it may, by its order, after receipt and review of the report
from the agency which provides child welfare services:
(a) Permit the child to remain in the temporary or permanent
custody of the parents of the child or a guardian with or without
supervision by the court or a person or agency designated by the
court, and with or without retaining jurisdiction of the case, upon
such conditions as the court may prescribe;
(b) Place the child in the temporary or permanent custody of a
relative, a fictive kin or other person the court finds suitable to
receive and care for the child with or without supervision, and with
or without retaining jurisdiction of the case, upon such conditions as
the court may prescribe; or
(c) Place the child in the temporary custody of a public agency
or institution authorized to care for children, the local juvenile
probation department, the local department of juvenile services or a
private agency or institution licensed by the Department of Health
and Human Services or a county whose population is 100,000 or
more to care for such a child.
 In carrying out this subsection, the court may, in its sole
discretion and in compliance with the requirements of chapter 159A
of NRS, consider an application for the guardianship of the child. If
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 30 –
the court grants such an application, it may retain jurisdiction of the
case or transfer the case to another court of competent jurisdiction.

Section 114:
2. The court shall not deny placement of a child in the

Section 115:
3. If, pursuant to subsection 1, a child is placed other than with
a parent:
(a) The parent retains the right to consent to adoption, to

visitation, unless restricted by the court. If the custodian of the child
interferes with these rights, the parent may petition the court for
enforcement of the rights of the parent.
(b) The court shall set forth good cause why the child was
placed other than with a parent.

Section 116:
4. If, pursuant to subsection 1, the child is to be placed with a

whether the child has resided with a particular relative or fictive kin
for 3 years or more before the incident which brought the child to
the court’s attention.

Section 117:
5. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, a copy of
the report prepared for the court by the agency which provides child
welfare services must be sent to the custodian and the parent or legal
guardian. If the child was delivered to a provider of emergency

(a) The parent who delivered the child to the provider shall be
deemed to have waived his or her right to a copy of the report; and
(b) A copy of the report must be sent to the parent who did not

whether the relative or fictive kin resides within this State.
-

– 31 –
(2) In a foster home that is licensed pursuant to chapter 424
of NRS.

Section 120:
7. Any search for a relative with whom to place a child
pursuant to this section must be completed within 1 year after the
initial placement of the child outside of the home of the child. If a
child is placed with any person who resides outside of this State, the
placement must be in accordance with [NRS 127.330.] section 1 of
this act.

Section 121:
8. Within 60 days after the removal of a child from the home of
the child, the court shall:
(a) Determine whether:

made the reasonable efforts required by paragraph (a) of subsection
1 of NRS 432B.393; or
(2) No such efforts are required in the particular case; and
(b) Prepare an explicit statement of the facts upon which its

Raw Text:
Assembly Bill No. 518–Committee on
Health and Human Services
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to child welfare; adopting a revised version of the
Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Under existing law, the interstate transportation of children for placement in
foster care, as a preliminary to a possible adoption or for placement in a juvenile
justice institution is governed by the Interstate Compact on the Placement of
Children. The Compact prohibits a governmental entity or person from sending a
child into another state for those purposes unless: (1) the governmental entity or
person provides certain notice to the appropriate public authority in the state where
the child is to be sent; and (2) that public authority notifies the sending
governmental entity or person that the proposed placement does not appear to be
contrary to the best interests of the child. The Compact provides that the
governmental entity or person sending the child into another state retains
jurisdiction over the child until the child is adopted, reaches majority, becomes self-
supporting or is discharged with the concurrence of the appropriate authority in the
state where the child is sent. The Compact also authorizes the sending of a child
who has been adjudicated delinquent to an institution in another state only if: (1)
equivalent facilities for the child are not available in the sending agency’s
jurisdiction; and (2) institutional care in the state where the child is sent is in the
best interest of the child and will not produce undue hardship. (NRS 127.330)
Sections 1 and 2 of this bill adopt and enter into a revised version of the
Compact. That version of the Compact applies to the interstate placement of a
child: (1) who is subject to child welfare proceedings in the sending state; (2) for
juvenile justice purposes, if certain aspects of the placement are not covered by
another interstate compact; or (3) by a public or private child placing agency as a
preliminary step to a possible adoption. With certain exceptions, a sending state
retains jurisdiction over such a child under the revised version of the Compact.
However, the revised version of the Compact authorizes a sending state to
terminate its jurisdiction under certain circumstances, including several
circumstances where such jurisdiction is no longer necessary. If an issue of child
protection or custody is brought before a court in the receiving state, the revised
version of the Compact requires that court to confer with the court of the sending
state to determine the most appropriate forum for adjudication. The revised version
of the Compact: (1) requires that a public agency in a receiving state approve a
placement before the child may be placed in that state; and (2) establishes a
procedure for a receiving state to evaluate the safety and suitability of a proposed
placement in that state. The revised version of the Compact assigns among various
entities in the sending state and the receiving state, depending on the circumstances
of the placement, the financial responsibility for a child placed in the receiving state
and certain other duties. The revised version of the Compact additionally creates
the Interstate Commission for the Placement of Children, which is a joint
commission of member states. The revised version of the Compact requires the
Interstate Commission to adopt rules governing the Compact, provide dispute
resolution among member states, issue advisory opinions, enforce the Compact
through legal action and perform various other duties in furtherance of the purposes
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 2 –
of the Compact. The revised version of the Compact authorizes the Interstate
Commission to levy an annual assessment on member states to cover the annual
budget of the Interstate Commission.
The version of the Compact set forth in existing law requires the executive head
of each member jurisdiction to designate an officer to act as the administrator and
general coordinator of activities under the compact. (NRS 127.330) Existing law
accordingly requires the Governor to designate such an administrator and requires
the administrator to perform certain duties related to the implementation of the
Compact. (NRS 127.340, 127.350) The revised version of the Compact set forth in
section 1 does not provide for an administrator but instead requires each member
state to establish a central state compact office to ensure compliance with
the Compact. Sections 3 and 4 of this bill transfer the responsibilities of the
administrator to the central state compact office, and section 3 requires the
Governor to appoint an executive head of the central state compact office.
The revised version of the Compact becomes effective when it is enacted by at
least 35 states. Currently, 18 states have enacted the revised version of the
Compact. Section 11 of this bill repeals the original version of the Compact on the
date on which the 35th state enacts the revised version of the Compact, thereby
making that version effective. Sections 5-9 of this bill make conforming changes to
require compliance with the revised version of the Compact when a child is placed
in this State under certain circumstances to which the Compact applies.

432B.480 1. At each hearing conducted pursuant to
NRS 432B.470:
(a) At the commencement of the hearing, the court shall advise
the parties of their right to be represented by an attorney and of their
right to present evidence.

to believe that it would be:
(1) Contrary to the welfare of the child for the child to reside
at his or her home; or

of his or her home.
 The court shall prepare an explicit statement of the facts upon

court makes an affirmative finding regarding either subparagraph
(1) or (2), the court shall issue an order keeping the child in
protective custody pending a disposition by the court.
(c) The court shall determine whether the child has been placed
in a home or facility that complies with the requirements of NRS
432B.3905. If the placement does not comply with the requirements

consanguinity to the child who the court finds has established a
meaningful relationship with the child, with or without supervision
-

– 29 –
upon such conditions as the court prescribes, regardless of whether
the relative resides within this State; or
(b) Grant the grandparent, great-grandparent or other person
related within the fifth degree of consanguinity to the child a
reasonable right to visit the child while the child is in protective
custody.
3. If the court finds that the best interests of the child do not
require that the child remain in protective custody, the court shall
order the immediate release of the child.
4. If a child is placed with any person who resides outside this
State, the placement must be in accordance with [NRS 127.330.]
section 1 of this act.
5. As used in this section, “holder of a valid registry

Sec. 9. NRS 432B.550 is hereby amended to read as follows:

(c) Place the child in the temporary custody of a public agency
or institution authorized to care for children, the local juvenile
probation department, the local department of juvenile services or a
private agency or institution licensed by the Department of Health
and Human Services or a county whose population is 100,000 or
more to care for such a child.
 In carrying out this subsection, the court may, in its sole
discretion and in compliance with the requirements of chapter 159A
of NRS, consider an application for the guardianship of the child. If
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 30 –
the court grants such an application, it may retain jurisdiction of the
case or transfer the case to another court of competent jurisdiction.

temporary or permanent custody of a person pursuant to subsection
1 solely because the person:

3. If, pursuant to subsection 1, a child is placed other than with
a parent:
(a) The parent retains the right to consent to adoption, to

(b) The court shall set forth good cause why the child was
placed other than with a parent.

for 3 years or more before the incident which brought the child to
the court’s attention.
5. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, a copy of
the report prepared for the court by the agency which provides child
welfare services must be sent to the custodian and the parent or legal
guardian. If the child was delivered to a provider of emergency
services pursuant to NRS 432B.630:
(a) The parent who delivered the child to the provider shall be
deemed to have waived his or her right to a copy of the report; and
(b) A copy of the report must be sent to the parent who did not
deliver the child to the provider, if the location of such parent is
known.
6. In determining the placement of a child pursuant to this
section, if the child is not permitted to remain in the custody of the
parents of the child or guardian:
(a) It must be presumed to be in the best interests of the child to
be placed together with the siblings of the child.
(b) Preference must be given to placing the child in the
following order:

whether the relative or fictive kin resides within this State.

(2) In a foster home that is licensed pursuant to chapter 424
of NRS.
7. Any search for a relative with whom to place a child
pursuant to this section must be completed within 1 year after the

child is placed with any person who resides outside of this State, the
placement must be in accordance with [NRS 127.330.] section 1 of
this act.
8. Within 60 days after the removal of a child from the home of
the child, the court shall:
(a) Determine whether:
(1) The agency which provides child welfare services has
made the reasonable efforts required by paragraph (a) of subsection
1 of NRS 432B.393; or
(2) No such efforts are required in the particular case; and
(b) Prepare an explicit statement of the facts upon which its
determination is based.
9. As used in this section:
(a) “Blind” has the meaning ascribed to it in NRS 426.082.
(b) “Holder of a valid registry identification card” means a
person who holds a valid registry identification card as defined in
NRS 678C.080 that identifies the person as:

medical use of cannabis; or
(2) A designated primary caregiver as defined in
NRS 678C.040.
Sec. 10. The provisions of NRS 354.599 do not apply to any
