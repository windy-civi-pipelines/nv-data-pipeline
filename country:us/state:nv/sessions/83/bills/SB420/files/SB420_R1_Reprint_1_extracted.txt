Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the governing body of a city or county to create a
2 tourism improvement district or an economic diversification district to finance
3 certain projects within the district. (Chapters 271A and 271B of NRS) This bill
4 authorizes the board of county commissioners of certain counties to create a
5 business improvement district to perform certain activities relating to transportation
6 and visitor activities. Section 2 of this bill provides that the provisions of this bill
7 may be referred to as the Business Improvement District Law. Section 3 of this bill
8 provides that the provisions of this bill apply, under certain circumstances, in any
9 region of this State governed by a regional planning agency created by interstate
10 compact (currently the Lake Tahoe Basin). Sections 5-10.5 of this bill define
11 certain terms relating to business improvement districts. Section 4 of this bill
12 applies these definitions to the provisions of this bill.
13 Section 11 of this bill authorizes a person to submit a petition to the board of
14 county commissioners to create a business improvement district. Such a petition is
15 required to: (1) be signed by the business owners in the proposed district who will
16 pay more than 50 percent of the total amount of assessments proposed to be levied
17 in the district; and (2) include a district management plan. Section 12 of this bill
18 sets forth certain requirements for a district management plan and authorizes the
19 district management plan to provide for increases in assessments for each year of
20 operation of the district.
21 Section 13 of this bill requires the board of county commissioners to hold a
22 public hearing to consider a petition to create a district and sets forth certain notice
23 requirements for the public hearing. Section 13 also: (1) authorizes any interested
24 person to make a protest orally or in writing; and (2) prohibits the board of county
25 commissioners from creating a district if the board of county commissioners
26 receives protests from the business owners or authorized representatives of the
27 businesses in the proposed district who will pay more than 50 percent of the total
28 amount of proposed assessments. Section 14 of this bill authorizes, with certain
29 exceptions, the board of county commissioners to adopt, revise, change, reduce or
30 modify the proposed assessments or the types of activities to be provided by the
31 proposed district. Section 15 of this bill authorizes the board of county
32 commissioners, following a public hearing, to create by ordinance a district and
33 requires the county clerk to maintain, and make available for public inspection, a
34 copy of the district management plan. Section 15 prohibits: (1) with certain
35 exceptions, the boundaries of a district from overlapping with the boundaries of
36 another district; and (2) the board of county commissioners from creating a district
37 in the jurisdiction of another county without the consent of the board of county
38 commissioners of that county. Additionally, section 15 provides, with certain
39 exceptions, that the term of a district may not exceed 5 years upon the initial
40 formation of the district and an additional 10 years upon renewal. Section 15.3 of
41 this bill authorizes the board of county commissioners to renew a district by
42 following the procedures for establishing a district. Section 15.3 also provides, with
43 certain exceptions, that the term of the district may not exceed 10 years upon
44 renewal. Additionally, section 15.3 requires any remaining revenue from a previous
45 district be spent to benefit the businesses that were included in the previous district
46 and in accordance with the district management plan for the previous district.
47 Section 15.7 requires a board of county commissioners to contract with an
48 owners’ association if the district management plan designated an owners’
49 association. Section 15.7 further requires an owners’ association to: (1) comply
50 with certain provisions governing the payment of prevailing wage for certain
51 contracts for a project regardless of whether the project would qualify as a public

67 formed a district to issue bonds for the benefit of the district or to enter into an
68 agreement with certain governmental entities or other persons for the cost of
69 acquiring, improving or equipping any project to be performed for the purposes of
70 the district. Section 20 of this bill requires such a board of county commissioners to
71 have an independent auditor review each claim submitted as part of any contract or
72 other agreement made with the board of county commissioners to provide any
73 financing or reimbursement.
74 Section 20.3 of this bill authorizes an owners’ association to submit a request
75 to the board of county commissioners to modify the improvements, activities or the

77 county commissioners to modify the district by ordinance after holding a public
78 hearing. Additionally, section 20.3 sets forth certain notice requirements for the
79 public hearing. If the proposed modification increases an assessment or adds a new
80 assessment, section 20.3: (1) authorizes any interested person to make a protest
81 orally or in writing; and (2) prohibits the board of county commissioners from
82 modifying a district if the board of county commissioners receives protests from the
83 business owners or authorized representatives of the businesses in the district who
84 will pay more than 50 percent of the total amount of proposed assessments.
85 Section 20.5 authorizes the board of county commissioners to dissolve a

95 Section 20.7 requires, upon the dissolution or expiration of a district, any

45 section, the county must obtain the results of a feasibility study,
-
*SB420_R1*
– 12 –
1 commissioned by the county, which shows that a sufficient amount
2 will be generated from money pledged pursuant to section 15 of
3 this act to make timely payment on the bonds or notes, taking into
4 account the revenue from any other revenue-producing projects
5 also pledged for the payment of the bonds or notes, if any. A
6 failure to make payments of any amounts due:
7 (a) With respect to any bonds or notes issued pursuant to
8 subsection 1; or
9 (b) Under any agreements entered into pursuant to
10 subsection 1,
11  because of any insufficiency in the amount of money pledged

20 county with respect to the district, any revenue received by the
21 county from any revenue-producing projects in the district or any
22 combination thereof. No bond, note or agreement issued or
23 entered into pursuant to this section may ever become a general
24 obligation of the county or a charge against its general credit or
25 taxing powers, nor may any such bond, note or agreement become
26 a debt of the county for the purposes of any limitation on
27 indebtedness.
28 4. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, any bond
29 or note issued pursuant to this section, including any bond or note
30 issued to refund any such bond or note, must mature on or before,
31 and any agreement entered into pursuant to this section must
32 automatically terminate on or before, the end of the fiscal year in
33 which the term of the district expires.
34 Sec. 20. The board of county commissioners shall require the
35 review by an independent auditor of each claim submitted

18 levied.
19 3. If protests are received from the business owners or
20 authorized representatives of the businesses in the district who will

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the governing body of a city or county to create a
2 tourism improvement district or an economic diversification district to finance
3 certain projects within the district. (Chapters 271A and 271B of NRS) This bill
4 authorizes the board of county commissioners of certain counties to create a
5 business improvement district to perform certain activities relating to transportation
6 and visitor activities. Section 2 of this bill provides that the provisions of this bill
7 may be referred to as the Business Improvement District Law. Section 3 of this bill
8 provides that the provisions of this bill apply, under certain circumstances, in any
9 region of this State governed by a regional planning agency created by interstate
10 compact (currently the Lake Tahoe Basin). Sections 5-10.5 of this bill define
11 certain terms relating to business improvement districts. Section 4 of this bill
12 applies these definitions to the provisions of this bill.
13 Section 11 of this bill authorizes a person to submit a petition to the board of
14 county commissioners to create a business improvement district. Such a petition is
15 required to: (1) be signed by the business owners in the proposed district who will
16 pay more than 50 percent of the total amount of assessments proposed to be levied
17 in the district; and (2) include a district management plan. Section 12 of this bill
18 sets forth certain requirements for a district management plan and authorizes the
19 district management plan to provide for increases in assessments for each year of
20 operation of the district.
21 Section 13 of this bill requires the board of county commissioners to hold a
22 public hearing to consider a petition to create a district and sets forth certain notice
23 requirements for the public hearing. Section 13 also: (1) authorizes any interested
24 person to make a protest orally or in writing; and (2) prohibits the board of county
25 commissioners from creating a district if the board of county commissioners
26 receives protests from the business owners or authorized representatives of the
27 businesses in the proposed district who will pay more than 50 percent of the total
28 amount of proposed assessments. Section 14 of this bill authorizes, with certain
29 exceptions, the board of county commissioners to adopt, revise, change, reduce or
30 modify the proposed assessments or the types of activities to be provided by the
31 proposed district. Section 15 of this bill authorizes the board of county
32 commissioners, following a public hearing, to create by ordinance a district and
33 requires the county clerk to maintain, and make available for public inspection, a
34 copy of the district management plan. Section 15 prohibits: (1) with certain
35 exceptions, the boundaries of a district from overlapping with the boundaries of
36 another district; and (2) the board of county commissioners from creating a district
37 in the jurisdiction of another county without the consent of the board of county
38 commissioners of that county. Additionally, section 15 provides, with certain
39 exceptions, that the term of a district may not exceed 5 years upon the initial
40 formation of the district and an additional 10 years upon renewal. Section 15.3 of
41 this bill authorizes the board of county commissioners to renew a district by
42 following the procedures for establishing a district. Section 15.3 also provides, with
43 certain exceptions, that the term of the district may not exceed 10 years upon
44 renewal. Additionally, section 15.3 requires any remaining revenue from a previous
45 district be spent to benefit the businesses that were included in the previous district
46 and in accordance with the district management plan for the previous district.
47 Section 15.7 requires a board of county commissioners to contract with an
48 owners’ association if the district management plan designated an owners’
49 association. Section 15.7 further requires an owners’ association to: (1) comply
50 with certain provisions governing the payment of prevailing wage for certain
51 contracts for a project regardless of whether the project would qualify as a public
52 work; and (2) prepare and submit a report to the county clerk concerning the
53 upcoming fiscal years in which assessments are levied.

54 Section 16 of this bill: (1) requires assessments to be levied on the basis of the
55 estimated benefit to the businesses within the district; (2) requires, with certain
56 exceptions, the revenue from the levy of assessments to be used for certain
57 purposes; and (3) authorizes the board of county commissioners to establish
58 separate benefit zones within a district and impose a different assessment within
59 each benefit zone.
60 Section 17 of this bill authorizes the board of county commissioners to enter
61 into an agreement with the Department of Taxation for the collection and
62 distribution of the assessments levied by the district.

65 district and the financial impact of the district on local governmental services.
66 Section 19 of this bill authorizes the board of county commissioners that
67 formed a district to issue bonds for the benefit of the district or to enter into an
68 agreement with certain governmental entities or other persons for the cost of
69 acquiring, improving or equipping any project to be performed for the purposes of
70 the district. Section 20 of this bill requires such a board of county commissioners to
71 have an independent auditor review each claim submitted as part of any contract or
72 other agreement made with the board of county commissioners to provide any
73 financing or reimbursement.
74 Section 20.3 of this bill authorizes an owners’ association to submit a request
75 to the board of county commissioners to modify the improvements, activities or the
76 amount of the assessments of the district. Section 20.3 authorizes the board of
77 county commissioners to modify the district by ordinance after holding a public
78 hearing. Additionally, section 20.3 sets forth certain notice requirements for the
79 public hearing. If the proposed modification increases an assessment or adds a new
80 assessment, section 20.3: (1) authorizes any interested person to make a protest
81 orally or in writing; and (2) prohibits the board of county commissioners from
82 modifying a district if the board of county commissioners receives protests from the
83 business owners or authorized representatives of the businesses in the district who
84 will pay more than 50 percent of the total amount of proposed assessments.
85 Section 20.5 authorizes the board of county commissioners to dissolve a
86 district by ordinance if there was a misappropriation of money, malfeasance or a
87 violation of law concerning the management of the district or upon written petition
88 of the business owners or authorized representatives of the businesses in the district
89 who pay 50 percent or more of the assessments. Section 20.5 prescribes
90 requirements for an annual 30-day period in which the business owners or
91 authorized representatives of the businesses may request the dissolution of a district
92 by written petition. Section 20.5 of this bill requires the board of county
93 commissioners to hold a public hearing before dissolving a district and sets forth
94 certain notice requirements for the public hearing.
95 Section 20.7 requires, upon the dissolution or expiration of a district, any
96 remaining revenue to be spent in accordance with the district management plan or
97 returned to the business owners subject to assessment.

42 qualify as a public work.
43 3. If an owners’ association is designated in the district
44 management plan, the owners’ association shall prepare and
45 submit a report to the county clerk not later than the end of each
-

22 with the distribution of benefits from the proposed activities.
23 2. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the
24 revenue from the levy of assessments within a district must not be
25 used to provide activities outside the district or for any purpose
26 other than the purposes specified in the ordinance adopted
27 pursuant to section 15 of this act. Activities that are provided
28 outside the boundaries of a district to create a special or specific
29 benefit may only include marketing or signage.
30 3. The board of county commissioners may:
31 (a) Establish separate benefit zones within the district based on
32 the degree of benefit that each zone will receive from the activities
33 that will be provided in the benefit zone and impose a different

6 county commissioners that adopts an ordinance pursuant to
7 section 15 of this act shall prepare and submit to the Director of
8 the Legislative Counsel Bureau for transmission to
9 the Legislature, or to the Legislative Commission when the
10 Legislature is not in regular session, an annual report containing:

20 (a) Issue, at one time or from time to time, bonds or notes as
21 special obligations under the Local Government Securities Law to
22 finance or refinance projects for the benefit of the district. Any
23 such bonds or notes may be secured by a pledge of, and be payable
24 from, any money pledged pursuant to section 15 of this act and
25 received by the county with respect to the district, any revenue
26 received by the county from any revenue-producing projects in the
27 district or any combination thereof.
28 (b) Enter into an agreement with one or more governmental
29 entities or other persons to reimburse that entity or person for the
30 cost of acquiring, improving or equipping, or any combination
31 thereof, any project to be performed for the purposes of the
32 district, which may contain such terms as are determined to be
33 desirable by the board of county commissioners, including the
34 payment of reasonable interest and other financing costs incurred

37 pursuant to section 15 of this act and received by the county with
38 respect to the district, any revenue received by the county from any
39 revenue-producing projects in the district or any combination
40 thereof. Such an agreement is not subject to the limitations of

42 of county commissioners, be binding on the county beyond the

-
*SB420_R1*

– 12 –

2 will be generated from money pledged pursuant to section 15 of
3 this act to make timely payment on the bonds or notes, taking into
4 account the revenue from any other revenue-producing projects
5 also pledged for the payment of the bonds or notes, if any. A
6 failure to make payments of any amounts due:
7 (a) With respect to any bonds or notes issued pursuant to
8 subsection 1; or
9 (b) Under any agreements entered into pursuant to
10 subsection 1,
11  because of any insufficiency in the amount of money pledged

19 pledged pursuant to section 15 of this act and received by the
20 county with respect to the district, any revenue received by the
21 county from any revenue-producing projects in the district or any
22 combination thereof. No bond, note or agreement issued or
23 entered into pursuant to this section may ever become a general
24 obligation of the county or a charge against its general credit or
25 taxing powers, nor may any such bond, note or agreement become
26 a debt of the county for the purposes of any limitation on
27 indebtedness.
28 4. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, any bond
29 or note issued pursuant to this section, including any bond or note
30 issued to refund any such bond or note, must mature on or before,

17 than 50 percent of the total amount of assessments proposed to be
18 levied.

41 (d) The date, time and location of the public hearing.
42 5. At the conclusion of a public hearing to modify a district,
