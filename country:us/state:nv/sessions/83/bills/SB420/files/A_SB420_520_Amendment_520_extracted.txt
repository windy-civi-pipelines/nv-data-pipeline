4 to section 15 of this act shall prepare and submit to the Director of the Legislative
5 Counsel Bureau for transmission to the Legislature, or to the Legislative
6 Commission when the Legislature is not in regular session, an annual report
7 containing:
8 1. A statement of the status of the activities located or expected to be located
9 in the district, and of any changes in that status since the [prior] previous annual
10 report.
11 2. An assessment of the financial impact of the district on the provision of
12 local governmental services, including, without limitation, services for police
13 protection and fire protection.
14 Sec. 19. 1. Except as otherwise provided in this section, if the [governing
15 body of a municipality] board of county commissioners adopts an ordinance
16 pursuant to section 15 of this act, the [municipality] county may:
17 (a) Issue, at one time or from time to time, bonds or notes as special
18 obligations under the Local Government Securities Law to finance or refinance
19 projects for the benefit of the district. Any such bonds or notes may be secured by
20 a pledge of, and be payable from, any money pledged pursuant to section 15 of
21 this act and received by the [municipality] county with respect to the district, any
22 revenue received by the [municipality] county from any revenue-producing
23 projects in the district or any combination thereof.
24 (b) Enter into an agreement with one or more governmental entities or other
25 persons to reimburse that entity or person for the cost of acquiring, improving or
26 equipping, or any combination thereof, any project to be performed for the
27 purposes of the district, which may contain such terms as are determined to be
28 desirable by the [governing body of the municipality,] board of county
29 commissioners, including the payment of reasonable interest and other financing
30 costs incurred by such entity or other person. Any such reimbursement may be
31 secured by a pledge of, and be payable from, any money pledged pursuant to
32 section 15 of this act and received by the [municipality] county with respect to the
33 district, any revenue received by the [municipality] county from any revenue-
34 producing projects in the district or any combination thereof. Such an agreement
35 is not subject to the limitations of subsection 1 of NRS 354.626 and may, at the
36 option of the [governing body of the municipality,] board of county
37 commissioners, be binding on the [municipality] county beyond the fiscal year in
38 which it was made.
39 2. Before the issuance of any bonds or notes pursuant to this section, the
40 [municipality] county must obtain the results of a feasibility study, commissioned
41 by the [municipality,] county, which shows that a sufficient amount will be
42 generated from money pledged pursuant to section 15 of this act to make timely
43 payment on the bonds or notes, taking into account the revenue from any other
44 revenue-producing projects also pledged for the payment of the bonds or notes, if
45 any. A failure to make payments of any amounts due:
46 (a) With respect to any bonds or notes issued pursuant to subsection 1; or
47 (b) Under any agreements entered into pursuant to subsection 1,
48  because of any insufficiency in the amount of money pledged pursuant to
49 section 15 of this act to make those payments shall be deemed not to constitute a
50 default on those bonds, notes or agreements.
51 3. No bond, note or other agreement issued or entered into pursuant to this
52 section may be secured by or payable from the general fund of the [municipality,]
53 county, the power of the [municipality] county to levy ad valorem property taxes,
Senate Amendment No. 520 to Senate Bill No. 420 Page 12
1 or any source other than any money pledged pursuant to section 15 of this act
2 and received by the [municipality] county with respect to the district, any revenue
3 received by the [municipality] county from any revenue-producing projects in the
4 district or any combination thereof. No bond, note or agreement issued or entered
5 into pursuant to this section may ever become a general obligation of the
6 [municipality] county or a charge against its general credit or taxing powers, nor
7 may any such bond, note or agreement become a debt of the [municipality]
8 county for the purposes of any limitation on indebtedness.
9 4. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, any bond or note issued
10 pursuant to this section, including any bond or note issued to refund any such
11 bond or note, must mature on or before, and any agreement entered into
12 pursuant to this section must automatically terminate on or before, the end of the
13 fiscal year in which the term of the district expires.
14 Sec. 20. The [governing body of the municipality] board of county
15 commissioners shall require the review by an independent auditor of each claim
16 submitted pursuant to any contract or other agreement made with the [governing
17 body of the municipality] board of county commissioners pursuant to section 19
18 of this act to provide any financing or reimbursement.
19 Sec. 20.3. 1. An owners’ association may submit a request to the board of
20 county commissioners to modify the district. The proposed modifications may
21 change the improvements and activities that are funded by the assessments or the
22 amount of the assessments.
23 2. Upon the written request of the owners’ association and after holding a
24 public hearing, the board of county commissioners may modify the district by
25 ordinance. If the modification requested by the owners’ association includes a
26 new or increased assessment, any interested person may make a protest orally or
27 in writing. A written protest:
28 (a) Must be filed with the county clerk at or before the time of the public
29 hearing;
30 (b) May be withdrawn in writing at any time before the conclusion of the

33 the person submitting the protest has an interest and written evidence that the

36 not be counted in determining whether the protests are received from the business
37 owners or authorized representatives of the businesses in the district who will pay
38 more than 50 percent of the total amount of assessments proposed to be levied.
39 3. If protests are received from the business owners or authorized
40 representatives of the businesses in the district who will pay more than 50 percent
41 of the total amount of assessments proposed to be levied by the end of the period
42 to withdraw a protest, the board of county commissioners shall not take any
43 further action to modify a district for a period of 1 year from the date on which
44 the board of county commissioners finds that there are enough protests to satisfy
45 the requirements of this subsection.
46 4. Not less than 30 days before holding the public hearing, the board of
47 county commissioners shall mail a notice of the meeting to each business owner
48 subject to the assessment. The notice must include, without limitation:

Senate Amendment No. 520 to Senate Bill No. 420 Page 13
1 50 percent of the total amount of assessments proposed to be levied, the board of
2 county commissioners will be prohibited pursuant to subsection 3 from modifying
3 the district, if applicable; and
4 (d) The date, time and location of the public hearing.
5 5. At the conclusion of a public hearing to modify a district, the board of
6 county commissioners may adopt, revise, change, reduce or modify the proposed

8 district management plan maintained by the county clerk must be revised to
9 account for the modification.
10 Sec. 20.5. 1. The board of county commissioners may dissolve by
11 ordinance a district pursuant to this section where there is no outstanding and
12 unpaid debt incurred to accomplish the purposes of the district under the
13 following circumstances:
14 (a) If the board of county commissioners finds that there was a
15 misappropriation of money, malfeasance or a violation of law concerning the
16 management of the district; or
17 (b) Upon written petition of the business owners or authorized
18 representatives of the businesses in the district who pay 50 percent or more of the
19 assessments levied pursuant to subsection 2.
20 2. During each year of the operation of the district, there must be a 30-day
21 period in which the business owners or authorized representatives of the
22 businesses in the district may request the dissolution of the district by written
23 petition. The first such period must begin 2 years after the date on which the
24 district is created and each subsequent 30-day period must begin on the
25 anniversary of the day on which the district was created.
26 3. Before the board of county commissioners may dissolve a district, the
27 board of county commissioners shall hold a public hearing. Not less than 30 days
28 before holding the public hearing, the board of county commissioners shall mail
29 a notice of the meeting to each business owner subject to the assessment. The

38 owners subject to the assessment in an amount that is proportionate to the
39 amount of the assessment levied against the business owner.

4 board of county commissioners of certain [municipalities] counties to create a business
5 improvement district to perform certain activities relating to transportation and [housing and
6 mitigating] visitor activities. Section 2 of this bill provides that the provisions of this bill may
7 be referred to as the Business Improvement District Law. Section 3 of this bill provides that
8 the provisions of this bill apply, under certain circumstances, in any region of this State
9 governed by a regional planning agency created by interstate compact (currently the Lake
10 Tahoe Basin). Sections [5-10] 5-10.5 of this bill define certain terms relating to business
11 improvement districts. Section 4 of this bill applies these definitions to the provisions of this
12 bill.
13 Section 11 of this bill authorizes a person to submit a petition to the [governing body of a
14 municipality] board of county commissioners to create a business improvement district.
15 Such a petition is required to: (1) be signed by the business owners in the proposed district
16 who will pay more than 50 percent of the total amount of assessments proposed to be levied in

27 of proposed assessments. Section 14 of this bill authorizes, with certain exceptions, the

29 the proposed assessments or the types of activities to be provided by the proposed district.
30 Section 15 of this bill authorizes the [governing body,] board of county commissioners,

34 overlapping with the boundaries of another district; and (2) the [governing body] board of
35 county commissioners from creating a district in the jurisdiction of another [municipality]
36 county without the consent of the [governing body] board of county commissioners of that
37 [municipality.] county. Additionally, section 15 provides, with certain exceptions, that the
38 term of a district may not exceed 5 years upon the initial formation of the district and an
39 additional 10 years upon renewal. Section 15.3 of this bill authorizes the board of county
40 commissioners to renew a district by following the procedures for establishing a district.
41 Section 15.3 also provides, with certain exceptions, that the term of the district may not

65 that formed a district to issue bonds for the benefit of the district or to enter into an agreement
66 with certain governmental entities or other persons for the cost of acquiring, improving or
67 equipping any project to be performed for the purposes of the district. Section 20 of this bill
68 requires such a [governing body] board of county commissioners to have an independent
69 auditor review each claim submitted as part of any contract or other agreement made with the
70 [governing body] board of county commissioners to provide any financing or
71 reimbursement.
72 Section 20.3 of this bill authorizes an owners’ association to submit a request to the
73 board of county commissioners to modify the improvements, activities or the amount of
74 the assessments of the district. Section 20.3 authorizes the board of county
75 commissioners to modify the district by ordinance after holding a public hearing.
76 Additionally, section 20.3 sets forth certain notice requirements for the public hearing. If
77 the proposed modification increases an assessment or adds a new assessment, section
78 20.3: (1) authorizes any interested person to make a protest orally or in writing; and (2)
79 prohibits the board of county commissioners from modifying a district if the board of
80 county commissioners receives protests from the business owners or authorized
81 representatives of the businesses in the district who will pay more than 50 percent of the
82 total amount of proposed assessments.
83 Section 20.5 authorizes the board of county commissioners to dissolve a district by
84 ordinance if there was a misappropriation of money, malfeasance or a violation of law
85 concerning the management of the district or upon written petition of the business
86 owners or authorized representatives of the businesses in the district who pay 50 percent
87 or more of the assessments. Section 20.5 prescribes requirements for an annual 30-day
88 period in which the business owners or authorized representatives of the businesses may

90 the board of county commissioners to hold a public hearing before dissolving a district
91 and sets forth certain notice requirements for the public hearing.

20 The boundaries of [a] the district [that levies assessments on businesses from
21 overlapping] may overlap with the boundaries of [a] another district [that levies
22 assessments on property.] created pursuant to this chapter if the benefit conferred
23 is different from the benefit conferred by the other district.
24 4. The [governing body of a municipality] board of county commissioners
25 shall not create a district within the jurisdiction of another [municipality] county
26 without the consent of the [governing body] board of county commissioners of the

29 new district is 5 years. Upon renewal, a district may have an additional term not

32 levy assessments until the maximum maturity of the bonds.
33 6. If a district is created by ordinance, the county clerk shall maintain and
34 make available for inspection by the public a copy of the district management
35 plan.
36 Sec. 15.3. 1. Any district whose term has expired or will expire may be
37 renewed by following the procedures to establish a district set forth in this
38 chapter. The boundaries, assessments, improvements or activities of a renewed
39 district may be different from the boundaries, assessments, improvements or
40 activities of the previous district.
41 2. If a district is renewed, any remaining revenues from the levy of
42 assessments or any revenues from the sale of assets acquired with the revenues
43 must be transferred to the renewed district. If a renewed district includes
44 businesses that were not included in the previous district, the remaining revenues
45 must be spent to benefit only the businesses in the previous district. If a renewed
46 district does not include businesses that were included in the previous district, the
47 remaining revenues attributable to such businesses must be spent in accordance
48 with the district management plan of the previous district.
49 3. A renewed district may have a term not to exceed 10 years or until the
50 maximum maturity of the bonds issued by the district.

2 administer or implement the improvements and activities set forth in the district
3 management plan.
4 2. Regardless of whether an owners’ association administers or implements
5 the improvements and activities set forth in the district management plan, the
6 provisions of NRS 338.013 to 338.090, inclusive, apply to any project of the
7 district for an improvement or activity, in the same manner as if a public body
8 had awarded a contract for the project, even if the project does not qualify as a
9 public work.
10 3. If an owners’ association is designated in the district management plan,
11 the owners’ association shall prepare and submit a report to the county clerk not
12 later than the end of each fiscal year for each upcoming fiscal year in which
13 assessments are levied. The first report is due at the end of the first fiscal year in

16 (b) The fiscal year for which the report applies;
17 (c) The improvements and activities that will be provided for the fiscal year

28 benefit to the businesses within the district. The [governing body of the
29 municipality] board of county commissioners shall determine the structure of the
30 assessments to ensure the assessments correspond with the distribution of
31 benefits from the proposed activities.
32 2. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the revenue from the
33 levy of assessments within a district [may] must not be used to provide activities
34 outside the district or for any purpose other than the purposes specified in the
35 ordinance adopted pursuant to section 15 of this act. Activities that are provided
36 outside the boundaries of a district to create a special or specific benefit may only
37 include marketing or signage.
38 3. The [governing body of the municipality] board of county commissioners
39 may:
40 (a) Establish separate benefit zones within the district based on the degree of
41 benefit that each zone will receive from the activities that will be provided in the
42 benefit zone and impose a different assessment within each benefit zone; and
43 (b) Define categories of businesses based on the degree of benefit that each
44 category will receive from the activities that will be provided to each category and

50 agreement specifying the dates and procedures for the distribution to the
51 [municipality] county of any money pledged pursuant to section 15 of this act.

15 body of a municipality] board of county commissioners adopts an ordinance
16 pursuant to section 15 of this act, the [municipality] county may:
17 (a) Issue, at one time or from time to time, bonds or notes as special
18 obligations under the Local Government Securities Law to finance or refinance
19 projects for the benefit of the district. Any such bonds or notes may be secured by
20 a pledge of, and be payable from, any money pledged pursuant to section 15 of
21 this act and received by the [municipality] county with respect to the district, any
22 revenue received by the [municipality] county from any revenue-producing
23 projects in the district or any combination thereof.
24 (b) Enter into an agreement with one or more governmental entities or other
25 persons to reimburse that entity or person for the cost of acquiring, improving or
26 equipping, or any combination thereof, any project to be performed for the
27 purposes of the district, which may contain such terms as are determined to be
28 desirable by the [governing body of the municipality,] board of county
29 commissioners, including the payment of reasonable interest and other financing
30 costs incurred by such entity or other person. Any such reimbursement may be
31 secured by a pledge of, and be payable from, any money pledged pursuant to
32 section 15 of this act and received by the [municipality] county with respect to the
33 district, any revenue received by the [municipality] county from any revenue-
34 producing projects in the district or any combination thereof. Such an agreement
35 is not subject to the limitations of subsection 1 of NRS 354.626 and may, at the
36 option of the [governing body of the municipality,] board of county
37 commissioners, be binding on the [municipality] county beyond the fiscal year in
38 which it was made.
39 2. Before the issuance of any bonds or notes pursuant to this section, the
40 [municipality] county must obtain the results of a feasibility study, commissioned
41 by the [municipality,] county, which shows that a sufficient amount will be
42 generated from money pledged pursuant to section 15 of this act to make timely
43 payment on the bonds or notes, taking into account the revenue from any other
44 revenue-producing projects also pledged for the payment of the bonds or notes, if
45 any. A failure to make payments of any amounts due:
46 (a) With respect to any bonds or notes issued pursuant to subsection 1; or
47 (b) Under any agreements entered into pursuant to subsection 1,
48  because of any insufficiency in the amount of money pledged pursuant to
49 section 15 of this act to make those payments shall be deemed not to constitute a
50 default on those bonds, notes or agreements.

53 county, the power of the [municipality] county to levy ad valorem property taxes,

2 and received by the [municipality] county with respect to the district, any revenue
3 received by the [municipality] county from any revenue-producing projects in the
4 district or any combination thereof. No bond, note or agreement issued or entered
5 into pursuant to this section may ever become a general obligation of the
6 [municipality] county or a charge against its general credit or taxing powers, nor
7 may any such bond, note or agreement become a debt of the [municipality]
8 county for the purposes of any limitation on indebtedness.
9 4. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, any bond or note issued
10 pursuant to this section, including any bond or note issued to refund any such
11 bond or note, must mature on or before, and any agreement entered into
12 pursuant to this section must automatically terminate on or before, the end of the
13 fiscal year in which the term of the district expires.
14 Sec. 20. The [governing body of the municipality] board of county
15 commissioners shall require the review by an independent auditor of each claim

18 of this act to provide any financing or reimbursement.
19 Sec. 20.3. 1. An owners’ association may submit a request to the board of

37 owners or authorized representatives of the businesses in the district who will pay
38 more than 50 percent of the total amount of assessments proposed to be levied.
39 3. If protests are received from the business owners or authorized
40 representatives of the businesses in the district who will pay more than 50 percent
41 of the total amount of assessments proposed to be levied by the end of the period
