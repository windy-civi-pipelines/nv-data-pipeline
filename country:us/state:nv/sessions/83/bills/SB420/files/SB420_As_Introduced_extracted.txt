7 benefit that each category will receive from the activities that will
8 be provided to each category and impose a different assessment or
9 assessment rate within each category of business or each category

11 Sec. 17. After the adoption of an ordinance creating a

13 municipality and the Department of Taxation may enter into an
14 agreement specifying the dates and procedures for the distribution
15 to the municipality of any money pledged pursuant to section 15 of
16 this act. The distributions must:
17 1. Be made not less frequently than once each calendar
18 quarter; and
19 2. Cease at the end of the fiscal year in which the district
20 expires.
21 Sec. 18. On or before September 1 of each year, the
22 governing body of a municipality that adopts an ordinance
23 pursuant to section 15 of this act shall prepare and submit to the
24 Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau for transmission to
25 the Legislature, or to the Legislative Commission when the
26 Legislature is not in regular session, an annual report containing:

36 (a) Issue, at one time or from time to time, bonds or notes as
37 special obligations under the Local Government Securities Law to

39 such bonds or notes may be secured by a pledge of, and be payable
40 from, any money pledged pursuant to section 15 of this act and
41 received by the municipality with respect to the district, any
42 revenue received by the municipality from any revenue-producing
43 projects in the district or any combination thereof.
44 (b) Enter into an agreement with one or more governmental
45 entities or other persons to reimburse that entity or person for the
-
*SB420*
– 9 –
1 cost of acquiring, improving or equipping, or any combination
2 thereof, any project to be performed for the purposes of the
3 district, which may contain such terms as are determined to be
4 desirable by the governing body of the municipality, including the
5 payment of reasonable interest and other financing costs incurred
6 by such entity or other person. Any such reimbursement may be
7 secured by a pledge of, and be payable from, any money pledged
8 pursuant to section 15 of this act and received by the municipality
9 with respect to the district, any revenue received by the
10 municipality from any revenue-producing projects in the district
11 or any combination thereof. Such an agreement is not subject to
12 the limitations of subsection 1 of NRS 354.626 and may, at the
13 option of the governing body of the municipality, be binding on
14 the municipality beyond the fiscal year in which it was made.
15 2. Before the issuance of any bonds or notes pursuant to this
16 section, the municipality must obtain the results of a feasibility
17 study, commissioned by the municipality, which shows that a
18 sufficient amount will be generated from money pledged pursuant
19 to section 15 of this act to make timely payment on the bonds or
20 notes, taking into account the revenue from any other revenue-
21 producing projects also pledged for the payment of the bonds or
22 notes, if any. A failure to make payments of any amounts due:
23 (a) With respect to any bonds or notes issued pursuant to
24 subsection 1; or
25 (b) Under any agreements entered into pursuant to
26 subsection 1,
27  because of any insufficiency in the amount of money pledged
28 pursuant to section 15 of this act to make those payments shall be
29 deemed not to constitute a default on those bonds, notes or
30 agreements.
31 3. No bond, note or other agreement issued or entered into
32 pursuant to this section may be secured by or payable from the
33 general fund of the municipality, the power of the municipality to
34 levy ad valorem property taxes, or any source other than any
35 money pledged pursuant to section 15 of this act and received by
36 the municipality with respect to the district, any revenue received
37 by the municipality from any revenue-producing projects in the
38 district or any combination thereof. No bond, note or agreement
39 issued or entered into pursuant to this section may ever become a
40 general obligation of the municipality or a charge against its
41 general credit or taxing powers, nor may any such bond, note or
42 agreement become a debt of the municipality for the purposes of
43 any limitation on indebtedness.
44 4. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, any bond
45 or note issued pursuant to this section, including any bond or note
-
*SB420*
– 10 –
1 issued to refund any such bond or note, must mature on or before,
2 and any agreement entered into pursuant to this section must
3 automatically terminate on or before, the end of the fiscal year in
4 which the term of the district expires.
5 Sec. 20. The governing body of the municipality shall require
6 the review by an independent auditor of each claim submitted
7 pursuant to any contract or other agreement made with the
8 governing body of the municipality pursuant to section 19 of this
9 act to provide any financing or reimbursement.
10 Sec. 21. The provisions of subsection 1 of NRS 218D.380 do
11 not apply to any provision of this act which adds or revises a
12 requirement to submit a report to the Legislature.

7 benefit that each category will receive from the activities that will
8 be provided to each category and impose a different assessment or
9 assessment rate within each category of business or each category

13 municipality and the Department of Taxation may enter into an
14 agreement specifying the dates and procedures for the distribution
15 to the municipality of any money pledged pursuant to section 15 of
16 this act. The distributions must:
17 1. Be made not less frequently than once each calendar
18 quarter; and
19 2. Cease at the end of the fiscal year in which the district
20 expires.
21 Sec. 18. On or before September 1 of each year, the
22 governing body of a municipality that adopts an ordinance
23 pursuant to section 15 of this act shall prepare and submit to the
24 Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau for transmission to
25 the Legislature, or to the Legislative Commission when the

39 such bonds or notes may be secured by a pledge of, and be payable
40 from, any money pledged pursuant to section 15 of this act and
41 received by the municipality with respect to the district, any
42 revenue received by the municipality from any revenue-producing
43 projects in the district or any combination thereof.
44 (b) Enter into an agreement with one or more governmental
45 entities or other persons to reimburse that entity or person for the
-
*SB420*

– 9 –
1 cost of acquiring, improving or equipping, or any combination
2 thereof, any project to be performed for the purposes of the
3 district, which may contain such terms as are determined to be
4 desirable by the governing body of the municipality, including the
5 payment of reasonable interest and other financing costs incurred
6 by such entity or other person. Any such reimbursement may be
7 secured by a pledge of, and be payable from, any money pledged
8 pursuant to section 15 of this act and received by the municipality
9 with respect to the district, any revenue received by the
10 municipality from any revenue-producing projects in the district
11 or any combination thereof. Such an agreement is not subject to
12 the limitations of subsection 1 of NRS 354.626 and may, at the
13 option of the governing body of the municipality, be binding on
14 the municipality beyond the fiscal year in which it was made.
15 2. Before the issuance of any bonds or notes pursuant to this
16 section, the municipality must obtain the results of a feasibility
17 study, commissioned by the municipality, which shows that a
18 sufficient amount will be generated from money pledged pursuant
19 to section 15 of this act to make timely payment on the bonds or
20 notes, taking into account the revenue from any other revenue-
21 producing projects also pledged for the payment of the bonds or
22 notes, if any. A failure to make payments of any amounts due:
23 (a) With respect to any bonds or notes issued pursuant to
24 subsection 1; or
25 (b) Under any agreements entered into pursuant to
26 subsection 1,
27  because of any insufficiency in the amount of money pledged
28 pursuant to section 15 of this act to make those payments shall be
29 deemed not to constitute a default on those bonds, notes or
30 agreements.
31 3. No bond, note or other agreement issued or entered into
32 pursuant to this section may be secured by or payable from the
33 general fund of the municipality, the power of the municipality to
34 levy ad valorem property taxes, or any source other than any
35 money pledged pursuant to section 15 of this act and received by
36 the municipality with respect to the district, any revenue received
37 by the municipality from any revenue-producing projects in the
38 district or any combination thereof. No bond, note or agreement
39 issued or entered into pursuant to this section may ever become a
40 general obligation of the municipality or a charge against its
41 general credit or taxing powers, nor may any such bond, note or
42 agreement become a debt of the municipality for the purposes of
43 any limitation on indebtedness.
44 4. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, any bond
45 or note issued pursuant to this section, including any bond or note
-
*SB420*

– 10 –
1 issued to refund any such bond or note, must mature on or before,
2 and any agreement entered into pursuant to this section must
3 automatically terminate on or before, the end of the fiscal year in
4 which the term of the district expires.
5 Sec. 20. The governing body of the municipality shall require
6 the review by an independent auditor of each claim submitted
7 pursuant to any contract or other agreement made with the
8 governing body of the municipality pursuant to section 19 of this
9 act to provide any financing or reimbursement.
10 Sec. 21. The provisions of subsection 1 of NRS 218D.380 do
11 not apply to any provision of this act which adds or revises a
12 requirement to submit a report to the Legislature.
