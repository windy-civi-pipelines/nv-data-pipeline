agent to provide a tenant at least one method of paying rent
or any other fee or charge that meets certain requirements;
prohibiting a landlord or his or her agent from charging a
tenant a fee to make a payment through an Internet website or
online portal that exceeds the amount of any fee charged by

use of the website or portal; requiring a written rental
agreement to separately identify any such fee under certain
circumstances; authorizing a tenant to bring a civil action

prohibiting a landlord from collecting certain application
fees; requiring certain references to the amount of rent due
under a rental agreement to be set forth in a certain manner;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law sets forth certain requirements relating to a written rental
agreement and requires any written agreement for the use and occupancy of a
dwelling unit or premises to contain provisions relating to the amount of rent due
and the manner and time of its payment. (NRS 118A.200) Section 5 of this bill
requires that, in each place where a landlord lists the amount of rent due under a
rental agreement and in any reference to the amount of rent due in a written rental
agreement, the rent must be set forth as a single figure representing the maximum
total amount of periodic rent that includes the amount of any mandatory fees to be
charged to the tenant in addition to the base rent. Section 5 prohibits a landlord
from charging a tenant an amount of periodic rent that exceeds the maximum total
amount of rent due under the written rental agreement, as set forth in the manner
required by section 5. Section 5 also authorizes a landlord, under certain
circumstances, to charge a monthly fee in an amount which is equal to the cost for
the electric, natural gas or water service provided in the individual dwelling unit of
the tenant that is not included in the single figure representing the maximum total
amount of periodic rent due, subject to certain requirements. Section 4 of this bill
requires a landlord or his or her agent, upon request, to provide a prospective tenant
with a copy of the written rental agreement, if any, to which the prospective tenant
would be subject if he or she were to become a tenant.

Section 2:
Section 2 of this bill requires a landlord or his or her agent to provide a tenant
at least one method of paying rent or any other fee or charge which does not require
the tenant to: (1) pay any fee or charge for using the method; or (2) provide
information concerning a bank account of the tenant. Section 2 also prohibits a
landlord or his or her agent who allows a tenant to pay rent or any other fee or
charge through an Internet website or online portal from charging the tenant a fee to
-

– 2 –
make a payment through the Internet website or online portal in an amount that
exceeds the amount of any fee charged by the operator of the Internet website or
online portal for the use of the Internet website or online portal. Section 2 requires
the amount of any fee to be charged to the tenant by the landlord or his or her agent
for the use of an Internet website or online portal to make a payment to be
separately identified in any written rental agreement.

Section 3:
Section 4.5 of this bill requires a landlord who collects from a prospective
tenant any fee to apply to rent a dwelling unit to refund the fee if the landlord: (1)
rents the dwelling unit to a different prospective tenant; and (2) does not conduct
the activity for which the fee was collected. Section 4.5 also prohibits a landlord
from collecting an application fee, a fee to obtain a credit report or a fee to obtain a
background check for a minor who is a member of the household of the prospective
tenant.

Section 4:
Section 3 of this bill authorizes a tenant who is aggrieved by a violation of the
requirements of section 5 concerning the manner in which rent must be listed or
referenced in a written rental agreement or the prohibition set forth in section 5 on
charging a tenant an amount of periodic rent that exceeds the amount of rent due
under a written rental agreement to bring a civil action for such a violation. Section
3 requires a court to award certain relief to a tenant who prevails in such an action.

Existing law sets forth certain requirements relating to a written rental
agreement and requires any written agreement for the use and occupancy of a
dwelling unit or premises to contain provisions relating to the amount of rent due
and the manner and time of its payment. (NRS 118A.200) Section 5 of this bill
requires that, in each place where a landlord lists the amount of rent due under a
rental agreement and in any reference to the amount of rent due in a written rental
agreement, the rent must be set forth as a single figure representing the maximum
total amount of periodic rent that includes the amount of any mandatory fees to be
charged to the tenant in addition to the base rent. Section 5 prohibits a landlord
from charging a tenant an amount of periodic rent that exceeds the maximum total
amount of rent due under the written rental agreement, as set forth in the manner
required by section 5. Section 5 also authorizes a landlord, under certain
circumstances, to charge a monthly fee in an amount which is equal to the cost for
the electric, natural gas or water service provided in the individual dwelling unit of
the tenant that is not included in the single figure representing the maximum total
amount of periodic rent due, subject to certain requirements. Section 4 of this bill
requires a landlord or his or her agent, upon request, to provide a prospective tenant
with a copy of the written rental agreement, if any, to which the prospective tenant
would be subject if he or she were to become a tenant.
Section 2 of this bill requires a landlord or his or her agent to provide a tenant
at least one method of paying rent or any other fee or charge which does not require
the tenant to: (1) pay any fee or charge for using the method; or (2) provide
information concerning a bank account of the tenant. Section 2 also prohibits a
landlord or his or her agent who allows a tenant to pay rent or any other fee or
charge through an Internet website or online portal from charging the tenant a fee to

the amount of any fee to be charged to the tenant by the landlord or his or her agent
for the use of an Internet website or online portal to make a payment to be
separately identified in any written rental agreement.
Section 4.5 of this bill requires a landlord who collects from a prospective
tenant any fee to apply to rent a dwelling unit to refund the fee if the landlord: (1)
rents the dwelling unit to a different prospective tenant; and (2) does not conduct
the activity for which the fee was collected. Section 4.5 also prohibits a landlord
from collecting an application fee, a fee to obtain a credit report or a fee to obtain a
background check for a minor who is a member of the household of the prospective
tenant.
Section 3 of this bill authorizes a tenant who is aggrieved by a violation of the
requirements of section 5 concerning the manner in which rent must be listed or
referenced in a written rental agreement or the prohibition set forth in section 5 on
charging a tenant an amount of periodic rent that exceeds the amount of rent due
