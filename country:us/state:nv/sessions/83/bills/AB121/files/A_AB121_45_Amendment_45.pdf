Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth certain requirements relating to a written rental agreement and
2 requires any written agreement for the use and occupancy of a dwelling unit or premises to
3 contain provisions relating to the amount of rent due and the manner and time of its payment.
4 (NRS 118A.200) Section 5 of this bill requires that, in each place where a landlord lists the
5 amount of rent due under a rental agreement and in any reference to the amount of rent due in
6 a written rental agreement, the rent must be set forth as a single figure representing the total
7 amount of periodic rent that includes the amount of any fixed, mandatory fees to be charged to
8 the tenant in addition to the base rent. Section 5 prohibits a landlord from charging a tenant an
9 amount of periodic rent that exceeds the amount of rent due under the written rental
10 agreement, as set forth in the manner required by section 5. Section 4 of this bill requires a
11 landlord or his or her agent, upon request, to provide a prospective tenant with a copy of the
12 written rental agreement, if any, to which the prospective tenant would be subject if he or she
13 were to become a tenant.
14 Section 2 of this bill requires a landlord or his or her agent to provide a tenant at least one
15 method of paying rent or any other fee or charge which does not require the tenant to: (1) pay

Assembly Amendment No. 45 to Assembly Bill No. 121 Page 4
16 any fee or charge for using the method; or (2) provide information concerning a bank account
17 of the tenant. Section 2 also prohibits a landlord or his or her agent who allows a tenant to pay
18 rent or any other fee or charge through an Internet website or online portal from charging the
19 tenant a fee to make a payment through the Internet website or online portal in an amount that
20 exceeds the amount of any fee charged by the operator of the Internet website or online portal
21 for the use of the Internet website or online portal. Section 2 requires the amount of any fee to
22 be charged to the tenant by the landlord or his or her agent for the use of an Internet website or
23 online portal to make a payment to be separately identified in any written rental agreement.
24 Section 4.5 of this bill requires a landlord who collects from a prospective tenant any
25 fee to apply to rent a dwelling unit to refund the fee if the landlord: (1) rents the dwelling
26 unit to a different prospective tenant; and (2) does not conduct the activity for which the
27 fee was collected. Section 4.5 also prohibits a landlord from collecting an application fee,
28 a fee to obtain a credit report or a fee to obtain a background check for a minor who is a
29 member of the household of the prospective tenant.
30 Section 3 of this bill authorizes a tenant who is aggrieved by a violation of the
31 requirements of section 5 concerning the manner in which rent must be listed or referenced in
32 a written rental agreement or the prohibition set forth in section 5 on charging a tenant an
33 amount of periodic rent that exceeds the amount of rent due under a written rental agreement
34 to bring a civil action for such a violation. Section 3 requires a court to award certain relief to
35 a tenant who prevails in such an action.
