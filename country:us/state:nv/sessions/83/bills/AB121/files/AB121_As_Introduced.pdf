10 charging a tenant an amount of periodic rent that exceeds the amount of rent due
11 under the written rental agreement, as set forth in the manner required by section 5.
12 Section 4 of this bill requires a landlord or his or her agent, upon request, to
13 provide a prospective tenant with a copy of the written rental agreement, if any, to
14 which the prospective tenant would be subject if he or she were to become a tenant.
15 Section 2 of this bill requires a landlord or his or her agent to provide a tenant
16 at least one method of paying rent or any other fee or charge which does not require
17 the tenant to: (1) pay any fee or charge for using the method; or (2) provide
18 information concerning a bank account of the tenant. Section 2 also prohibits a
19 landlord or his or her agent who allows a tenant to pay rent or any other fee or
20 charge through an Internet website or online portal from charging the tenant a fee to
21 make a payment through the Internet website or online portal in an amount that
22 exceeds the amount of any fee charged by the operator of the Internet website or
23 online portal for the use of the Internet website or online portal. Section 2 requires
24 the amount of any fee to be charged to the tenant by the landlord or his or her agent
25 for the use of an Internet website or online portal to make a payment to be
26 separately identified in any written rental agreement.
27 Section 3 of this bill authorizes a tenant who is aggrieved by a violation of the
28 requirements of section 5 concerning the manner in which rent must be listed or
29 referenced in a written rental agreement or the prohibition set forth in section 5 on
30 charging a tenant an amount of periodic rent that exceeds the amount of rent due
31 under a written rental agreement to bring a civil action for such a violation. Section
32 3 requires a court to award certain relief to a tenant who prevails in such an action.
