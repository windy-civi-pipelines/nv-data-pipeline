agent to provide a tenant at least one method of paying
rent or any other fee or charge that meets certain
requirements; prohibiting a landlord or his or her agent
from charging a tenant a fee to make a payment through
an Internet website or online portal that exceeds the

prohibiting a landlord from collecting certain application

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth certain requirements relating to a written rental
2 agreement and requires any written agreement for the use and occupancy of a
3 dwelling unit or premises to contain provisions relating to the amount of rent due
4 and the manner and time of its payment. (NRS 118A.200) Section 5 of this bill
5 requires that, in each place where a landlord lists the amount of rent due under a
-
*AB121_R2*
– 2 –
6 rental agreement and in any reference to the amount of rent due in a written rental
7 agreement, the rent must be set forth as a single figure representing the maximum
8 total amount of periodic rent that includes the amount of any mandatory fees to be
9 charged to the tenant in addition to the base rent. Section 5 prohibits a landlord
10 from charging a tenant an amount of periodic rent that exceeds the maximum total
11 amount of rent due under the written rental agreement, as set forth in the manner
12 required by section 5. Section 5 also authorizes a landlord, under certain
13 circumstances, to charge a monthly fee in an amount which is equal to the cost for
14 the electric, natural gas or water service provided in the individual dwelling unit of
15 the tenant that is not included in the single figure representing the maximum total
16 amount of periodic rent due, subject to certain requirements. Section 4 of this bill
17 requires a landlord or his or her agent, upon request, to provide a prospective tenant
18 with a copy of the written rental agreement, if any, to which the prospective tenant
19 would be subject if he or she were to become a tenant.
20 Section 2 of this bill requires a landlord or his or her agent to provide a tenant
21 at least one method of paying rent or any other fee or charge which does not require
22 the tenant to: (1) pay any fee or charge for using the method; or (2) provide
23 information concerning a bank account of the tenant. Section 2 also prohibits a
24 landlord or his or her agent who allows a tenant to pay rent or any other fee or
25 charge through an Internet website or online portal from charging the tenant a fee to
26 make a payment through the Internet website or online portal in an amount that
27 exceeds the amount of any fee charged by the operator of the Internet website or
28 online portal for the use of the Internet website or online portal. Section 2 requires
29 the amount of any fee to be charged to the tenant by the landlord or his or her agent
30 for the use of an Internet website or online portal to make a payment to be
31 separately identified in any written rental agreement.
32 Section 4.5 of this bill requires a landlord who collects from a prospective
33 tenant any fee to apply to rent a dwelling unit to refund the fee if the landlord: (1)
34 rents the dwelling unit to a different prospective tenant; and (2) does not conduct
35 the activity for which the fee was collected. Section 4.5 also prohibits a landlord
36 from collecting an application fee, a fee to obtain a credit report or a fee to obtain a
37 background check for a minor who is a member of the household of the prospective
38 tenant.
39 Section 3 of this bill authorizes a tenant who is aggrieved by a violation of the
40 requirements of section 5 concerning the manner in which rent must be listed or
41 referenced in a written rental agreement or the prohibition set forth in section 5 on
42 charging a tenant an amount of periodic rent that exceeds the amount of rent due
43 under a written rental agreement to bring a civil action for such a violation. Section
44 3 requires a court to award certain relief to a tenant who prevails in such an action.

15 dwelling unit of the tenant;
