Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth certain requirements relating to a written rental agreement and
2 requires any written agreement for the use and occupancy of a dwelling unit or premises to
3 contain provisions relating to the amount of rent due and the manner and time of its payment.
4 (NRS 118A.200) Section 5 of this bill requires that, in each place where a landlord lists the
5 amount of rent due under a rental agreement and in any reference to the amount of rent due in
6 a written rental agreement, the rent must be set forth as a single figure representing the
7 maximum total amount of periodic rent that includes the amount of any [fixed,] mandatory
8 fees to be charged to the tenant in addition to the base rent. Section 5 prohibits a landlord
9 from charging a tenant an amount of periodic rent that exceeds the maximum total amount of
10 rent due under the written rental agreement, as set forth in the manner required by section 5.
11 Section 5 also authorizes a landlord, under certain circumstances, to charge a monthly
12 fee in an amount which is equal to the cost for the electric, natural gas or water service
13 provided in the individual dwelling unit of the tenant that is not included in the single
14 figure representing the maximum total amount of periodic rent due, subject to certain
15 requirements. Section 4 of this bill requires a landlord or his or her agent, upon request, to

Senate Amendment No. 740 to Assembly Bill No. 121 First Reprint Page 4
16 provide a prospective tenant with a copy of the written rental agreement, if any, to which the
17 prospective tenant would be subject if he or she were to become a tenant.
18 Section 2 of this bill requires a landlord or his or her agent to provide a tenant at least one
19 method of paying rent or any other fee or charge which does not require the tenant to: (1) pay
20 any fee or charge for using the method; or (2) provide information concerning a bank account
21 of the tenant. Section 2 also prohibits a landlord or his or her agent who allows a tenant to pay
22 rent or any other fee or charge through an Internet website or online portal from charging the
23 tenant a fee to make a payment through the Internet website or online portal in an amount that
24 exceeds the amount of any fee charged by the operator of the Internet website or online portal
25 for the use of the Internet website or online portal. Section 2 requires the amount of any fee to
26 be charged to the tenant by the landlord or his or her agent for the use of an Internet website or
27 online portal to make a payment to be separately identified in any written rental agreement.
28 Section 4.5 of this bill requires a landlord who collects from a prospective tenant any fee
29 to apply to rent a dwelling unit to refund the fee if the landlord: (1) rents the dwelling unit to a
30 different prospective tenant; and (2) does not conduct the activity for which the fee was
31 collected. Section 4.5 also prohibits a landlord from collecting an application fee, a fee to
32 obtain a credit report or a fee to obtain a background check for a minor who is a member of
33 the household of the prospective tenant.
34 Section 3 of this bill authorizes a tenant who is aggrieved by a violation of the
35 requirements of section 5 concerning the manner in which rent must be listed or referenced in
36 a written rental agreement or the prohibition set forth in section 5 on charging a tenant an
37 amount of periodic rent that exceeds the amount of rent due under a written rental agreement
38 to bring a civil action for such a violation. Section 3 requires a court to award certain relief to
39 a tenant who prevails in such an action.

2 agreement for a single-family residence which is not signed by an authorized agent
3 of the landlord who at the time of signing holds a permit to engage in property
4 management pursuant to chapter 645 of NRS must contain a disclosure at the top of
5 the first page of the agreement, in a font size at least two times larger than any other
6 font size in the agreement, which states that:
7 (a) There are rebuttable presumptions in NRS 205.0813 and 205.0817 that the
8 tenant does not have lawful occupancy of the dwelling unless the agreement:
9 (1) Is notarized or is signed by an authorized agent of the landlord who at

31 reference in a written rental agreement to the amount of rent due under the

33 maximum total amount of periodic rent that includes the amount of any [fixed,]
34 mandatory fees to be charged to the tenant in addition to the base rent.
35 7. [A] Except as otherwise provided in subsection 8, a landlord shall not
36 charge a tenant an amount of periodic rent that exceeds the maximum total

40 equal to the cost for the electric, natural gas or water service provided in the
41 individual dwelling unit of the tenant that is not included in the single figure

53 applicable, provided in the individual dwelling unit of the tenant;

Senate Amendment No. 740 to Assembly Bill No. 121 First Reprint Page 7
1 (II) Contains the name and telephone number of each applicable
2 public utility that is unable to contract directly with the tenant for the electric,
3 natural gas or water service provided in the individual dwelling unit of the
4 tenant; and

6 public utility for the electric, natural gas or water service provided in the
7 individual dwelling unit of the tenant will be charged to the tenant as a monthly
8 fee in an amount which is equal to the cost of the monthly bill separate from the

24 agreement on his or her behalf to use any written agreement which does not
25 conform to the provisions of this section, and any provision in an agreement which
