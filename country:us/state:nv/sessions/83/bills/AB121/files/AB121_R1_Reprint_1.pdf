Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth certain requirements relating to a written rental
2 agreement and requires any written agreement for the use and occupancy of a
3 dwelling unit or premises to contain provisions relating to the amount of rent due
4 and the manner and time of its payment. (NRS 118A.200) Section 5 of this bill
5 requires that, in each place where a landlord lists the amount of rent due under a
-
*AB121_R1*

– 2 –
6 rental agreement and in any reference to the amount of rent due in a written rental
7 agreement, the rent must be set forth as a single figure representing the total amount
8 of periodic rent that includes the amount of any fixed, mandatory fees to be charged
9 to the tenant in addition to the base rent. Section 5 prohibits a landlord from
10 charging a tenant an amount of periodic rent that exceeds the amount of rent due
11 under the written rental agreement, as set forth in the manner required by section 5.
12 Section 4 of this bill requires a landlord or his or her agent, upon request, to
13 provide a prospective tenant with a copy of the written rental agreement, if any, to
14 which the prospective tenant would be subject if he or she were to become a tenant.
15 Section 2 of this bill requires a landlord or his or her agent to provide a tenant
16 at least one method of paying rent or any other fee or charge which does not require
17 the tenant to: (1) pay any fee or charge for using the method; or (2) provide
18 information concerning a bank account of the tenant. Section 2 also prohibits a
19 landlord or his or her agent who allows a tenant to pay rent or any other fee or
20 charge through an Internet website or online portal from charging the tenant a fee to
21 make a payment through the Internet website or online portal in an amount that
22 exceeds the amount of any fee charged by the operator of the Internet website or
23 online portal for the use of the Internet website or online portal. Section 2 requires
24 the amount of any fee to be charged to the tenant by the landlord or his or her agent
25 for the use of an Internet website or online portal to make a payment to be
26 separately identified in any written rental agreement.
27 Section 4.5 of this bill requires a landlord who collects from a prospective
28 tenant any fee to apply to rent a dwelling unit to refund the fee if the landlord: (1)
29 rents the dwelling unit to a different prospective tenant; and (2) does not conduct
30 the activity for which the fee was collected. Section 4.5 also prohibits a landlord
31 from collecting an application fee, a fee to obtain a credit report or a fee to obtain a
32 background check for a minor who is a member of the household of the prospective
33 tenant.
34 Section 3 of this bill authorizes a tenant who is aggrieved by a violation of the
35 requirements of section 5 concerning the manner in which rent must be listed or
36 referenced in a written rental agreement or the prohibition set forth in section 5 on
37 charging a tenant an amount of periodic rent that exceeds the amount of rent due
38 under a written rental agreement to bring a civil action for such a violation. Section
39 3 requires a court to award certain relief to a tenant who prevails in such an action.

*AB121_R1*

– 5 –
1 first page of the agreement, in a font size at least two times larger

3 (a) There are rebuttable presumptions in NRS 205.0813 and
