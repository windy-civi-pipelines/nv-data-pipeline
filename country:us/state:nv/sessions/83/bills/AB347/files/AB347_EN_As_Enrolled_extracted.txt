(a) Any proposed gift or grant is necessary because of an
emergency as defined in NRS 353.263 or for the protection or
preservation of life or property, the Governor shall take reasonable
and proper action to accept it and shall report the action and his or
her reasons for determining that immediate action was necessary to

taken. Action by the Governor pursuant to this paragraph constitutes
acceptance of the gift or grant, and other provisions of this chapter
