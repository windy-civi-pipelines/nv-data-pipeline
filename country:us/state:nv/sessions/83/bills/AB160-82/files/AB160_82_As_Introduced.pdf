Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes certain procedures pursuant to which a person is
2 authorized to petition a court for the sealing of criminal records relating to: (1)
3 convictions for certain offenses; (2) charges against a person that were dismissed or
4 declined for prosecution or for which the person was acquitted; (3) a conviction
5 which has been set aside; and (4) a conviction for an offense that has been
6 decriminalized. Existing law: (1) establishes certain requirements concerning
7 the amount of time that must elapse after a person was convicted or charged before
8 the records relating to the conviction or charge are eligible to be sealed through the
9 filing of such a petition; and (2) sets forth the circumstances under which a court is
10 authorized or required to grant the petition. (NRS 179.245, 179.255, 179.271)
11 Section 1.3 of this bill requires the Records, Communications and Compliance
12 Division of the Department of Public Safety, not later than January 1, 2027, to
13 develop and implement a process to identify each: (1) conviction of a person and
14 each charge against a person that becomes an eligible conviction and eligible
15 charge; and (2) agency of criminal justice or public or private company, agency,
16 officer or other custodian of records that may reasonably be identified as having
17 possession of records relating to an eligible conviction or eligible charge. Section
18 1.3 defines “eligible conviction” and “eligible charge” to mean, in general, certain
19 convictions of or charges against a person after January 1, 2027, if the records
20 relating to the conviction or charge are eligible to be sealed pursuant to the
21 provisions of existing law governing the sealing of records. After the development
22 and implementation of the process of identifying eligible convictions and eligible
23 charges, section 1.3 requires the Division to, each month: (1) identify and compile
24 a list of each conviction or charge that has become an eligible conviction or eligible
25 charge in the immediately preceding month and each person or governmental entity
26 identified as having possession of records relating to those eligible convictions and
27 eligible charges; and (2) transmit the list to the Administrative Office of the Courts
28 to recommend the sealing of the records relating to a listed eligible conviction or
29 eligible charge.
30 Section 1.3 requires the Administrative Office of the Courts, not later than
31 January 1, 2027, to develop and implement a process to review such a list received
32 from the Division and to transmit to every court having jurisdiction each conviction
33 of a person or charge against a person that has become an eligible conviction or
34 eligible charge. Section 1.3 also requires the Administrative Office of the Courts,
35 upon receiving such a list from the Division, to confirm each eligible conviction
36 and eligible charge and notify every court having jurisdiction over the sealing of
37 each eligible conviction or eligible charge. Section 1.3 requires a court that
38 receives such a notification from the Administrative Office of the Courts to then
39 provide notice to the appropriate prosecuting attorney or agency and authorizes the
40 prosecuting attorney or agency to object to the sealing of the records relating to
41 each listed eligible conviction or eligible charge. Section 1.3 further establishes the
42 circumstances in which the court may order the records to be sealed. Section 5 of
43 this bill requires the order to be sent to the persons and governmental entities
44 named in the order, who are then required to seal records relating to the eligible
45 conviction or eligible charge. Section 1.3 also: (1) authorizes the Division and the
46 Administrative Office of the Courts to adopt any rules or regulations, as applicable,
47 that are necessary to carry out the provisions of section 1.3; and (2) requires the
48 Administrative Office of the Courts to submit certain annual reports to the
49 Legislature beginning on January 31, 2028.
50 Existing law provides, in general, that there is a rebuttable presumption that
51 certain records of a person should be sealed if the person petitions the court for the
52 sealing of such records and satisfies all statutory requirements. (NRS 179.2445)
53 Section 3.5 of this bill provides that there is also a rebuttable presumption that
54 certain records of a person should be sealed if a court receives a list of confirmed
-
*AB160_R3*

– 3 –
55 eligible convictions or charges from the Administrative Office of the Courts
56 pursuant to section 1.3 and the records relate to such confirmed eligible convictions
57 or charges. Sections 3.7 and 3.9 of this bill make conforming changes to reflect the
58 change in section 3.5.
59 Existing law provides that if a court seals certain records of a person, certain
60 civil rights of the person are restored. Existing law requires the person to be given
61 documentation demonstrating that fact. If the documentation is lost, damaged or
62 destroyed, the person is authorized to request that a court issue an order to restore
63 his or her civil rights. (NRS 179.285) Section 6 of this bill makes a technical,
64 nonsubstantive change to existing law by reorganizing the language in existing law.
65 Section 6.5 of this bill provides for the restoration of civil rights if the records of a
66 person are sealed pursuant to section 1.3. However, under section 6.5, the person is
67 not required to be given documentation demonstrating that fact. Instead, section 6.5
68 authorizes a person who was not given documentation of the restoration of his or
69 her civil rights to request that a court issue an order in the same manner as a person
70 whose documentation is lost, damaged or destroyed.
71 Section 7 of this bill authorizes a person who is the subject of records that are
72 sealed pursuant to section 1.3 to petition a court to allow for the inspection of the
73 records. Section 8 of this bill authorizes certain other governmental entities to
74 inspect such records under certain circumstances. Section 7.5 of this bill authorizes
75 the Central Repository for Nevada Records of Criminal History and its employees
76 to inspect certain sealed records relating to a violation or alleged violation of the
77 prohibition against certain persons owning or possessing a firearm. (NRS 202.360)
78 Sections 5-7 of this bill also apply provisions relating to records that have been
79 sealed pursuant to certain provisions of law to records that are sealed after a court
80 finds that a person was wrongfully convicted of a felony and enters a certificate of
81 innocence.
82 If a person is arrested and the charges against the person are dismissed or
83 declined for prosecution or the person is acquitted of the charges, existing law
84 authorizes the person to petition a court for the sealing of all records relating to the
85 arrest and the proceedings leading to the dismissal, declination or acquittal. (NRS
86 179.255) Section 4 of this bill authorizes a person against whom multiple charges
87 were brought, consisting of both charges for which the person was convicted and
88 charges which were disposed of by dismissal, declination or acquittal, to petition
89 for the sealing of those portions of the records relating to the arrest of the person
90 and the subsequent proceedings that relate to the charges which were disposed of
91 by dismissal, declination or acquittal.
92 Section 2 of this bill provides that it is the public policy of this State to enhance
93 and modernize the sharing of information between agencies of criminal justice by
94 having records shared in a timely manner in accordance with statutory
95 requirements.
96 Section 1.7 of this bill creates the Advisory Task Force on Automatic Record
97 Sealing and establishes requirements concerning the membership of the Task Force.
98 Section 1.7 establishes the general duties of the Task Force, including reviewing
99 the current petition-based process for the sealing of records and identifying the
100 ways in which the process can be streamlined to simplify the process for
101 petitioners. Section 1.7 also requires the Task Force to prepare and submit a report
102 to the Administrative Office of the Courts and the Legislature: (1) on or before
103 July 1, 2024, that sets forth the initial activities and findings of the Task Force; (2)
104 on or before July 1, 2025, that sets forth the activities, findings and initial
105 recommendations of the Task Force; and (3) on or before July 1, 2026, that sets
106 forth the final activities, findings and recommendations of the Task Force to
107 support the implementation of the automatic sealing of records of criminal history.
108 Section 8.3 of this bill requires the Administrative Office of the Courts, before
-

– 4 –
109 January 1, 2025, to adopt rules to streamline the process for filing a petition for the
110 sealing of records, as recommended by the Task Force.
111 Sections 2-3.3 of this bill make conforming changes to indicate the proper
112 placement of sections 1.3 and 1.7 in the Nevada Revised Statutes.
113 Section 8.1 of this bill makes an appropriation from the State General Fund to
114 the Department of Public Safety for the technology costs associated with complying
115 with the provisions of section 1.3. Section 8.15 of this bill makes an appropriation
116 from the State General Fund to the Department for the provision of support to the
117 Task Force, including for the administrative costs of supporting the Task Force.
118 Section 8.2 of this bill makes an appropriation from the State General Fund to the
119 Interim Finance Committee for allocation to the Department for employing or
120 contracting with persons to perform certain functions and, to the extent that money
121 from the appropriation is available, for the Department to award of grants of money
122 to criminal justice agencies to support technology or system upgrades for the
123 purpose of complying with the provisions of section 1.3.
