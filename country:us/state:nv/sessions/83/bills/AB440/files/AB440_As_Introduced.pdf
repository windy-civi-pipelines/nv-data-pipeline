AN ACT relating to industrial insurance; revising provisions
relating to the testing of certain employees for
tuberculosis, hepatitis and other contagious diseases for
the purpose of compensation under industrial insurance;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the employer of a police officer, firefighter or arson
2 investigator to provide certain testing for tuberculosis, hepatitis and other
3 contagious diseases after the employment of an employee is terminated. Existing
4 law requires the employer to provide: (1) a test to screen for exposure to
5 tuberculosis, at the time of termination and at 3 months after the date of
6 termination; and (2) a blood test or other appropriate test to screen for other
7 contagious diseases, including hepatitis and human immunodeficiency virus, within
8 30 days after the date of termination and at 6 and 12 months after the date of
9 termination. (NRS 616C.052) Section 1 of this bill requires testing for: (1)
10 tuberculosis within 30 days after the date of termination, instead of at the time of
11 termination, and at 3 months after the date of termination; and (2) other contagious
12 diseases within 30 days after the date of termination and at not less than 4 months
13 but not more than 6 months after the date of termination, instead of at 6 and 12
14 months after the date of termination. Section 1 also requires such a blood test or
15 other appropriate test for other contagious diseases to be based on the most recent
16 recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the United
17 States Department of Health and Human Services or the American Medical
18 Association.
19 Existing law requires a person employed as a police officer, firefighter or
20 emergency medical attendant to submit to certain testing for various strains of
21 hepatitis and other diseases or conditions associated with hepatitis, depending on
22 the employer of the person. (NRS 617.485, 617.487) Sections 2 and 3 of this bill
23 require any blood test or other appropriate test for hepatitis or other associated
24 diseases or conditions to be based on the most recent recommendations of the
