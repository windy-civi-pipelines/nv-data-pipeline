authorized to act on behalf of the applicant, to sign the statement under the pains
and penalties of perjury. Existing law provides that a person who signs such a
statement knowing that the application contains information which is false, whether
in whole or in part, and whether by commission or omission, is guilty of a category

submitted to participate in Medicaid as a provider be accompanied by verification
of the identity and signature of the person who signed the statement. This bill

by: (1) oath or affirmation before a notary public or other person authorized by law
to administer oaths or affirmations; or (2) through the use of an electronic identity
verification system.
