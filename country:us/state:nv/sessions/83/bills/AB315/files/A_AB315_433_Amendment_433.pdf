4 applicant, to sign the [application] statement under the pains and penalties of perjury.
5 Existing law provides that a person who signs such [an application] a statement knowing that
6 the application contains information which is false, whether in whole or in part, and whether
7 by commission or omission, is guilty of a category D felony. (NRS 422.550) This bill
8 additionally requires that an application submitted [by a person] to participate in Medicaid as
9 a provider be [notarized, in addition to being signed under the pains and penalties of perjury
10 and containing the required statement that all matters stated within the application are true and
11 accurate.] accompanied by verification of the identity and signature of the person who
12 signed the statement. This bill specifies that a person may verify his or her identity and
13 signature for this purpose by: (1) oath or affirmation before a notary public or other
14 person authorized by law to administer oaths or affirmations; or (2) through the use of
15 an electronic identity verification system.
