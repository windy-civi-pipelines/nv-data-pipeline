EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to limousines; authorizing the holder of a
certificate of public convenience and necessity to operate
a limousine in certain counties to lease a limousine to an
independent contractor; requiring that a lease agreement
be entered into between such a limousine operator and the
independent contractor; imposing certain requirements
and restrictions on the operator, the independent
contractor and the Nevada Transportation Authority with
respect to such leases; providing a penalty; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, in a county whose population is 700,000 or more (currently
2 only Clark County), a person who holds a certificate of public convenience and
3 necessity issued by the Nevada Transportation Authority to operate a taxicab may
4 lease a taxicab to an independent contractor. The independent contractor may
5 operate the taxicab: (1) as a taxicab to the extent authorized by the certificate
6 holder’s certificate; and (2) to provide transportation services under an agreement
7 with a transportation network company. (NRS 706.473, 706.88396) Section 1 of
8 this bill authorizes, in a county whose population is 700,000 or more, an operator of
9 a limousine who holds a certificate to similarly lease the limousine, under certain
10 circumstances, to an independent contractor who may operate the limousine as a
11 limousine to the extent of the authority of the certificate holder. Section 1 imposes
12 certain requirements and restrictions upon the certificate holder, the independent
13 contractor and the Authority with respect to such leases.
14 Existing law requires an operator of a limousine to collect and remit to the
15 Authority a technology fee in an amount set by the Authority for each compensable
16 trip by the limousine if a computerized real-time data system is used for the
17 purposes of offering cooperative dispatch and electronic hailing services to the
-

– 2 –
18 public. (NRS 706.165, 706.465) Sections 1 and 4 of this bill require an
19 independent contractor operating a limousine to also collect and remit to the
20 Authority the technology fee for compensable trips by the limousine leased by the
21 independent contractor. Under existing law, if the Department of Motor Vehicles is
22 not satisfied with the records or statements of, or with the amount of fees paid by,
23 any person pursuant to the provisions of existing law governing the regulation and
24 licensing of motor carriers, the Department is authorized to make an additional or
25 estimated assessment of fees due based upon any information available to the
26 Department. (NRS 706.791) Section 9 of this bill authorizes the Department to
27 impose such an assessment on an independent contractor concerning the payment
28 of the technology fees required by section 1.
29 Section 2 of this bill applies the definitions set forth in existing law governing
30 the regulation and licensing of motor carriers to section 1. Section 3 of this bill
31 exempts a lessee of a limousine pursuant to section 1 from the requirements
32 imposed on operators set forth in the provisions of existing law governing the
33 regulation and licensing of motor carriers. Section 5 of this bill requires the
34 Authority to adopt certain regulations relating to section 1. Section 6 of this bill
35 exempts certain persons from the requirements and restrictions prescribed by
36 section 1.
37 Section 7 of this bill makes a violation of section 1 a misdemeanor. Section 8
38 of this bill grants the Authority and the Department the power to enforce the
39 requirements and restrictions prescribed by section 1 using court orders and fines.

independent contractor; imposing certain requirements
and restrictions on the operator, the independent
contractor and the Nevada Transportation Authority with
respect to such leases; providing a penalty; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, in a county whose population is 700,000 or more (currently
2 only Clark County), a person who holds a certificate of public convenience and
3 necessity issued by the Nevada Transportation Authority to operate a taxicab may
4 lease a taxicab to an independent contractor. The independent contractor may
5 operate the taxicab: (1) as a taxicab to the extent authorized by the certificate
6 holder’s certificate; and (2) to provide transportation services under an agreement
7 with a transportation network company. (NRS 706.473, 706.88396) Section 1 of
8 this bill authorizes, in a county whose population is 700,000 or more, an operator of
9 a limousine who holds a certificate to similarly lease the limousine, under certain
10 circumstances, to an independent contractor who may operate the limousine as a
11 limousine to the extent of the authority of the certificate holder. Section 1 imposes
12 certain requirements and restrictions upon the certificate holder, the independent
13 contractor and the Authority with respect to such leases.
14 Existing law requires an operator of a limousine to collect and remit to the
15 Authority a technology fee in an amount set by the Authority for each compensable
16 trip by the limousine if a computerized real-time data system is used for the
17 purposes of offering cooperative dispatch and electronic hailing services to the
-

– 2 –
18 public. (NRS 706.165, 706.465) Sections 1 and 4 of this bill require an
19 independent contractor operating a limousine to also collect and remit to the
20 Authority the technology fee for compensable trips by the limousine leased by the
21 independent contractor. Under existing law, if the Department of Motor Vehicles is
22 not satisfied with the records or statements of, or with the amount of fees paid by,
23 any person pursuant to the provisions of existing law governing the regulation and
24 licensing of motor carriers, the Department is authorized to make an additional or
25 estimated assessment of fees due based upon any information available to the
26 Department. (NRS 706.791) Section 9 of this bill authorizes the Department to
27 impose such an assessment on an independent contractor concerning the payment
28 of the technology fees required by section 1.
29 Section 2 of this bill applies the definitions set forth in existing law governing
30 the regulation and licensing of motor carriers to section 1. Section 3 of this bill
31 exempts a lessee of a limousine pursuant to section 1 from the requirements
32 imposed on operators set forth in the provisions of existing law governing the
33 regulation and licensing of motor carriers. Section 5 of this bill requires the
34 Authority to adopt certain regulations relating to section 1. Section 6 of this bill
35 exempts certain persons from the requirements and restrictions prescribed by
36 section 1.
37 Section 7 of this bill makes a violation of section 1 a misdemeanor. Section 8
38 of this bill grants the Authority and the Department the power to enforce the
39 requirements and restrictions prescribed by section 1 using court orders and fines.
