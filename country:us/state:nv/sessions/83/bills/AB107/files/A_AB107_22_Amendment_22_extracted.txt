SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to foster care. (BDR 38-339)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to foster care; removing the requirement that a background
investigation of certain persons affiliated with a foster home include
certain violations relating to controlled substances; authorizing a
person who has been convicted of such a violation to operate, be
employed by, reside in or be present in a foster home; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 In order to conduct a foster home, existing law requires a person to obtain a license from:
2 (1) in a county whose population is 100,000 or more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties),
3 the agency which provides child welfare services; or (2) in a county whose population is less
4 than 100,000 (currently all counties other than Clark and Washoe Counties), the Division of
5 Child and Family Services of the Department of Health and Human Services. (NRS 424.016,
6 424.030) Existing law requires the licensing authority or its designee, at certain times, to
7 conduct a background investigation of each applicant for a license to conduct a foster home,
8 person who is licensed to conduct a foster home, employee of such an applicant or licensee
9 and certain adult residents of a foster home to determine whether the applicant, licensee,
10 employee or resident has been arrested for, has charges pending for or has been convicted of
11 certain crimes. Such crimes include violations of any federal or state law regulating the
12 possession, distribution or use of any controlled substance or dangerous drug. (NRS 424.031)
13 Existing law requires an applicant for a license to conduct a foster home or the holder of such
14 a license to terminate the employment, residence or presence in the foster home of a person
15 who has been convicted of such a crime. (NRS 424.0335) Existing law also authorizes a
16 licensing authority to deny an application for a license to operate a foster home or to suspend
17 or revoke such a license if the licensing authority determines that the applicant or licensee has:
18 (1) been convicted of such a crime; or (2) failed to terminate the employment, residence or
19 presence in the foster home of a person who has been convicted of such a crime. (NRS
20 424.033) This bill exempts from those provisions certain violations relating to the possession
21 of controlled substances that [: (1) have been decriminalized under laws of this State; or (2)]
22 involve the unlawful possession of marijuana for a purpose other than sale if the violation did
23 not occur within the immediately preceding [7] 5 years. This bill thereby authorizes a person
24 who has been convicted of any such violation to operate, be employed by, reside in or be
25 present in a foster home.
