AN ACT relating to foster care; removing the requirement that a
background investigation of certain persons affiliated with
a foster home include certain violations relating to
controlled substances; authorizing a person who has been
convicted of such a violation to operate, be employed by,
reside in or be present in a foster home; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 In order to conduct a foster home, existing law requires a person to obtain a
2 license from: (1) in a county whose population is 100,000 or more (currently Clark
3 and Washoe Counties), the agency which provides child welfare services; or (2) in
4 a county whose population is less than 100,000 (currently all counties other than
5 Clark and Washoe Counties), the Division of Child and Family Services of the
6 Department of Health and Human Services. (NRS 424.016, 424.030) Existing law
7 requires the licensing authority or its designee, at certain times, to conduct a
8 background investigation of each applicant for a license to conduct a foster home,
9 person who is licensed to conduct a foster home, employee of such an applicant or
10 licensee and certain adult residents of a foster home to determine whether the
11 applicant, licensee, employee or resident has been arrested for, has charges pending
12 for or has been convicted of certain crimes. Such crimes include violations of any
13 federal or state law regulating the possession, distribution or use of any controlled
14 substance or dangerous drug. (NRS 424.031) Existing law requires an applicant for
15 a license to conduct a foster home or the holder of such a license to terminate the
16 employment, residence or presence in the foster home of a person who has been
17 convicted of such a crime. (NRS 424.0335) Existing law also authorizes a licensing
18 authority to deny an application for a license to operate a foster home or to suspend
19 or revoke such a license if the licensing authority determines that the applicant or
20 licensee has: (1) been convicted of such a crime; or (2) failed to terminate the
-
*AB107_R1*
– 2 –
21 employment, residence or presence in the foster home of a person who has been
22 convicted of such a crime. (NRS 424.033) This bill exempts from those provisions
23 certain violations relating to the possession of controlled substances that involve the
24 unlawful possession of marijuana for a purpose other than sale if the violation did
25 not occur within the immediately preceding 5 years. This bill thereby authorizes a
26 person who has been convicted of any such violation to operate, be employed by,
27 reside in or be present in a foster home.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 424.031 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 424.031 1. The licensing authority or a person or entity

7 that applicant or licensee, and resident of a foster home who is 18
8 years of age or older, other than a resident who remains under the
9 jurisdiction of a court pursuant to NRS 432B.594, to determine
