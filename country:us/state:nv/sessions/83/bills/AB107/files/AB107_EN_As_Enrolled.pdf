Assembly Bill No. 107–Assemblymembers
Brown-May; González and Gray
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to foster care; removing the requirement that a
background investigation of certain persons affiliated with a
foster home include certain violations relating to controlled
substances; authorizing a person who has been convicted of
such a violation to operate, be employed by, reside in or be
present in a foster home; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
In order to conduct a foster home, existing law requires a person to obtain a
license from: (1) in a county whose population is 100,000 or more (currently Clark
and Washoe Counties), the agency which provides child welfare services; or (2) in
a county whose population is less than 100,000 (currently all counties other than
Clark and Washoe Counties), the Division of Child and Family Services of the
Department of Health and Human Services. (NRS 424.016, 424.030) Existing law
requires the licensing authority or its designee, at certain times, to conduct a
background investigation of each applicant for a license to conduct a foster home,
person who is licensed to conduct a foster home, employee of such an applicant or
licensee and certain adult residents of a foster home to determine whether the
applicant, licensee, employee or resident has been arrested for, has charges pending
for or has been convicted of certain crimes. Such crimes include violations of any
federal or state law regulating the possession, distribution or use of any controlled
substance or dangerous drug. (NRS 424.031) Existing law requires an applicant for
a license to conduct a foster home or the holder of such a license to terminate the
employment, residence or presence in the foster home of a person who has been
convicted of such a crime. (NRS 424.0335) Existing law also authorizes a licensing
authority to deny an application for a license to operate a foster home or to suspend
or revoke such a license if the licensing authority determines that the applicant or
licensee has: (1) been convicted of such a crime; or (2) failed to terminate the
employment, residence or presence in the foster home of a person who has been
convicted of such a crime. (NRS 424.033) This bill exempts from those provisions
certain violations relating to the possession of controlled substances that involve the
unlawful possession of marijuana for a purpose other than sale if the violation did
not occur within the immediately preceding 5 years. This bill thereby authorizes a
person who has been convicted of any such violation to operate, be employed by,
reside in or be present in a foster home.
