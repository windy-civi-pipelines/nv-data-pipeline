whom a court orders restitution to apply for compensation
from the Fund; requiring the Administrator of the Securities
Division of the Office of the Secretary of State to review
applications for and award compensation from the Fund;
making confidential certain information; requiring the
Division to adopt regulations relating to the administration of

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law establishes the Uniform Securities Act, which sets forth provisions
governing the sale and purchase of securities in this State in a manner consistent
with federal laws and regulations. In general, the Act prohibits a person from
engaging in certain deceptive acts, practices or courses of business in connection
with the offer, sale or purchase of a security. (NRS 90.570-90.610) The Act also
authorizes certain sanctions against a person who violates these prohibitions,
including civil penalties, criminal fines and payment of restitution. (NRS 90.630-
90.650) The Nevada Constitution entitles a victim of a crime to full and timely
restitution and requires all monetary payments, money and property collected from
any person ordered to make restitution to be first applied to pay the amounts
ordered as restitution to the victim. (Nev. Const. Art. 1, § 8A)
Section 6 of this bill creates the Fund for the Compensation of Victims of
Securities Fraud and requires that the money in the Fund be used for the
compensation of certain victims to whom restitution is owed. Section 2 of this bill
defines the term “Fund” to mean the Fund for the Compensation of Victims of
Securities Fraud. Section 3 of this bill: (1) establishes the process by which certain
persons to whom a court orders restitution may apply for and receive compensation
from the Fund; (2) authorizes an applicant to appeal a determination made
concerning an award of compensation from the Fund; and (3) makes confidential
certain information and documentation submitted in connection with such an
application. Section 11 of this bill makes a conforming change relating to the
information made confidential pursuant to section 3.
Section 4 of this bill requires the Securities Division of the Office of the
Secretary of State to adopt certain regulations relating to the Fund, including
regulations: (1) establishing eligibility requirements for an award of compensation
from the Fund; (2) prescribing certain other requirements relating to the award of
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 2 –
compensation from the Fund; and (3) establishing a procedure to appeal a
determination made concerning an award of compensation from the Fund. Section
5 of this bill requires the Administrator of the Division to prepare and submit a
biennial report to the Legislature that includes certain information relating to the
Fund. Section 6 requires the Division to prepare certain quarterly estimates
concerning the Fund and requires any money remaining in the Fund at the end of
each fiscal year to be carried forward to the next fiscal year. Section 7 of this bill:
(1) requires an applicant, as a condition of accepting an award of compensation
from the Fund, to take certain action if the applicant recovers unpaid restitution
after receiving such compensation; and (2) prescribes certain other conditions of
accepting an award of compensation from the Fund.
Existing law requires all money received by the Division or the Administrator
pursuant to the Act to be deposited in the State General Fund. (NRS 90.630,
90.650, 90.710) Section 10 of this bill establishes certain exceptions to this
requirement and instead requires the following to be deposited in the Fund for the
Compensation of Victims of Securities Fraud: (1) certain gifts, grants and donations
applied for and accepted by the Division; (2) interest and income earned on money
in the Fund for the Compensation of Victims of Securities Fraud; and (3) money
paid to the Division under right of subrogation for certain recoveries for unpaid
restitution obtained by applicants who have received awards of compensation from
the Fund for the Compensation of Victims of Securities Fraud.
Existing law: (1) prohibits a person from offering to sell or selling any security
in this State unless the security meets certain registration requirements; (2) exempts
certain securities and certain transactions from the registration requirements under
certain circumstances; and (3) authorizes the Administrator to disallow certain
exemptions under certain circumstances. (NRS 90.460, 90.520, 90.530) Sections 8
and 9 of this bill remove a requirement that the Administrator disallow certain
exemptions by order, thereby authorizing the Administrator to disallow any such
exemption without issuing an order.
