AN ACT relating to securities; creating the Fund for the Compensation of Victims
of Securities Fraud and prescribing the use of money in the Fund;
authorizing certain persons to whom a court orders restitution to apply
for compensation from the Fund; requiring the Administrator of the
Securities Division of the Office of the Secretary of State to review
applications for and award compensation from the Fund; making
confidential certain information; requiring the Division to adopt
regulations relating to the administration of the Fund; requiring the
Administrator to submit to the Legislature a biennial report concerning
the Fund; requiring a person who receives compensation from the Fund
to reimburse the State for such compensation under certain
circumstances; revising provisions relating to certain exempt securities
and exempt transactions; revising provisions governing the deposit of
certain money received by the Division or the Administrator; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes the Uniform Securities Act, which sets forth provisions
2 governing the sale and purchase of securities in this State in a manner consistent with federal
3 laws and regulations. In general, the Act prohibits a person from engaging in certain deceptive
4 acts, practices or courses of business in connection with the offer, sale or purchase of a
5 security. (NRS 90.570-90.610) The Act also authorizes certain sanctions against a person who
6 violates these prohibitions, including civil penalties, criminal fines and payment of restitution.
7 (NRS 90.630-90.650) The Nevada Constitution entitles a victim of a crime to full and timely
8 restitution and requires all monetary payments, money and property collected from any person
9 ordered to make restitution to be first applied to pay the amounts ordered as restitution to the
10 victim. (Nev. Const. Art. 1, § 8A)
11 Section 6 of this bill creates the Fund for the Compensation of Victims of Securities
12 Fraud and requires that the money in the Fund be used for the compensation of certain victims
13 to whom restitution is owed. Section 2 of this bill defines the term “Fund” to mean the Fund
14 for the Compensation of Victims of Securities Fraud. Section 3 of this bill: (1) establishes the
15 process by which certain persons to whom a court orders restitution may apply for and receive
Senate Amendment No. 801 to Senate Bill No. 76 First Reprint Page 4
16 compensation from the Fund; (2) authorizes an applicant to appeal a determination made
17 concerning an award of compensation from the Fund; and (3) makes confidential certain
18 information and documentation submitted in connection with such an application. Section 11
19 of this bill makes a conforming change relating to the information made confidential pursuant
20 to section 3.
21 Section 4 of this bill requires the Securities Division of the Office of the Secretary of
22 State to adopt certain regulations relating to the Fund, including regulations: (1) establishing
23 eligibility requirements for an award of compensation from the Fund; (2) prescribing certain
24 other requirements relating to the award of compensation from the Fund; and (3) establishing
25 a procedure to appeal a determination made concerning an award of compensation from the
26 Fund. Section 5 of this bill requires the Administrator of the Division to prepare and submit a
27 biennial report to the Legislature that includes certain information relating to the Fund.
28 Section 6 requires the Division to prepare certain quarterly estimates concerning the Fund and
29 requires any money remaining in the Fund at the end of each fiscal year to be carried forward
30 to the next fiscal year. Section 7 of this bill: (1) requires an applicant, as a condition of
31 accepting an award of compensation from the Fund, to take certain action if the applicant
32 recovers unpaid restitution after receiving such compensation; and (2) prescribes certain other
33 conditions of accepting an award of compensation from the Fund.
34 Existing law requires all money received by the Division or the Administrator pursuant to
35 the Act to be deposited in the State General Fund. (NRS 90.630, 90.650, 90.710) Section 10
36 of this bill [requires not more than $500,000 of the money received by the Administrator each
37 fiscal year as a result of an enforcement action relating to securities] establishes certain
38 exceptions to this requirement and instead requires the following to be deposited [with the
39 State Treasurer for credit to] in the Fund [.] for the Compensation of Victims of Securities
40 Fraud: (1) certain gifts, grants and donations applied for and accepted by the Division;
41 (2) interest and income earned on money in the Fund for the Compensation of Victims of
42 Securities Fraud; and (3) money paid to the Division under right of subrogation for
43 certain recoveries for unpaid restitution obtained by applicants who have received
44 awards of compensation from the Fund for the Compensation of Victims of Securities
45 Fraud.
46 Existing law: (1) prohibits a person from offering to sell or selling any security in this
47 State unless the security meets certain registration requirements; (2) exempts certain securities
48 and certain transactions from the registration requirements under certain circumstances; and
49 (3) authorizes the Administrator to disallow certain exemptions under certain circumstances.
50 (NRS 90.460, 90.520, 90.530) Sections 8 and 9 of this bill remove a requirement that the
51 Administrator disallow certain exemptions by order, thereby authorizing the Administrator to
52 disallow any such exemption without issuing an order.

29 710.159, 711.600, and section 3 of this act, sections 35, 38 and 41 of chapter 478,
30 Statutes of Nevada 2011 and section 2 of chapter 391, Statutes of Nevada 2013 and
31 unless otherwise declared by law to be confidential, all public books and public
32 records of a governmental entity must be open at all times during office hours to
33 inspection by any person, and may be fully copied or an abstract or memorandum
34 may be prepared from those public books and public records. Any such copies,
35 abstracts or memoranda may be used to supply the general public with copies,
36 abstracts or memoranda of the records or may be used in any other way to the
37 advantage of the governmental entity or of the general public. This section does not
38 supersede or in any manner affect the federal laws governing copyrights or enlarge,
39 diminish or affect in any other manner the rights of a person in any written book or
40 record which is copyrighted pursuant to federal law.
41 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record which is
42 copyrighted solely because it is copyrighted.
43 3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a public book or
44 record shall not deny a request made pursuant to subsection 1 to inspect or copy or
45 receive a copy of a public book or record on the basis that the requested public
46 book or record contains information that is confidential if the governmental entity
47 can redact, delete, conceal or separate, including, without limitation, electronically,
48 the confidential information from the information included in the public book or
49 record that is not otherwise confidential.
50 4. If requested, a governmental entity shall provide a copy of a public record
51 in an electronic format by means of an electronic medium. Nothing in this
52 subsection requires a governmental entity to provide a copy of a public record in an
53 electronic format or by means of an electronic medium if:
Senate Amendment No. 801 to Senate Bill No. 76 First Reprint Page 15
1 (a) The public record:
2 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
3 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
4 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by means of an
5 electronic medium would:
6 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
7 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential and that
8 cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from information that is not
9 otherwise confidential.
10 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who has legal
11 custody or control of a public record:
12 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the medium that
13 is requested because the officer, employee or agent has already prepared or would
14 prefer to provide the copy in a different medium.
15 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon request, prepare
16 the copy of the public record and shall not require the person who has requested the
17 copy to prepare the copy himself or herself.
18 Sec. 12. The provisions of subsection 1 of NRS 218D.380 do not apply to
19 any provision of this act which adds or revises a requirement to submit a report to
20 the Legislature.
21 Sec. 13. 1. This section becomes effective upon passage and approval.
22 2. Sections 1 to 12, inclusive, of this act become effective:
23 (a) Upon passage and approval for the purpose of adopting any regulations and
24 performing any other preparatory administrative tasks that are necessary to carry
25 out the provisions of this act; and
26 (b) On January 1, 2026, for all other purposes.

~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to securities; creating the Fund for the Compensation of Victims
of Securities Fraud and prescribing the use of money in the Fund;
authorizing certain persons to whom a court orders restitution to apply
for compensation from the Fund; requiring the Administrator of the
Securities Division of the Office of the Secretary of State to review
applications for and award compensation from the Fund; making
confidential certain information; requiring the Division to adopt
regulations relating to the administration of the Fund; requiring the
Administrator to submit to the Legislature a biennial report concerning
the Fund; requiring a person who receives compensation from the Fund
to reimburse the State for such compensation under certain
circumstances; revising provisions relating to certain exempt securities
and exempt transactions; revising provisions governing the deposit of
certain money received by the Division or the Administrator; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes the Uniform Securities Act, which sets forth provisions
2 governing the sale and purchase of securities in this State in a manner consistent with federal
3 laws and regulations. In general, the Act prohibits a person from engaging in certain deceptive
4 acts, practices or courses of business in connection with the offer, sale or purchase of a
5 security. (NRS 90.570-90.610) The Act also authorizes certain sanctions against a person who
6 violates these prohibitions, including civil penalties, criminal fines and payment of restitution.
7 (NRS 90.630-90.650) The Nevada Constitution entitles a victim of a crime to full and timely
8 restitution and requires all monetary payments, money and property collected from any person
9 ordered to make restitution to be first applied to pay the amounts ordered as restitution to the
10 victim. (Nev. Const. Art. 1, § 8A)
11 Section 6 of this bill creates the Fund for the Compensation of Victims of Securities
12 Fraud and requires that the money in the Fund be used for the compensation of certain victims
13 to whom restitution is owed. Section 2 of this bill defines the term “Fund” to mean the Fund
14 for the Compensation of Victims of Securities Fraud. Section 3 of this bill: (1) establishes the
15 process by which certain persons to whom a court orders restitution may apply for and receive

Senate Amendment No. 801 to Senate Bill No. 76 First Reprint Page 4
16 compensation from the Fund; (2) authorizes an applicant to appeal a determination made
17 concerning an award of compensation from the Fund; and (3) makes confidential certain
18 information and documentation submitted in connection with such an application. Section 11
19 of this bill makes a conforming change relating to the information made confidential pursuant
20 to section 3.
21 Section 4 of this bill requires the Securities Division of the Office of the Secretary of
22 State to adopt certain regulations relating to the Fund, including regulations: (1) establishing
23 eligibility requirements for an award of compensation from the Fund; (2) prescribing certain
24 other requirements relating to the award of compensation from the Fund; and (3) establishing
25 a procedure to appeal a determination made concerning an award of compensation from the
26 Fund. Section 5 of this bill requires the Administrator of the Division to prepare and submit a
27 biennial report to the Legislature that includes certain information relating to the Fund.
28 Section 6 requires the Division to prepare certain quarterly estimates concerning the Fund and
29 requires any money remaining in the Fund at the end of each fiscal year to be carried forward
30 to the next fiscal year. Section 7 of this bill: (1) requires an applicant, as a condition of
31 accepting an award of compensation from the Fund, to take certain action if the applicant
32 recovers unpaid restitution after receiving such compensation; and (2) prescribes certain other
33 conditions of accepting an award of compensation from the Fund.
34 Existing law requires all money received by the Division or the Administrator pursuant to
35 the Act to be deposited in the State General Fund. (NRS 90.630, 90.650, 90.710) Section 10
36 of this bill [requires not more than $500,000 of the money received by the Administrator each
37 fiscal year as a result of an enforcement action relating to securities] establishes certain
38 exceptions to this requirement and instead requires the following to be deposited [with the
39 State Treasurer for credit to] in the Fund [.] for the Compensation of Victims of Securities
40 Fraud: (1) certain gifts, grants and donations applied for and accepted by the Division;
41 (2) interest and income earned on money in the Fund for the Compensation of Victims of
42 Securities Fraud; and (3) money paid to the Division under right of subrogation for
43 certain recoveries for unpaid restitution obtained by applicants who have received
44 awards of compensation from the Fund for the Compensation of Victims of Securities
45 Fraud.
46 Existing law: (1) prohibits a person from offering to sell or selling any security in this
47 State unless the security meets certain registration requirements; (2) exempts certain securities
48 and certain transactions from the registration requirements under certain circumstances; and
49 (3) authorizes the Administrator to disallow certain exemptions under certain circumstances.
50 (NRS 90.460, 90.520, 90.530) Sections 8 and 9 of this bill remove a requirement that the
51 Administrator disallow certain exemptions by order, thereby authorizing the Administrator to
52 disallow any such exemption without issuing an order.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

28 3. Establishing the order of priority in which the Administrator or his or
29 her designee must:

31 (b) Award compensation to an applicant, if applicable.
32 4. Prescribing standards for the amount of compensation the Administrator
33 or his or her designee may award from the Fund. Such standards must include,
34 without limitation, a requirement that such compensation must not exceed the

36 restitution awarded by a court.
37 5. Establishing a procedure to appeal a determination made by the
38 Administrator or his or her designee pursuant to section 3 of this act.

18 subrogation may be diminished for attorney’s fees and other costs of litigation in
19 obtaining such recovery; and
20 2. If recovery is obtained for unpaid restitution, the applicant shall promptly
21 notify the Administrator or his or her designee [,] and shall promptly pay to the
22 Division for deposit in the Fund the lesser of the amount of the award made from
23 the Fund or the amount recovered, less attorney’s fees and costs. The duty of

30 Statutes of Nevada 2011 and section 2 of chapter 391, Statutes of Nevada 2013 and
31 unless otherwise declared by law to be confidential, all public books and public
32 records of a governmental entity must be open at all times during office hours to
33 inspection by any person, and may be fully copied or an abstract or memorandum
34 may be prepared from those public books and public records. Any such copies,
35 abstracts or memoranda may be used to supply the general public with copies,
36 abstracts or memoranda of the records or may be used in any other way to the
37 advantage of the governmental entity or of the general public. This section does not
38 supersede or in any manner affect the federal laws governing copyrights or enlarge,
39 diminish or affect in any other manner the rights of a person in any written book or
40 record which is copyrighted pursuant to federal law.
41 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record which is
42 copyrighted solely because it is copyrighted.
43 3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a public book or
44 record shall not deny a request made pursuant to subsection 1 to inspect or copy or
45 receive a copy of a public book or record on the basis that the requested public
46 book or record contains information that is confidential if the governmental entity
47 can redact, delete, conceal or separate, including, without limitation, electronically,
48 the confidential information from the information included in the public book or
49 record that is not otherwise confidential.
50 4. If requested, a governmental entity shall provide a copy of a public record
51 in an electronic format by means of an electronic medium. Nothing in this
52 subsection requires a governmental entity to provide a copy of a public record in an
53 electronic format or by means of an electronic medium if:

Senate Amendment No. 801 to Senate Bill No. 76 First Reprint Page 15
1 (a) The public record:
2 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
3 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
4 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by means of an
5 electronic medium would:
6 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
7 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential and that
8 cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from information that is not
9 otherwise confidential.
10 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who has legal
11 custody or control of a public record:
12 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the medium that
13 is requested because the officer, employee or agent has already prepared or would
14 prefer to provide the copy in a different medium.
15 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon request, prepare
16 the copy of the public record and shall not require the person who has requested the
17 copy to prepare the copy himself or herself.
18 Sec. 12. The provisions of subsection 1 of NRS 218D.380 do not apply to
19 any provision of this act which adds or revises a requirement to submit a report to
20 the Legislature.
21 Sec. 13. 1. This section becomes effective upon passage and approval.
22 2. Sections 1 to 12, inclusive, of this act become effective:
23 (a) Upon passage and approval for the purpose of adopting any regulations and

25 out the provisions of this act; and
