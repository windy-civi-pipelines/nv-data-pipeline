for compensation from the Fund; requiring the
Administrator of the Securities Division of the Office of

exempt securities and exempt transactions; revising

received by the Administrator; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes the Uniform Securities Act, which sets forth provisions
2 governing the sale and purchase of securities in this State in a manner consistent
3 with federal laws and regulations. In general, the Act prohibits a person from
4 engaging in certain deceptive acts, practices or courses of business in connection
5 with the offer, sale or purchase of a security. (NRS 90.570-90.610) The Act also
-
*SB76_R1*

– 2 –
6 authorizes certain sanctions against a person who violates these prohibitions,
7 including civil penalties, criminal fines and payment of restitution. (NRS 90.630-
8 90.650) The Nevada Constitution entitles a victim of a crime to full and timely
9 restitution and requires all monetary payments, money and property collected from
10 any person ordered to make restitution to be first applied to pay the amounts
11 ordered as restitution to the victim. (Nev. Const. Art. 1, § 8A)
12 Section 6 of this bill creates the Fund for the Compensation of Victims of
13 Securities Fraud and requires that the money in the Fund be used for the
14 compensation of certain victims to whom restitution is owed. Section 2 of this bill
15 defines the term “Fund” to mean the Fund for the Compensation of Victims of
16 Securities Fraud. Section 3 of this bill: (1) establishes the process by which certain
17 persons to whom a court orders restitution may apply for and receive compensation
18 from the Fund; (2) authorizes an applicant to appeal a determination made
19 concerning an award of compensation from the Fund; and (3) makes confidential
20 certain information and documentation submitted in connection with such an
21 application. Section 11 of this bill makes a conforming change relating to the
22 information made confidential pursuant to section 3.
23 Section 4 of this bill requires the Securities Division of the Office of the
24 Secretary of State to adopt certain regulations relating to the Fund, including
25 regulations: (1) establishing eligibility requirements for an award of compensation
26 from the Fund; (2) prescribing certain other requirements relating to the award of
27 compensation from the Fund; and (3) establishing a procedure to appeal a
28 determination made concerning an award of compensation from the Fund. Section
29 5 of this bill requires the Administrator of the Division to prepare and submit a
30 biennial report to the Legislature that includes certain information relating to the
31 Fund. Section 6 requires the Division to prepare certain quarterly estimates
32 concerning the Fund and requires any money remaining in the Fund at the end of
33 each fiscal year to be carried forward to the next fiscal year. Section 7 of this bill:
34 (1) requires an applicant, as a condition of accepting an award of compensation
35 from the Fund, to take certain action if the applicant recovers unpaid restitution
36 after receiving such compensation; and (2) prescribes certain other conditions of
37 accepting an award of compensation from the Fund.
38 Existing law requires all money received by the Division or the Administrator
39 pursuant to the Act to be deposited in the State General Fund. (NRS 90.630,
40 90.650, 90.710) Section 10 of this bill requires not more than $500,000 of the
41 money received by the Administrator each fiscal year as a result of an enforcement
42 action relating to securities to be deposited with the State Treasurer for credit to the
43 Fund.
44 Existing law: (1) prohibits a person from offering to sell or selling any security
45 in this State unless the security meets certain registration requirements; (2) exempts
46 certain securities and certain transactions from the registration requirements under
47 certain circumstances; and (3) authorizes the Administrator to disallow certain
48 exemptions under certain circumstances. (NRS 90.460, 90.520, 90.530) Sections 8
49 and 9 of this bill remove a requirement that the Administrator disallow certain
50 exemptions by order, thereby authorizing the Administrator to disallow any such
51 exemption without issuing an order.

10 diminish or affect in any other manner the rights of a person in any
11 written book or record which is copyrighted pursuant to federal law.
12 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record

15 public book or record shall not deny a request made pursuant to

17 record on the basis that the requested public book or record contains
18 information that is confidential if the governmental entity can

29 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
30 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or

36 information that is not otherwise confidential.
37 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who
