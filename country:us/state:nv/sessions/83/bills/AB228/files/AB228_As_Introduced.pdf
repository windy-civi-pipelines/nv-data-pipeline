Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires, under certain circumstances, that a person provide
2 certain information to vote in person which may include, depending on the
3 circumstances, proof of residency and identity, answering questions covering the
4 personal data of the voter or providing additional personal data. (NRS 293.2725,
5 293.277, 293.285, 293.303, 293.3075, 293.3081, 293.3082, 293.3085, 293.3585,
6 293.541, 293C.270, 293C.275, 293C.292, 293C.3035, 293C.3585) Sections 40, 42,
7 44, 45, 48, 53, 111, 113, 114, 117 and 120 of this bill require, with certain
8 exceptions, that a person provide one of the forms of proof of identity specified in
9 section 4 of this bill to vote in person. Section 46 of this bill requires the Secretary
10 of State and each county and city clerk to ensure that instructions concerning the
11 proof of identity required to vote are posted at each polling place. Sections 29, 31,
12 43, 52, 63-72, 107, 112 and 118 of this bill make various conforming changes to
-

– 2 –
13 existing provisions to reflect the requirement to provide proof of identity to vote in
14 person.
15 Sections 27 and 28 of this bill: (1) require the Department of Motor Vehicles
16 to issue an identification card, free of charge, to a registered voter who does not
17 possess one of the acceptable forms of proof of identity and who is experiencing
18 financial hardship; and (2) require the registered voter to submit certain information
19 with an application for the identification card. Section 131 of this bill makes
20 conforming changes to reflect that such an identification card must be issued free of
21 charge.
22 Sections 47 and 115 of this bill provide that a person applying to vote whose
23 identity has been challenged must furnish proof of identity in response to such a
24 challenge.
25 Section 49 of this bill authorizes, under certain circumstances, a person who
26 fails to provide proof of identity when voting in person to cast a provisional ballot.
27 Section 50 of this bill makes conforming changes to the information that must be
28 provided to a person who casts a provisional ballot. Section 51 of this bill provides
29 that the provisional ballot of such a voter must be counted if the person provides
30 proof of identity to the county or city clerk, not later than 5 p.m. on the Friday
31 following election day.
32 Section 74 of this bill clarifies that voting the absent ballot of another person is
33 a category D felony.
34 Existing law establishes procedures for the preparation and distribution of mail
35 ballots to each active registered voter for every election, as well as procedures for
36 voting, returning, verifying, and counting the mail ballots. (NRS 293.269911-
37 293.269937, 293C.263-293C.26337) Section 132 of this bill repeals these
38 provisions. Sections 5-26 and 80-103 of this bill set forth the process for
39 requesting, voting, returning, verifying and counting absent ballots. Sections 30,
40 32-34, 36, 39, 54-62, 73, 76-78, 105, 106, 108-110, 116, 119 and 121-130 of this
41 bill make conforming changes to incorporate absent ballots into the relevant
42 provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes relating to elections. The provisions of this
43 bill relating to absent ballots are modeled after similar provisions of law that
44 existed before the Legislature enacted provisions relating to mail ballots in the 81st
45 session of the Legislature.
46 Existing law provides that a mail ballot that is mailed to the county or city clerk
47 must be postmarked on or before the day of the election. (NRS 293.269921,
48 293C.26321) Sections 16 and 91 of this bill provide that an absent ballot that is
49 mailed to the county or city clerk must be postmarked at least 3 days before the day
50 of the election.
51 Existing law provides that a person authorized by a voter may return a mail
52 ballot on behalf of the voter. (NRS 293.269923, 293C.26323) Sections 20 and 97
53 of this bill instead provide that, with certain exceptions, only the voter or, with the
54 authorization of the voter, a member of the immediate family of the voter may
55 return an absent ballot on behalf of the voter. Sections 20 and 97 also prohibit a
56 person from returning more than two absent ballots on behalf of a member of his or
57 her immediate family.
