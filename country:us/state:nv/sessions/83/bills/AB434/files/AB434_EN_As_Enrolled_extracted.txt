Section 1:
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to employment practices; making it unlawful for
an employer, with certain exceptions, to take or threaten to
take certain adverse employment actions against an employee
who declines to attend certain meetings or participate in
certain communications where the primary purpose of the
meeting or communication is to communicate the opinion of
the employer regarding religious matters or political matters;
providing a remedy for a violation committed by an
employer; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law establishes various unlawful employment practices. (Chapter 613
of NRS) This bill makes it unlawful for an employer to take or threaten to take
certain adverse employment actions against an employee because the employee
declines to attend a meeting sponsored by the employer or declines to participate in,
receive or listen to any communication by the employer or an agent or
representative thereof where the primary purpose of the meeting or communication
is to communicate the opinion of the employer regarding religious or political
matters. This bill provides an exception from existing provisions concerning
religious matters for a religious corporation, association or society. (NRS 613.320)
This bill also provides an exception if the declination by the employee substantially
or materially interferes with the bona fide job performance of the employee or the
working relationship between the employee and the employer. Under this bill, an
employer who violates the provisions of this bill is liable for: (1) damages caused
by the adverse employment action; (2) any punitive damages that the facts may
warrant; (3) the gross loss of wages or compensation of the employee; and (4) costs
and reasonable attorney’s fees as may be allowed by the court. This bill also
provides that if the court determines that an action brought by an employee under
this bill was brought without substantial justification, the court may award costs
and reasonable attorney’s fees to the employer.
