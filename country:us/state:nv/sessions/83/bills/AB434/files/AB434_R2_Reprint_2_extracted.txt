AN ACT relating to employment practices; making it unlawful for
an employer, with certain exceptions, to take or threaten
to take certain adverse employment actions against an

participate in certain communications where the primary
purpose of the meeting or communication is to

3 certain adverse employment actions against an employee because the employee
4 declines to attend a meeting sponsored by the employer or declines to participate in,
5 receive or listen to any communication by the employer or an agent or
6 representative thereof where the primary purpose of the meeting or communication
7 is to communicate the opinion of the employer regarding religious or political
8 matters. This bill provides an exception from existing provisions concerning
9 religious matters for a religious corporation, association or society. (NRS 613.320)
10 This bill also provides an exception if the declination by the employee substantially
11 or materially interferes with the bona fide job performance of the employee or the
12 working relationship between the employee and the employer. Under this bill, an
13 employer who violates the provisions of this bill is liable for: (1) damages caused
14 by the adverse employment action; (2) any punitive damages that the facts may
15 warrant; (3) the gross loss of wages or compensation of the employee; and (4) costs
16 and reasonable attorney’s fees as may be allowed by the court. This bill also
