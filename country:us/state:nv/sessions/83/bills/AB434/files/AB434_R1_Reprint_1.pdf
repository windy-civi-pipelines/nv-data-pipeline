AN ACT relating to employment practices; making it unlawful for
an employer, with certain exceptions, to take or threaten

of the meeting or communication is to communicate the
opinion of the employer regarding religious matters or
political matters; providing a remedy for a violation
committed by an employer; and providing other matters

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes various unlawful employment practices. (Chapter 613

3 certain adverse employment actions against an employee because the employee
4 declines to attend a meeting sponsored by the employer or declines to participate in,
5 receive or listen to any communication by the employer or an agent or
6 representative thereof where the purpose of the meeting or communication is to
7 communicate the opinion of the employer regarding religious or political matters.
8 This bill provides an exception from existing provisions concerning religious
9 matters for a religious corporation, association or society. (NRS 613.320) This bill
10 also provides an exception if the declination by the employee substantially or
11 materially interferes with the bona fide job performance of the employee or the
12 working relationship between the employee and the employer. Under this bill, an
13 employer who violates the provisions of this bill is liable for: (1) damages caused
14 by the adverse employment action; (2) any punitive damages that the facts may
15 warrant; (3) the gross loss of wages or compensation of the employee; and (4) costs
