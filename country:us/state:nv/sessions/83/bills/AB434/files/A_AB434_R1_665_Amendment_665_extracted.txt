AN ACT relating to employment practices; making it unlawful for an employer,
with certain exceptions, to take or threaten to take certain adverse
employment actions against an employee who declines to attend
certain meetings or participate in certain communications where the
primary purpose of the meeting or communication is to communicate
the opinion of the employer regarding religious matters or political
matters; providing a remedy for a violation committed by an employer;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes various unlawful employment practices. (Chapter 613 of NRS)
2 This bill makes it unlawful for an employer to take or threaten to take certain adverse
3 employment actions against an employee because the employee declines to attend a meeting
4 sponsored by the employer or declines to participate in, receive or listen to any
5 communication by the employer or an agent or representative thereof where the primary
6 purpose of the meeting or communication is to communicate the opinion of the employer
7 regarding religious or political matters. This bill provides an exception from existing
8 provisions concerning religious matters for a religious corporation, association or society.
9 (NRS 613.320) This bill also provides an exception if the declination by the employee
10 substantially or materially interferes with the bona fide job performance of the employee or
11 the working relationship between the employee and the employer. Under this bill, an
12 employer who violates the provisions of this bill is liable for: (1) damages caused by the
13 adverse employment action; (2) any punitive damages that the facts may warrant; (3) the gross
14 loss of wages or compensation of the employee; and (4) costs and reasonable attorney’s fees
15 as may be allowed by the court. This bill also provides that if the court determines that an
16 action brought by an employee under this bill was brought without substantial justification,
17 the court may award costs and reasonable attorney’s fees to the employer.
