EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to motor vehicle fuel; establishing certain requirements for the
display and labeling of pumps and dispensers for motor vehicle fuel at
a motor vehicle fuel dispensing site; requiring certain types of motor
vehicle fuel to be identified and labeled in a certain manner; revising
requirements relating to the advertisement of prices of motor vehicle
fuel; revising certain requirements relating to the letters, words, figures
and numerals used on an advertising medium for motor vehicle fuel;
repealing requirements for certain letters and numerals used on
advertising mediums; providing penalties; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth certain requirements for the advertisement of motor vehicle fuel
2 and petroleum products. (NRS 590.160-590.330) Section 2 of this bill requires the owner or
3 operator of a motor vehicle fuel dispensing site to ensure that each pump or dispenser
4 displays or is labeled with certain information. Section 2 also requires the owner or operator
5 to post a sign or label containing certain information at a motor vehicle fuel dispensing site
6 that is unattended.
7 Section 3 of this bill requires, with certain exceptions, an advertising medium, pump or
8 dispenser for ethanol flex fuel, biodiesel or a biodiesel blend to: (1) identify the fuels in a
9 certain manner; and (2) be labeled with the automotive fuel rating in accordance with the
10 requirements of federal law. Section 3 also authorizes the State Board of Agriculture to
11 adopt regulations to establish alternative identifications for ethanol flex fuel, biodiesel or
12 a biodiesel blend to be used on an advertising medium, pump or dispenser.
13 Section 4 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law governing motor vehicle fuel
14 to the provisions of sections 2 and 3.
15 Existing law requires advertising mediums for motor vehicle fuel to display the actual
16 price per unit of measure of motor vehicle fuel, including taxes, together with the brand name
17 and the individual grade or grades of the motor vehicle fuel being advertised. (NRS 590.170)
18 Section 5 of this bill requires an advertising medium that advertises motor vehicle fuel prices
19 using gallons to display the same total price per gallon on the advertising medium and the

Senate Amendment No. 631 to Assembly Bill No. 29 Page 4
20 pump or dispenser. Section 5 requires that, if the price of the fuel: (1) increases from the
21 advertised price, the price on the advertising medium must be changed before or at the same
22 time the price is changed on the pump or dispenser; and (2) decreases from the advertised
23 price, the price on the pump or dispenser must be changed before or at the same time the price
24 is changed on the advertising medium.
25 Section 5 also requires any roadside sign that advertises or displays the price of motor
26 vehicle fuel but is not connected to a pump or dispenser for motor vehicle fuel to state certain
27 information relating to the price and unit of measure of the fuel.
28 Existing law authorizes the advertisement of the price of diesel fuel excluding state tax if
29 the sign contains certain wording in a size not less than 4 inches in height. (NRS 590.170)
30 Section 5 instead requires that the wording be not less than one-third of the height of the
31 numerals used to indicate the price of the diesel fuel.
32 Existing law requires that all letters, words, figures or numerals used on an advertising
33 medium to indicate the price of motor vehicle fuel be uniform in size, at least 6 inches in
34 height and the height must not be more than twice the width. (NRS 590.180, 590.200)
35 Section 6 of this bill removes a reference to this requirement, but does not eliminate the
36 requirement. Section 7 of this bill clarifies that if a fraction is used on a price sign to indicate
37 the price of motor vehicle fuel, the combined height of the numerator and denominator must
38 be of the same height and design as the other numerals indicating price.
39 Existing law requires that if the price of a brand name or grade of motor vehicle fuel is
40 advertised by means of a price sign and is sold at different prices, the sign or signs advertising
41 the prices must include notice of the conditions under which the brand name or grade is sold.
42 (NRS 590.230) Section 8 of this bill requires that if a brand or grade of motor vehicle fuel is
43 sold at different prices based on whether a customer meets a condition, the price must be
44 available to all customers who meet the condition. Section 8 also provides that if a sign or
45 signs [advertises] advertise different prices based on: (1) whether the fuel is purchased with
46 cash or credit, the sign or signs must state both the cash and credit price or the highest of
47 either the cash or credit price; (2) whether the grade of fuel is alcohol-free, the sign or signs
48 may state the lowest of the two prices; and (3) a customer loyalty program or similar program,
49 the sign or signs must state both the highest price that may be charged if a customer does not
50 qualify and the discounted price or may state only the highest price.
51 Existing law requires that all letters, words, figures or numerals used on an advertising
52 medium be plainly visible and of such colors or tints to contrast with the remaining parts of
53 the advertising medium. (NRS 590.260) Section 9 of this bill additionally requires that the
54 letters, words, figures or numerals appearing on an electronic sign meet such requirements and
55 be clearly visible during the day and at night.
56 Section 10 of this bill reorganizes requirements that certain words, letters, figures or
57 numerals on an advertising medium be of like color or tint.
58 Sections 11 and 12 of this bill make the civil and criminal penalties of the existing law
59 governing the advertisement of motor vehicle fuel and petroleum products apply to a person
60 who violates the provisions of sections 2 and 3.
61 Section 13 of this bill repeals an exemption for the numeral “1” and the letter “l” from
62 certain advertising requirements for motor vehicle fuel and petroleum products.
