Assembly Bill No. 29–Committee on Natural Resources
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to motor vehicle fuel; establishing certain
requirements for the display and labeling of pumps and
dispensers for motor vehicle fuel at a motor vehicle fuel
dispensing site; requiring certain types of motor vehicle fuel
to be identified and labeled in a certain manner; revising
requirements relating to the advertisement of prices of motor
vehicle fuel; revising certain requirements relating to the
letters, words, figures and numerals used on an advertising
medium for motor vehicle fuel; repealing requirements for
certain letters and numerals used on advertising mediums;
providing penalties; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law sets forth certain requirements for the advertisement of motor
vehicle fuel and petroleum products. (NRS 590.160-590.330) Section 2 of this bill
requires the owner or operator of a motor vehicle fuel dispensing site to ensure that
each pump or dispenser displays or is labeled with certain information. Section 2
also requires the owner or operator to post a sign or label containing certain
information at a motor vehicle fuel dispensing site that is unattended.
Section 3 of this bill requires, with certain exceptions, an advertising medium,
pump or dispenser for ethanol flex fuel, biodiesel or a biodiesel blend to: (1)
identify the fuels in a certain manner; and (2) be labeled with the automotive fuel
rating in accordance with the requirements of federal law. Section 3 also authorizes
the State Board of Agriculture to adopt regulations to establish alternative
identifications for ethanol flex fuel, biodiesel or a biodiesel blend to be used on an
advertising medium, pump or dispenser.
Section 4 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law governing motor
vehicle fuel to the provisions of sections 2 and 3.
Existing law requires advertising mediums for motor vehicle fuel to display the
actual price per unit of measure of motor vehicle fuel, including taxes, together
with the brand name and the individual grade or grades of the motor vehicle fuel
being advertised. (NRS 590.170) Section 5 of this bill requires an advertising
medium that advertises motor vehicle fuel prices using gallons to display the same
total price per gallon on the advertising medium and the pump or dispenser.
Section 5 requires that, if the price of the fuel: (1) increases from the advertised
price, the price on the advertising medium must be changed before or at the same
time the price is changed on the pump or dispenser; and (2) decreases from the
advertised price, the price on the pump or dispenser must be changed before or at
the same time the price is changed on the advertising medium.
Section 5 also requires any roadside sign that advertises or displays the price of
motor vehicle fuel but is not connected to a pump or dispenser for motor vehicle
fuel to state certain information relating to the price and unit of measure of the fuel.
Existing law authorizes the advertisement of the price of diesel fuel excluding
state tax if the sign contains certain wording in a size not less than 4 inches in
height. (NRS 590.170) Section 5 instead requires that the wording be not less than
one-third of the height of the numerals used to indicate the price of the diesel fuel.

Existing law requires that all letters, words, figures or numerals used on an
advertising medium to indicate the price of motor vehicle fuel be uniform in size, at
least 6 inches in height and the height must not be more than twice the width. (NRS
590.180, 590.200) Section 6 of this bill removes a reference to this requirement,
but does not eliminate the requirement. Section 7 of this bill clarifies that if a
fraction is used on a price sign to indicate the price of motor vehicle fuel, the
combined height of the numerator and denominator must be of the same height and
design as the other numerals indicating price.
Existing law requires that if the price of a brand name or grade of motor vehicle
fuel is advertised by means of a price sign and is sold at different prices, the sign or
signs advertising the prices must include notice of the conditions under which the
brand name or grade is sold. (NRS 590.230) Section 8 of this bill requires that if a
brand or grade of motor vehicle fuel is sold at different prices based on whether a
customer meets a condition, the price must be available to all customers who meet
the condition. Section 8 also provides that if a sign or signs advertise different
prices based on: (1) whether the fuel is purchased with cash or credit, the sign or
signs must state both the cash and credit price or the highest of either the cash or
credit price; (2) whether the grade of fuel is alcohol-free, the sign or signs may state
the lowest of the two prices; and (3) a customer loyalty program or similar
program, the sign or signs must state both the highest price that may be charged if a
customer does not qualify and the discounted price or may state only the highest
price.
Existing law requires that all letters, words, figures or numerals used on an
advertising medium be plainly visible and of such colors or tints to contrast with
the remaining parts of the advertising medium. (NRS 590.260) Section 9 of this bill
additionally requires that the letters, words, figures or numerals appearing on an
electronic sign meet such requirements and be clearly visible during the day and at
night.
Section 10 of this bill reorganizes requirements that certain words, letters,
figures or numerals on an advertising medium be of like color or tint.
Sections 11 and 12 of this bill make the civil and criminal penalties of the
existing law governing the advertisement of motor vehicle fuel and petroleum
products apply to a person who violates the provisions of sections 2 and 3.
Section 13 of this bill repeals an exemption for the numeral “1” and the letter
“l” from certain advertising requirements for motor vehicle fuel and petroleum
products.
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
