AN ACT relating to motor vehicle fuel; establishing certain
requirements for the labeling of pumps and dispensers for
motor vehicle fuel at a motor vehicle fuel dispensing site;
requiring certain types of motor vehicle fuel to be
identified and labeled in a certain manner; revising
requirements relating to the advertisement of prices of
motor vehicle fuel; revising certain requirements relating
to the letters, words, figures and numerals used on an
advertising medium for motor vehicle fuel; repealing
requirements for certain letters and numerals used on

other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth certain requirements for the advertisement of motor
2 vehicle fuel and petroleum products. (NRS 590.160-590.330) Section 2 of this bill
3 requires the owner or operator of a motor vehicle fuel dispensing site to ensure that
4 each pump or dispenser is labeled with certain information. Section 2 also requires
5 the owner or operator to post a sign or label containing certain information at a
6 motor vehicle dispensing site that is unattended.
7 Section 3 of this bill requires, with certain exceptions, an advertising medium,
8 pump or dispenser for ethanol flex fuel, biodiesel or a biodiesel blend to: (1)
9 identify the fuels in a certain manner; and (2) be labeled with the automotive fuel
10 rating in accordance with the requirements of federal law.

11 Section 4 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law governing motor
12 vehicle fuel to the provisions of sections 2 and 3.
13 Existing law requires advertising mediums for motor vehicle fuel to display the
14 actual price per unit of measure of motor vehicle fuel, including taxes, together
15 with the brand name and the individual grade or grades of motor vehicle fuel being
16 advertised. (NRS 590.170) Section 5 of this bill requires an advertising medium
17 that advertises motor vehicle fuel prices using gallons to display the same total
18 price per gallon on the advertising medium and the pump or dispenser. Section 5
19 requires that, if the price of the fuel: (1) increases from the advertised price, the
20 price on the advertising medium must be changed before or at the same time the
21 price is changed on the pump or dispenser; and (2) decreases from the advertised
22 price, the price on the pump or dispenser must be changed before or at the same
23 time the price is changed on the advertising medium.
24 Section 5 also requires any roadside sign that advertises or displays the price of
25 motor vehicle fuel but is not connected to a pump or dispenser for motor vehicle
26 fuel to state certain information relating to the price and unit of measure of the fuel.
27 Existing law authorizes the advertisement of the price of diesel fuel excluding
28 state tax if the sign contains certain wording in a size not less than 4 inches in
29 height. (NRS 590.170) Section 5 instead requires that the wording be not less than
30 one-third of the height of the numerals used to indicate the price of the diesel fuel.
31 Existing law requires that all letters, words, figures or numerals used on an
32 advertising medium to indicate the price of motor vehicle fuel be uniform in size, at
33 least 6 inches in height and the height not more than twice the width. (NRS
34 590.180, 590.200) Section 6 of this bill removes a reference to this requirement,
35 but does not eliminate the requirement. Section 7 of this bill clarifies that if a
36 fraction is used on a price sign to indicate the price of motor vehicle fuel, the
37 combined height of the numerator and denominator must be of the same height and
38 design as the other numerals indicating price.
39 Existing law requires that if the price of a brand name or grade of motor vehicle
40 fuel is advertised by means of a price sign and is sold at different prices, the sign or
41 signs advertising the prices must include notice of the conditions under which the
42 brand name or grade is sold. (NRS 590.230) Section 8 of this bill requires that if a
43 brand or grade of motor vehicle fuel is sold at different prices based on whether a
44 customer meets a condition, the price must be available to all customers who meet
45 the condition. Section 8 also provides that if a sign or signs advertises different
46 prices based on: (1) whether the fuel is purchased with cash or credit, the sign or
47 signs must state both the cash and credit price or the highest of either the cash or
48 credit price; (2) whether the grade of fuel is alcohol-free, the sign or signs may state
49 the lowest of the two prices; and (3) a customer loyalty program or similar
50 program, the sign or signs must state both the highest price that may be charged if a
51 customer does not qualify and the discounted price or may state only the highest
52 price.
53 Existing law requires that all letters, words, figures or numerals used on an
54 advertising medium be plainly visible and of such colors or tints to contrast with
55 the remaining parts of the advertising medium. (NRS 590.260) Section 9 of this bill
56 additionally requires that the letters, words, figures or numerals appearing on an
57 electronic sign meet such requirements and be clearly visible during the day and at
58 night.
59 Section 10 of this bill reorganizes requirements that certain words, letters,
60 figures or numerals on advertising medium be of like color or tint.
61 Sections 11 and 12 of this bill make the civil and criminal penalties of the
62 existing law governing the advertisement of motor vehicle fuel and petroleum
63 products apply to a person who violates the provisions of sections 2 and 3.

65 “l” from certain advertising requirements for motor vehicle fuel and petroleum
66 products.

A.B. 29
ASSEMBLY BILL NO. 29–COMMITTEE ON NATURAL RESOURCES
(ON BEHALF OF THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE)
PREFILED NOVEMBER 14, 2024
____________
Referred to Committee on Natural Resources
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to motor vehicle fuel.
(BDR 51-271)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: Increases or Newly
Provides for Term of Imprisonment in County or City
Jail or Detention Facility.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to motor vehicle fuel; establishing certain
requirements for the labeling of pumps and dispensers for
motor vehicle fuel at a motor vehicle fuel dispensing site;
requiring certain types of motor vehicle fuel to be
identified and labeled in a certain manner; revising
requirements relating to the advertisement of prices of
motor vehicle fuel; revising certain requirements relating
to the letters, words, figures and numerals used on an
advertising medium for motor vehicle fuel; repealing
requirements for certain letters and numerals used on
advertising mediums; providing penalties; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth certain requirements for the advertisement of motor
2 vehicle fuel and petroleum products. (NRS 590.160-590.330) Section 2 of this bill
3 requires the owner or operator of a motor vehicle fuel dispensing site to ensure that
4 each pump or dispenser is labeled with certain information. Section 2 also requires
5 the owner or operator to post a sign or label containing certain information at a
6 motor vehicle dispensing site that is unattended.
7 Section 3 of this bill requires, with certain exceptions, an advertising medium,
8 pump or dispenser for ethanol flex fuel, biodiesel or a biodiesel blend to: (1)
9 identify the fuels in a certain manner; and (2) be labeled with the automotive fuel
10 rating in accordance with the requirements of federal law.
-
*AB29*

– 2 –
11 Section 4 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law governing motor
12 vehicle fuel to the provisions of sections 2 and 3.
13 Existing law requires advertising mediums for motor vehicle fuel to display the
14 actual price per unit of measure of motor vehicle fuel, including taxes, together
15 with the brand name and the individual grade or grades of motor vehicle fuel being
16 advertised. (NRS 590.170) Section 5 of this bill requires an advertising medium
17 that advertises motor vehicle fuel prices using gallons to display the same total
18 price per gallon on the advertising medium and the pump or dispenser. Section 5
19 requires that, if the price of the fuel: (1) increases from the advertised price, the
20 price on the advertising medium must be changed before or at the same time the
21 price is changed on the pump or dispenser; and (2) decreases from the advertised
22 price, the price on the pump or dispenser must be changed before or at the same
23 time the price is changed on the advertising medium.
24 Section 5 also requires any roadside sign that advertises or displays the price of
25 motor vehicle fuel but is not connected to a pump or dispenser for motor vehicle
26 fuel to state certain information relating to the price and unit of measure of the fuel.
27 Existing law authorizes the advertisement of the price of diesel fuel excluding
28 state tax if the sign contains certain wording in a size not less than 4 inches in
29 height. (NRS 590.170) Section 5 instead requires that the wording be not less than
30 one-third of the height of the numerals used to indicate the price of the diesel fuel.
31 Existing law requires that all letters, words, figures or numerals used on an
32 advertising medium to indicate the price of motor vehicle fuel be uniform in size, at
33 least 6 inches in height and the height not more than twice the width. (NRS
34 590.180, 590.200) Section 6 of this bill removes a reference to this requirement,
35 but does not eliminate the requirement. Section 7 of this bill clarifies that if a
36 fraction is used on a price sign to indicate the price of motor vehicle fuel, the
37 combined height of the numerator and denominator must be of the same height and
38 design as the other numerals indicating price.
39 Existing law requires that if the price of a brand name or grade of motor vehicle
40 fuel is advertised by means of a price sign and is sold at different prices, the sign or
41 signs advertising the prices must include notice of the conditions under which the
42 brand name or grade is sold. (NRS 590.230) Section 8 of this bill requires that if a
43 brand or grade of motor vehicle fuel is sold at different prices based on whether a
44 customer meets a condition, the price must be available to all customers who meet
45 the condition. Section 8 also provides that if a sign or signs advertises different
46 prices based on: (1) whether the fuel is purchased with cash or credit, the sign or
47 signs must state both the cash and credit price or the highest of either the cash or
48 credit price; (2) whether the grade of fuel is alcohol-free, the sign or signs may state
49 the lowest of the two prices; and (3) a customer loyalty program or similar
50 program, the sign or signs must state both the highest price that may be charged if a
51 customer does not qualify and the discounted price or may state only the highest
52 price.
53 Existing law requires that all letters, words, figures or numerals used on an
54 advertising medium be plainly visible and of such colors or tints to contrast with
55 the remaining parts of the advertising medium. (NRS 590.260) Section 9 of this bill
56 additionally requires that the letters, words, figures or numerals appearing on an
57 electronic sign meet such requirements and be clearly visible during the day and at
58 night.
59 Section 10 of this bill reorganizes requirements that certain words, letters,
60 figures or numerals on advertising medium be of like color or tint.
61 Sections 11 and 12 of this bill make the civil and criminal penalties of the
62 existing law governing the advertisement of motor vehicle fuel and petroleum
63 products apply to a person who violates the provisions of sections 2 and 3.

64 Section 13 of this bill repeals an exemption for the numeral “1” and the letter
65 “l” from certain advertising requirements for motor vehicle fuel and petroleum
66 products.
