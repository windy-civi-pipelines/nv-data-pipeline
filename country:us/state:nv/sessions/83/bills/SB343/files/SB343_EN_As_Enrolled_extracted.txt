Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law establishes the Agricultural Extension Department in the Public
Service Division of the Nevada System of Higher Education. (NRS 396.600)
Sections 1-5, 11-14, 20, 21, 44 and 45 of this bill change the name of the
Agricultural Extension Department to the University of Nevada Cooperative
Extension.
Existing law continues the State 4-H Camp Institute and Exhibit located in
Douglas County, Nevada, and establishes branches in the respective counties of this
State, as part of the cooperative extension work of this State. (NRS 550.020)
Section 6 of this bill provides that the purpose of the State 4-H Camp is to provide
a living and learning environment in a natural setting where members of the 4-H
clubs and other youth groups may learn life skills, leadership, citizenship and an
appreciation for nature.
Existing law creates the State 4-H Camp Advisory Council, which consists of
12 members who serve terms of 3 years. The members include: (1) four members
from the leaders of 4-H clubs in this State, elected by the leaders; (2) two
members appointed by the President of the University of Nevada, Reno; (3) four
members designated from among its members by the Nevada Farm Bureau; and (4)
two members from the Agricultural Extension Service, elected by county agents.
(NRS 550.035) Section 7 of this bill instead provides that four members are
designated by the Nevada Farm Bureau and two members are designated by the
-

– 2 –
Director of the University of Nevada Cooperative Extension. Section 7 further: (1)
requires, to the extent practicable, that the terms of the members be staggered; (2)
prohibits, with certain exceptions, a member from serving more than two
consecutive terms unless there is a break in service of not less than 1 year; and (3)
authorizes a member to serve three consecutive terms with the approval of the
Director.
Existing law requires the Director of the Agricultural Extension Department to
cooperate with the State 4-H Camp Advisory Council, the State 4-H Leaders’
Council, youth organizations, farm organizations, counties and cities in this State,
and other private or government organizations or individuals for the purpose of
carrying out the provisions of law governing the State 4-H Camp. (NRS 550.050)
Section 8 of this bill eliminates this requirement.
Existing law grants the title to the site of the State 4-H Camp in Douglas
County, Nevada, to the Board of Regents of the University of Nevada. (NRS
550.100) Further, existing law authorizes the Board of Regents, upon the
recommendation of the Director of the Agricultural Extension Department and the
State 4-H Camp Advisory Council, with the approval of the Governor, to lease,
exchange or sell any parcel or parcels of real property composing the State 4-H
Camp when such land can no longer serve certain purposes. (NRS 550.070)
Section 9 of this bill instead provides that any parcel or parcels of the State 4-H
Camp may not be leased, exchanged or sold without express authority from the
Legislature. Section 9 further authorizes the Board of Regents, upon the
recommendation of the Director of the University of Nevada Cooperative
Extension and the State 4-H Camp Advisory Council, with the approval of the
Governor, to submit a recommendation to the Legislative Commission that such
property composing the State 4-H Camp be leased, exchanged or sold.
Existing law authorizes the Director of the Agricultural Extension Department,
with the approval of the Board of Regents and the 4-H Camp Advisory Council, to
conduct negotiations with public or private agencies for certain rights, adjustments
or services relating to real property. Under existing law, such negotiations are not
binding on the Board of Regents unless or until the negotiations are ratified and
authorized by the Board of Regents. (NRS 550.080) Section 10 of this bill
additionally provides that such negotiations are not binding on the State unless or
until the negotiations are ratified and authorized by the Legislature.
Sections 8-10 authorize a designee of the Director of the University of Nevada

Existing law creates the Technological Crime Advisory Board to, among
certain other duties, facilitate cooperation between state, local and federal officers
in detecting, investigating and prosecuting technological crimes. (NRS 205A.010-
205A.100) Section 51 of this bill abolishes the Advisory Board. Section 15 of this
bill makes a technical change to reorganize the definition of “technological crime”
into certain existing provisions governing the forfeiture of property relating to
technological crimes. (NRS 179.1217) Sections 17, 48 and 49 of this bill revise
references to the definition of “technological crime.” Section 19 of this bill
eliminates a reference to the Advisory Board.
Existing law also creates the Account for the Technological Crime Advisory
Board and requires, with certain exceptions, money from the disposition of certain
property acquired through the commission of a technological crime to be deposited
into the Account. Such proceeds are required to be: (1) used to carry out the duties
of the Advisory Board; and (2) distributed to the federal, state and local law
enforcement agencies that participated in the investigation of the unlawful act
giving rise to the criminal or civil forfeiture. (NRS 179.1233, 205A.090) Section
51 abolishes the Account. Section 16 of this bill: (1) requires that the proceeds of
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 3 –
such forfeitures be deposited in the State Treasury and accounted for separately in
State General Fund; and (2) transfers to the Attorney General the duty of the
distribution of the proceeds to certain federal, state and local law enforcement
agencies.
Existing law creates the Council to Establish Academic Standards for Public
Schools to establish standards of content and performance for certain courses of
study. Additionally, existing law requires the board of trustees of each school
district to conduct a periodic review of the courses of study offered in the public
schools of the school district to determine compliance with the standards of content
and performance established by the Council. (NRS 389.500-389.540) Section 51
abolishes the Council and the requirement for the board of trustees to review the
courses of study for compliance with the standards established by the Council.
Sections 18, 22, 23, 26-35 and 37-41 of this bill eliminate references to the
standards established by the Council. Sections 36 and 43 of this bill eliminate
references to the Council.
Existing law requires, with certain exceptions, an applicant for certain positions
or contracts with a postsecondary educational institution to submit certain
information to the Administrator of the Commission on Postsecondary Education
for the purposes of conducting a background investigation. (NRS 394.465) Section
42 of this bill exempts an applicant from this requirement if the applicant holds a
professional or occupational license in this State for which a background
investigation was required.
Existing law creates the Advisory Committee on Medicaid Innovation in the
Division of Health Care Financing and Policy of the Department of Health and
Human Services. The Advisory Committee is required to provide certain
recommendations to the Director of the Department, including, without limitation,
to create or expand public or private prescription purchasing coalitions, encourage
access to employer-based health insurance plans and waivers the State may apply
for from the Federal Government relating to Medicaid. (NRS 422.162, 422.165)
Section 51 abolishes the Advisory Committee. Section 46 of this bill transfers the
duties of the Advisory Committee to the Division of Health Care Financing and
Policy.
Existing law requires the Division of Environmental Protection of the State
Department of Conservation and Natural Resources to establish a working group to
study issues relating to environmental contamination resulting from perfluoroalkyl
and polyfluoroalkyl substances in this State. (NRS 459.686) Section 51 abolishes
the working group. Section 47 of this bill eliminates a reference to the repealed
section that establishes the working group.
Existing law creates the Rangeland Resources Commission. Under existing
law, the Commission: (1) may establish programs to provide information to the
residents of this State concerning livestock industry on grazing lands; (2) may
support the responsible control, management or use of grazing lands; and (3) is
required to charge and collect a fee from each person who grazed cattle or sheep on
grazing lands under the authorization of the United States Forest Service or the
Bureau of Land Management. The Commission consists of one member from each
state grazing board and the president of: (1) the Nevada Cattlemen’s Association or
its successor organization; (2) the Nevada Woolgrowers’ Association or its
successor organization; and (3) the Nevada Farm Bureau or its successor
organization. Each member who is appointed by a state grazing board serves a term
of 4 years. (NRS 563.290, 563.320, 563.340) Section 50 of this bill requires, to the
extent practicable, that the terms of the appointed members of the Commission are
staggered.

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
Section 1. NRS 549.010 is hereby amended to read as follows:
549.010 To provide for continued educational, research,
outreach and service programs pertaining to agriculture, community
development, health and nutrition, horticulture, personal and family
development, and natural resources in the rural and urban
communities in the State of Nevada, the Director of the
[Agricultural] University of Nevada Cooperative Extension
[Department] of the Public Service Division of the Nevada System
of Higher Education and the boards of county commissioners of any
or all of the respective counties of the State of Nevada may enter
into cooperative agreements and activities subject to the provisions
of this chapter.
Sec. 2. NRS 549.020 is hereby amended to read as follows:
549.020 1. The Director of the [Agricultural] University of
Nevada Cooperative Extension [Department] of the Public Service
Division of the Nevada System of Higher Education shall prepare
and submit to the board of county commissioners, for each county
participating, an annual financial budget covering the county, state
and federal funds cooperating in the cost of educational, research,
outreach and service programs pertaining to agriculture, community
development, health and nutrition, horticulture, personal and family
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 5 –
development, and natural resources in the rural and urban
communities in the State of Nevada.
2. The budget must be adopted by the board of county
commissioners and certified as a part of the annual county budget,
and the county tax levy provided for agricultural extension work in
the annual county budget must include a levy of not less than 1 cent
on each $100 of taxable property. If the proceeds of the county tax
levy of 1 cent are insufficient to meet the county’s share of the
cooperative agricultural extension work, as provided in the
combined annual financial budget, the board of county
commissioners may, by unanimous vote, levy an additional tax so
that the total in no instance exceeds 5 cents on each $100 of the
county tax rate.
3. The proceeds of such a tax must be placed in the agricultural
extension fund in each county treasury and must be paid out on
claims drawn by the agricultural extension agent of the county as
designated by the Director of the [Agricultural] University of
Nevada Cooperative Extension [Department] of the Public Service
Division of the Nevada System of Higher Education, when
approved by the Director and countersigned by the Treasurer of the
Nevada System of Higher Education.
4. A record of all such claims approved and paid, segregated by
counties, must be kept by the Treasurer of the Nevada System of
Higher Education. The cost of maintaining the record must be paid
from state funds provided for by this chapter.
5. The State’s cooperative share of the cost of such agricultural
extension work, as entered in the budget described in this section,
must not be more than a sum equal to the proceeds of 1 cent of such
county tax rate; but when the proceeds of a 1-cent tax rate are
insufficient to carry out the provisions of the budget previously
adopted, the Director of the [Agricultural] University of Nevada
Cooperative Extension [Department] of the Public Service Division
of the Nevada System of Higher Education is authorized to
supplement the State’s cooperative share from the funds as may be
made available in the Public Service Division Fund of the Nevada
System of Higher Education.
Sec. 3. NRS 549.030 is hereby amended to read as follows:
549.030 1. A certified copy of the county extension work
budget as adopted and approved pursuant to NRS 549.020 must be
filed with the Treasurer of the Nevada System of Higher Education
within 10 days after its approval by the board of county
commissioners.
