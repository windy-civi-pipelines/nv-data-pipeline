3 Sections 1-5, 11-14, 20, 21, 44 and 45 of this bill change the name of the
4 Agricultural Extension Department to the University of Nevada Cooperative
5 Extension.
6 Existing law continues the State 4-H Camp Institute and Exhibit located in
7 Douglas County, Nevada, and establishes branches in the respective counties of this
8 State, as part of the cooperative extension work of this State. (NRS 550.020)
9 Section 6 of this bill provides that the purpose of the State 4-H Camp is to provide
10 a living and learning environment in a natural setting where members of the 4-H
11 clubs and other youth groups may learn life skills, leadership, citizenship and an
12 appreciation for nature.
13 Existing law creates the State 4-H Camp Advisory Council, which consists of
14 12 members who serve terms of 3 years. The members include: (1) four members
15 from the leaders of 4-H clubs in this State, elected by the leaders; (2) two
16 members appointed by the President of the University of Nevada, Reno; (3) four
17 members designated from among its members by the Nevada Farm Bureau; and (4)
18 two members from the Agricultural Extension Service, elected by county agents.
19 (NRS 550.035) Section 7 of this bill instead provides that four members are
20 designated by the Nevada Farm Bureau and two members are designated by the
21 Director of the University of Nevada Cooperative Extension. Section 7 further: (1)
22 requires, to the extent practicable, that the terms of the members be staggered; (2)
23 prohibits, with certain exceptions, a member from serving more than two
24 consecutive terms unless there is a break in service of not less than 1 year; and (3)
25 authorizes a member to serve three consecutive terms with the approval of the
26 Director.
27 Existing law requires the Director of the Agricultural Extension Department to
28 cooperate with the State 4-H Camp Advisory Council, the State 4-H Leaders’
29 Council, youth organizations, farm organizations, counties and cities in this State,
30 and other private or government organizations or individuals for the purpose of
31 carrying out the provisions of law governing the State 4-H Camp. (NRS 550.050)
32 Section 8 of this bill eliminates this requirement.
33 Existing law grants the title to the site of the State 4-H Camp in Douglas
34 County, Nevada, to the Board of Regents of the University of Nevada. (NRS
35 550.100) Further, existing law authorizes the Board of Regents, upon the
36 recommendation of the Director of the Agricultural Extension Department and the
37 State 4-H Camp Advisory Council, with the approval of the Governor, to lease,
38 exchange or sell any parcel or parcels of real property composing the State 4-H
39 Camp when such land can no longer serve certain purposes. (NRS 550.070)
40 Section 9 of this bill instead provides that any parcel or parcels of the State 4-H
41 Camp may not be leased, exchanged or sold without express authority from the
42 Legislature. Section 9 further authorizes the Board of Regents, upon the
43 recommendation of the Director of the University of Nevada Cooperative

53 additionally provides that such negotiations are not binding on the State unless or
54 until the negotiations are ratified and authorized by the Legislature.

56 Cooperative Extension to perform certain duties of the Director.
57 Existing law creates the Technological Crime Advisory Board to, among
58 certain other duties, facilitate cooperation between state, local and federal officers
59 in detecting, investigating and prosecuting technological crimes. (NRS 205A.010-

61 bill makes a technical change to reorganize the definition of “technological crime”
62 into certain existing provisions governing the forfeiture of property relating to
63 technological crimes. (NRS 179.1217) Sections 17, 48 and 49 of this bill revise
64 references to the definition of “technological crime.” Section 19 of this bill
65 eliminates a reference to the Advisory Board.
66 Existing law also creates the Account for the Technological Crime Advisory
67 Board and requires, with certain exceptions, money from the disposition of certain
68 property acquired through the commission of a technological crime to be deposited
69 into the Account. Such proceeds are required to be: (1) used to carry out the duties
70 of the Advisory Board; and (2) distributed to the federal, state and local law
71 enforcement agencies that participated in the investigation of the unlawful act
72 giving rise to the criminal or civil forfeiture. (NRS 179.1233, 205A.090) Section
73 51 abolishes the Account. Section 16 of this bill: (1) requires that the proceeds of
74 such forfeitures be deposited in the State Treasury and accounted for separately in
75 State General Fund; and (2) transfers to the Attorney General the duty of the
76 distribution of the proceeds to certain federal, state and local law enforcement
77 agencies.
78 Existing law creates the Council to Establish Academic Standards for Public

81 district to conduct a periodic review of the courses of study offered in the public
82 schools of the school district to determine compliance with the standards of content
83 and performance established by the Council. (NRS 389.500-389.540) Section 51
84 abolishes the Council and the requirement for the board of trustees to review the
85 courses of study for compliance with the standards established by the Council.
86 Sections 18, 22, 23, 26-35 and 37-41 of this bill eliminate references to the

89 Existing law requires, with certain exceptions, an applicant for certain positions
90 or contracts with a postsecondary educational institution to submit certain
91 information to the Administrator of the Commission on Postsecondary Education
92 for the purposes of conducting a background investigation. (NRS 394.465) Section
93 42 of this bill exempts an applicant from this requirement if the applicant holds a
94 professional or occupational license in this State for which a background
95 investigation was required.
96 Existing law creates the Advisory Committee on Medicaid Innovation in the
97 Division of Health Care Financing and Policy of the Department of Health and

101 access to employer-based health insurance plans and waivers the State may apply
102 for from the Federal Government relating to Medicaid. (NRS 422.162, 422.165)
103 Section 51 abolishes the Advisory Committee. Section 46 of this bill transfers the
104 duties of the Advisory Committee to the Division of Health Care Financing and
105 Policy.
106 Existing law requires the Division of Environmental Protection of the State
107 Department of Conservation and Natural Resources to establish a working group to

109 and polyfluoroalkyl substances in this State. (NRS 459.686) Section 51 abolishes

110 the working group. Section 47 of this bill eliminates a reference to the repealed

114 residents of this State concerning livestock industry on grazing lands; (2) may
115 support the responsible control, management or use of grazing lands; and (3) is
116 required to charge and collect a fee from each person who grazed cattle or sheep on
117 grazing lands under the authorization of the United States Forest Service or the

119 state grazing board and the president of: (1) the Nevada Cattlemen’s Association or
120 its successor organization; (2) the Nevada Woolgrowers’ Association or its
121 successor organization; and (3) the Nevada Farm Bureau or its successor
122 organization. Each member who is appointed by a state grazing board serves a term
123 of 4 years. (NRS 563.290, 563.320, 563.340) Section 50 of this bill requires, to the
124 extent practicable, that the terms of the appointed members of the Commission are
125 staggered.
126 Existing law creates the Nevada High-Speed Rail Authority and requires the
127 Authority to select a franchisee for the construction and operation of a high-speed

131 Assault. The Advisory Committee is required to study certain practices and make
132 recommendations relating to sexual assault victims’ advocates, the rights of
133 survivors of sexual assault and the effectiveness of a certain statewide program to

36 extension work, as entered in the budget described in this section,
37 must not be more than a sum equal to the proceeds of 1 cent of such
38 county tax rate; but when the proceeds of a 1-cent tax rate are
39 insufficient to carry out the provisions of the budget previously
40 adopted, the Director of the [Agricultural] University of Nevada
41 Cooperative Extension [Department] of the Public Service Division
42 of the Nevada System of Higher Education is authorized to
43 supplement the State’s cooperative share from the funds as may be
44 made available in the Public Service Division Fund of the Nevada
