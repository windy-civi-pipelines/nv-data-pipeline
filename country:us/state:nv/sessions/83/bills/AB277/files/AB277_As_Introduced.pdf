Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates the Department of Taxation, which has various powers and
2 duties related to the administration and collection of certain taxes, fees, assessments
3 and other amounts of money and the imposition of disciplinary actions. (Chapter
4 360 of NRS) Existing law makes confidential and privileged the records and files of
5 the Department concerning the administration and collection of those taxes, fees,
6 assessments and other amounts and the imposition of disciplinary action, but
7 authorizes the disclosure of such records and files under certain circumstances.
8 (NRS 360.255) Existing law provides for the taxation of the net proceeds of
9 minerals extracted in this State based upon the actual net proceeds from the
10 preceding calendar year. (NRS 362.100-362.240) Existing law requires the
11 Department to investigate and determine the net proceeds of all minerals extracted.
12 (NRS 362.100) In making the investigation and determination, existing law
13 requires the Department to compute the gross yield and net proceeds of the
14 extraction of all minerals using all obtainable data, evidence and reports, including
15 a certain statement required to be filed by every person extracting any mineral in
16 this State or receiving any royalty. (NRS 362.110, 362.120) This bill authorizes the
17 disclosure of the records and files of the Department concerning the administration
18 and collection of certain taxes, fees, assessments and other amounts and the
19 imposition of disciplinary action related to the computation of the gross yield and
20 net proceeds of the extraction of all minerals in this State.
