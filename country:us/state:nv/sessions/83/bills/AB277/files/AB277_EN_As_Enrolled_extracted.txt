Existing law creates the Department of Taxation, which has various powers and
duties related to the administration and collection of certain taxes, fees, assessments

authorizes the disclosure of such records and files under certain circumstances.
(NRS 360.255) Existing law provides for the taxation of the net proceeds of
minerals extracted in this State based upon the actual net proceeds from the
preceding calendar year. (NRS 362.100-362.240) Existing law requires the
Department to investigate and determine the net proceeds of all minerals extracted.
(NRS 362.100) In making the investigation and determination, existing law
requires the Department to compute the gross yield and net proceeds of the
extraction of all minerals using all obtainable data, evidence and reports, including
a certain statement required to be filed by every person extracting any mineral in
this State or receiving any royalty. (NRS 362.110, 362.120) This bill authorizes the
disclosure of the records and files of the Department concerning the administration
and collection of certain taxes, fees, assessments and other amounts and the
imposition of disciplinary action related to the computation of the gross yield and
net proceeds of the extraction of all minerals in this State.
