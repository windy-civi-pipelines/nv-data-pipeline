(BDR 43-250)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public safety; revising provisions governing
blood tests of deceased crash victims; revising provisions
governing the submittal of crash reports to the
Department of Public Safety; revising provisions
governing the central repository to track data
electronically concerning vehicle crashes on a statewide
basis that is created and maintained by the Department;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires a coroner, or other public official performing like duties,
2 in all cases in which a death has occurred as a result of a crash involving a motor
3 vehicle, to: (1) cause to be drawn from each decedent a blood sample to be
4 analyzed for the presence and concentration of alcohol within 8 hours of the crash;
5 and (2) report to the Department of Motor Vehicles the findings of such a blood
6 sample within 30 days after the death. (NRS 484C.170) Section 1 of this bill: (1)
7 requires the blood sample to also be analyzed for the presence and concentration of
8 certain substances which are commonly misused, as determined by the coroner or
9 other public official; (2) removes the requirement that such a blood sample be
10 drawn within 8 hours of the crash; and (3) removes the requirement that the
11 findings of such a blood sample be reported to the Department within 30 days after
12 the death, and instead requires the coroner or other public official to report the
13 findings to the Department upon receipt of the findings.
14 Existing law requires every police officer who investigates a vehicle crash and
15 prepares a report as a result to forward the written or electronic report to the
16 Department of Public Safety within 10 days after the investigation of the crash.
17 Existing law requires the Department to record the data collected from such reports

18 in a central repository to track data electronically concerning vehicle crashes on a
19 statewide basis. (NRS 484E.110) Section 2 of this bill requires a police officer to
20 submit the report through the electronic crash reporting system maintained by the
21 Department within 10 days after: (1) the date of the crash; or (2) the date of death
22 of a person involved in the crash if the death occurred as a result of the crash.
23 Existing law requires the Department of Public Safety to prepare forms for
24 crash reports made by police officers to the Department and to supply such forms to
25 law enforcement agencies and other appropriate persons upon request. (NRS
26 484E.120) To reflect the changes made in section 2 requiring that a crash report to
27 the Department be submitted through the electronic crash reporting system, section
28 3 of this bill requires the Department to prescribe the form for crash reports and
29 make the form available to law enforcement agencies and other appropriate
30 persons.
