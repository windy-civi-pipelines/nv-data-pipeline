9 Department of Public Safety within 10 days after the investigation of the crash.

11 in a central repository to track data electronically concerning vehicle crashes on a
12 statewide basis. (NRS 484E.110) Section 2 of this bill requires a police officer to
13 submit the report through the electronic crash reporting system maintained by the
14 Department within 10 days after: (1) the date of the crash; or (2) the date of death
