FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public safety; [requiring a] revising provisions governing
blood [test] tests of [a] deceased crash [victim to include an analysis of
the presence and concentration of certain prohibited substances;]
victims; revising provisions governing the submittal of crash reports to
the Department of Public Safety; revising provisions governing the
central repository to track data electronically concerning vehicle
crashes on a statewide basis that is created and maintained by the
Department; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires a coroner, or other public official performing like duties, in all cases
2 in which a death has occurred as a result of a crash involving a motor vehicle, to : (1) cause to
3 be drawn from each decedent a blood sample to be analyzed for the presence and
4 concentration of alcohol [.] within 8 hours of the crash; and (2) report to the Department
5 of Motor Vehicles the findings of such a blood sample within 30 days after the death.
6 (NRS 484C.170) Section 1 of this bill: (1) requires the blood sample to also be analyzed for
7 the presence and concentration of certain [prohibited] substances [.] which are commonly
8 misused, as determined by the coroner or other public official; (2) removes the
9 requirement that such a blood sample be drawn within 8 hours of the crash; and (3)
10 removes the requirement that the findings of such a blood sample be reported to the
11 Department within 30 days after the death, and instead requires the coroner or other
12 public official to report the findings to the Department upon receipt of the findings.
13 Existing law requires every police officer who investigates a vehicle crash and prepares a
14 report as a result to forward the written or electronic report to the Department of Public Safety
15 within 10 days after the investigation of the crash. Existing law requires the Department to
16 record the data collected from such reports in a central repository to track data electronically
17 concerning vehicle crashes on a statewide basis. (NRS 484E.110) Section 2 of this bill
18 requires a police officer to submit the report through the electronic crash reporting system
19 maintained by the Department within 10 days after: (1) the date of the crash; or (2) the date of
20 death of a person involved in the crash if the death occurred as a result of the crash.
21 Existing law requires the Department of Public Safety to prepare forms for crash reports
22 made by police officers to the Department and to supply such forms to law enforcement
Assembly Amendment No. 171 to Assembly Bill No. 55 Page 4
23 agencies and other appropriate persons upon request. (NRS 484E.120) To reflect the changes
24 made in section 2 requiring that a crash report to the Department be submitted through the
25 electronic crash reporting system, section 3 of this bill requires the Department to prescribe
26 the form for crash reports and make the form available to law enforcement agencies and other
27 appropriate persons.
