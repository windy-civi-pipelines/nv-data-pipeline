Referred to Committee on Education
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to educational personnel. (BDR 34-519)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to educational personnel; authorizing a person who holds a
license to teach in another state to be hired as a teacher in this State on
a certain provisional basis if he or she satisfies certain requirements;
requiring the Commission on Professional Standards in Education to
prescribe certain regulations concerning the licensure of teachers,
school counselors, school nurses and school social workers; [requiring
the Department of Education to waive certain fees for licensure for
certain substitute teachers;] eliminating the authority of the State Board
of Education to disapprove of regulations adopted by the Commission;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates the Commission on Professional Standards in Education and requires
2 the Commission to prescribe regulations for licensing teachers and other educational
3 personnel. (NRS 391.011, 391.019) Under existing law, such regulations are required to
4 provide for the reciprocal licensure of educational personnel from other states. (NRS 391.032)
5 Section 1 of this bill authorizes the board of trustees of a school district or the governing body
6 of a charter school to employ as a teacher, on a provisional basis not to exceed 1 year, a
7 person not licensed as a teacher in this State if the person: (1) holds a license in good standing
8 from another state; (2) has submitted an application to receive a license to teach in this State;
9 and (3) has completed the background investigation the employing school district is required
10 to conduct. Section 1 additionally requires a school district or charter school to, at the
11 time such a person is hired, report the hiring to the Department of Education.
12 Section 2 of this bill requires that the regulations adopted by the Commission also
13 prescribe qualifications for a person to use work experience or a license in an area of career
14 and technical education to receive an endorsement in career and technical education without
15 repeating certain requirements. Additionally, section 2 requires such regulations to authorize a
16 person who is employed by a public school to provide support and other services relating to
17 school counseling and is enrolled in a program that would allow the person to obtain a license
18 or endorsement as a school counselor to simultaneously complete any required internship or
19 practicum hours for the purpose of obtaining such a license or endorsement. Section 2 also
20 requires such regulations to authorize a person to serve as a school nurse or school social
21 worker without the applicable endorsement if the person: (1) has applied for such an
Assembly Amendment No. 885 to Assembly Bill No. 49 First Reprint Page 4
22 endorsement and is awaiting the issuance or denial of the endorsement; and (2) holds certain
23 valid licenses issued by the State Board of Nursing or the Board of Examiners for Social
24 Workers, as applicable. Furthermore, section 2 provides that such regulations adopted by
25 the Commission must require a school district who employs such a person to, at the time
26 the person is hired, report the hiring to the Department. Section 4 of this bill makes a
27 conforming change to authorize such a registered nurse to be employed as a school nurse
28 without an endorsement as a school nurse.
29 [Section 3 of this bill requires a reduction in the fee for a license to teach for certain
30 applicants who are substitute teachers.]
31 Existing law authorizes the State Board of Education to disapprove of any regulation that
32 is adopted by the Commission on Professional Standards in Education. (NRS 391.027)
33 Section 4.5 of this bill eliminates the authority of the State Board to take such an action.
34 Sections 2, 2.3 and 2.7 of this bill make conforming changes to remove references to this
35 authority in other provisions of law.

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to educational personnel; authorizing a person who holds a
license to teach in another state to be hired as a teacher in this State on
a certain provisional basis if he or she satisfies certain requirements;
requiring the Commission on Professional Standards in Education to
prescribe certain regulations concerning the licensure of teachers,
school counselors, school nurses and school social workers; [requiring
the Department of Education to waive certain fees for licensure for
certain substitute teachers;] eliminating the authority of the State Board
of Education to disapprove of regulations adopted by the Commission;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates the Commission on Professional Standards in Education and requires
2 the Commission to prescribe regulations for licensing teachers and other educational
3 personnel. (NRS 391.011, 391.019) Under existing law, such regulations are required to
4 provide for the reciprocal licensure of educational personnel from other states. (NRS 391.032)
5 Section 1 of this bill authorizes the board of trustees of a school district or the governing body
6 of a charter school to employ as a teacher, on a provisional basis not to exceed 1 year, a
7 person not licensed as a teacher in this State if the person: (1) holds a license in good standing
8 from another state; (2) has submitted an application to receive a license to teach in this State;
9 and (3) has completed the background investigation the employing school district is required
10 to conduct. Section 1 additionally requires a school district or charter school to, at the
11 time such a person is hired, report the hiring to the Department of Education.
12 Section 2 of this bill requires that the regulations adopted by the Commission also
13 prescribe qualifications for a person to use work experience or a license in an area of career
14 and technical education to receive an endorsement in career and technical education without
15 repeating certain requirements. Additionally, section 2 requires such regulations to authorize a
16 person who is employed by a public school to provide support and other services relating to
17 school counseling and is enrolled in a program that would allow the person to obtain a license
18 or endorsement as a school counselor to simultaneously complete any required internship or
19 practicum hours for the purpose of obtaining such a license or endorsement. Section 2 also
20 requires such regulations to authorize a person to serve as a school nurse or school social
21 worker without the applicable endorsement if the person: (1) has applied for such an

Assembly Amendment No. 885 to Assembly Bill No. 49 First Reprint Page 4
22 endorsement and is awaiting the issuance or denial of the endorsement; and (2) holds certain
23 valid licenses issued by the State Board of Nursing or the Board of Examiners for Social
24 Workers, as applicable. Furthermore, section 2 provides that such regulations adopted by
25 the Commission must require a school district who employs such a person to, at the time
26 the person is hired, report the hiring to the Department. Section 4 of this bill makes a
27 conforming change to authorize such a registered nurse to be employed as a school nurse
28 without an endorsement as a school nurse.
29 [Section 3 of this bill requires a reduction in the fee for a license to teach for certain
30 applicants who are substitute teachers.]
31 Existing law authorizes the State Board of Education to disapprove of any regulation that
32 is adopted by the Commission on Professional Standards in Education. (NRS 391.027)
33 Section 4.5 of this bill eliminates the authority of the State Board to take such an action.
34 Sections 2, 2.3 and 2.7 of this bill make conforming changes to remove references to this
35 authority in other provisions of law.
