(ON BEHALF OF THE WASHOE COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT)
PREFILED NOVEMBER 19, 2024
_______________
Referred to Committee on Education
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to educational personnel. (BDR 34-519)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to educational personnel; authorizing a person who holds a
license to teach in [certain states] another state to be hired as a teacher
in this State on a certain provisional basis if he or she satisfies certain
requirements; [authorizing a person to simultaneously enroll in
multiple programs for an alternative route to licensure;] requiring the
Commission on Professional Standards in Education to prescribe
certain regulations concerning the licensure of teachers, school
counselors, school nurses and school social workers; requiring the
Department of Education to waive certain fees for licensure for
certain substitute teachers; eliminating the authority of the State
Board of Education to disapprove of regulations adopted by the
Commission; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates the Commission on Professional Standards in Education and requires
2 the Commission to prescribe regulations for licensing teachers and other educational
3 personnel. (NRS 391.011, 391.019) Under existing law, such regulations are required to
4 provide for the reciprocal licensure of educational personnel from other states. (NRS 391.032)
5 Section 1 of this bill [requires the Commission to compile a list of states in which the
6 requirements and qualifications to obtain a license to teach are equivalent to the requirements
7 and qualifications to obtain a license to teach in this State. Section 1 additionally] authorizes
8 the board of trustees of a school district or the governing body of a charter school to employ
9 as a teacher , on a provisional basis not to exceed 1 year, a person not licensed as a teacher
10 in this State if the person: (1) holds a license in good standing from [a state included on the
11 list compiled by the Commission;] another state; (2) has submitted an application to receive
12 a license to teach in this State; and (3) has completed the background investigation the
13 employing school district is required to conduct.
14 Section 2 of this bill requires that the regulations adopted by the Commission also
15 [prescribe qualifications for a person who holds certain licenses to teach to receive a license to
16 teach elementary education without repeating previously completed requirements or satisfying
17 additional requirements. Section 2 additionally requires such regulations to] prescribe
18 qualifications for a person to use work experience or a license in an area of career and
19 technical education to receive an endorsement in career and technical education without
Assembly Amendment No. 161 to Assembly Bill No. 49 Page 4
20 repeating certain requirements. Additionally, section 2 requires such regulations to
21 authorize a person who is employed by a public school to provide support and other
22 services relating to school counseling and is enrolled in a program that would allow the
23 person to obtain a license or endorsement as a school counselor to simultaneously
24 complete any required internship or practicum hours for the purpose of obtaining such
25 a license or endorsement. Section 2 also requires such regulations to authorize a person to
26 serve as a school nurse or school social worker without the applicable endorsement if the
27 person: (1) has applied for such an endorsement [but the endorsement has not yet been
28 approved or denied;] and is awaiting the issuance or denial of the endorsement; and (2)
29 holds certain valid licenses issued by the State Board of Nursing or the Board of Examiners
30 for Social Workers, as applicable. Section 4 of this bill makes a conforming change to
31 authorize such a registered nurse to be employed as a school nurse without an endorsement as
32 a school nurse.
33 [Existing law requires the Commission to prescribe regulations that set forth the
34 qualifications for licensing teachers through an alternative route to licensure. (NRS 391.019)
35 Section 2 requires such regulations to authorize a person to simultaneously enroll in multiple
36 programs for an alternative route to licensure.]
37 Section 3 of this bill requires a reduction in the fee for a license to teach for certain
38 applicants who are substitute teachers.
39 Existing law authorizes the State Board of Education to disapprove of any
40 regulation that is adopted by the Commission on Professional Standards in Education.
41 (NRS 391.027) Section 4.5 of this bill eliminates the authority of the State Board to take
42 such an action. Sections 2, 2.3 and 2.7 of this bill make conforming changes to remove
43 references to this authority in other provisions of law.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 391 of NRS is hereby amended by adding thereto a new
2 section to read as follows:

7 that are substantially equivalent to the requirements and qualifications for such a
8 license in this State.
9 2.] Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the board of trustees of a
10 school district or the governing body of a charter school may, on a provisional

FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to educational personnel; authorizing a person who holds a
license to teach in [certain states] another state to be hired as a teacher
in this State on a certain provisional basis if he or she satisfies certain
requirements; [authorizing a person to simultaneously enroll in
multiple programs for an alternative route to licensure;] requiring the
Commission on Professional Standards in Education to prescribe
certain regulations concerning the licensure of teachers, school
counselors, school nurses and school social workers; requiring the
Department of Education to waive certain fees for licensure for
certain substitute teachers; eliminating the authority of the State
Board of Education to disapprove of regulations adopted by the
Commission; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates the Commission on Professional Standards in Education and requires
2 the Commission to prescribe regulations for licensing teachers and other educational
3 personnel. (NRS 391.011, 391.019) Under existing law, such regulations are required to
4 provide for the reciprocal licensure of educational personnel from other states. (NRS 391.032)
5 Section 1 of this bill [requires the Commission to compile a list of states in which the
6 requirements and qualifications to obtain a license to teach are equivalent to the requirements
7 and qualifications to obtain a license to teach in this State. Section 1 additionally] authorizes
8 the board of trustees of a school district or the governing body of a charter school to employ
9 as a teacher , on a provisional basis not to exceed 1 year, a person not licensed as a teacher
10 in this State if the person: (1) holds a license in good standing from [a state included on the
11 list compiled by the Commission;] another state; (2) has submitted an application to receive
12 a license to teach in this State; and (3) has completed the background investigation the
13 employing school district is required to conduct.
14 Section 2 of this bill requires that the regulations adopted by the Commission also
15 [prescribe qualifications for a person who holds certain licenses to teach to receive a license to
16 teach elementary education without repeating previously completed requirements or satisfying
17 additional requirements. Section 2 additionally requires such regulations to] prescribe
18 qualifications for a person to use work experience or a license in an area of career and
19 technical education to receive an endorsement in career and technical education without

Assembly Amendment No. 161 to Assembly Bill No. 49 Page 4
20 repeating certain requirements. Additionally, section 2 requires such regulations to
21 authorize a person who is employed by a public school to provide support and other
22 services relating to school counseling and is enrolled in a program that would allow the
23 person to obtain a license or endorsement as a school counselor to simultaneously
24 complete any required internship or practicum hours for the purpose of obtaining such
25 a license or endorsement. Section 2 also requires such regulations to authorize a person to
26 serve as a school nurse or school social worker without the applicable endorsement if the
27 person: (1) has applied for such an endorsement [but the endorsement has not yet been
28 approved or denied;] and is awaiting the issuance or denial of the endorsement; and (2)
29 holds certain valid licenses issued by the State Board of Nursing or the Board of Examiners
30 for Social Workers, as applicable. Section 4 of this bill makes a conforming change to
31 authorize such a registered nurse to be employed as a school nurse without an endorsement as
32 a school nurse.
33 [Existing law requires the Commission to prescribe regulations that set forth the
34 qualifications for licensing teachers through an alternative route to licensure. (NRS 391.019)
35 Section 2 requires such regulations to authorize a person to simultaneously enroll in multiple
36 programs for an alternative route to licensure.]
37 Section 3 of this bill requires a reduction in the fee for a license to teach for certain
38 applicants who are substitute teachers.
39 Existing law authorizes the State Board of Education to disapprove of any
40 regulation that is adopted by the Commission on Professional Standards in Education.
41 (NRS 391.027) Section 4.5 of this bill eliminates the authority of the State Board to take
42 such an action. Sections 2, 2.3 and 2.7 of this bill make conforming changes to remove
43 references to this authority in other provisions of law.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 391 of NRS is hereby amended by adding thereto a new
2 section to read as follows:

7 that are substantially equivalent to the requirements and qualifications for such a
8 license in this State.
9 2.] Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the board of trustees of a
10 school district or the governing body of a charter school may, on a provisional
