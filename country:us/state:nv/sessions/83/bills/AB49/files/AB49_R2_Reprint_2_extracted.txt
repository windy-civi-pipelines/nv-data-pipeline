(ON BEHALF OF THE WASHOE COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT)

SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to educational personnel.
(BDR 34-519)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to educational personnel; authorizing a person
who holds a license to teach in another state to be hired as
a teacher in this State on a certain provisional basis if he
or she satisfies certain requirements; requiring the
Commission on Professional Standards in Education to
prescribe certain regulations concerning the licensure of
teachers, school counselors, school nurses and school
social workers; eliminating the authority of the State
Board of Education to disapprove of regulations adopted
by the Commission; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates the Commission on Professional Standards in Education
2 and requires the Commission to prescribe regulations for licensing teachers and
3 other educational personnel. (NRS 391.011, 391.019) Under existing law, such
4 regulations are required to provide for the reciprocal licensure of educational
5 personnel from other states. (NRS 391.032) Section 1 of this bill authorizes the
6 board of trustees of a school district or the governing body of a charter school to
7 employ as a teacher, on a provisional basis not to exceed 1 year, a person not
8 licensed as a teacher in this State if the person: (1) holds a license in good standing
9 from another state; (2) has submitted an application to receive a license to teach in
10 this State; and (3) has completed the background investigation the employing
11 school district is required to conduct. Section 1 additionally requires a school
12 district or charter school to, at the time such a person is hired, report the hiring to
13 the Department of Education.

*AB49_R2*
– 2 –
14 Section 2 of this bill requires that the regulations adopted by the Commission
15 also prescribe qualifications for a person to use work experience or a license in an
16 area of career and technical education to receive an endorsement in career and
17 technical education without repeating certain requirements. Additionally, section 2
18 requires such regulations to authorize a person who is employed by a public school
19 to provide support and other services relating to school counseling and is enrolled
20 in a program that would allow the person to obtain a license or endorsement as a
21 school counselor to simultaneously complete any required internship or practicum
22 hours for the purpose of obtaining such a license or endorsement. Section 2 also
23 requires such regulations to authorize a person to serve as a school nurse or school
24 social worker without the applicable endorsement if the person: (1) has applied for
25 such an endorsement and is awaiting the issuance or denial of the endorsement; and
26 (2) holds certain valid licenses issued by the State Board of Nursing or the Board of
27 Examiners for Social Workers, as applicable. Furthermore, section 2 provides that
28 such regulations adopted by the Commission must require a school district who
29 employs such a person to, at the time the person is hired, report the hiring to the
30 Department. Section 4 of this bill makes a conforming change to authorize such a
31 registered nurse to be employed as a school nurse without an endorsement as a
32 school nurse.
33 Existing law authorizes the State Board of Education to disapprove of any
34 regulation that is adopted by the Commission on Professional Standards in
35 Education. (NRS 391.027) Section 4.5 of this bill eliminates the authority of the
36 State Board to take such an action. Sections 2, 2.3 and 2.7 of this bill make
37 conforming changes to remove references to this authority in other provisions of
38 law.

14 Section 2 of this bill requires that the regulations adopted by the Commission
15 also prescribe qualifications for a person to use work experience or a license in an
16 area of career and technical education to receive an endorsement in career and
17 technical education without repeating certain requirements. Additionally, section 2
18 requires such regulations to authorize a person who is employed by a public school
19 to provide support and other services relating to school counseling and is enrolled
