AN ACT relating to educational personnel; authorizing a person
who holds a license to teach in certain states to be hired as
a teacher in this State if he or she satisfies certain
requirements; authorizing a person to simultaneously
enroll in multiple programs for an alternative route to
licensure; requiring the Commission on Professional
Standards in Education to prescribe certain regulations
concerning the licensure of teachers, school nurses and
school social workers; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates the Commission on Professional Standards in Education
2 and requires the Commission to prescribe regulations for licensing teachers and
3 other educational personnel. (NRS 391.011, 391.019) Under existing law, such
4 regulations are required to provide for the reciprocal licensure of educational
5 personnel from other states. (NRS 391.032) Section 1 of this bill requires the
6 Commission to compile a list of states in which the requirements and qualifications
7 to obtain a license to teach are equivalent to the requirements and qualifications to
8 obtain a license to teach in this State. Section 1 additionally authorizes the board of
9 trustees of a school district or the governing body of a charter school to employ as a
10 teacher a person not licensed as a teacher in this State if the person: (1) holds a
11 license in good standing from a state included on the list compiled by the
12 Commission; (2) has submitted an application to receive a license to teach in this
13 State; and (3) has completed the background investigation the employing school
14 district is required to conduct.
15 Section 2 of this bill requires that the regulations adopted by the Commission
16 also prescribe qualifications for a person who holds certain licenses to teach to
-

– 2 –
17 receive a license to teach elementary education without repeating previously
18 completed requirements or satisfying additional requirements. Section 2
19 additionally requires such regulations to prescribe qualifications for a person to use
20 work experience or a license in an area of career and technical education to receive
21 an endorsement in career and technical education without repeating certain
22 requirements. Section 2 also requires such regulations to authorize a person to
23 serve as a school nurse or school social worker without the applicable endorsement
24 if the person: (1) has applied for such an endorsement but the endorsement has not
25 yet been approved or denied; and (2) holds certain valid licenses issued by the State
26 Board of Nursing or the Board of Examiners for Social Workers, as applicable.
27 Section 4 of this bill makes a conforming change to authorize such a registered
28 nurse to be employed as a school nurse without an endorsement as a school nurse.
29 Existing law requires the Commission to prescribe regulations that set forth the
30 qualifications for licensing teachers through an alternative route to licensure. (NRS
31 391.019) Section 2 requires such regulations to authorize a person to
32 simultaneously enroll in multiple programs for an alternative route to licensure.
33 Section 3 of this bill requires a reduction in the fee for a license to teach for
34 certain applicants who are substitute teachers.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 391 of NRS is hereby amended by adding
2 thereto a new section to read as follows:

4 update a list of each state that the Commission determines has
5 requirements and qualifications for a license to teach early
6 childhood education, elementary education, middle school or
7 junior high school education, secondary education or special
8 education that are substantially equivalent to the requirements
9 and qualifications for such a license in this State.
10 2. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the board of
11 trustees of a school district or the governing body of a charter
12 school may, on a provisional basis not to exceed 1 year, employ as
13 a teacher a person who is not licensed to teach pursuant to this
14 chapter if the person:
15 (a) Is licensed in good standing as a teacher in a state included
16 on the most recent list developed or updated by the Commission
17 pursuant to subsection 1;
18 (b) Has submitted an application for the issuance of a license
