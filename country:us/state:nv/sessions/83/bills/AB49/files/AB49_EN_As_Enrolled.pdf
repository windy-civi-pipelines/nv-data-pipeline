Assembly Bill No. 49–Committee on Education
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to educational personnel; authorizing a person
who holds a license to teach in another state to be hired as a
teacher in this State on a certain provisional basis if he or she
satisfies certain requirements; requiring the Commission on
Professional Standards in Education to prescribe certain
regulations concerning the licensure of teachers, school
counselors, school nurses and school social workers;
eliminating the authority of the State Board of Education to
disapprove of regulations adopted by the Commission; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law creates the Commission on Professional Standards in Education
and requires the Commission to prescribe regulations for licensing teachers and
other educational personnel. (NRS 391.011, 391.019) Under existing law, such
regulations are required to provide for the reciprocal licensure of educational
personnel from other states. (NRS 391.032) Section 1 of this bill authorizes the
board of trustees of a school district or the governing body of a charter school to
employ as a teacher, on a provisional basis not to exceed 1 year, a person not
licensed as a teacher in this State if the person: (1) holds a license in good standing
from another state; (2) has submitted an application to receive a license to teach in
this State; and (3) has completed the background investigation the employing
school district is required to conduct. Section 1 additionally requires a school
district or charter school to, at the time such a person is hired, report the hiring to
the Department of Education.
Section 2 of this bill requires that the regulations adopted by the Commission
also prescribe qualifications for a person to use work experience or a license in an
area of career and technical education to receive an endorsement in career and
technical education without repeating certain requirements. Additionally, section 2
requires such regulations to authorize a person who is employed by a public school
to provide support and other services relating to school counseling and is enrolled
in a program that would allow the person to obtain a license or endorsement as a
school counselor to simultaneously complete any required internship or practicum
hours for the purpose of obtaining such a license or endorsement. Section 2 also
requires such regulations to authorize a person to serve as a school nurse or school
social worker without the applicable endorsement if the person: (1) has applied for
such an endorsement and is awaiting the issuance or denial of the endorsement; and
(2) holds certain valid licenses issued by the State Board of Nursing or the Board of
Examiners for Social Workers, as applicable. Furthermore, section 2 provides that
such regulations adopted by the Commission must require a school district who
employs such a person to, at the time the person is hired, report the hiring to the
Department. Section 4 of this bill makes a conforming change to authorize such a
registered nurse to be employed as a school nurse without an endorsement as a
school nurse.
Existing law authorizes the State Board of Education to disapprove of any
regulation that is adopted by the Commission on Professional Standards in
Education. (NRS 391.027) Section 4.5 of this bill eliminates the authority of the
State Board to take such an action. Sections 2, 2.3 and 2.7 of this bill make

conforming changes to remove references to this authority in other provisions of
law.
