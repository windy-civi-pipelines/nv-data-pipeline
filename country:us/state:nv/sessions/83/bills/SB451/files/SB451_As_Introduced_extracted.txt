EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to taxation; extending the imposition of a property
tax rate in unincorporated areas of Clark County and the
City of Las Vegas for the purpose of employing police
officers with the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police
Department; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, there is a property tax of 28 cents on each $100 of assessed
2 valuation imposed in a taxing district comprising the unincorporated areas of Clark
3 County and the City of Las Vegas for the purpose of employing peace officers with
4 the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department. This property tax is composed of:
5 (1) a rate of 8 cents on each $100 of assessed valuation in the taxing district, which
6 was approved by the voters of the taxing district at the 1988 General Election and
7 which is permanent; and (2) a rate of 20 cents on each $100 of assessed valuation in
8 the taxing district, which was approved by the voters of the taxing district at the
9 1996 General Election and which expires on June 30, 2027. (NRS 354.5982;
10 chapter 817, Statutes of Nevada 1987, at page 2284, as amended by chapter 585,
11 Statutes of Nevada 1997, at page 2865, chapter 658, Statutes of Nevada 1995, at
12 page 2534, as amended by chapter 585, Statutes of Nevada 1997, at page 2865)
13 Sections 1 and 4 of this bill provide for: (1) the continued imposition of the
14 property tax rate of 20 cents on each $100 of assessed valuation in the taxing
15 district, for the period beginning on July 1, 2027, and ending June 30, 2057; and (2)
16 the continued use of the proceeds of this property tax for the purpose of employing
17 police officers with the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department. Section 2 of
18 this bill makes a conforming change to ensure that the property tax rate continued
19 pursuant to this bill is apportioned to the unincorporated areas of Clark County and
20 the City of Las Vegas in the same manner as the existing property tax rate.

21 Existing law provides for a partial abatement of property taxes, which
22 has the effect of establishing an annual cap on increases of property taxes.
23 (NRS 361.4722-361.4724) However, under existing law, certain property tax rates
24 are exempt from this partial abatement, including, without limitation, a new or
25 increased property tax rate that a taxing entity is required to impose or increase by
26 any legislative act which becomes effective after April 6, 2005. Thus, with certain
27 exceptions, such property tax rates are not included in the calculation used to
28 determine the amount of property taxes abated under the existing law establishing
29 an annual cap on increases of property taxes. (NRS 361.4726) Because the property
30 tax rate of 20 cents on each $100 of assessed valuation, which was approved at the
31 1996 General Election for the purpose of employing police officers with the Las
32 Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, was imposed before April 6, 2005, section
33 1 also provides that the property tax rate extended by that section is not exempt
34 from the partial abatement of property taxes and, thus, is required to be included in
35 the calculation used to determine the amount of property taxes abated.
36 Section 3 of this bill makes a conforming change to continue the exemption of
37 the property tax rate extended by section 1 from provisions of existing law limiting
38 the amount of property tax revenue that may be received by certain local
39 governments.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 280 of NRS is hereby amended by adding
2 thereto a new section to read as follows:
3 1. For each fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2027,
4 and ending before July 1, 2057, the board of county
5 commissioners, the city council and any other governing body of
6 each taxing district in the taxable area shall impose a tax at the
7 rate of 20 cents on each $100 of assessed valuation within the
8 taxable area for the support of the department for the purpose of
9 employing additional police officers.
10 2. All county officers charged with the duty of collecting ad
11 valorem taxes shall collect the tax imposed pursuant to this section
12 in the same form and manner, and with the same interest and
13 penalties, as other ad valorem taxes are collected, and shall pay all
14 revenue generated by the tax, including all interest and penalties,
15 to the department upon collection.
16 3. The committee shall authorize the department to use the
17 proceeds only for the purpose of employing additional police
18 officers and the incurrence of related costs.
19 4. Any tax that may be imposed pursuant to this section is not
20 subject to the limitation provided in NRS 354.59811 and is not
21 exempt from any partial abatement from taxation provided
22 pursuant to NRS 361.4722, 361.4723 or 361.4724.
23 Sec. 2. NRS 280.201 is hereby amended to read as follows:
24 280.201 1. The funding apportionment plan must exclude the
25 cost of:
-

1 (a) Operating and maintaining a county or a branch county jail;
2 (b) A rural program of resident officers, where applicable; and
3 (c) Any program of contract services which is totally funded by
4 the contracting agency or entity.
5  The costs described in paragraphs (a) and (b) are a proper charge
6 against the county. The capital costs of building a county or a
7 branch county jail are the responsibility of the board of county
8 commissioners.
9 2. If a department operates a program for school crossing
10 guards, each participating political subdivision must pay the cost of
11 operating the positions located within its jurisdiction.
12 3. The funding apportionment plan must apportion the
13 anticipated costs of operating and maintaining the department, and
14 capital costs, after deducting all anticipated revenue internally
15 generated by the department, among the participating political
16 subdivisions according to the formula developed by the department
17 pursuant to this section.
18 4. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 1, an additional
19 tax ad valorem that is levied pursuant to the approval of the voters
20 or pursuant to section 1 of this act must be levied at a uniform rate
21 in the unincorporated area of the county and in each participating
22 city.
23 5. In developing the formula, the department must divide its
24 budget into the following functional areas:
25 (a) Activities which are the responsibility of any one of the
26 participating political subdivisions.
27 (b) Contract services which are performed solely for another
28 agency or entity.
29 (c) Administrative or supporting activities.
30 (d) The remaining activities, services or programs are to be
31 allocated to those functional areas which are to be jointly funded by
32 the participating political subdivision.
33  Contract services which are performed solely for another agency
34 or entity must each be identified as a separate functional area.
35 6. The department must identify the bureaus, sections,
36 divisions and groups that are assigned to each functional area. Each
37 functional area must be a separate accounting unit within the budget
38 of the department for the purpose of apportioning the cost among
39 the participating political subdivisions.
40 7. The costs of the activities of administration or support must
41 be allocated to the other functional area to which they apply in the
42 ratio that the cost of each functional area bears to the combined
43 costs of the other functional areas.
44 8. The costs of each functional area which is to be jointly
45 funded, including the administrative and support costs allocated in
-
*SB451*
– 4 –
1 accordance with subsection 6, must be apportioned among the
2 participating political subdivisions as follows:
3 (a) The cost of uniformed functions in the field must be
4 apportioned on a percentage basis according to the comparative
5 cumulative, unweighted percentage relationship among the
6 participating political subdivisions of the permanent population of
7 the participating political subdivisions, as determined annually by
8 the Governor, the total number of calls for service which were
9 dispatched by the department in each participating political
10 subdivision, excluding:
11 (1) Calls for service with respect to felony crimes;
12 (2) Calls for service originating in those areas which were
13 served by a rural program of resident officers; and
14 (3) Calls for service originating from a program of contract
15 services which is totally funded by the contracting agency or entity,
16  and the total number of felonies which were reported in each
17 participating political subdivision, excluding reports of felonies
18 originating from a rural program of resident officers or a program of
19 contract services. The number of calls for service and the number of
20 felonies reported must have been made during the 12 months
21 preceding January 1 of the current fiscal year.
22 (b) The cost of the investigative function must be apportioned
23 on a percentage basis according to the comparative cumulative,
24 unweighted percentage relationship among the participating political
25 subdivisions of the total number of felonies which were reported in
26 each participating political subdivision during the 12 months
27 preceding January 1 of the current fiscal year.
28 9. For the purpose of subsection 8, the population attributable
29 to a county does not include the population of the cities within that
30 county or the population of those areas within that county which are
31 served by a rural program of resident officers.
32 10. The department shall maintain all of the statistics necessary
33 to effectuate the funding apportionment plan and shall maintain
34 accurate records in support of the determination required in order to
35 comply with this section.
36 11. If, in the initial year of the merger, the statistics necessary
37 to determine the funding apportionment plan for the remainder of
38 that year are incomplete, the department shall prepare a funding
39 apportionment plan for the remainder of that year based upon the
40 most accurate statistics available, and apply it as closely as possible
41 in the manner prescribed in this section. The fact that a budget, a
42 funding apportionment plan and a rural program of resident officers
43 are not prepared and submitted when due does not invalidate any of
44 them.

2 354.59811 1. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 244.377,
3 278C.260, 354.59813, 354.59815, 354.59818, 354.5982, 354.5987,
4 354.705, 354.723, 450.425, 450.760, 540A.265 and 543.600, and
5 section 1 of this act, for each fiscal year beginning on or after
6 July 1, 1989, the maximum amount of money that a local
7 government, except a school district, a district to provide a
8 telephone number for emergencies or a redevelopment agency, may
9 receive from taxes ad valorem, other than those attributable to the
10 net proceeds of minerals or those levied for the payment of bonded
11 indebtedness and interest thereon incurred as general long-term debt
12 of the issuer, or for the payment of obligations issued to pay the cost
13 of a water project pursuant to NRS 349.950, or for the payment of
14 obligations under a capital lease executed before April 30, 1981,
15 must be calculated as follows:
16 (a) The rate must be set so that when applied to the current fiscal
17 year’s assessed valuation of all property which was on the preceding
18 fiscal year’s assessment roll, together with the assessed valuation of
19 property on the central assessment roll which was allocated to the
20 local government, but excluding any assessed valuation attributable
21 to the net proceeds of minerals, assessed valuation attributable to a
22 redevelopment area and assessed valuation of a fire protection
23 district attributable to real property which is transferred from private
24 ownership to public ownership for the purpose of conservation, it
25 will produce 106 percent of the maximum revenue allowable from
26 taxes ad valorem for the preceding fiscal year, except that the rate so
27 determined must not be less than the rate allowed for the previous
28 fiscal year, except for any decrease attributable to the imposition of
29 a tax pursuant to NRS 354.59813 in the previous year.
30 (b) This rate must then be applied to the total assessed valuation,
31 excluding the assessed valuation attributable to the net proceeds of
32 minerals and the assessed valuation of a fire protection district
33 attributable to real property which is transferred from private
34 ownership to public ownership for the purpose of conservation, but
35 including new real property, possessory interests and mobile homes,
36 for the current fiscal year to determine the allowed revenue from
37 taxes ad valorem for the local government.
38 2. As used in this section, “general long-term debt” does not
39 include debt created for medium-term obligations pursuant to NRS
40 350.087 to 350.095, inclusive.
41 Sec. 4. 1. This section becomes effective upon passage and
42 approval.

SUMMARY—Extends a property tax imposed to employ police

Department. (BDR 22-359)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.

~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to taxation; extending the imposition of a property
tax rate in unincorporated areas of Clark County and the
City of Las Vegas for the purpose of employing police
officers with the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police
Department; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, there is a property tax of 28 cents on each $100 of assessed
2 valuation imposed in a taxing district comprising the unincorporated areas of Clark
3 County and the City of Las Vegas for the purpose of employing peace officers with
4 the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department. This property tax is composed of:
5 (1) a rate of 8 cents on each $100 of assessed valuation in the taxing district, which
6 was approved by the voters of the taxing district at the 1988 General Election and
7 which is permanent; and (2) a rate of 20 cents on each $100 of assessed valuation in
8 the taxing district, which was approved by the voters of the taxing district at the
9 1996 General Election and which expires on June 30, 2027. (NRS 354.5982;
10 chapter 817, Statutes of Nevada 1987, at page 2284, as amended by chapter 585,
11 Statutes of Nevada 1997, at page 2865, chapter 658, Statutes of Nevada 1995, at
12 page 2534, as amended by chapter 585, Statutes of Nevada 1997, at page 2865)
13 Sections 1 and 4 of this bill provide for: (1) the continued imposition of the
14 property tax rate of 20 cents on each $100 of assessed valuation in the taxing
15 district, for the period beginning on July 1, 2027, and ending June 30, 2057; and (2)
16 the continued use of the proceeds of this property tax for the purpose of employing
17 police officers with the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department. Section 2 of
18 this bill makes a conforming change to ensure that the property tax rate continued
19 pursuant to this bill is apportioned to the unincorporated areas of Clark County and
20 the City of Las Vegas in the same manner as the existing property tax rate.
-
*SB451*

– 2 –
21 Existing law provides for a partial abatement of property taxes, which
22 has the effect of establishing an annual cap on increases of property taxes.
23 (NRS 361.4722-361.4724) However, under existing law, certain property tax rates
24 are exempt from this partial abatement, including, without limitation, a new or
25 increased property tax rate that a taxing entity is required to impose or increase by
26 any legislative act which becomes effective after April 6, 2005. Thus, with certain
27 exceptions, such property tax rates are not included in the calculation used to
28 determine the amount of property taxes abated under the existing law establishing
29 an annual cap on increases of property taxes. (NRS 361.4726) Because the property
30 tax rate of 20 cents on each $100 of assessed valuation, which was approved at the
31 1996 General Election for the purpose of employing police officers with the Las
32 Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, was imposed before April 6, 2005, section
33 1 also provides that the property tax rate extended by that section is not exempt
34 from the partial abatement of property taxes and, thus, is required to be included in
35 the calculation used to determine the amount of property taxes abated.
36 Section 3 of this bill makes a conforming change to continue the exemption of
37 the property tax rate extended by section 1 from provisions of existing law limiting
38 the amount of property tax revenue that may be received by certain local
39 governments.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 280 of NRS is hereby amended by adding
2 thereto a new section to read as follows:
3 1. For each fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2027,
4 and ending before July 1, 2057, the board of county
5 commissioners, the city council and any other governing body of
6 each taxing district in the taxable area shall impose a tax at the
7 rate of 20 cents on each $100 of assessed valuation within the
8 taxable area for the support of the department for the purpose of
9 employing additional police officers.
10 2. All county officers charged with the duty of collecting ad
11 valorem taxes shall collect the tax imposed pursuant to this section
12 in the same form and manner, and with the same interest and
13 penalties, as other ad valorem taxes are collected, and shall pay all
14 revenue generated by the tax, including all interest and penalties,
15 to the department upon collection.
16 3. The committee shall authorize the department to use the
17 proceeds only for the purpose of employing additional police
18 officers and the incurrence of related costs.
19 4. Any tax that may be imposed pursuant to this section is not
20 subject to the limitation provided in NRS 354.59811 and is not
21 exempt from any partial abatement from taxation provided
22 pursuant to NRS 361.4722, 361.4723 or 361.4724.
23 Sec. 2. NRS 280.201 is hereby amended to read as follows:
24 280.201 1. The funding apportionment plan must exclude the
25 cost of:
-
*SB451*

– 3 –
1 (a) Operating and maintaining a county or a branch county jail;
2 (b) A rural program of resident officers, where applicable; and
3 (c) Any program of contract services which is totally funded by
4 the contracting agency or entity.
5  The costs described in paragraphs (a) and (b) are a proper charge
6 against the county. The capital costs of building a county or a
7 branch county jail are the responsibility of the board of county
8 commissioners.
9 2. If a department operates a program for school crossing
10 guards, each participating political subdivision must pay the cost of
11 operating the positions located within its jurisdiction.
12 3. The funding apportionment plan must apportion the
13 anticipated costs of operating and maintaining the department, and
14 capital costs, after deducting all anticipated revenue internally
15 generated by the department, among the participating political
16 subdivisions according to the formula developed by the department
17 pursuant to this section.
18 4. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 1, an additional
19 tax ad valorem that is levied pursuant to the approval of the voters
20 or pursuant to section 1 of this act must be levied at a uniform rate
21 in the unincorporated area of the county and in each participating
22 city.
23 5. In developing the formula, the department must divide its
24 budget into the following functional areas:
25 (a) Activities which are the responsibility of any one of the
26 participating political subdivisions.
27 (b) Contract services which are performed solely for another
28 agency or entity.
29 (c) Administrative or supporting activities.
30 (d) The remaining activities, services or programs are to be
31 allocated to those functional areas which are to be jointly funded by
32 the participating political subdivision.
33  Contract services which are performed solely for another agency
34 or entity must each be identified as a separate functional area.
35 6. The department must identify the bureaus, sections,
36 divisions and groups that are assigned to each functional area. Each
37 functional area must be a separate accounting unit within the budget
38 of the department for the purpose of apportioning the cost among
39 the participating political subdivisions.
40 7. The costs of the activities of administration or support must
41 be allocated to the other functional area to which they apply in the
42 ratio that the cost of each functional area bears to the combined
43 costs of the other functional areas.
44 8. The costs of each functional area which is to be jointly
45 funded, including the administrative and support costs allocated in
-
*SB451*

– 4 –
1 accordance with subsection 6, must be apportioned among the
2 participating political subdivisions as follows:
3 (a) The cost of uniformed functions in the field must be
4 apportioned on a percentage basis according to the comparative
5 cumulative, unweighted percentage relationship among the
6 participating political subdivisions of the permanent population of
7 the participating political subdivisions, as determined annually by
8 the Governor, the total number of calls for service which were
9 dispatched by the department in each participating political
10 subdivision, excluding:
11 (1) Calls for service with respect to felony crimes;
12 (2) Calls for service originating in those areas which were
13 served by a rural program of resident officers; and
14 (3) Calls for service originating from a program of contract
15 services which is totally funded by the contracting agency or entity,
16  and the total number of felonies which were reported in each
17 participating political subdivision, excluding reports of felonies
18 originating from a rural program of resident officers or a program of
19 contract services. The number of calls for service and the number of
20 felonies reported must have been made during the 12 months
21 preceding January 1 of the current fiscal year.
22 (b) The cost of the investigative function must be apportioned
23 on a percentage basis according to the comparative cumulative,
24 unweighted percentage relationship among the participating political
25 subdivisions of the total number of felonies which were reported in
26 each participating political subdivision during the 12 months
27 preceding January 1 of the current fiscal year.
28 9. For the purpose of subsection 8, the population attributable
29 to a county does not include the population of the cities within that
30 county or the population of those areas within that county which are
31 served by a rural program of resident officers.
32 10. The department shall maintain all of the statistics necessary
33 to effectuate the funding apportionment plan and shall maintain
34 accurate records in support of the determination required in order to
35 comply with this section.
36 11. If, in the initial year of the merger, the statistics necessary
37 to determine the funding apportionment plan for the remainder of
38 that year are incomplete, the department shall prepare a funding
39 apportionment plan for the remainder of that year based upon the
40 most accurate statistics available, and apply it as closely as possible
41 in the manner prescribed in this section. The fact that a budget, a
42 funding apportionment plan and a rural program of resident officers
43 are not prepared and submitted when due does not invalidate any of
44 them.

13 of a water project pursuant to NRS 349.950, or for the payment of
14 obligations under a capital lease executed before April 30, 1981,
15 must be calculated as follows:
16 (a) The rate must be set so that when applied to the current fiscal
17 year’s assessed valuation of all property which was on the preceding
18 fiscal year’s assessment roll, together with the assessed valuation of
19 property on the central assessment roll which was allocated to the
20 local government, but excluding any assessed valuation attributable
21 to the net proceeds of minerals, assessed valuation attributable to a
22 redevelopment area and assessed valuation of a fire protection
23 district attributable to real property which is transferred from private
24 ownership to public ownership for the purpose of conservation, it
25 will produce 106 percent of the maximum revenue allowable from
26 taxes ad valorem for the preceding fiscal year, except that the rate so
27 determined must not be less than the rate allowed for the previous
28 fiscal year, except for any decrease attributable to the imposition of
29 a tax pursuant to NRS 354.59813 in the previous year.
30 (b) This rate must then be applied to the total assessed valuation,
31 excluding the assessed valuation attributable to the net proceeds of
32 minerals and the assessed valuation of a fire protection district
33 attributable to real property which is transferred from private
34 ownership to public ownership for the purpose of conservation, but
35 including new real property, possessory interests and mobile homes,
36 for the current fiscal year to determine the allowed revenue from
37 taxes ad valorem for the local government.
