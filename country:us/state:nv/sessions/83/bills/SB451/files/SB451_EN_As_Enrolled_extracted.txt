Section 1:
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to taxation; extending the imposition of a property
tax rate in unincorporated areas of Clark County and the City
of Las Vegas for the purpose of employing police officers
with the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Under existing law, there is a property tax of 28 cents on each $100 of assessed
valuation imposed in a taxing district comprising the unincorporated areas of Clark
County and the City of Las Vegas for the purpose of employing peace officers with
the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department. This property tax is composed of:
(1) a rate of 8 cents on each $100 of assessed valuation in the taxing district, which
was approved by the voters of the taxing district at the 1988 General Election and
which is permanent; and (2) a rate of 20 cents on each $100 of assessed valuation in
the taxing district, which was approved by the voters of the taxing district at the
1996 General Election and which expires on June 30, 2027. (NRS 354.5982;
chapter 817, Statutes of Nevada 1987, at page 2284, as amended by chapter 585,
Statutes of Nevada 1997, at page 2865, chapter 658, Statutes of Nevada 1995, at
page 2534, as amended by chapter 585, Statutes of Nevada 1997, at page 2865)

Section 2:
Sections 1 and 4 of this bill provide for: (1) the continued imposition of the
property tax rate of 20 cents on each $100 of assessed valuation in the taxing
district, for the period beginning on July 1, 2027, and ending June 30, 2057; and (2)
the continued use of the proceeds of this property tax for the purpose of employing
police officers with the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department. Section 2 of
this bill makes a conforming change to ensure that the property tax rate continued
pursuant to this bill is apportioned to the unincorporated areas of Clark County and
the City of Las Vegas in the same manner as the existing property tax rate.
Existing law provides for a partial abatement of property taxes, which
has the effect of establishing an annual cap on increases of property taxes.
(NRS 361.4722-361.4724) However, under existing law, certain property tax rates
are exempt from this partial abatement, including, without limitation, a new or
increased property tax rate that a taxing entity is required to impose or increase by
any legislative act which becomes effective after April 6, 2005. Thus, with certain
exceptions, such property tax rates are not included in the calculation used to
determine the amount of property taxes abated under the existing law establishing
an annual cap on increases of property taxes. (NRS 361.4726) Because the property
tax rate of 20 cents on each $100 of assessed valuation, which was approved at the
1996 General Election for the purpose of employing police officers with the Las
Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, was imposed before April 6, 2005, section
1 also provides that the property tax rate extended by that section is not exempt
from the partial abatement of property taxes and, thus, is required to be included in
the calculation used to determine the amount of property taxes abated.

Section 3:
Section 3 of this bill makes a conforming change to continue the exemption of
the property tax rate extended by section 1 from provisions of existing law limiting
the amount of property tax revenue that may be received by certain local
governments.

to determine the funding apportionment plan for the remainder of
that year are incomplete, the department shall prepare a funding
apportionment plan for the remainder of that year based upon the
most accurate statistics available, and apply it as closely as possible
in the manner prescribed in this section. The fact that a budget, a
funding apportionment plan and a rural program of resident officers
are not prepared and submitted when due does not invalidate any of
them.

local government, but excluding any assessed valuation attributable
to the net proceeds of minerals, assessed valuation attributable to a
redevelopment area and assessed valuation of a fire protection
district attributable to real property which is transferred from private

determined must not be less than the rate allowed for the previous
fiscal year, except for any decrease attributable to the imposition of
a tax pursuant to NRS 354.59813 in the previous year.
(b) This rate must then be applied to the total assessed valuation,
excluding the assessed valuation attributable to the net proceeds of
minerals and the assessed valuation of a fire protection district
