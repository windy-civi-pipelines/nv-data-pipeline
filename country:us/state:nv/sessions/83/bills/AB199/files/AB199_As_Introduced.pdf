Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides that a person who maliciously, wantonly or negligently
2 discharges or causes to be discharged any pistol, gun or other kind of firearm under
3 certain circumstances is guilty of a misdemeanor. (NRS 202.280) Section 1 of this
4 bill removes the elements of maliciously and wantonly, thereby making the offense
5 apply only to negligently discharging or causing to be discharged any pistol, gun or
6 other kind of firearm under certain circumstances.
7 Existing law further provides that a person who willfully discharges any
8 firearm, air gun or other weapon, or throws any deadly missile in a public place or
9 in any place where any person might be endangered, although an injury does not
10 result, is guilty of a gross misdemeanor. (NRS 202.290) Section 2 of this bill
11 increases the penalty for willfully discharging a firearm in a public place within a
12 populated area designated as such for the purpose of prohibiting the discharge of
13 weapons or in any place where any person might be endangered, although an injury
14 does not result, making it: (1) a category C felony for a first offense; and (2) a
15 category B felony, punishable by imprisonment for a minimum term of not less
16 than 2 years and a maximum term of not more than 15 years, for a second or
17 subsequent offense, any offense involving discharging a firearm more than once in
18 a single occurrence or any offense where the person was previously convicted of an
19 offense involving the discharge of a firearm.
20 Existing law prohibits a child under the age of 18 years from handling or
21 possessing a firearm or having a firearm under his or her control and provides that a
22 child who violates such provisions commits a delinquent act for which the court is

23 authorized to detain the child in the same manner as if the child had committed an
24 act that would have been a felony if committed by an adult. (NRS 202.300)
25 Existing law provides that if a child is adjudicated delinquent because the child
26 handled or possessed a firearm or had a firearm under his or her control in violation
27 of that provision of existing law, the juvenile court is required to, for a first offense:
28 (1) order the child to perform 200 hours of community service; and (2) issue an
29 order suspending the driver’s license of the child for not more than 1 year or, if the
30 child does not possess a driver’s license, prohibit the child from receiving a driver’s
31 license for not more than 1 year. For a second offense, the juvenile court is required
32 to: (1) order the child to perform at least 200 hours but not more than 600 hours of
33 community service; and (2) issue an order suspending the driver’s license of the
34 child for at least 90 days but not more than 2 years, or if the child does not possess
35 a driver’s license, prohibit the child from receiving a driver’s license for at least 90
36 days and not more than 2 years. (NRS 62E.650) Section 3 of this bill: (1) revises
37 the punishments that the juvenile court is required to order such that the
38 punishments for a second offense are now applicable to a first offense; and (2)
39 authorizes the juvenile court, for a second offense, to commit the child for
40 confinement in a secure facility for the detention of children and impose any other
41 punitive measures that the court determines to be in the best interests of the public
42 or child.
