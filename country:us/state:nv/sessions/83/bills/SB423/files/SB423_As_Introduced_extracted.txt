Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates a health district in any county whose population is 700,000
2 or more (currently Clark County), which has jurisdiction over all public health
3 matters in the health district. (NRS 439.361, 439.362, 439.366) Existing law

5 whose population is less than 700,000 (currently all counties other than Clark
6 County), subject to the approval by the State Board of Health, by affirmative vote
7 of: (1) the board of county commissioners of two or more counties; (2) the
8 governing bodies of two or more cities or towns within any county; or (3) the board

10 or cities, town or towns, in such a county. (NRS 439.370) Existing law requires
11 each county which is not within a health district to establish a county board of
12 health. (NRS 439.280, 439.362, 439.380)
13 Section 2 of this bill defines the term “health authority” for the purposes of this
14 bill to include county boards of health, health districts and federally recognized
15 Indian tribes which are located in whole or in part in this State.
16 Existing law requires each insurer to pay to the Department of Taxation a tax
17 upon net direct premiums and net direct considerations written at the rate of 3.5
18 percent. (NRS 680B.027) Section 3 of this bill creates the Account for Public
19 Health in the State General Fund and requires the Division of Public and
20 Behavioral Health of the Department of Health and Human Services to administer
21 the Account. Section 7 of this bill requires the State Treasurer to deposit: (1) the
22 first $30,000,000 of revenues collected from the tax on net direct premiums and net
23 direct considerations during each biennium in the Account; and (2) any revenues
24 collected from the tax during the biennium in excess of $30,000,000 in the State
25 General Fund. Section 3 requires the Division to use any money which is deposited
26 in the Account to: (1) protect and promote public health; and (2) make allocations
27 to health authorities in certain specified percentages of the total money deposited in
28 the Account during the biennium. Section 3 requires the Division to submit to the
29 State Board of Health a report regarding the use of money in the Account.

31 or before December 1 of each odd-numbered year, an estimate of the amount of
32 money in the Account which will be available for allocation to health authorities for

34 each even-numbered year, to submit to the Division a request for an allocation from
35 the Account, which must be accompanied by a proposal for the use of the allocation
36 that includes certain information. Section 4 requires the Division to make
37 allocations from the Account on or before April 1 of each even-numbered year to
38 health authorities whose requests are approved and provides that money which is
39 not expended or committed for expenditure by the health authority before June 30
40 of an odd-numbered year reverts to the Account. Section 4 requires a health
41 authority that receives an allocation from the Account to submit a report to the
42 Division concerning the use of the allocated money.
43 Existing law authorizes a district board of health within a health district to
44 exercise the powers, duties and authority of a county board of health within the
45 health district and establishes the membership of a district board of health. (NRS
46 439.362, 439.366, 439.380, 439.390) Sections 5 and 6 of this bill revise the
47 membership of a district board of health in counties whose population is 700,000 or

57 governmental entities, health care providers and certain entities involved in the
58 business of health insurance to maintain, transmit and exchange health information
59 in accordance with that framework and certain other provisions of law governing
60 electronic health records. (NRS 439.539) Section 8 of this bill requires each health
61 authority that receives an allocation of money from the Account in 2026 to: (1)
62 develop a framework to ensure compliance with those requirements and otherwise
63 promote interoperability with networks and technologies used by certain persons
-

AN ACT relating to public health; creating the Account for Public
Health; authorizing allocations from the Account to
certain entities who have jurisdiction over public health;
requiring the Division of Public and Behavioral Health of
the Department of Health and Human Services and
entities which receive an allocation from the Account to

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates a health district in any county whose population is 700,000
2 or more (currently Clark County), which has jurisdiction over all public health
3 matters in the health district. (NRS 439.361, 439.362, 439.366) Existing law
4 authorizes the creation of a health district with similar jurisdiction in counties
5 whose population is less than 700,000 (currently all counties other than Clark
6 County), subject to the approval by the State Board of Health, by affirmative vote
7 of: (1) the board of county commissioners of two or more counties; (2) the
8 governing bodies of two or more cities or towns within any county; or (3) the board
-
*SB423*

– 2 –
9 of county commissioners and the governing body or bodies of any incorporated city
10 or cities, town or towns, in such a county. (NRS 439.370) Existing law requires
11 each county which is not within a health district to establish a county board of
12 health. (NRS 439.280, 439.362, 439.380)
13 Section 2 of this bill defines the term “health authority” for the purposes of this
14 bill to include county boards of health, health districts and federally recognized
15 Indian tribes which are located in whole or in part in this State.
16 Existing law requires each insurer to pay to the Department of Taxation a tax
17 upon net direct premiums and net direct considerations written at the rate of 3.5
18 percent. (NRS 680B.027) Section 3 of this bill creates the Account for Public
19 Health in the State General Fund and requires the Division of Public and
20 Behavioral Health of the Department of Health and Human Services to administer
21 the Account. Section 7 of this bill requires the State Treasurer to deposit: (1) the
22 first $30,000,000 of revenues collected from the tax on net direct premiums and net
23 direct considerations during each biennium in the Account; and (2) any revenues
24 collected from the tax during the biennium in excess of $30,000,000 in the State
25 General Fund. Section 3 requires the Division to use any money which is deposited
26 in the Account to: (1) protect and promote public health; and (2) make allocations
27 to health authorities in certain specified percentages of the total money deposited in
28 the Account during the biennium. Section 3 requires the Division to submit to the
29 State Board of Health a report regarding the use of money in the Account.
30 Section 4 of this bill requires the Division to publish on its Internet website, on
31 or before December 1 of each odd-numbered year, an estimate of the amount of
32 money in the Account which will be available for allocation to health authorities for
33 the biennium. Section 4 authorizes a health authority, on or before January 1 of
34 each even-numbered year, to submit to the Division a request for an allocation from
35 the Account, which must be accompanied by a proposal for the use of the allocation
36 that includes certain information. Section 4 requires the Division to make
37 allocations from the Account on or before April 1 of each even-numbered year to
38 health authorities whose requests are approved and provides that money which is
39 not expended or committed for expenditure by the health authority before June 30
40 of an odd-numbered year reverts to the Account. Section 4 requires a health
41 authority that receives an allocation from the Account to submit a report to the
42 Division concerning the use of the allocated money.
43 Existing law authorizes a district board of health within a health district to
44 exercise the powers, duties and authority of a county board of health within the
45 health district and establishes the membership of a district board of health. (NRS
46 439.362, 439.366, 439.380, 439.390) Sections 5 and 6 of this bill revise the
47 membership of a district board of health in counties whose population is 700,000 or
48 more (currently Clark County) and counties whose population is less than 700,000
49 (currently all counties other than Clark County) to add a member selected by the
50 Speaker of the Assembly and a member selected by the Majority Leader of the
51 Senate.
52 Existing law requires: (1) the Director of the Department to adopt regulations to
53 prescribe a framework for the electronic maintenance, transmittal and exchange of
54 electronic health records, prescriptions, health-related information and electronic
55 signatures and requirements for electronic equivalents of written entries or written
56 approvals; and (2) the Department and the divisions thereof, other state and local
57 governmental entities, health care providers and certain entities involved in the
58 business of health insurance to maintain, transmit and exchange health information
59 in accordance with that framework and certain other provisions of law governing
60 electronic health records. (NRS 439.539) Section 8 of this bill requires each health
61 authority that receives an allocation of money from the Account in 2026 to: (1)
62 develop a framework to ensure compliance with those requirements and otherwise
63 promote interoperability with networks and technologies used by certain persons
-
*SB423*

– 3 –
64 and entities involved in the provision of health care; and (2) submit the framework
65 to the Division and the Legislature. Section 8 requires a health authority to use that
66 allocation of money from the Account to pay the costs associated with developing
67 the framework.
