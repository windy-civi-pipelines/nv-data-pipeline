AN ACT relating to public health; creating the Account for Public
Health; authorizing allocations from the Account to
certain entities who have jurisdiction over public health;
requiring the Division of Public and Behavioral Health of
the Department of Health and Human Services and
entities which receive an allocation from the Account to
prepare reports concerning the use of money in the
Account; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates a health district in any county whose population is 700,000
2 or more (currently Clark County), which has jurisdiction over all public health
3 matters in the health district. (NRS 439.361, 439.362, 439.366) Existing law
4 authorizes the creation of a health district with similar jurisdiction in counties
5 whose population is less than 700,000 (currently all counties other than Clark
6 County), subject to the approval by the State Board of Health, by affirmative vote
7 of: (1) the board of county commissioners of two or more counties; (2) the
8 governing bodies of two or more cities or towns within any county; or (3) the board
9 of county commissioners and the governing body or bodies of any incorporated city
10 or cities, town or towns, in such a county. (NRS 439.370)
11 Senate Bill No. 312 of this session proposes to create: (1) the Tribal Health
12 Advisory Council; and (2) the Account for Tribal Health to fund the activities of
13 the Council. Sections 2 and 2.5 of this bill define the term “health authority” for
14 the purposes of this bill to include health districts which are formed by one or more
-

– 2 –
15 counties and, if Senate Bill No. 312 of this session is not enacted, federally
16 recognized Indian tribes which are located in whole or in part in this State.
17 Existing law requires each insurer to pay to the Department of Taxation a tax
18 upon net direct premiums and net direct considerations written at the rate of 3.5
19 percent. (NRS 680B.027) Sections 3 and 3.5 of this bill create the Account for
20 Public Health in the State General Fund and require the Division of Public and
21 Behavioral Health of the Department of Health and Human Services to administer
22 the Account. Section 7 of this bill requires the State Treasurer to deposit: (1) the
23 first $4,925,000 of revenues collected from the tax on net direct premiums and net
24 direct considerations during each biennium in the Account; and (2) any revenues
25 collected from the tax during the biennium in excess of $4,925,000 in the State
26 General Fund. Sections 3 and 3.5 require the Division to use any money which is
27 deposited in the Account to: (1) protect and promote public health; (2) make
28 allocations to health authorities in certain specified amounts from the money
29 deposited in the Account during the biennium; and (3) if Senate Bill No. 312 of this
30 session is enacted, allocate a specified amount of the money deposited in the
31 Account during the biennium to the Account for Tribal Health created by that bill.
32 Sections 3 and 3.5 require the Division to submit to the State Board of Health a
33 report regarding the use of money in the Account.
34 Section 4 of this bill requires the Division to publish on its Internet website, on
35 or before December 1 of each odd-numbered year, an estimate of the amount of
36 money in the Account which will be available for allocation to health authorities for
37 the biennium. Section 4 authorizes a health authority, on or before January 1 of
38 each even-numbered year, to submit to the Division a request for an allocation from
39 the Account, which must be accompanied by a proposal for the use of the allocation
40 that includes certain information. Section 4 requires the Division to make
41 allocations from the Account on or before April 1 of each even-numbered year to
42 health authorities whose requests are approved and provides that money which is
43 not expended or committed for expenditure by the health authority before June 30
44 of an odd-numbered year reverts to the Account. Section 4 requires a health
45 authority that receives an allocation from the Account to submit a report to the
46 Division concerning the use of the allocated money.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

SUMMARY—Revises provisions governing public health.
(BDR 40-349)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public health; creating the Account for Public
Health; authorizing allocations from the Account to
certain entities who have jurisdiction over public health;
requiring the Division of Public and Behavioral Health of
the Department of Health and Human Services and
entities which receive an allocation from the Account to
prepare reports concerning the use of money in the
Account; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates a health district in any county whose population is 700,000
2 or more (currently Clark County), which has jurisdiction over all public health
3 matters in the health district. (NRS 439.361, 439.362, 439.366) Existing law
4 authorizes the creation of a health district with similar jurisdiction in counties
5 whose population is less than 700,000 (currently all counties other than Clark
6 County), subject to the approval by the State Board of Health, by affirmative vote
7 of: (1) the board of county commissioners of two or more counties; (2) the
8 governing bodies of two or more cities or towns within any county; or (3) the board
9 of county commissioners and the governing body or bodies of any incorporated city
10 or cities, town or towns, in such a county. (NRS 439.370)
11 Senate Bill No. 312 of this session proposes to create: (1) the Tribal Health
12 Advisory Council; and (2) the Account for Tribal Health to fund the activities of
13 the Council. Sections 2 and 2.5 of this bill define the term “health authority” for
14 the purposes of this bill to include health districts which are formed by one or more
-
*SB423_R1*

– 2 –
15 counties and, if Senate Bill No. 312 of this session is not enacted, federally
16 recognized Indian tribes which are located in whole or in part in this State.
17 Existing law requires each insurer to pay to the Department of Taxation a tax
18 upon net direct premiums and net direct considerations written at the rate of 3.5
19 percent. (NRS 680B.027) Sections 3 and 3.5 of this bill create the Account for
20 Public Health in the State General Fund and require the Division of Public and
21 Behavioral Health of the Department of Health and Human Services to administer
22 the Account. Section 7 of this bill requires the State Treasurer to deposit: (1) the
23 first $4,925,000 of revenues collected from the tax on net direct premiums and net
24 direct considerations during each biennium in the Account; and (2) any revenues
25 collected from the tax during the biennium in excess of $4,925,000 in the State
26 General Fund. Sections 3 and 3.5 require the Division to use any money which is
27 deposited in the Account to: (1) protect and promote public health; (2) make
