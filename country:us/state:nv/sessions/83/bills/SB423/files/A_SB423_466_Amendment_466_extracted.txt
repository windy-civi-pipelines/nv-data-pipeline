17 Existing law requires each insurer to pay to the Department of Taxation a tax upon net

49 if any, payable, the insurer is entitled to pay under protest the tax in the amount
50 assessed by the Department of Taxation, without waiving or otherwise affecting
51 any right of the insurer to recover any amount determined, through appropriate
52 legal action taken by the insurer against the Department of Taxation, to have been
53 in excess of the amount of tax lawfully payable.

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates a health district in any county whose population is 700,000 or more
2 (currently Clark County), which has jurisdiction over all public health matters in the health
3 district. (NRS 439.361, 439.362, 439.366) Existing law authorizes the creation of a health
4 district with similar jurisdiction in counties whose population is less than 700,000 (currently
5 all counties other than Clark County), subject to the approval by the State Board of Health, by
6 affirmative vote of: (1) the board of county commissioners of two or more counties; (2) the
7 governing bodies of two or more cities or towns within any county; or (3) the board of county
8 commissioners and the governing body or bodies of any incorporated city or cities, town or
9 towns, in such a county. (NRS 439.370) [Existing law requires each county which is not
10 within a health district to establish a county board of health. (NRS 439.280, 439.362, 439.380)
11 Section] Senate Bill No. 312 of this session proposes to create: (1) the Tribal Health
12 Advisory Council; and (2) the Account for Tribal Health to fund the activities of the

Senate Amendment No. 466 to Senate Bill No. 423 Page 4
15 by one or more counties and , if Senate Bill No. 312 of this session is not enacted, federally
16 recognized Indian tribes which are located in whole or in part in this State.
17 Existing law requires each insurer to pay to the Department of Taxation a tax upon net
18 direct premiums and net direct considerations written at the rate of 3.5 percent. (NRS
19 680B.027) [Section] Sections 3 and 3.5 of this bill [creates] create the Account for Public
20 Health in the State General Fund and [requires] require the Division of Public and Behavioral
21 Health of the Department of Health and Human Services to administer the Account. Section 7
22 of this bill requires the State Treasurer to deposit: (1) the first [$30,000,000] $4,925,000 of
23 revenues collected from the tax on net direct premiums and net direct considerations during
24 each biennium in the Account; and (2) any revenues collected from the tax during the
25 biennium in excess of [$30,000,000] $4,925,000 in the State General Fund. [Section] Sections
26 3 [requires] and 3.5 require the Division to use any money which is deposited in the Account
27 to: (1) protect and promote public health; [and] (2) make allocations to health authorities in
28 certain specified [percentages of] amounts from the [total] money deposited in the Account
29 during the biennium [. Section] ; and (3) if Senate Bill No. 312 of this session is enacted,
30 allocate a specified amount of the money deposited in the Account during the biennium
31 to the Account for Tribal Health created by that bill. Sections 3 [requires] and 3.5 require
32 the Division to submit to the State Board of Health a report regarding the use of money in the
33 Account.
34 Section 4 of this bill requires the Division to publish on its Internet website, on or before
35 December 1 of each odd-numbered year, an estimate of the amount of money in the Account
36 which will be available for allocation to health authorities for the biennium. Section 4
37 authorizes a health authority, on or before January 1 of each even-numbered year, to submit to
38 the Division a request for an allocation from the Account, which must be accompanied by a
39 proposal for the use of the allocation that includes certain information. Section 4 requires the
40 Division to make allocations from the Account on or before April 1 of each even-numbered
41 year to health authorities whose requests are approved and provides that money which is not
42 expended or committed for expenditure by the health authority before June 30 of an odd-
43 numbered year reverts to the Account. Section 4 requires a health authority that receives an
44 allocation from the Account to submit a report to the Division concerning the use of the
45 allocated money.
46 [Existing law authorizes a district board of health within a health district to exercise the
47 powers, duties and authority of a county board of health within the health district and
48 establishes the membership of a district board of health. (NRS 439.362, 439.366, 439.380,
49 439.390) Sections 5 and 6 of this bill revise the membership of a district board of health in
50 counties whose population is 700,000 or more (currently Clark County) and counties whose
51 population is less than 700,000 (currently all counties other than Clark County) to add a
52 member selected by the Speaker of the Assembly and a member selected by the Majority
53 Leader of the Senate.
54 Existing law requires: (1) the Director of the Department to adopt regulations to prescribe
55 a framework for the electronic maintenance, transmittal and exchange of electronic health
56 records, prescriptions, health-related information and electronic signatures and requirements
57 for electronic equivalents of written entries or written approvals; and (2) the Department and
58 the divisions thereof, other state and local governmental entities, health care providers and
59 certain entities involved in the business of health insurance to maintain, transmit and exchange
60 health information in accordance with that framework and certain other provisions of law
61 governing electronic health records. (NRS 439.539) Section 8 of this bill requires each health
62 authority that receives an allocation of money from the Account in 2026 to: (1) develop a
63 framework to ensure compliance with those requirements and otherwise promote
64 interoperability with networks and technologies used by certain persons and entities involved
65 in the provision of health care; and (2) submit the framework to the Division and the
66 Legislature. Section 8 requires a health authority to use that allocation of money from the
67 Account to pay the costs associated with developing the framework.]
