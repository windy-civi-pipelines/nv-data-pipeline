AN ACT relating to unemployment compensation; revising
requirements for obtaining judicial review of a decision of
the Board of Review concerning a claim for
unemployment benefits; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes any party aggrieved by a decision of the Board of
2 Review concerning a claim for unemployment benefits to obtain judicial review of
3 the decision by commencing an action in the district court of the county where the
4 employment which is the basis of the claim was performed. Existing law requires,
5 within 45 days after the commencement of the action, a petition to be served upon
6 the Administrator of the Employment Security Division of the Department of
7 Employment, Training and Rehabilitation at a designated office of the
8 Administrator, unless the Administrator is the appellant, or upon such person as the
9 Administrator may designate. (NRS 612.530)
10 Section 1 of this bill sets forth additional requirements and procedures
11 concerning that petition. Section 1 specifies that service of the petition must
12 comply with the requirements of existing law and the applicable provisions of the
13 Nevada Rules of Civil Procedure for the service of a summons and complaint. If an
14 appellant, within 45 days after the commencement of the action, fails to serve any
15 petition upon the Administrator or his or her designee, including a petition that fails
16 to comply with the requirements for the petition and the service of the petition,
17 section 1 provides that the court is deprived of jurisdiction over the action and is
-
*AB12_R1*
– 2 –
18 required to dismiss the action upon the motion of the Administrator. If an appellant
19 does serve a petition upon the Administrator or his or her designee within the
20 required period, section 1 authorizes the Administrator to file a motion with the
21 court to dismiss the action on the basis that the petition did not comply or was
22 served in a manner that did not comply with the requirements for the petition.
23 Section 1 requires the appellant to cure all deficiencies concerning the petition, if
24 any, within 10 business days after the filing of the motion. Under section 1, the
25 failure of the appellant to do so deprives the court of jurisdiction over the action,
26 and the court is required to grant the motion to dismiss if the court determines that
27 the petition was deficient and those deficiencies were not cured within the required
28 period.
29 Section 2 of this bill provides that the amendatory provisions of this bill apply
30 to a petition for judicial review that is filed on or after the effective date of this bill.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 612.530 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 612.530 1. Within 11 days after the decision of the Board of
3 Review has become final, any party aggrieved thereby or the
4 Administrator may secure judicial review thereof by commencing
5 an action in the district court of the county where the employment
6 which is the basis of the claim was performed for the review of the
7 decision, in which action any other party to the proceedings before
8 the Board of Review must be made a defendant.
9 2. In such action, a petition which need not be verified, but
10 which must state the grounds upon which a review is sought, must,
11 within 45 days after the commencement of the action, be served
12 upon the Administrator at a designated office of the Administrator
13 in Carson City, unless the Administrator is the appellant, or upon
14 such person as the Administrator may designate, and such service
15 shall be deemed completed service on all parties, but there must be
16 left with the party so served as many copies of the petition as there
17 are defendants, and the Administrator shall forthwith mail one such
18 copy to each defendant. Service of a petition pursuant to this
19 subsection must comply with the provisions of this subsection and
20 the applicable provisions of the Nevada Rules of Civil Procedure
21 for the service of a summons and complaint.
22 3. [The] If the appellant fails to serve upon the Administrator,
23 or upon such person as the Administrator may designate, any
24 petition pursuant to subsection 2, including, without limitation, a
25 petition that does not comply or is served in a manner that does
26 not comply with the requirements of subsection 2, within 45 days
27 after the commencement of the action, the court is deprived of
28 jurisdiction over the action and shall dismiss the action upon the
29 motion of the Administrator.
-
*AB12_R1*
– 3 –
1 4. If the appellant serves upon the Administrator, or upon
2 such person as the Administrator may designate, a petition
3 pursuant to subsection 2 within 45 days after the commencement
4 of the action, the Administrator may, within 45 days after the
5 receipt of the petition, file a motion with the court to dismiss the
6 action on the basis that the petition did not comply or was served
7 in a manner that did not comply with the requirements of
8 subsection 2. Within 10 business days after the filing of the motion
9 to dismiss, the appellant shall cure each deficiency concerning the
10 petition, if any. The requirement to cure any deficiency
11 concerning the petition within 10 business days after the filing of
12 the motion to dismiss must be strictly complied with and may not
13 be excused by the court. Failure to comply with that requirement
14 deprives the court of jurisdiction over the action and, if the court
15 determines that the petition did not comply or was served in a
16 manner that did not comply with the requirements of subsection 2
17 and the deficiencies concerning the petition were not cured within
18 10 business days after the filing of the motion to dismiss, the court
19 shall grant the motion to dismiss.
20 5. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the
21 Administrator shall file with the court an answer within 45 days
22 after being served with a petition pursuant to subsection 2 [or, if]
23 unless the Administrator filed with the court a motion to dismiss
24 pursuant to subsection 4 and the motion was denied, in which case
25 the Administrator shall file the answer within 45 days after the
26 date on which the motion was denied. If the Administrator is the
27 appellant, the Administrator shall serve the petition upon each other
28 party within 45 days after commencement of the action. With the
29 Administrator’s answer or petition, the Administrator shall certify
30 and file with the court originals or true copies of all documents and
31 papers and a transcript of all testimony taken in the matter, together
32 with the Board of Review’s findings of fact and decision therein.
33 The Administrator may certify to the court questions of law
34 involved in any decision.
35 [4.] 6. In any judicial proceedings under this section, the
36 finding of the Board of Review as to the facts, if supported by
37 evidence and in the absence of fraud, is conclusive, and the
38 jurisdiction of the court is confined to questions of law.
39 [5.] 7. Such actions, and the questions so certified, must be
40 heard in a summary manner and must be given precedence over all
41 other civil cases except cases arising under chapters 616A to 616D,
42 inclusive, or chapter 617 of NRS.
43 [6.] 8. An appeal may be taken from the decision of the district
44 court to the appellate court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to the
45 rules fixed by the Supreme Court of Nevada pursuant to Section 4 of
-
*AB12_R1*
– 4 –
1 Article 6 of the Nevada Constitution in the same manner, but not
2 inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter, as is provided in
3 civil cases.
4 [7.] 9. It is not necessary, in any judicial proceeding under this
5 section, to enter exceptions to the rulings of the Board of Review,
6 and no bond may be required for entering the appeal.
7 [8.] 10. Upon the final determination of the judicial
8 proceeding, the Board of Review shall enter an order in accordance
9 with the determination.
10 [9.] 11. A petition for judicial review does not act as a
11 supersedeas or stay unless the Board of Review so orders.
12 Sec. 2. The amendatory provisions of this act apply to a
13 petition for judicial review that is filed on or after the effective date
14 of this act.
15 Sec. 3. This act becomes effective upon passage and approval.
