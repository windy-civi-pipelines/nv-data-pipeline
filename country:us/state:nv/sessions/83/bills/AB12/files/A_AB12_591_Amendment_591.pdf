EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to unemployment compensation; revising requirements for
obtaining judicial review of a decision of the Board of Review
concerning a claim for unemployment benefits; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes any party aggrieved by a decision of the Board of Review
2 concerning a claim for unemployment benefits to obtain judicial review of the decision by
3 commencing an action in the district court of the county where the employment which is the
4 basis of the claim was performed. Existing law requires, within 45 days after the
5 commencement of the action, a petition to be served upon the Administrator of the
6 Employment Security Division of the Department of Employment, Training and
7 Rehabilitation at a designated office of the Administrator, unless the Administrator is the
8 appellant, or upon such person as the Administrator may designate. (NRS 612.530)
9 [The Nevada Supreme Court has determined that the requirement that a petition be served
10 within 45 days after the commencement of the action is mandatory and requires strict
11 enforcement. (Nokley v. Empl’t Sec. Div., No. 85045, 2023 WL 3441031, at **1 (Nev. May
12 12, 2023)) Section 1 of this bill codifies that determination into statute by specifically
13 requiring strict compliance with that requirement and prohibiting its excusal by the court.
14 Additionally, the Nevada Supreme Court has declined to address whether the requirement that
15 a petition must be served within 45 days after the commencement of the action is a
16 jurisdictional requirement. (Id.) Section 1 specifies that the requirement is jurisdictional by
17 providing that the failure to comply with that requirement] Section 1 of this bill sets forth
18 additional requirements and procedures concerning that petition. Section 1 specifies that
19 service of the petition must comply with the requirements of existing law and the
20 applicable provisions of the Nevada Rules of Civil Procedure for the service of a
21 summons and complaint. If an appellant, within 45 days after the commencement of the
22 action, fails to serve any petition upon the Administrator or his or her designee,

Senate Amendment No. 591 to Assembly Bill No. 12 Page 4
23 including a petition that fails to comply with the requirements for the petition and the
24 service of the petition, section 1 provides that the court is deprived of jurisdiction over
25 the action and is required to dismiss the action upon the motion of the Administrator. If
26 an appellant does serve a petition upon the Administrator or his or her designee within
27 the required period, section 1 authorizes the Administrator to file a motion with the
28 court to dismiss the action on the basis that the petition did not comply or was served in
29 a manner that did not comply with the requirements for the petition. Section 1 requires
30 the appellant to cure all deficiencies concerning the petition, if any, within 10 business
31 days after the filing of the motion. Under section 1, the failure of the appellant to do so
32 deprives the court of jurisdiction over the action [.] , and the court is required to grant the
33 motion to dismiss if the court determines that the petition was deficient and those
34 deficiencies were not cured within the required period.
35 Section 2 of this bill [clarifies] provides that the amendatory provisions of this bill apply
36 to a petition for judicial review that is filed on or after the effective date of this bill.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 612.530 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 612.530 1. Within 11 days after the decision of the Board of Review has
3 become final, any party aggrieved thereby or the Administrator may secure judicial
4 review thereof by commencing an action in the district court of the county where
5 the employment which is the basis of the claim was performed for the review of the
6 decision, in which action any other party to the proceedings before the Board of
7 Review must be made a defendant.
8 2. In such action, a petition which need not be verified, but which must state
9 the grounds upon which a review is sought, must, within 45 days after the
10 commencement of the action, be served upon the Administrator at a designated
11 office of the Administrator in Carson City, unless the Administrator is the
12 appellant, or upon such person as the Administrator may designate, and such
13 service shall be deemed completed service on all parties, but there must be left with
14 the party so served as many copies of the petition as there are defendants, and the
15 Administrator shall forthwith mail one such copy to each defendant. Service of a
16 petition pursuant to this subsection must comply with the provisions of this
17 subsection and the applicable provisions of the Nevada Rules of Civil Procedure
18 for the service of a summons and complaint.
19 3. [The requirement set forth in subsection 2 that a petition must be served]
20 If the appellant fails to serve upon the Administrator, or upon such person as the
21 Administrator may designate, any petition pursuant to subsection 2, including,
22 without limitation, a petition that does not comply or is served in a manner that
23 does not comply with the requirements of subsection 2, within 45 days after the
24 commencement of the action , the court is deprived of jurisdiction over the action
25 and shall dismiss the action upon the motion of the Administrator.
26 4. If the appellant serves upon the Administrator, or upon such person as
27 the Administrator may designate, a petition pursuant to subsection 2 within 45
28 days after the commencement of the action, the Administrator may, within 45
29 days after the receipt of the petition, file a motion with the court to dismiss the
30 action on the basis that the petition did not comply or was served in a manner
31 that did not comply with the requirements of subsection 2. Within 10 business
32 days after the filing of the motion to dismiss, the appellant shall cure each
33 deficiency concerning the petition, if any. The requirement to cure any deficiency
34 concerning the petition within 10 business days after the filing of the motion to
35 dismiss must be strictly complied with and may not be excused by the court.

Senate Amendment No. 591 to Assembly Bill No. 12 Page 5
1 Failure to comply with that requirement deprives the court of jurisdiction over
2 the action [.] and, if the court determines that the petition did not comply or was
3 served in a manner that did not comply with the requirements of subsection 2 and
4 the deficiencies concerning the petition were not cured within 10 business days
5 after the filing of the motion to dismiss, the court shall grant the motion to
6 dismiss.
7 [4. The]
8 5. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the Administrator shall
9 file with the court an answer within 45 days after being served with a petition
10 pursuant to subsection 2 [or, if] unless the Administrator filed with the court a
11 motion to dismiss pursuant to subsection 4 and the motion was denied, in which
12 case the Administrator shall file the answer within 45 days after the date on
13 which the motion was denied. If the Administrator is the appellant, the
14 Administrator shall serve the petition upon each other party within 45 days after
15 commencement of the action. With the Administrator’s answer or petition, the
16 Administrator shall certify and file with the court originals or true copies of all
17 documents and papers and a transcript of all testimony taken in the matter, together
18 with the Board of Review’s findings of fact and decision therein. The Administrator
19 may certify to the court questions of law involved in any decision.
20 [4. 5.] 6. In any judicial proceedings under this section, the finding of the
21 Board of Review as to the facts, if supported by evidence and in the absence of
22 fraud, is conclusive, and the jurisdiction of the court is confined to questions of law.
23 [5. 6.] 7. Such actions, and the questions so certified, must be heard in a
24 summary manner and must be given precedence over all other civil cases except
25 cases arising under chapters 616A to 616D, inclusive, or chapter 617 of NRS.
26 [6. 7.] 8. An appeal may be taken from the decision of the district court to
27 the appellate court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to the rules fixed by the
28 Supreme Court of Nevada pursuant to Section 4 of Article 6 of the Nevada
29 Constitution in the same manner, but not inconsistent with the provisions of this
30 chapter, as is provided in civil cases.
31 [7. 8.] 9. It is not necessary, in any judicial proceeding under this section, to
32 enter exceptions to the rulings of the Board of Review, and no bond may be
33 required for entering the appeal.
34 [8. 9.] 10. Upon the final determination of the judicial proceeding, the Board
35 of Review shall enter an order in accordance with the determination.
36 [9. 10.] 11. A petition for judicial review does not act as a supersedeas or
37 stay unless the Board of Review so orders.
38 Sec. 2. The amendatory provisions of this act apply to a petition for judicial
39 review that is filed on or after the effective date of this act.
40 Sec. 3. This act becomes effective upon passage and approval.
