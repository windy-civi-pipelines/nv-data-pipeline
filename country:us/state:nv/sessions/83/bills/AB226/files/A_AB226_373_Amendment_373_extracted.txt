4 approving an application for such credits or abatements unless the applicant satisfies certain

6 abatement. (NRS 231.1555, 274.310, 274.320, 274.330, 360.750, 360.753, 360.754, 360.759,

15 this bill: (1) authorize the Office to investigate whether the recipient of an abatement or partial
16 abatement is complying with the terms of the community benefits plan; and (2) require a
17 recipient to repay the amount of the abatement or partial abatement, plus interest, if the
18 Executive Director of the Office determines that the recipient has not substantially complied
19 with the terms of the community benefits plan. Sections 10 and 11 of this bill make
