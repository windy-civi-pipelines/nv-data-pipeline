Assembly Bill No. 226–Assemblymember Mosca
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to taxation; requiring an application for certain
transferable tax credits and certain tax abatements to contain
a certification that the applicant agrees to submit a
community benefits agreement and collaborate with the
community in which the business is located if the application
is approved; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law authorizes the Office of Economic Development to approve
transferable tax credits and abatements or partial abatements of certain property
taxes, business taxes and sales and use taxes for certain businesses in certain
circumstances. The Office is prohibited from approving an application for such
credits or abatements unless the applicant satisfies certain criteria and has entered
into an agreement with the Office establishing certain terms for the abatement.
(NRS 231.1555, 274.310, 274.320, 274.330, 360.750, 360.753, 360.754, 360.759,
360.889, 360.945) Sections 1-3, 6, 8 and 12-15 of this bill additionally require an
applicant for certain transferable tax credits or a tax abatement to certify in the
application for transferrable tax credits or a tax abatement, as applicable, that, if the
application is approved, the business will: (1) collaborate with the community in
which the business is located; and (2) submit to the Office a community benefits
agreement not later than 2 years after the date on which the application is approved.
Section 16 of this bill makes the requirements of this bill relating to the
certification requirement applicable only to applications for certain transferable tax
credits or certain abatements submitted on or after July 1, 2025.
