AN ACT relating to taxation; requiring applicants for certain
transferable tax credits and certain tax abatements to
agree to community benefits plan prescribing the
requirements for a community benefits plan; authorizing
the Office of Economic Development to investigate the
recipient of certain transferable tax credits and certain tax
abatements for compliance with a community benefits
plan; requiring the recipient of certain transferable tax
credits and certain tax abatements to repay the amount of
the credits and abatements if the recipient is not in
substantial compliance with the community benefits plan;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the Office of Economic Development to approve
2 transferable tax credits and abatements or partial abatements of certain property
3 taxes, business taxes and sales and use taxes for certain businesses in certain
4 circumstances. The Office is prohibited from approving an application for such
5 credits or abatements unless the applicant satisfies certain criteria and has entered
6 into an agreement with the Office establishing certain terms for the abatement.
7 (NRS 231.1555, 274.310, 274.320, 274.330, 360.750, 360.753, 360.754, 360.759,
8 360.889, 360.945) Sections 1-4, 6, 8 and 12-15 of this bill require such an
9 agreement between the Office and an applicant for transferable tax credits or a tax
10 abatement to incorporate a community benefits plan addressing actions that the
11 applicant agrees to take to benefit the vitality of the local community and improve
12 the social and economic well-being of members of the local community. Sections
13 1-3, 5, 7, 9 and 12-15 of this bill: (1) authorize the Office to investigate whether
14 the recipient of an abatement or partial abatement is complying with the terms of
15 the community benefits plan; and (2) require a recipient to repay the amount of the
16 abatement or partial abatement, plus interest, if the Executive Director of the Office
-

– 2 –
17 determines that the recipient has not substantially complied with the terms of the
18 community benefits plan. Sections 10 and 11 of this bill make conforming changes
19 to update references to provisions renumbered by section 2. Section 16 of this bill
20 makes the requirements of this relating to community benefits plans only if an
21 applicant for certain transferable tax credits or certain abatements submits an
22 application on or after July 1, 2025.

ASSEMBLY BILL NO. 226–ASSEMBLYMEMBER MOSCA
PREFILED FEBRUARY 3, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Revenue
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to economic
development. (BDR 32-690)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to taxation; requiring applicants for certain
transferable tax credits and certain tax abatements to
agree to community benefits plan prescribing the
requirements for a community benefits plan; authorizing
the Office of Economic Development to investigate the
recipient of certain transferable tax credits and certain tax
abatements for compliance with a community benefits
plan; requiring the recipient of certain transferable tax
credits and certain tax abatements to repay the amount of
the credits and abatements if the recipient is not in
substantial compliance with the community benefits plan;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the Office of Economic Development to approve
2 transferable tax credits and abatements or partial abatements of certain property
3 taxes, business taxes and sales and use taxes for certain businesses in certain
4 circumstances. The Office is prohibited from approving an application for such
5 credits or abatements unless the applicant satisfies certain criteria and has entered
6 into an agreement with the Office establishing certain terms for the abatement.
7 (NRS 231.1555, 274.310, 274.320, 274.330, 360.750, 360.753, 360.754, 360.759,
8 360.889, 360.945) Sections 1-4, 6, 8 and 12-15 of this bill require such an
9 agreement between the Office and an applicant for transferable tax credits or a tax
10 abatement to incorporate a community benefits plan addressing actions that the
11 applicant agrees to take to benefit the vitality of the local community and improve
12 the social and economic well-being of members of the local community. Sections
13 1-3, 5, 7, 9 and 12-15 of this bill: (1) authorize the Office to investigate whether
14 the recipient of an abatement or partial abatement is complying with the terms of
15 the community benefits plan; and (2) require a recipient to repay the amount of the
16 abatement or partial abatement, plus interest, if the Executive Director of the Office
-
*AB226*

– 2 –
17 determines that the recipient has not substantially complied with the terms of the
18 community benefits plan. Sections 10 and 11 of this bill make conforming changes
19 to update references to provisions renumbered by section 2. Section 16 of this bill
20 makes the requirements of this relating to community benefits plans only if an
21 applicant for certain transferable tax credits or certain abatements submits an
22 application on or after July 1, 2025.
