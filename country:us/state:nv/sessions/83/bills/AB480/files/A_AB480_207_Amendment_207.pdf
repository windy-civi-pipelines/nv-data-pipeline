EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to housing; revising provisions relating to discrimination in
housing; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing federal law prohibits certain discriminatory practices relating to housing based
2 on race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status or national origin. (42 U.S.C. §§ 3601 et
3 seq.) Under certain circumstances, existing federal regulations provide that housing
4 discrimination may be established based on the discriminatory effect of a practice, even if the
5 practice was not motivated by a discriminatory intent. (24 C.F.R. § 100.500) This is
6 commonly known as the “disparate impact standard.”
7 The Nevada Fair Housing Law: (1) prohibits discrimination in housing on the basis of
8 race, religious creed, color, national origin, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity or
9 expression, ancestry, familial status or sex; and (2) provides a process and remedies to enforce
10 the Nevada Fair Housing Law if a person engages in such discrimination, including the
11 authority to file a complaint with the Nevada Equal Rights Commission and to commence an
12 action in any district court to obtain an injunction and civil damages. (NRS 118.010-118.120)
13 This bill adopts the disparate impact standard for purposes of the Nevada Fair Housing Law.
14 Section 1 of this bill provides that liability may be established for a discriminatory
15 housing practice if: (1) the practice was motivated by a discriminatory intent; or (2) with
16 certain exceptions, the practice was not motivated by a discriminatory intent but the practice
17 actually or predictably results in a [disparate impact] discriminatory effect on a group of
18 persons or creates, increases, reinforces or perpetuates segregated housing patterns because of
19 race, religious creed, color, national origin, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity or
20 expression, ancestry, familial status or sex. Section 1 further provides that there is no liability
21 for a discriminatory housing practice based on the disparate impact standard if, based on
22 evidence that is not hypothetical or speculative: (1) the practice is necessary to achieve one or
23 more substantial, legitimate and nondiscriminatory interests of the respondent; and (2) the
24 interests of the respondent could not be served by another practice that has a less
25 discriminatory effect. Section 1 also provides that the complainant must establish that a

Assembly Amendment No. 207 to Assembly Bill No. 480 Page 4
26 challenged practice caused or predictably will cause a [disparate impact.] discriminatory
27 effect. If the claimant meets such burden of proof, the respondent has the burden of proving
28 that the challenged practice is necessary to achieve one or more substantial, legitimate and
29 nondiscriminatory interests of the respondent. If the respondent meets his or her burden of
30 proof, the complainant may still prevail upon proving that the substantial, legitimate and
31 nondiscriminatory interests supporting the challenged practice could be served by another
32 practice that has a less discriminatory effect.
33 Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to include section 1 in the Nevada Fair
34 Housing Law.
35 Section 3 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law relating to discrimination in
36 housing to the provisions of section 1.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 118 of NRS is hereby amended by adding thereto a new
2 section to read as follows:
3 1. Except as otherwise provided in this section, liability may be established
4 for a discriminatory housing practice if:
5 (a) The practice was motivated by a discriminatory intent; or
6 (b) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the practice was not
7 motivated by a discriminatory intent but the practice actually or predictably
8 results in a [disparate impact] discriminatory effect on a group of persons or
9 creates, increases, reinforces or perpetuates segregated housing patterns because
10 of race, religious creed, color, national origin, disability, sexual orientation,
11 gender identity or expression, ancestry, familial status or sex.
12 2. There is no liability for a discriminatory housing practice pursuant to
13 paragraph (b) of subsection 1 if, based on evidence that is not hypothetical or
14 speculative:
15 (a) The practice is necessary to achieve one or more substantial, legitimate
16 and nondiscriminatory interests of the respondent; and
17 (b) The interests of the respondent described in paragraph (a) could not be
18 served by another practice that has a less discriminatory effect.
19 3. For purposes of paragraph (b) of subsection 1, the complainant must
20 establish that a challenged practice caused or predictably will cause a [disparate
21 impact.] discriminatory effect. If the complainant meets such burden of proof, the
22 respondent has the burden of proving that the challenged practice is necessary to
23 achieve one or more substantial, legitimate and nondiscriminatory interests of the
24 respondent. If the respondent meets his or her burden of proof, the complainant
25 may still prevail upon proving that the substantial, legitimate and
26 nondiscriminatory interests supporting the challenged practice could be served by
27 another practice that has a less discriminatory effect.
28 4. As used in this section:
29 (a) “Complainant” means a person by whom, or on whose behalf:
30 (1) A complaint is filed with the Commission pursuant to NRS 118.110;
31 or
32 (2) An action is commenced pursuant to NRS 118.120.
33 (b) “Respondent” means a person against whom:
34 (1) A complaint is filed with the Commission pursuant to NRS 118.110;
35 or
