EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to housing; revising provisions relating to
discrimination in housing; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing federal law prohibits certain discriminatory practices relating to
2 housing based on race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status or national
3 origin. (42 U.S.C. §§ 3601 et seq.) Under certain circumstances, existing federal
4 regulations provide that housing discrimination may be established based on the
5 discriminatory effect of a practice, even if the practice was not motivated by a
6 discriminatory intent. (24 C.F.R. § 100.500) This is commonly known as the
7 “disparate impact standard.”
8 The Nevada Fair Housing Law: (1) prohibits discrimination in housing on the
9 basis of race, religious creed, color, national origin, disability, sexual orientation,
10 gender identity or expression, ancestry, familial status or sex; and (2) provides a
11 process and remedies to enforce the Nevada Fair Housing Law if a person engages
12 in such discrimination, including the authority to file a complaint with the Nevada
13 Equal Rights Commission and to commence an action in any district court to obtain
14 an injunction and civil damages. (NRS 118.010-118.120) This bill adopts the
15 disparate impact standard for purposes of the Nevada Fair Housing Law.
16 Section 1 of this bill provides that liability may be established for a
17 discriminatory housing practice if: (1) the practice was motivated by a
18 discriminatory intent; or (2) with certain exceptions, the practice was not motivated
19 by a discriminatory intent but the practice actually or predictably results in a
20 disparate impact on a group of persons or creates, increases, reinforces or

21 perpetuates segregated housing patterns because of race, religious creed, color,
22 national origin, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression,
23 ancestry, familial status or sex. Section 1 further provides that there is no liability
24 for a discriminatory housing practice based on the disparate impact standard if,
25 based on evidence that is not hypothetical or speculative: (1) the practice is
26 necessary to achieve one or more substantial, legitimate and nondiscriminatory
27 interests of the respondent; and (2) the interests of the respondent could not be
28 served by another practice that has a less discriminatory effect. Section 1 also
29 provides that the complainant must establish that a challenged practice caused or
30 predictably will cause a disparate impact. If the claimant meets such burden of
31 proof, the respondent has the burden of proving that the challenged practice is
32 necessary to achieve one or more substantial, legitimate and nondiscriminatory
33 interests of the respondent. If the respondent meets his or her burden of proof, the
34 complainant may still prevail upon proving that the substantial, legitimate and
35 nondiscriminatory interests supporting the challenged practice could be served by
36 another practice that has a less discriminatory effect.
37 Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to include section 1 in the
38 Nevada Fair Housing Law.
39 Section 3 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law relating to
40 discrimination in housing to the provisions of section 1.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 118 of NRS is hereby amended by adding
2 thereto a new section to read as follows:
3 1. Except as otherwise provided in this section, liability may
4 be established for a discriminatory housing practice if:
5 (a) The practice was motivated by a discriminatory intent; or
6 (b) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the practice
7 was not motivated by a discriminatory intent but the practice
8 actually or predictably results in a disparate impact on a group of
9 persons or creates, increases, reinforces or perpetuates segregated
10 housing patterns because of race, religious creed, color, national
11 origin, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression,
12 ancestry, familial status or sex.
13 2. There is no liability for a discriminatory housing practice
14 pursuant to paragraph (b) of subsection 1 if, based on evidence
15 that is not hypothetical or speculative:
16 (a) The practice is necessary to achieve one or more
17 substantial, legitimate and nondiscriminatory interests of the
18 respondent; and
19 (b) The interests of the respondent described in paragraph (a)
20 could not be served by another practice that has a less
21 discriminatory effect.
22 3. For purposes of paragraph (b) of subsection 1, the
23 complainant must establish that a challenged practice caused or
24 predictably will cause a disparate impact. If the complainant meets

1 such burden of proof, the respondent has the burden of proving
2 that the challenged practice is necessary to achieve one or more
3 substantial, legitimate and nondiscriminatory interests of the
4 respondent. If the respondent meets his or her burden of proof, the
5 complainant may still prevail upon proving that the substantial,
6 legitimate and nondiscriminatory interests supporting the
7 challenged practice could be served by another practice that has a
8 less discriminatory effect.
9 4. As used in this section:
10 (a) “Complainant” means a person by whom, or on whose
11 behalf:
12 (1) A complaint is filed with the Commission pursuant to

14 (2) An action is commenced pursuant to NRS 118.120.
15 (b) “Respondent” means a person against whom:
16 (1) A complaint is filed with the Commission pursuant to
17 NRS 118.110; or
18 (2) An action is commenced pursuant to NRS 118.120.
19 Sec. 2. NRS 118.010 is hereby amended to read as follows:
20 118.010 The provisions of NRS 118.010 to 118.120, inclusive,
21 and section 1 of this act may be cited as the Nevada Fair Housing
22 Law.
23 Sec. 3. NRS 118.030 is hereby amended to read as follows:

25 section 1 of this act, unless the context otherwise requires, the
26 words and terms defined in NRS 118.040 to 118.093, inclusive,
27 have the meanings ascribed to them in those sections.
