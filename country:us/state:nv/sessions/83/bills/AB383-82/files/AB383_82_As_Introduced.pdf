EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; prohibiting a governmental entity
from substantially burdening certain activity relating to
reproductive health services under certain circumstances;
authorizing a person whose engagement in such activity
has been so burdened to assert the violation as a claim or
defense in a judicial proceeding; authorizing a court to
award damages against a governmental entity that
substantially burdens such activity in certain
circumstances; expanding required coverage of
contraception under the State Plan for Medicaid; making
appropriations to and authorizing expenditures by the
Division of Health Care Financing and Policy of the
Department of Health and Human Services; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prescribes certain rights for a patient of a medical facility or a
2 facility for the dependent. (NRS 449A.100-449A.124) Sections 2-7 of this bill
3 establish the Right to Reproductive Health Care Act. Sections 4-5.5 of this bill
4 define certain terms for purposes of the Act. Section 6 of this bill applies the
5 provisions of the Act to certain state laws and all local laws and ordinances and the
-
*AB383_R2*

– 2 –
6 implementation of those laws and ordinances, regardless of when those laws or
7 ordinances were enacted. Section 7 of this bill generally prohibits a governmental
8 entity from enacting or implementing any limitation or requirement that singles out
9 reproductive health services and substantially burdens: (1) the access of a person to
10 reproductive health services, drugs or devices related to reproductive health
11 services or information related to reproductive health services; or (2) the ability of a
12 provider of health care to provide reproductive health services, drugs or devices
13 related to reproductive health services or information related to reproductive health
14 services within his or her scope of practice, training and experience. Section 7
15 creates an exception to such prohibitions if the governmental entity demonstrates
16 by clear and convincing evidence that the burden, as applied to the person or
17 provider of health care who is subject to the burden: (1) furthers a compelling
18 interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that interest. Section 7
19 authorizes a person whose ability to obtain or provide reproductive health services,
20 drugs or devices related to reproductive health services or information related to
21 reproductive health services is burdened to bring or defend an action in court and
22 obtain appropriate relief. Section 7 requires a court to award costs and attorney’s
23 fees to a person who prevails on such a claim.
24 Existing law requires the State Plan for Medicaid to include coverage for
25 certain contraceptive drugs and devices, including: (1) up to a 12-month supply of
26 contraceptive drugs; (2) certain devices for contraception; and (3) voluntary
27 sterilization for women. (NRS 422.27172) Section 8 of this bill additionally
28 requires the State Plan for Medicaid to cover: (1) voluntary sterilization for men;
29 (2) clinical services relating to covered contraceptive drugs, devices and services;
30 and (3) the cost of language translation services provided to facilitate the provision
31 of covered contraceptive drugs, devices and services. Section 8 requires the
32 Division of Health Care Financing and Policy of the Department of Health and
33 Human Services to develop a methodology establishing a rate of compensation for
34 such translation services that is cost effective and comparable to the rate paid for
35 translation services by other governmental entities that arrange for the provision of
36 such services. Section 8 also requires the State Plan to: (1) cover certain
37 contraceptive services when provided by any provider of health care for whom the
38 services are within his or her scope of practice, training and experience; (2)
39 reimburse a provider of health care, other than a physician, physician assistant or
40 advanced practice registered nurse, for providing such services at a rate that is not
41 less than the rate provided to a physician, physician assistant or advanced practice
42 registered nurse; and (3) cover such services regardless of whether the services are
43 provided in an inpatient or outpatient setting.
44 Section 20.5 of this bill makes appropriations to, and authorizes expenditures
45 by, the Division for costs of providing Medicaid coverage for translation services
46 and certain other purposes.
