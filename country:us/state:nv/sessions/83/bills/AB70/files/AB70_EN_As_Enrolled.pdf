Assembly Bill No. 70–Committee
on Growth and Infrastructure
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to energy; authorizing the board of county
commissioners of a county to require applicants for a partial
abatement of certain taxes imposed on certain renewable
energy facilities to reimburse the county for costs incurred by
the county to participate in the preparation of a federal
environmental impact statement; authorizing the Director of
the Office of Energy within the Office of the Governor to
condition approval of such a partial abatement on compliance
with the requirement to pay such a reimbursement;
prohibiting a county from taking certain actions with respect
to a renewable energy facility that the county has approved or
recommended approval for a partial abatement; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law authorizes certain renewable energy facilities to apply to the
Director of the Office of Energy within the Office of the Governor for a partial
abatement of certain sales and use taxes and property taxes. As soon as practicable
after the Director receives such an application, existing law requires the Director to
forward a copy of the application to certain persons and entities, including the
board of county commissioners. (NRS 701A.360) Under existing law, the Director
is prohibited from approving the application unless the application is: (1) approved
by the board of county commissioners; or (2) deemed approved by the board of
county commissioners because the board of county commissioners has not
approved or disapproved the application within a certain period after the board of
county commissioners receives from the Director a copy of the application.
(NRS 701A.365)
Section 1 of this bill authorizes the board of county commissioners of a county,
unless an alternative cost recovery mechanism has been adopted by the county, to
require an applicant for a partial abatement of certain taxes imposed on a renewable
energy facility located on federal land within the county to reimburse the county for
actual administrative and operational costs incurred by the county, in an amount not
to exceed $50,000, to participate in the preparation of an environmental impact
statement required with respect to the facility pursuant to the National
Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 42 U.S.C. §§ 4321 et seq. Under section 1: (1)
the applicant is authorized to require that the county provide documentation of the
actual costs for which the county is seeking reimbursement; and (2) the county is
authorized to require the applicant to prepay the anticipated amount of such costs,
with the county refunding the amount of any prepayment that exceeds the actual
costs for which the county is seeking reimbursement. Section 2.5 of this bill
authorizes the Director to condition approval of the application for the partial
abatement on the compliance of the applicant with the requirements of section 1.
Section 2.5 also prohibits a board of county commissioners from: (1) imposing
certain requirements for the applicant to obtain a special use permit for the facility
that would reasonably and foreseeably result in the development or operation of the
facility becoming financially or operationally impractical or impossible; or (2)

applying to the facility any moratorium on the construction or operation of a
renewable energy facility.
Section 2 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law relating to the
partial abatement of certain taxes for certain renewable energy projects to the
provisions of section 1.

in an amount not to exceed $50,000, for the actual administrative
and operational costs incurred by the county for its involvement in
the process of preparing any environmental impact statement
required with respect to the facility pursuant to the National
Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 42 U.S.C. §§ 4321 et seq,

mechanism or fee structure to recover such costs.

section and NRS 701A.300 to 701A.390, inclusive, who is required
