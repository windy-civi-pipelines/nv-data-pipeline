AN ACT relating to energy; [requiring] authorizing the board of county
commissioners of a county to require applicants for a partial
abatement of certain taxes imposed on certain renewable energy
facilities to reimburse the county for costs incurred by the county
to participate in the preparation of a federal environmental impact
statement; authorizing the Director of the Office of Energy within the
Office of the Governor to [consider certain written comments of a
board of county commissioners upon receipt of an application for]
condition approval of such a partial abatement [of certain taxes by
certain renewable energy facilities;] on compliance with the
requirement to pay such a reimbursement; prohibiting a county
from taking certain actions with respect to a renewable energy
facility that the county has approved or recommended approval
for a partial abatement; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes certain renewable energy facilities to apply to the Director of the
2 Office of Energy within the Office of the Governor for a partial abatement of certain sales and
3 use taxes and property taxes. As soon as practicable after the Director receives such an
4 application, existing law requires the Director to forward a copy of the application to certain
5 persons and entities, including the board of county commissioners. (NRS 701A.360) Under
6 existing law, the Director is prohibited from approving the application unless the
7 application is: (1) approved by the board of county commissioners; or (2) deemed
8 approved by the board of county commissioners because the board of county
9 commissioners has not approved or disapproved the application within a certain period
10 after the board of county commissioners receives from the Director a copy of the
11 application. (NRS 701A.365)
12 Section 1 of this bill [requires that, in addition to any other requirement set forth in
13 existing law, the Director: (1) provide] authorizes the board of county commissioners of [the]
14 a county [in which the facility will be located an opportunity to submit written comments on

Assembly Amendment No. 538 to Assembly Bill No. 70 Page 4
15 the application; and (2) consider any written comments received from the board of county
16 commissioners when determining whether to approve or deny the application.] , unless an
17 alternative cost recovery mechanism has been adopted by the county, to require an
18 applicant for a partial abatement of certain taxes imposed on a renewable energy facility
19 located on federal land within the county to reimburse the county for actual
20 administrative and operational costs incurred by the county, in an amount not to exceed
21 $50,000, to participate in the preparation of an environmental impact statement
22 required with respect to the facility pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act
23 of 1969, 42 U.S.C. §§ 4321 et seq. Under section 1: (1) the applicant is authorized to
24 require that the county provide documentation of the actual costs for which the county is
25 seeking reimbursement; and (2) the county is authorized to require the applicant to
26 prepay the anticipated amount of such costs, with the county refunding the amount of
27 any prepayment that exceeds the actual costs for which the county is seeking
28 reimbursement. Section 2.5 of this bill authorizes the Director to condition approval of
29 the application for the partial abatement on the compliance of the applicant with the
30 requirements of section 1. Section 2.5 also prohibits a board of county commissioners
31 from: (1) imposing certain requirements for the applicant to obtain a special use permit
32 for the facility that would reasonably and foreseeably result in the development or
33 operation of the facility becoming financially or operationally impractical or impossible;
34 or (2) applying to the facility any moratorium on the construction or operation of a
35 renewable energy facility.
36 Section 2 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law relating to the partial
37 abatement of certain taxes for certain renewable energy projects to the provisions of section 1.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 701A of NRS is hereby amended by adding thereto a new
2 section to read as follows:
3 [In addition to any other requirement set forth in NRS 701A.300 to 701A.390,
4 inclusive, the Director shall:
5 1. Provide the board of county commissioners of the county in which the
6 facility will be located an opportunity to submit written comments on an
7 application; and
8 2. Consider any written comments received from the board of county
9 commissioners when determining whether to approve or deny an application for
10 a partial abatement.]
11 1. The board of county commissioners of a county may require an applicant
12 for a partial abatement pursuant to this section and NRS 701A.300 to 701A.390,
13 inclusive, for a facility located on federal land within the county to reimburse the
14 county, in an amount not to exceed $50,000, for the actual administrative and
15 operational costs incurred by the county for its involvement in the process of
16 preparing any environmental impact statement required with respect to the
17 facility pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 42 U.S.C. §§
18 4321 et seq, unless the board of county commissioners has adopted any other
19 mechanism or fee structure to recover such costs.
20 2. An applicant for a partial abatement pursuant to this section and NRS
21 701A.300 to 701A.390, inclusive, who is required to pay a reimbursement to a

24 reimbursement pursuant to subsection 1.
25 3. A county requiring an applicant for a partial abatement pursuant to this
26 section and NRS 701A.300 to 701A.390, inclusive, to pay a reimbursement to the

Assembly Amendment No. 538 to Assembly Bill No. 70 Page 5
27 county pursuant to subsection 1 may require the applicant to prepay the
28 anticipated amount of the reimbursement. If the amount of the actual costs
29 incurred by the county for which reimbursement is required pursuant to
30 subsection 1:
31 (a) Exceeds the amount of the prepayment, the applicant must pay the county
32 the difference between the prepayment and the actual costs incurred by the
33 county.
34 (b) Is less than the amount of the prepayment, the county must refund to the
35 applicant the difference between the actual costs incurred by the county and the
36 amount of the prepayment.
37 4. For the purposes of this section, unless the applicant and the county
38 agree otherwise, the provisions of subsection 1 apply to a single facility,
