AN ACT relating to energy; authorizing the board of county
commissioners of a county to require applicants for a
partial abatement of certain taxes imposed on certain
renewable energy facilities to reimburse the county for
costs incurred by the county to participate in the
preparation of a federal environmental impact statement;
authorizing the Director of the Office of Energy within
the Office of the Governor to condition approval of such a
partial abatement on compliance with the requirement to
pay such a reimbursement; prohibiting a county from
taking certain actions with respect to a renewable energy
facility that the county has approved or recommended
approval for a partial abatement; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes certain renewable energy facilities to apply to the
2 Director of the Office of Energy within the Office of the Governor for a partial
3 abatement of certain sales and use taxes and property taxes. As soon as practicable
4 after the Director receives such an application, existing law requires the Director to
5 forward a copy of the application to certain persons and entities, including the
6 board of county commissioners. (NRS 701A.360) Under existing law, the Director
7 is prohibited from approving the application unless the application is: (1) approved
8 by the board of county commissioners; or (2) deemed approved by the board of
9 county commissioners because the board of county commissioners has not
10 approved or disapproved the application within a certain period after the board of
-

11 county commissioners receives from the Director a copy of the application.
12 (NRS 701A.365)
13 Section 1 of this bill authorizes the board of county commissioners of a county,
14 unless an alternative cost recovery mechanism has been adopted by the county, to
15 require an applicant for a partial abatement of certain taxes imposed on a renewable
16 energy facility located on federal land within the county to reimburse the county for
17 actual administrative and operational costs incurred by the county, in an amount not
18 to exceed $50,000, to participate in the preparation of an environmental impact
19 statement required with respect to the facility pursuant to the National
20 Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 42 U.S.C. §§ 4321 et seq. Under section 1: (1)
21 the applicant is authorized to require that the county provide documentation of the
22 actual costs for which the county is seeking reimbursement; and (2) the county is
23 authorized to require the applicant to prepay the anticipated amount of such costs,
24 with the county refunding the amount of any prepayment that exceeds the actual
25 costs for which the county is seeking reimbursement. Section 2.5 of this bill
26 authorizes the Director to condition approval of the application for the partial
27 abatement on the compliance of the applicant with the requirements of section 1.
28 Section 2.5 also prohibits a board of county commissioners from: (1) imposing
29 certain requirements for the applicant to obtain a special use permit for the facility
30 that would reasonably and foreseeably result in the development or operation of the
31 facility becoming financially or operationally impractical or impossible; or (2)
32 applying to the facility any moratorium on the construction or operation of a
33 renewable energy facility.
34 Section 2 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law relating to the
35 partial abatement of certain taxes for certain renewable energy projects to the
36 provisions of section 1.
