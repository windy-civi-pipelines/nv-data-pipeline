CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to pharmacy; establishing requirements governing
the maintenance of secure drug take-back bins for the
collection and destruction of unused drugs; providing that
entities that maintain a secure drug take-back bin in
accordance with such requirements are not subject to certain
discipline for certain injuries and harms; requiring an
allocation from the Fund for a Resilient Nevada to the State
Board of Pharmacy to assist with the collection and
destruction of unused drugs; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing federal regulations authorize pharmacies, hospitals and other entities
authorized to handle controlled substances to register with the Drug Enforcement
Administration of the United States Department of Justice to obtain authorization to
be a collector of controlled substances. Existing federal regulations authorize such
collectors to: (1) conduct mail-back programs for the return of controlled
substances; and (2) maintain collection receptacles for disposal of the controlled
substances. (21 C.F.R. §§ 1317.40, 1317.70, 1317.75) Existing federal regulations
also prescribe standards governing the disposal of controlled substances by entities
authorized to handle and dispose of controlled substances. (21 C.F.R. Part 1317)
Existing regulations of the State Board of Pharmacy require an entity that is
authorized pursuant to federal law and conducts such a mail-back program or
maintains such collection receptacles to provide to the Board: (1) written
notification of the registration of the entity with the Drug Enforcement
Administration to be a collector; and (2) copies of a certain federal form which is
required to document the destruction of controlled substances. (NAC 639.050)
Existing regulations of the Board also prescribe standards for the destruction of
controlled substances, which mirror the relevant federal regulations.
(NAC 639.498)

Section 2:
Section 1 of this bill prescribes requirements for the installation and
maintenance of secure drug take-back bins by a collector that is registered with the
Drug Enforcement Administration for the on-site collection and destruction of
home-generated pharmaceutical waste. Specifically, section 1 requires such a
collector to: (1) comply with all applicable state and federal laws and regulations;
(2) notify at least one local law enforcement agency of any suspected or known
tampering or theft or significant loss of controlled substances from a secure drug
take-back bin that occurs while the bin is under the control of the collector; (3) post
signage notifying customers of the substances that are and are not acceptable for
deposit into the secure drug take-back bin; (4) regularly monitor and inspect the bin
and surrounding area, including by limiting customer access to the bin to certain
hours when the bin is being actively monitored; and (5) maintain records of such
inspections and other records required by law. Section 1 also prohibits such a
collector from receiving any compensation from a customer to maintain the secure
drug take-back bin. Section 1: (1) provides that a collector that complies with such
requirements is not subject to discipline by the Board for any injury or harm that
directly results from the collector maintaining a secure drug take-back bin, unless
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 2 –
the injury or harm directly resulted from the gross negligence or willful and wanton
misconduct of the collector; and (2) relieves such a collector from compliance with
any restriction established by the governing body of a county, city or other local
governmental entity that would affect the collection and destruction of the contents
of a secure drug take-back bin.
Existing law creates the Fund for a Resilient Nevada and requires the Attorney
General to deposit in the Fund money received by this State pursuant to any
judgment received or settlement entered into by the State of Nevada as a result of
certain litigation concerning the manufacture, distribution, sale or marketing of
opioids. Existing law requires the Director of the Department of Health and Human
Services to administer the Fund. (NRS 433.732) Section 2 of this bill requires the
Director to allocate $500,000 from the Fund to the State Board of Pharmacy to
assist collectors with the destruction of home-generated pharmaceutical waste
deposited in a secure drug take-back bin.
