EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to pharmacy; establishing requirements governing
the maintenance of secure drug take-back bins for the
collection and destruction of unused drugs; providing that
entities that maintain a secure drug take-back bin in
accordance with such requirements are not subject to
certain discipline for certain injuries and harms; making
an appropriation; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing federal regulations authorize pharmacies, hospitals and other entities
2 authorized to handle controlled substances to register with the Drug Enforcement
3 Administration of the United States Department of Justice to obtain authorization to
4 be a collector of controlled substances. Existing federal regulations authorize such
5 collectors to: (1) conduct mail-back programs for the return of controlled
6 substances; and (2) maintain collection receptacles for disposal of the controlled
7 substances. (21 C.F.R. §§ 1317.40, 1317.70, 1317.75) Existing federal regulations
8 also prescribe standards governing the disposal of controlled substances by entities
9 authorized to handle and dispose of controlled substances. (21 C.F.R. Part 1317)
10 Existing regulations of the State Board of Pharmacy require an entity that is
11 authorized pursuant to federal law and conducts such a mail-back program or
12 maintains such collection receptacles to provide to the Board: (1) written
13 notification of the registration of the entity with the Drug Enforcement
14 Administration to be a collector; and (2) copies of a certain federal form which is
15 required to document the destruction of controlled substances. (NAC 639.050)
16 Existing regulations of the Board also prescribe standards for the destruction of
17 controlled substances, which mirror the relevant federal regulations.

19 Section 1 of this bill prescribes requirements for the installation and
20 maintenance of secure drug take-back bins by a collector that is registered with the
21 Drug Enforcement Administration for the on-site collection and destruction of
22 home-generated pharmaceutical waste. Specifically, section 1 requires such a
23 collector to: (1) comply with all applicable state and federal laws and regulations;
24 (2) notify at least one local law enforcement agency of any suspected or known
25 tampering or theft or significant loss of controlled substances from a secure drug
26 take-back bin that occurs while the bin is under the control of the collector; (3) post
27 signage notifying customers of the substances that are and are not acceptable for
28 deposit into the secure drug take-back bin; (4) regularly monitor and inspect the bin
29 and surrounding area, including by limiting customer access to the bin to certain
30 hours when the bin is being actively monitored; and (5) maintain records of such
31 inspections and other records acquired by law. Section 1 also prohibits such a
32 collector from receiving any compensation from a customer to maintain the secure
33 drug take-back bin. Section 1: (1) provides that a collector that complies with such
34 requirements is not subject to discipline by the Board for any injury or harm that
35 directly results from the collector maintaining a secure drug take-back bin, unless
36 the injury or harm directly resulted from the gross negligence or willful and wanton
37 misconduct of the collector; and (2) relieves such a collector from compliance with
38 any restriction established by the governing body of a county, city or other local
39 governmental entity that would affect the collection and destruction of the contents
40 of a secure drug take-back bin.
41 Existing law creates the Fund for a Resilient Nevada and requires the Attorney
42 General to deposit in the Fund money received by this State pursuant to any
43 judgment received or settlement entered into by the State of Nevada as a result of
44 certain litigation concerning the manufacture, distribution, sale or marketing of
45 opioids. (NRS 433.732) Section 2 of this bill appropriates $500,000 from the Fund
46 to the Division of Public and Behavioral Health of the Department of Health and
47 Human Services to assist collectors with the destruction of home-generated
48 pharmaceutical waste deposited in a secure drug take-back bin.
