EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to pharmacy; establishing requirements governing the
maintenance of secure drug take-back bins for the collection and
destruction of unused drugs; providing that entities that maintain a
secure drug take-back bin in accordance with such requirements are
not subject to certain discipline for certain injuries and harms; [making
an appropriation;] requiring an allocation from the Fund for a
Resilient Nevada to the State Board of Pharmacy to assist with the
collection and destruction of unused drugs; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing federal regulations authorize pharmacies, hospitals and other entities authorized
2 to handle controlled substances to register with the Drug Enforcement Administration of the
3 United States Department of Justice to obtain authorization to be a collector of controlled
4 substances. Existing federal regulations authorize such collectors to: (1) conduct mail-back
5 programs for the return of controlled substances; and (2) maintain collection receptacles for
6 disposal of the controlled substances. (21 C.F.R. §§ 1317.40, 1317.70, 1317.75) Existing
7 federal regulations also prescribe standards governing the disposal of controlled substances by
8 entities authorized to handle and dispose of controlled substances. (21 C.F.R. Part 1317)
9 Existing regulations of the State Board of Pharmacy require an entity that is authorized
10 pursuant to federal law and conducts such a mail-back program or maintains such collection
11 receptacles to provide to the Board: (1) written notification of the registration of the entity
12 with the Drug Enforcement Administration to be a collector; and (2) copies of a certain
13 federal form which is required to document the destruction of controlled substances. (NAC
14 639.050) Existing regulations of the Board also prescribe standards for the destruction of
15 controlled substances, which mirror the relevant federal regulations. (NAC 639.498)
16 Section 1 of this bill prescribes requirements for the installation and maintenance of
17 secure drug take-back bins by a collector that is registered with the Drug Enforcement
18 Administration for the on-site collection and destruction of home-generated pharmaceutical
19 waste. Specifically, section 1 requires such a collector to: (1) comply with all applicable state
20 and federal laws and regulations; (2) notify at least one local law enforcement agency of any
21 suspected or known tampering or theft or significant loss of controlled substances from a

Senate Amendment No. 721 to Senate Bill No. 231 Page 4
22 secure drug take-back bin that occurs while the bin is under the control of the collector; (3)
23 post signage notifying customers of the substances that are and are not acceptable for deposit
24 into the secure drug take-back bin; (4) regularly monitor and inspect the bin and surrounding
25 area, including by limiting customer access to the bin to certain hours when the bin is being
26 actively monitored; and (5) maintain records of such inspections and other records required by
27 law. Section 1 also prohibits such a collector from receiving any compensation from a
28 customer to maintain the secure drug take-back bin. Section 1: (1) provides that a collector
29 that complies with such requirements is not subject to discipline by the Board for any injury or
30 harm that directly results from the collector maintaining a secure drug take-back bin, unless
31 the injury or harm directly resulted from the gross negligence or willful and wanton
32 misconduct of the collector; and (2) relieves such a collector from compliance with any
33 restriction established by the governing body of a county, city or other local governmental
34 entity that would affect the collection and destruction of the contents of a secure drug take-
35 back bin.
36 Existing law creates the Fund for a Resilient Nevada and requires the Attorney General to
37 deposit in the Fund money received by this State pursuant to any judgment received or
38 settlement entered into by the State of Nevada as a result of certain litigation concerning the
39 manufacture, distribution, sale or marketing of opioids. Existing law requires the Director
40 of the Department of Health and Human Services to administer the Fund. (NRS 433.732)
41 Section 2 of this bill [appropriates] requires the Director to allocate $500,000 from the
42 Fund to the [Division of Public and Behavioral Health of the Department of Health and
43 Human Services] State Board of Pharmacy to assist collectors with the destruction of home-
44 generated pharmaceutical waste deposited in a secure drug take-back bin.
