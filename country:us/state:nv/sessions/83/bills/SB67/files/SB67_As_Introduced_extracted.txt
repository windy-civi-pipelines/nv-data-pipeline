Referred to Committee on Judiciary
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to certain actions and
proceedings. (BDR 3-447)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to civil actions; revising provisions governing the
legal representation of certain persons by the Attorney
General or the chief legal officer or authorized legal
representative of a political subdivision; revising
requirements relating to a special verdict form in certain
actions; revising provisions governing indemnification of
certain persons in certain civil actions; revising provisions
governing civil liability of public employers for certain
conduct of employees; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Attorney General or the chief legal officer or other
2 authorized representative of a political subdivision of this State to provide legal
3 representation for the defense of officers or employees of the State or a political
4 subdivision of the State who are named as defendants in a civil action and certain
5 other persons. Under existing law, a person who wishes to receive such services
6 must submit a written request for defense within 15 days after service of a copy of
7 the summons and complaint or other legal document commencing the action. (NRS
8 41.0339) Section 1 of this bill instead requires the submission of a written request
9 for defense within 15 days after the date on which: (1) the person receives service
10 of a copy of the summons and complaint or other legal document commencing the
11 action or waives such service; or (2) a court of competent jurisdiction enters an
12 order finding that the person was served by an alternative service method.
13 Existing law: (1) authorizes a person who submits a written request for defense
14 to employ his or her own counsel at any time after the request is submitted; and (2)
15 relieves the State or political subdivision of the State of any further duty to
16 represent the person at the time at which the person employs his or her own
-
*SB67*
– 2 –
17 counsel. (NRS 41.03455) Section 2 of this bill eliminates language authorizing a
18 person to employ his or her own legal counsel at any time after the submission of a
19 written request for defense. Section 2 thereby: (1) authorizes a person who has not
20 submitted a written request for defense to employ his or her own counsel; and (2)
21 relieves the State or political subdivision of the State of any duty to represent a
22 person who employs his or her own counsel at the time at which the person retains
23 such counsel, regardless of whether the person has submitted a written request for
24 defense on or before that date.
25 In certain cases in which the State or a political subdivision of the State are
26 named defendants, existing law requires a court or jury of this State to return a
27 special verdict in the form of certain specific written findings. (NRS 41.0348)
28 Section 3 of this bill revises the required written findings. Section 3 also removes
29 specific language referring to a court or jury of this State, which could make the
30 special verdict requirement applicable to a case in another jurisdiction if Nevada
31 law is applied in such a case.
32 Existing law requires the State or a political subdivision of the State to
33 indemnify certain officers or employees of the State or a political subdivision of the
34 State for damages caused by any act or omission relating to the public duty or
35 employment of the person, unless an exception applies. (NRS 41.0349) Section 4
36 of this bill revises the circumstances under which the State or a political subdivision
37 of the State is exempt from the requirement to indemnify a person. Section 4 also
38 authorizes the State or a political subdivision of the State to indemnify a person
39 against liability for exemplary or punitive damages under certain circumstances.
40 Existing law generally protects a public employer from liability for harm or
41 injury caused by the conduct of a person that was outside the course and scope of
42 the public duties or employment of the person and was not reasonably foreseeable.
43 (NRS 41.03475, 41.745) Section 5 of this bill additionally protects a public
44 employer from liability for a deprivation of constitutional rights caused by the
45 conduct of an employee or officer of the public employer unless: (1) the public
46 employer was personally involved in the deprivation; or (2) a sufficient causal
47 connection exists between wrongful conduct of the public employer and the
48 deprivation.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 41.0339 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 41.0339 1. The official attorney shall provide for the defense,
3 including the defense of cross-claims and counterclaims, of any
4 present or former local judicial officer, state judicial officer, officer
5 or employee of the State or a political subdivision, immune
6 contractor or State Legislator in any civil action brought against that
7 person based on any alleged act or omission relating to the person’s
8 public duties or employment, or any other person who is named as a
9 defendant in a civil action solely because of an alleged act or
10 omission relating to the public duties or employment of a local
11 judicial officer, state judicial officer, officer or employee of the
12 State or a political subdivision, immune contractor or State
13 Legislator, if:
-

5 (1) To the official attorney; or
6 (2) If the officer, employee or immune contractor has an
7 administrative superior, to the administrator of the person’s agency
8 and the official attorney; and

10 on which the action is based appears to be within the course and
11 scope of public duty or employment and appears to have been
12 performed or omitted in good faith.
13 2. Regardless of the date on which the Attorney General,
14 person designated by the Attorney General or person serving in
15 the office of administrative head of the named agency receives
16 service pursuant to subsection 2 of NRS 41.031, a written request
17 for defense pursuant to subsection 1 must be submitted to the
18 official attorney and, if applicable, the administrator of the
19 person’s agency, within 15 days after the date on which:
20 (a) The person receives service of a copy of the summons and
21 complaint or other legal document commencing the action or
22 waives such service; or
23 (b) A court of competent jurisdiction enters an order finding
24 that the person was served by an alternative service method
25 pursuant to the Nevada Rules of Civil Procedure.
26 3. If the official attorney determines that it is impracticable,
27 uneconomical or could constitute a conflict of interest for the legal
28 service to be rendered by the official attorney or a deputy of the
29 official attorney, the official attorney must employ special counsel
30 pursuant to NRS 41.03435 or 41.0344, whichever is applicable.
31 Sec. 2. NRS 41.03455 is hereby amended to read as follows:
32 41.03455 [At any time after] A person authorized to submit a
33 written request for defense [is submitted] pursuant to [the official
34 attorney, the person requesting the defense] NRS 41.0339 may
35 employ his or her own counsel to defend the action. [At that time,]
36 Upon the retention by a person of his or her own legal counsel, the
37 State or political subdivision is excused from any further duty to
38 represent [that] the person and is not liable for any expenses in
39 defending the action, including court costs and attorney’s fees.
40 Sec. 3. NRS 41.0348 is hereby amended to read as follows:
41 41.0348 In every action or proceeding in any court [of this
42 state] in which both the State or political subdivision and any
43 present or former officer, employee, immune contractor or member
44 of a board or commission thereof or any present or former State
45 Legislator are named defendants, the court or jury in rendering any
-
*SB67*
– 4 –
1 final judgment, verdict, or other disposition shall return a special
2 verdict in the form of written findings which determine whether:
3 1. The individual defendant was acting within the scope of the
4 defendant’s public duty or employment; and
5 2. [The] Clear and convincing evidence establishes that the
6 alleged act or omission by the individual defendant [was wanton]
7 involved oppression, fraud or [malicious.] malice, express or
8 implied, as those terms are defined in NRS 42.001.
9 Sec. 4. NRS 41.0349 is hereby amended to read as follows:
10 41.0349 1. [In] Except as otherwise provided in subsection

13 the State or a political subdivision or State Legislator, in which a
14 judgment is entered against the person based on any act or omission
15 relating to the person’s public duty or employment, the State or
16 political subdivision shall indemnify the person unless:
17 [1.] (a) The person failed to submit a timely request for
18 defense;
19 [2.] (b) The person failed to cooperate in good faith in the
20 defense of the action;
21 [3.] (c) The act or omission of the person was not within the
22 scope of the person’s public duty or employment [; or
23 4.] , including, without limitation, where the person was
24 terminated from employment or resigned in lieu of termination
25 based upon a determination by the State or political subdivision
26 that the act or omission was not within the scope of the person’s
27 public duty or employment;
28 (d) The person has been held criminally liable for the act or
29 omission which is the subject of the civil action; or
30 (e) The act or omission of the person [was wanton] results in
31 exemplary or [malicious.] punitive damages.

33 if:
34 (a) The exemplary or punitive damages are related to a
35 violation of state or federal law; and
36 (b) In the opinion of the official attorney:

41 good faith; and

11 the employee; and
12 (c) Was not reasonably foreseeable under the facts and
13 circumstances of the case considering the nature and scope of his or

18 probability of injury.
19 2. Nothing in this section imposes strict liability on an
20 employer for any unforeseeable intentional act of an employee.
21 3. A public employer shall not be subject to liability based

SENATE BILL NO. 67–COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY
(ON BEHALF OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL)
PREFILED NOVEMBER 20, 2024
____________
Referred to Committee on Judiciary
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to certain actions and
proceedings. (BDR 3-447)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to civil actions; revising provisions governing the
legal representation of certain persons by the Attorney
General or the chief legal officer or authorized legal
representative of a political subdivision; revising
requirements relating to a special verdict form in certain
actions; revising provisions governing indemnification of
certain persons in certain civil actions; revising provisions
governing civil liability of public employers for certain
conduct of employees; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Attorney General or the chief legal officer or other
2 authorized representative of a political subdivision of this State to provide legal
3 representation for the defense of officers or employees of the State or a political
4 subdivision of the State who are named as defendants in a civil action and certain
5 other persons. Under existing law, a person who wishes to receive such services
6 must submit a written request for defense within 15 days after service of a copy of
7 the summons and complaint or other legal document commencing the action. (NRS
8 41.0339) Section 1 of this bill instead requires the submission of a written request
9 for defense within 15 days after the date on which: (1) the person receives service
10 of a copy of the summons and complaint or other legal document commencing the
11 action or waives such service; or (2) a court of competent jurisdiction enters an
12 order finding that the person was served by an alternative service method.
13 Existing law: (1) authorizes a person who submits a written request for defense
14 to employ his or her own counsel at any time after the request is submitted; and (2)
15 relieves the State or political subdivision of the State of any further duty to
16 represent the person at the time at which the person employs his or her own
-
*SB67*

– 2 –
17 counsel. (NRS 41.03455) Section 2 of this bill eliminates language authorizing a
18 person to employ his or her own legal counsel at any time after the submission of a
19 written request for defense. Section 2 thereby: (1) authorizes a person who has not
20 submitted a written request for defense to employ his or her own counsel; and (2)
21 relieves the State or political subdivision of the State of any duty to represent a
22 person who employs his or her own counsel at the time at which the person retains
23 such counsel, regardless of whether the person has submitted a written request for
24 defense on or before that date.
25 In certain cases in which the State or a political subdivision of the State are
26 named defendants, existing law requires a court or jury of this State to return a
27 special verdict in the form of certain specific written findings. (NRS 41.0348)
28 Section 3 of this bill revises the required written findings. Section 3 also removes
29 specific language referring to a court or jury of this State, which could make the
30 special verdict requirement applicable to a case in another jurisdiction if Nevada
31 law is applied in such a case.
32 Existing law requires the State or a political subdivision of the State to
33 indemnify certain officers or employees of the State or a political subdivision of the
34 State for damages caused by any act or omission relating to the public duty or
35 employment of the person, unless an exception applies. (NRS 41.0349) Section 4
36 of this bill revises the circumstances under which the State or a political subdivision
37 of the State is exempt from the requirement to indemnify a person. Section 4 also
38 authorizes the State or a political subdivision of the State to indemnify a person
39 against liability for exemplary or punitive damages under certain circumstances.
40 Existing law generally protects a public employer from liability for harm or
41 injury caused by the conduct of a person that was outside the course and scope of
42 the public duties or employment of the person and was not reasonably foreseeable.
43 (NRS 41.03475, 41.745) Section 5 of this bill additionally protects a public
44 employer from liability for a deprivation of constitutional rights caused by the
45 conduct of an employee or officer of the public employer unless: (1) the public
46 employer was personally involved in the deprivation; or (2) a sufficient causal
47 connection exists between wrongful conduct of the public employer and the
48 deprivation.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 41.0339 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 41.0339 1. The official attorney shall provide for the defense,

4 present or former local judicial officer, state judicial officer, officer
5 or employee of the State or a political subdivision, immune
6 contractor or State Legislator in any civil action brought against that
7 person based on any alleged act or omission relating to the person’s
8 public duties or employment, or any other person who is named as a
9 defendant in a civil action solely because of an alleged act or
10 omission relating to the public duties or employment of a local
11 judicial officer, state judicial officer, officer or employee of the
12 State or a political subdivision, immune contractor or State
13 Legislator, if:

8 and the official attorney; and

10 on which the action is based appears to be within the course and
11 scope of public duty or employment and appears to have been
12 performed or omitted in good faith.
13 2. Regardless of the date on which the Attorney General,
14 person designated by the Attorney General or person serving in
15 the office of administrative head of the named agency receives
16 service pursuant to subsection 2 of NRS 41.031, a written request
17 for defense pursuant to subsection 1 must be submitted to the

24 that the person was served by an alternative service method

30 pursuant to NRS 41.03435 or 41.0344, whichever is applicable.
31 Sec. 2. NRS 41.03455 is hereby amended to read as follows:

33 written request for defense [is submitted] pursuant to [the official
34 attorney, the person requesting the defense] NRS 41.0339 may
35 employ his or her own counsel to defend the action. [At that time,]
36 Upon the retention by a person of his or her own legal counsel, the
37 State or political subdivision is excused from any further duty to
38 represent [that] the person and is not liable for any expenses in
39 defending the action, including court costs and attorney’s fees.
40 Sec. 3. NRS 41.0348 is hereby amended to read as follows:
41 41.0348 In every action or proceeding in any court [of this
42 state] in which both the State or political subdivision and any
43 present or former officer, employee, immune contractor or member
44 of a board or commission thereof or any present or former State
45 Legislator are named defendants, the court or jury in rendering any
-
*SB67*

– 4 –
1 final judgment, verdict, or other disposition shall return a special
2 verdict in the form of written findings which determine whether:
3 1. The individual defendant was acting within the scope of the
4 defendant’s public duty or employment; and
5 2. [The] Clear and convincing evidence establishes that the
6 alleged act or omission by the individual defendant [was wanton]
7 involved oppression, fraud or [malicious.] malice, express or
8 implied, as those terms are defined in NRS 42.001.
9 Sec. 4. NRS 41.0349 is hereby amended to read as follows:
10 41.0349 1. [In] Except as otherwise provided in subsection

13 the State or a political subdivision or State Legislator, in which a
14 judgment is entered against the person based on any act or omission

18 defense;
19 [2.] (b) The person failed to cooperate in good faith in the
20 defense of the action;
21 [3.] (c) The act or omission of the person was not within the
22 scope of the person’s public duty or employment [; or
23 4.] , including, without limitation, where the person was
24 terminated from employment or resigned in lieu of termination
25 based upon a determination by the State or political subdivision
26 that the act or omission was not within the scope of the person’s
27 public duty or employment;
28 (d) The person has been held criminally liable for the act or
29 omission which is the subject of the civil action; or
30 (e) The act or omission of the person [was wanton] results in
31 exemplary or [malicious.] punitive damages.

5 Sec. 5. NRS 41.745 is hereby amended to read as follows:
6 41.745 1. An employer is not liable for harm or injury caused
7 by the intentional conduct of an employee if the conduct of the

11 the employee; and
12 (c) Was not reasonably foreseeable under the facts and
13 circumstances of the case considering the nature and scope of his or
