AN ACT relating to juvenile justice; granting the juvenile court
limited jurisdiction over certain persons who are 21 years
of age or older; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law grants the juvenile court limited jurisdiction over a person who is
2 21 years of age or older if: (1) the person is charged with the commission of a
3 delinquent act that occurred when the person was at least 16 years of age but less
4 than 18 years of age; (2) the delinquent act would have been a category A or B
5 felony if committed by an adult; and (3) certain other requirements are met. (NRS
6 62B.335) The Nevada Supreme Court has held that existing law does not grant any
7 court in this State jurisdiction over a person who is 21 years of age or older who is
8 charged with the commission of certain delinquent acts that occurred when the
9 person was less than 16 years of age. (Zalyaul v. State, 138 Nev. 760 (2022))
10 Section 1 of this bill addresses this jurisdictional gap by granting the juvenile court
11 limited jurisdiction over a person who is 21 years of age or older if: (1) the person
12 is charged with the commission of a delinquent act that occurred when the person
13 was less than 16 years of age; (2) the delinquent act would have been a category A
14 or B felony if committed by an adult; and (3) certain other requirements are met.
15 Section 1 also grants the juvenile court limited jurisdiction over a person who is 21
16 years of age or older if: (1) the person is charged with the commission of a
17 delinquent act that occurred when the person was at least 16 years of age but less
18 than 18 years of age; (2) the delinquent act would have been a category A or B
19 felony if committed by an adult; and (3) certain other requirements are met.
20 In general, existing law requires the juvenile court to hold a hearing to
21 determine whether the case of a person over whom the juvenile court has limited
22 jurisdiction should be: (1) dismissed; or (2) transferred from the juvenile court to

23 the district court for criminal proceedings. (NRS 62B.335) By granting the juvenile
24 court limited jurisdiction over a person who is 21 years of age or older who is
25 charged with the commission of a delinquent act that occurred when the person was
26 less than 18 years of age, section 1 requires the juvenile court to hold a hearing to
27 determine whether the case of any such person should be dismissed or transferred
28 to the district court for criminal proceedings.
29 Section 2 of this bill makes the amendatory provisions of section 1 applicable
30 to offenses committed before, on or after the effective date of this bill.
