Section 1:
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to juvenile justice; granting the juvenile court
limited jurisdiction over certain persons who are 21 years of
age or older; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law grants the juvenile court limited jurisdiction over a person who is
21 years of age or older if: (1) the person is charged with the commission of a
delinquent act that occurred when the person was at least 16 years of age but less
than 18 years of age; (2) the delinquent act would have been a category A or B
felony if committed by an adult; and (3) certain other requirements are met. (NRS
62B.335) The Nevada Supreme Court has held that existing law does not grant any
court in this State jurisdiction over a person who is 21 years of age or older who is
charged with the commission of certain delinquent acts that occurred when the
person was less than 16 years of age. (Zalyaul v. State, 138 Nev. 760 (2022))

Section 2:
Section 1 of this bill addresses this jurisdictional gap by granting the juvenile court
limited jurisdiction over a person who is 21 years of age or older if a petition
charging the person with the commission of certain delinquent acts that occurred
when the person was at least 13 years of age but less than 18 years of age is filed
and certain other requirements are met.
In general, existing law requires the juvenile court to hold a hearing to
determine whether the case of a person over whom the juvenile court has limited
jurisdiction should be: (1) dismissed; or (2) transferred from the juvenile court to
the district court for criminal proceedings. (NRS 62B.335) By granting the juvenile
court limited jurisdiction over a person who is 21 years of age or older who is
charged with the commission of a delinquent act that occurred when the person was
less than 18 years of age, section 1 requires the juvenile court to hold a hearing and
consider certain factors relating to the interests of justice and need for protection of
the public to determine whether the case of any such person should be dismissed or
transferred to the district court for criminal proceedings.

Section 3:
Section 2 of this bill makes the amendatory provisions of section 1 applicable
to offenses committed on or after October 1, 2013.
