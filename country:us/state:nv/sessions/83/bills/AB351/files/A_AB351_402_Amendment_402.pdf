AN ACT relating to juvenile justice; granting the juvenile court limited jurisdiction
over certain persons who are 21 years of age or older; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law grants the juvenile court limited jurisdiction over a person who is 21 years of
2 age or older if: (1) the person is charged with the commission of a delinquent act that occurred
3 when the person was at least 16 years of age but less than 18 years of age; (2) the delinquent
4 act would have been a category A or B felony if committed by an adult; and (3) certain other
5 requirements are met. (NRS 62B.335) The Nevada Supreme Court has held that existing law
6 does not grant any court in this State jurisdiction over a person who is 21 years of age or older
7 who is charged with the commission of certain delinquent acts that occurred when the person
8 was less than 16 years of age. (Zalyaul v. State, 138 Nev. 760 (2022)) Section 1 of this bill
9 addresses this jurisdictional gap by granting the juvenile court limited jurisdiction over a
10 person who is 21 years of age or older if [: (1)] a petition charging the person [is charged]
11 with the commission of [a] certain delinquent [act] acts that occurred when the person was
12 [less than 16 years of age; (2) the delinquent act would have been a category A or B felony if
13 committed by an adult;] at least 13 years of age but less than 18 years of age is filed and
14 [(3)] certain other requirements are met. [Section 1 also grants the juvenile court limited
15 jurisdiction over a person who is 21 years of age or older if: (1) the person is charged with the
16 commission of a delinquent act that occurred when the person was at least 16 years of age but
17 less than 18 years of age; (2) the delinquent act would have been a category A or B felony if
18 committed by an adult; and (3) certain other requirements are met.]
19 In general, existing law requires the juvenile court to hold a hearing to determine whether
20 the case of a person over whom the juvenile court has limited jurisdiction should be: (1)
21 dismissed; or (2) transferred from the juvenile court to the district court for criminal
22 proceedings. (NRS 62B.335) By granting the juvenile court limited jurisdiction over a person
23 who is 21 years of age or older who is charged with the commission of a delinquent act that
24 occurred when the person was less than 18 years of age, section 1 requires the juvenile court
25 to hold a hearing to determine whether the case of any such person should be dismissed or
26 transferred to the district court for criminal proceedings.

28 committed [before,] on or after [the effective date of this bill.] October 1, 2013.
