AN ACT relating to juvenile justice; granting the juvenile court
limited jurisdiction over certain persons who are 21 years
of age or older; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law grants the juvenile court limited jurisdiction over a person who is
2 21 years of age or older if: (1) the person is charged with the commission of a
3 delinquent act that occurred when the person was at least 16 years of age but less
4 than 18 years of age; (2) the delinquent act would have been a category A or B
5 felony if committed by an adult; and (3) certain other requirements are met. (NRS
6 62B.335) The Nevada Supreme Court has held that existing law does not grant any
7 court in this State jurisdiction over a person who is 21 years of age or older who is
8 charged with the commission of certain delinquent acts that occurred when the
9 person was less than 16 years of age. (Zalyaul v. State, 138 Nev. 760 (2022))
10 Section 1 of this bill addresses this jurisdictional gap by granting the juvenile court
11 limited jurisdiction over a person who is 21 years of age or older if a petition
12 charging the person with the commission of certain delinquent acts that occurred
13 when the person was at least 13 years of age but less than 18 years of age is filed
14 and certain other requirements are met.
15 In general, existing law requires the juvenile court to hold a hearing to
16 determine whether the case of a person over whom the juvenile court has limited
17 jurisdiction should be: (1) dismissed; or (2) transferred from the juvenile court to
18 the district court for criminal proceedings. (NRS 62B.335) By granting the juvenile
19 court limited jurisdiction over a person who is 21 years of age or older who is
20 charged with the commission of a delinquent act that occurred when the person was
21 less than 18 years of age, section 1 requires the juvenile court to hold a hearing and
22 consider certain factors relating to the interests of justice and need for protection of

23 the public to determine whether the case of any such person should be dismissed or
24 transferred to the district court for criminal proceedings.
25 Section 2 of this bill makes the amendatory provisions of section 1 applicable
26 to offenses committed on or after October 1, 2013.
