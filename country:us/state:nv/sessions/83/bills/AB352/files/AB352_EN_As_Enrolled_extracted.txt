Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Under existing law, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs is required to adopt
regulations for the licensing of every person who manufactures, compounds,
processes or packages drugs, devices or cosmetics in this State. (NRS 585.245)

Section 2:
Section 20 of this bill exempts, with certain exceptions, cottage cosmetics
operations from the provisions of law governing the licensing, regulation, fees and
inspection of such persons by the Commissioner.

Section 3:
Section 4 of this bill defines the term “cottage cosmetics operation” to mean a
natural person: (1) who manufactures or prepares cosmetics in his or her private
home or in a kitchen that is not otherwise required by law to be inspected for the
preparation of a cosmetic, for sale to a natural person; and (2) whose gross sales of
such cosmetics are not more than $100,000 per year. Section 3 of this bill defines
the term “cosmetic.” Sections 5 and 6 of this bill define certain other terms relating
to cottage cosmetics operations. Section 2 of this bill applies these definitions to
the provisions of sections 2-11.5 of this bill.

Section 4:
Section 7 requires a person who wishes to conduct a cottage cosmetics
operation to apply to the State Department of Agriculture for a license to conduct a
cottage cosmetics operation and prescribes certain requirements for such an
application. Section 7 authorizes the Department to: (1) charge certain fees for the
issuance and renewal of a license to conduct a cottage cosmetics operation; and (2)
inspect a cottage cosmetics operation for certain purposes and charge a fee for the
inspection if the cottage cosmetics operation produced an adulterated or
misbranded cosmetic or was the source of an outbreak of illness caused by a
contaminated cosmetic. Section 7 also requires the Department to maintain a
registry of each person who holds an active license to conduct a cottage cosmetics
establishment. Section 10 requires the Director of the Department to adopt certain
regulations governing cottage cosmetics operations.

Section 5:
Section 11 of this bill authorizes the Director to impose a civil penalty of not
more than $500 for a violation of the provisions of sections 2-11.5. Section 21 of
this bill provides that the civil penalty is an exception to the criminal penalties
imposed for other violations of the provisions relating to food, drugs and cosmetics.

Section 6:
Section 11.5: (1) prohibits certain entities from adopting an ordinance or other
regulation that prohibits a natural person from operating a cottage cosmetics
operation; and (2) provides that the provisions of sections 2-11.5 do not prohibit
certain entities from regulating the time, place or manner of a cottage cosmetics
operation, provided that such regulations do not unreasonably restrict or prohibit a
person from conducting a cottage cosmetics operation.
Existing law sets forth certain requirements for a food establishment that
prepares food intended for human consumption. (NRS 446.0145-446.945) Existing
law exempts a cottage food operation from such requirements and requires a person
who wishes to conduct a cottage food operation to register with a certain health
authority. (NRS 446.866) Section 16 of this bill instead requires a person who
wishes to conduct a cottage food operation to apply to the Department for a license
to conduct a cottage food operation. Sections 14-16 of this bill revise and
reorganize the existing provisions governing cottage food operations into new

Section 7:
sections of the Nevada Revised Statutes. Section 28 of this bill repeals an existing
provision governing cottage food operations made redundant by section 16.

Section 8:
Section 14 revises the definition of “cottage food operation” to apply to a natural
person who manufactures or prepares food items in his or her private home or in a
kitchen that is not otherwise required by law to be inspected for the purposes of
preparing a food item, for sale and whose gross sales of such food items are not
more than $100,000 per calendar year. Section 15 revises the definition of “food
item” to include, certain food items.
Additionally, section 16 authorizes a cottage food operation to: (1) sell food
items via a transaction by telephone or via the Internet; and (2) fulfill a transaction
in person, by mail or through a food delivery service platform. Section 26 of this
bill makes a cottage food operation a “food dispensing establishment,” thereby
applying the provisions governing the food delivery service platforms to the
delivery of food items from a cottage food operation. Section 16 authorizes the
Department to charge certain fees for the issuance and renewal of a license to
conduct a cottage food operation. Section 16 further requires the Department to
maintain a registry of each person who holds an active license to conduct a cottage
food operation. Section 19 of this bill requires the Director of the Department to
adopt certain regulations governing cottage food operations.

Section 9:
Section 19.5 of this bill: (1) prohibits certain entities from adopting an
ordinance or other regulation that prohibits a person from preparing food in a
cottage operation; and (2) provides that the provisions of sections 12-19.5 do not
prohibit certain entities from regulating the time, place or manner of a cottage food
operation, provided that such regulations do not unreasonably restrict or prohibit a
person from conducting a cottage food operation.

Section 10:
Section 23 of this bill revises the definition of “food establishment” to reflect
the reorganization of provisions governing cottage food operations.
Existing federal law requires each state to adopt procedures to ensure that
applicants for certain licenses and certificates comply with child support
obligations. (42 U.S.C. § 666) Sections 8, 9, 17 and 18 enact such procedures as
applicable to an applicant for a license to conduct a cottage cosmetics operation and
an applicant for a license to conduct a cottage food operation in order to comply
with federal law.
Existing law provides that the penalty for a violation of any provision of
existing law relating to agricultural products and seeds is a civil penalty of not more
than $500 for each violation. (NRS 587.900) This penalty applies to sections 12-

Section 11:
19.5 of this bill.
Existing law exempts a farm from certain provisions governing food
establishments for the purposes of holding a farm-to-fork event under certain
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 3 –
conditions. (NRS 446.868) Section 24 of this bill authorizes a farm holding such an
event to serve certain food items provided that: (1) any livestock or game animal
that is served at the event is butchered and processed on the farm in accordance
with certain provisions of law or was inspected and approved under a certain
inspection program; and (2) certain other food items served at the farm-to-fork
event are sourced from certain facilities or was inspected and approved under a
certain inspection program. Section 24 also exempts: (1) a farm from certain
provisions governing food establishments provided that the farm holds four events
or less in a month; and (2) a farm that holds more than four events during a harvest
or holiday season from such provisions. Section 25 of this bill prohibits the
Department from charging a fee for the registration of a farm to hold farm-to-fork
events when the annual revenue of the farm for the preceding calendar year was
less than $100,000.
Existing law sets forth certain requirements for a craft food operation in which
a person manufactures or prepares acidified foods in certain kitchens and whose
gross sales of such foods are not more than $35,000 per calendar year and
authorizes the Department to adopt certain regulations governing such operations.
(NRS 587.691-587.699) Section 21.2 of this bill increases the amount of gross
sales that a craft food operation may have to not more than $100,000 per calendar
year.

Section 12:
Section 21.4 of this bill authorizes a craft food operation to sell acidified foods
in a transaction by telephone or via the Internet and requires that the sale be
fulfilled in person. Section 21.6 of this bill eliminates the requirements that an
acidified food be produced by a person who: (1) maintains a log and supporting
documentation concerning the canning date for each batch of acidified foods
produced by the person; and (2) uses only certain canning recipes. Section 21.8 of
this bill eliminates the authority of the Department to charge a fee to a person who
produces acidified food for a course of training and an examination.

Raw Text:
Assembly Bill No. 352–Assemblymember Anderson
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to businesses; requiring a person who wishes to
conduct a cottage cosmetics operation to apply to the State
Department of Agriculture for a license; setting forth
requirements and fees relating to a cottage cosmetics
operation; exempting a cottage cosmetics operation from
certain licensing requirements; revising and reorganizing
certain provisions governing cottage food establishments;
requiring a person who wishes to conduct a cottage food
operation to apply to the Department; revising
certain provisions governing craft food operations; revising
provisions governing farm-to-fork events; applying certain
provisions governing food delivery service platforms to the
delivery of food items from a cottage food operation;
providing a penalty; providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Under existing law, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs is required to adopt
regulations for the licensing of every person who manufactures, compounds,
processes or packages drugs, devices or cosmetics in this State. (NRS 585.245)
Section 20 of this bill exempts, with certain exceptions, cottage cosmetics
operations from the provisions of law governing the licensing, regulation, fees and
inspection of such persons by the Commissioner.
Section 4 of this bill defines the term “cottage cosmetics operation” to mean a
natural person: (1) who manufactures or prepares cosmetics in his or her private
home or in a kitchen that is not otherwise required by law to be inspected for the
preparation of a cosmetic, for sale to a natural person; and (2) whose gross sales of
such cosmetics are not more than $100,000 per year. Section 3 of this bill defines
the term “cosmetic.” Sections 5 and 6 of this bill define certain other terms relating
to cottage cosmetics operations. Section 2 of this bill applies these definitions to
the provisions of sections 2-11.5 of this bill.
Section 7 requires a person who wishes to conduct a cottage cosmetics
operation to apply to the State Department of Agriculture for a license to conduct a
cottage cosmetics operation and prescribes certain requirements for such an
application. Section 7 authorizes the Department to: (1) charge certain fees for the
issuance and renewal of a license to conduct a cottage cosmetics operation; and (2)
inspect a cottage cosmetics operation for certain purposes and charge a fee for the
inspection if the cottage cosmetics operation produced an adulterated or
misbranded cosmetic or was the source of an outbreak of illness caused by a
contaminated cosmetic. Section 7 also requires the Department to maintain a
registry of each person who holds an active license to conduct a cottage cosmetics
establishment. Section 10 requires the Director of the Department to adopt certain
regulations governing cottage cosmetics operations.
Section 11 of this bill authorizes the Director to impose a civil penalty of not
more than $500 for a violation of the provisions of sections 2-11.5. Section 21 of
this bill provides that the civil penalty is an exception to the criminal penalties
imposed for other violations of the provisions relating to food, drugs and cosmetics.
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 2 –
Section 11.5: (1) prohibits certain entities from adopting an ordinance or other
regulation that prohibits a natural person from operating a cottage cosmetics
operation; and (2) provides that the provisions of sections 2-11.5 do not prohibit
certain entities from regulating the time, place or manner of a cottage cosmetics
operation, provided that such regulations do not unreasonably restrict or prohibit a
person from conducting a cottage cosmetics operation.
Existing law sets forth certain requirements for a food establishment that
prepares food intended for human consumption. (NRS 446.0145-446.945) Existing
law exempts a cottage food operation from such requirements and requires a person
who wishes to conduct a cottage food operation to register with a certain health
authority. (NRS 446.866) Section 16 of this bill instead requires a person who
wishes to conduct a cottage food operation to apply to the Department for a license
to conduct a cottage food operation. Sections 14-16 of this bill revise and
reorganize the existing provisions governing cottage food operations into new
sections of the Nevada Revised Statutes. Section 28 of this bill repeals an existing
provision governing cottage food operations made redundant by section 16.
Section 14 revises the definition of “cottage food operation” to apply to a natural
person who manufactures or prepares food items in his or her private home or in a
kitchen that is not otherwise required by law to be inspected for the purposes of
preparing a food item, for sale and whose gross sales of such food items are not
more than $100,000 per calendar year. Section 15 revises the definition of “food
item” to include, certain food items.
Additionally, section 16 authorizes a cottage food operation to: (1) sell food
items via a transaction by telephone or via the Internet; and (2) fulfill a transaction
in person, by mail or through a food delivery service platform. Section 26 of this
bill makes a cottage food operation a “food dispensing establishment,” thereby
applying the provisions governing the food delivery service platforms to the
delivery of food items from a cottage food operation. Section 16 authorizes the
Department to charge certain fees for the issuance and renewal of a license to
conduct a cottage food operation. Section 16 further requires the Department to
maintain a registry of each person who holds an active license to conduct a cottage
food operation. Section 19 of this bill requires the Director of the Department to
adopt certain regulations governing cottage food operations.
Section 19.5 of this bill: (1) prohibits certain entities from adopting an
ordinance or other regulation that prohibits a person from preparing food in a
cottage operation; and (2) provides that the provisions of sections 12-19.5 do not
prohibit certain entities from regulating the time, place or manner of a cottage food
operation, provided that such regulations do not unreasonably restrict or prohibit a
person from conducting a cottage food operation.
Section 23 of this bill revises the definition of “food establishment” to reflect
the reorganization of provisions governing cottage food operations.
Existing federal law requires each state to adopt procedures to ensure that
applicants for certain licenses and certificates comply with child support
obligations. (42 U.S.C. § 666) Sections 8, 9, 17 and 18 enact such procedures as
applicable to an applicant for a license to conduct a cottage cosmetics operation and
an applicant for a license to conduct a cottage food operation in order to comply
with federal law.
Existing law provides that the penalty for a violation of any provision of
existing law relating to agricultural products and seeds is a civil penalty of not more
than $500 for each violation. (NRS 587.900) This penalty applies to sections 12-
19.5 of this bill.
Existing law exempts a farm from certain provisions governing food
establishments for the purposes of holding a farm-to-fork event under certain
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 3 –
conditions. (NRS 446.868) Section 24 of this bill authorizes a farm holding such an
event to serve certain food items provided that: (1) any livestock or game animal
that is served at the event is butchered and processed on the farm in accordance
with certain provisions of law or was inspected and approved under a certain
inspection program; and (2) certain other food items served at the farm-to-fork
event are sourced from certain facilities or was inspected and approved under a
certain inspection program. Section 24 also exempts: (1) a farm from certain
provisions governing food establishments provided that the farm holds four events
or less in a month; and (2) a farm that holds more than four events during a harvest
or holiday season from such provisions. Section 25 of this bill prohibits the
Department from charging a fee for the registration of a farm to hold farm-to-fork
events when the annual revenue of the farm for the preceding calendar year was
less than $100,000.
Existing law sets forth certain requirements for a craft food operation in which
a person manufactures or prepares acidified foods in certain kitchens and whose
gross sales of such foods are not more than $35,000 per calendar year and
authorizes the Department to adopt certain regulations governing such operations.
(NRS 587.691-587.699) Section 21.2 of this bill increases the amount of gross
sales that a craft food operation may have to not more than $100,000 per calendar
year.
Section 21.4 of this bill authorizes a craft food operation to sell acidified foods
in a transaction by telephone or via the Internet and requires that the sale be
fulfilled in person. Section 21.6 of this bill eliminates the requirements that an
acidified food be produced by a person who: (1) maintains a log and supporting
documentation concerning the canning date for each batch of acidified foods
produced by the person; and (2) uses only certain canning recipes. Section 21.8 of
this bill eliminates the authority of the Department to charge a fee to a person who
produces acidified food for a course of training and an examination.
