Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs is required to adopt
2 regulations for the licensing of every person who manufactures, compounds,
3 processes or packages drugs, devices or cosmetics in this State. (NRS 585.245)
4 Section 20 of this bill exempts, with certain exceptions, cottage cosmetics
5 operations from the provisions of law governing the licensing, regulation, fees and
6 inspection of such persons by the Commissioner.
7 Section 4 of this bill defines the term “cottage cosmetics operation” to mean a
8 natural person: (1) who manufactures or prepares cosmetics in his or her private
9 home or in a kitchen that is not otherwise required by law to be inspected for the
10 preparation of a cosmetic, for sale to a natural person; and (2) whose gross sales of
11 such cosmetics are not more than $100,000 per year. Section 3 of this bill defines
12 the term “cosmetic.” Sections 5 and 6 of this bill define certain other terms relating
-
*AB352*
– 2 –
13 to cottage cosmetics operations. Section 2 of this bill applies these definitions to
14 the provisions of sections 2-11 of this bill.
15 Section 7 requires a person who wishes to conduct a cottage cosmetics
16 operation to apply to the State Department of Agriculture for a license to conduct a
17 cottage cosmetics operation and prescribes certain requirements for such an
18 application. Section 7 authorizes the Department to: (1) charge certain fees for the
19 issuance and renewal of a license to conduct a cottage cosmetics operation; and (2)
20 inspect a cottage cosmetics operation for certain purposes and charge a fee for the
21 inspection if the cottage cosmetics operation produced an adulterated or
22 misbranded cosmetic or was the source of an outbreak of illness caused by a
23 contaminated cosmetic. Section 7 prohibits a local zoning board, planning
24 commission or governing body of an unincorporated town, incorporated city or
25 county to adopt an ordinance or other regulation that prohibits a person from
26 operating a cottage cosmetics operation. Additionally, section 7 requires the
27 Department to maintain a registry of each person who holds an active license to
28 conduct a cottage cosmetics establishment. Section 10 requires the Director of the
29 Department to adopt certain regulations governing cottage cosmetics operations.
30 Section 11 of this bill authorizes the Director to impose a civil penalty of not
31 more than $500 for a violation of the provisions of sections 2-11. Section 21 of this
32 bill provides that the civil penalty is an exception to the criminal penalties imposed
33 for other violations of the provisions relating to food, drugs and cosmetics.
34 Existing law sets forth certain requirements for a food establishment that
35 prepares food intended for human consumption. (NRS 446.0145-446.945) Existing
36 law exempts a cottage food operation from such requirements and requires a person
37 who wishes to conduct a cottage food operation to register with a certain health
38 authority. (NRS 446.866) Section 16 of this bill instead requires a person who
39 wishes to conduct a cottage food operation to apply to the Department for a license
40 to conduct a cottage food operation. Sections 14-16 of this bill revise and
41 reorganize the existing provisions governing cottage food operations into new
42 sections of the Nevada Revised Statutes. Section 28 of this bill repeals the existing
43 provisions governing cottage food operations. Section 14 revises the definition of
44 “cottage food operation” to apply to a natural person who manufactures or prepares
45 food items in his or her private home or in a kitchen that is not otherwise required
46 by law to be inspected for the purposes of preparing a food item, for sale and whose
47 gross sales of such food items are not more than $100,000 per calendar year.
48 Section 15 revises the definition of “food item” to include, among other food items,
49 certain acidified foods. Section 13 of this bill defines the term “acidified foods.”
50 Additionally, section 16 authorizes a cottage food operation to: (1) sell food
51 items via a transaction by telephone or via the Internet; and (2) fulfill a transaction
52 in person, by mail or through a food delivery service platform. Section 26 of this
53 bill makes a cottage food operation a “food dispensing establishment,” thereby
54 applying the provisions governing the food delivery service platforms to the
55 delivery of food items from a cottage food operation. Section 16 authorizes the
56 Department to charge certain fees for the issuance and renewal of a license to
57 conduct a cottage food operation. Section 16 further requires the Department to
58 maintain a registry of each person who holds an active license to conduct a cottage
59 food operation. Section 19 of this bill requires the Director of the Department to
60 adopt certain regulations governing cottage food operations.
61 Section 23 of this bill revises the definition of “food establishment” to reflect
62 the reorganization of provisions governing cottage food operations.
63 Existing federal law requires each state to adopt procedures to ensure that
64 applicants for certain licenses and certificates comply with child support
65 obligations. (42 U.S.C. § 666) Sections 8, 9, 17 and 18 of this bill enact such
66 procedures as applicable to an applicant for a license to conduct a cottage cosmetics
-
*AB352*
– 3 –
67 operation and an applicant for a license to conduct a cottage food operation in order
68 to comply with federal law.
69 Existing law provides that the penalty for a violation of any provision of
70 existing law relating to agricultural products and seeds is a civil penalty of not more
71 than $500 for each violation. (NRS 587.900) This penalty applies to sections 12-19
72 of this bill.
73 Existing law exempts a farm from certain provisions governing food
74 establishments for the purposes of holding a farm-to-fork event under certain
75 conditions. (NRS 446.868) Section 24 of this bill authorizes a farm holding such an
76 event to serve certain food items provided that: (1) any livestock or game animal
77 that is served at the event is butchered and processed on the farm in accordance
78 with certain provisions of law or was inspected and approved under a certain
79 inspection program; and (2) certain other food items served at the farm-to-fork
80 event are sourced from certain facilities or was inspected and approved under a
81 certain inspection program. Section 24 also exempts: (1) a farm from certain
82 provisions governing food establishments provided that the farm holds four events
83 or less in a month; and (2) a farm that holds more than four events during a harvest
84 or holiday season from such provisions. Section 25 of this bill prohibits the
85 Department from charging a fee for the registration of a farm to hold farm-to-fork
86 events when the annual revenue of the farm for the preceding calendar year was
87 less than $100,000.
88 Existing law sets forth certain requirements for a craft food operation in which
89 a person manufactures or prepares acidified foods in certain kitchens and whose
90 gross sales of such foods are not more than $35,000 per calendar year and
91 authorizes the Department to adopt certain regulations governing such operations.
92 (NRS 587.691-587.699) Section 28 repeals such provisions. Section 27 of this bill
93 declares void the regulations adopted by the Department governing craft food
94 operations and requires the Legislative Counsel to remove the regulations from the
95 Nevada Administrative Code.

(BDR 51-890)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to businesses; requiring a person who wishes to
conduct a cottage cosmetics operation to apply to the
State Department of Agriculture for a license; setting
forth requirements and fees relating to a cottage cosmetics
operation; exempting a cottage cosmetics operation from
certain licensing requirements; revising and reorganizing
certain provisions governing cottage food establishments;
requiring a person who wishes to conduct a cottage food
operation to apply to the Department; revising provisions
governing farm-to-fork events; applying certain
provisions governing food delivery service platforms to
the delivery of food items from a cottage food operation;
declaring void certain regulations; eliminating certain
provisions governing craft food operations; providing a
penalty; providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs is required to adopt
2 regulations for the licensing of every person who manufactures, compounds,
3 processes or packages drugs, devices or cosmetics in this State. (NRS 585.245)
4 Section 20 of this bill exempts, with certain exceptions, cottage cosmetics
5 operations from the provisions of law governing the licensing, regulation, fees and
6 inspection of such persons by the Commissioner.
7 Section 4 of this bill defines the term “cottage cosmetics operation” to mean a
8 natural person: (1) who manufactures or prepares cosmetics in his or her private
9 home or in a kitchen that is not otherwise required by law to be inspected for the
10 preparation of a cosmetic, for sale to a natural person; and (2) whose gross sales of
11 such cosmetics are not more than $100,000 per year. Section 3 of this bill defines
12 the term “cosmetic.” Sections 5 and 6 of this bill define certain other terms relating
-
*AB352*

– 2 –
13 to cottage cosmetics operations. Section 2 of this bill applies these definitions to
14 the provisions of sections 2-11 of this bill.
15 Section 7 requires a person who wishes to conduct a cottage cosmetics
16 operation to apply to the State Department of Agriculture for a license to conduct a
17 cottage cosmetics operation and prescribes certain requirements for such an
18 application. Section 7 authorizes the Department to: (1) charge certain fees for the
19 issuance and renewal of a license to conduct a cottage cosmetics operation; and (2)
20 inspect a cottage cosmetics operation for certain purposes and charge a fee for the
21 inspection if the cottage cosmetics operation produced an adulterated or
22 misbranded cosmetic or was the source of an outbreak of illness caused by a
23 contaminated cosmetic. Section 7 prohibits a local zoning board, planning
24 commission or governing body of an unincorporated town, incorporated city or
25 county to adopt an ordinance or other regulation that prohibits a person from
26 operating a cottage cosmetics operation. Additionally, section 7 requires the
27 Department to maintain a registry of each person who holds an active license to
28 conduct a cottage cosmetics establishment. Section 10 requires the Director of the
29 Department to adopt certain regulations governing cottage cosmetics operations.
30 Section 11 of this bill authorizes the Director to impose a civil penalty of not
31 more than $500 for a violation of the provisions of sections 2-11. Section 21 of this
32 bill provides that the civil penalty is an exception to the criminal penalties imposed
33 for other violations of the provisions relating to food, drugs and cosmetics.
34 Existing law sets forth certain requirements for a food establishment that
35 prepares food intended for human consumption. (NRS 446.0145-446.945) Existing
36 law exempts a cottage food operation from such requirements and requires a person
37 who wishes to conduct a cottage food operation to register with a certain health
38 authority. (NRS 446.866) Section 16 of this bill instead requires a person who
39 wishes to conduct a cottage food operation to apply to the Department for a license
40 to conduct a cottage food operation. Sections 14-16 of this bill revise and
41 reorganize the existing provisions governing cottage food operations into new
42 sections of the Nevada Revised Statutes. Section 28 of this bill repeals the existing
43 provisions governing cottage food operations. Section 14 revises the definition of
44 “cottage food operation” to apply to a natural person who manufactures or prepares
45 food items in his or her private home or in a kitchen that is not otherwise required
46 by law to be inspected for the purposes of preparing a food item, for sale and whose
47 gross sales of such food items are not more than $100,000 per calendar year.
48 Section 15 revises the definition of “food item” to include, among other food items,
49 certain acidified foods. Section 13 of this bill defines the term “acidified foods.”
50 Additionally, section 16 authorizes a cottage food operation to: (1) sell food
51 items via a transaction by telephone or via the Internet; and (2) fulfill a transaction
52 in person, by mail or through a food delivery service platform. Section 26 of this
53 bill makes a cottage food operation a “food dispensing establishment,” thereby
54 applying the provisions governing the food delivery service platforms to the
55 delivery of food items from a cottage food operation. Section 16 authorizes the
56 Department to charge certain fees for the issuance and renewal of a license to
57 conduct a cottage food operation. Section 16 further requires the Department to
58 maintain a registry of each person who holds an active license to conduct a cottage
59 food operation. Section 19 of this bill requires the Director of the Department to
60 adopt certain regulations governing cottage food operations.
61 Section 23 of this bill revises the definition of “food establishment” to reflect
62 the reorganization of provisions governing cottage food operations.
63 Existing federal law requires each state to adopt procedures to ensure that
64 applicants for certain licenses and certificates comply with child support
65 obligations. (42 U.S.C. § 666) Sections 8, 9, 17 and 18 of this bill enact such
66 procedures as applicable to an applicant for a license to conduct a cottage cosmetics
-
*AB352*

– 3 –
67 operation and an applicant for a license to conduct a cottage food operation in order
68 to comply with federal law.
69 Existing law provides that the penalty for a violation of any provision of
70 existing law relating to agricultural products and seeds is a civil penalty of not more
71 than $500 for each violation. (NRS 587.900) This penalty applies to sections 12-19
72 of this bill.
73 Existing law exempts a farm from certain provisions governing food
74 establishments for the purposes of holding a farm-to-fork event under certain
75 conditions. (NRS 446.868) Section 24 of this bill authorizes a farm holding such an
76 event to serve certain food items provided that: (1) any livestock or game animal
77 that is served at the event is butchered and processed on the farm in accordance
78 with certain provisions of law or was inspected and approved under a certain
79 inspection program; and (2) certain other food items served at the farm-to-fork
80 event are sourced from certain facilities or was inspected and approved under a
81 certain inspection program. Section 24 also exempts: (1) a farm from certain
82 provisions governing food establishments provided that the farm holds four events
83 or less in a month; and (2) a farm that holds more than four events during a harvest
84 or holiday season from such provisions. Section 25 of this bill prohibits the
85 Department from charging a fee for the registration of a farm to hold farm-to-fork
86 events when the annual revenue of the farm for the preceding calendar year was
87 less than $100,000.
88 Existing law sets forth certain requirements for a craft food operation in which
89 a person manufactures or prepares acidified foods in certain kitchens and whose
90 gross sales of such foods are not more than $35,000 per calendar year and
91 authorizes the Department to adopt certain regulations governing such operations.
92 (NRS 587.691-587.699) Section 28 repeals such provisions. Section 27 of this bill
93 declares void the regulations adopted by the Department governing craft food
94 operations and requires the Legislative Counsel to remove the regulations from the
95 Nevada Administrative Code.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 585 of NRS is hereby amended by adding
2 thereto the provisions set forth as sections 2 to 19, inclusive of this
