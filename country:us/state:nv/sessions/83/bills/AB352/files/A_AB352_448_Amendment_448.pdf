Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs is required to adopt regulations
2 for the licensing of every person who manufactures, compounds, processes or packages drugs,
3 devices or cosmetics in this State. (NRS 585.245) Section 20 of this bill exempts, with certain
4 exceptions, cottage cosmetics operations from the provisions of law governing the licensing,
5 regulation, fees and inspection of such persons by the Commissioner.
6 Section 4 of this bill defines the term “cottage cosmetics operation” to mean a natural
7 person: (1) who manufactures or prepares cosmetics in his or her private home or in a kitchen
8 that is not otherwise required by law to be inspected for the preparation of a cosmetic, for sale
9 to a natural person; and (2) whose gross sales of such cosmetics are not more than $100,000
10 per year. Section 3 of this bill defines the term “cosmetic.” Sections 5 and 6 of this bill define
11 certain other terms relating to cottage cosmetics operations. Section 2 of this bill applies these
12 definitions to the provisions of sections [2-11] 2-11.5 of this bill.
13 Section 7 requires a person who wishes to conduct a cottage cosmetics operation to apply
14 to the State Department of Agriculture for a license to conduct a cottage cosmetics operation
15 and prescribes certain requirements for such an application. Section 7 authorizes the
16 Department to: (1) charge certain fees for the issuance and renewal of a license to conduct a
17 cottage cosmetics operation; and (2) inspect a cottage cosmetics operation for certain purposes
18 and charge a fee for the inspection if the cottage cosmetics operation produced an adulterated
19 or misbranded cosmetic or was the source of an outbreak of illness caused by a contaminated

Assembly Amendment No. 448 to Assembly Bill No. 352 Page 4
20 cosmetic. Section 7 [prohibits a local zoning board, planning commission or governing body
21 of an unincorporated town, incorporated city or county to adopt an ordinance or other
22 regulation that prohibits a person from operating a cottage cosmetics operation. Additionally,
23 section 7] also requires the Department to maintain a registry of each person who holds an
24 active license to conduct a cottage cosmetics establishment. Section 10 requires the Director
25 of the Department to adopt certain regulations governing cottage cosmetics operations.
26 Section 11 of this bill authorizes the Director to impose a civil penalty of not more than
27 $500 for a violation of the provisions of sections [2-11.] 2-11.5. Section 21 of this bill
28 provides that the civil penalty is an exception to the criminal penalties imposed for other
29 violations of the provisions relating to food, drugs and cosmetics.
30 Section 11.5: (1) prohibits certain entities from adopting an ordinance or other
31 regulation that prohibits a natural person from operating a cottage cosmetics operation;
32 and (2) provides that the provisions of sections 2-11.5 do not prohibit certain entities
33 from regulating the time, place or manner of a cottage cosmetics operation, provided
34 that such regulations do not unreasonably restrict or prohibit a person from conducting
35 a cottage cosmetics operation.
36 Existing law sets forth certain requirements for a food establishment that prepares food
37 intended for human consumption. (NRS 446.0145-446.945) Existing law exempts a cottage
38 food operation from such requirements and requires a person who wishes to conduct a cottage
39 food operation to register with a certain health authority. (NRS 446.866) Section 16 of this
40 bill instead requires a person who wishes to conduct a cottage food operation to apply to the
41 Department for a license to conduct a cottage food operation. Sections 14-16 of this bill revise
42 and reorganize the existing provisions governing cottage food operations into new sections of
43 the Nevada Revised Statutes. Section 28 of this bill repeals [the] an existing [provisions]
44 provision governing cottage food operations [.] made redundant by section 16. Section 14
45 revises the definition of “cottage food operation” to apply to a natural person who
46 manufactures or prepares food items in his or her private home or in a kitchen that is not
47 otherwise required by law to be inspected for the purposes of preparing a food item, for sale
48 and whose gross sales of such food items are not more than $100,000 per calendar year.
49 Section 15 revises the definition of “food item” to include, [among other] certain food items .
50 [, certain acidified foods. Section 13 of this bill defines the term “acidified foods.”]
51 Additionally, section 16 authorizes a cottage food operation to: (1) sell food items via a
52 transaction by telephone or via the Internet; and (2) fulfill a transaction in person, by mail or
53 through a food delivery service platform. Section 26 of this bill makes a cottage food
54 operation a “food dispensing establishment,” thereby applying the provisions governing the
55 food delivery service platforms to the delivery of food items from a cottage food operation.
56 Section 16 authorizes the Department to charge certain fees for the issuance and renewal of a
57 license to conduct a cottage food operation. Section 16 further requires the Department to
58 maintain a registry of each person who holds an active license to conduct a cottage food
59 operation. Section 19 of this bill requires the Director of the Department to adopt certain
60 regulations governing cottage food operations.
61 Section 19.5 of this bill: (1) prohibits certain entities from adopting an ordinance or
62 other regulation that prohibits a person from preparing food in a cottage operation; and
63 (2) provides that the provisions of sections 12-19.5 do not prohibit certain entities from
64 regulating the time, place or manner of a cottage food operation, provided that such
65 regulations do not unreasonably restrict or prohibit a person from conducting a cottage
66 food operation.
67 Section 23 of this bill revises the definition of “food establishment” to reflect the
68 reorganization of provisions governing cottage food operations.
69 Existing federal law requires each state to adopt procedures to ensure that applicants for
70 certain licenses and certificates comply with child support obligations. (42 U.S.C. § 666)
71 Sections 8, 9, 17 and 18 [of this bill] enact such procedures as applicable to an applicant for a
72 license to conduct a cottage cosmetics operation and an applicant for a license to conduct a
73 cottage food operation in order to comply with federal law.
74 Existing law provides that the penalty for a violation of any provision of existing law
75 relating to agricultural products and seeds is a civil penalty of not more than $500 for each
76 violation. (NRS 587.900) This penalty applies to sections [12-19] 12-19.5 of this bill.
77 Existing law exempts a farm from certain provisions governing food establishments for
78 the purposes of holding a farm-to-fork event under certain conditions. (NRS 446.868) Section

Assembly Amendment No. 448 to Assembly Bill No. 352 Page 5
79 24 of this bill authorizes a farm holding such an event to serve certain food items provided
80 that: (1) any livestock or game animal that is served at the event is butchered and processed on
81 the farm in accordance with certain provisions of law or was inspected and approved under a
82 certain inspection program; and (2) certain other food items served at the farm-to-fork event
83 are sourced from certain facilities or was inspected and approved under a certain inspection
84 program. Section 24 also exempts: (1) a farm from certain provisions governing food
85 establishments provided that the farm holds four events or less in a month; and (2) a farm that
86 holds more than four events during a harvest or holiday season from such provisions. Section
87 25 of this bill prohibits the Department from charging a fee for the registration of a farm to
88 hold farm-to-fork events when the annual revenue of the farm for the preceding calendar year
89 was less than $100,000.
90 Existing law sets forth certain requirements for a craft food operation in which a person
91 manufactures or prepares acidified foods in certain kitchens and whose gross sales of such
92 foods are not more than $35,000 per calendar year and authorizes the Department to adopt
93 certain regulations governing such operations. (NRS 587.691-587.699) Section [28 repeals
94 such provisions. Section 27 of this bill declares void the regulations adopted by the
95 Department governing craft food operations and requires the Legislative Counsel to remove
96 the regulations from the Nevada Administrative Code.] 21.2 of this bill increases the amount
97 of gross sales that a craft food operation may have to not more than $100,000 per
98 calendar year.
99 Section 21.4 of this bill authorizes a craft food operation to sell acidified foods in a
100 transaction by telephone or via the Internet and requires that the sale be fulfilled in
101 person. Section 21.6 of this bill eliminates the requirements that an acidified food be
102 produced by a person who: (1) maintains a log and supporting documentation
103 concerning the canning date for each batch of acidified foods produced by the person;
104 and (2) uses only certain canning recipes. Section 21.8 of this bill eliminates the authority
105 of the Department to charge a fee to a person who produces acidified food for a course of
106 training and an examination.
