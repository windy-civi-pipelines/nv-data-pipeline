Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs is required to adopt regulations
2 for the licensing of every person who manufactures, compounds, processes or packages drugs,
3 devices or cosmetics in this State. (NRS 585.245) Section 20 of this bill exempts, with certain
4 exceptions, cottage cosmetics operations from the provisions of law governing the licensing,
5 regulation, fees and inspection of such persons by the Commissioner.
6 Section 4 of this bill defines the term “cottage cosmetics operation” to mean a natural
7 person: (1) who manufactures or prepares cosmetics in his or her private home or in a kitchen
8 that is not otherwise required by law to be inspected for the preparation of a cosmetic, for sale
9 to a natural person; and (2) whose gross sales of such cosmetics are not more than $100,000
10 per year. Section 3 of this bill defines the term “cosmetic.” Sections 5 and 6 of this bill define
11 certain other terms relating to cottage cosmetics operations. Section 2 of this bill applies these
12 definitions to the provisions of sections 2-11.5 of this bill.
13 Section 7 requires a person who wishes to conduct a cottage cosmetics operation to apply
14 to the State Department of Agriculture for a license to conduct a cottage cosmetics operation
15 and prescribes certain requirements for such an application. Section 7 authorizes the
16 Department to: (1) charge certain fees for the issuance and renewal of a license to conduct a
17 cottage cosmetics operation; and (2) inspect a cottage cosmetics operation for certain purposes
18 and charge a fee for the inspection if the cottage cosmetics operation produced an adulterated
19 or misbranded cosmetic or was the source of an outbreak of illness caused by a contaminated
20 cosmetic. Section 7 also requires the Department to maintain a registry of each person who
21 holds an active license to conduct a cottage cosmetics establishment. Section 10 requires the
Senate Amendment No. 924 to Assembly Bill No. 352 First Reprint Page 4
22 Director of the Department to adopt certain regulations governing cottage cosmetics
23 operations.
24 Section 11 of this bill authorizes the Director to impose a civil penalty of not more than
25 $500 for a violation of the provisions of sections 2-11.5. Section 21 of this bill provides that
26 the civil penalty is an exception to the criminal penalties imposed for other violations of the
27 provisions relating to food, drugs and cosmetics.
28 Section 11.5: (1) prohibits certain entities from adopting an ordinance or other regulation
29 that prohibits a natural person from operating a cottage cosmetics operation; and (2) provides
30 that the provisions of sections 2-11.5 do not prohibit certain entities from regulating the time,
31 place or manner of a cottage cosmetics operation, provided that such regulations do not
32 unreasonably restrict or prohibit a person from conducting a cottage cosmetics operation.
33 Existing law sets forth certain requirements for a food establishment that prepares food
34 intended for human consumption. (NRS 446.0145-446.945) Existing law exempts a cottage
35 food operation from such requirements and requires a person who wishes to conduct a cottage
36 food operation to register with a certain health authority. (NRS 446.866) Section 16 of this
37 bill instead requires a person who wishes to conduct a cottage food operation to apply to the
38 Department for a license to conduct a cottage food operation. Sections 14-16 of this bill revise
39 and reorganize the existing provisions governing cottage food operations into new sections of
40 the Nevada Revised Statutes. Section 28 of this bill repeals an existing provision governing
41 cottage food operations made redundant by section 16. Section 14 revises the definition of
42 “cottage food operation” to apply to a natural person who manufactures or prepares food items
43 in his or her private home or in a kitchen that is not otherwise required by law to be inspected
44 for the purposes of preparing a food item, for sale and whose gross sales of such food items
45 are not more than $100,000 per calendar year. Section 15 revises the definition of “food item”
46 to include, certain food items.
47 Additionally, section 16 authorizes a cottage food operation to: (1) sell food items via a
48 transaction by telephone or via the Internet; and (2) fulfill a transaction in person, by mail or
49 through a food delivery service platform. Section 26 of this bill makes a cottage food
50 operation a “food dispensing establishment,” thereby applying the provisions governing the
51 food delivery service platforms to the delivery of food items from a cottage food operation.
52 Section 16 authorizes the Department to charge certain fees for the issuance and renewal of a
53 license to conduct a cottage food operation. Section 16 further requires the Department to
54 maintain a registry of each person who holds an active license to conduct a cottage food
55 operation. Section 19 of this bill requires the Director of the Department to adopt certain
56 regulations governing cottage food operations.
57 Section 19.5 of this bill: (1) prohibits certain entities from adopting an ordinance or other
58 regulation that prohibits a person from preparing food in a cottage operation; and (2) provides
59 that the provisions of sections 12-19.5 do not prohibit certain entities from regulating the
60 time, place or manner of a cottage food operation, provided that such regulations do not
61 unreasonably restrict or prohibit a person from conducting a cottage food operation.
62 Section 23 of this bill revises the definition of “food establishment” to reflect the
63 reorganization of provisions governing cottage food operations.
64 Existing federal law requires each state to adopt procedures to ensure that applicants for
65 certain licenses and certificates comply with child support obligations. (42 U.S.C. § 666)
66 Sections 8, 9, 17 and 18 enact such procedures as applicable to an applicant for a license to
67 conduct a cottage cosmetics operation and an applicant for a license to conduct a cottage food
68 operation in order to comply with federal law.
69 Existing law provides that the penalty for a violation of any provision of existing law
70 relating to agricultural products and seeds is a civil penalty of not more than $500 for each
71 violation. (NRS 587.900) This penalty applies to sections 12-19.5 of this bill.
72 Existing law exempts a farm from certain provisions governing food establishments for
73 the purposes of holding a farm-to-fork event under certain conditions. (NRS 446.868) Section
74 24 of this bill authorizes a farm holding such an event to serve certain food items provided
75 that: (1) any livestock or game animal that is served at the event is butchered and processed on
76 the farm in accordance with certain provisions of law or was inspected and approved under a
77 certain inspection program; and (2) certain other food items served at the farm-to-fork event
78 are sourced from certain facilities or was inspected and approved under a certain inspection
79 program. Section 24 also exempts: (1) a farm from certain provisions governing food
80 establishments provided that the farm holds four events or less in a month; and (2) a farm that
Senate Amendment No. 924 to Assembly Bill No. 352 First Reprint Page 5
81 holds more than four events during a harvest or holiday season from such provisions. Section
82 25 of this bill prohibits the Department from charging a fee for the registration of a farm to
83 hold farm-to-fork events when the annual revenue of the farm for the preceding calendar year
84 was less than $100,000.
85 Existing law sets forth certain requirements for a craft food operation in which a person
86 manufactures or prepares acidified foods in certain kitchens and whose gross sales of such
87 foods are not more than $35,000 per calendar year and authorizes the Department to adopt
88 certain regulations governing such operations. (NRS 587.691-587.699) Section 21.2 of this
89 bill increases the amount of gross sales that a craft food operation may have to not more than
90 $100,000 per calendar year.
91 Section 21.4 of this bill authorizes a craft food operation to sell acidified foods in a
92 transaction by telephone or via the Internet and requires that the sale be fulfilled in person.
93 Section 21.6 of this bill eliminates the requirements that an acidified food be produced by a
94 person who: (1) maintains a log and supporting documentation concerning the canning date
95 for each batch of acidified foods produced by the person; and (2) uses only certain canning
96 recipes. Section 21.8 of this bill eliminates the authority of the Department to charge a fee to a
97 person who produces acidified food for a course of training and an examination.

AN ACT relating to businesses; requiring a person who wishes to conduct a cottage
cosmetics operation to apply to the State Department of Agriculture for
a license; setting forth requirements and fees relating to a cottage
cosmetics operation; exempting a cottage cosmetics operation from
certain licensing requirements; revising and reorganizing certain
provisions governing cottage food establishments; requiring a person
who wishes to conduct a cottage food operation to apply to the
Department; revising certain provisions governing craft food
operations; revising provisions governing farm-to-fork events;
applying certain provisions governing food delivery service platforms
to the delivery of food items from a cottage food operation; providing a
penalty; providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs is required to adopt regulations
2 for the licensing of every person who manufactures, compounds, processes or packages drugs,
3 devices or cosmetics in this State. (NRS 585.245) Section 20 of this bill exempts, with certain
4 exceptions, cottage cosmetics operations from the provisions of law governing the licensing,
5 regulation, fees and inspection of such persons by the Commissioner.
6 Section 4 of this bill defines the term “cottage cosmetics operation” to mean a natural
7 person: (1) who manufactures or prepares cosmetics in his or her private home or in a kitchen
8 that is not otherwise required by law to be inspected for the preparation of a cosmetic, for sale
9 to a natural person; and (2) whose gross sales of such cosmetics are not more than $100,000
10 per year. Section 3 of this bill defines the term “cosmetic.” Sections 5 and 6 of this bill define
11 certain other terms relating to cottage cosmetics operations. Section 2 of this bill applies these
12 definitions to the provisions of sections 2-11.5 of this bill.
13 Section 7 requires a person who wishes to conduct a cottage cosmetics operation to apply
14 to the State Department of Agriculture for a license to conduct a cottage cosmetics operation
15 and prescribes certain requirements for such an application. Section 7 authorizes the
16 Department to: (1) charge certain fees for the issuance and renewal of a license to conduct a
17 cottage cosmetics operation; and (2) inspect a cottage cosmetics operation for certain purposes
18 and charge a fee for the inspection if the cottage cosmetics operation produced an adulterated
19 or misbranded cosmetic or was the source of an outbreak of illness caused by a contaminated
20 cosmetic. Section 7 also requires the Department to maintain a registry of each person who
21 holds an active license to conduct a cottage cosmetics establishment. Section 10 requires the

Senate Amendment No. 924 to Assembly Bill No. 352 First Reprint Page 4
22 Director of the Department to adopt certain regulations governing cottage cosmetics
23 operations.
24 Section 11 of this bill authorizes the Director to impose a civil penalty of not more than
25 $500 for a violation of the provisions of sections 2-11.5. Section 21 of this bill provides that
26 the civil penalty is an exception to the criminal penalties imposed for other violations of the
27 provisions relating to food, drugs and cosmetics.
28 Section 11.5: (1) prohibits certain entities from adopting an ordinance or other regulation
29 that prohibits a natural person from operating a cottage cosmetics operation; and (2) provides
30 that the provisions of sections 2-11.5 do not prohibit certain entities from regulating the time,
31 place or manner of a cottage cosmetics operation, provided that such regulations do not
32 unreasonably restrict or prohibit a person from conducting a cottage cosmetics operation.
33 Existing law sets forth certain requirements for a food establishment that prepares food
34 intended for human consumption. (NRS 446.0145-446.945) Existing law exempts a cottage
35 food operation from such requirements and requires a person who wishes to conduct a cottage
36 food operation to register with a certain health authority. (NRS 446.866) Section 16 of this
37 bill instead requires a person who wishes to conduct a cottage food operation to apply to the
38 Department for a license to conduct a cottage food operation. Sections 14-16 of this bill revise
39 and reorganize the existing provisions governing cottage food operations into new sections of
40 the Nevada Revised Statutes. Section 28 of this bill repeals an existing provision governing
41 cottage food operations made redundant by section 16. Section 14 revises the definition of
42 “cottage food operation” to apply to a natural person who manufactures or prepares food items
43 in his or her private home or in a kitchen that is not otherwise required by law to be inspected
44 for the purposes of preparing a food item, for sale and whose gross sales of such food items
45 are not more than $100,000 per calendar year. Section 15 revises the definition of “food item”
46 to include, certain food items.
47 Additionally, section 16 authorizes a cottage food operation to: (1) sell food items via a
48 transaction by telephone or via the Internet; and (2) fulfill a transaction in person, by mail or
49 through a food delivery service platform. Section 26 of this bill makes a cottage food
50 operation a “food dispensing establishment,” thereby applying the provisions governing the
51 food delivery service platforms to the delivery of food items from a cottage food operation.
52 Section 16 authorizes the Department to charge certain fees for the issuance and renewal of a
53 license to conduct a cottage food operation. Section 16 further requires the Department to
54 maintain a registry of each person who holds an active license to conduct a cottage food
55 operation. Section 19 of this bill requires the Director of the Department to adopt certain
56 regulations governing cottage food operations.
57 Section 19.5 of this bill: (1) prohibits certain entities from adopting an ordinance or other
58 regulation that prohibits a person from preparing food in a cottage operation; and (2) provides
59 that the provisions of sections 12-19.5 do not prohibit certain entities from regulating the
60 time, place or manner of a cottage food operation, provided that such regulations do not
61 unreasonably restrict or prohibit a person from conducting a cottage food operation.
62 Section 23 of this bill revises the definition of “food establishment” to reflect the
63 reorganization of provisions governing cottage food operations.
64 Existing federal law requires each state to adopt procedures to ensure that applicants for
65 certain licenses and certificates comply with child support obligations. (42 U.S.C. § 666)
66 Sections 8, 9, 17 and 18 enact such procedures as applicable to an applicant for a license to
67 conduct a cottage cosmetics operation and an applicant for a license to conduct a cottage food
68 operation in order to comply with federal law.
69 Existing law provides that the penalty for a violation of any provision of existing law
70 relating to agricultural products and seeds is a civil penalty of not more than $500 for each
71 violation. (NRS 587.900) This penalty applies to sections 12-19.5 of this bill.
72 Existing law exempts a farm from certain provisions governing food establishments for
73 the purposes of holding a farm-to-fork event under certain conditions. (NRS 446.868) Section
74 24 of this bill authorizes a farm holding such an event to serve certain food items provided
75 that: (1) any livestock or game animal that is served at the event is butchered and processed on
76 the farm in accordance with certain provisions of law or was inspected and approved under a
77 certain inspection program; and (2) certain other food items served at the farm-to-fork event
78 are sourced from certain facilities or was inspected and approved under a certain inspection
79 program. Section 24 also exempts: (1) a farm from certain provisions governing food
80 establishments provided that the farm holds four events or less in a month; and (2) a farm that

Senate Amendment No. 924 to Assembly Bill No. 352 First Reprint Page 5
81 holds more than four events during a harvest or holiday season from such provisions. Section
82 25 of this bill prohibits the Department from charging a fee for the registration of a farm to
83 hold farm-to-fork events when the annual revenue of the farm for the preceding calendar year
84 was less than $100,000.
85 Existing law sets forth certain requirements for a craft food operation in which a person
86 manufactures or prepares acidified foods in certain kitchens and whose gross sales of such
87 foods are not more than $35,000 per calendar year and authorizes the Department to adopt
88 certain regulations governing such operations. (NRS 587.691-587.699) Section 21.2 of this
89 bill increases the amount of gross sales that a craft food operation may have to not more than
90 $100,000 per calendar year.
91 Section 21.4 of this bill authorizes a craft food operation to sell acidified foods in a
92 transaction by telephone or via the Internet and requires that the sale be fulfilled in person.
93 Section 21.6 of this bill eliminates the requirements that an acidified food be produced by a
94 person who: (1) maintains a log and supporting documentation concerning the canning date
95 for each batch of acidified foods produced by the person; and (2) uses only certain canning
96 recipes. Section 21.8 of this bill eliminates the authority of the Department to charge a fee to a
97 person who produces acidified food for a course of training and an examination.

16 illness known or suspected to be caused by an adulterated cosmetic. The cottage
17 cosmetics operation shall cooperate with the Department in any such inspection.

19 cosmetics operation has produced an adulterated or misbranded cosmetic or was

charitable or other nonprofit organization.
2. No local zoning board, planning commission or governing body of an
unincorporated town, incorporated city or county may adopt any ordinance or other
regulation that prohibits a natural person from preparing food in a cottage food
operation.
3. Each natural person who wishes to conduct a cottage food operation must,
before selling any food item, register the cottage food operation with the health
authority by submitting such information as the health authority deems appropriate,
including, without limitation:
(a) The name, address and contact information of the natural person conducting
the cottage food operation; and
(b) If the cottage food operation sells food items under a name other than the
name of the natural person who conducts the cottage food operation, the name
under which the cottage food operation sells food items.
4. The health authority may charge a fee for the registration of a cottage food
operation pursuant to subsection 3 in an amount not to exceed the actual cost of the
health authority to establish and maintain a registry of cottage food operations.
5. The health authority may inspect a cottage food operation only to
investigate a food item that may be deemed to be adulterated pursuant to NRS
585.300 to 585.360, inclusive, or an outbreak or suspected outbreak of illness
known or suspected to be caused by a contaminated food item. The cottage food
operation shall cooperate with the health authority in any such inspection. If, as a
result of such inspection, the health authority determines that the cottage food
operation has produced an adulterated food item or was the source of an outbreak of
illness caused by a contaminated food item, the health authority may charge and
collect from the cottage food operation a fee in an amount that does not exceed the
actual cost of the health authority to conduct the investigation.
