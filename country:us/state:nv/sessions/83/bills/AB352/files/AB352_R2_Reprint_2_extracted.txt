Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs is required to adopt
2 regulations for the licensing of every person who manufactures, compounds,
3 processes or packages drugs, devices or cosmetics in this State. (NRS 585.245)
4 Section 20 of this bill exempts, with certain exceptions, cottage cosmetics
5 operations from the provisions of law governing the licensing, regulation, fees and
6 inspection of such persons by the Commissioner.
7 Section 4 of this bill defines the term “cottage cosmetics operation” to mean a
8 natural person: (1) who manufactures or prepares cosmetics in his or her private
9 home or in a kitchen that is not otherwise required by law to be inspected for the
10 preparation of a cosmetic, for sale to a natural person; and (2) whose gross sales of
11 such cosmetics are not more than $100,000 per year. Section 3 of this bill defines
-
*AB352_R2*
– 2 –
12 the term “cosmetic.” Sections 5 and 6 of this bill define certain other terms relating
13 to cottage cosmetics operations. Section 2 of this bill applies these definitions to
14 the provisions of sections 2-11.5 of this bill.
15 Section 7 requires a person who wishes to conduct a cottage cosmetics
16 operation to apply to the State Department of Agriculture for a license to conduct a
17 cottage cosmetics operation and prescribes certain requirements for such an
18 application. Section 7 authorizes the Department to: (1) charge certain fees for the
19 issuance and renewal of a license to conduct a cottage cosmetics operation; and (2)
20 inspect a cottage cosmetics operation for certain purposes and charge a fee for the
21 inspection if the cottage cosmetics operation produced an adulterated or
22 misbranded cosmetic or was the source of an outbreak of illness caused by a
23 contaminated cosmetic. Section 7 also requires the Department to maintain a
24 registry of each person who holds an active license to conduct a cottage cosmetics
25 establishment. Section 10 requires the Director of the Department to adopt certain
26 regulations governing cottage cosmetics operations.
27 Section 11 of this bill authorizes the Director to impose a civil penalty of not
28 more than $500 for a violation of the provisions of sections 2-11.5. Section 21 of
29 this bill provides that the civil penalty is an exception to the criminal penalties
30 imposed for other violations of the provisions relating to food, drugs and cosmetics.
31 Section 11.5: (1) prohibits certain entities from adopting an ordinance or other
32 regulation that prohibits a natural person from operating a cottage cosmetics
33 operation; and (2) provides that the provisions of sections 2-11.5 do not prohibit
34 certain entities from regulating the time, place or manner of a cottage cosmetics
35 operation, provided that such regulations do not unreasonably restrict or prohibit a
36 person from conducting a cottage cosmetics operation.
37 Existing law sets forth certain requirements for a food establishment that
38 prepares food intended for human consumption. (NRS 446.0145-446.945) Existing
39 law exempts a cottage food operation from such requirements and requires a person
40 who wishes to conduct a cottage food operation to register with a certain health
41 authority. (NRS 446.866) Section 16 of this bill instead requires a person who
42 wishes to conduct a cottage food operation to apply to the Department for a license
43 to conduct a cottage food operation. Sections 14-16 of this bill revise and
44 reorganize the existing provisions governing cottage food operations into new
45 sections of the Nevada Revised Statutes. Section 28 of this bill repeals an existing
46 provision governing cottage food operations made redundant by section 16.
47 Section 14 revises the definition of “cottage food operation” to apply to a natural
48 person who manufactures or prepares food items in his or her private home or in a
49 kitchen that is not otherwise required by law to be inspected for the purposes of
50 preparing a food item, for sale and whose gross sales of such food items are not
51 more than $100,000 per calendar year. Section 15 revises the definition of “food
52 item” to include, certain food items.
53 Additionally, section 16 authorizes a cottage food operation to: (1) sell food
54 items via a transaction by telephone or via the Internet; and (2) fulfill a transaction
55 in person, by mail or through a food delivery service platform. Section 26 of this
56 bill makes a cottage food operation a “food dispensing establishment,” thereby
57 applying the provisions governing the food delivery service platforms to the
58 delivery of food items from a cottage food operation. Section 16 authorizes the
59 Department to charge certain fees for the issuance and renewal of a license to
60 conduct a cottage food operation. Section 16 further requires the Department to
61 maintain a registry of each person who holds an active license to conduct a cottage
62 food operation. Section 19 of this bill requires the Director of the Department to
63 adopt certain regulations governing cottage food operations.
64 Section 19.5 of this bill: (1) prohibits certain entities from adopting an
65 ordinance or other regulation that prohibits a person from preparing food in a
66 cottage operation; and (2) provides that the provisions of sections 12-19.5 do not
-
*AB352_R2*
– 3 –
67 prohibit certain entities from regulating the time, place or manner of a cottage food
68 operation, provided that such regulations do not unreasonably restrict or prohibit a
69 person from conducting a cottage food operation.
70 Section 23 of this bill revises the definition of “food establishment” to reflect
71 the reorganization of provisions governing cottage food operations.
72 Existing federal law requires each state to adopt procedures to ensure that
73 applicants for certain licenses and certificates comply with child support
74 obligations. (42 U.S.C. § 666) Sections 8, 9, 17 and 18 enact such procedures as
75 applicable to an applicant for a license to conduct a cottage cosmetics operation and
76 an applicant for a license to conduct a cottage food operation in order to comply
77 with federal law.
78 Existing law provides that the penalty for a violation of any provision of
79 existing law relating to agricultural products and seeds is a civil penalty of not more
80 than $500 for each violation. (NRS 587.900) This penalty applies to sections 12-
81 19.5 of this bill.
82 Existing law exempts a farm from certain provisions governing food
83 establishments for the purposes of holding a farm-to-fork event under certain
84 conditions. (NRS 446.868) Section 24 of this bill authorizes a farm holding such an
85 event to serve certain food items provided that: (1) any livestock or game animal
86 that is served at the event is butchered and processed on the farm in accordance
87 with certain provisions of law or was inspected and approved under a certain
88 inspection program; and (2) certain other food items served at the farm-to-fork
89 event are sourced from certain facilities or was inspected and approved under a
90 certain inspection program. Section 24 also exempts: (1) a farm from certain
91 provisions governing food establishments provided that the farm holds four events
92 or less in a month; and (2) a farm that holds more than four events during a harvest
93 or holiday season from such provisions. Section 25 of this bill prohibits the
94 Department from charging a fee for the registration of a farm to hold farm-to-fork
95 events when the annual revenue of the farm for the preceding calendar year was
96 less than $100,000.
97 Existing law sets forth certain requirements for a craft food operation in which
98 a person manufactures or prepares acidified foods in certain kitchens and whose
99 gross sales of such foods are not more than $35,000 per calendar year and
100 authorizes the Department to adopt certain regulations governing such operations.
101 (NRS 587.691-587.699) Section 21.2 of this bill increases the amount of gross
102 sales that a craft food operation may have to not more than $100,000 per calendar
103 year.
104 Section 21.4 of this bill authorizes a craft food operation to sell acidified foods
105 in a transaction by telephone or via the Internet and requires that the sale be
106 fulfilled in person. Section 21.6 of this bill eliminates the requirements that an
107 acidified food be produced by a person who: (1) maintains a log and supporting
108 documentation concerning the canning date for each batch of acidified foods
109 produced by the person; and (2) uses only certain canning recipes. Section 21.8 of
110 this bill eliminates the authority of the Department to charge a fee to a person who
111 produces acidified food for a course of training and an examination.

~

State Department of Agriculture for a license; setting
forth requirements and fees relating to a cottage cosmetics

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs is required to adopt
2 regulations for the licensing of every person who manufactures, compounds,
3 processes or packages drugs, devices or cosmetics in this State. (NRS 585.245)
4 Section 20 of this bill exempts, with certain exceptions, cottage cosmetics
5 operations from the provisions of law governing the licensing, regulation, fees and
6 inspection of such persons by the Commissioner.
7 Section 4 of this bill defines the term “cottage cosmetics operation” to mean a
8 natural person: (1) who manufactures or prepares cosmetics in his or her private
9 home or in a kitchen that is not otherwise required by law to be inspected for the
10 preparation of a cosmetic, for sale to a natural person; and (2) whose gross sales of
11 such cosmetics are not more than $100,000 per year. Section 3 of this bill defines
-
*AB352_R2*

– 2 –
12 the term “cosmetic.” Sections 5 and 6 of this bill define certain other terms relating
13 to cottage cosmetics operations. Section 2 of this bill applies these definitions to
14 the provisions of sections 2-11.5 of this bill.
15 Section 7 requires a person who wishes to conduct a cottage cosmetics
16 operation to apply to the State Department of Agriculture for a license to conduct a
17 cottage cosmetics operation and prescribes certain requirements for such an
18 application. Section 7 authorizes the Department to: (1) charge certain fees for the
19 issuance and renewal of a license to conduct a cottage cosmetics operation; and (2)
20 inspect a cottage cosmetics operation for certain purposes and charge a fee for the
21 inspection if the cottage cosmetics operation produced an adulterated or
22 misbranded cosmetic or was the source of an outbreak of illness caused by a
23 contaminated cosmetic. Section 7 also requires the Department to maintain a
24 registry of each person who holds an active license to conduct a cottage cosmetics
25 establishment. Section 10 requires the Director of the Department to adopt certain
26 regulations governing cottage cosmetics operations.
27 Section 11 of this bill authorizes the Director to impose a civil penalty of not
28 more than $500 for a violation of the provisions of sections 2-11.5. Section 21 of
29 this bill provides that the civil penalty is an exception to the criminal penalties
30 imposed for other violations of the provisions relating to food, drugs and cosmetics.
31 Section 11.5: (1) prohibits certain entities from adopting an ordinance or other
32 regulation that prohibits a natural person from operating a cottage cosmetics
33 operation; and (2) provides that the provisions of sections 2-11.5 do not prohibit
34 certain entities from regulating the time, place or manner of a cottage cosmetics
35 operation, provided that such regulations do not unreasonably restrict or prohibit a
36 person from conducting a cottage cosmetics operation.
37 Existing law sets forth certain requirements for a food establishment that
38 prepares food intended for human consumption. (NRS 446.0145-446.945) Existing
39 law exempts a cottage food operation from such requirements and requires a person
40 who wishes to conduct a cottage food operation to register with a certain health
41 authority. (NRS 446.866) Section 16 of this bill instead requires a person who
42 wishes to conduct a cottage food operation to apply to the Department for a license
43 to conduct a cottage food operation. Sections 14-16 of this bill revise and
44 reorganize the existing provisions governing cottage food operations into new
45 sections of the Nevada Revised Statutes. Section 28 of this bill repeals an existing
46 provision governing cottage food operations made redundant by section 16.
47 Section 14 revises the definition of “cottage food operation” to apply to a natural
48 person who manufactures or prepares food items in his or her private home or in a
49 kitchen that is not otherwise required by law to be inspected for the purposes of
50 preparing a food item, for sale and whose gross sales of such food items are not
51 more than $100,000 per calendar year. Section 15 revises the definition of “food
52 item” to include, certain food items.
53 Additionally, section 16 authorizes a cottage food operation to: (1) sell food
54 items via a transaction by telephone or via the Internet; and (2) fulfill a transaction
55 in person, by mail or through a food delivery service platform. Section 26 of this
56 bill makes a cottage food operation a “food dispensing establishment,” thereby
57 applying the provisions governing the food delivery service platforms to the
58 delivery of food items from a cottage food operation. Section 16 authorizes the
59 Department to charge certain fees for the issuance and renewal of a license to
60 conduct a cottage food operation. Section 16 further requires the Department to
61 maintain a registry of each person who holds an active license to conduct a cottage
62 food operation. Section 19 of this bill requires the Director of the Department to
63 adopt certain regulations governing cottage food operations.
64 Section 19.5 of this bill: (1) prohibits certain entities from adopting an
65 ordinance or other regulation that prohibits a person from preparing food in a
66 cottage operation; and (2) provides that the provisions of sections 12-19.5 do not
-
*AB352_R2*

– 3 –
67 prohibit certain entities from regulating the time, place or manner of a cottage food
68 operation, provided that such regulations do not unreasonably restrict or prohibit a
69 person from conducting a cottage food operation.
70 Section 23 of this bill revises the definition of “food establishment” to reflect
71 the reorganization of provisions governing cottage food operations.
72 Existing federal law requires each state to adopt procedures to ensure that
73 applicants for certain licenses and certificates comply with child support
74 obligations. (42 U.S.C. § 666) Sections 8, 9, 17 and 18 enact such procedures as
75 applicable to an applicant for a license to conduct a cottage cosmetics operation and
76 an applicant for a license to conduct a cottage food operation in order to comply
77 with federal law.
78 Existing law provides that the penalty for a violation of any provision of
79 existing law relating to agricultural products and seeds is a civil penalty of not more
80 than $500 for each violation. (NRS 587.900) This penalty applies to sections 12-
81 19.5 of this bill.
82 Existing law exempts a farm from certain provisions governing food
83 establishments for the purposes of holding a farm-to-fork event under certain
84 conditions. (NRS 446.868) Section 24 of this bill authorizes a farm holding such an
85 event to serve certain food items provided that: (1) any livestock or game animal
86 that is served at the event is butchered and processed on the farm in accordance
87 with certain provisions of law or was inspected and approved under a certain
88 inspection program; and (2) certain other food items served at the farm-to-fork
89 event are sourced from certain facilities or was inspected and approved under a
90 certain inspection program. Section 24 also exempts: (1) a farm from certain
91 provisions governing food establishments provided that the farm holds four events
92 or less in a month; and (2) a farm that holds more than four events during a harvest
93 or holiday season from such provisions. Section 25 of this bill prohibits the
94 Department from charging a fee for the registration of a farm to hold farm-to-fork
95 events when the annual revenue of the farm for the preceding calendar year was
96 less than $100,000.
97 Existing law sets forth certain requirements for a craft food operation in which
98 a person manufactures or prepares acidified foods in certain kitchens and whose
99 gross sales of such foods are not more than $35,000 per calendar year and
100 authorizes the Department to adopt certain regulations governing such operations.
101 (NRS 587.691-587.699) Section 21.2 of this bill increases the amount of gross
102 sales that a craft food operation may have to not more than $100,000 per calendar
103 year.
104 Section 21.4 of this bill authorizes a craft food operation to sell acidified foods
105 in a transaction by telephone or via the Internet and requires that the sale be
106 fulfilled in person. Section 21.6 of this bill eliminates the requirements that an
107 acidified food be produced by a person who: (1) maintains a log and supporting
108 documentation concerning the canning date for each batch of acidified foods
109 produced by the person; and (2) uses only certain canning recipes. Section 21.8 of
110 this bill eliminates the authority of the Department to charge a fee to a person who
111 produces acidified food for a course of training and an examination.

2. No local zoning board, planning commission or governing
body of an unincorporated town, incorporated city or county may
adopt any ordinance or other regulation that prohibits a natural

5. The health authority may inspect a cottage food operation
only to investigate a food item that may be deemed to be adulterated
pursuant to NRS 585.300 to 585.360, inclusive, or an outbreak or
suspected outbreak of illness known or suspected to be caused by a
contaminated food item. The cottage food operation shall cooperate
with the health authority in any such inspection. If, as a result of
such inspection, the health authority determines that the cottage
food operation has produced an adulterated food item or was the
source of an outbreak of illness caused by a contaminated food item,

operation a fee in an amount that does not exceed the actual cost of
the health authority to conduct the investigation.
