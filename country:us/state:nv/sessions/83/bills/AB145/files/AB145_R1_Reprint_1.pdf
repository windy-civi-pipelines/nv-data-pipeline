AN ACT relating to veterans; prohibiting, with certain exceptions, a
person from providing certain services related to veterans’
benefits under certain circumstances; requiring the
Division of Human Resource Management of the
Department of Administration to develop certain
programs for the hiring and mentoring of veterans;
requiring the Administrator of the Division to employ a
Veterans Coordinator; revising the persons who are
eligible to receive, free of charge, an annual permit for

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing federal law prohibits a person from acting as an agent or attorney in
2 the preparation, presentation or prosecution of certain claims relating to benefits
3 provided to veterans and certain family members of veterans, unless the person has
4 been recognized or accredited by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs.
5 (38 U.S.C. § 5901; 38 C.F.R. § 14.629(b)) Section 1 of this bill prohibits a person
6 from preparing, presenting, prosecuting, advising, consulting or assisting any other
7 person with a claim before the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, the
-

– 2 –
8 United States Department of Defense or the Nevada Department of Veterans
9 Services in violation of federal law, unless the person has received such recognition
10 or accreditation. Additionally, section 1 provides that this prohibition does not: (1)
11 prohibit a person from performing such actions, provided that the person does not
12 request or accept any payment or donation; and (2) apply to the extent preempted
13 by federal law. Section 2 of this bill makes the civil penalty for a violation of
14 existing law governing services for veterans’ benefits apply to a person who
15 violates section 1. Sections 2 and 10 of this bill authorize a person who is
16 aggrieved by a violation of section 1 to bring an action for consumer fraud.
17 Section 11 of this bill requires the Administrator of the Division of Human
18 Resource Management of the Department of Administration to employ a Veterans
19 Coordinator and requires the Veterans Coordinator to supervise the veteran hiring
20 program and the peer mentor program established in sections 8 and 9 of this bill,
21 respectively. Section 7 of this bill defines the term Veterans Coordinator for the
22 purposes of sections 5-9 of this bill.
23 Section 8 requires the Division of Human Resource Management, under the
24 supervision of the Veterans Coordinator, to establish a veteran hiring program to
25 support the recruitment and retention of employees who are veterans or the spouses
26 of veterans or servicemembers. Section 8 further establishes certain requirements
27 for the program and requires the Veterans Coordinator to provide to the Interagency
28 Council on Veterans Affairs an annual report regarding the progress of the veteran
29 hiring program.
30 In 2019, the Governor established by executive order a peer mentor program
31 for veterans. The executive order required the Division of Human Resource
32 Management, under the supervision of the Veterans Coordinator, to develop a peer
33 mentor program for certain veterans. The executive order further required each
34 state agency that employs a veteran to identify one employee to serve as a peer
35 mentor. Additionally, the Veterans Coordinator is required to provide an annual
36 report regarding the progress of the peer mentor program to the Interagency
37 Council on Veterans Affairs. (Executive Order 2019-05 (3-20-2019)) Section 9
38 codifies the requirements for the peer mentor program in statute.
39 Existing law requires the Administrator of the Division of State Parks of the
40 State Department of Conservation and Natural Resources to establish a program to
41 issue, free of charge, an annual permit to enter all state parks and recreational areas
42 in this State to any bona fide resident of this State who has been discharged, except
43 a person who has been dishonorably discharged, from the Armed Forces of the
44 United States. (NRS 407.0655) Section 12 of this bill requires the program to
45 include the issuance of such annual permits to the widow, widower, parent or adult
46 child of a person killed in the line of duty while serving on active duty in the
47 Armed Forces of the United States.
