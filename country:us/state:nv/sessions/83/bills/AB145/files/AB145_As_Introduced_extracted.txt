AN ACT relating to veterans; prohibiting a person from providing

circumstances; prohibiting the Director of the Department
of Veterans Services from charging a fee for the interment
of the spouse of a veteran; requiring the Division of

the persons who are eligible to receive, free of charge, an

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing federal law prohibits a person from acting as an agent or attorney in
2 the preparation, presentation or prosecution of certain claims relating to benefits
3 provided to veterans and certain family members of veterans, unless the person has
4 been recognized or accredited by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs.
5 (38 U.S.C. § 5901; 38 C.F.R. § 14.629(b)) Section 1 of this bill prohibits a person
6 from preparing, presenting, prosecuting, advising, consulting or assisting any other
7 person with a claim before the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, the
8 United States Department of Defense or the Nevada Department of Veterans
9 Services in violation of federal law, unless the person has received such recognition

10 or accreditation. Section 2 of this bill makes the civil penalty for a violation of
11 existing law governing services for veterans’ benefits apply to a person who
12 violates section 1. Sections 2 and 10 of this bill authorize a person who is
13 aggrieved by a violation of section 1 to bring an action for consumer fraud.
14 Existing law requires the Director of the Department of Veterans Services to
15 establish, operate and maintain veterans’ cemeteries in this State. (NRS 417.090)
16 Existing law further requires the Director to charge a fee for the interment of a
17 family member of a veteran who is eligible for interment in a veterans’ cemetery in
18 this State. (NRS 417.210) Section 3 of this bill prohibits the Director from charging
19 a fee for the interment of the spouse of a veteran.
20 Section 11 of this bill requires the Administrator of the Division of Human
21 Resource Management of the Department of Administration to employ a Veterans
22 Coordinator and requires the Veterans Coordinator to supervise the veteran hiring
23 program and the peer mentor program established in sections 8 and 9 of this bill,
24 respectively. Section 7 of this bill defines the term Veterans Coordinator for the
25 purposes of sections 5-9 of this bill.
26 Section 8 requires the Division of Human Resource Management, under the
27 supervision of the Veterans Coordinator, to establish a veteran hiring program to
28 support the recruitment and retention of employees who are veterans or the spouses
29 of veterans or servicemembers. Section 8 further establishes certain requirements
30 for the program and requires the Veterans Coordinator to provide to the Interagency
31 Council on Veterans Affairs an annual report regarding the progress of the veteran
32 hiring program.
33 In 2019, the Governor established by executive order a peer mentor program
34 for veterans. The executive order required the Division of Human Resource
35 Management, under the supervision of the Veterans Coordinator, to develop a peer
36 mentor program for certain veterans. The executive order further required each
37 state agency that employs a veteran to identify one employee to serve as a peer
38 mentor. Additionally, the Veterans Coordinator is required to provide an annual
39 report regarding the progress of the peer mentor program to the Interagency
40 Council on Veterans Affairs. (Executive Order 2019-05 (3-20-2019)) Section 9
41 codifies the requirements for the peer mentor program in statute.
42 Existing law requires the Administrator of the Division of State Parks of the
43 State Department of Conservation and Natural Resources to establish a program to
44 issue, free of charge, an annual permit to enter all state parks and recreational areas
45 in this State to any bona fide resident of this State who has been discharged, except
46 a person who has been dishonorably discharged, from the Armed Forces of the
47 United States. (NRS 407.0655) Section 12 of this bill requires the program to
48 include the issuance of such annual permits to the widow, widower, parent or adult
49 child of a person killed in the line of duty while serving on active duty in the
50 Armed Forces of the United States.
