EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to veterans; prohibiting , with certain exceptions, a person from
providing certain services related to veterans’ benefits under certain
circumstances; [prohibiting the Director of the Department of Veterans
Services from charging a fee for the interment of the spouse of a
veteran;] requiring the Division of Human Resource Management of
the Department of Administration to develop certain programs for the
hiring and mentoring of veterans; requiring the Administrator of the
Division to employ a Veterans Coordinator; revising the persons who
are eligible to receive, free of charge, an annual permit for entering all
state parks and recreational areas to include the family members of
certain veterans; providing a penalty; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing federal law prohibits a person from acting as an agent or attorney in the
2 preparation, presentation or prosecution of certain claims relating to benefits provided to
3 veterans and certain family members of veterans, unless the person has been recognized or
4 accredited by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. (38 U.S.C. § 5901; 38 C.F.R.
5 § 14.629(b)) Section 1 of this bill prohibits a person from preparing, presenting, prosecuting,
6 advising, consulting or assisting any other person with a claim before the United States
7 Department of Veterans Affairs, the United States Department of Defense or the Nevada
8 Department of Veterans Services in violation of federal law, unless the person has received
9 such recognition or accreditation. Additionally, section 1 provides that this prohibition
10 does not: (1) prohibit a person from performing such actions, provided that the person
11 does not request or accept any payment or donation; and (2) apply to the extent
12 preempted by federal law. Section 2 of this bill makes the civil penalty for a violation of
13 existing law governing services for veterans’ benefits apply to a person who violates section
14 1. Sections 2 and 10 of this bill authorize a person who is aggrieved by a violation of section
15 1 to bring an action for consumer fraud.

Assembly Amendment No. 70 to Assembly Bill No. 145 Page 4
16 [Existing law requires the Director of the Department of Veterans Services to establish,
17 operate and maintain veterans’ cemeteries in this State. (NRS 417.090) Existing law further
18 requires the Director to charge a fee for the interment of a family member of a veteran who is
19 eligible for interment in a veterans’ cemetery in this State. (NRS 417.210) Section 3 of this
20 bill prohibits the Director from charging a fee for the interment of the spouse of a veteran.]
21 Section 11 of this bill requires the Administrator of the Division of Human Resource
22 Management of the Department of Administration to employ a Veterans Coordinator and
23 requires the Veterans Coordinator to supervise the veteran hiring program and the peer mentor
24 program established in sections 8 and 9 of this bill, respectively. Section 7 of this bill defines
25 the term Veterans Coordinator for the purposes of sections 5-9 of this bill.
26 Section 8 requires the Division of Human Resource Management, under the supervision
27 of the Veterans Coordinator, to establish a veteran hiring program to support the recruitment
28 and retention of employees who are veterans or the spouses of veterans or servicemembers.
29 Section 8 further establishes certain requirements for the program and requires the Veterans
30 Coordinator to provide to the Interagency Council on Veterans Affairs an annual report
31 regarding the progress of the veteran hiring program.
32 In 2019, the Governor established by executive order a peer mentor program for veterans.
33 The executive order required the Division of Human Resource Management, under the
34 supervision of the Veterans Coordinator, to develop a peer mentor program for certain
35 veterans. The executive order further required each state agency that employs a veteran to
36 identify one employee to serve as a peer mentor. Additionally, the Veterans Coordinator is
37 required to provide an annual report regarding the progress of the peer mentor program to the
38 Interagency Council on Veterans Affairs. (Executive Order 2019-05 (3-20-2019)) Section 9
39 codifies the requirements for the peer mentor program in statute.
40 Existing law requires the Administrator of the Division of State Parks of the State
41 Department of Conservation and Natural Resources to establish a program to issue, free of
42 charge, an annual permit to enter all state parks and recreational areas in this State to any bona
43 fide resident of this State who has been discharged, except a person who has been
44 dishonorably discharged, from the Armed Forces of the United States. (NRS 407.0655)
45 Section 12 of this bill requires the program to include the issuance of such annual permits to
46 the widow, widower, parent or adult child of a person killed in the line of duty while serving
47 on active duty in the Armed Forces of the United States.
