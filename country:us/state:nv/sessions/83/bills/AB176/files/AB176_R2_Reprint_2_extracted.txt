SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to contraception and
family planning services. (BDR 40-177)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; prohibiting certain governmental
entities from substantially burdening certain activity
relating to contraception and family planning services
under certain circumstances; authorizing a person whose
engagement in such activity has been so burdened to
assert the violation as a claim or defense in a judicial
proceeding; authorizing a court to award damages against
a governmental entity that substantially burdens such
activity in certain circumstances; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prescribes certain rights for a patient of a medical facility or a
2 facility for the dependent. (NRS 449A.100-449A.124) Sections 2-8 of this bill
3 establish the Right to Contraception and Family Planning Services Act. Sections
4 3.5-5 define certain terms for purposes of the Act. Section 3 establishes the
5 applicability of those definitions. Section 7 applies the provisions of the Act to
6 certain state laws and local laws and ordinances and the implementation of those
7 laws and ordinances, regardless of when those laws or ordinances were enacted.
8 Section 7 also ensures that the provisions of the Act do not apply to: (1) state and
9 local laws and ordinances relating to abortion; and (2) certain regulations and
10 policies of certain entities that regulate education and activities that take place at or
11 are sponsored by a public school. Section 8 generally prohibits a governmental
12 entity from enacting or implementing any limitation or requirement that singles out
13 contraception and family planning services and substantially burdens: (1) the access
14 of a person to contraception and family planning services, drugs or devices related
15 to contraception and family planning services or information related to
16 contraception and family planning services; or (2) the ability of a provider of health
17 care to provide contraception and family planning services, drugs or devices related
18 to contraception and family planning services or information related to
-

– 2 –
19 contraception and family planning services within his or her scope of practice,
20 training and experience. Section 8 creates an exception to such prohibitions if the
21 governmental entity demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the
22 burden, as applied to the person or provider of health care who is subject to
23 the burden: (1) furthers a compelling interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means
24 of furthering that interest. Section 8 authorizes a person whose ability to obtain or
25 provide contraception and family planning services, drugs or devices related to
26 contraception and family planning services or information related to contraception
27 and family planning services is burdened to bring or defend an action in court and
28 obtain appropriate relief. Section 8 requires a court to award costs and attorney’s
29 fees to a person who prevails on such a claim.
