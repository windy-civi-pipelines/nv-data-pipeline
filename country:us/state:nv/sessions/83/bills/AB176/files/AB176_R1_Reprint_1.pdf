EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; prohibiting certain governmental
entities from substantially burdening certain activity
relating to reproductive health care under certain
circumstances; authorizing a person whose engagement in
such activity has been so burdened to assert the violation
as a claim or defense in a judicial proceeding; authorizing
a court to award damages against a governmental entity
that substantially burdens such activity in certain
circumstances; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prescribes certain rights for a patient of a medical facility or a
2 facility for the dependent. (NRS 449A.100-449A.124) Sections 2-8 of this bill
3 establish the Right to Contraception and Family Planning Services Act. Sections 4-
4 6 define certain terms for purposes of the Act. Section 3 establishes the
5 applicability of those definitions. Section 7 applies the provisions of the Act to
6 certain state laws and local laws and ordinances and the implementation of those
7 laws and ordinances, regardless of when those laws or ordinances were enacted.
8 Section 7 also ensures that the provisions of the Act do not apply to: (1) state and
9 local laws and ordinances relating to abortion; and (2) certain regulations and
10 policies of certain entities that regulate education and activities that take place at or
11 are sponsored by a public school. Section 8 generally prohibits a governmental
12 entity from enacting or implementing any limitation or requirement that singles out
13 reproductive health care and substantially burdens: (1) the access of a person to
14 reproductive health care, drugs or devices related to reproductive health care or
15 information related to reproductive health care; or (2) the ability of a provider of
16 health care to provide reproductive health care, drugs or devices related to
17 reproductive health care or information related to reproductive health care within
18 his or her scope of practice, training and experience. Section 8 creates an exception

19 to such prohibitions if the governmental entity demonstrates by clear and
20 convincing evidence that the burden, as applied to the person or provider of health
21 care who is subject to the burden: (1) furthers a compelling interest; and (2) is the
22 least restrictive means of furthering that interest. Section 8 authorizes a person
23 whose ability to obtain or provide reproductive health care, drugs or devices related
24 to reproductive health care or information related to reproductive health care is
25 burdened to bring or defend an action in court and obtain appropriate relief. Section
26 8 requires a court to award costs and attorney’s fees to a person who prevails on
27 such a claim.
