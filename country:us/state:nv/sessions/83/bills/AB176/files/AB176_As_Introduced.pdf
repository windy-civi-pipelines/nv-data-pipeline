EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; prohibiting a governmental entity
from substantially burdening certain activity relating to
reproductive health care under certain circumstances;
authorizing a person whose engagement in such activity
has been so burdened to assert the violation as a claim or
defense in a judicial proceeding; authorizing a court to
award damages against a governmental entity that
substantially burdens such activity in certain
circumstances; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prescribes certain rights for a patient of a medical facility or a
2 facility for the dependent. (NRS 449A.100-449A.124) Sections 2-8 of this bill
3 establish the Right to Reproductive Health Care Act. Sections 4-6 define certain
4 terms for purposes of the Act. Section 3 establishes the applicability of those
5 definitions. Section 7 applies the provisions of the Act to certain state laws and all
6 local laws and ordinances and the implementation of those laws and ordinances,
7 regardless of when those laws or ordinances were enacted. Section 8 generally
8 prohibits a governmental entity from enacting or implementing any limitation or
9 requirement that singles out reproductive health care and substantially burdens: (1)
10 the access of a person to reproductive health care, drugs or devices related to
11 reproductive health care or information related to reproductive health care; or (2)
12 the ability of a provider of health care to provide reproductive health care, drugs or
13 devices related to reproductive health care or information related to reproductive
14 health care within his or her scope of practice, training and experience. Section 8
15 creates an exception to such prohibitions if the governmental entity demonstrates
16 by clear and convincing evidence that the burden, as applied to the person or
17 provider of health care who is subject to the burden: (1) furthers a compelling
18 interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that interest. Section 8

– 2 –
19 authorizes a person whose ability to obtain or provide reproductive health care,
20 drugs or devices related to reproductive health care or information related to
21 reproductive health care is burdened to bring or defend an action in court and
22 obtain appropriate relief. Section 8 requires a court to award costs and attorney’s
23 fees to a person who prevails on such a claim.
