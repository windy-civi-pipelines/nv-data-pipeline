EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; prohibiting certain governmental entities from
substantially burdening certain activity relating to [reproductive health
care] contraception and family planning services under certain
circumstances; authorizing a person whose engagement in such activity
has been so burdened to assert the violation as a claim or defense in a
judicial proceeding; authorizing a court to award damages against a
governmental entity that substantially burdens such activity in certain
circumstances; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prescribes certain rights for a patient of a medical facility or a facility for the
2 dependent. (NRS 449A.100-449A.124) Sections 2-8 of this bill establish the Right to
3 Contraception and Family Planning Services Act. Sections [4-6] 3.5-5 define certain terms for
4 purposes of the Act. Section 3 establishes the applicability of those definitions. Section 7
5 applies the provisions of the Act to certain state laws and local laws and ordinances and the
6 implementation of those laws and ordinances, regardless of when those laws or ordinances
7 were enacted. Section 7 also ensures that the provisions of the Act do not apply to: (1) state
8 and local laws and ordinances relating to abortion; and (2) certain regulations and policies of
9 certain entities that regulate education and activities that take place at or are sponsored by a
10 public school. Section 8 generally prohibits a governmental entity from enacting or
11 implementing any limitation or requirement that singles out [reproductive health care]
12 contraception and family planning services and substantially burdens: (1) the access of a
13 person to [reproductive health care,] contraception and family planning services, drugs or
14 devices related to [reproductive health care] contraception and family planning services or
15 information related to [reproductive health care;] contraception and family planning
16 services; or (2) the ability of a provider of health care to provide [reproductive health care,]
17 contraception and family planning services, drugs or devices related to [reproductive health
18 care] contraception and family planning services or information related to [reproductive
19 health care] contraception and family planning services within his or her scope of practice,
20 training and experience. Section 8 creates an exception to such prohibitions if the
21 governmental entity demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the burden, as
22 applied to the person or provider of health care who is subject to the burden: (1) furthers a
23 compelling interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that interest. Section 8
24 authorizes a person whose ability to obtain or provide [reproductive health care,]
25 contraception and family planning services, drugs or devices related to [reproductive health

Senate Amendment No. 636 to Assembly Bill No. 176 First Reprint Page 4
26 care] contraception and family planning services or information related to [reproductive
27 health care] contraception and family planning services is burdened to bring or defend an
28 action in court and obtain appropriate relief. Section 8 requires a court to award costs and
29 attorney’s fees to a person who prevails on such a claim.
