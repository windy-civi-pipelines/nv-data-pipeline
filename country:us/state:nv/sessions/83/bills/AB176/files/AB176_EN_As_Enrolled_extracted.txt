Section 1:
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to health care; prohibiting certain governmental
entities from substantially burdening certain activity relating
to contraception and family planning services under certain
circumstances; authorizing a person whose engagement in
such activity has been so burdened to assert the violation as a
claim or defense in a judicial proceeding; authorizing a court
to award damages against a governmental entity that
substantially burdens such activity in certain circumstances;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law prescribes certain rights for a patient of a medical facility or a
facility for the dependent. (NRS 449A.100-449A.124) Sections 2-8 of this bill
establish the Right to Contraception and Family Planning Services Act. Sections

Section 2:
3.5-5 define certain terms for purposes of the Act. Section 3 establishes the
applicability of those definitions. Section 7 applies the provisions of the Act to
certain state laws and local laws and ordinances and the implementation of those
laws and ordinances, regardless of when those laws or ordinances were enacted.

Section 3:
Section 7 also ensures that the provisions of the Act do not apply to: (1) state and
local laws and ordinances relating to abortion; and (2) certain regulations and
policies of certain entities that regulate education and activities that take place at or
are sponsored by a public school. Section 8 generally prohibits a governmental
entity from enacting or implementing any limitation or requirement that singles out
contraception and family planning services and substantially burdens: (1) the access
of a person to contraception and family planning services, drugs or devices related
to contraception and family planning services or information related to
contraception and family planning services; or (2) the ability of a provider of health
care to provide contraception and family planning services, drugs or devices related
to contraception and family planning services or information related to
contraception and family planning services within his or her scope of practice,
training and experience. Section 8 creates an exception to such prohibitions if the
governmental entity demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the
burden, as applied to the person or provider of health care who is subject to
the burden: (1) furthers a compelling interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means
of furthering that interest. Section 8 authorizes a person whose ability to obtain or
provide contraception and family planning services, drugs or devices related to
contraception and family planning services or information related to contraception
and family planning services is burdened to bring or defend an action in court and
obtain appropriate relief. Section 8 requires a court to award costs and attorney’s
fees to a person who prevails on such a claim.
