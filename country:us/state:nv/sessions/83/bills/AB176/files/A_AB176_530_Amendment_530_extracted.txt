SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to reproductive health care.

FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; prohibiting [a] certain governmental [entity]
entities from substantially burdening certain activity relating to
reproductive health care under certain circumstances; authorizing a
person whose engagement in such activity has been so burdened to
assert the violation as a claim or defense in a judicial proceeding;
authorizing a court to award damages against a governmental entity
that substantially burdens such activity in certain circumstances; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prescribes certain rights for a patient of a medical facility or a facility for the
2 dependent. (NRS 449A.100-449A.124) Sections 2-8 of this bill establish the Right to
3 [Reproductive Health Care] Contraception and Family Planning Services Act. Sections 4-6
4 define certain terms for purposes of the Act. Section 3 establishes the applicability of those
5 definitions. Section 7 applies the provisions of the Act to certain state laws and [all] local
6 laws and ordinances and the implementation of those laws and ordinances, regardless of when
7 those laws or ordinances were enacted. Section 7 also ensures that the provisions of the Act
8 do not apply to: (1) state and local laws and ordinances relating to abortion; and (2)
9 certain regulations and policies of certain entities that regulate education and activities
10 that take place at or are sponsored by a public school. Section 8 generally prohibits a
11 governmental entity from enacting or implementing any limitation or requirement that singles
12 out reproductive health care and substantially burdens: (1) the access of a person to
13 reproductive health care, drugs or devices related to reproductive health care or information
14 related to reproductive health care; or (2) the ability of a provider of health care to provide
15 reproductive health care, drugs or devices related to reproductive health care or information
16 related to reproductive health care within his or her scope of practice, training and experience.
17 Section 8 creates an exception to such prohibitions if the governmental entity demonstrates by
18 clear and convincing evidence that the burden, as applied to the person or provider of health
19 care who is subject to the burden: (1) furthers a compelling interest; and (2) is the least
20 restrictive means of furthering that interest. Section 8 authorizes a person whose ability to
21 obtain or provide reproductive health care, drugs or devices related to reproductive health care
22 or information related to reproductive health care is burdened to bring or defend an action in
23 court and obtain appropriate relief. Section 8 requires a court to award costs and attorney’s
24 fees to a person who prevails on such a claim.
