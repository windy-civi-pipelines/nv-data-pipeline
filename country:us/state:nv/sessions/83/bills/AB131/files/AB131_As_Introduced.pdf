AN ACT relating to housing; requiring the governing body of
certain counties and cities to adopt an ordinance to
authorize the owner of certain historic residential
properties to add an accessory dwelling unit to the
property; setting forth certain requirements for the
ordinance; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Section 1 of this bill requires the governing body of a county whose population
2 is 100,000 or more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties) or the governing body
3 of a city whose population is 60,000 or more (currently the Cities of Las Vegas,
4 Henderson, North Las Vegas, Reno and Sparks) to adopt an ordinance that
5 authorizes the owner of any historic residential property to apply to add an
6 accessory dwelling unit to the historic residential property. Section 1 further
7 requires such ordinance to: (1) set forth an expedited process for the approval of the
8 application and any appeal of the denial of such an application; (2) require that an
9 accessory dwelling unit that is added to a historic residential property meet all
10 applicable building codes, housing codes and any other codes regulating the health
11 or safety of occupants of real property; (3) require that the owner of an accessory
12 dwelling unit that is added to a historic residential property pursuant to the
13 ordinance use the accessory dwelling unit for family members or long-term rental
14 housing; and (4) prohibit the owner of the accessory dwelling unit from renting the
15 accessory dwelling unit as transient lodging or any other short-term housing or
16 from accepting for the payment of rent for the unit any financial assistance received
17 under the Housing Choice Voucher Program, commonly known as “section 8
18 vouchers.” For purposes of section 1, a “historic residential property” means a
19 property: (1) that is located in an area of the county or city, as applicable, zoned for
-

– 2 –
20 single-family residential use; (2) that is not located within a common-interest
21 community; and (3) on which there is an existing single-family residential unit that
22 is at least 50 years old.
23 Existing law authorizes the governing body of a county or city to divide the
24 county, city or region into zoning districts of such number, shape and area as are
25 best suited to carry out certain purposes. Within a zoning district, the governing
26 body may regulate and restrict the erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration,
27 repair or use of buildings, structures or land. (NRS 278.250) Section 4 of this bill
28 creates an exception to account for the requirement that the governing body of
29 certain counties and cities adopt an ordinance to allow the addition of an accessory
30 dwelling unit to a historic residential property pursuant to section 1.
31 Existing law requires that an action or proceeding seeking judicial relief or
32 review from or with respect to any final action, decision or order of any governing
33 body of a county or city be commenced within 25 days after the date of filing of
34 notice of the final action, decision or order with the clerk or secretary of the
35 governing body. (NRS 278.0235) Section 3 of this bill applies these provisions to
36 section 1.
37 Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to apply the definitions of
38 certain terms relating to planning and zoning to section 1.
