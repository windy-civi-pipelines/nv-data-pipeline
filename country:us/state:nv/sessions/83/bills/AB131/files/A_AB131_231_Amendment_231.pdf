property taxation for accessory dwelling [unit to the property; setting
forth certain requirements for the ordinance;] units rented or leased to

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 [Section 1 of this bill requires the governing body of a county whose population is
2 100,000 or more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties) or the governing body of a city
3 whose population is 60,000 or more (currently the Cities of Las Vegas, Henderson, North Las
4 Vegas, Reno and Sparks) to adopt an ordinance that authorizes the owner of any historic
5 residential property to apply to add an accessory dwelling unit to the historic residential
6 property. Section 1 further requires such ordinance to: (1) set forth an expedited process for
7 the approval of the application and any appeal of the denial of such an application; (2) require
8 that an accessory dwelling unit that is added to a historic residential property meet all
9 applicable building codes, housing codes and any other codes regulating the health or safety
10 of occupants of real property; (3) require that the owner of an accessory dwelling unit that is
11 added to a historic residential property pursuant to the ordinance use the accessory dwelling
12 unit for family members or long-term rental housing; and (4) prohibit the owner of the
13 accessory dwelling unit from renting the accessory dwelling unit as transient lodging or any
14 other short-term housing or from accepting for the payment of rent for the unit any financial
15 assistance received under the Housing Choice Voucher Program, commonly known as
16 “section 8 vouchers.” For purposes of section 1, a “historic residential property” means a
17 property: (1) that is located in an area of the county or city, as applicable, zoned for single-
18 family residential use; (2) that is not located within a common-interest community; and (3) on
19 which there is an existing single-family residential unit that is at least 50 years old.
20 Existing law authorizes the governing body of a county or city to divide the county, city
21 or region into zoning districts of such number, shape and area as are best suited to carry out
22 certain purposes. Within a zoning district, the governing body may regulate and restrict the

Assembly Amendment No. 231 to Assembly Bill No. 131 Page 4
23 erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair or use of buildings, structures or land.
24 (NRS 278.250) Section 4 of this bill creates an exception to account for the requirement that
25 the governing body of certain counties and cities adopt an ordinance to allow the addition of
26 an accessory dwelling unit to a historic residential property pursuant to section 1.
27 Existing law requires that an action or proceeding seeking judicial relief or review from
28 or with respect to any final action, decision or order of any governing body of a county or city
29 be commenced within 25 days after the date of filing of notice of the final action, decision or
30 order with the clerk or secretary of the governing body. (NRS 278.0235) Section 3 of this bill
31 applies these provisions to section 1.
32 Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to apply the definitions of certain terms
33 relating to planning and zoning to section 1.] Existing federal law authorizes the Secretary
34 of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development to provide
35 assistance to public housing agencies for tenant-based assistance through the Housing
36 Choice Voucher Program. (Section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937, 42 U.S.C.
37 § 1437f) Section 6 of this bill provides an exemption from property taxes for an
38 accessory dwelling unit if the accessory dwelling unit: (1) is rented or leased to a tenant
39 receiving assistance under the Program pursuant to a lease which is for a period of not
40 less than 12 consecutive months; (2) is located on the same parcel as a single-family
41 residence which is the primary residence of the owner of the accessory dwelling unit; (3)
42 complies with all applicable local zoning laws; and (4) if the parcel is located within a
43 common-interest community, complies with all applicable covenants, conditions and
44 restrictions of the community. Section 6 requires a person claiming the exemption to
45 annually file with the county assessor: (1) certain verifications from the appropriate
46 public housing authority; and (2) a copy of the lease. Section 6 also: (1) prohibits the
47 exemption from being granted for more than one accessory dwelling unit per parcel; and
48 (2) requires the county assessor to determine the value of the accessory dwelling unit
49 based on the cost of replacing the accessory dwelling unit. Section 7 of this bill makes a
50 conforming change to indicate the proper placement of section 6 in the Nevada Revised
51 Statutes.

13 outside the State of Nevada, whether specified when transportation begins or
14 afterward.
15  Such property is deemed to have acquired no situs in Nevada for purposes of
16 taxation. Such property is not deprived of exemption because while in the

29 exemption on the provision of services to the public by the State or a local
30 government that would otherwise receive revenue from the tax from which the
31 exemption would be granted; and
32 2. Will not impair adversely the ability of the State or a local government
33 to pay, when due, all interest and principal on any outstanding bonds or any
34 other obligations for which revenue from the tax from which the exemption
35 would be granted was pledged.
36 Sec. 9. 1. This section becomes effective upon passage and approval.
37 2. Sections 1 to 8, inclusive, of this act become effective:
38 (a) Upon passage and approval for the purpose of adopting any
39 regulations and performing any other preparatory administrative tasks that
40 are necessary to carry out the provisions of this act; and
41 (b) On July 1, 2026, for all other purposes.
