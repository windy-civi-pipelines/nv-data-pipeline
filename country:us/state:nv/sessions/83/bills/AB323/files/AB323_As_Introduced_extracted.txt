Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 When the board of trustees of a school district proposes to change the location
2 of a school, close a school or change the use of a school building to a purpose other
3 than the teaching of kindergarten through 12th grade, existing law requires the
4 board of trustees to: (1) give 30 days’ written notice to the principals and teachers
5 of the affected school and to the parents of the children attending the school; and
6 (2) publish a notice of the subject, time and place of the meeting at which the
7 matter will be considered. (NRS 393.080) Section 1 of this bill exempts from those
8 requirements a proposal to add prekindergarten to the grades that are taught at a
9 school. Section 1 also: (1) requires the board of trustees to notify members of the
10 community who reside within 1 mile of a school for which a change of location,
11 closure or change of use is proposed; and (2) prescribes the required contents of the
12 notice of a proposal to close a school that the board of trustees is required to
13 provide to parents, teachers and the community. Section 1 additionally prohibits the
14 board of trustees from basing a decision to close a school on: (1) any damage or
-
*AB323*
– 2 –
15 other impact to the school caused by a flood or fire; or (2) the number of pupils
16 enrolled in the school.
17 Existing law authorizes a resident of a school district who is aggrieved by a
18 decision of the board of trustees of a school district to close or change the use of a
19 school to make a written request to the board for a hearing for reconsideration of
20 the decision. (NRS 393.085) Section 2 of this bill: (1) requires the State Board of
21 Education to review a final decision of the board of trustees to close or change the
22 use of a school, regardless of whether the board of trustees holds such a
23 reconsideration hearing; and (2) prescribes the process for such review.
