AN ACT relating to public employees; revising certain deadlines
relating to the negotiation, mediation and arbitration of
collective bargaining agreements with the Executive
Department of the State Government; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, certain groups of employees in the classified service of the
2 Executive Department of State Government are authorized to engage in collective
3 bargaining with the Executive Department concerning wages, hours and other terms
4 and conditions of employment for such employees. (NRS 288.400-288.630) In
5 general, a collective bargaining agreement for such a group of employees must
6 begin on July 1 of an odd-numbered year and must end on June 30 of the next odd-
7 numbered year. (NRS 288.550)
8 Under existing law, the Governor is required to designate a representative to
9 conduct negotiations concerning collective bargaining agreements on behalf of the
10 Executive Department and negotiations between the representative of the Executive
11 Department and the exclusive representative of a bargaining unit are required to
12 begin within 60 days after one party notifies the other party of the desire to
13 negotiate or on or before October 1 of each even-numbered year, whichever is
14 earlier. (NRS 288.565) Section 1 of this bill requires such negotiations to begin on
15 or before June 1, rather than October 1, of each even-numbered year.
16 Under existing law, either the representative of the Executive Department or
17 the exclusive representative of a bargaining unit are authorized to request a
18 mediator if the parties do not reach a collective bargaining agreement within 120
19 days after beginning negotiations or on or before February 1 of an odd-numbered
20 year, whichever is earlier, unless the parties agree to a later date. (NRS 288.570)
21 Section 2 of this bill authorizes parties who do not reach an agreement to request a
22 mediator 120 days after beginning negotiations or on or before October 1, rather
23 than February 1.

24 Under existing law, if the representative of the Executive Department and the
25 exclusive representative of a bargaining unit do not reach a collective bargaining
26 agreement through mediation within 10 days after the appointment of a mediator,
27 mediation is required to cease and the parties are required to begin arbitration
28 proceedings on or before February 15 unless the parties agree to a later date. The
29 arbitrator is then required to render a decision on or before March 5. (NRS
30 288.575) Section 3 of this bill: (1) requires arbitration proceedings to begin on or
31 before October 15, rather than February 15; and (2) requires the arbitrator to render
32 a decision on or before November 5, rather than March 5. Section 3 also eliminates
33 the authority for the parties to agree to a later deadline for the decision of the
34 arbitrator.
