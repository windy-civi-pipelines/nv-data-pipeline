AN ACT relating to public employees; requiring the Governor to
include certain information relating to collective
bargaining agreements in the biennial proposed executive
budget; revising certain deadlines relating to the
negotiation, mediation and arbitration of collective
bargaining agreements with the Executive Department of
the State Government; making appropriations; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, the Governor may, notwithstanding the provisions of any
2 collective bargaining agreement, include in the biennial proposed executive budget
3 of the State any amount of money the Governor deems appropriate for salaries,
4 wage rates or any other form of direct monetary compensation for employees.
5 (NRS 288.510) Section 1 of this bill requires the Governor, to the extent
6 practicable, to include in the biennial proposed executive budget, any amount of
7 money to be paid as agreed upon in a collective bargaining agreement. Section 1
8 also requires that if the Governor determines it is impracticable to include such
9 money in the biennial proposed executive budget, he or she must submit a report
10 stating the reason for such a determination to the Legislature on the same day the
11 budget is submitted.
12 Under existing law, certain groups of employees in the classified service of the
13 Executive Department of State Government are authorized to engage in collective
14 bargaining with the Executive Department concerning wages, hours and other terms
15 and conditions of employment for such employees. (NRS 288.400-288.630) In
16 general, a collective bargaining agreement for such a group of employees must
17 begin on July 1 of an odd-numbered year and must end on June 30 of the next odd-
18 numbered year. (NRS 288.550)
19 Under existing law, the Governor is required to designate a representative to
20 conduct negotiations concerning collective bargaining agreements on behalf of the
-
*AB356_R2*

– 2 –
21 Executive Department and negotiations between the representative of the Executive
22 Department and the exclusive representative of a bargaining unit are required to
23 begin within 60 days after one party notifies the other party of the desire to
24 negotiate or on or before October 1 of each even-numbered year, whichever is
25 earlier. (NRS 288.565) Section 1.5 of this bill requires such negotiations to begin:
26 (1) on or before April 1, rather than October 1, of each even-numbered year; and
27 (2) within 60 days after an exclusive representative is designated for an
28 unrepresented bargaining unit.
29 Under existing law, either the representative of the Executive Department or
30 the exclusive representative of a bargaining unit are authorized to request a
31 mediator if the parties do not reach a collective bargaining agreement within 120
32 days after beginning negotiations or on or before February 1 of an odd-numbered
33 year, whichever is earlier, unless the parties agree to a later date. (NRS 288.570)
34 Section 2 of this bill authorizes parties who do not reach an agreement to request a
35 mediator: (1) after at least six meetings of negotiations or on or before September 5
36 of an even-numbered year when one of the parties is a bargaining unit with an
37 existing collective bargaining agreement; or (2) after at least eight meetings of
38 negotiations or 90 days after the parties begin negotiating, whichever is earlier,
39 when one of the parties is a bargaining unit negotiating to enter a collective
40 bargaining agreement for the first time.
41 Under existing law, if the representative of the Executive Department and the
42 exclusive representative of a bargaining unit do not reach a collective bargaining
43 agreement through mediation within 10 days after the appointment of a mediator,
44 mediation is required to cease and the parties are required to begin arbitration
45 proceedings on or before February 15 unless the parties agree to a later date. The
46 arbitrator is then required to render a decision on or before March 5. (NRS
47 288.575) Section 3 of this bill: (1) requires arbitration proceedings to begin on or
48 before September 15, rather than February 15; and (2) requires the arbitrator to
49 render a decision on or before December 5, rather than March 5. Section 3 also
50 eliminates the authority for the parties to agree to a later deadline for the decision of
51 the arbitrator.
52 Under existing law, the Economic Forum, a panel of appointed economic and
53 financial experts, prepares a written report of its projections of economic indicators
54 and an estimate of future state revenue for the Governor and Legislature on or
55 before December 3 of each even-numbered year. (NRS 353.228) Section 4 of this
56 bill requires that such a report instead be prepared by November 15 of each even-
57 numbered year.
58 Section 4.3 of this bill makes an appropriation to the Division of Human
59 Resource Management of the Department of Administration for certain personnel,
60 travel, operating and information services costs.
61 Section 4.7 of this bill makes an appropriation to the Office of the Governor for
62 certain personnel, operating, equipment and information services costs.
