Section 1:
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to public employees; requiring the Governor to
include certain information relating to collective bargaining
agreements in the biennial proposed executive budget;
revising certain deadlines relating to the negotiation,
mediation and arbitration of collective bargaining agreements
with the Executive Department of the State Government;
making appropriations; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Under existing law, the Governor may, notwithstanding the provisions of any
collective bargaining agreement, include in the biennial proposed executive budget
of the State any amount of money the Governor deems appropriate for salaries,
wage rates or any other form of direct monetary compensation for employees.
(NRS 288.510) Section 1 of this bill requires the Governor, to the extent
practicable, to include in the biennial proposed executive budget, any amount of
money to be paid as agreed upon in a collective bargaining agreement. Section 1
also requires that if the Governor determines it is impracticable to include such
money in the biennial proposed executive budget, he or she must submit a report
stating the reason for such a determination to the Legislature on the same day the
budget is submitted.
Under existing law, certain groups of employees in the classified service of the
Executive Department of State Government are authorized to engage in collective
bargaining with the Executive Department concerning wages, hours and other terms
and conditions of employment for such employees. (NRS 288.400-288.630) In
general, a collective bargaining agreement for such a group of employees must
begin on July 1 of an odd-numbered year and must end on June 30 of the next odd-
numbered year. (NRS 288.550)
Under existing law, the Governor is required to designate a representative to
conduct negotiations concerning collective bargaining agreements on behalf of the
Executive Department and negotiations between the representative of the Executive
Department and the exclusive representative of a bargaining unit are required to
begin within 60 days after one party notifies the other party of the desire to
negotiate or on or before October 1 of each even-numbered year, whichever is
earlier. (NRS 288.565) Section 1.5 of this bill requires such negotiations to begin:
(1) on or before April 1, rather than October 1, of each even-numbered year; and
(2) within 60 days after an exclusive representative is designated for an
unrepresented bargaining unit.
Under existing law, either the representative of the Executive Department or
the exclusive representative of a bargaining unit are authorized to request a
mediator if the parties do not reach a collective bargaining agreement within 120
days after beginning negotiations or on or before February 1 of an odd-numbered
year, whichever is earlier, unless the parties agree to a later date. (NRS 288.570)

Section 2:
Section 2 of this bill authorizes parties who do not reach an agreement to request a
mediator: (1) after at least six meetings of negotiations or on or before September 5
of an even-numbered year when one of the parties is a bargaining unit with an
existing collective bargaining agreement; or (2) after at least eight meetings of
negotiations or 90 days after the parties begin negotiating, whichever is earlier,
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 2 –
when one of the parties is a bargaining unit negotiating to enter a collective
bargaining agreement for the first time.
Under existing law, if the representative of the Executive Department and the
exclusive representative of a bargaining unit do not reach a collective bargaining
agreement through mediation within 10 days after the appointment of a mediator,
mediation is required to cease and the parties are required to begin arbitration
proceedings on or before February 15 unless the parties agree to a later date. The
arbitrator is then required to render a decision on or before March 5. (NRS

Section 3:
288.575) Section 3 of this bill: (1) requires arbitration proceedings to begin on or
before September 15, rather than February 15; and (2) requires the arbitrator to
render a decision on or before December 5, rather than March 5. Section 3 also
eliminates the authority for the parties to agree to a later deadline for the decision of
the arbitrator.
Under existing law, the Economic Forum, a panel of appointed economic and
financial experts, prepares a written report of its projections of economic indicators
and an estimate of future state revenue for the Governor and Legislature on or
before December 3 of each even-numbered year. (NRS 353.228) Section 4 of this
bill requires that such a report instead be prepared by November 15 of each even-
numbered year.

Section 4:
Section 4.3 of this bill makes an appropriation to the Division of Human
Resource Management of the Department of Administration for certain personnel,
travel, operating and information services costs.

Section 5:
Section 4.7 of this bill makes an appropriation to the Office of the Governor for
certain personnel, operating, equipment and information services costs.

CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to public employees; requiring the Governor to
include certain information relating to collective bargaining
agreements in the biennial proposed executive budget;
revising certain deadlines relating to the negotiation,
mediation and arbitration of collective bargaining agreements
with the Executive Department of the State Government;
making appropriations; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Under existing law, the Governor may, notwithstanding the provisions of any
collective bargaining agreement, include in the biennial proposed executive budget
of the State any amount of money the Governor deems appropriate for salaries,
wage rates or any other form of direct monetary compensation for employees.
(NRS 288.510) Section 1 of this bill requires the Governor, to the extent
practicable, to include in the biennial proposed executive budget, any amount of
money to be paid as agreed upon in a collective bargaining agreement. Section 1
also requires that if the Governor determines it is impracticable to include such
money in the biennial proposed executive budget, he or she must submit a report
stating the reason for such a determination to the Legislature on the same day the
budget is submitted.
Under existing law, certain groups of employees in the classified service of the
Executive Department of State Government are authorized to engage in collective
bargaining with the Executive Department concerning wages, hours and other terms
and conditions of employment for such employees. (NRS 288.400-288.630) In
general, a collective bargaining agreement for such a group of employees must
begin on July 1 of an odd-numbered year and must end on June 30 of the next odd-
numbered year. (NRS 288.550)
Under existing law, the Governor is required to designate a representative to
conduct negotiations concerning collective bargaining agreements on behalf of the
Executive Department and negotiations between the representative of the Executive
Department and the exclusive representative of a bargaining unit are required to
begin within 60 days after one party notifies the other party of the desire to
negotiate or on or before October 1 of each even-numbered year, whichever is
earlier. (NRS 288.565) Section 1.5 of this bill requires such negotiations to begin:
(1) on or before April 1, rather than October 1, of each even-numbered year; and
(2) within 60 days after an exclusive representative is designated for an
unrepresented bargaining unit.
Under existing law, either the representative of the Executive Department or
the exclusive representative of a bargaining unit are authorized to request a
mediator if the parties do not reach a collective bargaining agreement within 120
days after beginning negotiations or on or before February 1 of an odd-numbered
year, whichever is earlier, unless the parties agree to a later date. (NRS 288.570)
Section 2 of this bill authorizes parties who do not reach an agreement to request a
mediator: (1) after at least six meetings of negotiations or on or before September 5
of an even-numbered year when one of the parties is a bargaining unit with an
existing collective bargaining agreement; or (2) after at least eight meetings of
negotiations or 90 days after the parties begin negotiating, whichever is earlier,
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 2 –
when one of the parties is a bargaining unit negotiating to enter a collective
bargaining agreement for the first time.
Under existing law, if the representative of the Executive Department and the
exclusive representative of a bargaining unit do not reach a collective bargaining
agreement through mediation within 10 days after the appointment of a mediator,
mediation is required to cease and the parties are required to begin arbitration
proceedings on or before February 15 unless the parties agree to a later date. The
arbitrator is then required to render a decision on or before March 5. (NRS
288.575) Section 3 of this bill: (1) requires arbitration proceedings to begin on or
before September 15, rather than February 15; and (2) requires the arbitrator to
render a decision on or before December 5, rather than March 5. Section 3 also
eliminates the authority for the parties to agree to a later deadline for the decision of
the arbitrator.
Under existing law, the Economic Forum, a panel of appointed economic and
financial experts, prepares a written report of its projections of economic indicators
and an estimate of future state revenue for the Governor and Legislature on or
before December 3 of each even-numbered year. (NRS 353.228) Section 4 of this
bill requires that such a report instead be prepared by November 15 of each even-
numbered year.
Section 4.3 of this bill makes an appropriation to the Division of Human
Resource Management of the Department of Administration for certain personnel,
travel, operating and information services costs.
Section 4.7 of this bill makes an appropriation to the Office of the Governor for
certain personnel, operating, equipment and information services costs.
