AN ACT relating to public employees; requiring the Governor to include certain
information relating to collective bargaining agreements in the biennial
proposed executive budget; revising certain deadlines relating to the
negotiation, mediation and arbitration of collective bargaining
agreements with the Executive Department of the State Government;
making appropriations; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, the Governor may, notwithstanding the provisions of any collective
2 bargaining agreement, include in the biennial proposed executive budget of the State any
3 amount of money the Governor deems appropriate for salaries, wage rates or any other form
4 of direct monetary compensation for employees. (NRS 288.510) Section 1 of this bill requires
5 the Governor, to the extent practicable, to include in the biennial proposed executive budget,
6 any amount of money to be paid as agreed upon in a collective bargaining agreement. Section
7 1 also requires that if the Governor determines it is impracticable to include such money in the
8 biennial proposed executive budget, he or she must submit a report stating the reason for such
9 a determination to the Legislature on the same day the budget is submitted.
10 Under existing law, certain groups of employees in the classified service of the Executive
11 Department of State Government are authorized to engage in collective bargaining with the
12 Executive Department concerning wages, hours and other terms and conditions of
13 employment for such employees. (NRS 288.400-288.630) In general, a collective bargaining
14 agreement for such a group of employees must begin on July 1 of an odd-numbered year and
15 must end on June 30 of the next odd-numbered year. (NRS 288.550)
16 Under existing law, the Governor is required to designate a representative to conduct
17 negotiations concerning collective bargaining agreements on behalf of the Executive
18 Department and negotiations between the representative of the Executive Department and the
19 exclusive representative of a bargaining unit are required to begin within 60 days after one
20 party notifies the other party of the desire to negotiate or on or before October 1 of each even-
21 numbered year, whichever is earlier. (NRS 288.565) Section 1.5 of this bill requires such
22 negotiations to begin: (1) on or before April 1, rather than October 1, of each even-numbered
23 year; and (2) within 60 days after an exclusive representative is designated for an
24 unrepresented bargaining unit.
25 Under existing law, either the representative of the Executive Department or the exclusive
26 representative of a bargaining unit are authorized to request a mediator if the parties do not

Assembly Amendment No. 839 to Assembly Bill No. 356 First Reprint Page 4
27 reach a collective bargaining agreement within 120 days after beginning negotiations or on or
28 before February 1 of an odd-numbered year, whichever is earlier, unless the parties agree to a
29 later date. (NRS 288.570) Section 2 of this bill authorizes parties who do not reach an
30 agreement to request a mediator: (1) after at least six meetings of negotiations or on or before
31 September 5 of an even-numbered year when one of the parties is a bargaining unit with an
32 existing collective bargaining agreement; or (2) after at least eight meetings of negotiations or
33 90 days after the parties begin negotiating, whichever is earlier, when one of the parties is a
34 bargaining unit negotiating to enter a collective bargaining agreement for the first time.
35 Under existing law, if the representative of the Executive Department and the exclusive
36 representative of a bargaining unit do not reach a collective bargaining agreement through
37 mediation within 10 days after the appointment of a mediator, mediation is required to cease
38 and the parties are required to begin arbitration proceedings on or before February 15 unless
39 the parties agree to a later date. The arbitrator is then required to render a decision on or
40 before March 5. (NRS 288.575) Section 3 of this bill: (1) requires arbitration proceedings to
41 begin on or before September 15, rather than February 15; and (2) requires the arbitrator to
42 render a decision on or before December 5, rather than March 5. Section 3 also eliminates the
43 authority for the parties to agree to a later deadline for the decision of the arbitrator.
44 Under existing law, the Economic Forum, a panel of appointed economic and financial
45 experts, prepares a written report of its projections of economic indicators and an estimate of
46 future state revenue for the Governor and Legislature on or before December 3 of each even-
47 numbered year. (NRS 353.228) Section 4 of this bill requires that such a report instead be
48 prepared by November 15 of each even-numbered year.
49 Section 4.3 of this bill makes an appropriation to the Division of Human Resource
50 Management of the Department of Administration for certain personnel, travel,
51 operating and information services costs.
52 Section 4.7 of this bill makes an appropriation to the Office of the Governor for
53 certain personnel, operating, equipment and information services costs.
