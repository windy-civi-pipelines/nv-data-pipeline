FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public employees; requiring the Governor to include certain
information relating to collective bargaining agreements in the
biennial proposed executive budget; revising certain deadlines
relating to the negotiation, mediation and arbitration of collective
bargaining agreements with the Executive Department of the State
Government; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, the Governor may, notwithstanding the provisions of any
2 collective bargaining agreement, include in the biennial proposed executive budget of the
3 State any amount of money the Governor deems appropriate for salaries, wage rates or
4 any other form of direct monetary compensation for employees. (NRS 288.510) Section 1
5 of this bill requires the Governor, to the extent practicable, to include in the biennial
6 proposed executive budget, any amount of money to be paid as agreed upon in a
7 collective bargaining agreement. Section 1 also requires that if the Governor determines
8 it is impracticable to include such money in the biennial proposed executive budget, he
9 or she must submit a report stating the reason for such a determination to the
10 Legislature on the same day the budget is submitted.
11 Under existing law, certain groups of employees in the classified service of the Executive
12 Department of State Government are authorized to engage in collective bargaining with the
13 Executive Department concerning wages, hours and other terms and conditions of
14 employment for such employees. (NRS 288.400-288.630) In general, a collective bargaining
15 agreement for such a group of employees must begin on July 1 of an odd-numbered year and
16 must end on June 30 of the next odd-numbered year. (NRS 288.550)
17 Under existing law, the Governor is required to designate a representative to conduct
18 negotiations concerning collective bargaining agreements on behalf of the Executive
19 Department and negotiations between the representative of the Executive Department and the
20 exclusive representative of a bargaining unit are required to begin within 60 days after one
21 party notifies the other party of the desire to negotiate or on or before October 1 of each even-
22 numbered year, whichever is earlier. (NRS 288.565) Section [1] 1.5 of this bill requires such
23 negotiations to begin : (1) on or before [June] April 1, rather than October 1, of each even-
24 numbered year [.]; and (2) within 60 days after an exclusive representative is designated
25 for an unrepresented bargaining unit.
26 Under existing law, either the representative of the Executive Department or the exclusive
27 representative of a bargaining unit are authorized to request a mediator if the parties do not
Assembly Amendment No. 375 to Assembly Bill No. 356 Page 4
28 reach a collective bargaining agreement within 120 days after beginning negotiations or on or
29 before February 1 of an odd-numbered year, whichever is earlier, unless the parties agree to a
30 later date. (NRS 288.570) Section 2 of this bill authorizes parties who do not reach an
31 agreement to request a mediator [120 days after beginning] : (1) after at least six meetings of
32 negotiations or on or before [October 1, rather than February 1.] September 5 of an even-
33 numbered year when one of the parties is a bargaining unit with an existing collective
34 bargaining agreement; or (2) after at least eight meetings of negotiations or 90 days after
35 the parties begin negotiating, whichever is earlier, when one of the parties is a
36 bargaining unit negotiating to enter a collective bargaining agreement for the first time.
37 Under existing law, if the representative of the Executive Department and the exclusive
38 representative of a bargaining unit do not reach a collective bargaining agreement through
39 mediation within 10 days after the appointment of a mediator, mediation is required to cease
40 and the parties are required to begin arbitration proceedings on or before February 15 unless
41 the parties agree to a later date. The arbitrator is then required to render a decision on or
42 before March 5. (NRS 288.575) Section 3 of this bill: (1) requires arbitration proceedings to
43 begin on or before [October] September 15, rather than February 15; and (2) requires the
44 arbitrator to render a decision on or before [November] December 5, rather than March 5.
45 Section 3 also eliminates the authority for the parties to agree to a later deadline for the
46 decision of the arbitrator.
47 Under existing law, the Economic Forum, a panel of appointed economic and
48 financial experts, prepares a written report of its projections of economic indicators and
49 an estimate of future state revenue for the Governor and Legislature on or before
50 December 3 of each even-numbered year. (NRS 353.228) Section 4 of this bill requires
51 that such a report instead be prepared by November 15 of each even-numbered year.

1 Under existing law, the Governor may, notwithstanding the provisions of any
2 collective bargaining agreement, include in the biennial proposed executive budget of the
3 State any amount of money the Governor deems appropriate for salaries, wage rates or
4 any other form of direct monetary compensation for employees. (NRS 288.510) Section 1
5 of this bill requires the Governor, to the extent practicable, to include in the biennial

28 reach a collective bargaining agreement within 120 days after beginning negotiations or on or
29 before February 1 of an odd-numbered year, whichever is earlier, unless the parties agree to a
30 later date. (NRS 288.570) Section 2 of this bill authorizes parties who do not reach an
31 agreement to request a mediator [120 days after beginning] : (1) after at least six meetings of
32 negotiations or on or before [October 1, rather than February 1.] September 5 of an even-

34 bargaining agreement; or (2) after at least eight meetings of negotiations or 90 days after

44 arbitrator to render a decision on or before [November] December 5, rather than March 5.
45 Section 3 also eliminates the authority for the parties to agree to a later deadline for the
46 decision of the arbitrator.
47 Under existing law, the Economic Forum, a panel of appointed economic and
48 financial experts, prepares a written report of its projections of economic indicators and
49 an estimate of future state revenue for the Governor and Legislature on or before
50 December 3 of each even-numbered year. (NRS 353.228) Section 4 of this bill requires
