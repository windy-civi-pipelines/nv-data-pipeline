SUMMARY—Revises provisions governing certain orders for
protection against domestic violence. (BDR 3-824)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to domestic violence; revising provisions
governing certain orders for protection against domestic
violence; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides that an order for protection against domestic violence
2 issued by the court of another state, territory or Indian tribe within the United States
3 is valid and must be accorded full faith and credit and enforced by the courts of this
4 State as if it were issued by a court in this State. In enforcing such an order, a law
5 enforcement officer is required to make an arrest for a violation of the order in the
6 same manner that an officer would make an arrest for a violation of a temporary or
7 extended order issued by a court of this State unless it is apparent to the officer that
8 the order is not authentic on its face. In enforcing such an order, a law enforcement
9 officer is authorized to rely on certain evidence. (NRS 33.085) This bill expands the
10 type of evidence upon which a law enforcement officer may rely to include: (1) a
11 hard copy or digital image of an order for protection against domestic violence that
12 has been provided to the officer; and (2) any statement by the person against whom
13 the order is being enforced. This bill also creates a process for a law enforcement
14 officer of this State, when an otherwise valid order for protection against domestic
15 violence is issued by the court of another state, territory or Indian tribe within the
16 United States but the officer cannot confirm that the respondent has been notified or
17 served with the order, to provide notice, attempt service and give reasonable
18 opportunity for compliance before enforcing the order.

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 33.085 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 33.085 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2, an
3 order for protection against domestic violence issued by the court of
4 another state, territory or Indian tribe within the United States,
5 including, without limitation, any provisions in the order related to
6 custody and support, is valid and must be accorded full faith and
7 credit and enforced by the courts of this State as if it were issued by
8 a court in this State, regardless of whether the order has been
9 registered in this State, if the court in this State determines that:
10 (a) The issuing court had jurisdiction over the parties and the
11 subject matter under the laws of the state, territory or Indian tribe in
12 which the order was issued; and
13 (b) The adverse party was given reasonable notice and an
14 opportunity to be heard before the order was issued or, in the case of
15 an ex parte order, the adverse party was given reasonable notice and
16 an opportunity to be heard within the time required by the laws of
17 the issuing state, territory or tribe and, in any event, within a
18 reasonable time after the order was issued.
19 2. If the order for protection against domestic violence issued
20 by the court of another state, territory or Indian tribe is a mutual
21 order for protection against domestic violence and:
22 (a) No counter or cross-petition or other pleading was filed by
23 the adverse party; or
24 (b) A counter or cross-petition or other pleading was filed and
25 the court did not make a specific finding of domestic violence by
26 both parties,
27  the court shall refuse to enforce the order against the applicant
28 and may determine whether to issue its own temporary or extended
29 order.
30 3. A law enforcement officer shall enforce an order for
31 protection against domestic violence issued by the court of another
32 state, territory or Indian tribe and shall make an arrest for a violation
33 thereof in the same manner that a law enforcement officer would
34 make an arrest for a violation of a temporary or extended order
35 issued by a court of this State unless it is apparent to the officer that
36 the order is not authentic on its face. An officer shall determine that
37 an order is authentic on its face if the order contains:
38 (a) The names of the parties;
39 (b) Information indicating that the order has not expired; and
40 (c) Information indicating that the court which issued the order
41 had legal authority to issue the order as evidenced by a certified
42 copy of the order, a file-stamped copy of the order, an authorized

1 signature or stamp of the court which issued the order or another
2 indication of the authority of the court which issued the order.
3  An officer may determine that any other order is authentic on its
4 face.
5 4. In enforcing an order for protection against domestic
6 violence issued by the court of another state, territory or Indian tribe
7 or arresting a person for a violation of such an order, a law
8 enforcement officer may rely upon:
9 (a) A hard copy or digital image of an order for protection
10 against domestic violence that has been provided to the officer;
11 (b) An order for protection against domestic violence that is
12 included in the Repository for Information Concerning Orders for
13 Protection pursuant to NRS 33.095 or in any national crime
14 information database;
15 (c) Oral or written confirmation from a law enforcement agency
16 or court in the jurisdiction in which the order for protection against
17 domestic violence was issued that the order is valid and effective; or
18 (d) An examination of the totality of the circumstances
19 concerning the existence of a valid and effective order for protection
20 against domestic violence, including, without limitation, the
21 statement of a person protected by the order that the order remains
22 in effect [.] and any statement by the person against whom the
23 order is being enforced.
24 5. If a law enforcement officer of this State determines that
25 an otherwise valid order for protection against domestic violence
26 was issued by the court of another state, territory or Indian tribe
27 within the United States but cannot confirm that the respondent
28 has been notified or served with the order, the officer shall:
29 (a) Inform the respondent of the order, including, without
30 limitation, by providing verbal notice of the terms of the order,
31 which shall be deemed sufficient notice;
32 (b) Make a reasonable effort to serve the order upon the
33 respondent; and
34 (c) Allow the respondent a reasonable opportunity to comply
35 with the order before enforcing the order.
36 6. A law enforcement officer shall document any actions
37 taken pursuant to subsection 5 and cooperate with the court in the
38 jurisdiction in which the order was issued for proof of service.
39 7. The fact that an order has not been registered or included in
40 the Repository for Information Concerning Orders for Protection in
41 the Central Repository for Nevada Records of Criminal History
42 pursuant to NRS 33.095 or in any national crime information
43 database is not grounds for a law enforcement officer to refuse to
44 enforce the terms of the order unless it is apparent to the officer that
45 the order is not authentic on its face.
