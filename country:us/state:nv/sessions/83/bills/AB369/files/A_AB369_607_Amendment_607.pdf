EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to domestic violence; revising provisions governing certain
orders for protection against domestic violence; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides that an order for protection against domestic violence issued by the
2 court of another state, territory or Indian tribe within the United States is valid and must be
3 accorded full faith and credit and enforced by the courts of this State as if it were issued by a
4 court in this State. In enforcing such an order, a law enforcement officer is required to make
5 an arrest for a violation of the order in the same manner that an officer would make an arrest
6 for a violation of a temporary or extended order issued by a court of this State unless it is
7 apparent to the officer that the order is not authentic on its face. In enforcing such an order, a
8 law enforcement officer is authorized to rely on certain evidence. (NRS 33.085) This bill
9 expands the type of evidence upon which a law enforcement officer may rely to include: (1) a
10 hard copy or digital image of an order for protection against domestic violence that has been
11 provided to the officer; and (2) any statement by the person against whom the order is being
12 enforced. This bill also creates a process for a law enforcement [,] officer of this State, when
13 an otherwise valid order for protection against domestic violence is issued by the court of
14 another state, territory or Indian tribe within the United States but the officer cannot [be
15 enforced because] confirm that the respondent has [not] been notified or served with the
16 order, to provide notice, attempt service and give reasonable opportunity for compliance
17 before enforcing the order.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 33.085 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 33.085 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2, an order for
3 protection against domestic violence issued by the court of another state, territory
4 or Indian tribe within the United States, including, without limitation, any
5 provisions in the order related to custody and support, is valid and must be
6 accorded full faith and credit and enforced by the courts of this State as if it were

Senate Amendment No. 607 to Assembly Bill No. 369 Page 4
1 issued by a court in this State, regardless of whether the order has been registered in
2 this State, if the court in this State determines that:
3 (a) The issuing court had jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter
4 under the laws of the state, territory or Indian tribe in which the order was issued;
5 and
6 (b) The adverse party was given reasonable notice and an opportunity to be
7 heard before the order was issued or, in the case of an ex parte order, the adverse
8 party was given reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard within the time
9 required by the laws of the issuing state, territory or tribe and, in any event, within a
10 reasonable time after the order was issued.
11 2. If the order for protection against domestic violence issued by the court of
12 another state, territory or Indian tribe is a mutual order for protection against
13 domestic violence and:
14 (a) No counter or cross-petition or other pleading was filed by the adverse
15 party; or
16 (b) A counter or cross-petition or other pleading was filed and the court did not
17 make a specific finding of domestic violence by both parties,
18  the court shall refuse to enforce the order against the applicant and may
19 determine whether to issue its own temporary or extended order.
20 3. A law enforcement officer shall enforce an order for protection against
21 domestic violence issued by the court of another state, territory or Indian tribe and
22 shall make an arrest for a violation thereof in the same manner that a law
23 enforcement officer would make an arrest for a violation of a temporary or
24 extended order issued by a court of this State unless it is apparent to the officer that
25 the order is not authentic on its face. An officer shall determine that an order is
26 authentic on its face if the order contains:
27 (a) The names of the parties;
28 (b) Information indicating that the order has not expired; and
29 (c) Information indicating that the court which issued the order had legal
30 authority to issue the order as evidenced by a certified copy of the order, a file-
31 stamped copy of the order, an authorized signature or stamp of the court which
32 issued the order or another indication of the authority of the court which issued the
33 order.
34  An officer may determine that any other order is authentic on its face.
35 4. In enforcing an order for protection against domestic violence issued by the
36 court of another state, territory or Indian tribe or arresting a person for a violation of
37 such an order, a law enforcement officer may rely upon:
38 (a) A hard copy or digital image of an order for protection against domestic
39 violence that has been provided to the officer;
40 (b) An order for protection against domestic violence that is included in the
41 Repository for Information Concerning Orders for Protection pursuant to NRS
42 33.095 or in any national crime information database;
43 (c) Oral or written confirmation from a law enforcement agency or court in the
44 jurisdiction in which the order for protection against domestic violence was issued
45 that the order is valid and effective; or
46 (d) An examination of the totality of the circumstances concerning the
47 existence of a valid and effective order for protection against domestic violence,
48 including, without limitation, the statement of a person protected by the order that
49 the order remains in effect [.] and any statement by the person against whom the
50 order is being enforced.
51 5. If a law enforcement officer of this State determines that an otherwise
52 valid order for protection against domestic violence was issued by the court of
53 another state, territory or Indian tribe within the United States but cannot [be

Senate Amendment No. 607 to Assembly Bill No. 369 Page 5
1 enforced because] confirm that the respondent has [not] been notified or served
2 with the order, the officer shall:
3 (a) Inform the respondent of the order, including, without limitation, by
4 providing verbal notice of the terms of the order, which shall be deemed sufficient
5 notice;
6 (b) Make a reasonable effort to serve the order upon the respondent; and
7 (c) Allow the respondent a reasonable opportunity to comply with the order
8 before enforcing the order.
9 6. A law enforcement officer shall document any actions taken pursuant to
10 subsection 5 and cooperate with the court in the jurisdiction in which the order
11 was issued for proof of service.
12 7. The fact that an order has not been registered or included in the Repository
13 for Information Concerning Orders for Protection in the Central Repository for
14 Nevada Records of Criminal History pursuant to NRS 33.095 or in any national
15 crime information database is not grounds for a law enforcement officer to refuse to
16 enforce the terms of the order unless it is apparent to the officer that the order is not
17 authentic on its face.
18 [6.] 8. A court or law enforcement officer who enforces an order for
19 protection against domestic violence issued by the court of another state, territory
20 or Indian tribe based upon a reasonable belief that the order is valid or who refuses
21 to enforce such an order based upon a reasonable belief that the order is not valid
22 and the employer of such a law enforcement officer are immune from civil and
23 criminal liability for any action taken or not taken based on that belief.
