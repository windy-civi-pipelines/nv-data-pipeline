Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides that an employee of or a contractor or volunteer for a

3 is guilty of a category D felony. (NRS 212.188) Section 3 of this bill: (1) increases

5 felony; and (2) makes the crime punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for
6 a minimum term of not less than 1 year and a maximum term of not more than 10
7 years.
8 Existing law provides that an employee of or a contractor or volunteer for a
9 prison who voluntarily: (1) engages in unauthorized custodial conduct is guilty of
10 a gross misdemeanor; or (2) attempts to engage in such conduct is guilty of a
11 misdemeanor. (NRS 212.188) Section 3 increases the penalty for unauthorized
12 custodial conduct from a gross misdemeanor to a category C felony. Section 3 also
13 eliminates provisions relating to attempted unauthorized custodial conduct.
14 Existing law makes it a crime for certain persons to furnish a controlled
15 substance or intoxicating liquor to a prisoner. (NRS 212.160) Section 2 of this bill
16 changes the term “intoxicating liquor” to “intoxicant” and defines the term
17 intoxicant for the purposes of this prohibition to mean: (1) a controlled substance
18 analog; (2) a spirituous or malt liquor or beverage; (3) a synthetic cannabinoid; or
