EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to governmental administration; authorizing the Legislative
Commission to suspend or nullify certain administrative regulations in
certain circumstances; revising provisions relating to judicial review of
certain administrative regulations in certain circumstances; revising
provisions relating to certain administrative regulations and
procedures; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under the separation-of-powers provision of the Nevada Constitution, one department of
2 the State Government may not exercise powers properly belonging to another department of
3 the State Government “except in the cases expressly directed or permitted in this
4 constitution.” (Nev. Const. Art. 3, § 1) As a general rule under the separation-of-powers
5 doctrine, because the question of whether a regulation adopted by an executive agency
6 exceeds its statutory authority or is inconsistent with legislative intent presents a question of
7 statutory interpretation, the power to resolve that question of statutory interpretation and
8 determine whether to invalidate or nullify the regulation is usually regarded as judicial power
9 because “it is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the
10 law is.” (Nevadans for Nev. v. Beers, 122 Nev. 930, 943 n.20 (2006) (quoting Marbury v.
11 Madison, 3 U.S. 137, 177-78 (1803)); Berkson v. LePome, 126 Nev. 492, 499 (2010)
12 (explaining that “[t]o declare what the law is or has been is judicial power; to declare what the
13 law shall be is legislative.” (quoting 1 Thomas M. Cooley, Constitutional Limitations 191 (8th
14 ed. 1927)); Silver State Elec. Supply Co. v. State ex rel. Dep’t of Tax’n, 123 Nev. 80, 84
15 (2007) (“appeals involving interpretation of a statute or regulation present questions of law
16 subject to our independent review.”))
17 For example, in applying the separation-of-powers doctrine to the Federal Government
18 and other state governments, courts have found that the separation-of-powers doctrine
19 ordinarily prohibits legislative committees or other legislative bodies from exercising the
20 power to nullify a regulation adopted by an executive agency on the basis that the regulation
21 exceeds the statutory authority of the agency or is inconsistent with legislative intent, unless
22 Congress or the state legislature passes a law that expressly nullifies the regulation or revises
23 or repeals the agency’s statutory authority. (I.N.S. v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 953 n.16 (1983);
24 State v. A.L.I.V.E. Voluntary, 606 P.2d 769, 772-79 (Alaska 1980); Legis. Research Comm’n
25 v. Brown, 664 S.W.2d 907, 917-20 (Ky. 1984); Blank v. Dep’t of Corr., 611 N.W.2d 530, 537-
26 39 (Mich. 2000); General Assembly of N.J. v. Byrne, 448 A.2d 438, 443-49 (N.J. 1982); State
27 ex rel. Barker v. Manchin, 279 S.E.2d 622, 630-36 (W. Va. 1981))
Senate Amendment No. 485 to Senate Bill No. 340 Page 4
28 However, in Nevada, the voters in 1996 approved a constitutional amendment to
29 Nevada’s separation-of-powers provision which expressly empowers the Legislature to
30 provide by law for legislative agencies and legislative bodies composed of members of the
31 Senate and Assembly to suspend or nullify regulations adopted by executive agencies on the
32 basis that the regulations exceed the statutory authority of the agencies or are inconsistent with
33 legislative intent. The constitutional amendment provides that if the Legislature authorizes the
34 adoption of regulations by executive agencies which bind persons outside the agencies, the
35 Legislature is authorized to enact laws providing for: (1) the review of such regulations by a
36 legislative agency before their effective date to determine whether each such regulation is
37 within the statutory authority for its adoption; (2) the suspension by a legislative agency of
38 any such regulation which appears to exceed the statutory authority for its adoption until the
39 regulation is reviewed by a legislative body composed of members of the Senate and
40 Assembly; and (3) the nullification of any such regulation by a majority vote of a legislative
41 body composed of members of the Senate and Assembly. (Nev. Const. Art. 3, § 1) When the
42 constitutional amendment was presented to the voters, the ballot materials explained that its
43 purpose was to ensure that the Legislative Department had the specific constitutional power to
44 suspend or nullify regulations adopted by executive agencies which exceed the statutory
45 authority granted by the Legislature when it passed the laws that authorized the agencies to
46 adopt the regulations. (State of Nevada Ballot Questions 1996, Question No. 5, at pp. 1-2
47 (Nev. Sec’y of State 1996))
48 When the Nevada Constitution expressly grants specific powers to the Legislative
49 Department, the other departments may not infringe upon the exercise of those powers out of
50 respect for an equal and coordinate department of government. (Heller v. Legislature, 120
51 Nev. 456, 466-72 (2004); Comm’n on Ethics v. Hardy, 125 Nev. 285, 291-94 (2009)) For
52 example, the Nevada Supreme Court has determined that because the Nevada Constitution
53 expressly grants to each legislative House the specific power to “judge” the qualifications,
54 returns and elections of its own members, the constitutional assignment of that power to the
55 Legislative Department “insulates a legislator’s qualifications to hold office from judicial
56 review. In other words, a legislative body’s decision to admit or expel a member is almost
57 unreviewable by the courts.” (Heller v. Legislature, 120 Nev. 456, 466-67 (2004)) Because
58 Nevada’s voters expressly granted specific constitutional power to the Legislature to provide
59 by law for legislative agencies and legislative bodies composed of members of the Senate and
60 Assembly to suspend or nullify regulations adopted by executive agencies, the other
61 departments may not infringe upon the exercise of that power out of respect for an equal and
62 coordinate department of government. Section 1 of this bill expresses the Legislature’s
63 findings and declaration regarding its exercise of its expressly granted and specific
64 constitutional power to suspend or nullify such regulations.
65 In exercising its expressly granted and specific constitutional power regarding agency
66 regulations, the Legislature has enacted provisions of the Nevada Administrative Procedure
67 Act which set forth the procedures for the adoption of emergency, temporary and permanent
68 regulations by certain executive agencies. (NRS 233B.0395-233B.120) Under existing law,
69 with limited exceptions, the Legislative Commission or the Subcommittee to Review
70 Regulations of the Legislative Commission has the authority to review and to approve or
71 object to certain temporary or permanent regulations before those regulations become
72 effective. (NRS 233B.067-233B.070)
73 Section 3 of this bill authorizes a person or an executive agency to submit a petition
74 requesting the Legislative Commission to review whether a permanent or temporary
75 regulation adopted pursuant to the Nevada Administrative Procedure Act should be suspended
76 or nullified because the regulation: (1) exceeds the statutory authority for its adoption; (2) is
77 inconsistent with the intent of the Legislature in granting the statutory authority for its
78 adoption; or (3) is not being administered or interpreted in a manner that is consistent with the
79 agency’s stated intent when adopting the regulation or the agency’s stated intent during the
80 review and approval of the regulation by the Legislative Commission. In addition, section 16
81 of this bill authorizes a court to order the plaintiff in an action for a declaratory
82 judgment to submit a petition to the Legislative Commission pursuant to section 3 if all
83 or any part of the action relates to whether a regulation violates statutory provisions or
84 exceeds the statutory authority of an agency. Section 3 : [also:] (1) establishes procedures
85 for the review and consideration of such petitions; (2) authorizes the Legislative Commission
86 to suspend or nullify a regulation based on certain grounds raised in such petitions; and (3)
Senate Amendment No. 485 to Senate Bill No. 340 Page 5
87 requires certain actions to be taken after a suspension or nullification. Additionally, sections 3
88 and 5 of this bill preclude judicial review of any action taken or determination made by the
89 Legislative Commission in exercising its powers to review, object to, suspend or nullify a
90 regulation. Sections 5, 10, 11, 15 and 16 of this bill make conforming changes relating to the
91 authority of the Legislative Commission to suspend or nullify a regulation.
92 Section 4 of this bill requires the Legislative Commission to adopt such regulations as are
93 necessary to carry out the provisions of the Nevada Administrative Procedure Act governing
94 administrative regulations. Section 4 also requires the regulations to: (1) include procedural
95 standards that provide interested persons with an opportunity to comment on issues raised in a
96 petition and whether the regulation should be suspended or nullified; and (2) be included in
97 the Nevada Administrative Code.
98 Existing law excludes the application of certain agency policies to a person with
99 sufficient prior actual notice of the policy from the definition of “regulation” for the purposes
100 of the Nevada Administrative Procedure Act. (NRS 233B.038) Section 6 of this bill removes
101 this exception, which has the effect of requiring such policies to be adopted in a regulation
102 under the Nevada Administrative Procedure Act.
103 Existing law ratifies the Nevada Administrative Code as revised or supplemented before
104 May 15, 1987. (NRS 233B.0395) Section 7 of this bill ratifies the Code as revised or
105 supplemented before February 3, 2025.
106 Existing law requires an agency to adopt a proposed regulation not later than 2 years after
107 the proposed regulation is submitted to the Legislative Counsel. (NRS 233B.040) Section 8 of
108 this bill requires an agency to also submit the proposed regulation to the Legislative
109 Commission for review within the same 2-year period.
110 Existing law requires an agency to hold an oral public hearing on a proposed regulation if
111 an oral hearing is requested by certain persons and the proposed regulation is substantive.
112 (NRS 233B.061) Section 9 of this bill eliminates the requirement regarding the
113 substantiveness of the regulation, which has the effect of requiring an oral hearing on all
114 proposed regulations.
115 Under existing law, the Legislative Counsel is required to prepare and publish a Register
116 of Administrative Regulations, which includes information relating to adopted permanent
117 regulations. (NRS 233B.0653) Section 12 of this bill eliminates the requirement that the
118 Legislative Counsel publish paper copies of the Register and instead requires the Legislative
119 Counsel to publish the Register electronically on the public Internet website of the
120 Legislature.
121 An emergency regulation becomes effective when certain documents are filed with the
122 Secretary of State. (NRS 233B.070) Sections 10 and 14 of this bill require a copy of the
123 written statement of the emergency endorsed by the Governor to be included with the
124 information that is required be filed with the Secretary of State before an emergency
125 regulation becomes effective.
126 Existing law authorizes a plaintiff to bring an action for declaratory judgment on an
127 allegation that a regulation, or its proposed application, interferes with or impairs, or threatens
128 to interfere with or impair, the legal rights or privileges of the plaintiff. Under existing law, a
129 court is required to declare the regulation invalid if it finds that the regulation violates
130 constitutional or statutory provisions or exceeds the statutory authority of the agency that
131 adopted the regulation. (NRS 233B.110)
132 In determining whether a regulation violates statutory provisions or exceeds the statutory
133 authority of an agency, the Nevada Supreme Court has held that “courts should not substitute
134 their own construction of a statutory provision for a reasonable interpretation made by an
135 agency.” (Collins Disc. Liquors & Vending v. State, Dep’t of Tax’n, 106 Nev. 766, 768
136 (1990)) The Nevada Supreme Court has also held that “the interpretation by the agency
137 charged with administering a statute is persuasive, and that great deference should be given to
138 that interpretation if it is within the language of the statute.” (Nev. Tax Comm’n v. Nev.
139 Cement Co., 117 Nev. 960, 968-69 (2001))
140 However, because the Nevada Administrative Procedure Act does not include any
141 specific provisions regarding whether any deference should be given to the Legislative
142 Commission’s approval of a regulation, the Nevada Supreme Court has declined to give any
143 deference to the Legislative Commission’s approval of the regulation, even though such
144 approval includes the Legislative Commission’s legal determination that the regulation
145 conforms to the statutory authority pursuant to which it was adopted and carries out the
Senate Amendment No. 485 to Senate Bill No. 340 Page 6
146 Legislature’s intent in granting that authority. (Killebrew v. State ex rel. Donahue, 139 Nev.
147 Adv. Op. No. 43, 535 P.3d 1167, 1173 n.4 (2023) (“The Legislative Commission, as amicus
148 curiae, urges us to give deference to its approval of the regulation and to review whether the
149 regulation is reasonable as a matter of law. We decline the invitation to alter our statutorily
150 mandated review of a regulation.”))
151 Section 16 amends the Nevada Administrative Procedure Act to provide that in any
152 action where the court must determine whether a regulation violates statutory provisions or
153 exceeds the statutory authority of an agency and the Legislative Commission or the
154 Subcommittee to Review Regulations has approved the regulation under the Nevada
155 Administrative Procedure Act, the court: (1) must not substitute its judgment for the legal
156 determination of the Legislative Commission or the Subcommittee to Review Regulations,
157 made through its legislative approval of the regulation, that the regulation conforms to the
158 statutory authority pursuant to which it was adopted and carries out the Legislature’s intent in
159 granting that authority; (2) must make every reasonable effort and indulge in every reasonable
160 presumption to uphold that legislative legal determination and must resolve any ambiguity,
161 uncertainty or doubt against the plaintiff and in favor of that legislative legal determination;
162 and (3) must give great weight and deference to that legislative legal determination and must
163 uphold that legislative legal determination if it is reasonable as a matter of law. Section 13 of
164 this bill makes conforming changes.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. 1. The Legislature hereby finds that:
2 (a) Under the separation-of-powers provision of Section 1 of Article 3 of the
3 Nevada Constitution, one department of the State Government may not exercise
4 powers properly belonging to another department of the State Government except
5 in cases expressly directed or permitted in the Nevada Constitution.
6 (b) In 1996, Nevada’s voters approved a constitutional amendment to the
7 separation-of-powers provision which expressly empowers the Legislature to
8 provide by law for legislative agencies and legislative bodies composed of
9 members of the Senate and Assembly to suspend or nullify regulations adopted by
10 executive agencies on the basis that the regulations exceed the statutory authority of
11 the agencies or are inconsistent with legislative intent.
12 (c) When the constitutional amendment was presented to the voters, the ballot
13 materials explained that its purpose was to ensure that the Legislative Department
14 had the specific constitutional power to suspend or nullify regulations adopted by
15 executive agencies which exceed the statutory authority granted by the Legislature
16 when it passed the laws that authorized the agencies to adopt the regulations.
17 (d) Because Nevada’s voters expressly granted specific constitutional power to
18 the Legislature to provide by law for legislative agencies and legislative bodies
19 composed of members of the Senate and Assembly to suspend or nullify regulations
20 adopted by executive agencies, the other departments may not infringe upon the
21 exercise of that power out of respect for an equal and coordinate department of
22 government.
23 (e) When executive agencies adopt regulations which exceed their statutory
24 authority or are inconsistent with legislative intent, the regulations thwart and
25 undermine the will of the people who, through their elected representatives in the
26 Legislature, determine by properly enacted laws the scope and extent of the
27 authority granted to executive agencies to adopt regulations.
28 (f) When a regulation adopted by an executive agency is alleged to exceed the
29 statutory authority or to be inconsistent with legislative intent, the issue should be
30 resolved by legislative agencies and legislative bodies composed of members of the
Senate Amendment No. 485 to Senate Bill No. 340 Page 7
1 Senate and Assembly under the exclusive power expressly granted by Nevada’s
2 voters to suspend or nullify regulations adopted by executive agencies.
3 2. The Legislature hereby declares that there is a legitimate and compelling
4 need to exercise its expressly granted and specific constitutional power under
5 Section 1 of Article 3 of the Nevada Constitution, in the manner set forth in the
6 provisions of this act, in order to:
7 (a) Provide by law for legislative agencies and legislative bodies composed of
8 members of the Senate and Assembly to suspend or nullify regulations adopted by
9 executive agencies which exceed their statutory authority or are inconsistent with
10 legislative intent; and
11 (b) Protect and safeguard the rights of people against such unlawful and invalid
12 regulations.
13 Sec. 2. Chapter 233B of NRS is hereby amended by adding thereto the
14 provisions set forth as sections 3 and 4 of this act.
15 Sec. 3. 1. [A] In addition to a petition that is required to be submitted
16 pursuant to NRS 233B.110, a person or adopting agency may submit a petition
17 pursuant to this section requesting that the Legislative Commission review
18 whether any permanent or temporary regulation that has been filed with the
19 Secretary of State pursuant to NRS 233B.070 should be suspended or nullified, in
20 whole or in part, based on one or more of the following grounds:
21 (a) The regulation exceeds the statutory authority pursuant to which the
22 regulation was adopted;
23 (b) The regulation does not carry out the intent of the Legislature in granting
24 the statutory authority pursuant to which the regulation was adopted; or
25 (c) The regulation is not being administered or interpreted by the adopting
26 agency in a manner consistent with the stated intent of the agency when adopting
27 the regulation or during the review and approval of the regulation by the
28 Legislative Commission.
29 2. In order to submit a petition pursuant to this section, the person or
30 adopting agency must submit the petition to the Legislative Counsel in a format
31 prescribed by the Legislative Counsel. The petition must contain sufficient
32 allegations and arguments regarding the issues, including citations to relevant
33 legal authorities, to provide for meaningful review of whether the regulation
34 should be suspended or nullified based on one or more of the grounds set forth in
35 subsection 1.
36 3. If a petition is properly submitted to the Legislative Counsel, the Chair of
37 the Legislative Commission shall submit the petition to the Subcommittee to
38 Review Regulations. The Subcommittee to Review Regulations shall review the
39 petition in consultation with the Legislative Counsel [to determine] and make a
40 recommendation to the Chair of the Legislative Commission regarding whether
41 [to] the Chair should schedule the matter for a meeting of the Legislative
42 Commission.
43 4. [The] After receipt of the recommendation made by the Subcommittee to
44 Review Regulations pursuant to subsection 3, the Chair of the Legislative
45 Commission may [schedule] :
46 (a) Schedule the matter for a meeting of the Legislative Commission if the
47 Chair determines that the petition contains sufficient allegations and arguments
48 regarding the issues, including citations to relevant legal authorities, to provide
49 for meaningful review of whether the regulation should be suspended or nullified
50 based on one or more of the grounds set forth in subsection 1 [.
51 5. The Chair of the Legislative Commission may decline] ; or
52 (b) Decline to schedule the matter for a meeting of the Legislative

2 issues, including citations to relevant legal authorities, to provide for meaningful
3 review of whether the regulation should be suspended or nullified based on one
4 or more of the grounds set forth in subsection 1;
5 [(b)] (2) Does not warrant review by the Legislative Commission because it
6 contains substantially the same or similar allegations or arguments regarding the
7 issues presented in previous petitions submitted pursuant to this section; or
8 [(c)] (3) Does not warrant review by the Legislative Commission for any
9 other reason.
10 [6.] 5. If the Chair of the Legislative Commission declines to schedule the
11 matter for a meeting of the Legislative Commission, the Legislative Counsel shall
12 provide written notice of the determination to the [person submitting the petition.]
13 petitioner.
14 [7.] 6. If the Chair of the Legislative Commission decides to schedule the
15 matter for one or more meetings of the Legislative Commission, the Legislative
16 Counsel shall, at least 30 days before the initial meeting to review the petition,
17 provide the [person submitting the petition] petitioner and , if the petitioner is not

25 (1) Must include sufficient information to allow the [person submitting
26 the petition] petitioner and , if the petitioner is not the adopting agency, the
27 adopting agency to prepare for the initial meeting.
28 (2) Does not preclude the Legislative Commission from considering any
29 other issues at the initial or any subsequent meeting to review the petition that
30 could result in the suspension or nullification of the regulation.
31 [8.] 7. At the initial meeting to review the petition, the Chair of the
32 Legislative Commission shall provide the [person submitting the petition]
33 petitioner and , if the petitioner is not the adopting agency, the adopting agency
34 with an opportunity to present comment on the issues raised in the petition and
35 whether the regulation should be suspended or nullified, subject to any
36 reasonable requirements and restrictions on such presentations.
37 [9.] 8. At the initial or any subsequent meeting to review the petition, the
38 Legislative Commission may suspend or nullify the regulation, in whole or in
39 part, if the Legislative Commission determines that the regulation:
40 (a) Exceeds the statutory authority pursuant to which the regulation was
41 adopted;
42 (b) Does not carry out the intent of the Legislature in granting the statutory
43 authority pursuant to which the regulation was adopted; or
44 (c) Is not being administered or interpreted by the adopting agency in a
45 manner consistent with the stated intent of the agency when adopting the
46 regulation or during the review and approval of the regulation by the Legislative
47 Commission.
48 [10.] 9. If the Legislative Commission takes action to suspend or nullify a
49 regulation, in whole or in part, pursuant to this section, the Legislative Counsel
50 shall, as soon as practicable after such action, provide the Secretary of State and
51 the adopting agency with written notice of:

10 available to the public or provided to persons regulated by the agency.
11 [12.] 11. Any action taken or determination made by the Legislative
12 Commission or the Chair of the Legislative Commission pursuant to this section,
13 including, without limitation, any action or determination to suspend or nullify a
14 regulation, in whole or in part, is final and is not subject to judicial review.

17 successor agency that administers the regulation.
18 (b) “Subcommittee to Review Regulations” means the Subcommittee to
19 Review Regulations appointed pursuant to subsection 6 of NRS 233B.067.
20 Sec. 4. 1. The Legislative Commission shall adopt such regulations as are
21 necessary to carry out the provisions of this section and NRS 233B.0395 to
22 233B.120, inclusive, and section 3 of this act. The Legislative Commission’s
23 adoption of such regulations is exempted from the requirements of this chapter
24 and is final and is not subject to judicial review.
25 2. For meetings of the Legislative Commission relating to a petition
26 requesting the suspension or nullification of a regulation pursuant to section 3 of
27 this act, the regulations adopted by the Legislative Commission pursuant to this
28 section must establish procedural standards that provide persons who are
29 regulated by or otherwise interested in the regulation with an opportunity to
30 present comment on the issues raised in the petition and whether the regulation
31 should be suspended or nullified, subject to any reasonable requirements and
32 restrictions on such presentations.
33 3. The Legislative Counsel shall include the regulations adopted by the
34 Legislative Commission pursuant to this section in the Nevada Administrative
35 Code.
36 Sec. 5. NRS 233B.020 is hereby amended to read as follows:
37 233B.020 1. By this chapter, the Legislature intends to establish [minimum]
38 procedural requirements for :
39 (a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b), the regulation-making and
40 adjudication procedure of all agencies of the Executive Department of the State
41 Government and for judicial review of both functions, except as to those agencies
42 expressly exempted pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.
43 (b) The exercise by the Legislative Commission of the power to review, object

46 and 4 of this act, except that the exercise of such a power by the Legislative
47 Commission is final and not subject to judicial review.
48 2. This chapter confers no additional regulation-making authority upon any
49 agency except to the extent provided in subsection 1 of NRS 233B.050.

Senate Amendment No. 485 to Senate Bill No. 340 Page 10
1 Sec. 6. NRS 233B.038 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 233B.038 1. “Regulation” means:
3 (a) An agency rule, standard, directive or statement of general applicability

(BDR 18-1008)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.

~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to governmental administration; authorizing the Legislative
Commission to suspend or nullify certain administrative regulations in
certain circumstances; revising provisions relating to judicial review of
certain administrative regulations in certain circumstances; revising
provisions relating to certain administrative regulations and
procedures; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under the separation-of-powers provision of the Nevada Constitution, one department of
2 the State Government may not exercise powers properly belonging to another department of
3 the State Government “except in the cases expressly directed or permitted in this
4 constitution.” (Nev. Const. Art. 3, § 1) As a general rule under the separation-of-powers
5 doctrine, because the question of whether a regulation adopted by an executive agency
6 exceeds its statutory authority or is inconsistent with legislative intent presents a question of
7 statutory interpretation, the power to resolve that question of statutory interpretation and
8 determine whether to invalidate or nullify the regulation is usually regarded as judicial power
9 because “it is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the
10 law is.” (Nevadans for Nev. v. Beers, 122 Nev. 930, 943 n.20 (2006) (quoting Marbury v.
11 Madison, 3 U.S. 137, 177-78 (1803)); Berkson v. LePome, 126 Nev. 492, 499 (2010)
12 (explaining that “[t]o declare what the law is or has been is judicial power; to declare what the
13 law shall be is legislative.” (quoting 1 Thomas M. Cooley, Constitutional Limitations 191 (8th
14 ed. 1927)); Silver State Elec. Supply Co. v. State ex rel. Dep’t of Tax’n, 123 Nev. 80, 84
15 (2007) (“appeals involving interpretation of a statute or regulation present questions of law
16 subject to our independent review.”))
17 For example, in applying the separation-of-powers doctrine to the Federal Government
18 and other state governments, courts have found that the separation-of-powers doctrine
19 ordinarily prohibits legislative committees or other legislative bodies from exercising the
20 power to nullify a regulation adopted by an executive agency on the basis that the regulation
21 exceeds the statutory authority of the agency or is inconsistent with legislative intent, unless
22 Congress or the state legislature passes a law that expressly nullifies the regulation or revises
23 or repeals the agency’s statutory authority. (I.N.S. v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 953 n.16 (1983);
24 State v. A.L.I.V.E. Voluntary, 606 P.2d 769, 772-79 (Alaska 1980); Legis. Research Comm’n
25 v. Brown, 664 S.W.2d 907, 917-20 (Ky. 1984); Blank v. Dep’t of Corr., 611 N.W.2d 530, 537-
26 39 (Mich. 2000); General Assembly of N.J. v. Byrne, 448 A.2d 438, 443-49 (N.J. 1982); State
27 ex rel. Barker v. Manchin, 279 S.E.2d 622, 630-36 (W. Va. 1981))

Senate Amendment No. 485 to Senate Bill No. 340 Page 4
28 However, in Nevada, the voters in 1996 approved a constitutional amendment to
29 Nevada’s separation-of-powers provision which expressly empowers the Legislature to
30 provide by law for legislative agencies and legislative bodies composed of members of the
31 Senate and Assembly to suspend or nullify regulations adopted by executive agencies on the
32 basis that the regulations exceed the statutory authority of the agencies or are inconsistent with
33 legislative intent. The constitutional amendment provides that if the Legislature authorizes the
34 adoption of regulations by executive agencies which bind persons outside the agencies, the
35 Legislature is authorized to enact laws providing for: (1) the review of such regulations by a
36 legislative agency before their effective date to determine whether each such regulation is
37 within the statutory authority for its adoption; (2) the suspension by a legislative agency of
38 any such regulation which appears to exceed the statutory authority for its adoption until the
39 regulation is reviewed by a legislative body composed of members of the Senate and
40 Assembly; and (3) the nullification of any such regulation by a majority vote of a legislative
41 body composed of members of the Senate and Assembly. (Nev. Const. Art. 3, § 1) When the
42 constitutional amendment was presented to the voters, the ballot materials explained that its
43 purpose was to ensure that the Legislative Department had the specific constitutional power to
44 suspend or nullify regulations adopted by executive agencies which exceed the statutory
45 authority granted by the Legislature when it passed the laws that authorized the agencies to
46 adopt the regulations. (State of Nevada Ballot Questions 1996, Question No. 5, at pp. 1-2
47 (Nev. Sec’y of State 1996))
48 When the Nevada Constitution expressly grants specific powers to the Legislative
49 Department, the other departments may not infringe upon the exercise of those powers out of
50 respect for an equal and coordinate department of government. (Heller v. Legislature, 120
51 Nev. 456, 466-72 (2004); Comm’n on Ethics v. Hardy, 125 Nev. 285, 291-94 (2009)) For
52 example, the Nevada Supreme Court has determined that because the Nevada Constitution
53 expressly grants to each legislative House the specific power to “judge” the qualifications,
54 returns and elections of its own members, the constitutional assignment of that power to the
55 Legislative Department “insulates a legislator’s qualifications to hold office from judicial
56 review. In other words, a legislative body’s decision to admit or expel a member is almost
57 unreviewable by the courts.” (Heller v. Legislature, 120 Nev. 456, 466-67 (2004)) Because
58 Nevada’s voters expressly granted specific constitutional power to the Legislature to provide
59 by law for legislative agencies and legislative bodies composed of members of the Senate and
60 Assembly to suspend or nullify regulations adopted by executive agencies, the other
61 departments may not infringe upon the exercise of that power out of respect for an equal and
62 coordinate department of government. Section 1 of this bill expresses the Legislature’s
63 findings and declaration regarding its exercise of its expressly granted and specific
64 constitutional power to suspend or nullify such regulations.
65 In exercising its expressly granted and specific constitutional power regarding agency
66 regulations, the Legislature has enacted provisions of the Nevada Administrative Procedure
67 Act which set forth the procedures for the adoption of emergency, temporary and permanent
68 regulations by certain executive agencies. (NRS 233B.0395-233B.120) Under existing law,
69 with limited exceptions, the Legislative Commission or the Subcommittee to Review
70 Regulations of the Legislative Commission has the authority to review and to approve or
71 object to certain temporary or permanent regulations before those regulations become
72 effective. (NRS 233B.067-233B.070)
73 Section 3 of this bill authorizes a person or an executive agency to submit a petition
74 requesting the Legislative Commission to review whether a permanent or temporary
75 regulation adopted pursuant to the Nevada Administrative Procedure Act should be suspended
76 or nullified because the regulation: (1) exceeds the statutory authority for its adoption; (2) is
77 inconsistent with the intent of the Legislature in granting the statutory authority for its
78 adoption; or (3) is not being administered or interpreted in a manner that is consistent with the
79 agency’s stated intent when adopting the regulation or the agency’s stated intent during the
80 review and approval of the regulation by the Legislative Commission. In addition, section 16
81 of this bill authorizes a court to order the plaintiff in an action for a declaratory
82 judgment to submit a petition to the Legislative Commission pursuant to section 3 if all
83 or any part of the action relates to whether a regulation violates statutory provisions or
84 exceeds the statutory authority of an agency. Section 3 : [also:] (1) establishes procedures
85 for the review and consideration of such petitions; (2) authorizes the Legislative Commission
86 to suspend or nullify a regulation based on certain grounds raised in such petitions; and (3)

Senate Amendment No. 485 to Senate Bill No. 340 Page 5
87 requires certain actions to be taken after a suspension or nullification. Additionally, sections 3
88 and 5 of this bill preclude judicial review of any action taken or determination made by the
89 Legislative Commission in exercising its powers to review, object to, suspend or nullify a
90 regulation. Sections 5, 10, 11, 15 and 16 of this bill make conforming changes relating to the
91 authority of the Legislative Commission to suspend or nullify a regulation.
92 Section 4 of this bill requires the Legislative Commission to adopt such regulations as are
93 necessary to carry out the provisions of the Nevada Administrative Procedure Act governing
94 administrative regulations. Section 4 also requires the regulations to: (1) include procedural
95 standards that provide interested persons with an opportunity to comment on issues raised in a
96 petition and whether the regulation should be suspended or nullified; and (2) be included in
97 the Nevada Administrative Code.
98 Existing law excludes the application of certain agency policies to a person with
99 sufficient prior actual notice of the policy from the definition of “regulation” for the purposes
100 of the Nevada Administrative Procedure Act. (NRS 233B.038) Section 6 of this bill removes
101 this exception, which has the effect of requiring such policies to be adopted in a regulation
102 under the Nevada Administrative Procedure Act.
103 Existing law ratifies the Nevada Administrative Code as revised or supplemented before
104 May 15, 1987. (NRS 233B.0395) Section 7 of this bill ratifies the Code as revised or
105 supplemented before February 3, 2025.
106 Existing law requires an agency to adopt a proposed regulation not later than 2 years after
107 the proposed regulation is submitted to the Legislative Counsel. (NRS 233B.040) Section 8 of
108 this bill requires an agency to also submit the proposed regulation to the Legislative
109 Commission for review within the same 2-year period.
110 Existing law requires an agency to hold an oral public hearing on a proposed regulation if
111 an oral hearing is requested by certain persons and the proposed regulation is substantive.
112 (NRS 233B.061) Section 9 of this bill eliminates the requirement regarding the
113 substantiveness of the regulation, which has the effect of requiring an oral hearing on all
114 proposed regulations.
115 Under existing law, the Legislative Counsel is required to prepare and publish a Register
116 of Administrative Regulations, which includes information relating to adopted permanent
117 regulations. (NRS 233B.0653) Section 12 of this bill eliminates the requirement that the
118 Legislative Counsel publish paper copies of the Register and instead requires the Legislative
119 Counsel to publish the Register electronically on the public Internet website of the
120 Legislature.
121 An emergency regulation becomes effective when certain documents are filed with the
122 Secretary of State. (NRS 233B.070) Sections 10 and 14 of this bill require a copy of the
123 written statement of the emergency endorsed by the Governor to be included with the
124 information that is required be filed with the Secretary of State before an emergency
125 regulation becomes effective.
126 Existing law authorizes a plaintiff to bring an action for declaratory judgment on an
127 allegation that a regulation, or its proposed application, interferes with or impairs, or threatens
128 to interfere with or impair, the legal rights or privileges of the plaintiff. Under existing law, a
129 court is required to declare the regulation invalid if it finds that the regulation violates
130 constitutional or statutory provisions or exceeds the statutory authority of the agency that
131 adopted the regulation. (NRS 233B.110)
132 In determining whether a regulation violates statutory provisions or exceeds the statutory
133 authority of an agency, the Nevada Supreme Court has held that “courts should not substitute
134 their own construction of a statutory provision for a reasonable interpretation made by an
135 agency.” (Collins Disc. Liquors & Vending v. State, Dep’t of Tax’n, 106 Nev. 766, 768
136 (1990)) The Nevada Supreme Court has also held that “the interpretation by the agency
137 charged with administering a statute is persuasive, and that great deference should be given to
138 that interpretation if it is within the language of the statute.” (Nev. Tax Comm’n v. Nev.
139 Cement Co., 117 Nev. 960, 968-69 (2001))
140 However, because the Nevada Administrative Procedure Act does not include any
141 specific provisions regarding whether any deference should be given to the Legislative
142 Commission’s approval of a regulation, the Nevada Supreme Court has declined to give any
143 deference to the Legislative Commission’s approval of the regulation, even though such
144 approval includes the Legislative Commission’s legal determination that the regulation
145 conforms to the statutory authority pursuant to which it was adopted and carries out the

Senate Amendment No. 485 to Senate Bill No. 340 Page 6
146 Legislature’s intent in granting that authority. (Killebrew v. State ex rel. Donahue, 139 Nev.
147 Adv. Op. No. 43, 535 P.3d 1167, 1173 n.4 (2023) (“The Legislative Commission, as amicus
148 curiae, urges us to give deference to its approval of the regulation and to review whether the
149 regulation is reasonable as a matter of law. We decline the invitation to alter our statutorily
150 mandated review of a regulation.”))
151 Section 16 amends the Nevada Administrative Procedure Act to provide that in any
152 action where the court must determine whether a regulation violates statutory provisions or
153 exceeds the statutory authority of an agency and the Legislative Commission or the
154 Subcommittee to Review Regulations has approved the regulation under the Nevada
155 Administrative Procedure Act, the court: (1) must not substitute its judgment for the legal
156 determination of the Legislative Commission or the Subcommittee to Review Regulations,
157 made through its legislative approval of the regulation, that the regulation conforms to the
158 statutory authority pursuant to which it was adopted and carries out the Legislature’s intent in
159 granting that authority; (2) must make every reasonable effort and indulge in every reasonable
160 presumption to uphold that legislative legal determination and must resolve any ambiguity,
161 uncertainty or doubt against the plaintiff and in favor of that legislative legal determination;
162 and (3) must give great weight and deference to that legislative legal determination and must
163 uphold that legislative legal determination if it is reasonable as a matter of law. Section 13 of
164 this bill makes conforming changes.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. 1. The Legislature hereby finds that:
2 (a) Under the separation-of-powers provision of Section 1 of Article 3 of the
3 Nevada Constitution, one department of the State Government may not exercise
4 powers properly belonging to another department of the State Government except
5 in cases expressly directed or permitted in the Nevada Constitution.
6 (b) In 1996, Nevada’s voters approved a constitutional amendment to the
7 separation-of-powers provision which expressly empowers the Legislature to
8 provide by law for legislative agencies and legislative bodies composed of
9 members of the Senate and Assembly to suspend or nullify regulations adopted by
10 executive agencies on the basis that the regulations exceed the statutory authority of
11 the agencies or are inconsistent with legislative intent.
12 (c) When the constitutional amendment was presented to the voters, the ballot
13 materials explained that its purpose was to ensure that the Legislative Department
14 had the specific constitutional power to suspend or nullify regulations adopted by
15 executive agencies which exceed the statutory authority granted by the Legislature
16 when it passed the laws that authorized the agencies to adopt the regulations.
17 (d) Because Nevada’s voters expressly granted specific constitutional power to
18 the Legislature to provide by law for legislative agencies and legislative bodies
19 composed of members of the Senate and Assembly to suspend or nullify regulations
20 adopted by executive agencies, the other departments may not infringe upon the
21 exercise of that power out of respect for an equal and coordinate department of
22 government.
23 (e) When executive agencies adopt regulations which exceed their statutory
24 authority or are inconsistent with legislative intent, the regulations thwart and
25 undermine the will of the people who, through their elected representatives in the
26 Legislature, determine by properly enacted laws the scope and extent of the
27 authority granted to executive agencies to adopt regulations.
28 (f) When a regulation adopted by an executive agency is alleged to exceed the
29 statutory authority or to be inconsistent with legislative intent, the issue should be
30 resolved by legislative agencies and legislative bodies composed of members of the

Senate Amendment No. 485 to Senate Bill No. 340 Page 7
1 Senate and Assembly under the exclusive power expressly granted by Nevada’s
2 voters to suspend or nullify regulations adopted by executive agencies.
3 2. The Legislature hereby declares that there is a legitimate and compelling
4 need to exercise its expressly granted and specific constitutional power under
5 Section 1 of Article 3 of the Nevada Constitution, in the manner set forth in the
6 provisions of this act, in order to:
7 (a) Provide by law for legislative agencies and legislative bodies composed of
8 members of the Senate and Assembly to suspend or nullify regulations adopted by
9 executive agencies which exceed their statutory authority or are inconsistent with
10 legislative intent; and
11 (b) Protect and safeguard the rights of people against such unlawful and invalid
12 regulations.
13 Sec. 2. Chapter 233B of NRS is hereby amended by adding thereto the
14 provisions set forth as sections 3 and 4 of this act.
15 Sec. 3. 1. [A] In addition to a petition that is required to be submitted
16 pursuant to NRS 233B.110, a person or adopting agency may submit a petition
17 pursuant to this section requesting that the Legislative Commission review
18 whether any permanent or temporary regulation that has been filed with the
19 Secretary of State pursuant to NRS 233B.070 should be suspended or nullified, in
20 whole or in part, based on one or more of the following grounds:
21 (a) The regulation exceeds the statutory authority pursuant to which the
22 regulation was adopted;
23 (b) The regulation does not carry out the intent of the Legislature in granting
24 the statutory authority pursuant to which the regulation was adopted; or
25 (c) The regulation is not being administered or interpreted by the adopting
26 agency in a manner consistent with the stated intent of the agency when adopting
27 the regulation or during the review and approval of the regulation by the

Senate Amendment No. 485 to Senate Bill No. 340 Page 16
1 (a) Amendment or suspension by the Governor pursuant to the provisions of

3 (b) Suspension or nullification by the Legislative Commission pursuant to
4 Section 1 of Article 3 of the Nevada Constitution and NRS 233B.0395 to
5 233B.120, inclusive, and sections 3 and 4 of this act.
6 Sec. 16. NRS 233B.110 is hereby amended to read as follows:
7 233B.110 1. The validity or applicability of any regulation may be
8 determined in a proceeding for a declaratory judgment in the district court in and
9 for Carson City, or in and for the county where the plaintiff resides, when it is
10 alleged that the regulation, or its proposed application, interferes with or impairs, or
11 threatens to interfere with or impair, the legal rights or privileges of the plaintiff. A
12 declaratory judgment may be rendered after the plaintiff has first requested the
13 agency to pass upon the validity of the regulation in question.
14 2. [The] If all or any part of an action for a declaratory judgment filed
15 pursuant to this section relates to whether a regulation violates statutory
16 provisions or exceeds the statutory authority of an agency, the court may enter an
17 order requiring the plaintiff to submit a petition to the Legislature Commission
18 for its review of the regulation pursuant to section 3 of this act. Such a petition
19 must be in the format and contain the information required in subsection 2 of
20 section 3 of this act.
21 3. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2, the court shall declare the
22 regulation invalid if it finds that it violates constitutional or statutory provisions or
23 exceeds the statutory authority of the agency. In any action where the court must
24 determine whether the regulation violates statutory provisions or exceeds the
25 statutory authority of the agency and the Legislative Commission or the
26 Subcommittee to Review Regulations has approved the regulation after reviewing
27 it pursuant to NRS 233B.0633 or 233B.067 to 233B.0681, inclusive, as
28 applicable, the court:
29 (a) Must not substitute its judgment for the legal determination of the
30 Legislative Commission or the Subcommittee to Review Regulations, made
31 through its legislative approval of the regulation, that the regulation conforms to
32 the statutory authority pursuant to which it was adopted and carries out the intent
33 of the Legislature in granting that authority;
34 (b) Must make every reasonable effort and indulge in every reasonable
35 presumption to uphold that legal determination of the Legislative Commission or
36 the Subcommittee to Review Regulations and must resolve any ambiguity,
37 uncertainty or doubt against the plaintiff and in favor of that legal determination
38 of the Legislative Commission or the Subcommittee to Review Regulations; and
39 (c) Must give great weight and deference to that legal determination of the
40 Legislative Commission or the Subcommittee to Review Regulations and must
41 uphold that legal determination if it is reasonable as a matter of law.
42 [3.] 4. The agency whose regulation is made the subject of the action for the
43 declaratory [action shall] judgment must be made a party to the action.
44 [2. 4.] 5. An agency may institute an action for a declaratory judgment to
45 establish the validity of any one or more of its own regulations.
46 [3. 5.] 6. Actions for a declaratory judgment provided for in [subsections 1
47 and 2 shall] this section must be in accordance with the Uniform Declaratory
48 Judgments Act (chapter 30 of NRS), and the Nevada Rules of Civil Procedure.
49 [6.] 7. In all actions under [subsections 1 and 2, the] this section:
50 (a) The plaintiff shall serve a copy of the complaint upon the Attorney
51 General, [who] or a person designated by the Attorney General, at the Office of
52 the Attorney General in Carson City; and
53 (b) The Attorney General is also entitled to be heard.

1 [7.] 8. This section must not be construed to limit the authority of the
2 Legislative Commission to suspend or nullify a regulation pursuant to Section 1
3 of Article 3 of the Nevada Constitution and NRS 233B.0395 to 233B.120,
4 inclusive, and sections 3 and 4 of this act.
5 [8.] 9. As used in this section, “Subcommittee to Review Regulations”
6 means the Subcommittee to Review Regulations appointed pursuant to subsection

8 Sec. 17. The amendatory provisions of sections 11 and 16 of this act apply to
9 any judicial proceedings:
10 1. Commenced on or after July 1, 2025; or
11 2. Commenced before July 1, 2025, if the proceedings are pending or
12 otherwise unresolved on July 1, 2025.
13 Sec. 18. This act becomes effective:
14 1. Upon passage and approval for the purpose of adopting any regulations
15 pursuant to section 4 of this act and performing any other preparatory
16 administrative tasks that are necessary to carry out the provisions of this act; and
