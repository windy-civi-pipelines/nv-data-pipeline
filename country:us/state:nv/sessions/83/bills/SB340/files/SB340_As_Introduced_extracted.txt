administrative regulations in certain circumstances;

administrative regulations in certain circumstances;
revising provisions relating to certain administrative
regulations and procedures; and providing other matters

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under the separation-of-powers provision of the Nevada Constitution, one
2 department of the State Government may not exercise powers properly belonging to
3 another department of the State Government “except in the cases expressly directed
4 or permitted in this constitution.” (Nev. Const. Art. 3, § 1) As a general rule under
5 the separation-of-powers doctrine, because the question of whether a regulation
6 adopted by an executive agency exceeds its statutory authority or is inconsistent
7 with legislative intent presents a question of statutory interpretation, the power to
8 resolve that question of statutory interpretation and determine whether to invalidate
9 or nullify the regulation is usually regarded as judicial power because “it is
10 emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law
11 is.” (Nevadans for Nev. v. Beers, 122 Nev. 930, 943 n.20 (2006) (quoting Marbury
12 v. Madison, 3 U.S. 137, 177-78 (1803)); Berkson v. LePome, 126 Nev. 492, 499
13 (2010) (explaining that “[t]o declare what the law is or has been is judicial power;
14 to declare what the law shall be is legislative.” (quoting 1 Thomas M. Cooley,
15 Constitutional Limitations 191 (8th ed. 1927)); Silver State Elec. Supply Co. v.
16 State ex rel. Dep’t of Tax’n, 123 Nev. 80, 84 (2007) (“appeals involving
17 interpretation of a statute or regulation present questions of law subject to our
18 independent review.”))

19 For example, in applying the separation-of-powers doctrine to the Federal
20 Government and other state governments, courts have found that the separation-of-
21 powers doctrine ordinarily prohibits legislative committees or other legislative
22 bodies from exercising the power to nullify a regulation adopted by an executive
23 agency on the basis that the regulation exceeds the statutory authority of the agency
24 or is inconsistent with legislative intent, unless Congress or the state legislature
25 passes a law that expressly nullifies the regulation or revises or repeals the agency’s
26 statutory authority. (I.N.S. v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 953 n.16 (1983); State v.
27 A.L.I.V.E. Voluntary, 606 P.2d 769, 772-79 (Alaska 1980); Legis. Research
28 Comm’n v. Brown, 664 S.W.2d 907, 917-20 (Ky. 1984); Blank v. Dep’t of Corr.,
29 611 N.W.2d 530, 537-39 (Mich. 2000); General Assembly of N.J. v. Byrne, 448
30 A.2d 438, 443-49 (N.J. 1982); State ex rel. Barker v. Manchin, 279 S.E.2d 622,
31 630-36 (W. Va. 1981))
32 However, in Nevada, the voters in 1996 approved a constitutional amendment
33 to Nevada’s separation-of-powers provision which expressly empowers the
34 Legislature to provide by law for legislative agencies and legislative bodies
35 composed of members of the Senate and Assembly to suspend or nullify
36 regulations adopted by executive agencies on the basis that the regulations exceed
37 the statutory authority of the agencies or are inconsistent with legislative intent. The
38 constitutional amendment provides that if the Legislature authorizes the adoption of
39 regulations by executive agencies which bind persons outside the agencies, the
40 Legislature is authorized to enact laws providing for: (1) the review of such
41 regulations by a legislative agency before their effective date to determine whether
42 each such regulation is within the statutory authority for its adoption; (2) the
43 suspension by a legislative agency of any such regulation which appears to exceed
44 the statutory authority for its adoption until the regulation is reviewed by a
45 legislative body composed of members of the Senate and Assembly; and (3) the
46 nullification of any such regulation by a majority vote of a legislative body
47 composed of members of the Senate and Assembly. (Nev. Const. Art. 3, § 1) When
48 the constitutional amendment was presented to the voters, the ballot materials
49 explained that its purpose was to ensure that the Legislative Department had the
50 specific constitutional power to suspend or nullify regulations adopted by executive
51 agencies which exceed the statutory authority granted by the Legislature when it
52 passed the laws that authorized the agencies to adopt the regulations. (State of
53 Nevada Ballot Questions 1996, Question No. 5, at pp. 1-2 (Nev. Sec’y of State
54 1996))
55 When the Nevada Constitution expressly grants specific powers to the
56 Legislative Department, the other departments may not infringe upon the exercise
57 of those powers out of respect for an equal and coordinate department of
58 government. (Heller v. Legislature, 120 Nev. 456, 466-72 (2004); Comm’n on
59 Ethics v. Hardy, 125 Nev. 285, 291-94 (2009)) For example, the Nevada Supreme
60 Court has determined that because the Nevada Constitution expressly grants to each
61 legislative House the specific power to “judge” the qualifications, returns and
62 elections of its own members, the constitutional assignment of that power to the
63 Legislative Department “insulates a legislator’s qualifications to hold office from
64 judicial review. In other words, a legislative body’s decision to admit or expel a
65 member is almost unreviewable by the courts.” (Heller v. Legislature, 120 Nev.
66 456, 466-67 (2004)) Because Nevada’s voters expressly granted specific
67 constitutional power to the Legislature to provide by law for legislative agencies
68 and legislative bodies composed of members of the Senate and Assembly to
69 suspend or nullify regulations adopted by executive agencies, the other departments
70 may not infringe upon the exercise of that power out of respect for an equal and
71 coordinate department of government. Section 1 of this bill expresses the
72 Legislature’s findings and declaration regarding its exercise of its expressly granted
73 and specific constitutional power to suspend or nullify such regulations.
-

74 In exercising its expressly granted and specific constitutional power regarding
75 agency regulations, the Legislature has enacted provisions of the Nevada
76 Administrative Procedure Act which set forth the procedures for the adoption of
77 emergency, temporary and permanent regulations by certain executive agencies.
78 (NRS 233B.0395-233B.120) Under existing law, with limited exceptions, the
79 Legislative Commission or the Subcommittee to Review Regulations of the
80 Legislative Commission has the authority to review and to approve or object to
81 certain temporary or permanent regulations before those regulations become
82 effective. (NRS 233B.067-233B.070)
83 Section 3 of this bill authorizes a person to submit a petition requesting the
84 Legislative Commission to review whether a permanent or temporary regulation
85 adopted pursuant to the Nevada Administrative Procedure Act should be suspended
86 or nullified because the regulation: (1) exceeds the statutory authority for its
87 adoption; (2) is inconsistent with the intent of the Legislature in granting the
88 statutory authority for its adoption; or (3) is not being administered or interpreted in
89 a manner that is consistent with the agency’s stated intent when adopting the
90 regulation or the agency’s stated intent during the review and approval of the
91 regulation by the Legislative Commission. Section 3 also: (1) establishes
92 procedures for the review and consideration of such petitions; (2) authorizes the
93 Legislative Commission to suspend or nullify a regulation based on certain grounds
94 raised in such petitions; and (3) requires certain actions to be taken after a
95 suspension or nullification. Additionally, sections 3 and 5 of this bill preclude
96 judicial review of any action taken or determination made by the Legislative
97 Commission in exercising its powers to review, object to, suspend or nullify a
98 regulation. Sections 5, 10, 11, 15 and 16 of this bill make conforming changes
99 relating to the authority of the Legislative Commission to suspend or nullify a
100 regulation.
101 Section 4 of this bill requires the Legislative Commission to adopt such
102 regulations as are necessary to carry out the provisions of the Nevada
103 Administrative Procedure Act governing administrative regulations. Section 4 also
104 requires the regulations to: (1) include procedural standards that provide interested
105 persons with an opportunity to comment on issues raised in a petition and whether
106 the regulation should be suspended or nullified; and (2) be included in the Nevada
107 Administrative Code.
108 Existing law excludes the application of certain agency policies to a person
109 with sufficient prior actual notice of the policy from the definition of “regulation”
110 for the purposes of the Nevada Administrative Procedure Act. (NRS 233B.038)
111 Section 6 of this bill removes this exception, which has the effect of requiring such
112 policies to be adopted in a regulation under the Nevada Administrative Procedure
113 Act.
114 Existing law ratifies the Nevada Administrative Code as revised or
115 supplemented before May 15, 1987. (NRS 233B.0395) Section 7 of this bill ratifies
116 the Code as revised or supplemented before February 3, 2025.
117 Existing law requires an agency to adopt a proposed regulation not later than 2
118 years after the proposed regulation is submitted to the Legislative Counsel. (NRS
119 233B.040) Section 8 of this bill requires an agency to also submit the proposed
120 regulation to the Legislative Commission for review within the same 2-year period.
121 Existing law requires an agency to hold an oral public hearing on a proposed
122 regulation if an oral hearing is requested by certain persons and the proposed
123 regulation is substantive. (NRS 233B.061) Section 9 of this bill eliminates the
124 requirement regarding the substantiveness of the regulation, which has the effect of
125 requiring an oral hearing on all proposed regulations.
126 Under existing law, the Legislative Counsel is required to prepare and publish a
127 Register of Administrative Regulations, which includes information relating to
128 adopted permanent regulations. (NRS 233B.0653) Section 12 of this bill eliminates
-
*SB340*
– 4 –
129 the requirement that the Legislative Counsel publish paper copies of the Register
130 and instead requires the Legislative Counsel to publish the Register electronically
131 on the public Internet website of the Legislature.
132 An emergency regulation becomes effective when certain documents are filed
133 with the Secretary of State. (NRS 233B.070) Sections 10 and 14 of this bill require
134 a copy of the written statement of the emergency endorsed by the Governor to be
135 included with the information that is required be filed with the Secretary of State
136 before an emergency regulation becomes effective.
137 Existing law authorizes a plaintiff to bring an action for declaratory judgment
138 on an allegation that a regulation, or its proposed application, interferes with or
139 impairs, or threatens to interfere with or impair, the legal rights or privileges of the
140 plaintiff. Under existing law, a court is required to declare the regulation invalid if
141 it finds that the regulation violates constitutional or statutory provisions or exceeds
142 the statutory authority of the agency that adopted the regulation. (NRS 233B.110)
143 In determining whether a regulation violates statutory provisions or exceeds the
144 statutory authority of an agency, the Nevada Supreme Court has held that “courts
145 should not substitute their own construction of a statutory provision for a
146 reasonable interpretation made by an agency.” (Collins Disc. Liquors & Vending v.
147 State, Dep’t of Tax’n, 106 Nev. 766, 768 (1990)) The Nevada Supreme Court has
148 also held that “the interpretation by the agency charged with administering a statute
149 is persuasive, and that great deference should be given to that interpretation if it is
150 within the language of the statute.” (Nev. Tax Comm’n v. Nev. Cement Co., 117
151 Nev. 960, 968-69 (2001))
152 However, because the Nevada Administrative Procedure Act does not include
153 any specific provisions regarding whether any deference should be given to the
154 Legislative Commission’s approval of a regulation, the Nevada Supreme Court has
155 declined to give any deference to the Legislative Commission’s approval of the
156 regulation, even though such approval includes the Legislative Commission’s legal
157 determination that the regulation conforms to the statutory authority pursuant to
158 which it was adopted and carries out the Legislature’s intent in granting that
159 authority. (Killebrew v. State ex rel. Donahue, 139 Nev. Adv. Op. No. 43, 535 P.3d
160 1167, 1173 n.4 (2023) (“The Legislative Commission, as amicus curiae, urges us to
161 give deference to its approval of the regulation and to review whether the regulation
162 is reasonable as a matter of law. We decline the invitation to alter our statutorily
163 mandated review of a regulation.”))
164 Section 16 amends the Nevada Administrative Procedure Act to provide that in
165 any action where the court must determine whether a regulation violates statutory
166 provisions or exceeds the statutory authority of an agency and the Legislative
167 Commission or the Subcommittee to Review Regulations has approved the
168 regulation under the Nevada Administrative Procedure Act, the court: (1) must not
169 substitute its judgment for the legal determination of the Legislative Commission or
170 the Subcommittee to Review Regulations, made through its legislative approval of
171 the regulation, that the regulation conforms to the statutory authority pursuant to
172 which it was adopted and carries out the Legislature’s intent in granting that
173 authority; (2) must make every reasonable effort and indulge in every reasonable
174 presumption to uphold that legislative legal determination and must resolve any
175 ambiguity, uncertainty or doubt against the plaintiff and in favor of that legislative
176 legal determination; and (3) must give great weight and deference to that legislative
177 legal determination and must uphold that legislative legal determination if it is
178 reasonable as a matter of law. Section 13 of this bill makes conforming changes.

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. 1. The Legislature hereby finds that:
2 (a) Under the separation-of-powers provision of Section 1 of
3 Article 3 of the Nevada Constitution, one department of the State
4 Government may not exercise powers properly belonging to another
5 department of the State Government except in cases expressly
6 directed or permitted in the Nevada Constitution.
7 (b) In 1996, Nevada’s voters approved a constitutional
8 amendment to the separation-of-powers provision which expressly
9 empowers the Legislature to provide by law for legislative agencies
10 and legislative bodies composed of members of the Senate and
11 Assembly to suspend or nullify regulations adopted by executive
12 agencies on the basis that the regulations exceed the statutory
13 authority of the agencies or are inconsistent with legislative intent.
14 (c) When the constitutional amendment was presented to the
15 voters, the ballot materials explained that its purpose was to ensure
16 that the Legislative Department had the specific constitutional
17 power to suspend or nullify regulations adopted by executive
18 agencies which exceed the statutory authority granted by the
19 Legislature when it passed the laws that authorized the agencies to
20 adopt the regulations.
21 (d) Because Nevada’s voters expressly granted specific
22 constitutional power to the Legislature to provide by law for
23 legislative agencies and legislative bodies composed of members of
24 the Senate and Assembly to suspend or nullify regulations adopted
25 by executive agencies, the other departments may not infringe upon
26 the exercise of that power out of respect for an equal and coordinate
27 department of government.
28 (e) When executive agencies adopt regulations which exceed
29 their statutory authority or are inconsistent with legislative intent,
30 the regulations thwart and undermine the will of the people who,
31 through their elected representatives in the Legislature, determine by
32 properly enacted laws the scope and extent of the authority granted
33 to executive agencies to adopt regulations.
34 (f) When a regulation adopted by an executive agency is alleged
35 to exceed the statutory authority or to be inconsistent with
36 legislative intent, the issue should be resolved by legislative
37 agencies and legislative bodies composed of members of the Senate
38 and Assembly under the exclusive power expressly granted by
39 Nevada’s voters to suspend or nullify regulations adopted by
40 executive agencies.
41 2. The Legislature hereby declares that there is a legitimate and
42 compelling need to exercise its expressly granted and specific
-
*SB340*
– 6 –
1 constitutional power under Section 1 of Article 3 of the Nevada
2 Constitution, in the manner set forth in the provisions of this act, in
3 order to:
4 (a) Provide by law for legislative agencies and legislative bodies
5 composed of members of the Senate and Assembly to suspend or
6 nullify regulations adopted by executive agencies which exceed
7 their statutory authority or are inconsistent with legislative intent;
8 and
9 (b) Protect and safeguard the rights of people against such

15 any permanent or temporary regulation that has been filed with
16 the Secretary of State pursuant to NRS 233B.070 should be
17 suspended or nullified, in whole or in part, based on one or more
18 of the following grounds:
19 (a) The regulation exceeds the statutory authority pursuant to
20 which the regulation was adopted;
21 (b) The regulation does not carry out the intent of the
22 Legislature in granting the statutory authority pursuant to which
23 the regulation was adopted; or
24 (c) The regulation is not being administered or interpreted by
25 the adopting agency in a manner consistent with the stated intent
26 of the agency when adopting the regulation or during the review
27 and approval of the regulation by the Legislative Commission.
28 2. In order to submit a petition pursuant to this section, the
29 person must submit the petition to the Legislative Counsel in a
30 format prescribed by the Legislative Counsel. The petition must

33 meaningful review of whether the regulation should be suspended
34 or nullified based on one or more of the grounds set forth in
35 subsection 1.
36 3. If a petition is properly submitted to the Legislative
37 Counsel, the Chair of the Legislative Commission shall review the
38 petition in consultation with the Legislative Counsel to determine
39 whether to schedule the matter for a meeting of the Legislative
40 Commission.
41 4. The Chair of the Legislative Commission may schedule the

9 regulation should be suspended or nullified based on one or more
10 of the grounds set forth in subsection 1;
11 (b) Does not warrant review by the Legislative Commission
12 because it contains substantially the same or similar allegations or

14 submitted pursuant to this section; or
15 (c) Does not warrant review by the Legislative Commission for
16 any other reason.
17 6. If the Chair of the Legislative Commission declines to

33 paragraph:
34 (1) Must include sufficient information to allow the person
35 submitting the petition and the adopting agency to prepare for the
36 initial meeting.
37 (2) Does not preclude the Legislative Commission from

40 or nullification of the regulation.
41 8. At the initial meeting to review the petition, the Chair of
42 the Legislative Commission shall provide the person submitting
43 the petition and the adopting agency with an opportunity to

-
*SB340*
– 8 –
1 the regulation should be suspended or nullified, subject to any
2 reasonable requirements and restrictions on such presentations.
3 9. At the initial or any subsequent meeting to review the
4 petition, the Legislative Commission may suspend or nullify the
5 regulation, in whole or in part, if the Legislative Commission
6 determines that the regulation:
7 (a) Exceeds the statutory authority pursuant to which the
8 regulation was adopted;
9 (b) Does not carry out the intent of the Legislature in granting
10 the statutory authority pursuant to which the regulation was

13 agency in a manner consistent with the stated intent of the agency
14 when adopting the regulation or during the review and approval of
15 the regulation by the Legislative Commission.
16 10. If the Legislative Commission takes action to suspend or
17 nullify a regulation, in whole or in part, pursuant to this section,
18 the Legislative Counsel shall, as soon as practicable after such
19 action, provide the Secretary of State and the adopting agency
20 with written notice of:

29 regulation pursuant to this section:
30 (a) The Legislative Counsel shall remove the nullified
31 regulation or part of the regulation from the Nevada
32 Administrative Code; and
33 (b) The adopting agency shall remove the nullified regulation
34 or part of the regulation from any agency publications, notices or
35 other documents made available to the public or provided to
36 persons regulated by the agency.
37 12. Any action taken or determination made by the
38 Legislative Commission or the Chair of the Legislative

41 regulation, in whole or in part, is final and is not subject to
42 judicial review.
43 13. As used in this section, “adopting agency” means the

1 Sec. 4. 1. The Legislative Commission shall adopt such
2 regulations as are necessary to carry out the provisions of this

4 of this act. The Legislative Commission’s adoption of such
5 regulations is exempted from the requirements of this chapter and
6 is final and is not subject to judicial review.
7 2. For meetings of the Legislative Commission relating to a
8 petition requesting the suspension or nullification of a regulation

15 reasonable requirements and restrictions on such presentations.
16 3. The Legislative Counsel shall include the regulations

25 review of both functions, except as to those agencies expressly
26 exempted pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.
27 (b) The exercise by the Legislative Commission of the power to

30 233B.0395 to 233B.120, inclusive, and sections 3 and 4 of this act,
31 except that the exercise of such a power by the Legislative
32 Commission is final and not subject to judicial review.
33 2. This chapter confers no additional regulation-making
34 authority upon any agency except to the extent provided in
35 subsection 1 of NRS 233B.050.
36 [2.] 3. The provisions of this chapter are intended to

1 (b) A proposed regulation;
2 (c) The amendment or repeal of a prior regulation; and

24 violates constitutional or statutory provisions or exceeds the
25 statutory authority of the agency. In any action where the court

27 provisions or exceeds the statutory authority of the agency and the
28 Legislative Commission or the Subcommittee to Review
29 Regulations has approved the regulation after reviewing it

43 Legislative Commission or the Subcommittee to Review
44 Regulations; and

6 for the declaratory [action shall] judgment must be made a party to
7 the action.
8 [2.] 4. An agency may institute an action for declaratory

18 General, at the Office of the Attorney General in Carson City; and

S.B. 340
SENATE BILL NO. 340–SENATOR DALY
MARCH 12, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Government Affairs
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to governmental
administration. (BDR 18-1008)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to governmental administration; authorizing the
Legislative Commission to suspend or nullify certain
administrative regulations in certain circumstances;
revising provisions relating to judicial review of certain
administrative regulations in certain circumstances;
revising provisions relating to certain administrative
regulations and procedures; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under the separation-of-powers provision of the Nevada Constitution, one
2 department of the State Government may not exercise powers properly belonging to
3 another department of the State Government “except in the cases expressly directed
4 or permitted in this constitution.” (Nev. Const. Art. 3, § 1) As a general rule under
5 the separation-of-powers doctrine, because the question of whether a regulation
6 adopted by an executive agency exceeds its statutory authority or is inconsistent
7 with legislative intent presents a question of statutory interpretation, the power to
8 resolve that question of statutory interpretation and determine whether to invalidate
9 or nullify the regulation is usually regarded as judicial power because “it is
10 emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law
11 is.” (Nevadans for Nev. v. Beers, 122 Nev. 930, 943 n.20 (2006) (quoting Marbury
12 v. Madison, 3 U.S. 137, 177-78 (1803)); Berkson v. LePome, 126 Nev. 492, 499
13 (2010) (explaining that “[t]o declare what the law is or has been is judicial power;
14 to declare what the law shall be is legislative.” (quoting 1 Thomas M. Cooley,
15 Constitutional Limitations 191 (8th ed. 1927)); Silver State Elec. Supply Co. v.
16 State ex rel. Dep’t of Tax’n, 123 Nev. 80, 84 (2007) (“appeals involving
17 interpretation of a statute or regulation present questions of law subject to our
18 independent review.”))

19 For example, in applying the separation-of-powers doctrine to the Federal
20 Government and other state governments, courts have found that the separation-of-
21 powers doctrine ordinarily prohibits legislative committees or other legislative
22 bodies from exercising the power to nullify a regulation adopted by an executive
23 agency on the basis that the regulation exceeds the statutory authority of the agency
24 or is inconsistent with legislative intent, unless Congress or the state legislature
25 passes a law that expressly nullifies the regulation or revises or repeals the agency’s
26 statutory authority. (I.N.S. v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 953 n.16 (1983); State v.
27 A.L.I.V.E. Voluntary, 606 P.2d 769, 772-79 (Alaska 1980); Legis. Research
28 Comm’n v. Brown, 664 S.W.2d 907, 917-20 (Ky. 1984); Blank v. Dep’t of Corr.,
29 611 N.W.2d 530, 537-39 (Mich. 2000); General Assembly of N.J. v. Byrne, 448
30 A.2d 438, 443-49 (N.J. 1982); State ex rel. Barker v. Manchin, 279 S.E.2d 622,
31 630-36 (W. Va. 1981))
32 However, in Nevada, the voters in 1996 approved a constitutional amendment
33 to Nevada’s separation-of-powers provision which expressly empowers the
34 Legislature to provide by law for legislative agencies and legislative bodies
35 composed of members of the Senate and Assembly to suspend or nullify
36 regulations adopted by executive agencies on the basis that the regulations exceed
37 the statutory authority of the agencies or are inconsistent with legislative intent. The
38 constitutional amendment provides that if the Legislature authorizes the adoption of
39 regulations by executive agencies which bind persons outside the agencies, the
40 Legislature is authorized to enact laws providing for: (1) the review of such
41 regulations by a legislative agency before their effective date to determine whether
42 each such regulation is within the statutory authority for its adoption; (2) the
43 suspension by a legislative agency of any such regulation which appears to exceed
44 the statutory authority for its adoption until the regulation is reviewed by a
45 legislative body composed of members of the Senate and Assembly; and (3) the
46 nullification of any such regulation by a majority vote of a legislative body
47 composed of members of the Senate and Assembly. (Nev. Const. Art. 3, § 1) When
48 the constitutional amendment was presented to the voters, the ballot materials
49 explained that its purpose was to ensure that the Legislative Department had the
50 specific constitutional power to suspend or nullify regulations adopted by executive
51 agencies which exceed the statutory authority granted by the Legislature when it
52 passed the laws that authorized the agencies to adopt the regulations. (State of
53 Nevada Ballot Questions 1996, Question No. 5, at pp. 1-2 (Nev. Sec’y of State
54 1996))
55 When the Nevada Constitution expressly grants specific powers to the
56 Legislative Department, the other departments may not infringe upon the exercise
57 of those powers out of respect for an equal and coordinate department of
58 government. (Heller v. Legislature, 120 Nev. 456, 466-72 (2004); Comm’n on
59 Ethics v. Hardy, 125 Nev. 285, 291-94 (2009)) For example, the Nevada Supreme
60 Court has determined that because the Nevada Constitution expressly grants to each
61 legislative House the specific power to “judge” the qualifications, returns and
62 elections of its own members, the constitutional assignment of that power to the
63 Legislative Department “insulates a legislator’s qualifications to hold office from
64 judicial review. In other words, a legislative body’s decision to admit or expel a
65 member is almost unreviewable by the courts.” (Heller v. Legislature, 120 Nev.
66 456, 466-67 (2004)) Because Nevada’s voters expressly granted specific
67 constitutional power to the Legislature to provide by law for legislative agencies
68 and legislative bodies composed of members of the Senate and Assembly to
69 suspend or nullify regulations adopted by executive agencies, the other departments
70 may not infringe upon the exercise of that power out of respect for an equal and
71 coordinate department of government. Section 1 of this bill expresses the
72 Legislature’s findings and declaration regarding its exercise of its expressly granted
73 and specific constitutional power to suspend or nullify such regulations.
-
*SB340*

– 3 –
74 In exercising its expressly granted and specific constitutional power regarding
75 agency regulations, the Legislature has enacted provisions of the Nevada
76 Administrative Procedure Act which set forth the procedures for the adoption of
77 emergency, temporary and permanent regulations by certain executive agencies.
78 (NRS 233B.0395-233B.120) Under existing law, with limited exceptions, the
79 Legislative Commission or the Subcommittee to Review Regulations of the
80 Legislative Commission has the authority to review and to approve or object to
81 certain temporary or permanent regulations before those regulations become
82 effective. (NRS 233B.067-233B.070)
83 Section 3 of this bill authorizes a person to submit a petition requesting the
84 Legislative Commission to review whether a permanent or temporary regulation
85 adopted pursuant to the Nevada Administrative Procedure Act should be suspended
86 or nullified because the regulation: (1) exceeds the statutory authority for its
87 adoption; (2) is inconsistent with the intent of the Legislature in granting the
88 statutory authority for its adoption; or (3) is not being administered or interpreted in
89 a manner that is consistent with the agency’s stated intent when adopting the
90 regulation or the agency’s stated intent during the review and approval of the
91 regulation by the Legislative Commission. Section 3 also: (1) establishes
92 procedures for the review and consideration of such petitions; (2) authorizes the
93 Legislative Commission to suspend or nullify a regulation based on certain grounds
94 raised in such petitions; and (3) requires certain actions to be taken after a
95 suspension or nullification. Additionally, sections 3 and 5 of this bill preclude
96 judicial review of any action taken or determination made by the Legislative
97 Commission in exercising its powers to review, object to, suspend or nullify a
98 regulation. Sections 5, 10, 11, 15 and 16 of this bill make conforming changes
99 relating to the authority of the Legislative Commission to suspend or nullify a
100 regulation.
101 Section 4 of this bill requires the Legislative Commission to adopt such
102 regulations as are necessary to carry out the provisions of the Nevada
103 Administrative Procedure Act governing administrative regulations. Section 4 also
104 requires the regulations to: (1) include procedural standards that provide interested
105 persons with an opportunity to comment on issues raised in a petition and whether
106 the regulation should be suspended or nullified; and (2) be included in the Nevada
107 Administrative Code.
108 Existing law excludes the application of certain agency policies to a person
109 with sufficient prior actual notice of the policy from the definition of “regulation”
110 for the purposes of the Nevada Administrative Procedure Act. (NRS 233B.038)
111 Section 6 of this bill removes this exception, which has the effect of requiring such
112 policies to be adopted in a regulation under the Nevada Administrative Procedure
113 Act.
114 Existing law ratifies the Nevada Administrative Code as revised or
115 supplemented before May 15, 1987. (NRS 233B.0395) Section 7 of this bill ratifies
116 the Code as revised or supplemented before February 3, 2025.
117 Existing law requires an agency to adopt a proposed regulation not later than 2
118 years after the proposed regulation is submitted to the Legislative Counsel. (NRS
119 233B.040) Section 8 of this bill requires an agency to also submit the proposed
120 regulation to the Legislative Commission for review within the same 2-year period.
121 Existing law requires an agency to hold an oral public hearing on a proposed
122 regulation if an oral hearing is requested by certain persons and the proposed
123 regulation is substantive. (NRS 233B.061) Section 9 of this bill eliminates the
124 requirement regarding the substantiveness of the regulation, which has the effect of
125 requiring an oral hearing on all proposed regulations.
126 Under existing law, the Legislative Counsel is required to prepare and publish a
127 Register of Administrative Regulations, which includes information relating to
128 adopted permanent regulations. (NRS 233B.0653) Section 12 of this bill eliminates
-
*SB340*

– 4 –
129 the requirement that the Legislative Counsel publish paper copies of the Register
130 and instead requires the Legislative Counsel to publish the Register electronically
131 on the public Internet website of the Legislature.
132 An emergency regulation becomes effective when certain documents are filed
133 with the Secretary of State. (NRS 233B.070) Sections 10 and 14 of this bill require
134 a copy of the written statement of the emergency endorsed by the Governor to be
135 included with the information that is required be filed with the Secretary of State
136 before an emergency regulation becomes effective.
137 Existing law authorizes a plaintiff to bring an action for declaratory judgment
138 on an allegation that a regulation, or its proposed application, interferes with or
139 impairs, or threatens to interfere with or impair, the legal rights or privileges of the
140 plaintiff. Under existing law, a court is required to declare the regulation invalid if
141 it finds that the regulation violates constitutional or statutory provisions or exceeds
142 the statutory authority of the agency that adopted the regulation. (NRS 233B.110)
143 In determining whether a regulation violates statutory provisions or exceeds the
144 statutory authority of an agency, the Nevada Supreme Court has held that “courts
145 should not substitute their own construction of a statutory provision for a
146 reasonable interpretation made by an agency.” (Collins Disc. Liquors & Vending v.
147 State, Dep’t of Tax’n, 106 Nev. 766, 768 (1990)) The Nevada Supreme Court has
148 also held that “the interpretation by the agency charged with administering a statute
149 is persuasive, and that great deference should be given to that interpretation if it is
150 within the language of the statute.” (Nev. Tax Comm’n v. Nev. Cement Co., 117
151 Nev. 960, 968-69 (2001))
152 However, because the Nevada Administrative Procedure Act does not include
153 any specific provisions regarding whether any deference should be given to the
154 Legislative Commission’s approval of a regulation, the Nevada Supreme Court has
155 declined to give any deference to the Legislative Commission’s approval of the
156 regulation, even though such approval includes the Legislative Commission’s legal
157 determination that the regulation conforms to the statutory authority pursuant to
158 which it was adopted and carries out the Legislature’s intent in granting that
159 authority. (Killebrew v. State ex rel. Donahue, 139 Nev. Adv. Op. No. 43, 535 P.3d
160 1167, 1173 n.4 (2023) (“The Legislative Commission, as amicus curiae, urges us to
161 give deference to its approval of the regulation and to review whether the regulation
162 is reasonable as a matter of law. We decline the invitation to alter our statutorily
163 mandated review of a regulation.”))
164 Section 16 amends the Nevada Administrative Procedure Act to provide that in
165 any action where the court must determine whether a regulation violates statutory
166 provisions or exceeds the statutory authority of an agency and the Legislative
167 Commission or the Subcommittee to Review Regulations has approved the
168 regulation under the Nevada Administrative Procedure Act, the court: (1) must not
169 substitute its judgment for the legal determination of the Legislative Commission or
170 the Subcommittee to Review Regulations, made through its legislative approval of
171 the regulation, that the regulation conforms to the statutory authority pursuant to
172 which it was adopted and carries out the Legislature’s intent in granting that
173 authority; (2) must make every reasonable effort and indulge in every reasonable
174 presumption to uphold that legislative legal determination and must resolve any
175 ambiguity, uncertainty or doubt against the plaintiff and in favor of that legislative
176 legal determination; and (3) must give great weight and deference to that legislative
177 legal determination and must uphold that legislative legal determination if it is
178 reasonable as a matter of law. Section 13 of this bill makes conforming changes.

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. 1. The Legislature hereby finds that:
2 (a) Under the separation-of-powers provision of Section 1 of
3 Article 3 of the Nevada Constitution, one department of the State
4 Government may not exercise powers properly belonging to another
5 department of the State Government except in cases expressly
6 directed or permitted in the Nevada Constitution.
7 (b) In 1996, Nevada’s voters approved a constitutional
8 amendment to the separation-of-powers provision which expressly
9 empowers the Legislature to provide by law for legislative agencies
10 and legislative bodies composed of members of the Senate and
11 Assembly to suspend or nullify regulations adopted by executive
12 agencies on the basis that the regulations exceed the statutory
13 authority of the agencies or are inconsistent with legislative intent.
14 (c) When the constitutional amendment was presented to the
15 voters, the ballot materials explained that its purpose was to ensure
16 that the Legislative Department had the specific constitutional
17 power to suspend or nullify regulations adopted by executive
18 agencies which exceed the statutory authority granted by the
19 Legislature when it passed the laws that authorized the agencies to
20 adopt the regulations.
21 (d) Because Nevada’s voters expressly granted specific
22 constitutional power to the Legislature to provide by law for
23 legislative agencies and legislative bodies composed of members of
24 the Senate and Assembly to suspend or nullify regulations adopted
25 by executive agencies, the other departments may not infringe upon
26 the exercise of that power out of respect for an equal and coordinate
27 department of government.
28 (e) When executive agencies adopt regulations which exceed
29 their statutory authority or are inconsistent with legislative intent,
30 the regulations thwart and undermine the will of the people who,
31 through their elected representatives in the Legislature, determine by
32 properly enacted laws the scope and extent of the authority granted
33 to executive agencies to adopt regulations.
34 (f) When a regulation adopted by an executive agency is alleged
35 to exceed the statutory authority or to be inconsistent with
36 legislative intent, the issue should be resolved by legislative
37 agencies and legislative bodies composed of members of the Senate
38 and Assembly under the exclusive power expressly granted by
39 Nevada’s voters to suspend or nullify regulations adopted by
40 executive agencies.
41 2. The Legislature hereby declares that there is a legitimate and
42 compelling need to exercise its expressly granted and specific
-
*SB340*

– 6 –
1 constitutional power under Section 1 of Article 3 of the Nevada
2 Constitution, in the manner set forth in the provisions of this act, in
3 order to:
4 (a) Provide by law for legislative agencies and legislative bodies
5 composed of members of the Senate and Assembly to suspend or
6 nullify regulations adopted by executive agencies which exceed
7 their statutory authority or are inconsistent with legislative intent;
8 and
9 (b) Protect and safeguard the rights of people against such
10 unlawful and invalid regulations.
11 Sec. 2. Chapter 233B of NRS is hereby amended by adding
12 thereto the provisions set forth as sections 3 and 4 of this act.
13 Sec. 3. 1. A person may submit a petition pursuant to this
14 section requesting that the Legislative Commission review whether
15 any permanent or temporary regulation that has been filed with
16 the Secretary of State pursuant to NRS 233B.070 should be
17 suspended or nullified, in whole or in part, based on one or more
18 of the following grounds:
19 (a) The regulation exceeds the statutory authority pursuant to
20 which the regulation was adopted;
21 (b) The regulation does not carry out the intent of the
22 Legislature in granting the statutory authority pursuant to which
23 the regulation was adopted; or
24 (c) The regulation is not being administered or interpreted by
25 the adopting agency in a manner consistent with the stated intent
26 of the agency when adopting the regulation or during the review
27 and approval of the regulation by the Legislative Commission.
28 2. In order to submit a petition pursuant to this section, the
29 person must submit the petition to the Legislative Counsel in a
30 format prescribed by the Legislative Counsel. The petition must
31 contain sufficient allegations and arguments regarding the issues,
32 including citations to relevant legal authorities, to provide for
33 meaningful review of whether the regulation should be suspended
34 or nullified based on one or more of the grounds set forth in
35 subsection 1.
36 3. If a petition is properly submitted to the Legislative
37 Counsel, the Chair of the Legislative Commission shall review the
38 petition in consultation with the Legislative Counsel to determine
39 whether to schedule the matter for a meeting of the Legislative
40 Commission.
41 4. The Chair of the Legislative Commission may schedule the
42 matter for a meeting of the Legislative Commission if the Chair
43 determines that the petition contains sufficient allegations and
44 arguments regarding the issues, including citations to relevant
45 legal authorities, to provide for meaningful review of whether the
-
*SB340*

– 7 –
1 regulation should be suspended or nullified based on one or more
2 of the grounds set forth in subsection 1.
3 5. The Chair of the Legislative Commission may decline to
4 schedule the matter for a meeting of the Legislative Commission if
5 the Chair determines that the petition:
6 (a) Does not contain sufficient allegations or arguments
7 regarding the issues, including citations to relevant legal
8 authorities, to provide for meaningful review of whether the

3 consideration and disposition. Upon submission of such a petition,
4 the agency shall within 30 days either deny the petition in writing,
5 stating its reasons, or initiate regulation-making proceedings.
6 2. Any regulation of any agency is subject to [amendment] :
7 (a) Amendment or suspension by the Governor pursuant to the
8 provisions of NRS 416.060.
9 (b) Suspension or nullification by the Legislative Commission

12 this act.
13 Sec. 16. NRS 233B.110 is hereby amended to read as follows:
14 233B.110 1. The validity or applicability of any regulation
15 may be determined in a proceeding for a declaratory judgment in the
16 district court in and for Carson City, or in and for the county where
17 the plaintiff resides, when it is alleged that the regulation, or its
18 proposed application, interferes with or impairs, or threatens to
19 interfere with or impair, the legal rights or privileges of the plaintiff.
20 A declaratory judgment may be rendered after the plaintiff has first
21 requested the agency to pass upon the validity of the regulation in
22 question.
23 2. The court shall declare the regulation invalid if it finds that it
24 violates constitutional or statutory provisions or exceeds the
25 statutory authority of the agency. In any action where the court
26 must determine whether the regulation violates statutory
27 provisions or exceeds the statutory authority of the agency and the
28 Legislative Commission or the Subcommittee to Review
29 Regulations has approved the regulation after reviewing it
30 pursuant to NRS 233B.0633 or 233B.067 to 233B.0681, inclusive,
31 as applicable, the court:
32 (a) Must not substitute its judgment for the legal determination
33 of the Legislative Commission or the Subcommittee to Review
34 Regulations, made through its legislative approval of the
35 regulation, that the regulation conforms to the statutory authority
36 pursuant to which it was adopted and carries out the intent of the
37 Legislature in granting that authority;
38 (b) Must make every reasonable effort and indulge in every
39 reasonable presumption to uphold that legal determination of the
40 Legislative Commission or the Subcommittee to Review
41 Regulations and must resolve any ambiguity, uncertainty or doubt
42 against the plaintiff and in favor of that legal determination of the
43 Legislative Commission or the Subcommittee to Review
44 Regulations; and

– 19 –
1 (c) Must give great weight and deference to that legal
2 determination of the Legislative Commission or the Subcommittee
3 to Review Regulations and must uphold that legal determination if
4 it is reasonable as a matter of law.
5 3. The agency whose regulation is made the subject of action
6 for the declaratory [action shall] judgment must be made a party to
7 the action.
8 [2.] 4. An agency may institute an action for declaratory
9 judgment to establish the validity of any one or more of its own
10 regulations.
11 [3.] 5. Actions for declaratory judgment provided for in
12 [subsections 1 and 2 shall] this section must be in accordance with
13 the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act (chapter 30 of NRS), and
14 the Nevada Rules of Civil Procedure.
15 6. In all actions under [subsections 1 and 2, the] this section:
16 (a) The plaintiff shall serve a copy of the complaint upon the
17 Attorney General, [who] or a person designated by the Attorney
18 General, at the Office of the Attorney General in Carson City; and
19 (b) The Attorney General is also entitled to be heard.
20 7. This section must not be construed to limit the authority of
21 the Legislative Commission to suspend or nullify a regulation
22 pursuant to Section 1 of Article 3 of the Nevada Constitution and
23 NRS 233B.0395 to 233B.120, inclusive, and sections 3 and 4 of
24 this act.
25 8. As used in this section, “Subcommittee to Review
26 Regulations” means the Subcommittee to Review Regulations
27 appointed pursuant to subsection 6 of NRS 233B.067.
28 Sec. 17. The amendatory provisions of sections 11 and 16 of
29 this act apply to any judicial proceedings:
30 1. Commenced on or after July 1, 2025; or
31 2. Commenced before July 1, 2025, if the proceedings are
32 pending or otherwise unresolved on July 1, 2025.
33 Sec. 18. This act becomes effective:
34 1. Upon passage and approval for the purpose of adopting any
35 regulations pursuant to section 4 of this act and performing any
36 other preparatory administrative tasks that are necessary to carry out
37 the provisions of this act; and
38 2. On July 1, 2025, for all other purposes.
