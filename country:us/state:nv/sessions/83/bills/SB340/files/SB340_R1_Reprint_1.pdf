administrative regulations in certain circumstances;
revising provisions relating to certain administrative
regulations and procedures; and providing other matters

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under the separation-of-powers provision of the Nevada Constitution, one
2 department of the State Government may not exercise powers properly belonging to
3 another department of the State Government “except in the cases expressly directed
4 or permitted in this constitution.” (Nev. Const. Art. 3, § 1) As a general rule under
5 the separation-of-powers doctrine, because the question of whether a regulation
6 adopted by an executive agency exceeds its statutory authority or is inconsistent
7 with legislative intent presents a question of statutory interpretation, the power to
8 resolve that question of statutory interpretation and determine whether to invalidate
9 or nullify the regulation is usually regarded as judicial power because “it is
10 emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law
11 is.” (Nevadans for Nev. v. Beers, 122 Nev. 930, 943 n.20 (2006) (quoting Marbury
12 v. Madison, 3 U.S. 137, 177-78 (1803)); Berkson v. LePome, 126 Nev. 492, 499
13 (2010) (explaining that “[t]o declare what the law is or has been is judicial power;
14 to declare what the law shall be is legislative.” (quoting 1 Thomas M. Cooley,
15 Constitutional Limitations 191 (8th ed. 1927)); Silver State Elec. Supply Co. v.
16 State ex rel. Dep’t of Tax’n, 123 Nev. 80, 84 (2007) (“appeals involving
17 interpretation of a statute or regulation present questions of law subject to our
18 independent review.”))
19 For example, in applying the separation-of-powers doctrine to the Federal
20 Government and other state governments, courts have found that the separation-of-
-

21 powers doctrine ordinarily prohibits legislative committees or other legislative
22 bodies from exercising the power to nullify a regulation adopted by an executive
23 agency on the basis that the regulation exceeds the statutory authority of the agency
24 or is inconsistent with legislative intent, unless Congress or the state legislature
25 passes a law that expressly nullifies the regulation or revises or repeals the agency’s
26 statutory authority. (I.N.S. v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 953 n.16 (1983); State v.
27 A.L.I.V.E. Voluntary, 606 P.2d 769, 772-79 (Alaska 1980); Legis. Research
28 Comm’n v. Brown, 664 S.W.2d 907, 917-20 (Ky. 1984); Blank v. Dep’t of Corr.,
29 611 N.W.2d 530, 537-39 (Mich. 2000); General Assembly of N.J. v. Byrne, 448
30 A.2d 438, 443-49 (N.J. 1982); State ex rel. Barker v. Manchin, 279 S.E.2d 622,
31 630-36 (W. Va. 1981))
32 However, in Nevada, the voters in 1996 approved a constitutional amendment
33 to Nevada’s separation-of-powers provision which expressly empowers the
34 Legislature to provide by law for legislative agencies and legislative bodies
35 composed of members of the Senate and Assembly to suspend or nullify
36 regulations adopted by executive agencies on the basis that the regulations exceed
37 the statutory authority of the agencies or are inconsistent with legislative intent. The
38 constitutional amendment provides that if the Legislature authorizes the adoption of
39 regulations by executive agencies which bind persons outside the agencies, the
40 Legislature is authorized to enact laws providing for: (1) the review of such
41 regulations by a legislative agency before their effective date to determine whether
42 each such regulation is within the statutory authority for its adoption; (2) the
43 suspension by a legislative agency of any such regulation which appears to exceed
44 the statutory authority for its adoption until the regulation is reviewed by a
45 legislative body composed of members of the Senate and Assembly; and (3) the
46 nullification of any such regulation by a majority vote of a legislative body
47 composed of members of the Senate and Assembly. (Nev. Const. Art. 3, § 1) When
48 the constitutional amendment was presented to the voters, the ballot materials
49 explained that its purpose was to ensure that the Legislative Department had the
50 specific constitutional power to suspend or nullify regulations adopted by executive
51 agencies which exceed the statutory authority granted by the Legislature when it
52 passed the laws that authorized the agencies to adopt the regulations. (State of
53 Nevada Ballot Questions 1996, Question No. 5, at pp. 1-2 (Nev. Sec’y of State
54 1996))
55 When the Nevada Constitution expressly grants specific powers to the
56 Legislative Department, the other departments may not infringe upon the exercise
57 of those powers out of respect for an equal and coordinate department of
58 government. (Heller v. Legislature, 120 Nev. 456, 466-72 (2004); Comm’n on
59 Ethics v. Hardy, 125 Nev. 285, 291-94 (2009)) For example, the Nevada Supreme
60 Court has determined that because the Nevada Constitution expressly grants to each
61 legislative House the specific power to “judge” the qualifications, returns and
62 elections of its own members, the constitutional assignment of that power to the
63 Legislative Department “insulates a legislator’s qualifications to hold office from
64 judicial review. In other words, a legislative body’s decision to admit or expel a
65 member is almost unreviewable by the courts.” (Heller v. Legislature, 120 Nev.
66 456, 466-67 (2004)) Because Nevada’s voters expressly granted specific
67 constitutional power to the Legislature to provide by law for legislative agencies
68 and legislative bodies composed of members of the Senate and Assembly to
69 suspend or nullify regulations adopted by executive agencies, the other departments
70 may not infringe upon the exercise of that power out of respect for an equal and
71 coordinate department of government. Section 1 of this bill expresses the
72 Legislature’s findings and declaration regarding its exercise of its expressly granted
73 and specific constitutional power to suspend or nullify such regulations.
74 In exercising its expressly granted and specific constitutional power regarding
75 agency regulations, the Legislature has enacted provisions of the Nevada
-
*SB340_R1*

– 3 –
76 Administrative Procedure Act which set forth the procedures for the adoption of
77 emergency, temporary and permanent regulations by certain executive agencies.
78 (NRS 233B.0395-233B.120) Under existing law, with limited exceptions, the
79 Legislative Commission or the Subcommittee to Review Regulations of the
80 Legislative Commission has the authority to review and to approve or object to
81 certain temporary or permanent regulations before those regulations become
82 effective. (NRS 233B.067-233B.070)
83 Section 3 of this bill authorizes a person or an executive agency to submit a
84 petition requesting the Legislative Commission to review whether a permanent or
85 temporary regulation adopted pursuant to the Nevada Administrative Procedure Act
86 should be suspended or nullified because the regulation: (1) exceeds the statutory
87 authority for its adoption; (2) is inconsistent with the intent of the Legislature in
88 granting the statutory authority for its adoption; or (3) is not being administered or
89 interpreted in a manner that is consistent with the agency’s stated intent when
90 adopting the regulation or the agency’s stated intent during the review and approval
91 of the regulation by the Legislative Commission. In addition, section 16 of this bill
92 authorizes a court to order the plaintiff in an action for a declaratory judgment to
93 submit a petition to the Legislative Commission pursuant to section 3 if all or any
94 part of the action relates to whether a regulation violates statutory provisions or
95 exceeds the statutory authority of an agency. Section 3: (1) establishes procedures
96 for the review and consideration of such petitions; (2) authorizes the Legislative
97 Commission to suspend or nullify a regulation based on certain grounds raised in
98 such petitions; and (3) requires certain actions to be taken after a suspension or
99 nullification. Additionally, sections 3 and 5 of this bill preclude judicial review of
100 any action taken or determination made by the Legislative Commission in
101 exercising its powers to review, object to, suspend or nullify a regulation. Sections
102 5, 10, 11, 15 and 16 of this bill make conforming changes relating to the authority
103 of the Legislative Commission to suspend or nullify a regulation.
104 Section 4 of this bill requires the Legislative Commission to adopt such
105 regulations as are necessary to carry out the provisions of the Nevada
106 Administrative Procedure Act governing administrative regulations. Section 4 also
107 requires the regulations to: (1) include procedural standards that provide interested
108 persons with an opportunity to comment on issues raised in a petition and whether
109 the regulation should be suspended or nullified; and (2) be included in the Nevada
110 Administrative Code.
111 Existing law excludes the application of certain agency policies to a person
112 with sufficient prior actual notice of the policy from the definition of “regulation”
113 for the purposes of the Nevada Administrative Procedure Act. (NRS 233B.038)
114 Section 6 of this bill removes this exception, which has the effect of requiring such
115 policies to be adopted in a regulation under the Nevada Administrative Procedure
116 Act.
117 Existing law ratifies the Nevada Administrative Code as revised or
118 supplemented before May 15, 1987. (NRS 233B.0395) Section 7 of this bill ratifies
119 the Code as revised or supplemented before February 3, 2025.
120 Existing law requires an agency to adopt a proposed regulation not later than 2
121 years after the proposed regulation is submitted to the Legislative Counsel. (NRS
122 233B.040) Section 8 of this bill requires an agency to also submit the proposed
123 regulation to the Legislative Commission for review within the same 2-year period.
124 Existing law requires an agency to hold an oral public hearing on a proposed
125 regulation if an oral hearing is requested by certain persons and the proposed
126 regulation is substantive. (NRS 233B.061) Section 9 of this bill eliminates the
127 requirement regarding the substantiveness of the regulation, which has the effect of
128 requiring an oral hearing on all proposed regulations.
129 Under existing law, the Legislative Counsel is required to prepare and publish a
130 Register of Administrative Regulations, which includes information relating to
-
*SB340_R1*

– 4 –
131 adopted permanent regulations. (NRS 233B.0653) Section 12 of this bill eliminates
132 the requirement that the Legislative Counsel publish paper copies of the Register
133 and instead requires the Legislative Counsel to publish the Register electronically
134 on the public Internet website of the Legislature.
135 An emergency regulation becomes effective when certain documents are filed
136 with the Secretary of State. (NRS 233B.070) Sections 10 and 14 of this bill require
137 a copy of the written statement of the emergency endorsed by the Governor to be
138 included with the information that is required be filed with the Secretary of State
139 before an emergency regulation becomes effective.
140 Existing law authorizes a plaintiff to bring an action for declaratory judgment
141 on an allegation that a regulation, or its proposed application, interferes with or
142 impairs, or threatens to interfere with or impair, the legal rights or privileges of the
143 plaintiff. Under existing law, a court is required to declare the regulation invalid if
144 it finds that the regulation violates constitutional or statutory provisions or exceeds
145 the statutory authority of the agency that adopted the regulation. (NRS 233B.110)
146 In determining whether a regulation violates statutory provisions or exceeds the
147 statutory authority of an agency, the Nevada Supreme Court has held that “courts
148 should not substitute their own construction of a statutory provision for a
149 reasonable interpretation made by an agency.” (Collins Disc. Liquors & Vending v.
150 State, Dep’t of Tax’n, 106 Nev. 766, 768 (1990)) The Nevada Supreme Court has
151 also held that “the interpretation by the agency charged with administering a statute
152 is persuasive, and that great deference should be given to that interpretation if it is
153 within the language of the statute.” (Nev. Tax Comm’n v. Nev. Cement Co., 117
154 Nev. 960, 968-69 (2001))
155 However, because the Nevada Administrative Procedure Act does not include
156 any specific provisions regarding whether any deference should be given to the
157 Legislative Commission’s approval of a regulation, the Nevada Supreme Court has
158 declined to give any deference to the Legislative Commission’s approval of the
159 regulation, even though such approval includes the Legislative Commission’s legal
160 determination that the regulation conforms to the statutory authority pursuant to
161 which it was adopted and carries out the Legislature’s intent in granting that
162 authority. (Killebrew v. State ex rel. Donahue, 139 Nev. Adv. Op. No. 43, 535 P.3d
163 1167, 1173 n.4 (2023) (“The Legislative Commission, as amicus curiae, urges us to
164 give deference to its approval of the regulation and to review whether the regulation
165 is reasonable as a matter of law. We decline the invitation to alter our statutorily
166 mandated review of a regulation.”))
167 Section 16 amends the Nevada Administrative Procedure Act to provide that in
168 any action where the court must determine whether a regulation violates statutory
169 provisions or exceeds the statutory authority of an agency and the Legislative
170 Commission or the Subcommittee to Review Regulations has approved the
171 regulation under the Nevada Administrative Procedure Act, the court: (1) must not
172 substitute its judgment for the legal determination of the Legislative Commission or
173 the Subcommittee to Review Regulations, made through its legislative approval of
174 the regulation, that the regulation conforms to the statutory authority pursuant to
175 which it was adopted and carries out the Legislature’s intent in granting that
176 authority; (2) must make every reasonable effort and indulge in every reasonable
177 presumption to uphold that legislative legal determination and must resolve any
178 ambiguity, uncertainty or doubt against the plaintiff and in favor of that legislative
179 legal determination; and (3) must give great weight and deference to that legislative
180 legal determination and must uphold that legislative legal determination if it is
181 reasonable as a matter of law. Section 13 of this bill makes conforming changes.

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. 1. The Legislature hereby finds that:
2 (a) Under the separation-of-powers provision of Section 1 of
3 Article 3 of the Nevada Constitution, one department of the State
4 Government may not exercise powers properly belonging to another
5 department of the State Government except in cases expressly
6 directed or permitted in the Nevada Constitution.
7 (b) In 1996, Nevada’s voters approved a constitutional
8 amendment to the separation-of-powers provision which expressly
9 empowers the Legislature to provide by law for legislative agencies
10 and legislative bodies composed of members of the Senate and
11 Assembly to suspend or nullify regulations adopted by executive
12 agencies on the basis that the regulations exceed the statutory
13 authority of the agencies or are inconsistent with legislative intent.
14 (c) When the constitutional amendment was presented to the
15 voters, the ballot materials explained that its purpose was to ensure
16 that the Legislative Department had the specific constitutional
17 power to suspend or nullify regulations adopted by executive
18 agencies which exceed the statutory authority granted by the
19 Legislature when it passed the laws that authorized the agencies to
20 adopt the regulations.
21 (d) Because Nevada’s voters expressly granted specific
22 constitutional power to the Legislature to provide by law for
23 legislative agencies and legislative bodies composed of members of
24 the Senate and Assembly to suspend or nullify regulations adopted
25 by executive agencies, the other departments may not infringe upon
26 the exercise of that power out of respect for an equal and coordinate
27 department of government.
28 (e) When executive agencies adopt regulations which exceed
29 their statutory authority or are inconsistent with legislative intent,
30 the regulations thwart and undermine the will of the people who,
31 through their elected representatives in the Legislature, determine by
32 properly enacted laws the scope and extent of the authority granted
33 to executive agencies to adopt regulations.
34 (f) When a regulation adopted by an executive agency is alleged
35 to exceed the statutory authority or to be inconsistent with
36 legislative intent, the issue should be resolved by legislative
37 agencies and legislative bodies composed of members of the Senate
38 and Assembly under the exclusive power expressly granted by
39 Nevada’s voters to suspend or nullify regulations adopted by
40 executive agencies.
41 2. The Legislature hereby declares that there is a legitimate and
42 compelling need to exercise its expressly granted and specific
-
*SB340_R1*

– 6 –
1 constitutional power under Section 1 of Article 3 of the Nevada
2 Constitution, in the manner set forth in the provisions of this act, in
3 order to:
4 (a) Provide by law for legislative agencies and legislative bodies
5 composed of members of the Senate and Assembly to suspend or
6 nullify regulations adopted by executive agencies which exceed
7 their statutory authority or are inconsistent with legislative intent;
8 and
9 (b) Protect and safeguard the rights of people against such
10 unlawful and invalid regulations.
11 Sec. 2. Chapter 233B of NRS is hereby amended by adding

13 Sec. 3. 1. In addition to a petition that is required to be
14 submitted pursuant to NRS 233B.110, a person or adopting
15 agency may submit a petition pursuant to this section requesting
16 that the Legislative Commission review whether any permanent or
17 temporary regulation that has been filed with the Secretary of
18 State pursuant to NRS 233B.070 should be suspended or nullified,
19 in whole or in part, based on one or more of the following
20 grounds:
21 (a) The regulation exceeds the statutory authority pursuant to
22 which the regulation was adopted;
23 (b) The regulation does not carry out the intent of the
24 Legislature in granting the statutory authority pursuant to which
25 the regulation was adopted; or
26 (c) The regulation is not being administered or interpreted by
27 the adopting agency in a manner consistent with the stated intent
28 of the agency when adopting the regulation or during the review
29 and approval of the regulation by the Legislative Commission.
30 2. In order to submit a petition pursuant to this section, the
31 person or adopting agency must submit the petition to the
32 Legislative Counsel in a format prescribed by the Legislative
33 Counsel. The petition must contain sufficient allegations and
34 arguments regarding the issues, including citations to relevant
35 legal authorities, to provide for meaningful review of whether the
36 regulation should be suspended or nullified based on one or more
37 of the grounds set forth in subsection 1.
38 3. If a petition is properly submitted to the Legislative
39 Counsel, the Chair of the Legislative Commission shall submit the
40 petition to the Subcommittee to Review Regulations. The
41 Subcommittee to Review Regulations shall review the petition in
42 consultation with the Legislative Counsel and make a
43 recommendation to the Chair of the Legislative Commission

2 Subcommittee to Review Regulations pursuant to subsection 3, the
3 Chair of the Legislative Commission may:
4 (a) Schedule the matter for a meeting of the Legislative

16 regulation should be suspended or nullified based on one or more
17 of the grounds set forth in subsection 1;
18 (2) Does not warrant review by the Legislative Commission
19 because it contains substantially the same or similar allegations or
20 arguments regarding the issues presented in previous petitions
21 submitted pursuant to this section; or
22 (3) Does not warrant review by the Legislative Commission
23 for any other reason.
24 5. If the Chair of the Legislative Commission declines to

26 the Legislative Counsel shall provide written notice of the
27 determination to the petitioner.
28 6. If the Chair of the Legislative Commission decides to
29 schedule the matter for one or more meetings of the Legislative
30 Commission, the Legislative Counsel shall, at least 30 days before
31 the initial meeting to review the petition, provide the petitioner
32 and, if the petitioner is not the adopting agency, the adopting
33 agency with written notice of the meeting which includes, without
34 limitation:
35 (a) A copy of the petition submitted pursuant to subsection 1;
36 (b) A copy of the regulation that will be considered at the
37 initial meeting; and

43 petitioner and, if the petitioner is not the adopting agency, the
44 adopting agency to prepare for the initial meeting.
-
*SB340_R1*

– 8 –
1 (2) Does not preclude the Legislative Commission from
2 considering any other issues at the initial or any subsequent
3 meeting to review the petition that could result in the suspension
4 or nullification of the regulation.
5 7. At the initial meeting to review the petition, the Chair of
6 the Legislative Commission shall provide the petitioner and, if the
7 petitioner is not the adopting agency, the adopting agency with an
8 opportunity to present comment on the issues raised in the petition
9 and whether the regulation should be suspended or nullified,
10 subject to any reasonable requirements and restrictions on such
11 presentations.
12 8. At the initial or any subsequent meeting to review the
13 petition, the Legislative Commission may suspend or nullify the
14 regulation, in whole or in part, if the Legislative Commission
15 determines that the regulation:
16 (a) Exceeds the statutory authority pursuant to which the

19 the statutory authority pursuant to which the regulation was
20 adopted; or

22 agency in a manner consistent with the stated intent of the agency
23 when adopting the regulation or during the review and approval of
24 the regulation by the Legislative Commission.
25 9. If the Legislative Commission takes action to suspend or
26 nullify a regulation, in whole or in part, pursuant to this section,
27 the Legislative Counsel shall, as soon as practicable after such
28 action, provide the Secretary of State and the adopting agency
29 with written notice of:
30 (a) The suspension of the regulation or any part of the
31 regulation and when the suspension becomes effective and when it
32 expires; or
33 (b) The nullification of the regulation or any part of the

35 10. As soon as practicable after the Legislative Counsel
36 provides the Secretary of State and the adopting agency with
37 written notice of the nullification of a regulation or any part of the
38 regulation pursuant to this section:
39 (a) The Legislative Counsel shall remove the nullified
