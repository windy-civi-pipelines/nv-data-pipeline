Assembly Bill No. 236–Assemblymembers
D’Silva and Torres-Fossett
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to education; revising provisions governing the
selection of members to certain boards and councils; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Under existing law, the Governor is required to appoint teachers at public
schools to the State Board of Education, the Teachers and Leaders Council of
Nevada and the Statewide Council for the Coordination of the Regional Training
Programs from lists of candidates or nominees submitted by the Nevada State
Education Association. (NRS 385.021, 391.455, 391A.130) Sections 1-3 of this bill
maintain the number of teachers appointed to these committees but instead require
the Governor to appoint teachers from lists of nominees submitted by: (1) the
employee organization representing the plurality of teachers who are employed by a
large school district; and (2) the employee organization representing the plurality of
teachers who are employed by school districts in this State other than a large school
district. Under existing law, a “large school district” is defined as any school
district in this State which has more than 100,000 pupils enrolled in its public
schools (currently only the Clark County School District). (NRS 388G.530)
Existing law requires the Governor to appoint to the Teachers and Leaders
Council of Nevada one school counselor, psychologist, speech-language
pathologist, audiologist or social worker who is licensed as educational personnel.
The Governor is required to appoint this member from a list of nominees submitted
by the Nevada State Education Association. (NRS 391.455) Section 2 instead
requires the Governor to appoint this member from lists of nominees submitted by:
(1) the employee organization representing the plurality of school counselors,
psychologists, speech-language pathologists, audiologists and social workers who
are not administrators and who are employed by a large school district; and (2) the
employee organization representing the plurality of school counselors,
psychologists, speech-language pathologists, audiologists and social workers who
are not administrators and who are employed by school districts other than a large
school district.
