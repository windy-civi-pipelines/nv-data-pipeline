Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, the Governor is required to appoint teachers at public
2 schools to the State Board of Education, the Teachers and Leaders Council of
3 Nevada and the Statewide Council for the Coordination of the Regional Training
4 Programs from lists of candidates or nominees submitted by the Nevada State
5 Education Association. (NRS 385.021, 391.455, 391A.130) Sections 1-3 of this bill
6 maintain the number of teachers appointed to these committees but instead require
7 the Governor to appoint teachers from lists of nominees submitted by: (1) the
8 employee organization representing the plurality of teachers who are employed by a
9 large school district; and (2) the employee organization representing the plurality of
10 teachers who are employed by school districts in this State other than a large school
11 district. Under existing law, a “large school district” is defined as any school
12 district in this State which has more than 100,000 pupils enrolled in its public
13 schools (currently only the Clark County School District). (NRS 388G.530)
14 Existing law requires the Governor to appoint to the Teachers and Leaders
15 Council of Nevada one school counselor, psychologist, speech-language
16 pathologist, audiologist or social worker who is licensed as educational personnel.
17 The Governor is required to appoint this member from a list of nominees submitted
18 by the Nevada State Education Association. (NRS 391.455) Section 2 instead
19 requires the Governor to appoint this member from lists of nominees submitted by:
20 (1) the employee organization representing the plurality of school counselors,
21 psychologists, speech-language pathologists, audiologists and social workers who
22 are not administrators and who are employed by a large school district; and (2) the
23 employee organization representing the plurality of school counselors,
