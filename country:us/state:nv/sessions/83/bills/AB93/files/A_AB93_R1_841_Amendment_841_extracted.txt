EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public employees; revising the definition of “police officer” for
the purposes of certain benefits and exemptions; making an
appropriation; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law defines “police officer” to include various law enforcement officers of this
2 State for the purposes of certain provisions relating to eligibility for benefits under the Nevada
3 Occupational Diseases Act. (NRS 617.135)
4 Section 1 of this bill expands the definition of “police officer” to include: (1) a school
5 police officer employed or appointed by the board of trustees of a school district; (2) a
6 juvenile probation officer; (3) a bailiff or deputy marshal of a municipal court; (4) a marshal
7 or deputy marshal of a city or town; and (5) all category I, II and III peace officers.
8 Furthermore, because various other provisions of the Nevada Revised Statutes reference
9 “police officer” as that term is defined in the Act, this bill makes applicable to all category I,
10 II and III peace officers, school police officers employed or appointed by the board of trustees
11 of a school district, juvenile probation officers, bailiffs and deputy marshals of municipal
12 courts and marshals and deputy marshals of cities or towns: (1) industrial insurance coverage
13 for police officers; (2) exemption from service as grand or trial jurors; (3) compensation for
14 police officers with temporary disabilities; and (4) eligibility for certain programs of group
15 insurance or other medical or hospital service for the surviving spouse or any surviving child
16 of a police officer or firefighter. (NRS 6.020, 281.153, 287.021, 287.0477; chapters 616A-
17 616D of NRS)
18 Section 1.5 of this bill makes an appropriation to the Department of Public Safety
19 for the cost of annual physicals for the Chief Parole and Probation Officer of the
20 Division of Parole and Probation of the Department and the police officers of the Capitol
21 Police Division of the Department.
