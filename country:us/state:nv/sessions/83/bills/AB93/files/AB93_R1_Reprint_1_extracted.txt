EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public employees; revising the definition of
“police officer” for the purposes of certain benefits and
exemptions; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law defines “police officer” to include various law enforcement
2 officers of this State for the purposes of certain provisions relating to eligibility for
3 benefits under the Nevada Occupational Diseases Act. (NRS 617.135)
4 Section 1 of this bill expands the definition of “police officer” to include: (1) a
5 school police officer employed or appointed by the board of trustees of a school
6 district; (2) a juvenile probation officer; (3) a bailiff or deputy marshal of a
7 municipal court; (4) a marshal or deputy marshal of a city or town; and (5) all
8 category I, II and III peace officers. Furthermore, because various other provisions
9 of the Nevada Revised Statutes reference “police officer” as that term is defined in
10 the Act, this bill makes applicable to all category I, II and III peace officers, school
11 police officers employed or appointed by the board of trustees of a school district,
12 juvenile probation officers, bailiffs and deputy marshals of municipal courts and
13 marshals and deputy marshals of cities or towns: (1) industrial insurance coverage
14 for police officers; (2) exemption from service as grand or trial jurors; (3)
