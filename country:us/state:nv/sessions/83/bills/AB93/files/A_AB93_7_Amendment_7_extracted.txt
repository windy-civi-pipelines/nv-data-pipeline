EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public employees; revising the definition of “police officer” for
the purposes of certain benefits and exemptions; [specifying that the
use of certain designations by the Department of Public Safety or a
division or officer of the Department does not exclude certain persons
employed by the Department from the definition of “police officer” for
the purposes of certain benefits and exemptions;] and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law defines “police officer” to include various law enforcement officers of this
2 State for the purposes of certain provisions relating to eligibility for benefits under the Nevada
3 Occupational Diseases Act. (NRS 617.135) [Among the law enforcement officers included in
4 the definition of “police officer” are certain specified employees of the Department of Public
5 Safety. (NRS 617.135) Existing law authorizes the Director of the Department of Public
6 Safety to authorize: (1) the Department to use certain designations to identify itself; and (2)
7 the divisions of the Department and the officers and employees of the Department to use
8 certain designations to identify themselves. (NRS 480.150 ) Section 1 of this bill provides that
9 the use of such a designation does not exclude from the definition of “police officer” any
10 person employed by the Department of Public Safety who is included in the definition of
11 “police officer” under existing law.]
12 Section 1 of this bill [also] expands the definition of “police officer” to include: (1) a
13 school police officer employed or appointed by the board of trustees of a school district; (2) a
14 juvenile probation officer; (3) a bailiff or deputy marshal of a municipal court; (4) a marshal
15 or deputy marshal of a city or town; and (5) all category I , II and III peace officers.
16 Furthermore, because various other provisions of the Nevada Revised Statutes reference
17 “police officer” as that term is defined in the Act, this bill makes applicable to all category I ,
18 II and III peace officers, school police officers employed or appointed by the board of
19 trustees of a school district, juvenile probation officers, bailiffs and deputy marshals of
Assembly Amendment No. 7 to Assembly Bill No. 93 Page 4
20 municipal courts and marshals and deputy marshals of cities or towns: (1) industrial insurance
21 coverage for police officers; (2) exemption from service as grand or trial jurors; (3)
22 compensation for police officers with temporary disabilities; and (4) eligibility for certain
23 programs of group insurance or other medical or hospital service for the surviving spouse or
24 any surviving child of a police officer or firefighter. (NRS 6.020, 281.153, 287.021, 287.0477;
25 chapters 616A-616D of NRS)
