EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public employees; revising the definition of
“police officer” for the purposes of certain benefits and
exemptions; specifying that the use of certain
designations by the Department of Public Safety or a
division or officer of the Department does not exclude
certain persons employed by the Department from the
definition of “police officer” for the purposes of certain
benefits and exemptions; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law defines “police officer” to include various law enforcement
2 officers of this State for the purposes of certain provisions relating to eligibility for
3 benefits under the Nevada Occupational Diseases Act. (NRS 617.135) Among the
4 law enforcement officers included in the definition of “police officer” are certain
5 specified employees of the Department of Public Safety. (NRS 617.135) Existing
6 law authorizes the Director of the Department of Public Safety to authorize: (1) the
7 Department to use certain designations to identify itself; and (2) the divisions of the
8 Department and the officers and employees of the Department to use certain
9 designations to identify themselves. (NRS 480.150) Section 1 of this bill provides
10 that the use of such a designation does not exclude from the definition of “police

11 officer” any person employed by the Department of Public Safety who is included
12 in the definition of “police officer” under existing law.
13 Section 1 of this bill also expands the definition of “police officer” to include:
14 (1) a school police officer employed or appointed by the board of trustees of a
15 school district; (2) a juvenile probation officer; (3) a bailiff or deputy marshal of a
16 municipal court; (4) a marshal or deputy marshal of a city or town; and (5) all
17 category I peace officers. Furthermore, because various other provisions of the
18 Nevada Revised Statutes reference “police officer” as that term is defined in the
19 Act, this bill makes applicable to all category I peace officers, school police officers
20 employed or appointed by the board of trustees of a school district, juvenile
21 probation officers, bailiffs and deputy marshals of municipal courts and marshals
22 and deputy marshals of cities or towns: (1) industrial insurance coverage for police
23 officers; (2) exemption from service as grand or trial jurors; (3) compensation for
24 police officers with temporary disabilities; and (4) eligibility for certain programs
25 of group insurance or other medical or hospital service for the surviving spouse or
26 any surviving child of a police officer or firefighter. (NRS 6.020, 281.153, 287.021,
27 287.0477; chapters 616A-616D of NRS)
