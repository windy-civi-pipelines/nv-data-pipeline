Joint Sponsor: Senator Doñate
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to public employees; revising the definition of
“police officer” for the purposes of certain benefits and
exemptions; making an appropriation; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law defines “police officer” to include various law enforcement
officers of this State for the purposes of certain provisions relating to eligibility for
benefits under the Nevada Occupational Diseases Act. (NRS 617.135)
Section 1 of this bill expands the definition of “police officer” to include: (1) a
school police officer employed or appointed by the board of trustees of a school
district; (2) a juvenile probation officer; (3) a bailiff or deputy marshal of a
municipal court; (4) a marshal or deputy marshal of a city or town; and (5) all
category I, II and III peace officers. Furthermore, because various other provisions
of the Nevada Revised Statutes reference “police officer” as that term is defined in
the Act, this bill makes applicable to all category I, II and III peace officers, school
police officers employed or appointed by the board of trustees of a school district,
juvenile probation officers, bailiffs and deputy marshals of municipal courts and
marshals and deputy marshals of cities or towns: (1) industrial insurance coverage
for police officers; (2) exemption from service as grand or trial jurors; (3)
compensation for police officers with temporary disabilities; and (4) eligibility for
certain programs of group insurance or other medical or hospital service for the
surviving spouse or any surviving child of a police officer or firefighter. (NRS
6.020, 281.153, 287.021, 287.0477; chapters 616A-616D of NRS)
Section 1.5 of this bill makes an appropriation to the Department of Public
Safety for the cost of annual physicals for the Chief Parole and Probation Officer of
the Division of Parole and Probation of the Department and the police officers of
the Capitol Police Division of the Department.
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
