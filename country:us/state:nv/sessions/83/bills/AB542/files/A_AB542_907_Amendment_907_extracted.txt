EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to offenders; [revising requirements relating to] extending the
[provision] reversion date of [certain medical services] the
appropriation made by the 81st Session of the Nevada Legislature
to [women in the custody of] the Department of Corrections [;] for
certain costs related to the Nevada Offender Tracking Information
System; revising provisions governing credits earned by an
offender which reduce the term of imprisonment of the offender;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 [Existing law requires the Department of Corrections to provide a woman who is
2 incarcerated access to certain necessary medical and behavioral health care services. (NRS
3 209.3817) Section 1 of this bill requires that any such access be provided in accordance with
4 community standards of care and national guidelines for the provision of such services.
5 Section 1 also removes specific language requiring this access to include an annual pelvic
6 examination and mammography, thereby requiring the Department to provide a woman who
7 is incarcerated access to pelvic examinations and mammography in accordance with
8 community standards of care and national guidelines for the provision of pelvic examinations
9 and mammography, rather than on an annual basis.]
10 During the 2021 Legislative Session, the Legislature appropriated $1,436,720 to the
11 Department of Corrections for the reintegration of the Offender Sentence Management
12 System into the Nevada Offender Tracking Information System. Any remaining balance
13 of that appropriation was required to be reverted to the State General Fund on or before
14 September 15, 2023. (Chapter 463, Statutes of Nevada 2021, at page 2875) During the
15 2023 Legislative Session, the Legislature extended the reversion date to on or before
16 September 19, 2025. (Section 84 of chapter 209, Statutes of Nevada 2023, at page 1257)
17 Section 2 of this bill extends the reversion date to on or before September 17, 2027.
18 Existing law allows an offender to earn certain credits to reduce his or her sentence
19 of imprisonment. (NRS 209.432-209.453) During the 2023 Legislative Session, the
20 Legislature enacted Senate Bill No. 413, which established a revised method for
21 awarding credits to reduce the sentence of an offender that applied to an offender
22 sentenced to a crime committed: (1) on or after July 1, 2025; or (2) before July 1, 2025, if
Assembly Amendment No. 907 to Assembly Bill No. 542 Page 4
23 the offender elected to be subject to the revised method. (Chapter 394, Statutes of
24 Nevada 2023, at page 2308) Section 7 of this bill delays the implementation of the revised
25 method to July 1, 2026. Under section 3 of this bill, the revised method for awarding
26 credits to reduce the sentence of an offender applies to an offender sentenced to a crime
27 committed: (1) on or after July 1, 2026; or (2) before July 1, 2026, if the offender elects
28 to be subject to the revised method. Section 3 also: (1) permits an offender to earn
29 additional credit for engaging in exceptional meritorious service; (2) requires the
30 Department to provide an offender with certain information before the offender elects to
31 be subject to the revised method; and (3) makes various other changes relating to the
32 revised method. Sections 4–6 make conforming changes to reflect the change of date in
33 section 3.

Referred to Committee on Ways and Means
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to offenders. (BDR [16-1132)] S-1132)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to offenders; [revising requirements relating to] extending the
[provision] reversion date of [certain medical services] the
appropriation made by the 81st Session of the Nevada Legislature
to [women in the custody of] the Department of Corrections [;] for
certain costs related to the Nevada Offender Tracking Information
System; revising provisions governing credits earned by an
offender which reduce the term of imprisonment of the offender;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 [Existing law requires the Department of Corrections to provide a woman who is
2 incarcerated access to certain necessary medical and behavioral health care services. (NRS
3 209.3817) Section 1 of this bill requires that any such access be provided in accordance with
4 community standards of care and national guidelines for the provision of such services.
5 Section 1 also removes specific language requiring this access to include an annual pelvic
6 examination and mammography, thereby requiring the Department to provide a woman who
7 is incarcerated access to pelvic examinations and mammography in accordance with
8 community standards of care and national guidelines for the provision of pelvic examinations
9 and mammography, rather than on an annual basis.]
10 During the 2021 Legislative Session, the Legislature appropriated $1,436,720 to the
11 Department of Corrections for the reintegration of the Offender Sentence Management
12 System into the Nevada Offender Tracking Information System. Any remaining balance
13 of that appropriation was required to be reverted to the State General Fund on or before
14 September 15, 2023. (Chapter 463, Statutes of Nevada 2021, at page 2875) During the
15 2023 Legislative Session, the Legislature extended the reversion date to on or before
16 September 19, 2025. (Section 84 of chapter 209, Statutes of Nevada 2023, at page 1257)
17 Section 2 of this bill extends the reversion date to on or before September 17, 2027.
18 Existing law allows an offender to earn certain credits to reduce his or her sentence
19 of imprisonment. (NRS 209.432-209.453) During the 2023 Legislative Session, the
20 Legislature enacted Senate Bill No. 413, which established a revised method for
21 awarding credits to reduce the sentence of an offender that applied to an offender
22 sentenced to a crime committed: (1) on or after July 1, 2025; or (2) before July 1, 2025, if

Assembly Amendment No. 907 to Assembly Bill No. 542 Page 4
23 the offender elected to be subject to the revised method. (Chapter 394, Statutes of
24 Nevada 2023, at page 2308) Section 7 of this bill delays the implementation of the revised
25 method to July 1, 2026. Under section 3 of this bill, the revised method for awarding
26 credits to reduce the sentence of an offender applies to an offender sentenced to a crime
27 committed: (1) on or after July 1, 2026; or (2) before July 1, 2026, if the offender elects
28 to be subject to the revised method. Section 3 also: (1) permits an offender to earn
29 additional credit for engaging in exceptional meritorious service; (2) requires the
30 Department to provide an offender with certain information before the offender elects to
31 be subject to the revised method; and (3) makes various other changes relating to the
32 revised method. Sections 4–6 make conforming changes to reflect the change of date in
33 section 3.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. [NRS 209.3817 is hereby amended to read as follows:

24 Department with a sufficient supply of feminine hygiene products at no cost. The
25 Department shall provide the woman with a preferred type of feminine hygiene

27 to adjust the supply of feminine hygiene products necessary to constitute a
28 sufficient supply for the needs of the woman.
29 [4.] 5. The Department shall adopt regulations necessary to carry out the
30 provisions of this section.
31 [5.] 6. As used in this section:

33 similar item used during a menstrual cycle.
34 (b) “Mammography” has the meaning ascribed to it in NRS 457.182.] (Deleted
35 by amendment.)
