Legislature to the Department of Corrections for certain

Information System; revising provisions governing credits

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 During the 2021 Legislative Session, the Legislature appropriated $1,436,720
2 to the Department of Corrections for the reintegration of the Offender Sentence
3 Management System into the Nevada Offender Tracking Information System. Any
4 remaining balance of that appropriation was required to be reverted to the State
5 General Fund on or before September 15, 2023. (Chapter 463, Statutes of Nevada
6 2021, at page 2875) During the 2023 Legislative Session, the Legislature extended
7 the reversion date to on or before September 19, 2025. (Section 84 of chapter 209,
8 Statutes of Nevada 2023, at page 1257) Section 2 of this bill extends the reversion
9 date to on or before September 17, 2027.
10 Existing law allows an offender to earn certain credits to reduce his or her
11 sentence of imprisonment. (NRS 209.432-209.453) During the 2023 Legislative
12 Session, the Legislature enacted Senate Bill No. 413, which established a revised
13 method for awarding credits to reduce the sentence of an offender that applied to an
14 offender sentenced to a crime committed: (1) on or after July 1, 2025; or (2) before
15 July 1, 2025, if the offender elected to be subject to the revised method. (Chapter
16 394, Statutes of Nevada 2023, at page 2308) Section 7 of this bill delays the
17 implementation of the revised method to July 1, 2026. Under section 3 of this bill,

19 applies to an offender sentenced to a crime committed: (1) on or after July 1, 2026;
20 or (2) before July 1, 2026, if the offender elects to be subject to the revised method.
21 Section 3 also: (1) permits an offender to earn additional credit for engaging in
22 exceptional meritorious service; (2) requires the Department to provide an offender
23 with certain information before the offender elects to be subject to the revised
24 method; and (3) makes various other changes relating to the revised method.
25 Sections 4-6 make conforming changes to reflect the change of date in section 3.
