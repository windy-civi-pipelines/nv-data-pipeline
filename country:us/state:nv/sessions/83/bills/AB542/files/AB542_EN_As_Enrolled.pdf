Assembly Bill No. 542–Committee on Ways and Means
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to offenders; extending the reversion date of the
appropriation made by the 81st Session of the Nevada
Legislature to the Department of Corrections for certain costs
related to the Nevada Offender Tracking Information System;
revising provisions governing credits earned by an offender
which reduce the term of imprisonment of the offender; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
During the 2021 Legislative Session, the Legislature appropriated $1,436,720
to the Department of Corrections for the reintegration of the Offender Sentence
Management System into the Nevada Offender Tracking Information System. Any
remaining balance of that appropriation was required to be reverted to the State
General Fund on or before September 15, 2023. (Chapter 463, Statutes of Nevada
2021, at page 2875) During the 2023 Legislative Session, the Legislature extended
the reversion date to on or before September 19, 2025. (Section 84 of chapter 209,
Statutes of Nevada 2023, at page 1257) Section 2 of this bill extends the reversion
date to on or before September 17, 2027.
Existing law allows an offender to earn certain credits to reduce his or her
sentence of imprisonment. (NRS 209.432-209.453) During the 2023 Legislative
Session, the Legislature enacted Senate Bill No. 413, which established a revised
method for awarding credits to reduce the sentence of an offender that applied to an
offender sentenced to a crime committed: (1) on or after July 1, 2025; or (2) before
July 1, 2025, if the offender elected to be subject to the revised method. (Chapter
394, Statutes of Nevada 2023, at page 2308) Section 7 of this bill delays the
implementation of the revised method to July 1, 2026. Under section 3 of this bill,
the revised method for awarding credits to reduce the sentence of an offender
applies to an offender sentenced to a crime committed: (1) on or after July 1, 2026;
or (2) before July 1, 2026, if the offender elects to be subject to the revised method.
Section 3 also: (1) permits an offender to earn additional credit for engaging in
exceptional meritorious service; (2) requires the Department to provide an offender
with certain information before the offender elects to be subject to the revised
method; and (3) makes various other changes relating to the revised method.
Sections 4-6 make conforming changes to reflect the change of date in section 3.
