AN ACT relating to insurance; requiring health insurers, pharmacy benefit
managers and the Commissioner of Insurance to prepare certain
reports; expanding the scope of certain provisions relating to pharmacy
benefit managers; prohibiting pharmacy benefit managers from
engaging in certain practices; requiring pharmacy benefit managers to
make certain disclosures; imposing requirements relating to the
compensation of pharmacy benefit managers; revising requirements
relating to the collection of certain medical debt; providing civil and
criminal penalties; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires a pharmacy benefit manager, which is an entity that manages a
2 pharmacy benefits plan, to obtain a certificate of registration as an insurance administrator
3 from the Commissioner of Insurance and comply with the requirements that apply to
4 insurance administrators generally. (NRS 683A.025, 683A.08522-683A.0893) Existing law
5 additionally imposes certain requirements specifically regulating the operation of pharmacy
6 benefit managers. (NRS 683A.171-683A.179) Existing law defines “pharmacy benefits plan”
7 to refer to insurance coverage of prescription drugs. (NRS 683A.175) Section 21 of this bill
8 expands the scope of that definition to also refer to insurance coverage of pharmacist services.
9 Section 21 thereby expands the scope of provisions governing pharmacy benefit managers to
10 also apply to entities that manage such coverage. Sections 3-14 of this bill define certain other
11 terms relevant to pharmacy benefit managers, and section 20 of this bill establishes the
12 applicability of those definitions. Section 15 of this bill prohibits a pharmacy benefit manager
13 that manages a pharmacy benefits plan which provides coverage through a network from
14 requiring a person to use a pharmacy affiliated with the pharmacy benefit manager if there are
15 other, nonaffiliated pharmacies in the network. Section 15 additionally prohibits a pharmacy
16 benefit manager from engaging in certain practices which are intended to steer or have the
17 effect of steering a person towards an affiliated pharmacy instead of a nonaffiliated pharmacy
18 in the network. Section 15 also prohibits a pharmacy benefit manager from discriminating
19 against a nonaffiliated pharmacy.

Assembly Amendment No. 999 to Senate Bill No. 316 Third Reprint Page 4
20 Section 16 of this bill requires a pharmacy benefit manager to disclose to a third party
21 insurer for which the pharmacy benefit manager manages a pharmacy benefits plan: (1) the
22 amounts and types of fees that the pharmacy benefit manager charges the third party insurer
23 for managing the plan or otherwise receives from other entities, including rebates, in
24 connection with managing the plan; and (2) certain information relating to the clinical efficacy
25 and evidence regarding the inclusion or exclusion of certain drugs in a formulary. Section 16
26 additionally requires a pharmacy benefit manager to make certain contracts available for
27 inspection by the Commissioner.
28 Sections 25, 27-32, 35 and 36 of this bill require certain third party insurers to calculate
29 any cost-sharing obligation for a prescription drug assessed against an insured for the
30 prescription drug: (1) based on the net price that the third party insurer or a pharmacy benefit
31 manager with which the insurer has contracted pays for the drug; and (2) at the point-of-sale.
32 Section 26 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner to require a domestic insurer that issues a
33 policy of individual health insurance to a person residing in another state to meet the
34 requirements of section 25 in certain circumstances. Sections 33 and 37 of this bill indicate
35 that the requirements of sections 32 and 36, respectively, are inapplicable to: (1) coverage
36 provided by a managed care organization to recipients of Medicaid because existing law
37 imposes similar requirements of the Medicaid program; and (2) coverage provided by a
38 managed care organization to members of the Public Employees’ Benefits Program. (NRS
39 422.4053) Section 41 of this bill makes the requirements of section 36 inapplicable to
40 coverage provided by the Public Employees’ Benefits Program to its members. Section 34 of
41 this bill authorizes the Commissioner to suspend or revoke the certificate of a health
42 maintenance organization that fails to comply with the requirements of section 32. The
43 Commissioner would also be authorized to take such action against other third party insurers
44 who fail to comply with the requirements of sections 25, 27-32, 35 and 36. (NRS 680A.200)
45 Section 17 of this bill prohibits a pharmacy benefit manager from: (1) unreasonably
46 obstructing or interfering with the ability of a covered person to timely access a prescription
47 drug at certain pharmacies; (2) agreeing to exclusively cover certain drugs; (3) restricting the
48 ability of a nonaffiliated pharmacy to contract with certain entities; and (4) making or
49 disseminating a false or misleading statement or advertisement. Section 24 of this bill
50 additionally prohibits a pharmacy benefit manager from engaging in certain practices while
51 doing business with pharmacies.
52 Section 19 of this bill requires a pharmacy benefit manager to submit to the
53 Commissioner an annual report detailing certain business practices of the pharmacy benefit
54 manager as well as certain information regarding pricing and rebates relating to the
55 prescription drugs administered by the pharmacy benefit manager. Section 1 of this bill
56 requires third party insurers that provide coverage for prescription drugs to submit a similar
57 report to the Commissioner relating to the pricing of prescription drugs. Section 39 of this bill
58 provides for the confidentiality of the information contained in those reports. Sections 1 and
59 19 require the Commissioner to compile, submit to the Legislature and publish on the Internet
60 biennial reports on the impact of the cost of prescription drugs on health insurance premiums
61 in this State and the overall impact of pharmacy benefit managers on the cost of prescription
62 drugs in this State, based on the reports submitted by third party insurers and pharmacy
63 benefit managers, respectively. Additionally, section 18 of this bill requires the Commissioner
64 to publish on the Internet certain consumer complaints made against pharmacy benefit
65 managers.
66 Existing law exempts certain federally regulated insurance coverage of prescription drugs
67 provided by employers for their employees from requirements governing pharmacy benefit
68 managers except where the pharmacy benefit manager is required by contract to comply with
69 those requirements. (NRS 683A.177) Section 22 of this bill provides that such federally
70 regulated coverage provided by employers for their employees is also exempt from the
71 requirements of this bill governing pharmacy benefit managers, unless required by contract to
72 comply with those requirements. Additionally, sections 21.5 and 22 of this bill exempt
73 coverage of prescription drugs provided by the Public Employees’ Benefits Program,
74 insurance plans for local government employees and Medicaid managed care organizations
75 from the requirements of this bill governing pharmacy benefit managers.
76 Existing law provides that a pharmacy benefit manager has an obligation of good faith
77 and fair dealing toward a third party insurer or pharmacy when performing duties pursuant to
78 a contract to which the pharmacy benefit manager is a party. (NRS 683A.178) Section 23 of

Assembly Amendment No. 999 to Senate Bill No. 316 Third Reprint Page 5
79 this bill provides that a pharmacy benefit manager also has a fiduciary duty to persons covered
80 by a third party insurer for which the pharmacy benefit manager provides pharmacy benefit
81 services. Section 23 also: (1) prohibits a pharmacy benefit manager from engaging in an
82 activity that may interfere with the duties and obligations of the pharmacy benefit manager
83 towards third party insurers, pharmacies and covered persons; and (2) authorizes a third party
84 insurer to audit the books and records of a pharmacy benefit manager for certain purposes.
85 Section 18 provides that a pharmacy benefit manager that violates provisions of law
86 governing pharmacy benefit managers, including sections 3-24, is subject to a civil penalty of
87 not less than $1,000 but not more than $7,500 for each violation.
88 Additionally, any violation of sections 3-24 would be a misdemeanor. (NRS 683A.490)
89 If enacted, sections 13-15 of Assembly Bill No. 343 (A.B. 343) of this session will
90 require a hospital to publish certain information about its prices. Section 17 of A.B. 343
91 prohibits a hospital from taking certain action to collect medical debt while the hospital is not
92 in compliance with those requirements or certain similar federal requirements. (45 C.F.R. §§
93 180.40, 180.50, 180.60) Section 41.5 of this bill narrows the applicability of that prohibition
94 to only apply to certain medical debt to which the failure to publish accurate pricing
95 information is directly relevant. Section 41.7 of this bill makes a conforming change to A.B.
96 343 to reflect the revisions made by section 41.5.

11 books and public records of a governmental entity must be open at all times during

34 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
35 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
36 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by means of an
37 electronic medium would:
38 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
39 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential and that
40 cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from information that is not
41 otherwise confidential.
42 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who has legal
43 custody or control of a public record:
44 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the medium that
45 is requested because the officer, employee or agent has already prepared or would
46 prefer to provide the copy in a different medium.
47 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon request, prepare
48 the copy of the public record and shall not require the person who has requested the
