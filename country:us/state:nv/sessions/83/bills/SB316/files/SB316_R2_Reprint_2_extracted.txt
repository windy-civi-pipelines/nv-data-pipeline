AN ACT relating to insurance; requiring health insurers, pharmacy
benefit managers and the Commissioner of Insurance to
prepare certain reports; expanding the scope of certain
provisions relating to pharmacy benefit managers;
prohibiting pharmacy benefit managers from engaging in
certain practices; requiring pharmacy benefit managers to
make certain disclosures; imposing requirements relating
to the compensation of pharmacy benefit managers;
providing civil and criminal penalties; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires a pharmacy benefit manager, which is an entity that
2 manages a pharmacy benefits plan, to obtain a certificate of registration as an
3 insurance administrator from the Commissioner of Insurance and comply with the
4 requirements that apply to insurance administrators generally. (NRS 683A.025,
5 683A.08522-683A.0893) Existing law additionally imposes certain requirements
6 specifically regulating the operation of pharmacy benefit managers. (NRS
7 683A.171-683A.179) Existing law defines “pharmacy benefits plan” to refer to
8 insurance coverage of prescription drugs. (NRS 683A.175) Section 21 of this bill
9 expands the scope of that definition to also refer to insurance coverage of
10 pharmacist services. Section 21 thereby expands the scope of provisions governing
11 pharmacy benefit managers to also apply to entities that manage such coverage.
12 Sections 3-14 of this bill define certain other terms relevant to pharmacy benefit
13 managers, and section 20 of this bill establishes the applicability of those
14 definitions. Section 15 of this bill prohibits a pharmacy benefit manager that
15 manages a pharmacy benefits plan which provides coverage through a network
16 from requiring a person to use a pharmacy affiliated with the pharmacy benefit
-
*SB316_R2*
– 2 –
17 manager if there are other, nonaffiliated pharmacies in the network. Section 15
18 additionally prohibits a pharmacy benefit manager from engaging in certain
19 practices which are intended to steer or have the effect of steering a person towards
20 an affiliated pharmacy instead of a nonaffiliated pharmacy in the network. Section
21 15 also prohibits a pharmacy benefit manager from discriminating against a
22 nonaffiliated pharmacy.
23 Section 16 of this bill requires a pharmacy benefit manager to disclose to a
24 third party insurer for which the pharmacy benefit manager manages a pharmacy
25 benefits plan: (1) the amounts and types of fees that the pharmacy benefit manager
26 charges the third party insurer for managing the plan or otherwise receives from
27 other entities, including rebates, in connection with managing the plan; and (2)
28 certain information relating to the clinical efficacy and evidence regarding the
29 inclusion or exclusion of certain drugs in a formulary. Section 16 additionally
30 requires a pharmacy benefit manager to make certain contracts available for
31 inspection by the Commissioner.
32 Sections 25, 27-32, 35 and 36 of this bill prohibit certain third party insurers
33 from imposing on an insured a cost-sharing obligation for a prescription drug which
34 is greater than the net price that the third party insurer or a pharmacy benefit
35 manager with which the insurer has contracted pays for the drug. Section 26 of this
36 bill authorizes the Commissioner to require a domestic insurer that issues a policy
37 of individual health insurance to a person residing in another state to meet the
38 requirements of section 25 in certain circumstances. Sections 33 and 37 of this bill
39 indicate that the requirements of sections 32 and 36, respectively, are inapplicable
40 to: (1) coverage provided by a managed care organization to recipients of Medicaid
41 because existing law imposes similar requirements of the Medicaid program; and
42 (2) coverage provided by a managed care organization to members of the Public
43 Employees’ Benefits Program. (NRS 422.4053) Section 41 of this bill makes the
44 requirements of section 36 inapplicable to coverage provided by the Public
45 Employees’ Benefits Program to its members. Section 34 of this bill authorizes the
46 Commissioner to suspend or revoke the certificate of a health maintenance
47 organization that fails to comply with the requirements of section 32. The
48 Commissioner would also be authorized to take such action against other third
49 party insurers who fail to comply with the requirements of sections 25, 27-32, 35
50 and 36. (NRS 680A.200)
51 Section 17 of this bill prohibits a pharmacy benefit manager from: (1)
52 unreasonably obstructing or interfering with the ability of a covered person to
53 timely access a prescription drug at certain pharmacies; (2) agreeing to exclusively
54 cover certain drugs; (3) restricting the ability of a nonaffiliated pharmacy to
55 contract with certain entities; and (4) making or disseminating a false or misleading
56 statement or advertisement. Section 24 of this bill additionally prohibits a
57 pharmacy benefit manager from engaging in certain practices while doing business
58 with pharmacies.
59 Section 19 of this bill requires a pharmacy benefit manager to submit to the
60 Commissioner an annual report detailing certain business practices of the pharmacy
61 benefit manager as well as certain information regarding pricing and rebates
62 relating to the prescription drugs administered by the pharmacy benefit manager.
63 Section 1 of this bill requires third party insurers that provide coverage for
64 prescription drugs to submit a similar report to the Commissioner relating to the
65 pricing of prescription drugs. Section 39 of this bill provides for the confidentiality
66 of the information contained in those reports. Sections 1 and 19 require the
67 Commissioner to compile, submit to the Legislature and publish on the Internet
68 biennial reports on the impact of the cost of prescription drugs on health insurance
69 premiums in this State and the overall impact of pharmacy benefit managers on the
70 cost of prescription drugs in this State, based on the reports submitted by third party
71 insurers and pharmacy benefit managers, respectively. Additionally, section 18 of
-
*SB316_R2*
– 3 –
72 this bill requires the Commissioner to publish on the Internet certain consumer
73 complaints made against pharmacy benefit managers.
74 Existing law exempts certain federally regulated insurance coverage of
75 prescription drugs provided by employers for their employees from requirements
76 governing pharmacy benefit managers except where the pharmacy benefit manager
77 is required by contract to comply with those requirements. (NRS 683A.177)
78 Section 22 of this bill provides that such federally regulated coverage provided by
79 employers for their employees is also exempt from the requirements of this bill
80 governing pharmacy benefit managers, unless required by contract to comply with
81 those requirements. Additionally, sections 21.5 and 22 of this bill exempt coverage
82 of prescription drugs provided by the Public Employees’ Benefits Program,
83 insurance plans for local government employees and Medicaid managed care
84 organizations from the requirements of this bill governing pharmacy benefit
85 managers.
86 Existing law provides that a pharmacy benefit manager has an obligation of
87 good faith and fair dealing toward a third party insurer or pharmacy when
88 performing duties pursuant to a contract to which the pharmacy benefit manager is
89 a party. (NRS 683A.178) Section 23 of this bill provides that a pharmacy benefit
90 manager also has a fiduciary duty to persons covered by a third party insurer for
91 which the pharmacy benefit manager provides pharmacy benefit services. Section
92 23 also: (1) prohibits a pharmacy benefit manager from engaging in an activity that
93 may interfere with the duties and obligations of the pharmacy benefit manager
94 towards third party insurers, pharmacies and covered persons; and (2) authorizes a
95 third party insurer to audit the books and records of a pharmacy benefit manager for
96 certain purposes.
97 Section 18 provides that a pharmacy benefit manager that violates provisions of
98 law governing pharmacy benefit managers, including sections 3-24, is subject to a
99 civil penalty of not less than $1,000 but not more than $7,500 for each violation.
100 Additionally, any violation of sections 3-24 would be a misdemeanor.

SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to insurance.
(BDR 57-777)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to insurance; requiring health insurers, pharmacy
benefit managers and the Commissioner of Insurance to
prepare certain reports; expanding the scope of certain
provisions relating to pharmacy benefit managers;
prohibiting pharmacy benefit managers from engaging in
certain practices; requiring pharmacy benefit managers to
make certain disclosures; imposing requirements relating
to the compensation of pharmacy benefit managers;
providing civil and criminal penalties; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires a pharmacy benefit manager, which is an entity that
2 manages a pharmacy benefits plan, to obtain a certificate of registration as an
3 insurance administrator from the Commissioner of Insurance and comply with the
4 requirements that apply to insurance administrators generally. (NRS 683A.025,
5 683A.08522-683A.0893) Existing law additionally imposes certain requirements
6 specifically regulating the operation of pharmacy benefit managers. (NRS
7 683A.171-683A.179) Existing law defines “pharmacy benefits plan” to refer to
8 insurance coverage of prescription drugs. (NRS 683A.175) Section 21 of this bill
9 expands the scope of that definition to also refer to insurance coverage of
10 pharmacist services. Section 21 thereby expands the scope of provisions governing
11 pharmacy benefit managers to also apply to entities that manage such coverage.
12 Sections 3-14 of this bill define certain other terms relevant to pharmacy benefit
13 managers, and section 20 of this bill establishes the applicability of those
14 definitions. Section 15 of this bill prohibits a pharmacy benefit manager that
15 manages a pharmacy benefits plan which provides coverage through a network
16 from requiring a person to use a pharmacy affiliated with the pharmacy benefit
-
*SB316_R2*

– 2 –
17 manager if there are other, nonaffiliated pharmacies in the network. Section 15
18 additionally prohibits a pharmacy benefit manager from engaging in certain
19 practices which are intended to steer or have the effect of steering a person towards
20 an affiliated pharmacy instead of a nonaffiliated pharmacy in the network. Section
21 15 also prohibits a pharmacy benefit manager from discriminating against a
22 nonaffiliated pharmacy.
23 Section 16 of this bill requires a pharmacy benefit manager to disclose to a
24 third party insurer for which the pharmacy benefit manager manages a pharmacy
25 benefits plan: (1) the amounts and types of fees that the pharmacy benefit manager
26 charges the third party insurer for managing the plan or otherwise receives from
27 other entities, including rebates, in connection with managing the plan; and (2)
28 certain information relating to the clinical efficacy and evidence regarding the
29 inclusion or exclusion of certain drugs in a formulary. Section 16 additionally
30 requires a pharmacy benefit manager to make certain contracts available for
31 inspection by the Commissioner.
32 Sections 25, 27-32, 35 and 36 of this bill prohibit certain third party insurers
33 from imposing on an insured a cost-sharing obligation for a prescription drug which
34 is greater than the net price that the third party insurer or a pharmacy benefit
35 manager with which the insurer has contracted pays for the drug. Section 26 of this
36 bill authorizes the Commissioner to require a domestic insurer that issues a policy
37 of individual health insurance to a person residing in another state to meet the
38 requirements of section 25 in certain circumstances. Sections 33 and 37 of this bill
39 indicate that the requirements of sections 32 and 36, respectively, are inapplicable
40 to: (1) coverage provided by a managed care organization to recipients of Medicaid
41 because existing law imposes similar requirements of the Medicaid program; and
42 (2) coverage provided by a managed care organization to members of the Public
43 Employees’ Benefits Program. (NRS 422.4053) Section 41 of this bill makes the
44 requirements of section 36 inapplicable to coverage provided by the Public
45 Employees’ Benefits Program to its members. Section 34 of this bill authorizes the
46 Commissioner to suspend or revoke the certificate of a health maintenance
47 organization that fails to comply with the requirements of section 32. The
48 Commissioner would also be authorized to take such action against other third
49 party insurers who fail to comply with the requirements of sections 25, 27-32, 35
50 and 36. (NRS 680A.200)
51 Section 17 of this bill prohibits a pharmacy benefit manager from: (1)
52 unreasonably obstructing or interfering with the ability of a covered person to
53 timely access a prescription drug at certain pharmacies; (2) agreeing to exclusively
54 cover certain drugs; (3) restricting the ability of a nonaffiliated pharmacy to
55 contract with certain entities; and (4) making or disseminating a false or misleading
56 statement or advertisement. Section 24 of this bill additionally prohibits a
57 pharmacy benefit manager from engaging in certain practices while doing business
58 with pharmacies.
59 Section 19 of this bill requires a pharmacy benefit manager to submit to the
60 Commissioner an annual report detailing certain business practices of the pharmacy
61 benefit manager as well as certain information regarding pricing and rebates
62 relating to the prescription drugs administered by the pharmacy benefit manager.
63 Section 1 of this bill requires third party insurers that provide coverage for
64 prescription drugs to submit a similar report to the Commissioner relating to the
65 pricing of prescription drugs. Section 39 of this bill provides for the confidentiality
66 of the information contained in those reports. Sections 1 and 19 require the
67 Commissioner to compile, submit to the Legislature and publish on the Internet
68 biennial reports on the impact of the cost of prescription drugs on health insurance
69 premiums in this State and the overall impact of pharmacy benefit managers on the
70 cost of prescription drugs in this State, based on the reports submitted by third party
71 insurers and pharmacy benefit managers, respectively. Additionally, section 18 of
-
*SB316_R2*

– 3 –
72 this bill requires the Commissioner to publish on the Internet certain consumer
73 complaints made against pharmacy benefit managers.
74 Existing law exempts certain federally regulated insurance coverage of
75 prescription drugs provided by employers for their employees from requirements
76 governing pharmacy benefit managers except where the pharmacy benefit manager
77 is required by contract to comply with those requirements. (NRS 683A.177)
78 Section 22 of this bill provides that such federally regulated coverage provided by
79 employers for their employees is also exempt from the requirements of this bill
80 governing pharmacy benefit managers, unless required by contract to comply with
81 those requirements. Additionally, sections 21.5 and 22 of this bill exempt coverage
82 of prescription drugs provided by the Public Employees’ Benefits Program,
83 insurance plans for local government employees and Medicaid managed care
84 organizations from the requirements of this bill governing pharmacy benefit
85 managers.
86 Existing law provides that a pharmacy benefit manager has an obligation of
87 good faith and fair dealing toward a third party insurer or pharmacy when
88 performing duties pursuant to a contract to which the pharmacy benefit manager is
89 a party. (NRS 683A.178) Section 23 of this bill provides that a pharmacy benefit
90 manager also has a fiduciary duty to persons covered by a third party insurer for
91 which the pharmacy benefit manager provides pharmacy benefit services. Section
92 23 also: (1) prohibits a pharmacy benefit manager from engaging in an activity that
93 may interfere with the duties and obligations of the pharmacy benefit manager
94 towards third party insurers, pharmacies and covered persons; and (2) authorizes a
95 third party insurer to audit the books and records of a pharmacy benefit manager for
96 certain purposes.
97 Section 18 provides that a pharmacy benefit manager that violates provisions of
98 law governing pharmacy benefit managers, including sections 3-24, is subject to a
99 civil penalty of not less than $1,000 but not more than $7,500 for each violation.
100 Additionally, any violation of sections 3-24 would be a misdemeanor.

SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
