Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires a pharmacy benefit manager, which is an entity that
2 manages a pharmacy benefits plan, to obtain a certificate of registration as an
3 insurance administrator from the Commissioner of Insurance and comply with the
-
*SB316_R1*
– 2 –
4 requirements that apply to insurance administrators generally. (NRS 683A.025,
5 683A.08522-683A.0893) Existing law additionally imposes certain requirements
6 specifically regulating the operation of pharmacy benefit managers. (NRS
7 683A.171-683A.179) Existing law defines “pharmacy benefits plan” to refer to
8 insurance coverage of prescription drugs. (NRS 683A.175) Section 21 of this bill
9 expands the scope of that definition to also refer to insurance coverage of
10 pharmacist services. Section 21 thereby expands the scope of provisions governing
11 pharmacy benefit managers to also apply to entities that manage such coverage.
12 Sections 3-14 of this bill define certain other terms relevant to pharmacy benefit
13 managers, and section 20 of this bill establishes the applicability of those
14 definitions. Section 15 of this bill prohibits a pharmacy benefit manager that
15 manages a pharmacy benefits plan which provides coverage through a network
16 from requiring a person to use a pharmacy affiliated with the pharmacy benefit
17 manager if there are other, nonaffiliated pharmacies in the network. Section 15
18 additionally prohibits a pharmacy benefit manager from engaging in certain
19 practices which are intended or have the effect of steering a person towards an
20 affiliated pharmacy instead of a nonaffiliated pharmacy in the network. Section 15
21 also prohibits a pharmacy benefit manager from discriminating against a
22 nonaffiliated pharmacy.
23 Section 16 of this bill requires a pharmacy benefit manager to disclose to a
24 third party insurer for which the pharmacy benefit manager manages a pharmacy
25 benefits plan: (1) the amounts and types of fees that the pharmacy benefit manager
26 charges the third party insurer for managing the plan or otherwise receives from
27 other entities, including rebates, in connection with managing the plan; and (2)
28 certain information relating to the clinical efficacy and evidence regarding the
29 inclusion or exclusion of certain drugs in a formulary. Section 16 additionally
30 requires a pharmacy benefit manager to make certain contracts available for
31 inspection by the Commissioner.
32 Existing law establishes the basis upon which insurance administrators, which
33 include pharmacy benefit managers, may be compensated for their services. (NRS
34 683A.0883) Section 16.5 of this bill prohibits, as of January 1, 2028, a pharmacy
35 benefit manager from deriving any income from the provision of pharmacy benefit
36 management services other than income derived from administrative fees paid to
37 the pharmacy benefit manager by a third party insurer for the provision of such
38 services pursuant to an agreement that provides for such fees.
39 Existing law authorizes the Department of Health and Human Services to enter
40 into a contract with a pharmacy benefit manager to manage coverage of
41 prescription drugs under the State Plan for Medicaid and the Children’s Health
42 Insurance Program that requires the pharmacy benefit manager to provide to the
43 Department all rebates received for purchasing drugs in relation to those programs.
44 (NRS 422.4053) Section 16.5 imposes similar requirements for pharmacy benefit
45 managers that manage other pharmacy benefits plans. Specifically, section 16.5
46 requires a pharmacy benefit manager to provide: (1) income generated through
47 discounts, fees and other incentives received from a manufacturer or wholesaler in
48 connection with providing pharmacy benefit management services for a third party
49 insurer that provides pharmacy coverage to the third party insurer; and (2) income
50 generated through rebates received from a manufacturer or wholesaler in
51 connection with providing pharmacy benefit management services for a third party
52 insurer to persons covered by the third party insurer. Sections 25, 27-32, 35, 36, 40
53 and 41 of this bill require certain third party insurers that provide coverage for
54 prescription drugs to include, when calculating the cost-sharing obligation or
55 maximum out-of-pocket expense of an insured under certain circumstances, all
56 amounts paid by the insured or another person on behalf of an insured towards the
57 cost of a covered prescription drug. Sections 25, 27-32, 35, 36 and 40 also prohibit
58 third party insurers from imposing on an insured a cost-sharing obligation for a
-
*SB316_R1*
– 3 –
59 prescription drug which is greater than the net amount that the third party insurer
60 pays for the drug. Section 26 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner to require a
61 domestic insurer that issues a policy of individual health insurance to a person
62 residing in another state to meet the requirements of section 25 in certain
63 circumstances. Sections 33 and 37 of this bill indicate that the requirements of
64 sections 32 and 36, respectively, are inapplicable to: (1) coverage provided by a
65 managed care organization to recipients of Medicaid because existing law imposes
66 similar requirements of the Medicaid program; and (2) coverage provided by a
67 managed care organization to members of the Public Employees’ Benefits Program.
68 (NRS 422.4053) Section 41 of this bill makes the requirements of section 36
69 inapplicable to coverage provided by the Public Employees’ Benefits Program to its
70 members. Section 34 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner to suspend or revoke
71 the certificate of a health maintenance organization that fails to comply with the
72 requirements of section 32. The Commissioner would also be authorized to take
73 such action against other third party insurers who fail to comply with the
74 requirements of sections 25, 27-32, 35 and 36. (NRS 680A.200)
75 Section 17 of this bill prohibits a pharmacy benefit manager from: (1)
76 unreasonably obstructing or interfering with the ability of a covered person to
77 timely access a prescription drug at certain pharmacies; (2) agreeing to exclusively
78 cover certain drugs; (3) restricting the ability of a nonaffiliated pharmacy to
79 contract with certain entities; and (4) making or disseminating a false or misleading
80 statement or advertisement. Section 24 of this bill additionally prohibits a
81 pharmacy benefit manager from engaging in certain practices while doing business
82 with pharmacies.
83 Section 19 of this bill requires a pharmacy benefit manager to submit to the
84 Commissioner an annual report detailing certain business practices of the pharmacy
85 benefit manager as well as certain information regarding pricing and rebates
86 relating to the prescription drugs administered by the pharmacy benefit manager.
87 Section 1 of this bill requires third party insurers to submit a similar report to the
88 Commissioner relating to the pricing of prescription drugs. Section 39 of this bill
89 provides for the confidentiality of the information contained in those reports.
90 Sections 1 and 19 require the Commissioner to compile, submit to the Legislature
91 and publish on the Internet biennial reports on the impact of the cost of prescription
92 drugs on health insurance premiums in this State and the overall impact of
93 pharmacy benefit managers on the cost of prescription drugs in this State, based on
94 the reports submitted by third party insurers and pharmacy benefit managers,
95 respectively. Additionally, section 18 of this bill requires the Commissioner to
96 publish on the Internet certain consumer complaints made against pharmacy benefit
97 managers.
98 Existing law exempts certain federally regulated insurance coverage of
99 prescription drugs provided by employers for their employees from requirements
100 governing pharmacy benefit managers except where the pharmacy benefit manager
101 is required by contract to comply with those requirements. (NRS 683A.177)
102 Section 22 of this bill provides that such federally regulated coverage provided by
103 employers for their employees is also exempt from the requirements of this bill
104 governing pharmacy benefit managers, unless required by contract to comply with
105 those requirements. Additionally, sections 21.5 and 22 of this bill exempt coverage
106 of prescription drugs provided by the Public Employees’ Benefits Program and
107 Medicaid managed care organizations from the requirements of this bill governing
108 pharmacy benefit managers.
109 Existing law provides that a pharmacy benefit manager has an obligation of
110 good faith and fair dealing toward a third party insurer or pharmacy when
111 performing duties pursuant to a contract to which the pharmacy benefit manager is
112 a party. (NRS 683A.178) Section 23 of this bill provides that a pharmacy benefit
113 manager also has a fiduciary duty to persons covered by a third party insurer for
-
*SB316_R1*
– 4 –
114 which the pharmacy benefit manager provides pharmacy benefit services. Section
115 23 also: (1) prohibits a pharmacy benefit manager from engaging in an activity that
116 may interfere with the duties and obligations of the pharmacy benefit manager
117 towards third party insurers, pharmacies and covered persons; and (2) authorizes a
118 third party insurer to audit the books and records of a pharmacy benefit manager for
119 certain purposes.
120 Section 18 provides that a pharmacy benefit manager that violates provisions of
121 law governing pharmacy benefit managers, including sections 3-24, is subject to a
122 civil penalty of not less than $1,000 but not more than $7,500 for each violation.
123 Existing law defines various activities involving businesses and occupations
124 that constitute deceptive trade practices. (NRS 598.0915-589.0925) If a person
125 engages in a deceptive trade practice, the person may be subject to a civil action
126 brought by certain persons and certain civil and criminal penalties. (NRS 598.0999)
127 Section 18 makes certain violations of sections 15 and 24 a deceptive trade
128 practice, thereby subjecting a violation of those provisions to additional penalties.
129 However, sections 18, 38 and 42 of this bill provide that such violations do not
130 give rise to a private right of action.

2 entity must be open at all times during office hours to inspection by
3 any person, and may be fully copied or an abstract or memorandum
4 may be prepared from those public books and public records. Any
5 such copies, abstracts or memoranda may be used to supply the

24 public record in an electronic format by means of an electronic
25 medium. Nothing in this subsection requires a governmental entity

29 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
30 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
31 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by

35 and that cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from
36 information that is not otherwise confidential.
37 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who
38 has legal custody or control of a public record:

8 (a) Adopt and carry into effect a system of group life, accident
9 or health insurance, or any combination thereof, for the benefit of its
10 officers and employees, and the dependents of officers and
11 employees who elect to accept the insurance and who, where
12 necessary, have authorized the governing body to make deductions
13 from their compensation for the payment of premiums on the
14 insurance.
15 (b) Purchase group policies of life, accident or health insurance,
16 or any combination thereof, for the benefit of such officers and
17 employees, and the dependents of such officers and employees, as
18 have authorized the purchase, from insurance companies authorized
19 to transact the business of such insurance in the State of Nevada,
20 and, where necessary, deduct from the compensation of officers and
21 employees the premiums upon insurance and pay the deductions
22 upon the premiums.
23 (c) Provide group life, accident or health coverage through a
24 self-insurance reserve fund and, where necessary, deduct
25 contributions to the maintenance of the fund from the compensation
26 of officers and employees and pay the deductions into the fund. The
27 money accumulated for this purpose through deductions from the
28 compensation of officers and employees and contributions of the
29 governing body must be maintained as an internal service fund as
30 defined by NRS 354.543. The money must be deposited in a state or
31 national bank or credit union authorized to transact business in the
32 State of Nevada. Any independent administrator of a fund created
33 under this section is subject to the licensing requirements of chapter
34 683A of NRS, and must be a resident of this State. Any contract
35 with an independent administrator must be approved by the
36 Commissioner of Insurance as to the reasonableness of

7 governing the county, school district, municipal corporation,
8 political subdivision, public corporation or other local governmental
9 agency of the State of Nevada.
10 2. If a school district offers group insurance to its officers and
11 employees pursuant to this section, members of the board of trustees
12 of the school district must not be excluded from participating in the
13 group insurance. If the amount of the deductions from compensation
14 required to pay for the group insurance exceeds the compensation to
15 which a trustee is entitled, the difference must be paid by the trustee.
16 3. In any county in which a legal services organization exists,
17 the governing body of the county, or of any school district,
18 municipal corporation, political subdivision, public corporation or
19 other local governmental agency of the State of Nevada in the
20 county, may enter into a contract with the legal services
21 organization pursuant to which the officers and employees of the
22 legal services organization, and the dependents of those officers and
23 employees, are eligible for any life, accident or health insurance
24 provided pursuant to this section to the officers and employees, and
25 the dependents of the officers and employees, of the county, school
26 district, municipal corporation, political subdivision, public
27 corporation or other local governmental agency.
28 4. If a contract is entered into pursuant to subsection 3, the
29 officers and employees of the legal services organization:
30 (a) Shall be deemed, solely for the purposes of this section, to be
31 officers and employees of the county, school district, municipal
32 corporation, political subdivision, public corporation or other local
33 governmental agency with which the legal services organization has
34 contracted; and
35 (b) Must be required by the contract to pay the premiums or

24 practice to recover the actual damages suffered by the elderly person
25 or person with a disability, punitive damages, if appropriate, and
26 reasonable attorney’s fees. The collection of any restitution awarded
27 pursuant to this section has a priority over the collection of any civil

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires a pharmacy benefit manager, which is an entity that
2 manages a pharmacy benefits plan, to obtain a certificate of registration as an
3 insurance administrator from the Commissioner of Insurance and comply with the
-
*SB316_R1*

– 2 –
4 requirements that apply to insurance administrators generally. (NRS 683A.025,
5 683A.08522-683A.0893) Existing law additionally imposes certain requirements
6 specifically regulating the operation of pharmacy benefit managers. (NRS
7 683A.171-683A.179) Existing law defines “pharmacy benefits plan” to refer to
8 insurance coverage of prescription drugs. (NRS 683A.175) Section 21 of this bill
9 expands the scope of that definition to also refer to insurance coverage of
10 pharmacist services. Section 21 thereby expands the scope of provisions governing
11 pharmacy benefit managers to also apply to entities that manage such coverage.
12 Sections 3-14 of this bill define certain other terms relevant to pharmacy benefit
13 managers, and section 20 of this bill establishes the applicability of those
14 definitions. Section 15 of this bill prohibits a pharmacy benefit manager that
15 manages a pharmacy benefits plan which provides coverage through a network
16 from requiring a person to use a pharmacy affiliated with the pharmacy benefit
17 manager if there are other, nonaffiliated pharmacies in the network. Section 15
18 additionally prohibits a pharmacy benefit manager from engaging in certain
19 practices which are intended or have the effect of steering a person towards an
20 affiliated pharmacy instead of a nonaffiliated pharmacy in the network. Section 15
21 also prohibits a pharmacy benefit manager from discriminating against a
22 nonaffiliated pharmacy.
23 Section 16 of this bill requires a pharmacy benefit manager to disclose to a
24 third party insurer for which the pharmacy benefit manager manages a pharmacy
25 benefits plan: (1) the amounts and types of fees that the pharmacy benefit manager
26 charges the third party insurer for managing the plan or otherwise receives from
27 other entities, including rebates, in connection with managing the plan; and (2)
28 certain information relating to the clinical efficacy and evidence regarding the
29 inclusion or exclusion of certain drugs in a formulary. Section 16 additionally
30 requires a pharmacy benefit manager to make certain contracts available for
31 inspection by the Commissioner.
32 Existing law establishes the basis upon which insurance administrators, which
33 include pharmacy benefit managers, may be compensated for their services. (NRS
34 683A.0883) Section 16.5 of this bill prohibits, as of January 1, 2028, a pharmacy
35 benefit manager from deriving any income from the provision of pharmacy benefit
36 management services other than income derived from administrative fees paid to
37 the pharmacy benefit manager by a third party insurer for the provision of such
38 services pursuant to an agreement that provides for such fees.
39 Existing law authorizes the Department of Health and Human Services to enter
40 into a contract with a pharmacy benefit manager to manage coverage of
41 prescription drugs under the State Plan for Medicaid and the Children’s Health
42 Insurance Program that requires the pharmacy benefit manager to provide to the
43 Department all rebates received for purchasing drugs in relation to those programs.
44 (NRS 422.4053) Section 16.5 imposes similar requirements for pharmacy benefit
45 managers that manage other pharmacy benefits plans. Specifically, section 16.5
46 requires a pharmacy benefit manager to provide: (1) income generated through
47 discounts, fees and other incentives received from a manufacturer or wholesaler in
48 connection with providing pharmacy benefit management services for a third party
49 insurer that provides pharmacy coverage to the third party insurer; and (2) income
50 generated through rebates received from a manufacturer or wholesaler in
51 connection with providing pharmacy benefit management services for a third party
52 insurer to persons covered by the third party insurer. Sections 25, 27-32, 35, 36, 40
53 and 41 of this bill require certain third party insurers that provide coverage for
54 prescription drugs to include, when calculating the cost-sharing obligation or
55 maximum out-of-pocket expense of an insured under certain circumstances, all
56 amounts paid by the insured or another person on behalf of an insured towards the
57 cost of a covered prescription drug. Sections 25, 27-32, 35, 36 and 40 also prohibit
58 third party insurers from imposing on an insured a cost-sharing obligation for a
-
*SB316_R1*

– 3 –
59 prescription drug which is greater than the net amount that the third party insurer
60 pays for the drug. Section 26 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner to require a
61 domestic insurer that issues a policy of individual health insurance to a person
62 residing in another state to meet the requirements of section 25 in certain
63 circumstances. Sections 33 and 37 of this bill indicate that the requirements of
64 sections 32 and 36, respectively, are inapplicable to: (1) coverage provided by a
65 managed care organization to recipients of Medicaid because existing law imposes
66 similar requirements of the Medicaid program; and (2) coverage provided by a
67 managed care organization to members of the Public Employees’ Benefits Program.
68 (NRS 422.4053) Section 41 of this bill makes the requirements of section 36
69 inapplicable to coverage provided by the Public Employees’ Benefits Program to its
70 members. Section 34 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner to suspend or revoke
71 the certificate of a health maintenance organization that fails to comply with the
72 requirements of section 32. The Commissioner would also be authorized to take
73 such action against other third party insurers who fail to comply with the
74 requirements of sections 25, 27-32, 35 and 36. (NRS 680A.200)
75 Section 17 of this bill prohibits a pharmacy benefit manager from: (1)
76 unreasonably obstructing or interfering with the ability of a covered person to
77 timely access a prescription drug at certain pharmacies; (2) agreeing to exclusively
78 cover certain drugs; (3) restricting the ability of a nonaffiliated pharmacy to
79 contract with certain entities; and (4) making or disseminating a false or misleading
80 statement or advertisement. Section 24 of this bill additionally prohibits a
81 pharmacy benefit manager from engaging in certain practices while doing business
82 with pharmacies.
83 Section 19 of this bill requires a pharmacy benefit manager to submit to the
84 Commissioner an annual report detailing certain business practices of the pharmacy
85 benefit manager as well as certain information regarding pricing and rebates
86 relating to the prescription drugs administered by the pharmacy benefit manager.
87 Section 1 of this bill requires third party insurers to submit a similar report to the
88 Commissioner relating to the pricing of prescription drugs. Section 39 of this bill
89 provides for the confidentiality of the information contained in those reports.
90 Sections 1 and 19 require the Commissioner to compile, submit to the Legislature
91 and publish on the Internet biennial reports on the impact of the cost of prescription
92 drugs on health insurance premiums in this State and the overall impact of
93 pharmacy benefit managers on the cost of prescription drugs in this State, based on
94 the reports submitted by third party insurers and pharmacy benefit managers,
95 respectively. Additionally, section 18 of this bill requires the Commissioner to
96 publish on the Internet certain consumer complaints made against pharmacy benefit
97 managers.
98 Existing law exempts certain federally regulated insurance coverage of
99 prescription drugs provided by employers for their employees from requirements
100 governing pharmacy benefit managers except where the pharmacy benefit manager
101 is required by contract to comply with those requirements. (NRS 683A.177)
102 Section 22 of this bill provides that such federally regulated coverage provided by
103 employers for their employees is also exempt from the requirements of this bill
104 governing pharmacy benefit managers, unless required by contract to comply with
105 those requirements. Additionally, sections 21.5 and 22 of this bill exempt coverage
106 of prescription drugs provided by the Public Employees’ Benefits Program and
107 Medicaid managed care organizations from the requirements of this bill governing
108 pharmacy benefit managers.
109 Existing law provides that a pharmacy benefit manager has an obligation of
110 good faith and fair dealing toward a third party insurer or pharmacy when
111 performing duties pursuant to a contract to which the pharmacy benefit manager is
112 a party. (NRS 683A.178) Section 23 of this bill provides that a pharmacy benefit
113 manager also has a fiduciary duty to persons covered by a third party insurer for
-
*SB316_R1*

– 4 –
114 which the pharmacy benefit manager provides pharmacy benefit services. Section
115 23 also: (1) prohibits a pharmacy benefit manager from engaging in an activity that
116 may interfere with the duties and obligations of the pharmacy benefit manager
117 towards third party insurers, pharmacies and covered persons; and (2) authorizes a
118 third party insurer to audit the books and records of a pharmacy benefit manager for
119 certain purposes.
120 Section 18 provides that a pharmacy benefit manager that violates provisions of
121 law governing pharmacy benefit managers, including sections 3-24, is subject to a
122 civil penalty of not less than $1,000 but not more than $7,500 for each violation.
123 Existing law defines various activities involving businesses and occupations
124 that constitute deceptive trade practices. (NRS 598.0915-589.0925) If a person
125 engages in a deceptive trade practice, the person may be subject to a civil action
126 brought by certain persons and certain civil and criminal penalties. (NRS 598.0999)
127 Section 18 makes certain violations of sections 15 and 24 a deceptive trade
128 practice, thereby subjecting a violation of those provisions to additional penalties.
129 However, sections 18, 38 and 42 of this bill provide that such violations do not
130 give rise to a private right of action.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 679B of NRS is hereby amended by adding
2 thereto a new section to read as follows:
3 1. On or before June 1 of each year, a health insurer shall
4 compile and submit to the Commissioner a report which contains
5 the following information:
6 (a) Lists of:
7 (1) The 25 prescription drugs most frequently prescribed to
8 insureds in this State during the immediately preceding calendar
9 year;
10 (2) The 25 prescription drugs which accounted for the
11 largest percentage of spending on prescription drugs in this State
12 by the health insurer in the immediately preceding year; and
13 (3) The 25 prescription drugs with the largest increase in
14 the percentage of spending on prescription drugs in this State by
15 the health insurer in the immediately preceding year, as compared
16 to the previous year; and
17 (b) For each prescription drug included on a list compiled
18 pursuant to paragraph (a) for the immediately preceding year:
19 (1) The aggregate wholesale acquisition costs for the drug,
20 calculated by adding together for all units of the drug dispensed to

6 corporation or other local governmental agency of the State of
7 Nevada may:
8 (a) Adopt and carry into effect a system of group life, accident
9 or health insurance, or any combination thereof, for the benefit of its
10 officers and employees, and the dependents of officers and
11 employees who elect to accept the insurance and who, where
12 necessary, have authorized the governing body to make deductions
13 from their compensation for the payment of premiums on the
14 insurance.
15 (b) Purchase group policies of life, accident or health insurance,
16 or any combination thereof, for the benefit of such officers and
17 employees, and the dependents of such officers and employees, as
18 have authorized the purchase, from insurance companies authorized
19 to transact the business of such insurance in the State of Nevada,
20 and, where necessary, deduct from the compensation of officers and
21 employees the premiums upon insurance and pay the deductions
22 upon the premiums.
23 (c) Provide group life, accident or health coverage through a
24 self-insurance reserve fund and, where necessary, deduct
25 contributions to the maintenance of the fund from the compensation
26 of officers and employees and pay the deductions into the fund. The
27 money accumulated for this purpose through deductions from the
28 compensation of officers and employees and contributions of the
29 governing body must be maintained as an internal service fund as
30 defined by NRS 354.543. The money must be deposited in a state or
31 national bank or credit union authorized to transact business in the
32 State of Nevada. Any independent administrator of a fund created
33 under this section is subject to the licensing requirements of chapter
34 683A of NRS, and must be a resident of this State. Any contract
35 with an independent administrator must be approved by the
36 Commissioner of Insurance as to the reasonableness of
37 administrative charges in relation to contributions collected and
38 benefits provided. The provisions of NRS 439.581 to 439.597,

4 (d) Defray part or all of the cost of maintenance of a self-
5 insurance fund or of the premiums upon insurance. The money for
6 contributions must be budgeted for in accordance with the laws
7 governing the county, school district, municipal corporation,
8 political subdivision, public corporation or other local governmental
9 agency of the State of Nevada.
10 2. If a school district offers group insurance to its officers and
11 employees pursuant to this section, members of the board of trustees
12 of the school district must not be excluded from participating in the
13 group insurance. If the amount of the deductions from compensation
14 required to pay for the group insurance exceeds the compensation to
15 which a trustee is entitled, the difference must be paid by the trustee.
16 3. In any county in which a legal services organization exists,
17 the governing body of the county, or of any school district,
18 municipal corporation, political subdivision, public corporation or
19 other local governmental agency of the State of Nevada in the
20 county, may enter into a contract with the legal services
21 organization pursuant to which the officers and employees of the
22 legal services organization, and the dependents of those officers and
23 employees, are eligible for any life, accident or health insurance
24 provided pursuant to this section to the officers and employees, and
25 the dependents of the officers and employees, of the county, school
26 district, municipal corporation, political subdivision, public
27 corporation or other local governmental agency.
28 4. If a contract is entered into pursuant to subsection 3, the
29 officers and employees of the legal services organization:
30 (a) Shall be deemed, solely for the purposes of this section, to be
31 officers and employees of the county, school district, municipal
32 corporation, political subdivision, public corporation or other local
33 governmental agency with which the legal services organization has
34 contracted; and
35 (b) Must be required by the contract to pay the premiums or
36 contributions for all insurance which they elect to accept or of which
37 they authorize the purchase.

24 practice to recover the actual damages suffered by the elderly person
25 or person with a disability, punitive damages, if appropriate, and
26 reasonable attorney’s fees. The collection of any restitution awarded
27 pursuant to this section has a priority over the collection of any civil
28 penalty imposed pursuant to NRS 598.0973.
