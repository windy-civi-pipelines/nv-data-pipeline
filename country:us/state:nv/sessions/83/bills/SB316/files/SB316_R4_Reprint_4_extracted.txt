AN ACT relating to insurance; requiring health insurers, pharmacy
benefit managers and the Commissioner of Insurance to
prepare certain reports; expanding the scope of certain
provisions relating to pharmacy benefit managers;
prohibiting pharmacy benefit managers from engaging in
certain practices; requiring pharmacy benefit managers to
make certain disclosures; imposing requirements relating
to the compensation of pharmacy benefit managers;
revising requirements relating to the collection of certain
medical debt; providing civil and criminal penalties; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires a pharmacy benefit manager, which is an entity that
2 manages a pharmacy benefits plan, to obtain a certificate of registration as an
3 insurance administrator from the Commissioner of Insurance and comply with the
4 requirements that apply to insurance administrators generally. (NRS 683A.025,
5 683A.08522-683A.0893) Existing law additionally imposes certain requirements
6 specifically regulating the operation of pharmacy benefit managers. (NRS
7 683A.171-683A.179) Existing law defines “pharmacy benefits plan” to refer to
8 insurance coverage of prescription drugs. (NRS 683A.175) Section 21 of this bill
9 expands the scope of that definition to also refer to insurance coverage of
10 pharmacist services. Section 21 thereby expands the scope of provisions governing
11 pharmacy benefit managers to also apply to entities that manage such coverage.
12 Sections 3-14 of this bill define certain other terms relevant to pharmacy benefit
-

– 2 –
13 managers, and section 20 of this bill establishes the applicability of those
14 definitions. Section 15 of this bill prohibits a pharmacy benefit manager that
15 manages a pharmacy benefits plan which provides coverage through a network
16 from requiring a person to use a pharmacy affiliated with the pharmacy benefit
17 manager if there are other, nonaffiliated pharmacies in the network. Section 15
18 additionally prohibits a pharmacy benefit manager from engaging in certain
19 practices which are intended to steer or have the effect of steering a person towards
20 an affiliated pharmacy instead of a nonaffiliated pharmacy in the network. Section
21 15 also prohibits a pharmacy benefit manager from discriminating against a
22 nonaffiliated pharmacy.
23 Section 16 of this bill requires a pharmacy benefit manager to disclose to a
24 third party insurer for which the pharmacy benefit manager manages a pharmacy
25 benefits plan: (1) the amounts and types of fees that the pharmacy benefit manager
26 charges the third party insurer for managing the plan or otherwise receives from
27 other entities, including rebates, in connection with managing the plan; and (2)
28 certain information relating to the clinical efficacy and evidence regarding the
29 inclusion or exclusion of certain drugs in a formulary. Section 16 additionally
30 requires a pharmacy benefit manager to make certain contracts available for
31 inspection by the Commissioner.
32 Sections 25, 27-32, 35 and 36 of this bill require certain third party insurers to
33 calculate any cost-sharing obligation for a prescription drug assessed against an
34 insured for the prescription drug: (1) based on the net price that the third party
35 insurer or a pharmacy benefit manager with which the insurer has contracted pays
36 for the drug; and (2) at the point-of-sale. Section 26 of this bill authorizes the
37 Commissioner to require a domestic insurer that issues a policy of individual health
38 insurance to a person residing in another state to meet the requirements of section
39 25 in certain circumstances. Sections 33 and 37 of this bill indicate that the
40 requirements of sections 32 and 36, respectively, are inapplicable to: (1) coverage
41 provided by a managed care organization to recipients of Medicaid because existing
42 law imposes similar requirements of the Medicaid program; and (2) coverage
43 provided by a managed care organization to members of the Public Employees’
44 Benefits Program. (NRS 422.4053) Section 41 of this bill makes the requirements
45 of section 36 inapplicable to coverage provided by the Public Employees’ Benefits
46 Program to its members. Section 34 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner to
47 suspend or revoke the certificate of a health maintenance organization that fails to
48 comply with the requirements of section 32. The Commissioner would also be
49 authorized to take such action against other third party insurers who fail to comply
50 with the requirements of sections 25, 27-32, 35 and 36. (NRS 680A.200)
51 Section 17 of this bill prohibits a pharmacy benefit manager from: (1)
52 unreasonably obstructing or interfering with the ability of a covered person to
53 timely access a prescription drug at certain pharmacies; (2) agreeing to exclusively
54 cover certain drugs; (3) restricting the ability of a nonaffiliated pharmacy to
55 contract with certain entities; and (4) making or disseminating a false or misleading
56 statement or advertisement. Section 24 of this bill additionally prohibits a
57 pharmacy benefit manager from engaging in certain practices while doing business
58 with pharmacies.
59 Section 19 of this bill requires a pharmacy benefit manager to submit to the
60 Commissioner an annual report detailing certain business practices of the pharmacy
61 benefit manager as well as certain information regarding pricing and rebates
62 relating to the prescription drugs administered by the pharmacy benefit manager.
63 Section 1 of this bill requires third party insurers that provide coverage for
64 prescription drugs to submit a similar report to the Commissioner relating to the
65 pricing of prescription drugs. Section 39 of this bill provides for the confidentiality
66 of the information contained in those reports. Sections 1 and 19 require the
67 Commissioner to compile, submit to the Legislature and publish on the Internet
-
*SB316_R4*
– 3 –
68 biennial reports on the impact of the cost of prescription drugs on health insurance
69 premiums in this State and the overall impact of pharmacy benefit managers on the
70 cost of prescription drugs in this State, based on the reports submitted by third party
71 insurers and pharmacy benefit managers, respectively. Additionally, section 18 of
72 this bill requires the Commissioner to publish on the Internet certain consumer
73 complaints made against pharmacy benefit managers.
74 Existing law exempts certain federally regulated insurance coverage of
75 prescription drugs provided by employers for their employees from requirements
76 governing pharmacy benefit managers except where the pharmacy benefit manager
77 is required by contract to comply with those requirements. (NRS 683A.177)
78 Section 22 of this bill provides that such federally regulated coverage provided by
79 employers for their employees is also exempt from the requirements of this bill
80 governing pharmacy benefit managers, unless required by contract to comply with
81 those requirements. Additionally, sections 21.5 and 22 of this bill exempt coverage
82 of prescription drugs provided by the Public Employees’ Benefits Program,
83 insurance plans for local government employees and Medicaid managed care
84 organizations from the requirements of this bill governing pharmacy benefit
85 managers.
86 Existing law provides that a pharmacy benefit manager has an obligation of
87 good faith and fair dealing toward a third party insurer or pharmacy when
88 performing duties pursuant to a contract to which the pharmacy benefit manager is
89 a party. (NRS 683A.178) Section 23 of this bill provides that a pharmacy benefit
90 manager also has a fiduciary duty to persons covered by a third party insurer for
91 which the pharmacy benefit manager provides pharmacy benefit services. Section
92 23 also: (1) prohibits a pharmacy benefit manager from engaging in an activity that
93 may interfere with the duties and obligations of the pharmacy benefit manager
94 towards third party insurers, pharmacies and covered persons; and (2) authorizes a
95 third party insurer to audit the books and records of a pharmacy benefit manager for
96 certain purposes.
97 Section 18 provides that a pharmacy benefit manager that violates provisions of
98 law governing pharmacy benefit managers, including sections 3-24, is subject to a
99 civil penalty of not less than $1,000 but not more than $7,500 for each violation.
100 Additionally, any violation of sections 3-24 would be a misdemeanor.
101 (NRS 683A.490)
102 If enacted, sections 13-15 of Assembly Bill No. 343 (A.B. 343) of this session
103 will require a hospital to publish certain information about its prices. Section 17 of
104 A.B. 343 prohibits a hospital from taking certain action to collect medical debt
105 while the hospital is not in compliance with those requirements or certain similar
106 federal requirements. (45 C.F.R. §§ 180.40, 180.50, 180.60) Section 41.5 of this
107 bill narrows the applicability of that prohibition to only apply to certain medical
108 debt to which the failure to publish accurate pricing information is directly relevant.
109 Section 41.7 of this bill makes a conforming change to A.B. 343 to reflect the
110 revisions made by section 41.5.

SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

35 information that is not otherwise confidential.
36 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who

SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to insurance.
(BDR 57-777)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to insurance; requiring health insurers, pharmacy
benefit managers and the Commissioner of Insurance to
prepare certain reports; expanding the scope of certain
provisions relating to pharmacy benefit managers;
prohibiting pharmacy benefit managers from engaging in
certain practices; requiring pharmacy benefit managers to
make certain disclosures; imposing requirements relating
to the compensation of pharmacy benefit managers;
revising requirements relating to the collection of certain
medical debt; providing civil and criminal penalties; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires a pharmacy benefit manager, which is an entity that
2 manages a pharmacy benefits plan, to obtain a certificate of registration as an
3 insurance administrator from the Commissioner of Insurance and comply with the
4 requirements that apply to insurance administrators generally. (NRS 683A.025,
5 683A.08522-683A.0893) Existing law additionally imposes certain requirements
6 specifically regulating the operation of pharmacy benefit managers. (NRS
7 683A.171-683A.179) Existing law defines “pharmacy benefits plan” to refer to
8 insurance coverage of prescription drugs. (NRS 683A.175) Section 21 of this bill
9 expands the scope of that definition to also refer to insurance coverage of
10 pharmacist services. Section 21 thereby expands the scope of provisions governing
11 pharmacy benefit managers to also apply to entities that manage such coverage.
12 Sections 3-14 of this bill define certain other terms relevant to pharmacy benefit
-
*SB316_R4*

– 2 –
13 managers, and section 20 of this bill establishes the applicability of those
14 definitions. Section 15 of this bill prohibits a pharmacy benefit manager that
15 manages a pharmacy benefits plan which provides coverage through a network
16 from requiring a person to use a pharmacy affiliated with the pharmacy benefit
17 manager if there are other, nonaffiliated pharmacies in the network. Section 15
18 additionally prohibits a pharmacy benefit manager from engaging in certain
19 practices which are intended to steer or have the effect of steering a person towards
20 an affiliated pharmacy instead of a nonaffiliated pharmacy in the network. Section
21 15 also prohibits a pharmacy benefit manager from discriminating against a
22 nonaffiliated pharmacy.
23 Section 16 of this bill requires a pharmacy benefit manager to disclose to a
24 third party insurer for which the pharmacy benefit manager manages a pharmacy
25 benefits plan: (1) the amounts and types of fees that the pharmacy benefit manager
26 charges the third party insurer for managing the plan or otherwise receives from
27 other entities, including rebates, in connection with managing the plan; and (2)
28 certain information relating to the clinical efficacy and evidence regarding the
29 inclusion or exclusion of certain drugs in a formulary. Section 16 additionally
30 requires a pharmacy benefit manager to make certain contracts available for
31 inspection by the Commissioner.
32 Sections 25, 27-32, 35 and 36 of this bill require certain third party insurers to
33 calculate any cost-sharing obligation for a prescription drug assessed against an
34 insured for the prescription drug: (1) based on the net price that the third party
35 insurer or a pharmacy benefit manager with which the insurer has contracted pays
36 for the drug; and (2) at the point-of-sale. Section 26 of this bill authorizes the
37 Commissioner to require a domestic insurer that issues a policy of individual health
38 insurance to a person residing in another state to meet the requirements of section
39 25 in certain circumstances. Sections 33 and 37 of this bill indicate that the
40 requirements of sections 32 and 36, respectively, are inapplicable to: (1) coverage
41 provided by a managed care organization to recipients of Medicaid because existing
42 law imposes similar requirements of the Medicaid program; and (2) coverage
43 provided by a managed care organization to members of the Public Employees’
44 Benefits Program. (NRS 422.4053) Section 41 of this bill makes the requirements
45 of section 36 inapplicable to coverage provided by the Public Employees’ Benefits
46 Program to its members. Section 34 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner to
47 suspend or revoke the certificate of a health maintenance organization that fails to
48 comply with the requirements of section 32. The Commissioner would also be
49 authorized to take such action against other third party insurers who fail to comply
50 with the requirements of sections 25, 27-32, 35 and 36. (NRS 680A.200)
51 Section 17 of this bill prohibits a pharmacy benefit manager from: (1)
52 unreasonably obstructing or interfering with the ability of a covered person to
53 timely access a prescription drug at certain pharmacies; (2) agreeing to exclusively
54 cover certain drugs; (3) restricting the ability of a nonaffiliated pharmacy to
55 contract with certain entities; and (4) making or disseminating a false or misleading
56 statement or advertisement. Section 24 of this bill additionally prohibits a
57 pharmacy benefit manager from engaging in certain practices while doing business
58 with pharmacies.
59 Section 19 of this bill requires a pharmacy benefit manager to submit to the
60 Commissioner an annual report detailing certain business practices of the pharmacy
61 benefit manager as well as certain information regarding pricing and rebates
62 relating to the prescription drugs administered by the pharmacy benefit manager.
63 Section 1 of this bill requires third party insurers that provide coverage for
64 prescription drugs to submit a similar report to the Commissioner relating to the
65 pricing of prescription drugs. Section 39 of this bill provides for the confidentiality
66 of the information contained in those reports. Sections 1 and 19 require the
67 Commissioner to compile, submit to the Legislature and publish on the Internet
-
*SB316_R4*

– 3 –
68 biennial reports on the impact of the cost of prescription drugs on health insurance
69 premiums in this State and the overall impact of pharmacy benefit managers on the
70 cost of prescription drugs in this State, based on the reports submitted by third party
71 insurers and pharmacy benefit managers, respectively. Additionally, section 18 of
72 this bill requires the Commissioner to publish on the Internet certain consumer
73 complaints made against pharmacy benefit managers.
74 Existing law exempts certain federally regulated insurance coverage of
75 prescription drugs provided by employers for their employees from requirements
76 governing pharmacy benefit managers except where the pharmacy benefit manager
77 is required by contract to comply with those requirements. (NRS 683A.177)
78 Section 22 of this bill provides that such federally regulated coverage provided by
79 employers for their employees is also exempt from the requirements of this bill
80 governing pharmacy benefit managers, unless required by contract to comply with
81 those requirements. Additionally, sections 21.5 and 22 of this bill exempt coverage
82 of prescription drugs provided by the Public Employees’ Benefits Program,
83 insurance plans for local government employees and Medicaid managed care
84 organizations from the requirements of this bill governing pharmacy benefit
85 managers.
86 Existing law provides that a pharmacy benefit manager has an obligation of
87 good faith and fair dealing toward a third party insurer or pharmacy when
88 performing duties pursuant to a contract to which the pharmacy benefit manager is
89 a party. (NRS 683A.178) Section 23 of this bill provides that a pharmacy benefit
90 manager also has a fiduciary duty to persons covered by a third party insurer for
91 which the pharmacy benefit manager provides pharmacy benefit services. Section
92 23 also: (1) prohibits a pharmacy benefit manager from engaging in an activity that
93 may interfere with the duties and obligations of the pharmacy benefit manager
94 towards third party insurers, pharmacies and covered persons; and (2) authorizes a
95 third party insurer to audit the books and records of a pharmacy benefit manager for
96 certain purposes.
97 Section 18 provides that a pharmacy benefit manager that violates provisions of
98 law governing pharmacy benefit managers, including sections 3-24, is subject to a
99 civil penalty of not less than $1,000 but not more than $7,500 for each violation.
100 Additionally, any violation of sections 3-24 would be a misdemeanor.
101 (NRS 683A.490)
102 If enacted, sections 13-15 of Assembly Bill No. 343 (A.B. 343) of this session
103 will require a hospital to publish certain information about its prices. Section 17 of
104 A.B. 343 prohibits a hospital from taking certain action to collect medical debt
105 while the hospital is not in compliance with those requirements or certain similar
106 federal requirements. (45 C.F.R. §§ 180.40, 180.50, 180.60) Section 41.5 of this
107 bill narrows the applicability of that prohibition to only apply to certain medical
108 debt to which the failure to publish accurate pricing information is directly relevant.
109 Section 41.7 of this bill makes a conforming change to A.B. 343 to reflect the
110 revisions made by section 41.5.

28 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
29 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
30 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by
31 means of an electronic medium would:
32 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
33 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential
34 and that cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from
35 information that is not otherwise confidential.
36 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who

43 request, prepare the copy of the public record and shall not require
