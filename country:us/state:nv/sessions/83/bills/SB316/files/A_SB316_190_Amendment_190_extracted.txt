Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires a pharmacy benefit manager, which is an entity that manages a
2 pharmacy benefits plan, to obtain a certificate of registration as an insurance administrator
3 from the Commissioner of Insurance and comply with the requirements that apply to
4 insurance administrators generally. (NRS 683A.025, 683A.08522-683A.0893) Existing law
5 additionally imposes certain requirements specifically regulating the operation of pharmacy
6 benefit managers. (NRS 683A.171-683A.179) Existing law defines “pharmacy benefits plan”
7 to refer to insurance coverage of prescription drugs. (NRS 683A.175) Section 21 of this bill
8 expands the scope of that definition to also refer to insurance coverage of pharmacist services.
9 Section 21 thereby expands the scope of provisions governing pharmacy benefit managers to
10 also apply to entities that manage such coverage. Sections 3-14 of this bill define certain other
Senate Amendment No. 190 to Senate Bill No. 316 Page 4
11 terms relevant to pharmacy benefit managers, and section 20 of this bill establishes the
12 applicability of those definitions. Section 15 of this bill prohibits a pharmacy benefit manager
13 that manages a pharmacy benefits plan which provides coverage through a network from
14 requiring a person to use a pharmacy affiliated with the pharmacy benefit manager if there are
15 other, nonaffiliated pharmacies in the network. Section 15 additionally prohibits a pharmacy
16 benefit manager from engaging in certain practices which are intended or have the effect of
17 steering a person towards an affiliated pharmacy instead of a nonaffiliated pharmacy in the
18 network. Section 15 also prohibits a pharmacy benefit manager from discriminating against a
19 nonaffiliated pharmacy.
20 Section 16 of this bill requires a pharmacy benefit manager to disclose to a third party
21 insurer for which the pharmacy benefit manager manages a pharmacy benefits plan: (1) the
22 amounts and types of fees that the pharmacy benefit manager charges the third party insurer
23 for managing the plan or otherwise receives from other entities, including rebates, in
24 connection with managing the plan; and (2) certain information relating to the clinical efficacy
25 and evidence regarding the inclusion or exclusion of certain drugs in a formulary. Section 16
26 additionally requires a pharmacy benefit manager to make certain contracts available for
27 inspection by the Commissioner.
28 Existing law establishes the basis upon which insurance administrators, which
29 include pharmacy benefit managers, may be compensated for their services. (NRS
30 683A.0883) Section 16.5 of this bill prohibits, as of January 1, 2028, a pharmacy benefit
31 manager from deriving any income from the provision of pharmacy benefit management
32 services other than income derived from administrative fees paid to the pharmacy
33 benefit manager by a third party insurer for the provision of such services pursuant to
34 an agreement that provides for such fees.
35 Existing law authorizes the Department of Health and Human Services to enter into a
36 contract with a pharmacy benefit manager to manage coverage of prescription drugs under the
37 State Plan for Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program that requires the
38 pharmacy benefit manager to provide to the Department all rebates received for purchasing
39 drugs in relation to those programs. (NRS 422.4053) Section [16] 16.5 imposes similar
40 requirements for pharmacy benefit managers that manage other pharmacy benefits plans.
41 Specifically, section [16] 16.5 requires a pharmacy benefit manager to provide [the entire
42 amount of any rebate the pharmacy benefit manager receives] : (1) income generated
43 through discounts, fees and other incentives received from a manufacturer or wholesaler
44 in connection with providing pharmacy benefit management services for a third party insurer
45 that provides pharmacy coverage to the third party insurer [.] ; and (2) income generated
46 through rebates received from a manufacturer or wholesaler in connection with
47 providing pharmacy benefit management services for a third party insurer to persons
48 covered by the third party insurer. Sections 25, 27-32, 35, 36, 40 and 41 of this bill require
49 certain third party insurers that provide coverage for prescription drugs to [use any rebate
50 money received from a pharmacy benefit manager pursuant to section 16 for the sole purpose
51 of reducing premiums and eliminating or reducing cost-sharing obligations of covered
52 persons.] include, when calculating the cost-sharing obligation or maximum out-of-
53 pocket expense of an insured under certain circumstances, all amounts paid by the
54 insured or another person on behalf of an insured towards the cost of a covered
55 prescription drug. Sections 25, 27-32, 35, 36 [,] and 40 [and 41] also prohibit third party
56 insurers from imposing on an insured a cost-sharing obligation for a prescription drug which
57 is greater than the net amount that the third party insurer pays for the drug. Section 26 of this
58 bill authorizes the Commissioner to require a domestic insurer that issues a policy of
59 individual health insurance to a person residing in another state to meet the requirements of
60 section 25 in certain circumstances. Sections 33 and 37 of this bill indicate that the
61 requirements of sections 32 and 36, respectively, are inapplicable to [a managed care
62 organization that is providing] : (1) coverage provided by a managed care organization to
63 recipients of Medicaid because existing law imposes similar requirements of the Medicaid
64 program [.] ; and (2) coverage provided by a managed care organization to members of
65 the Public Employees’ Benefits Program. (NRS 422.4053) Section 41 of this bill makes
66 the requirements of section 36 inapplicable to coverage provided by the Public
67 Employees’ Benefits Program to its members. Section 34 of this bill authorizes the
68 Commissioner to suspend or revoke the certificate of a health maintenance organization that
69 fails to comply with the requirements of section 32. The Commissioner would also be
Senate Amendment No. 190 to Senate Bill No. 316 Page 5
70 authorized to take such action against other third party insurers who fail to comply with the
71 requirements of sections 25, 27-32, 35 and 36. (NRS 680A.200)
72 Section 17 of this bill prohibits a pharmacy benefit manager from: (1) unreasonably
73 obstructing or interfering with the ability of a covered person to timely access a prescription
74 drug at certain pharmacies; (2) agreeing to exclusively cover certain drugs; (3) restricting the
75 ability of a nonaffiliated pharmacy to contract with certain entities; and (4) making or
76 disseminating a false or misleading statement or advertisement. Section 24 of this bill
77 additionally prohibits a pharmacy benefit manager from engaging in certain practices while
78 doing business with pharmacies.
79 Section 19 of this bill requires a pharmacy benefit manager to submit to the
80 Commissioner an annual report detailing certain business practices of the pharmacy benefit
81 manager as well as certain information regarding pricing and rebates relating to the
82 prescription drugs administered by the pharmacy benefit manager. Section 1 of this bill
83 requires third party insurers to submit a similar report to the Commissioner relating to the
84 pricing of prescription drugs. Section 39 of this bill provides for the confidentiality of the
85 information contained in those reports. Sections 1 and 19 require the Commissioner to
86 compile, submit to the Legislature and publish on the Internet biennial reports on the impact
87 of the cost of prescription drugs on health insurance premiums in this State and the overall
88 impact of pharmacy benefit managers on the cost of prescription drugs in this State, based on
89 the reports submitted by third party insurers and pharmacy benefit managers, respectively.
90 Additionally, section 18 of this bill requires the Commissioner to publish on the Internet
91 certain consumer complaints made against pharmacy benefit managers.
92 Existing law exempts certain federally regulated insurance coverage of prescription drugs
93 provided by employers for their employees from requirements governing pharmacy benefit
94 managers except where the pharmacy benefit manager is required by contract to comply with
95 those requirements. (NRS 683A.177) Section 22 of this bill provides that such federally
96 regulated coverage provided by employers for their employees is also exempt from the
97 requirements of this bill governing pharmacy benefit managers, unless required by contract to
98 comply with those requirements. Additionally, sections 21.5 and 22 of this bill exempt
99 coverage of prescription drugs provided by the Public Employees’ Benefits Program and
100 Medicaid managed care organizations from the requirements of this bill governing
101 pharmacy benefit managers.
102 Existing law provides that a pharmacy benefit manager has an obligation of good faith
103 and fair dealing toward a third party insurer or pharmacy when performing duties pursuant to
104 a contract to which the pharmacy benefit manager is a party. (NRS 683A.178) Section 23 of
105 this bill provides that a pharmacy benefit manager also has [an obligation to act with care,
106 skill, prudence, diligence and professionalism towards] a fiduciary duty to persons covered
107 by a third party insurer [when providing] for which the pharmacy benefit manager
108 provides pharmacy benefit services . [pursuant to a contract with the third party insurer.]
109 Section 23 also: (1) prohibits a pharmacy benefit manager from engaging in an activity
110 that may interfere with the duties and obligations of the pharmacy benefit manager
111 towards third party insurers, pharmacies and covered persons; and (2) authorizes a
112 third party insurer to audit the books and records of a pharmacy benefit manager for
113 certain purposes.
114 Section 18 provides that a pharmacy benefit manager that violates provisions of law
115 governing pharmacy benefit managers, including sections 3-24, is subject to a civil penalty of
116 not less than $1,000 but not more than $7,500 for each violation.
117 Existing law defines various activities involving businesses and occupations that
118 constitute deceptive trade practices. (NRS 598.0915-589.0925) If a person engages in a
119 deceptive trade practice, the person may be subject to a civil action brought by certain persons
120 and certain civil and criminal penalties. (NRS 598.0999) Section 18 makes certain violations
121 of sections 15 and 24 a deceptive trade practice, thereby subjecting a violation of those
122 provisions to additional penalties. However, sections 18, 38 and 42 of this bill provide that
123 such violations do not give rise to a private right of action.

16 710.159, 711.600, and sections 1 and 19 of this act, sections 35, 38 and 41 of
17 chapter 478, Statutes of Nevada 2011 and section 2 of chapter 391, Statutes of
18 Nevada 2013 and unless otherwise declared by law to be confidential, all public
19 books and public records of a governmental entity must be open at all times during
20 office hours to inspection by any person, and may be fully copied or an abstract or
21 memorandum may be prepared from those public books and public records. Any
22 such copies, abstracts or memoranda may be used to supply the general public with
23 copies, abstracts or memoranda of the records or may be used in any other way to
24 the advantage of the governmental entity or of the general public. This section does
25 not supersede or in any manner affect the federal laws governing copyrights or
26 enlarge, diminish or affect in any other manner the rights of a person in any written
27 book or record which is copyrighted pursuant to federal law.
28 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record which is
29 copyrighted solely because it is copyrighted.
30 3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a public book or
31 record shall not deny a request made pursuant to subsection 1 to inspect or copy or
32 receive a copy of a public book or record on the basis that the requested public
33 book or record contains information that is confidential if the governmental entity
34 can redact, delete, conceal or separate, including, without limitation, electronically,
35 the confidential information from the information included in the public book or
36 record that is not otherwise confidential.
37 4. If requested, a governmental entity shall provide a copy of a public record
38 in an electronic format by means of an electronic medium. Nothing in this
39 subsection requires a governmental entity to provide a copy of a public record in an
40 electronic format or by means of an electronic medium if:
41 (a) The public record:
42 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
43 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
44 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by means of an
45 electronic medium would:
46 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
47 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential and that
48 cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from information that is not
49 otherwise confidential.
50 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who has legal
51 custody or control of a public record:
Senate Amendment No. 190 to Senate Bill No. 316 Page 27
1 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the medium that
2 is requested because the officer, employee or agent has already prepared or would
3 prefer to provide the copy in a different medium.
4 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon request, prepare
5 the copy of the public record and shall not require the person who has requested the
6 copy to prepare the copy himself or herself.
7 Sec. 40. NRS 287.010 is hereby amended to read as follows:
8 287.010 1. The governing body of any county, school district, municipal
9 corporation, political subdivision, public corporation or other local governmental
10 agency of the State of Nevada may:
11 (a) Adopt and carry into effect a system of group life, accident or health
12 insurance, or any combination thereof, for the benefit of its officers and employees,
13 and the dependents of officers and employees who elect to accept the insurance and
14 who, where necessary, have authorized the governing body to make deductions
15 from their compensation for the payment of premiums on the insurance.
16 (b) Purchase group policies of life, accident or health insurance, or any
17 combination thereof, for the benefit of such officers and employees, and the
18 dependents of such officers and employees, as have authorized the purchase, from
19 insurance companies authorized to transact the business of such insurance in the
20 State of Nevada, and, where necessary, deduct from the compensation of officers
21 and employees the premiums upon insurance and pay the deductions upon the
22 premiums.
23 (c) Provide group life, accident or health coverage through a self-insurance
24 reserve fund and, where necessary, deduct contributions to the maintenance of the
25 fund from the compensation of officers and employees and pay the deductions into
26 the fund. The money accumulated for this purpose through deductions from the
27 compensation of officers and employees and contributions of the governing body
28 must be maintained as an internal service fund as defined by NRS 354.543. The
29 money must be deposited in a state or national bank or credit union authorized to
30 transact business in the State of Nevada. Any independent administrator of a fund
31 created under this section is subject to the licensing requirements of chapter 683A
32 of NRS, and must be a resident of this State. Any contract with an independent
33 administrator must be approved by the Commissioner of Insurance as to the
34 reasonableness of administrative charges in relation to contributions collected and

40 and section 27 of this act apply to coverage provided pursuant to this paragraph,
41 except that the provisions of NRS 689B.0378, 689B.03785 and 689B.500 only
42 apply to coverage for active officers and employees of the governing body, or the
43 dependents of such officers and employees.
44 (d) Defray part or all of the cost of maintenance of a self-insurance fund or of
45 the premiums upon insurance. The money for contributions must be budgeted for in
46 accordance with the laws governing the county, school district, municipal
47 corporation, political subdivision, public corporation or other local governmental
48 agency of the State of Nevada.
49 2. If a school district offers group insurance to its officers and employees
50 pursuant to this section, members of the board of trustees of the school district must
51 not be excluded from participating in the group insurance. If the amount of the
52 deductions from compensation required to pay for the group insurance exceeds the
Senate Amendment No. 190 to Senate Bill No. 316 Page 28
1 compensation to which a trustee is entitled, the difference must be paid by the
2 trustee.
3 3. In any county in which a legal services organization exists, the governing
4 body of the county, or of any school district, municipal corporation, political
5 subdivision, public corporation or other local governmental agency of the State of
6 Nevada in the county, may enter into a contract with the legal services organization
7 pursuant to which the officers and employees of the legal services organization, and
8 the dependents of those officers and employees, are eligible for any life, accident or
9 health insurance provided pursuant to this section to the officers and employees,
10 and the dependents of the officers and employees, of the county, school district,
11 municipal corporation, political subdivision, public corporation or other local
12 governmental agency.
13 4. If a contract is entered into pursuant to subsection 3, the officers and
14 employees of the legal services organization:
15 (a) Shall be deemed, solely for the purposes of this section, to be officers and
16 employees of the county, school district, municipal corporation, political
17 subdivision, public corporation or other local governmental agency with which the
18 legal services organization has contracted; and
19 (b) Must be required by the contract to pay the premiums or contributions for
20 all insurance which they elect to accept or of which they authorize the purchase.
21 5. A contract that is entered into pursuant to subsection 3:
22 (a) Must be submitted to the Commissioner of Insurance for approval not less
23 than 30 days before the date on which the contract is to become effective.

28 that operates a program for legal aid and receives money pursuant to NRS 19.031.
29 Sec. 41. NRS 287.04335 is hereby amended to read as follows:
30 287.04335 If the Board provides health insurance through a plan of self-
31 insurance, it shall comply with the provisions of NRS 439.581 to 439.597,

38 act,] in the same manner as an insurer that is licensed pursuant to title 57 of NRS is
39 required to comply with those provisions.
40 Sec. 42. NRS 598.0977 is hereby amended to read as follows:
41 598.0977 Except as otherwise provided in NRS 603A.550 [,] and section 18

45 engaged in the practice to recover the actual damages suffered by the elderly person
46 or person with a disability, punitive damages, if appropriate, and reasonable
47 attorney’s fees. The collection of any restitution awarded pursuant to this section

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to insurance; requiring health insurers, pharmacy benefit
managers and the Commissioner of Insurance to prepare certain
reports; expanding the scope of certain provisions relating to pharmacy
benefit managers; prohibiting pharmacy benefit managers from
engaging in certain practices; requiring pharmacy benefit managers to
make certain disclosures; [requiring pharmacy benefit managers to
pass rebates along to certain insurers and insureds; requiring certain
insurers to use passed-along rebate funds for certain purposes;]
imposing requirements relating to the compensation of pharmacy
benefit managers; requiring pharmacy benefit managers to pass
certain discounts, incentives, rebates and other fees along to third
parties and covered persons; prohibiting insurers from assessing
certain cost-sharing obligations in certain circumstances; requiring
insurers to credit certain amounts paid by or on behalf of an
insured for a prescription drug towards certain obligations of an
insured in certain circumstances; providing civil and criminal
penalties; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires a pharmacy benefit manager, which is an entity that manages a
2 pharmacy benefits plan, to obtain a certificate of registration as an insurance administrator
3 from the Commissioner of Insurance and comply with the requirements that apply to
4 insurance administrators generally. (NRS 683A.025, 683A.08522-683A.0893) Existing law
5 additionally imposes certain requirements specifically regulating the operation of pharmacy
6 benefit managers. (NRS 683A.171-683A.179) Existing law defines “pharmacy benefits plan”
7 to refer to insurance coverage of prescription drugs. (NRS 683A.175) Section 21 of this bill
8 expands the scope of that definition to also refer to insurance coverage of pharmacist services.
9 Section 21 thereby expands the scope of provisions governing pharmacy benefit managers to
10 also apply to entities that manage such coverage. Sections 3-14 of this bill define certain other

Senate Amendment No. 190 to Senate Bill No. 316 Page 4
11 terms relevant to pharmacy benefit managers, and section 20 of this bill establishes the
12 applicability of those definitions. Section 15 of this bill prohibits a pharmacy benefit manager
13 that manages a pharmacy benefits plan which provides coverage through a network from
14 requiring a person to use a pharmacy affiliated with the pharmacy benefit manager if there are
15 other, nonaffiliated pharmacies in the network. Section 15 additionally prohibits a pharmacy
16 benefit manager from engaging in certain practices which are intended or have the effect of
17 steering a person towards an affiliated pharmacy instead of a nonaffiliated pharmacy in the
18 network. Section 15 also prohibits a pharmacy benefit manager from discriminating against a
19 nonaffiliated pharmacy.
20 Section 16 of this bill requires a pharmacy benefit manager to disclose to a third party
21 insurer for which the pharmacy benefit manager manages a pharmacy benefits plan: (1) the
22 amounts and types of fees that the pharmacy benefit manager charges the third party insurer
23 for managing the plan or otherwise receives from other entities, including rebates, in
24 connection with managing the plan; and (2) certain information relating to the clinical efficacy
25 and evidence regarding the inclusion or exclusion of certain drugs in a formulary. Section 16
26 additionally requires a pharmacy benefit manager to make certain contracts available for
27 inspection by the Commissioner.
28 Existing law establishes the basis upon which insurance administrators, which
29 include pharmacy benefit managers, may be compensated for their services. (NRS
30 683A.0883) Section 16.5 of this bill prohibits, as of January 1, 2028, a pharmacy benefit
31 manager from deriving any income from the provision of pharmacy benefit management
32 services other than income derived from administrative fees paid to the pharmacy
33 benefit manager by a third party insurer for the provision of such services pursuant to
34 an agreement that provides for such fees.
35 Existing law authorizes the Department of Health and Human Services to enter into a
36 contract with a pharmacy benefit manager to manage coverage of prescription drugs under the
37 State Plan for Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program that requires the
38 pharmacy benefit manager to provide to the Department all rebates received for purchasing
39 drugs in relation to those programs. (NRS 422.4053) Section [16] 16.5 imposes similar
40 requirements for pharmacy benefit managers that manage other pharmacy benefits plans.
41 Specifically, section [16] 16.5 requires a pharmacy benefit manager to provide [the entire
42 amount of any rebate the pharmacy benefit manager receives] : (1) income generated
43 through discounts, fees and other incentives received from a manufacturer or wholesaler
44 in connection with providing pharmacy benefit management services for a third party insurer
45 that provides pharmacy coverage to the third party insurer [.] ; and (2) income generated
46 through rebates received from a manufacturer or wholesaler in connection with
47 providing pharmacy benefit management services for a third party insurer to persons
48 covered by the third party insurer. Sections 25, 27-32, 35, 36, 40 and 41 of this bill require
49 certain third party insurers that provide coverage for prescription drugs to [use any rebate
50 money received from a pharmacy benefit manager pursuant to section 16 for the sole purpose
51 of reducing premiums and eliminating or reducing cost-sharing obligations of covered
52 persons.] include, when calculating the cost-sharing obligation or maximum out-of-
53 pocket expense of an insured under certain circumstances, all amounts paid by the
54 insured or another person on behalf of an insured towards the cost of a covered
55 prescription drug. Sections 25, 27-32, 35, 36 [,] and 40 [and 41] also prohibit third party
56 insurers from imposing on an insured a cost-sharing obligation for a prescription drug which
57 is greater than the net amount that the third party insurer pays for the drug. Section 26 of this
58 bill authorizes the Commissioner to require a domestic insurer that issues a policy of
59 individual health insurance to a person residing in another state to meet the requirements of
60 section 25 in certain circumstances. Sections 33 and 37 of this bill indicate that the
61 requirements of sections 32 and 36, respectively, are inapplicable to [a managed care
62 organization that is providing] : (1) coverage provided by a managed care organization to
63 recipients of Medicaid because existing law imposes similar requirements of the Medicaid
64 program [.] ; and (2) coverage provided by a managed care organization to members of
65 the Public Employees’ Benefits Program. (NRS 422.4053) Section 41 of this bill makes
66 the requirements of section 36 inapplicable to coverage provided by the Public
67 Employees’ Benefits Program to its members. Section 34 of this bill authorizes the
68 Commissioner to suspend or revoke the certificate of a health maintenance organization that
69 fails to comply with the requirements of section 32. The Commissioner would also be

Senate Amendment No. 190 to Senate Bill No. 316 Page 5
70 authorized to take such action against other third party insurers who fail to comply with the
71 requirements of sections 25, 27-32, 35 and 36. (NRS 680A.200)
72 Section 17 of this bill prohibits a pharmacy benefit manager from: (1) unreasonably
73 obstructing or interfering with the ability of a covered person to timely access a prescription
74 drug at certain pharmacies; (2) agreeing to exclusively cover certain drugs; (3) restricting the
75 ability of a nonaffiliated pharmacy to contract with certain entities; and (4) making or
76 disseminating a false or misleading statement or advertisement. Section 24 of this bill
77 additionally prohibits a pharmacy benefit manager from engaging in certain practices while
78 doing business with pharmacies.
79 Section 19 of this bill requires a pharmacy benefit manager to submit to the
80 Commissioner an annual report detailing certain business practices of the pharmacy benefit
81 manager as well as certain information regarding pricing and rebates relating to the
82 prescription drugs administered by the pharmacy benefit manager. Section 1 of this bill
83 requires third party insurers to submit a similar report to the Commissioner relating to the
84 pricing of prescription drugs. Section 39 of this bill provides for the confidentiality of the
85 information contained in those reports. Sections 1 and 19 require the Commissioner to
86 compile, submit to the Legislature and publish on the Internet biennial reports on the impact
87 of the cost of prescription drugs on health insurance premiums in this State and the overall
88 impact of pharmacy benefit managers on the cost of prescription drugs in this State, based on
89 the reports submitted by third party insurers and pharmacy benefit managers, respectively.
90 Additionally, section 18 of this bill requires the Commissioner to publish on the Internet
91 certain consumer complaints made against pharmacy benefit managers.
92 Existing law exempts certain federally regulated insurance coverage of prescription drugs
93 provided by employers for their employees from requirements governing pharmacy benefit
94 managers except where the pharmacy benefit manager is required by contract to comply with
95 those requirements. (NRS 683A.177) Section 22 of this bill provides that such federally
96 regulated coverage provided by employers for their employees is also exempt from the
97 requirements of this bill governing pharmacy benefit managers, unless required by contract to
98 comply with those requirements. Additionally, sections 21.5 and 22 of this bill exempt
99 coverage of prescription drugs provided by the Public Employees’ Benefits Program and
100 Medicaid managed care organizations from the requirements of this bill governing
101 pharmacy benefit managers.
102 Existing law provides that a pharmacy benefit manager has an obligation of good faith
103 and fair dealing toward a third party insurer or pharmacy when performing duties pursuant to
104 a contract to which the pharmacy benefit manager is a party. (NRS 683A.178) Section 23 of
105 this bill provides that a pharmacy benefit manager also has [an obligation to act with care,
106 skill, prudence, diligence and professionalism towards] a fiduciary duty to persons covered
107 by a third party insurer [when providing] for which the pharmacy benefit manager
108 provides pharmacy benefit services . [pursuant to a contract with the third party insurer.]
109 Section 23 also: (1) prohibits a pharmacy benefit manager from engaging in an activity
110 that may interfere with the duties and obligations of the pharmacy benefit manager
111 towards third party insurers, pharmacies and covered persons; and (2) authorizes a
112 third party insurer to audit the books and records of a pharmacy benefit manager for
113 certain purposes.
114 Section 18 provides that a pharmacy benefit manager that violates provisions of law
115 governing pharmacy benefit managers, including sections 3-24, is subject to a civil penalty of
116 not less than $1,000 but not more than $7,500 for each violation.
117 Existing law defines various activities involving businesses and occupations that
118 constitute deceptive trade practices. (NRS 598.0915-589.0925) If a person engages in a
119 deceptive trade practice, the person may be subject to a civil action brought by certain persons
120 and certain civil and criminal penalties. (NRS 598.0999) Section 18 makes certain violations
121 of sections 15 and 24 a deceptive trade practice, thereby subjecting a violation of those
122 provisions to additional penalties. However, sections 18, 38 and 42 of this bill provide that
123 such violations do not give rise to a private right of action.

16 710.159, 711.600, and sections 1 and 19 of this act, sections 35, 38 and 41 of
17 chapter 478, Statutes of Nevada 2011 and section 2 of chapter 391, Statutes of
18 Nevada 2013 and unless otherwise declared by law to be confidential, all public
19 books and public records of a governmental entity must be open at all times during
20 office hours to inspection by any person, and may be fully copied or an abstract or
21 memorandum may be prepared from those public books and public records. Any
22 such copies, abstracts or memoranda may be used to supply the general public with
23 copies, abstracts or memoranda of the records or may be used in any other way to
24 the advantage of the governmental entity or of the general public. This section does
25 not supersede or in any manner affect the federal laws governing copyrights or
26 enlarge, diminish or affect in any other manner the rights of a person in any written
27 book or record which is copyrighted pursuant to federal law.
28 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record which is
29 copyrighted solely because it is copyrighted.
30 3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a public book or
31 record shall not deny a request made pursuant to subsection 1 to inspect or copy or
32 receive a copy of a public book or record on the basis that the requested public
33 book or record contains information that is confidential if the governmental entity
34 can redact, delete, conceal or separate, including, without limitation, electronically,
35 the confidential information from the information included in the public book or
36 record that is not otherwise confidential.
37 4. If requested, a governmental entity shall provide a copy of a public record
38 in an electronic format by means of an electronic medium. Nothing in this
39 subsection requires a governmental entity to provide a copy of a public record in an
40 electronic format or by means of an electronic medium if:
41 (a) The public record:
42 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
43 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
44 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by means of an
45 electronic medium would:
46 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
47 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential and that
48 cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from information that is not
49 otherwise confidential.
50 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who has legal
51 custody or control of a public record:

Senate Amendment No. 190 to Senate Bill No. 316 Page 27
1 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the medium that
2 is requested because the officer, employee or agent has already prepared or would
3 prefer to provide the copy in a different medium.
4 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon request, prepare
5 the copy of the public record and shall not require the person who has requested the
6 copy to prepare the copy himself or herself.
7 Sec. 40. NRS 287.010 is hereby amended to read as follows:
8 287.010 1. The governing body of any county, school district, municipal
9 corporation, political subdivision, public corporation or other local governmental
10 agency of the State of Nevada may:
11 (a) Adopt and carry into effect a system of group life, accident or health
12 insurance, or any combination thereof, for the benefit of its officers and employees,
13 and the dependents of officers and employees who elect to accept the insurance and
14 who, where necessary, have authorized the governing body to make deductions
15 from their compensation for the payment of premiums on the insurance.
16 (b) Purchase group policies of life, accident or health insurance, or any
17 combination thereof, for the benefit of such officers and employees, and the
18 dependents of such officers and employees, as have authorized the purchase, from
19 insurance companies authorized to transact the business of such insurance in the
20 State of Nevada, and, where necessary, deduct from the compensation of officers
21 and employees the premiums upon insurance and pay the deductions upon the
22 premiums.
23 (c) Provide group life, accident or health coverage through a self-insurance
24 reserve fund and, where necessary, deduct contributions to the maintenance of the
25 fund from the compensation of officers and employees and pay the deductions into
26 the fund. The money accumulated for this purpose through deductions from the
27 compensation of officers and employees and contributions of the governing body
28 must be maintained as an internal service fund as defined by NRS 354.543. The
29 money must be deposited in a state or national bank or credit union authorized to
30 transact business in the State of Nevada. Any independent administrator of a fund
31 created under this section is subject to the licensing requirements of chapter 683A
32 of NRS, and must be a resident of this State. Any contract with an independent
33 administrator must be approved by the Commissioner of Insurance as to the
34 reasonableness of administrative charges in relation to contributions collected and
35 benefits provided. The provisions of NRS 439.581 to 439.597, inclusive, 686A.135,
36 687B.352, 687B.408, 687B.692, 687B.723, 687B.725, 687B.805, 689B.030 to

38 subsections 2, 4, 6 and 7 of NRS 689B.0319, 689B.033 to 689B.0369, inclusive,
39 689B.0375 to 689B.050, inclusive, 689B.0675, 689B.265, 689B.287 and 689B.500
40 and section 27 of this act apply to coverage provided pursuant to this paragraph,
41 except that the provisions of NRS 689B.0378, 689B.03785 and 689B.500 only
42 apply to coverage for active officers and employees of the governing body, or the
43 dependents of such officers and employees.
44 (d) Defray part or all of the cost of maintenance of a self-insurance fund or of
45 the premiums upon insurance. The money for contributions must be budgeted for in
46 accordance with the laws governing the county, school district, municipal
47 corporation, political subdivision, public corporation or other local governmental
48 agency of the State of Nevada.
49 2. If a school district offers group insurance to its officers and employees
50 pursuant to this section, members of the board of trustees of the school district must
51 not be excluded from participating in the group insurance. If the amount of the
52 deductions from compensation required to pay for the group insurance exceeds the

Senate Amendment No. 190 to Senate Bill No. 316 Page 28
1 compensation to which a trustee is entitled, the difference must be paid by the
2 trustee.
3 3. In any county in which a legal services organization exists, the governing
4 body of the county, or of any school district, municipal corporation, political
5 subdivision, public corporation or other local governmental agency of the State of
6 Nevada in the county, may enter into a contract with the legal services organization
7 pursuant to which the officers and employees of the legal services organization, and
8 the dependents of those officers and employees, are eligible for any life, accident or
9 health insurance provided pursuant to this section to the officers and employees,
10 and the dependents of the officers and employees, of the county, school district,
11 municipal corporation, political subdivision, public corporation or other local
12 governmental agency.
13 4. If a contract is entered into pursuant to subsection 3, the officers and
14 employees of the legal services organization:
15 (a) Shall be deemed, solely for the purposes of this section, to be officers and
16 employees of the county, school district, municipal corporation, political
17 subdivision, public corporation or other local governmental agency with which the
18 legal services organization has contracted; and
19 (b) Must be required by the contract to pay the premiums or contributions for
20 all insurance which they elect to accept or of which they authorize the purchase.
21 5. A contract that is entered into pursuant to subsection 3:
22 (a) Must be submitted to the Commissioner of Insurance for approval not less
23 than 30 days before the date on which the contract is to become effective.
24 (b) Does not become effective unless approved by the Commissioner.
25 (c) Shall be deemed to be approved if not disapproved by the Commissioner
26 within 30 days after its submission.
27 6. As used in this section, “legal services organization” means an organization
28 that operates a program for legal aid and receives money pursuant to NRS 19.031.
29 Sec. 41. NRS 287.04335 is hereby amended to read as follows:
30 287.04335 If the Board provides health insurance through a plan of self-
31 insurance, it shall comply with the provisions of NRS 439.581 to 439.597,
32 inclusive, 686A.135, 687B.352, 687B.409, 687B.692, 687B.723, 687B.725,
33 687B.805, 689B.0353, 689B.255, 695C.1723, 695G.150, 695G.155, 695G.160,

37 695G.241 to 695G.310, inclusive, 695G.405 and 695G.415, [and section 36 of this
38 act,] in the same manner as an insurer that is licensed pursuant to title 57 of NRS is
39 required to comply with those provisions.
40 Sec. 42. NRS 598.0977 is hereby amended to read as follows:
41 598.0977 Except as otherwise provided in NRS 603A.550 [,] and section 18
42 of this act, if an elderly person or a person with a disability suffers damage or
43 injury as a result of a deceptive trade practice, he or she or his or her legal
44 representative, if any, may commence a civil action against any person who
45 engaged in the practice to recover the actual damages suffered by the elderly person
46 or person with a disability, punitive damages, if appropriate, and reasonable
47 attorney’s fees. The collection of any restitution awarded pursuant to this section
48 has a priority over the collection of any civil penalty imposed pursuant to NRS
49 598.0973.
50 Sec. 43. The amendatory provisions of this act do not apply to any contract
51 or other agreement entered into before January 1, 2026, but apply to the renewal of
52 any such contract or other agreement.

Senate Amendment No. 190 to Senate Bill No. 316 Page 29
