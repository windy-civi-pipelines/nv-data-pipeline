reports; expanding the scope of certain provisions relating to pharmacy

thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires a pharmacy benefit manager, which is an entity that manages a
2 pharmacy benefits plan, to obtain a certificate of registration as an insurance administrator
3 from the Commissioner of Insurance and comply with the requirements that apply to
4 insurance administrators generally. (NRS 683A.025, 683A.08522-683A.0893) Existing law
5 additionally imposes certain requirements specifically regulating the operation of pharmacy
6 benefit managers. (NRS 683A.171-683A.179) Existing law defines “pharmacy benefits plan”
7 to refer to insurance coverage of prescription drugs. (NRS 683A.175) Section 21 of this bill
8 expands the scope of that definition to also refer to insurance coverage of pharmacist services.
9 Section 21 thereby expands the scope of provisions governing pharmacy benefit managers to
10 also apply to entities that manage such coverage. Sections 3-14 of this bill define certain other
11 terms relevant to pharmacy benefit managers, and section 20 of this bill establishes the
12 applicability of those definitions. Section 15 of this bill prohibits a pharmacy benefit manager
13 that manages a pharmacy benefits plan which provides coverage through a network from

Senate Amendment No. 848 to Senate Bill No. 316 First Reprint Page 4
14 requiring a person to use a pharmacy affiliated with the pharmacy benefit manager if there are
15 other, nonaffiliated pharmacies in the network. Section 15 additionally prohibits a pharmacy
16 benefit manager from engaging in certain practices which are intended to steer or have the
17 effect of steering a person towards an affiliated pharmacy instead of a nonaffiliated pharmacy
18 in the network. Section 15 also prohibits a pharmacy benefit manager from discriminating
19 against a nonaffiliated pharmacy.
20 Section 16 of this bill requires a pharmacy benefit manager to disclose to a third party
21 insurer for which the pharmacy benefit manager manages a pharmacy benefits plan: (1) the
22 amounts and types of fees that the pharmacy benefit manager charges the third party insurer
23 for managing the plan or otherwise receives from other entities, including rebates, in
24 connection with managing the plan; and (2) certain information relating to the clinical efficacy
25 and evidence regarding the inclusion or exclusion of certain drugs in a formulary. Section 16
26 additionally requires a pharmacy benefit manager to make certain contracts available for
27 inspection by the Commissioner.
28 [Existing law establishes the basis upon which insurance administrators, which include
29 pharmacy benefit managers, may be compensated for their services. (NRS 683A.0883)
30 Section 16.5 of this bill prohibits, as of January 1, 2028, a pharmacy benefit manager from
31 deriving any income from the provision of pharmacy benefit management services other than
32 income derived from administrative fees paid to the pharmacy benefit manager by a third
33 party insurer for the provision of such services pursuant to an agreement that provides for
34 such fees.
35 Existing law authorizes the Department of Health and Human Services to enter into a
36 contract with a pharmacy benefit manager to manage coverage of prescription drugs under the
37 State Plan for Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program that requires the
38 pharmacy benefit manager to provide to the Department all rebates received for purchasing
39 drugs in relation to those programs. (NRS 422.4053) Section 16.5 imposes similar
40 requirements for pharmacy benefit managers that manage other pharmacy benefits plans.
41 Specifically, section 16.5 requires a pharmacy benefit manager to provide: (1) income
42 generated through discounts, fees and other incentives received from a manufacturer or
43 wholesaler in connection with providing pharmacy benefit management services for a third
44 party insurer that provides pharmacy coverage to the third party insurer; and (2) income
45 generated through rebates received from a manufacturer or wholesaler in connection with
46 providing pharmacy benefit management services for a third party insurer to persons covered
47 by the third party insurer. Sections 25, 27-32, 35, 36, 40 and 41 of this bill require certain
48 third party insurers that provide coverage for prescription drugs to include, when calculating
49 the cost-sharing obligation or maximum out-of-pocket expense of an insured under certain
50 circumstances, all amounts paid by the insured or another person on behalf of an insured
51 towards the cost of a covered prescription drug.] Sections 25, 27-32, 35 [,] and 36 [and 40
52 also] of this bill prohibit certain third party insurers from imposing on an insured a cost-
53 sharing obligation for a prescription drug which is greater than the net [amount] price that the
54 third party insurer or a pharmacy benefit manager with which the insurer has contracted
55 pays for the drug. Section 26 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner to require a domestic
56 insurer that issues a policy of individual health insurance to a person residing in another state
57 to meet the requirements of section 25 in certain circumstances. Sections 33 and 37 of this
58 bill indicate that the requirements of sections 32 and 36, respectively, are inapplicable to: (1)
59 coverage provided by a managed care organization to recipients of Medicaid because existing
60 law imposes similar requirements of the Medicaid program; and (2) coverage provided by a
61 managed care organization to members of the Public Employees’ Benefits Program. (NRS
62 422.4053) Section 41 of this bill makes the requirements of section 36 inapplicable to
63 coverage provided by the Public Employees’ Benefits Program to its members. Section 34 of
64 this bill authorizes the Commissioner to suspend or revoke the certificate of a health
65 maintenance organization that fails to comply with the requirements of section 32. The
66 Commissioner would also be authorized to take such action against other third party insurers
67 who fail to comply with the requirements of sections 25, 27-32, 35 and 36. (NRS 680A.200)
68 Section 17 of this bill prohibits a pharmacy benefit manager from: (1) unreasonably
69 obstructing or interfering with the ability of a covered person to timely access a prescription
70 drug at certain pharmacies; (2) agreeing to exclusively cover certain drugs; (3) restricting the
71 ability of a nonaffiliated pharmacy to contract with certain entities; and (4) making or
72 disseminating a false or misleading statement or advertisement. Section 24 of this bill

Senate Amendment No. 848 to Senate Bill No. 316 First Reprint Page 5
73 additionally prohibits a pharmacy benefit manager from engaging in certain practices while
74 doing business with pharmacies.
75 Section 19 of this bill requires a pharmacy benefit manager to submit to the
76 Commissioner an annual report detailing certain business practices of the pharmacy benefit
77 manager as well as certain information regarding pricing and rebates relating to the
78 prescription drugs administered by the pharmacy benefit manager. Section 1 of this bill
79 requires third party insurers that provide coverage for prescription drugs to submit a
80 similar report to the Commissioner relating to the pricing of prescription drugs. Section 39 of
81 this bill provides for the confidentiality of the information contained in those reports. Sections
82 1 and 19 require the Commissioner to compile, submit to the Legislature and publish on the
83 Internet biennial reports on the impact of the cost of prescription drugs on health insurance
84 premiums in this State and the overall impact of pharmacy benefit managers on the cost of
85 prescription drugs in this State, based on the reports submitted by third party insurers and
86 pharmacy benefit managers, respectively. Additionally, section 18 of this bill requires the
87 Commissioner to publish on the Internet certain consumer complaints made against pharmacy
88 benefit managers.
89 Existing law exempts certain federally regulated insurance coverage of prescription drugs
90 provided by employers for their employees from requirements governing pharmacy benefit
91 managers except where the pharmacy benefit manager is required by contract to comply with
92 those requirements. (NRS 683A.177) Section 22 of this bill provides that such federally
93 regulated coverage provided by employers for their employees is also exempt from the
94 requirements of this bill governing pharmacy benefit managers, unless required by contract to
95 comply with those requirements. Additionally, sections 21.5 and 22 of this bill exempt
96 coverage of prescription drugs provided by the Public Employees’ Benefits Program ,
97 insurance plans for local government employees and Medicaid managed care organizations
98 from the requirements of this bill governing pharmacy benefit managers.
99 Existing law provides that a pharmacy benefit manager has an obligation of good faith
100 and fair dealing toward a third party insurer or pharmacy when performing duties pursuant to
101 a contract to which the pharmacy benefit manager is a party. (NRS 683A.178) Section 23 of
102 this bill provides that a pharmacy benefit manager also has a fiduciary duty to persons covered
103 by a third party insurer for which the pharmacy benefit manager provides pharmacy benefit
104 services. Section 23 also: (1) prohibits a pharmacy benefit manager from engaging in an
105 activity that may interfere with the duties and obligations of the pharmacy benefit manager
106 towards third party insurers, pharmacies and covered persons; and (2) authorizes a third party
107 insurer to audit the books and records of a pharmacy benefit manager for certain purposes.
108 Section 18 provides that a pharmacy benefit manager that violates provisions of law
109 governing pharmacy benefit managers, including sections 3-24, is subject to a civil penalty of
110 not less than $1,000 but not more than $7,500 for each violation.
111 [Existing law defines various activities involving businesses and occupations that
112 constitute deceptive trade practices. (NRS 598.0915-589.0925) If a person engages in a
113 deceptive trade practice, the person may be subject to a civil action brought by certain persons
114 and certain civil and criminal penalties. (NRS 598.0999) Section 18 makes certain violations
115 of sections 15 and 24 a deceptive trade practice, thereby subjecting a violation of those
116 provisions to additional penalties. However, sections 18, 38 and 42 of this bill provide that
117 such violations do not give rise to a private right of action.] Additionally, any violation of
118 sections 3-24 would be a misdemeanor. (NRS 683A.490)

14 books and public records of a governmental entity must be open at all times during
15 office hours to inspection by any person, and may be fully copied or an abstract or
16 memorandum may be prepared from those public books and public records. Any
17 such copies, abstracts or memoranda may be used to supply the general public with

31 record that is not otherwise confidential.

35 electronic format or by means of an electronic medium if:
36 (a) The public record:
37 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
38 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
39 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by means of an
40 electronic medium would:
41 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
42 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential and that
43 cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from information that is not
44 otherwise confidential.
45 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who has legal
46 custody or control of a public record:
47 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the medium that
48 is requested because the officer, employee or agent has already prepared or would
49 prefer to provide the copy in a different medium.
50 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon request, prepare
51 the copy of the public record and shall not require the person who has requested the
52 copy to prepare the copy himself or herself.

43 2. If a school district offers group insurance to its officers and employees
44 pursuant to this section, members of the board of trustees of the school district must

50 body of the county, or of any school district, municipal corporation, political
