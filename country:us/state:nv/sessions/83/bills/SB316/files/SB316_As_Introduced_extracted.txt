provisions relating to pharmacy benefit managers;

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires a pharmacy benefit manager, which is an entity that
2 manages a pharmacy benefits plan, to obtain a certificate of registration as an
3 insurance administrator from the Commissioner of Insurance and comply with the
4 requirements that apply to insurance administrators generally. (NRS 683A.025,
5 683A.08522-683A.0893) Existing law additionally imposes certain requirements
6 specifically regulating the operation of pharmacy benefit managers. (NRS
7 683A.171-683A.179) Existing law defines “pharmacy benefits plan” to refer to
8 insurance coverage of prescription drugs. (NRS 683A.175) Section 21 of this bill
9 expands the scope of that definition to also refer to insurance coverage of
10 pharmacist services. Section 21 thereby expands the scope of provisions governing
-
*SB316*
– 2 –
11 pharmacy benefit managers to also apply to entities that manage such coverage.
12 Sections 3-14 of this bill define certain other terms relevant to pharmacy benefit
13 managers, and section 20 of this bill establishes the applicability of those
14 definitions. Section 15 of this bill prohibits a pharmacy benefit manager that
15 manages a pharmacy benefits plan which provides coverage through a network
16 from requiring a person to use a pharmacy affiliated with the pharmacy benefit
17 manager if there are other, nonaffiliated pharmacies in the network. Section 15
18 additionally prohibits a pharmacy benefit manager from engaging in certain
19 practices which are intended or have the effect of steering a person towards an
20 affiliated pharmacy instead of a nonaffiliated pharmacy in the network. Section 15
21 also prohibits a pharmacy benefit manager from discriminating against a
22 nonaffiliated pharmacy.
23 Section 16 of this bill requires a pharmacy benefit manager to disclose to a
24 third party insurer for which the pharmacy benefit manager manages a pharmacy
25 benefits plan: (1) the amounts and types of fees that the pharmacy benefit manager
26 charges the third party insurer for managing the plan or otherwise receives from
27 other entities, including rebates, in connection with managing the plan; and (2)
28 certain information relating to the clinical efficacy and evidence regarding the
29 inclusion or exclusion of certain drugs in a formulary. Section 16 additionally
30 requires a pharmacy benefit manager to make certain contracts available for
31 inspection by the Commissioner.
32 Existing law authorizes the Department of Health and Human Services to enter
33 into a contract with a pharmacy benefit manager to manage coverage of
34 prescription drugs under the State Plan for Medicaid and the Children’s Health
35 Insurance Program that requires the pharmacy benefit manager to provide to the
36 Department all rebates received for purchasing drugs in relation to those programs.
37 (NRS 422.4053) Section 16 imposes similar requirements for pharmacy benefit
38 managers that manage other pharmacy benefits plans. Specifically, section 16
39 requires a pharmacy benefit manager to provide the entire amount of any rebate the
40 pharmacy benefit manager receives in connection with providing pharmacy benefit
41 management services for a third party insurer that provides pharmacy coverage to
42 the third party insurer. Sections 25, 27-32, 35, 36, 40 and 41 of this bill require
43 certain third party insurers that provide coverage for prescription drugs to use any
44 rebate money received from a pharmacy benefit manager pursuant to section 16 for
45 the sole purpose of reducing premiums and eliminating or reducing cost-sharing
46 obligations of covered persons. Sections 25, 27-32, 35, 36, 40 and 41 also prohibit
47 third party insurers from imposing on an insured a cost-sharing obligation for a
48 prescription drug which is greater than the net amount that the third party insurer
49 pays for the drug. Section 26 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner to require a
50 domestic insurer that issues a policy of individual health insurance to a person
51 residing in another state to meet the requirements of section 25 in certain
52 circumstances. Sections 33 and 37 of this bill indicate that the requirements of
53 sections 32 and 36, respectively, are inapplicable to a managed care organization
54 that is providing coverage to recipients of Medicaid because existing law imposes
55 similar requirements of the Medicaid program. (NRS 422.4053) Section 34 of this
56 bill authorizes the Commissioner to suspend or revoke the certificate of a health
57 maintenance organization that fails to comply with the requirements of section 32.
58 The Commissioner would also be authorized to take such action against other third
59 party insurers who fail to comply with the requirements of sections 25, 27-32, 35
60 and 36. (NRS 680A.200)
61 Section 17 of this bill prohibits a pharmacy benefit manager from: (1)
62 unreasonably obstructing or interfering with the ability of a covered person to
63 timely access a prescription drug at certain pharmacies; (2) agreeing to exclusively
64 cover certain drugs; (3) restricting the ability of a nonaffiliated pharmacy to
65 contract with certain entities; and (4) making or disseminating a false or misleading
-

– 3 –
66 statement or advertisement. Section 24 of this bill additionally prohibits a
67 pharmacy benefit manager from engaging in certain practices while doing business
68 with pharmacies.
69 Section 19 of this bill requires a pharmacy benefit manager to submit to the
70 Commissioner an annual report detailing certain business practices of the pharmacy
71 benefit manager as well as certain information regarding pricing and rebates
72 relating to the prescription drugs administered by the pharmacy benefit manager.
73 Section 1 of this bill requires third party insurers to submit a similar report to the
74 Commissioner relating to the pricing of prescription drugs. Section 39 of this bill
75 provides for the confidentiality of the information contained in those reports.
76 Sections 1 and 19 require the Commissioner to compile, submit to the Legislature
77 and publish on the Internet biennial reports on the impact of the cost of prescription
78 drugs on health insurance premiums in this State and the overall impact of
79 pharmacy benefit managers on the cost of prescription drugs in this State, based on
80 the reports submitted by third party insurers and pharmacy benefit managers,
81 respectively. Additionally, section 18 of this bill requires the Commissioner to
82 publish on the Internet certain consumer complaints made against pharmacy benefit
83 managers.
84 Existing law exempts certain federally regulated insurance coverage of
85 prescription drugs provided by employers for their employees from requirements
86 governing pharmacy benefit managers except where the pharmacy benefit manager
87 is required by contract to comply with those requirements. (NRS 683A.177)
88 Section 22 of this bill provides that such federally regulated coverage provided by
89 employers for their employees is also exempt from the requirements of this bill
90 governing pharmacy benefit managers, unless required by contract to comply with
91 those requirements.
92 Existing law provides that a pharmacy benefit manager has an obligation of
93 good faith and fair dealing toward a third party insurer or pharmacy when
94 performing duties pursuant to a contract to which the pharmacy benefit manager is
95 a party. (NRS 683A.178) Section 23 of this bill provides that a pharmacy benefit
96 manager also has an obligation to act with care, skill, prudence, diligence and
97 professionalism towards persons covered by a third party insurer when providing
98 pharmacy benefit services pursuant to a contract with the third party insurer.
99 Section 18 provides that a pharmacy benefit manager that violates provisions of
100 law governing pharmacy benefit managers, including sections 3-24, is subject to a
101 civil penalty of not less than $1,000 but not more than $7,500 for each violation.
102 Existing law defines various activities involving businesses and occupations
103 that constitute deceptive trade practices. (NRS 598.0915-589.0925) If a person
104 engages in a deceptive trade practice, the person may be subject to a civil action
105 brought by certain persons and certain civil and criminal penalties. (NRS 598.0999)
106 Section 18 makes certain violations of sections 15 and 24 a deceptive trade
107 practice, thereby subjecting a violation of those provisions to additional penalties.
108 However, sections 18, 38 and 42 of this bill provide that such violations do not
109 give rise to a private right of action.

S.B. 316
SENATE BILL NO. 316–SENATORS NGUYEN, STONE, TITUS;
CRUZ-CRAWFORD, DALY, OHRENSCHALL AND SCHEIBLE
MARCH 11, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Commerce and Labor
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to insurance.
(BDR 57-777)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
CONTAINS UNFUNDED MANDATE (§ 39)
(NOT REQUESTED BY AFFECTED LOCAL GOVERNMENT)
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to insurance; requiring health insurers, pharmacy
benefit managers and the Commissioner of Insurance to
prepare certain reports; expanding the scope of certain
provisions relating to pharmacy benefit managers;
prohibiting pharmacy benefit managers from engaging in
certain practices; requiring pharmacy benefit managers to
make certain disclosures; requiring pharmacy benefit
managers to pass rebates along to certain insurers and
insureds; requiring certain insurers to use passed-along
rebate funds for certain purposes; prohibiting insurers
from assessing certain cost-sharing obligations in certain
circumstances; providing civil and criminal penalties; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires a pharmacy benefit manager, which is an entity that
2 manages a pharmacy benefits plan, to obtain a certificate of registration as an
3 insurance administrator from the Commissioner of Insurance and comply with the
4 requirements that apply to insurance administrators generally. (NRS 683A.025,
5 683A.08522-683A.0893) Existing law additionally imposes certain requirements
6 specifically regulating the operation of pharmacy benefit managers. (NRS
7 683A.171-683A.179) Existing law defines “pharmacy benefits plan” to refer to
8 insurance coverage of prescription drugs. (NRS 683A.175) Section 21 of this bill
9 expands the scope of that definition to also refer to insurance coverage of
10 pharmacist services. Section 21 thereby expands the scope of provisions governing
-
*SB316*

– 2 –
11 pharmacy benefit managers to also apply to entities that manage such coverage.
12 Sections 3-14 of this bill define certain other terms relevant to pharmacy benefit
13 managers, and section 20 of this bill establishes the applicability of those
14 definitions. Section 15 of this bill prohibits a pharmacy benefit manager that
15 manages a pharmacy benefits plan which provides coverage through a network
16 from requiring a person to use a pharmacy affiliated with the pharmacy benefit
17 manager if there are other, nonaffiliated pharmacies in the network. Section 15
18 additionally prohibits a pharmacy benefit manager from engaging in certain
19 practices which are intended or have the effect of steering a person towards an
20 affiliated pharmacy instead of a nonaffiliated pharmacy in the network. Section 15
21 also prohibits a pharmacy benefit manager from discriminating against a
22 nonaffiliated pharmacy.
23 Section 16 of this bill requires a pharmacy benefit manager to disclose to a
24 third party insurer for which the pharmacy benefit manager manages a pharmacy
25 benefits plan: (1) the amounts and types of fees that the pharmacy benefit manager
26 charges the third party insurer for managing the plan or otherwise receives from
27 other entities, including rebates, in connection with managing the plan; and (2)
28 certain information relating to the clinical efficacy and evidence regarding the
29 inclusion or exclusion of certain drugs in a formulary. Section 16 additionally
30 requires a pharmacy benefit manager to make certain contracts available for
31 inspection by the Commissioner.
32 Existing law authorizes the Department of Health and Human Services to enter
33 into a contract with a pharmacy benefit manager to manage coverage of
34 prescription drugs under the State Plan for Medicaid and the Children’s Health
35 Insurance Program that requires the pharmacy benefit manager to provide to the
36 Department all rebates received for purchasing drugs in relation to those programs.
37 (NRS 422.4053) Section 16 imposes similar requirements for pharmacy benefit
38 managers that manage other pharmacy benefits plans. Specifically, section 16
39 requires a pharmacy benefit manager to provide the entire amount of any rebate the
40 pharmacy benefit manager receives in connection with providing pharmacy benefit
41 management services for a third party insurer that provides pharmacy coverage to
42 the third party insurer. Sections 25, 27-32, 35, 36, 40 and 41 of this bill require
43 certain third party insurers that provide coverage for prescription drugs to use any
44 rebate money received from a pharmacy benefit manager pursuant to section 16 for
45 the sole purpose of reducing premiums and eliminating or reducing cost-sharing
46 obligations of covered persons. Sections 25, 27-32, 35, 36, 40 and 41 also prohibit
47 third party insurers from imposing on an insured a cost-sharing obligation for a
48 prescription drug which is greater than the net amount that the third party insurer
49 pays for the drug. Section 26 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner to require a
50 domestic insurer that issues a policy of individual health insurance to a person
51 residing in another state to meet the requirements of section 25 in certain
52 circumstances. Sections 33 and 37 of this bill indicate that the requirements of
53 sections 32 and 36, respectively, are inapplicable to a managed care organization
54 that is providing coverage to recipients of Medicaid because existing law imposes
55 similar requirements of the Medicaid program. (NRS 422.4053) Section 34 of this
56 bill authorizes the Commissioner to suspend or revoke the certificate of a health
57 maintenance organization that fails to comply with the requirements of section 32.
58 The Commissioner would also be authorized to take such action against other third
59 party insurers who fail to comply with the requirements of sections 25, 27-32, 35
60 and 36. (NRS 680A.200)
61 Section 17 of this bill prohibits a pharmacy benefit manager from: (1)
62 unreasonably obstructing or interfering with the ability of a covered person to
63 timely access a prescription drug at certain pharmacies; (2) agreeing to exclusively
64 cover certain drugs; (3) restricting the ability of a nonaffiliated pharmacy to
65 contract with certain entities; and (4) making or disseminating a false or misleading
-

– 3 –
66 statement or advertisement. Section 24 of this bill additionally prohibits a
67 pharmacy benefit manager from engaging in certain practices while doing business
68 with pharmacies.
69 Section 19 of this bill requires a pharmacy benefit manager to submit to the
70 Commissioner an annual report detailing certain business practices of the pharmacy
71 benefit manager as well as certain information regarding pricing and rebates
72 relating to the prescription drugs administered by the pharmacy benefit manager.
73 Section 1 of this bill requires third party insurers to submit a similar report to the
74 Commissioner relating to the pricing of prescription drugs. Section 39 of this bill
75 provides for the confidentiality of the information contained in those reports.
76 Sections 1 and 19 require the Commissioner to compile, submit to the Legislature
77 and publish on the Internet biennial reports on the impact of the cost of prescription
78 drugs on health insurance premiums in this State and the overall impact of
79 pharmacy benefit managers on the cost of prescription drugs in this State, based on
80 the reports submitted by third party insurers and pharmacy benefit managers,
81 respectively. Additionally, section 18 of this bill requires the Commissioner to
82 publish on the Internet certain consumer complaints made against pharmacy benefit
83 managers.
84 Existing law exempts certain federally regulated insurance coverage of
85 prescription drugs provided by employers for their employees from requirements
86 governing pharmacy benefit managers except where the pharmacy benefit manager
87 is required by contract to comply with those requirements. (NRS 683A.177)
88 Section 22 of this bill provides that such federally regulated coverage provided by
89 employers for their employees is also exempt from the requirements of this bill
90 governing pharmacy benefit managers, unless required by contract to comply with
91 those requirements.
92 Existing law provides that a pharmacy benefit manager has an obligation of
93 good faith and fair dealing toward a third party insurer or pharmacy when
94 performing duties pursuant to a contract to which the pharmacy benefit manager is
95 a party. (NRS 683A.178) Section 23 of this bill provides that a pharmacy benefit
96 manager also has an obligation to act with care, skill, prudence, diligence and
97 professionalism towards persons covered by a third party insurer when providing
98 pharmacy benefit services pursuant to a contract with the third party insurer.
99 Section 18 provides that a pharmacy benefit manager that violates provisions of
100 law governing pharmacy benefit managers, including sections 3-24, is subject to a
101 civil penalty of not less than $1,000 but not more than $7,500 for each violation.
102 Existing law defines various activities involving businesses and occupations
103 that constitute deceptive trade practices. (NRS 598.0915-589.0925) If a person
104 engages in a deceptive trade practice, the person may be subject to a civil action
105 brought by certain persons and certain civil and criminal penalties. (NRS 598.0999)
106 Section 18 makes certain violations of sections 15 and 24 a deceptive trade
107 practice, thereby subjecting a violation of those provisions to additional penalties.
108 However, sections 18, 38 and 42 of this bill provide that such violations do not
109 give rise to a private right of action.
