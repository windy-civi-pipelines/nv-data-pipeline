AN ACT relating to domestic violence; establishing the Hope Card Program for

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes a person to file an application for a temporary or extended order
2 for protection against domestic violence. (NRS 33.017-33.100) Section 1 of this bill
3 establishes the Hope Card Program, which will be developed and administered by the Office
4 of the Attorney General, after consultation and in coordination with the district courts and
5 justice courts, to provide to an applicant who has been granted an extended order for
6 protection against domestic violence, upon request, a Hope Card that provides proof of the
7 granting of such an extended order. Section 1 also prohibits a person from knowingly
8 presenting a fraudulent or expired Hope Card to another person with the specific intent to
9 falsely represent that the person is protected by an extended order.
10 Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to apply the definitions in existing law
11 to section 1.
12 Section 3 of this bill requires an applicant for an extended order for protection against
13 domestic violence to indicate in the application whether the applicant is requesting a Hope
14 Card.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

4 2. The Hope Card Program must ensure than an applicant who has been

33 Violence Hotline.
34 5. A person who knowingly presents a fraudulent or expired Hope Card to
35 another person with the specific intent to falsely represent that the person is
36 protected by an extended order is guilty of a misdemeanor.
37 Sec. 2. NRS 33.017 is hereby amended to read as follows:
38 33.017 As used in NRS 33.017 to 33.100, inclusive, and section 1 of this act,
39 unless the context otherwise requires:
40 1. “Extended order” means an extended order for protection against domestic
41 violence.
42 2. “Temporary order” means a temporary order for protection against
43 domestic violence.
44 Sec. 3. NRS 33.020 is hereby amended to read as follows:
45 33.020 1. If it appears to the satisfaction of the court from specific facts
46 shown by a verified application that an act of domestic violence has occurred or
47 there exists a threat of domestic violence, the court may grant a temporary or
48 extended order. A court shall only consider whether the act of domestic violence or
49 the threat thereof satisfies the requirements of NRS 33.018 without considering any
50 other factor in its determination to grant the temporary or extended order.
51 2. A temporary or extended order must not be granted to the applicant or the
52 adverse party unless the applicant or the adverse party has requested the order and
53 has filed a verified application that an act of domestic violence has occurred or

Assembly Amendment No. 201 to Assembly Bill No. 159 Page 5
1 there exists a threat of domestic violence. An applicant for an extended order shall
2 indicate in the application whether the applicant is requesting the Office of the
3 Attorney General to provide a Hope Card to the applicant in accordance with the
4 provisions of section 1 of this act if the court grants the extended order. If the
5 applicant reasonably believes that disclosing his or her address and contact
6 information in the application would jeopardize his or her safety, the applicant may
7 decline to disclose his or her address and contact information in the application. If
8 the applicant declines to disclose his or her address and contact information in the
9 application, then such information:
10 (a) Must be disclosed to the court and, for criminal justice purposes, to any
11 other authorized agency of criminal justice to allow the agency of criminal justice
12 to carry out any duty required pursuant to NRS 33.017 to 33.100, inclusive;
13 (b) Must be maintained in a separate, confidential, electronic document or
14 database which is not publicly accessible; and
15 (c) Must not be released, disclosed or made accessible to the public, except as
16 authorized by the court.
17 3. The court may require the applicant or the adverse party, or both, to appear
18 before the court before determining whether to grant the temporary or extended
19 order.
20 4. A temporary order may be granted with or without notice to the adverse
21 party. An extended order may only be granted after notice to the adverse party and
22 a hearing on the application.
23 5. A hearing on an application for an extended order must be held within 45
24 days after the date on which the application for the extended order is filed. If the
25 adverse party has not been served pursuant to NRS 33.060 or 33.065 and fails to
26 appear at the hearing, the court may, upon a showing that law enforcement, after
27 due diligence, has been unable to serve the adverse party or that the adverse party
28 has sought to avoid service by concealment, set a date for a second hearing which
29 must be held within 90 days after the date on which the first hearing was scheduled.
30 6. If the adverse party has not been served pursuant to NRS 33.060 or 33.065
31 and fails to appear on the date set for a second hearing on an application for an
32 extended order pursuant to subsection 5, the court may, upon a showing that law
33 enforcement, after due diligence, has been unable to serve the adverse party or that
34 the adverse party has sought to avoid service by concealment, set a date for a third
35 hearing which must be held within 90 days after the date on which the second
36 hearing was scheduled.
37 7. The court shall rule upon an application for a temporary order within 1
38 judicial day after it is filed.
39 8. If it appears to the satisfaction of the court from specific facts
40 communicated by electronic means to the court by an alleged victim that an act of
41 domestic violence has occurred and the alleged perpetrator of the domestic violence
42 has been arrested and is presently in custody pursuant to NRS 171.137, the court
43 may grant a temporary order. Before approving an order under such circumstances,
44 the court shall confirm with the appropriate law enforcement agency that the
45 applicant is an alleged victim and that the alleged perpetrator is in custody. Upon
46 approval by the court, the signed order may be transmitted to the facility where the
47 alleged perpetrator is in custody by electronic or telephonic transmission to a
48 facsimile machine. If such an order is received by the facility holding the alleged
49 perpetrator while the alleged perpetrator is still in custody, the order must be
50 personally served by an authorized employee of the facility before the alleged
51 perpetrator is released. The court shall mail a copy of each order issued pursuant to
52 this subsection to the alleged victim named in the order and cause the original order
53 to be filed with the court clerk on the first judicial day after it is issued.
