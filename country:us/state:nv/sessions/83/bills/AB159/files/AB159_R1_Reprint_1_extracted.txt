8 33.017 As used in NRS 33.017 to 33.100, inclusive, and
9 section 1 of this act, unless the context otherwise requires:

12 2. “Temporary order” means a temporary order for protection
13 against domestic violence.
14 Sec. 3. NRS 33.020 is hereby amended to read as follows:

18 the court may grant a temporary or extended order. A court shall

15 date on which the first hearing was scheduled.
16 6. If the adverse party has not been served pursuant to NRS

23 the date on which the second hearing was scheduled.
24 7. The court shall rule upon an application for a temporary
25 order within 1 judicial day after it is filed.

28 victim that an act of domestic violence has occurred and the alleged
29 perpetrator of the domestic violence has been arrested and is
30 presently in custody pursuant to NRS 171.137, the court may grant a
31 temporary order. Before approving an order under such
32 circumstances, the court shall confirm with the appropriate law
33 enforcement agency that the applicant is an alleged victim and that
34 the alleged perpetrator is in custody. Upon approval by the court, the
35 signed order may be transmitted to the facility where the alleged
36 perpetrator is in custody by electronic or telephonic transmission to
37 a facsimile machine. If such an order is received by the facility
38 holding the alleged perpetrator while the alleged perpetrator is still
39 in custody, the order must be personally served by an authorized
40 employee of the facility before the alleged perpetrator is released.
41 The court shall mail a copy of each order issued pursuant to this
