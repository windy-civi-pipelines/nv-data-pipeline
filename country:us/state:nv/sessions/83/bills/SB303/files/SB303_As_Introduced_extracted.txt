AN ACT relating to civil liability; revising provisions relating to

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides that, with certain exceptions, an owner of any estate or
2 interest in any premises, or a lessee or an occupant of any premises, owes no duty
3 to: (1) keep the premises safe for entry or use by others for participating in any
4 recreational activity; or (2) give warning of any hazardous condition, activity or use
5 of any structure on the premises to persons entering to participate in recreational
6 activity. Existing law also provides that if an owner, lessee or occupant of premises
7 gives permission to another person to participate in recreational activities upon
8 those premises: (1) the owner, lessee or occupant does not assure that the premises
9 are safe for that purpose or assume responsibility for or incur liability for any injury
10 to person or property caused by any act of persons to whom the permission is
11 granted; and (2) the person using the premises does not acquire any property rights
12 in or rights of easement to the premises. (NRS 41.510)
13 This bill: (1) provides that the law regarding this limitation on liability may be
14 known and cited as the Recreational Use of Land Statute; and (2) provides a
15 declaration of legislative intent regarding the purpose of the Recreational Use of
16 Land Statute. This bill also revises the applicability of this limitation on liability by
17 specifically providing that the limitation on liability: (1) does not limit the liability
18 which would otherwise exist for injury caused by any act of an occupant of the
19 premises who receives compensation from the owner or lessee of the premises to
20 maintain, develop or improve the premises or any portion thereof; and (2) does not
21 apply to residential common areas or urban public infrastructure.
