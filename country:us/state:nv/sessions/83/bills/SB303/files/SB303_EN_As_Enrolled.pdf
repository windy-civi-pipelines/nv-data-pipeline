Senate Bill No. 303–Committee on Judiciary
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to civil liability; revising provisions relating to
civil liability to persons using certain premises for
recreational activity under certain circumstances; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law provides that, with certain exceptions, an owner of any estate or
interest in any premises, or a lessee or an occupant of any premises, owes no duty
to: (1) keep the premises safe for entry or use by others for participating in any
recreational activity; or (2) give warning of any hazardous condition, activity or use
of any structure on the premises to persons entering to participate in recreational
activity. Existing law also provides that if an owner, lessee or occupant of premises
gives permission to another person to participate in recreational activities upon
those premises: (1) the owner, lessee or occupant does not assure that the premises
are safe for that purpose or assume responsibility for or incur liability for any injury
to person or property caused by any act of persons to whom the permission is
granted; and (2) the person using the premises does not acquire any property rights
in or rights of easement to the premises. (NRS 41.510)
This bill: (1) provides that the law regarding this limitation on liability may be
known and cited as the Recreational Use of Land Statute; and (2) provides a
declaration of legislative intent regarding the purpose of the Recreational Use of
Land Statute. This bill also limits the liability of the State of Nevada, and any
political subdivision thereof, for any injury to a person engaging in recreational
activity if the premises: (1) are included in any recreational plan or other similar
land use plan; (2) are designated to be used for recreational activity by the
governing body of a public entity or a designee of the governing body of a public
entity; or (3) consist of any portion of a public road, highway, street, alley or
sidewalk forming part of a trail, equestrian path, shared-use path or other similar
trail or path. Additionally, this bill limits the liability of a nonprofit entity that owns
certain land for any injury to a person engaging in recreational activity on the
premises if such premises remain open to the public for free and consist of: (1) a
trail or interconnected trail system of 100 miles or more which is entirely owned by
the nonprofit entity and which is designated for recreational purposes; (2) a park
which is 10 acres or more in area and which is designated for recreational purposes;
or (3) a wash that is preserved pursuant to a federal permit. Furthermore, this bill
limits the liability of an owner, lessee or occupant of rural or semi-rural non-
residential land for any injury to a person who enters or uses the premises to engage
in recreational activity. Finally, this bill provides that if any court order grants or
denies immunity from liability to the State of Nevada, or any political subdivision
thereof, an interlocutory appeal lies to the Supreme Court.
