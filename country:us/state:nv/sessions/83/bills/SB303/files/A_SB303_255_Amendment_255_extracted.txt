EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to civil liability; revising provisions relating to civil liability to
persons using certain premises for recreational activity under certain
circumstances; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides that, with certain exceptions, an owner of any estate or interest in
2 any premises, or a lessee or an occupant of any premises, owes no duty to: (1) keep the
3 premises safe for entry or use by others for participating in any recreational activity; or (2)
4 give warning of any hazardous condition, activity or use of any structure on the premises to
5 persons entering to participate in recreational activity. Existing law also provides that if an
6 owner, lessee or occupant of premises gives permission to another person to participate in
7 recreational activities upon those premises: (1) the owner, lessee or occupant does not assure
8 that the premises are safe for that purpose or assume responsibility for or incur liability for
9 any injury to person or property caused by any act of persons to whom the permission is
10 granted; and (2) the person using the premises does not acquire any property rights in or rights
11 of easement to the premises. (NRS 41.510)
12 This bill: (1) provides that the law regarding this limitation on liability may be known and
13 cited as the Recreational Use of Land Statute; and (2) provides a declaration of legislative
14 intent regarding the purpose of the Recreational Use of Land Statute. This bill also revises the
15 applicability of this limitation on liability by specifically providing that the limitation on
16 liability [: (1)] does not limit the liability which would otherwise exist for : (1) injury caused
17 by any act of an occupant of the premises who receives compensation from the owner or
18 lessee of the premises to maintain, develop or improve the premises or any portion thereof;
19 [and] (2) injury caused by acts or omissions of a private entity or person occupying or
20 leasing premises from the State of Nevada, or any political subdivision thereof; or (3)
21 injury caused by acts or omissions of a private owner, lessee or occupant of a residential
22 common area, urban premises or public infrastructure. This bill also provides that the
23 limitation on liability does not apply to : (1) residential common areas [or urban] ; (2) public
24 infrastructure [.] ; or (3) the State of Nevada, or any political subdivision thereof, for any
25 premises it owns, leases or occupies which are not intended to be used solely for the
26 purposes of recreational activity.
