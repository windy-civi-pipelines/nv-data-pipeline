EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to civil liability; revising provisions relating to civil liability to
persons using certain premises for recreational activity under certain
circumstances; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides that, with certain exceptions, an owner of any estate or interest in
2 any premises, or a lessee or an occupant of any premises, owes no duty to: (1) keep the
3 premises safe for entry or use by others for participating in any recreational activity; or (2)
4 give warning of any hazardous condition, activity or use of any structure on the premises to
5 persons entering to participate in recreational activity. Existing law also provides that if an
6 owner, lessee or occupant of premises gives permission to another person to participate in
7 recreational activities upon those premises: (1) the owner, lessee or occupant does not assure
8 that the premises are safe for that purpose or assume responsibility for or incur liability for
9 any injury to person or property caused by any act of persons to whom the permission is
10 granted; and (2) the person using the premises does not acquire any property rights in or rights
11 of easement to the premises. (NRS 41.510)
12 This bill: (1) provides that the law regarding this limitation on liability may be known and
13 cited as the Recreational Use of Land Statute; and (2) provides a declaration of legislative
14 intent regarding the purpose of the Recreational Use of Land Statute. This bill also [revises the
15 applicability of this limitation on liability by specifically providing that the limitation on
16 liability does not limit the liability which would otherwise exist for: (1) injury caused by any
17 act of an occupant of the premises who receives compensation from the owner or lessee of the
18 premises to maintain, develop or improve the premises or any portion thereof; (2) injury
19 caused by acts or omissions of a private entity or person occupying or leasing premises from
20 the State of Nevada, or any political subdivision thereof; or (3) injury caused by acts or
21 omissions of a private owner, lessee or occupant of a residential common area, urban premises
22 or public infrastructure. This bill also provides that the limitation on liability does not apply
23 to: (1) residential common areas; (2) public infrastructure; or (3) the State of Nevada, or any
24 political subdivision thereof, for any premises it owns, leases or occupies which are not
25 intended to be used solely for the purposes of recreational activity.] limits the liability of the
26 State of Nevada, and any political subdivision thereof, for any injury to a person
27 engaging in recreational activity if the premises: (1) are included in any recreational
28 plan or other similar land use plan; (2) are designated to be used for recreational activity
29 by the governing body of a public entity or a designee of the governing body of a public
30 entity; or (3) consist of any portion of a public road, highway, street, alley or sidewalk
Assembly Amendment No. 575 to Senate Bill No. 303 First Reprint Page 4
31 forming part of a trail, equestrian path, shared-use path or other similar trail or path.
32 Additionally, this bill limits the liability of a nonprofit entity that owns certain land for
33 any injury to a person engaging in recreational activity on the premises if such premises
34 remain open to the public for free and consist of: (1) a trail or interconnected trail
35 system of 100 miles or more which is entirely owned by the nonprofit entity and which is
36 designated for recreational purposes; (2) a park which is 10 acres or more in area and
37 which is designated for recreational purposes; or (3) a wash that is preserved pursuant
38 to a federal permit. Furthermore, this bill limits the liability of an owner, lessee or
39 occupant of rural or semi-rural non-residential land for any injury to a person who
40 enters or uses the premises to engage in recreational activity. Finally, this bill provides
41 that if any court order grants or denies immunity from liability to the State of Nevada,
42 or any political subdivision thereof, an interlocutory appeal lies to the Supreme Court.
