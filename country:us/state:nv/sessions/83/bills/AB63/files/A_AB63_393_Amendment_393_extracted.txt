SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to civil actions for wrongful conviction.
(BDR 3-440)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to actions concerning persons; revising provisions relating to civil
actions for wrongful conviction; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes a person who is not currently incarcerated for any offense to
2 bring a civil action for his or her wrongful conviction against this State in a district court
3 seeking damages or other relief. (NRS [41.900)] 41.900-41.970) Section 1 of this bill [instead
4 authorizes a person who is not currently in custody to bring such a civil action.] defines the
5 term “incarcerated” for such purposes.
6 Existing law also requires, among other things, that a person seeking such damages
7 or other relief prove by a preponderance of the evidence that: (1) the person’s conviction
8 was reversed or vacated and his or her charges were dismissed; (2) the basis for
9 reversing or vacating the conviction was not legal error that was unrelated to his or her
10 innocence, and if a new trial was ordered, the person was found not guilty at the new
11 trial or the person was not retried and his or her charges were dismissed; or (3) the
12 person was pardoned by the State Board of Pardons Commissioners on the grounds that
13 the person was innocent. (NRS 41.900) Section 1.5 of this bill makes technical changes
14 relating to when a conviction is reversed or vacated.
15 If a person brings an action for wrongful conviction which results in the court entering a
16 certificate of innocence, existing law requires the court to award monetary damages based
17 upon the length of time for which the person was imprisoned and for which the person was on
18 parole or required to register as a sex offender. Existing law additionally authorizes the court
19 to award, in addition to monetary damages, reasonable attorney’s fees, certain reimbursements
20 and, subject to a limitation of $100,000 in a calendar year, payment for the cost of: (1) tuition,
21 books and fees for the person to enroll in any course or academic program at an institution
22 operated by the Nevada System of Higher Education; (2) participation in Medicare or
23 Medicaid or a qualified health plan; (3) programs for reentry into the community; (4)
24 counseling services; (5) housing assistance; and (6) programs for assistance for financial
25 literacy. Finally, existing law also authorizes the court to award any other relief, which is not
26 subject to the limitation of $100,000 in a calendar year. (NRS 41.950) Section 2 of this bill
27 makes any other relief awarded by the court subject to the limitation of $100,000 in a calendar
28 year.
