Referred to Committee on Judiciary
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to civil actions for
wrongful conviction. (BDR 3-440)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to actions concerning persons; revising provisions
relating to civil actions for wrongful conviction; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes a person who is not currently incarcerated for any
2 offense to bring a civil action for his or her wrongful conviction against this State in
3 a district court seeking damages or other relief. (NRS 41.900-41.970) Section 1 of
4 this bill defines the term “incarcerated” for such purposes.
5 Existing law also requires, among other things, that a person seeking such
6 damages or other relief prove by a preponderance of the evidence that: (1) the
7 person’s conviction was reversed or vacated and his or her charges were dismissed;
8 (2) the basis for reversing or vacating the conviction was not legal error that was
9 unrelated to his or her innocence, and if a new trial was ordered, the person was
10 found not guilty at the new trial or the person was not retried and his or her charges
11 were dismissed; or (3) the person was pardoned by the State Board of Pardons
12 Commissioners on the grounds that the person was innocent. (NRS 41.900) Section
13 1.5 of this bill makes technical changes relating to when a conviction is reversed or
14 vacated.
15 If a person brings an action for wrongful conviction which results in the court
16 entering a certificate of innocence, existing law requires the court to award
17 monetary damages based upon the length of time for which the person was
18 imprisoned and for which the person was on parole or required to register as a sex
19 offender. Existing law additionally authorizes the court to award, in addition to
20 monetary damages, reasonable attorney’s fees, certain reimbursements and, subject
21 to a limitation of $100,000 in a calendar year, payment for the cost of: (1) tuition,
22 books and fees for the person to enroll in any course or academic program at an
23 institution operated by the Nevada System of Higher Education; (2) participation in
24 Medicare or Medicaid or a qualified health plan; (3) programs for reentry into the
-

25 community; (4) counseling services; (5) housing assistance; and (6) programs for
26 assistance for financial literacy. Finally, existing law also authorizes the court to
27 award any other relief, which is not subject to the limitation of $100,000 in a
28 calendar year. (NRS 41.950) Section 2 of this bill makes any other relief awarded
29 by the court subject to the limitation of $100,000 in a calendar year.
30 Section 3 of this bill clarifies that the amendatory provisions of this bill apply
31 to an action for wrongful conviction that is filed on or after the effective date of this
32 bill.
