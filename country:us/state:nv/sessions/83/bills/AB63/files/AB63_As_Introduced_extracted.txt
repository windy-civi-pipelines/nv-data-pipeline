EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to actions concerning persons; revising provisions
relating to civil actions for wrongful conviction; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes a person who is not currently incarcerated for any
2 offense to bring a civil action for his or her wrongful conviction against this State in
3 a district court seeking damages or other relief. (NRS 41.900) Section 1 of this bill
4 instead authorizes a person who is not currently in custody to bring such a civil
5 action.
6 If a person brings an action for wrongful conviction which results in the court
7 entering a certificate of innocence, existing law requires the court to award
8 monetary damages based upon the length of time for which the person was
9 imprisoned and for which the person was on parole or required to register as a sex
10 offender. Existing law additionally authorizes the court to award, in addition to
11 monetary damages, reasonable attorney’s fees, certain reimbursements and, subject
12 to a limitation of $100,000 in a calendar year, payment for the cost of: (1) tuition,
13 books and fees for the person to enroll in any course or academic program at an
14 institution operated by the Nevada System of Higher Education; (2) participation in
15 Medicare or Medicaid or a qualified health plan; (3) programs for reentry into the
16 community; (4) counseling services; (5) housing assistance; and (6) programs for
17 assistance for financial literacy. Finally, existing law also authorizes the court to
18 award any other relief, which is not subject to the limitation of $100,000 in a
19 calendar year. (NRS 41.950) Section 2 of this bill makes any other relief awarded
20 by the court subject to the limitation of $100,000 in a calendar year.
21 Section 3 of this bill clarifies that the amendatory provisions of this bill apply
22 to an action for wrongful conviction that is filed on or after the effective date of this
23 bill.
