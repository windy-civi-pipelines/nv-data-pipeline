Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law, with certain exceptions, makes it a civil infraction to manually
2 type or enter text into a cellular telephone or other handheld wireless
3 communications device, or to send or read data using any such device to access or
4 search the Internet, while operating a motor vehicle. In addition, existing law, with
5 certain exceptions, makes it a civil infraction to use a cellular telephone or other
6 handheld wireless communications device to engage in voice communications with
7 another person while operating a motor vehicle, unless such device is used with a
8 hands-free accessory. (NRS 484B.165)
9 Under existing law, a person who violates these prohibitions against the use of
10 a cellular telephone or other handheld wireless communications device while
11 operating a motor vehicle is subject to a civil penalty of $50 for a first violation
12 within the immediately preceding 7 years, $100 for the second violation within the
13 immediately preceding 7 years and $250 for the third or subsequent violation
14 within the immediately preceding 7 years. (NRS 484B.165) If the violation is
15 committed in certain work zones or traffic control zones, or in a school zone,

16 existing law imposes an additional penalty for the violation. (NRS 484B.130,
17 484B.135, 484B.165)
18 This bill makes it a civil infraction for a person who is less than 18 years of age
19 to use a cellular telephone or handheld wireless communications device for any
20 purpose while operating a motor vehicle, including, without limitation, engaging in
21 voice communications with another person, regardless of whether or not a hands-
22 free accessory is used, except in certain emergency circumstances or when using a
23 voice-operated global positioning or navigation system that is affixed to the
24 vehicle. Under this bill, a peace officer is: (1) prohibited from stopping a motor
25 vehicle for the sole purpose of determining whether a person is violating such
26 provisions; and (2) authorized to issue a civil infraction citation for such a violation
27 only if the violation is discovered while the vehicle is stopped or the driver is
28 arrested for another offense. A person who violates this bill is subject to the same
29 civil penalties as a person who violates the existing prohibition against the use of a
30 cellular telephone or other handheld wireless communications device while
31 operating a motor vehicle. (NRS 484B.130, 484B.135, 484B.165)
