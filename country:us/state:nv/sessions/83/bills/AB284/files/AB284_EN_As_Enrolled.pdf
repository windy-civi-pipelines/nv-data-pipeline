stimulation therapy device prescribed for the treatment of epilepsy; and (2) any
replacement part for such a device. Section 2 also clarifies that the rates of
reimbursement established for the cost of a vagus nerve stimulation therapy device
and any replacement part for such a device must be separate from and in addition to

of such a device or the replacement of a part for the device. Section 1 of this bill
makes an appropriation to and authorizes expenditures by the Division of Health
