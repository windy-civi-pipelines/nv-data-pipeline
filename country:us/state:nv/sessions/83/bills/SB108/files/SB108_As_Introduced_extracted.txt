3 requires that the money in this Account be used to award grants under the Program to
4 cities, counties and other political subdivisions of this State and tribal governments in
5 this State as equivalent matching money for projects for the clearance, maintenance,
6 restoration, surveying and monumenting of navigable rivers. Under existing law, the
7 State Engineer is required to administer the Account and the Program. (NRS 532.220,
8 532.230) Existing law also creates the Contingency Account in the State General
9 Fund and prescribes a procedure for allocation of money in that Account by the
10 Interim Finance Committee, upon the recommendation of the State Board of
11 Examiners, for prescribed purposes, including as provided in specific statute. (NRS
12 353.266, 353.268, 353.269) Under existing law, the State Engineer is required to
13 request an allocation from the Contingency Account if the balance in the Account for
14 the Channel Clearance, Maintenance, Restoration, Surveying and Monumenting
15 Program is not sufficient to provide a grant under the Program. In addition, the State
16 Engineer is authorized to request an allocation from the Contingency Account if the
17 balance in the Account for the Channel Clearance, Maintenance, Restoration,
18 Surveying and Monumenting Program is below $250,000. (NRS 532.230) This bill:
19 (1) increases this balance for triggering discretionary requests from the Contingency
20 Account to $500,000; and (2) provides that only money in the Account for the
21 Channel Clearance, Maintenance, Restoration, Surveying and Monumenting Program
22 that is not committed for expenditure is included in the calculation of that balance.
