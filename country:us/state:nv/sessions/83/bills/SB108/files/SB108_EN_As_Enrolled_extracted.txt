Section 1:
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to water; revising provisions governing the
Account for the Channel Clearance, Maintenance,
Restoration, Surveying and Monumenting Program; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law: (1) creates the Account for the Channel Clearance, Maintenance,
Restoration, Surveying and Monumenting Program in the State General Fund; and
(2) requires that the money in this Account be used to award grants under the
Program to cities, counties and other political subdivisions of this State and tribal
governments in this State as equivalent matching money for projects for the
clearance, maintenance, restoration, surveying and monumenting of navigable
rivers. Under existing law, the State Engineer is required to administer the Account
and the Program. (NRS 532.220, 532.230) Existing law also creates the
Contingency Account in the State General Fund and prescribes a procedure for
allocation of money in that Account by the Interim Finance Committee, upon the
recommendation of the State Board of Examiners, for prescribed purposes,
including as provided in specific statute. (NRS 353.266, 353.268, 353.269) Under
existing law, the State Engineer is required to request an allocation from the
Contingency Account if the balance in the Account for the Channel Clearance,
Maintenance, Restoration, Surveying and Monumenting Program is not sufficient
to provide a grant under the Program. In addition, the State Engineer is authorized
to request an allocation from the Contingency Account if the balance in the
Account for the Channel Clearance, Maintenance, Restoration, Surveying and
Monumenting Program is below $250,000. (NRS 532.230) This bill: (1) increases
this balance for triggering discretionary requests from the Contingency Account to
$500,000; and (2) provides that only money in the Account for the Channel
Clearance, Maintenance, Restoration, Surveying and Monumenting Program that is
not committed for expenditure is included in the calculation of that balance.
