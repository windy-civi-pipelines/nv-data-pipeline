pursuant to the provisions of NRS 218E.150 and the Joint Standing
Rules of the Legislature, Senators Nicole Cannizzaro, Melanie
Scheible, Skip Daly, Rochelle Nguyen, Ira Hansen and Robin L.
Titus are designated as the regular Senate members of the
Legislative Commission; and be it further
RESOLVED, That Senators Marilyn Dondero Loop and Fabian
Doñate are designated as the first and second alternate members,
respectively, for Senator Nicole Cannizzaro; Senators Dina Neal and
Julie Pazina are designated as the first and second alternate
members, respectively, for Senator Melanie Scheible; Senators
Roberta Lange and James Ohrenschall are designated as the first and
second alternate members, respectively, for Senator Skip Daly;
Senators Edgar Flores and Angie Taylor are designated as the first
and second alternate members, respectively, for Senator Rochelle
Nguyen; Senators Jeff Stone and Lori Rogich are designated as the
first and second alternate members, respectively, for Senator Ira
Hansen; and Senators John Steinbeck and John Ellison are
designated as the first and second alternate members, respectively,
for Senator Robin L. Titus; and be it further
RESOLVED, That the procedure for requesting an alternate
member to replace a regular member during his or her absence at a
meeting must be as follows:
1. The Secretary of the Legislative Commission shall establish
a record of service of alternate members at meetings of the
Legislative Commission and shall maintain a list of the alternate
members for each individual Senator or group of Senators. Each list
must contain a numerical designation in ascending order for each
alternate member on the list. The initial sequence in which the
alternate members must be listed must correspond to their
designation as alternates in this resolution.
2. If a regular member of the Legislative Commission is unable
to attend a scheduled meeting of the Legislative Commission and
notifies the Secretary of the Legislative Commission, the Secretary
shall request the alternate member with the lowest numerical
designation on the appropriate list to replace the regular member at

the meeting. If the alternate member does not agree to serve, the
Secretary shall make the same request of the alternate member with
the next higher numerical designation on the list, and so on through
the list until an alternate member agrees to replace the regular
member.
3. An alternate member who agrees to replace a regular
member at a meeting of the Legislative Commission loses the
numerical designation he or she had on the appropriate list at
the time he or she was requested to serve. The Secretary of the
Legislative Commission shall, when the alternate member agrees to
replace the regular member, assign to that alternate member the
highest numerical designation on the appropriate list. At the same
time, the Secretary shall also reduce by one the numerical
designation on the appropriate list to those alternate members who
have higher numerical designations on the appropriate list than the
alternate member who has agreed to serve.
4. An alternate member who is requested to replace a regular
member at a meeting of the Legislative Commission, but who does
not agree to replace the regular member, does not lose the numerical
designation he or she had on the appropriate list at the time of the
request.
And be it further
RESOLVED, That this resolution becomes effective upon
adoption.
