1 RESOLVED, That the procedure for requesting an alternate
2 member to replace a regular member during his or her absence at a
3 meeting must be as follows:
4 1. The Secretary of the Legislative Commission shall establish
5 a record of service of alternate members at meetings of the
6 Legislative Commission and shall maintain a list of the alternate
7 members for each individual Senator or group of Senators. Each list
8 must contain a numerical designation in ascending order for each
9 alternate member on the list. The initial sequence in which the
10 alternate members must be listed must correspond to their
11 designation as alternates in this resolution.
12 2. If a regular member of the Legislative Commission is unable
13 to attend a scheduled meeting of the Legislative Commission and
14 notifies the Secretary of the Legislative Commission, the Secretary
15 shall request the alternate member with the lowest numerical
16 designation on the appropriate list to replace the regular member at
17 the meeting. If the alternate member does not agree to serve, the
18 Secretary shall make the same request of the alternate member with
19 the next higher numerical designation on the list, and so on through
20 the list until an alternate member agrees to replace the regular
21 member.
22 3. An alternate member who agrees to replace a regular
23 member at a meeting of the Legislative Commission loses the
24 numerical designation he or she had on the appropriate list at
25 the time he or she was requested to serve. The Secretary of the
26 Legislative Commission shall, when the alternate member agrees to
27 replace the regular member, assign to that alternate member the
28 highest numerical designation on the appropriate list. At the same
29 time, the Secretary shall also reduce by one the numerical
30 designation on the appropriate list to those alternate members who
31 have higher numerical designations on the appropriate list than the
32 alternate member who has agreed to serve.
33 4. An alternate member who is requested to replace a regular
34 member at a meeting of the Legislative Commission, but who does
35 not agree to replace the regular member, does not lose the numerical
36 designation he or she had on the appropriate list at the time of the
37 request.
38 And be it further
39 RESOLVED, That this resolution becomes effective upon
40 adoption.
