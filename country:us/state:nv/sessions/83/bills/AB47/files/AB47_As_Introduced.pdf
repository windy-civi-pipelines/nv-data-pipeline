AN ACT relating to education; requiring money in the Education
Stabilization Account that exceeds a certain percentage of
appropriations and authorizations from the State
Education Fund to be used to make allocations to school
districts for the retention, recruitment and training of
educational personnel; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates the Education Stabilization Account in the State Education
2 Fund and authorizes money in the Account to be transferred to the State Education
3 Fund under certain circumstances that create a shortfall of revenue in the State
4 Education Fund. Under existing law, certain amounts are required to be transferred
5 to the Account, but the balance in the Account is prohibited from exceeding 20
6 percent of the total of all appropriations and authorizations from the State
7 Education Fund, excluding the Account, for the immediately preceding fiscal year.
8 Existing law requires any money transferred to the Account which exceeds this
9 amount to instead be transferred to the State Education Fund. (NRS 387.1213) This
10 bill requires that any money transferred to the Account which exceeds this amount
11 instead be transferred to the Department of Education for allocation to each school
12 district in this State in an amount that is proportional to the number of pupils
13 enrolled in the school district, as compared to the total number of pupils enrolled in
14 a school district in this State. This bill requires: (1) the board of trustees of each
15 school district to submit to the Department a plan for the expenditure of such
16 money; and (2) such money to be used for the retention, recruitment, training and
17 professional development of teachers and other educational personnel. Finally, this
18 bill requires the superintendent of each school district to submit a report to the
19 Department, on or before November 1 of each fiscal year following a fiscal year in

20 which the school district receives such money, regarding the use of such money in
21 the immediately preceding fiscal year and the success of efforts to retain, recruit,
22 train and provide professional development to teachers and other educational
23 personnel.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 387.1213 is hereby amended to read as
2 follows:
3 387.1213 1. The Education Stabilization Account is hereby
4 created in the State Education Fund. Except as otherwise provided
5 in this section, each year after the close of the previous fiscal year
6 and before the issuance of the State Controller’s annual report, each
7 county school district shall transfer from the county school district
8 fund to the Education Stabilization Account any amount by which
9 the actual ending fund balance of the county school district fund
10 exceeds 16.6 percent of the total actual expenditures for the fund.
11 The interest and income earned on the money in the Account, after
12 deducting any applicable charges, must be credited to the Account.
13 2. Money transferred pursuant to subsection 1 to the Education
14 Stabilization Account is a continuing appropriation solely for the
15 purpose of authorizing the expenditure of the transferred money for
16 the purposes set forth in this section.
17 3. The balance in the Education Stabilization Account must not
18 exceed 20 percent of the total of all appropriations and
19 authorizations from the State Education Fund, excluding the
20 Education Stabilization Account, for the immediately preceding
21 fiscal year. Any money transferred to the Education Stabilization
22 Account which exceeds this amount must instead be transferred to
23 the [State Education Fund.] Department for allocation to each
24 county school district in this State in an amount that is
25 proportional to the number of pupils enrolled in the county school
26 district, as compared to the total number of pupils enrolled in a
27 county school district in this State. If money is allocated to
28 a county school district in a fiscal year, the board of trustees of the
29 county school district shall submit to the Department a plan for
30 the expenditure of money allocated to the county school district
31 pursuant to this subsection. If the Superintendent of Public
32 Instruction determines that the county school district will use the
33 money allocated to it pursuant to this subsection for the purposes
34 set forth in this subsection and will comply with the requirements
35 of subsection 8, the Superintendent of Public Instruction shall
36 direct the State Controller to transfer to each county school district
37 the amount of money allocated to it pursuant to this subsection.
