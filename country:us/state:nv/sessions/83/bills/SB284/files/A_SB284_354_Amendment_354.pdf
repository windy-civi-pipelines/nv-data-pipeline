EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to child welfare; requiring an agency which provides child
welfare services to take certain measures to facilitate the payment of
certain benefits to which a child in the custody of the agency is
entitled; revising the manner in which an agency which provides child
welfare services is required to maintain and use certain benefits and
awards received on behalf of such a child; requiring an agency which
provides child welfare services to provide certain training and
information to certain children and other persons interested in the
welfare of the child; requiring an agency which provides child welfare
services to report certain information to a court; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires that all benefits for survivors or other awards payable to a child
2 receiving child welfare services: (1) in a county whose population is less than 100,000
3 (currently all counties other than Clark and Washoe Counties) be deposited in the State
4 Treasury for credit to the Trust Fund for Child Welfare; or (2) in a county whose population is
5 100,000 or more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties) be deposited in a trust fund for child
6 welfare established in the county treasury. Existing law requires the Division of Child and
7 Family Services of the Department of Health and Human Services to use money in the Trust
8 Fund for Child Welfare to pay for any services provided to the child to whom the benefits or
9 awards were payable with public money. Existing law authorizes the agency which provides
10 child welfare services in a county whose population is 100,000 or more to use the money in
11 the trust fund for child welfare in the county treasury to pay for such services. (NRS 432.037)
12 Section 6 of this bill repeals those provisions.
13 Section 1 of this bill requires an agency which provides child welfare services to
14 determine if each child in the custody of the agency is receiving or is eligible to receive
15 federal benefits administered by the Social Security Administration or the United States
16 Department of Veterans Affairs. If a child is eligible to receive such federal benefits, section 1
17 requires the agency which provides child welfare services to promptly apply for the federal

Senate Amendment No. 354 to Senate Bill No. 284 Page 4
18 benefits on behalf of the child. If the agency which provides child welfare services applies for
19 such federal benefits on behalf of a child in its custody or if such a child is receiving such
20 federal benefits, section 1 requires the agency to: (1) determine whether there is a person who
21 may be the representative payee for the child for the purpose of receiving such federal
22 benefits; and (2) if no person is suitable, apply to the Federal Government to be the
23 representative payee for the child. If the agency which provides child welfare services is
24 approved to be the representative payee for the child, section 1 additionally requires the
25 agency to: (1) establish an account for the purpose of using and conserving the federal
26 benefits and any other benefits or awards received on behalf of the child; (2) perform an
27 accounting of the use, application or conservation of all benefits that the agency receives on
28 behalf of the child every 6 months; and (3) notify and consult with certain persons associated
29 with the child concerning applications for and the use of federal benefits. Section 1 also
30 requires the agency to provide financial counseling to a child who is in the custody of the
31 agency, is receiving benefits and is 14 years of age or older.
32 Section 1 prohibits an agency which provides child welfare services that serves as the
33 representative payee for a child from using any benefits, awards or assets belonging to a child
34 to pay for the costs of the care of the child. Section 1 requires an agency which provides child
35 welfare services that is the representative payee for a child to periodically assess whether there
36 is a more suitable person to serve as the representative payee for the child, consult with certain
37 interested persons as to whether the person is suitable for that role and, if so, assist the person
38 in applying to be the representative payee. If a person assumes the role of representative
39 payee, section 1 requires the agency to provide certain training to the person and request from
40 the person certain documents relating to the accounting of funds of the child. Upon ceasing to
41 serve as the representative payee for a child, section 1 requires an agency which provides
42 child welfare services to remit any balance in the account maintained on behalf of the child or
43 transfer control over the account in accordance with any requirements imposed by the source
44 of the money or, if no such requirements exist, to: (1) the new representative payee or the
45 parent or legal guardian of the child; or (2) if the child is emancipated or has reached 18 years
46 of age, the child. Sections 1 and 3 of this bill require an agency which provides child welfare
47 services to submit to a court overseeing the case of a child in its custody who is receiving
48 federal benefits certain documentation on the accounting of those benefits. Section 2 of this
49 bill makes a conforming change to indicate the proper placement of section 1 in the Nevada
50 Revised Statutes.
51 Section 4 of this bill requires the Division to, on or before [July 1, 2025,] January 1,
52 2026, close each account in the Trust Fund and: (1) if the Division is the representative payee
53 for the child for which the account was maintained, deposit the money into an account
54 maintained pursuant to section 1; or (2) if the Division is not the representative payee for the
55 child, remit the balance of the account in accordance with any requirements imposed by the
56 source of the money or, if no such requirements exist, to the new representative payee, the
57 parent or guardian of the child or the child, depending on the circumstances. Section 4
58 requires an agency which provides child welfare services in a county whose population is
59 100,000 or more to take similar action with regard to the trust fund for child welfare in the
60 county treasury.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 432 of NRS is hereby amended by adding thereto a new
2 section to read as follows:
3 1. Not later than 60 days after a child is placed in the custody of an agency

6 eligible to receive federal benefits.
7 2. If an agency which provides child welfare services determines pursuant
8 to subsection 1 that a child is eligible to receive federal benefits but is not

Senate Amendment No. 354 to Senate Bill No. 284 Page 5
1 currently receiving such benefits, the agency which provides child welfare
2 services shall promptly apply for the federal benefits on behalf of the child.
3 3. If a child in the custody of an agency which provides child welfare
4 services is receiving federal benefits or if the agency which provides child welfare
5 services applies for federal benefits on behalf of the child pursuant to subsection
6 2, the agency which provides child welfare services shall:
7 (a) Determine, in consultation with the child, any parent whose rights have
8 not been terminated and the attorney for the child, whether there is a person who
9 is suitable to be the representative payee for the child in accordance with 20
10 C.F.R. §§ 404.2021 and 416.621; and
11 (b) If there is no person who is suitable to be the representative payee for the
12 child, apply to be the representative payee for the child pursuant to 20 C.F.R. §§
13 404.2024 and 416.624 and deposit the federal benefits into an account established
14 pursuant to subsection 4.
15 4. If an agency which provides child welfare services is the representative
16 payee for a child, the agency which provides child welfare services shall:
17 (a) Establish an account that is appropriate to use and conserve the federal
18 benefits and any other benefits or awards received on behalf of the child. An
19 account established pursuant to this paragraph may be, without limitation:
20 (1) A special needs trust;
21 (2) A pooled special needs trust;
22 (3) An ABLE account described in section 592A of the Internal Revenue
23 Code, 26 U.S.C. § 529A; or
24 (4) Any other trust account that will not interfere with the eligibility of
25 the child for any benefits provided by the Federal Government, this State or an
26 agency or political subdivision of this State.
27 (b) Regularly meet with the child and the attorney for the child to discuss the
28 federal benefits and ascertain the needs of the child, including, without
29 limitation, needs related to the future plans of a child who is 14 years of age or
30 older once he or she reaches the age of majority.
31 (c) If the child is 14 years of age or older, provide financial counseling to the
32 child on preserving his or her eligibility for benefits, the use of the benefits for
33 the needs of the child in accordance with subsection 5 and planning for future
34 needs that are foreseeable.
35 5. An agency which provides child welfare services that is the representative
36 payee for a child shall not use any federal benefits or other benefits, awards or
37 assets belonging to a child to pay for or reimburse the agency which provides
38 child welfare services or any other state or local governmental agency for costs of
39 the child’s care. The agency which provides child welfare services may use such
40 money in the specific interests of the child, as determined in cooperation with the
41 child and attorney for the child, for costs not covered by the agency as part of the
42 child’s care or by the health insurance of the child.
43 6. In addition to any accounting required by NRS 166A.310, an agency
44 which provides child welfare services that is the representative payee for a child
45 shall, at least once every 6 months, perform an accounting of the use, application
46 or conservation of all benefits received by the agency on behalf of the child and
47 provide documentation of the accounting to:
48 (a) The child;

5 benefits, any application pursuant to paragraph (b) of subsection 3 to be the
6 representative payee for the child or any decision or appeal related to such an
7 application.
8 8. If an application for federal benefits submitted by an agency which

12 (b) Appeal the denial if an appeal is in the best interests of the child.
13 9. An agency which provides child welfare services that is the representative
14 payee for a child shall periodically assess whether there is a person who is

17 determines that such a person exists, the agency which provides child welfare
18 services shall consult with the child, any parent whose rights have not been
19 terminated and the attorney for the child about the person identified. If after such
20 consultation, the agency continues to believe that the person is suitable to assume
21 the role of representative payee, the agency shall contact the person to support
22 him or her in applying to be the representative payee for the child.

(b) Deduct from the account any services to the child provided by public
money. Any surplus remaining may be expended for extraordinary items deemed
beneficial to the child.
(c) Remit any surplus balance to the parent or legal guardian of the child, or to
the child if the child is emancipated or has reached the age of 18 years, when the
Division is no longer legally responsible for the child.
3. The Division shall pay interest to each child’s separate account maintained
in the Trust Fund for Child Welfare at the end of each interest period. Interest must
be paid at a rate equal to the average of the interest rates quoted by at least three
banking institutions for interest-bearing savings accounts of $3,000 or less on the
first day of each interest period. Interest must be paid on the child’s account
commencing with the first interest period that the Division is legally responsible for
the child. Interest must not be paid for the interest period during which the child
ceases to be the legal responsibility of the Division.

4. All benefits for survivors or other awards payable to children receiving
child welfare services in a county whose population is 100,000 or more pursuant to
NRS 432.010 to 432.085, inclusive, must be deposited in the trust fund for child
welfare established in the county treasury. A disbursement from the benefits for
survivors or other awards of a child which is deposited in the fund may be made to
the agency which provides child welfare services for any child welfare services
provided to the child with public money.
5. As used in this section, “interest period” means that period not less
frequent than quarterly, as determined by the State Treasurer, for which interest
must be paid.
