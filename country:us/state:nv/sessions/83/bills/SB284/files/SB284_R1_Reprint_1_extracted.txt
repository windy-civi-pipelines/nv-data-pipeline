~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to child welfare; requiring an agency which
provides child welfare services to take certain measures to
facilitate the payment of certain benefits to which a child
in the custody of the agency is entitled; revising the
manner in which an agency which provides child welfare
services is required to maintain and use certain benefits
and awards received on behalf of such a child; requiring
an agency which provides child welfare services to
provide certain training and information to certain
children and other persons interested in the welfare of the
child; requiring an agency which provides child welfare
services to report certain information to a court; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires that all benefits for survivors or other awards payable to a
2 child receiving child welfare services: (1) in a county whose population is less than
3 100,000 (currently all counties other than Clark and Washoe Counties) be deposited
4 in the State Treasury for credit to the Trust Fund for Child Welfare; or (2) in a
5 county whose population is 100,000 or more (currently Clark and Washoe
6 Counties) be deposited in a trust fund for child welfare established in the county
7 treasury. Existing law requires the Division of Child and Family Services of the
8 Department of Health and Human Services to use money in the Trust Fund for
9 Child Welfare to pay for any services provided to the child to whom the benefits or
-
*SB284_R1*
– 2 –
10 awards were payable with public money. Existing law authorizes the agency which
11 provides child welfare services in a county whose population is 100,000 or more to
12 use the money in the trust fund for child welfare in the county treasury to pay for
13 such services. (NRS 432.037) Section 6 of this bill repeals those provisions.
14 Section 1 of this bill requires an agency which provides child welfare services
15 to determine if each child in the custody of the agency is receiving or is eligible to
16 receive federal benefits administered by the Social Security Administration or the
17 United States Department of Veterans Affairs. If a child is eligible to receive such
18 federal benefits, section 1 requires the agency which provides child welfare
19 services to promptly apply for the federal benefits on behalf of the child. If the
20 agency which provides child welfare services applies for such federal benefits on
21 behalf of a child in its custody or if such a child is receiving such federal benefits,
22 section 1 requires the agency to: (1) determine whether there is a person who may
23 be the representative payee for the child for the purpose of receiving such federal
24 benefits; and (2) if no person is suitable, apply to the Federal Government to be the
25 representative payee for the child. If the agency which provides child welfare
26 services is approved to be the representative payee for the child, section 1
27 additionally requires the agency to: (1) establish an account for the purpose of using
28 and conserving the federal benefits and any other benefits or awards received on
29 behalf of the child; (2) perform an accounting of the use, application or
30 conservation of all benefits that the agency receives on behalf of the child every 6
31 months; and (3) notify and consult with certain persons associated with the child
32 concerning applications for and the use of federal benefits. Section 1 also requires
33 the agency to provide financial counseling to a child who is in the custody of the
34 agency, is receiving benefits and is 14 years of age or older.
35 Section 1 prohibits an agency which provides child welfare services that serves
36 as the representative payee for a child from using any benefits, awards or assets
37 belonging to a child to pay for the costs of the care of the child. Section 1 requires
38 an agency which provides child welfare services that is the representative payee for
39 a child to periodically assess whether there is a more suitable person to serve as the
40 representative payee for the child, consult with certain interested persons as to
41 whether the person is suitable for that role and, if so, assist the person in applying
42 to be the representative payee. If a person assumes the role of representative payee,
43 section 1 requires the agency to provide certain training to the person and request
44 from the person certain documents relating to the accounting of funds of the child.
45 Upon ceasing to serve as the representative payee for a child, section 1 requires an
46 agency which provides child welfare services to remit any balance in the account
47 maintained on behalf of the child or transfer control over the account in accordance
48 with any requirements imposed by the source of the money or, if no such
49 requirements exist, to: (1) the new representative payee or the parent or legal
50 guardian of the child; or (2) if the child is emancipated or has reached 18 years of
51 age, the child. Sections 1 and 3 of this bill require an agency which provides child
52 welfare services to submit to a court overseeing the case of a child in its custody
53 who is receiving federal benefits certain documentation on the accounting of those
54 benefits. Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to indicate the proper
55 placement of section 1 in the Nevada Revised Statutes.
56 Section 4 of this bill requires the Division to, on or before January 1, 2026,
57 close each account in the Trust Fund and: (1) if the Division is the representative
58 payee for the child for which the account was maintained, deposit the money into
59 an account maintained pursuant to section 1; or (2) if the Division is not the
60 representative payee for the child, remit the balance of the account in accordance
61 with any requirements imposed by the source of the money or, if no such
62 requirements exist, to the new representative payee, the parent or guardian of the
63 child or the child, depending on the circumstances. Section 4 requires an agency
64 which provides child welfare services in a county whose population is 100,000 or
-
*SB284_R1*
– 3 –
65 more to take similar action with regard to the trust fund for child welfare in the
66 county treasury.

4 of an agency which provides child welfare services and annually
5 thereafter, the agency which provides child welfare services shall
6 determine whether the child is receiving or is eligible to receive
7 federal benefits.
8 2. If an agency which provides child welfare services

10 receive federal benefits but is not currently receiving such
11 benefits, the agency which provides child welfare services shall
12 promptly apply for the federal benefits on behalf of the child.
13 3. If a child in the custody of an agency which provides child
14 welfare services is receiving federal benefits or if the agency which
15 provides child welfare services applies for federal benefits on
16 behalf of the child pursuant to subsection 2, the agency which
17 provides child welfare services shall:
18 (a) Determine, in consultation with the child, any parent
19 whose rights have not been terminated and the attorney for the

22 404.2021 and 416.621; and
23 (b) If there is no person who is suitable to be the representative

26 the federal benefits into an account established pursuant to

31 (a) Establish an account that is appropriate to use and
32 conserve the federal benefits and any other benefits or awards

17 or other benefits, awards or assets belonging to a child to pay for
18 or reimburse the agency which provides child welfare services or
19 any other state or local governmental agency for costs of the
20 child’s care. The agency which provides child welfare services
21 may use such money in the specific interests of the child, as
22 determined in cooperation with the child and attorney for the
23 child, for costs not covered by the agency as part of the child’s
24 care or by the health insurance of the child.
25 6. In addition to any accounting required by NRS 166A.310,
26 an agency which provides child welfare services that is the
27 representative payee for a child shall, at least once every 6 months,

SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to child welfare.
(BDR 38-747)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
CONTAINS UNFUNDED MANDATE (§ 1)
(NOT REQUESTED BY AFFECTED LOCAL GOVERNMENT)
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to child welfare; requiring an agency which
provides child welfare services to take certain measures to
facilitate the payment of certain benefits to which a child
in the custody of the agency is entitled; revising the
manner in which an agency which provides child welfare
services is required to maintain and use certain benefits
and awards received on behalf of such a child; requiring
an agency which provides child welfare services to
provide certain training and information to certain
children and other persons interested in the welfare of the
child; requiring an agency which provides child welfare
services to report certain information to a court; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires that all benefits for survivors or other awards payable to a
2 child receiving child welfare services: (1) in a county whose population is less than
3 100,000 (currently all counties other than Clark and Washoe Counties) be deposited
4 in the State Treasury for credit to the Trust Fund for Child Welfare; or (2) in a
5 county whose population is 100,000 or more (currently Clark and Washoe
6 Counties) be deposited in a trust fund for child welfare established in the county
7 treasury. Existing law requires the Division of Child and Family Services of the
8 Department of Health and Human Services to use money in the Trust Fund for
9 Child Welfare to pay for any services provided to the child to whom the benefits or
-
*SB284_R1*

– 2 –
10 awards were payable with public money. Existing law authorizes the agency which
11 provides child welfare services in a county whose population is 100,000 or more to
12 use the money in the trust fund for child welfare in the county treasury to pay for
13 such services. (NRS 432.037) Section 6 of this bill repeals those provisions.
14 Section 1 of this bill requires an agency which provides child welfare services
15 to determine if each child in the custody of the agency is receiving or is eligible to
16 receive federal benefits administered by the Social Security Administration or the
17 United States Department of Veterans Affairs. If a child is eligible to receive such
18 federal benefits, section 1 requires the agency which provides child welfare
19 services to promptly apply for the federal benefits on behalf of the child. If the
20 agency which provides child welfare services applies for such federal benefits on
21 behalf of a child in its custody or if such a child is receiving such federal benefits,
22 section 1 requires the agency to: (1) determine whether there is a person who may
23 be the representative payee for the child for the purpose of receiving such federal
24 benefits; and (2) if no person is suitable, apply to the Federal Government to be the
25 representative payee for the child. If the agency which provides child welfare
26 services is approved to be the representative payee for the child, section 1
27 additionally requires the agency to: (1) establish an account for the purpose of using
28 and conserving the federal benefits and any other benefits or awards received on
29 behalf of the child; (2) perform an accounting of the use, application or
30 conservation of all benefits that the agency receives on behalf of the child every 6
31 months; and (3) notify and consult with certain persons associated with the child
32 concerning applications for and the use of federal benefits. Section 1 also requires
33 the agency to provide financial counseling to a child who is in the custody of the
34 agency, is receiving benefits and is 14 years of age or older.
35 Section 1 prohibits an agency which provides child welfare services that serves
36 as the representative payee for a child from using any benefits, awards or assets
37 belonging to a child to pay for the costs of the care of the child. Section 1 requires
38 an agency which provides child welfare services that is the representative payee for
39 a child to periodically assess whether there is a more suitable person to serve as the
40 representative payee for the child, consult with certain interested persons as to
41 whether the person is suitable for that role and, if so, assist the person in applying
42 to be the representative payee. If a person assumes the role of representative payee,
43 section 1 requires the agency to provide certain training to the person and request
44 from the person certain documents relating to the accounting of funds of the child.
45 Upon ceasing to serve as the representative payee for a child, section 1 requires an
46 agency which provides child welfare services to remit any balance in the account
47 maintained on behalf of the child or transfer control over the account in accordance
48 with any requirements imposed by the source of the money or, if no such
49 requirements exist, to: (1) the new representative payee or the parent or legal
50 guardian of the child; or (2) if the child is emancipated or has reached 18 years of
51 age, the child. Sections 1 and 3 of this bill require an agency which provides child
52 welfare services to submit to a court overseeing the case of a child in its custody
53 who is receiving federal benefits certain documentation on the accounting of those
54 benefits. Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to indicate the proper
55 placement of section 1 in the Nevada Revised Statutes.
56 Section 4 of this bill requires the Division to, on or before January 1, 2026,
57 close each account in the Trust Fund and: (1) if the Division is the representative
58 payee for the child for which the account was maintained, deposit the money into
59 an account maintained pursuant to section 1; or (2) if the Division is not the
60 representative payee for the child, remit the balance of the account in accordance
61 with any requirements imposed by the source of the money or, if no such
62 requirements exist, to the new representative payee, the parent or guardian of the
63 child or the child, depending on the circumstances. Section 4 requires an agency
64 which provides child welfare services in a county whose population is 100,000 or
-
*SB284_R1*

– 3 –
65 more to take similar action with regard to the trust fund for child welfare in the
66 county treasury.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 432 of NRS is hereby amended by adding
2 thereto a new section to read as follows:
3 1. Not later than 60 days after a child is placed in the custody
4 of an agency which provides child welfare services and annually
5 thereafter, the agency which provides child welfare services shall
6 determine whether the child is receiving or is eligible to receive
7 federal benefits.
8 2. If an agency which provides child welfare services
9 determines pursuant to subsection 1 that a child is eligible to
10 receive federal benefits but is not currently receiving such
11 benefits, the agency which provides child welfare services shall
12 promptly apply for the federal benefits on behalf of the child.
13 3. If a child in the custody of an agency which provides child
14 welfare services is receiving federal benefits or if the agency which
15 provides child welfare services applies for federal benefits on
16 behalf of the child pursuant to subsection 2, the agency which
17 provides child welfare services shall:
18 (a) Determine, in consultation with the child, any parent
19 whose rights have not been terminated and the attorney for the
20 child, whether there is a person who is suitable to be the
21 representative payee for the child in accordance with 20 C.F.R. §§
22 404.2021 and 416.621; and
23 (b) If there is no person who is suitable to be the representative
24 payee for the child, apply to be the representative payee for the
25 child pursuant to 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.2024 and 416.624 and deposit
26 the federal benefits into an account established pursuant to
27 subsection 4.
28 4. If an agency which provides child welfare services is the
29 representative payee for a child, the agency which provides child
30 welfare services shall:
31 (a) Establish an account that is appropriate to use and
32 conserve the federal benefits and any other benefits or awards
33 received on behalf of the child. An account established pursuant
34 to this paragraph may be, without limitation:
35 (1) A special needs trust;
36 (2) A pooled special needs trust;
37 (3) An ABLE account described in section 592A of the
38 Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. § 529A; or
-
*SB284_R1*

– 4 –
1 (4) Any other trust account that will not interfere with the
2 eligibility of the child for any benefits provided by the Federal
3 Government, this State or an agency or political subdivision of this
4 State.
5 (b) Regularly meet with the child and the attorney for the child
6 to discuss the federal benefits and ascertain the needs of the child,
7 including, without limitation, needs related to the future plans of a
8 child who is 14 years of age or older once he or she reaches the
9 age of majority.
10 (c) If the child is 14 years of age or older, provide financial
11 counseling to the child on preserving his or her eligibility for
12 benefits, the use of the benefits for the needs of the child in
13 accordance with subsection 5 and planning for future needs that
14 are foreseeable.
15 5. An agency which provides child welfare services that is the
16 representative payee for a child shall not use any federal benefits
17 or other benefits, awards or assets belonging to a child to pay for
18 or reimburse the agency which provides child welfare services or
19 any other state or local governmental agency for costs of the
20 child’s care. The agency which provides child welfare services
21 may use such money in the specific interests of the child, as
22 determined in cooperation with the child and attorney for the
23 child, for costs not covered by the agency as part of the child’s
24 care or by the health insurance of the child.
25 6. In addition to any accounting required by NRS 166A.310,
26 an agency which provides child welfare services that is the
27 representative payee for a child shall, at least once every 6 months,
28 perform an accounting of the use, application or conservation of
29 all benefits received by the agency on behalf of the child and
30 provide documentation of the accounting to:
31 (a) The child;
32 (b) Any parent of the child whose parental rights have not
33 been terminated;

35 (d) The attorney for the child; and
36 (e) A court, as required by NRS 432B.580.
37 7. An agency which provides child welfare services that has

40 terminated, the legal guardian of the child and the attorney for the
41 child of any application, decision or appeal related to benefits, any
42 application pursuant to paragraph (b) of subsection 3 to be the
43 representative payee for the child or any decision or appeal related
44 to such an application.
-
*SB284_R1*

5 (b) Appeal the denial if an appeal is in the best interests of the
6 child.
7 9. An agency which provides child welfare services that is the
8 representative payee for a child shall periodically assess whether
9 there is a person who is suitable to assume the role of
10 representative payee and who would better serve the best interests
11 of the child. If the agency which provides child welfare services
12 determines that such a person exists, the agency which provides
13 child welfare services shall consult with the child, any parent
14 whose rights have not been terminated and the attorney for the
15 child about the person identified. If after such consultation, the
16 agency continues to believe that the person is suitable to assume
17 the role of representative payee, the agency shall contact the
18 person to support him or her in applying to be the representative
19 payee for the child.

21 pursuant to subsection 3 or 9 for a child who is in the custody of
22 an agency which provides child welfare services, the agency shall:
23 (a) Provide training to the representative payee relating to:

27 (3) Utilizing and accounting for the benefits of the child;
28 (b) While the child remains in the custody of the agency,
29 require the representative payee to:
30 (1) Perform an accounting every 6 months of the use,
31 application or conservation of all benefits received by the
32 representative payee on behalf of the child; and
33 (2) Provide documentation of each accounting performed
34 pursuant to subparagraph (1) to the agency; and
35 (c) Include any documentation provided pursuant to
36 paragraph (b) in a report submitted to a court pursuant to
37 NRS 432B.580.
38 11. An agency which provides child welfare services that

21 13. An agency which provides child welfare services shall
22 provide appropriate training to employees of the agency who are
23 involved in the performance of the duties set forth in this section,
24 including, without limitation, training on how to establish,
25 monitor and use appropriate financial accounts to maintain

TEXT OF REPEALED SECTION
432.037 Creation of Trust Fund for Child Welfare; duties
of Division; deposit of money in trust fund for child welfare
established in county treasury in certain counties and
disbursement from fund.
1. The Trust Fund for Child Welfare is hereby created. All
benefits for survivors or other awards payable to children receiving
child welfare services pursuant to NRS 432.010 to 432.085,
inclusive, in a county whose population is less than 100,000 must be
deposited in the State Treasury for credit to the Fund.
2. The Division shall:
(a) Keep a separate account for each child who receives money.
(b) Deduct from the account any services to the child provided
by public money. Any surplus remaining may be expended for
extraordinary items deemed beneficial to the child.
(c) Remit any surplus balance to the parent or legal guardian of
the child, or to the child if the child is emancipated or has reached
the age of 18 years, when the Division is no longer legally
responsible for the child.
3. The Division shall pay interest to each child’s separate
account maintained in the Trust Fund for Child Welfare at the end
of each interest period. Interest must be paid at a rate equal to the
average of the interest rates quoted by at least three banking
institutions for interest-bearing savings accounts of $3,000 or less
on the first day of each interest period. Interest must be paid on the
child’s account commencing with the first interest period that the
Division is legally responsible for the child. Interest must not be
paid for the interest period during which the child ceases to be the
legal responsibility of the Division.
4. All benefits for survivors or other awards payable to
children receiving child welfare services in a county whose
population is 100,000 or more pursuant to NRS 432.010 to 432.085,
inclusive, must be deposited in the trust fund for child welfare
established in the county treasury. A disbursement from the benefits
for survivors or other awards of a child which is deposited in the
fund may be made to the agency which provides child welfare
services for any child welfare services provided to the child with
public money.
