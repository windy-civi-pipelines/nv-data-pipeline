CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to child welfare; requiring an agency which
provides child welfare services to take certain measures to
facilitate the payment of certain benefits to which a child in
the custody of the agency is entitled; revising the manner in
which an agency which provides child welfare services is
required to maintain and use certain benefits and awards
received on behalf of such a child; requiring an agency which
provides child welfare services to provide certain training and
information to certain children and other persons interested in
the welfare of the child; requiring an agency which provides
child welfare services to report certain information to a court;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law requires that all benefits for survivors or other awards payable to a
child receiving child welfare services: (1) in a county whose population is less than
100,000 (currently all counties other than Clark and Washoe Counties) be deposited
in the State Treasury for credit to the Trust Fund for Child Welfare; or (2) in a
county whose population is 100,000 or more (currently Clark and Washoe
Counties) be deposited in a trust fund for child welfare established in the county
treasury. Existing law requires the Division of Child and Family Services of the
Department of Health and Human Services to use money in the Trust Fund for
Child Welfare to pay for any services provided to the child to whom the benefits or
awards were payable with public money. Existing law authorizes the agency which
provides child welfare services in a county whose population is 100,000 or more to
use the money in the trust fund for child welfare in the county treasury to pay for
such services. (NRS 432.037) Section 6 of this bill repeals those provisions.
Section 1 of this bill requires an agency which provides child welfare services
to determine if each child in the custody of the agency is receiving or is eligible to
receive federal benefits administered by the Social Security Administration or the
United States Department of Veterans Affairs. If a child is eligible to receive such
federal benefits, section 1 requires the agency which provides child welfare
services to promptly apply for the federal benefits on behalf of the child. If the
agency which provides child welfare services applies for such federal benefits on
behalf of a child in its custody or if such a child is receiving such federal benefits,
section 1 requires the agency to: (1) determine whether there is a person who may
be the representative payee for the child for the purpose of receiving such federal
benefits; and (2) if no person is suitable, apply to the Federal Government to be the
representative payee for the child. If the agency which provides child welfare
services is approved to be the representative payee for the child, section 1
additionally requires the agency to: (1) establish an account for the purpose of using
and conserving the federal benefits and any other benefits or awards received on
behalf of the child; (2) perform an accounting of the use, application or
conservation of all benefits that the agency receives on behalf of the child every 6
months; and (3) notify and consult with certain persons associated with the child
-

– 2 –
concerning applications for and the use of federal benefits. Section 1 also requires
the agency to provide financial counseling to a child who is in the custody of the
agency, is receiving benefits and is 14 years of age or older.
Section 1 prohibits an agency which provides child welfare services that serves
as the representative payee for a child from using any benefits, awards or assets
belonging to a child to pay for the costs of the care of the child. Section 1 requires
an agency which provides child welfare services that is the representative payee for
a child to periodically assess whether there is a more suitable person to serve as the
representative payee for the child, consult with certain interested persons as to
whether the person is suitable for that role and, if so, assist the person in applying
to be the representative payee. If a person assumes the role of representative payee,
section 1 requires the agency to provide certain training to the person and request
from the person certain documents relating to the accounting of funds of the child.
Upon ceasing to serve as the representative payee for a child, section 1 requires an
agency which provides child welfare services to remit any balance in the account
maintained on behalf of the child or transfer control over the account in accordance
with any requirements imposed by the source of the money or, if no such
requirements exist, to: (1) the new representative payee or the parent or legal
guardian of the child; or (2) if the child is emancipated or has reached 18 years of
age, the child. Sections 1 and 3 of this bill require an agency which provides child
welfare services to submit to a court overseeing the case of a child in its custody
who is receiving federal benefits certain documentation on the accounting of those
benefits. Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to indicate the proper
placement of section 1 in the Nevada Revised Statutes.
Section 4 of this bill requires the Division to, on or before January 1, 2026,
close each account in the Trust Fund and: (1) if the Division is the representative
payee for the child for which the account was maintained, deposit the money into
an account maintained pursuant to section 1; or (2) if the Division is not the
representative payee for the child, remit the balance of the account in accordance
with any requirements imposed by the source of the money or, if no such
requirements exist, to the new representative payee, the parent or guardian of the
child or the child, depending on the circumstances. Section 4 requires an agency
which provides child welfare services in a county whose population is 100,000 or
more to take similar action with regard to the trust fund for child welfare in the
county treasury.

3. If a child in the custody of an agency which provides child

provides child welfare services applies for federal benefits on

the federal benefits into an account established pursuant to
subsection 4.
4. If an agency which provides child welfare services is the
representative payee for a child, the agency which provides child

received on behalf of the child. An account established pursuant
to this paragraph may be, without limitation:

terminated, the legal guardian of the child and the attorney for the
child of any application, decision or appeal related to benefits, any
application pursuant to paragraph (b) of subsection 3 to be the

8. If an application for federal benefits submitted by an
agency which provides child welfare services on behalf of a child
is denied, the agency which provides child welfare services shall:
(a) Consult with the attorney for the child; and
(b) Appeal the denial if an appeal is in the best interests of the
child.
9. An agency which provides child welfare services that is the
representative payee for a child shall periodically assess whether

representative payee and who would better serve the best interests
of the child. If the agency which provides child welfare services
-

– 5 –
determines that such a person exists, the agency which provides
child welfare services shall consult with the child, any parent
whose rights have not been terminated and the attorney for the
child about the person identified. If after such consultation, the
agency continues to believe that the person is suitable to assume
the role of representative payee, the agency shall contact the
person to support him or her in applying to be the representative
payee for the child.
10. If a person assumes the role of representative payee
pursuant to subsection 3 or 9 for a child who is in the custody of

require the representative payee to:

ceases to serve as the representative payee for a child shall remit
any balance remaining in an account established pursuant to
subsection 4 or transfer control over such an account in
accordance with the requirements prescribed by the source of the
money or, in the absence of such requirements, to:
(a) The new representative payee for the child, if any;
(b) The parent or legal guardian of the child, if there is no new
