AN ACT relating to firearms; establishing provisions for voluntarily
placing temporary restrictions on the possession, custody,
control, purchase or acquisition of firearms; revising
provisions relating to permits to carry a concealed firearm

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes a family or household member who reasonably
2 believes, or a law enforcement officer who has probable cause to believe, that a
3 person poses an imminent risk of causing personal injury to himself or herself or
4 another person by possessing, controlling, purchasing or otherwise acquiring a
5 firearm, to file a verified application for an emergency or extended order for
6 protection against high-risk behavior. (NRS 33.560) Existing law also prohibits
7 certain persons from owning or having in their possession or under their custody or
8 control any firearm under certain circumstances. (NRS 202.360) Sections 2-14 of
9 this bill establish a process wherein a person may voluntarily seek to temporarily
10 restrict his or her ability to possess, have custody or control of or purchase or
11 otherwise acquire any firearm.
12 Section 8 of this bill requires the Department of Public Safety to: (1) develop a
13 process and forms for inclusion on, and removal from, a list of temporary restricted
14 persons; and (2) maintain the list. Section 9 of this bill requires: (1) a licensed
-

– 2 –
15 firearm dealer or local law enforcement agency to accept such forms from persons
16 requesting inclusion on the list of temporary restricted persons and transmit the
17 forms to the Central Repository for Nevada Records of Criminal History through
18 the Nevada Criminal Justice Information System; and (2) the Central Repository to
19 add such persons to the list of temporary restricted persons and enter the
20 information in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. Section
21 11 of this bill provides a similar process for requesting removal from the list of
22 temporary restricted persons. Section 12 of this bill requires a licensed firearm
23 dealer or local law enforcement agency, as applicable, to destroy the files and the
24 Central Repository to destroy the records after a person is removed from the list of
25 temporary restricted persons.
26 Under existing law, a person who wishes to carry a concealed firearm is
27 required to obtain a permit from the sheriff and certain persons are prohibited from
28 obtaining such a permit. (NRS 202.3657) Section 15 of this bill requires the sheriff
29 to deny an application for or suspend a permit to carry a concealed firearm if a
30 person is temporarily restricted from possessing, having custody or control of or
31 purchasing or otherwise acquiring any firearm.
32 Section 13 of this bill provides that all forms and records relating to temporary
33 restrictions under sections 2-14 are confidential and are not public records. Section
34 16 of this bill makes a conforming change to indicate that such information is
35 exempt from the requirement that public books and public records of a
36 governmental entity must be open to inspection.

1 may be prepared from those public books and public records. Any
2 such copies, abstracts or memoranda may be used to supply the
3 general public with copies, abstracts or memoranda of the records or
4 may be used in any other way to the advantage of the governmental

6 any manner affect the federal laws governing copyrights or enlarge,
7 diminish or affect in any other manner the rights of a person in any
8 written book or record which is copyrighted pursuant to federal law.
9 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record
10 which is copyrighted solely because it is copyrighted.
11 3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a
12 public book or record shall not deny a request made pursuant to
13 subsection 1 to inspect or copy or receive a copy of a public book or
14 record on the basis that the requested public book or record contains
15 information that is confidential if the governmental entity can

21 public record in an electronic format by means of an electronic
22 medium. Nothing in this subsection requires a governmental entity
23 to provide a copy of a public record in an electronic format or by
24 means of an electronic medium if:
25 (a) The public record:
26 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
27 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
28 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by
29 means of an electronic medium would:
30 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
31 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential
32 and that cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from
33 information that is not otherwise confidential.
34 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who
35 has legal custody or control of a public record:
36 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the

38 already prepared or would prefer to provide the copy in a different
39 medium.
40 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon
41 request, prepare the copy of the public record and shall not require
42 the person who has requested the copy to prepare the copy himself
