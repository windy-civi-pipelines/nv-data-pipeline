EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to [firearms; establishing provisions for voluntarily placing
temporary restrictions on the possession, custody, control, purchase or
acquisition of firearms; revising provisions relating to permits to carry
a concealed firearm for persons with temporary restrictions on
firearms; providing that forms and records relating to temporary
restrictions on firearms are confidential; requiring the Department of
Public Safety to adopt regulations relating to temporary restrictions on
firearms;] civil immunity; providing immunity from civil liability to
licensed firearm dealers and local law enforcement agencies under
certain circumstances; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law [authorizes a family or household member who reasonably believes, or a law
2 enforcement officer who has probable cause to believe, that a person poses an imminent risk
3 of causing personal injury to himself or herself or another person by possessing, controlling,
4 purchasing or otherwise acquiring a firearm, to file a verified application for an emergency or
5 extended order for protection against high-risk behavior. (NRS 33.560) Existing law also
6 prohibits certain persons from owning or having in their possession or under their custody or
7 control any firearm under certain circumstances. (NRS 202.360) Sections 2-14 of this bill
8 establish a process wherein a person may voluntarily seek to temporarily restrict his or her
9 ability to possess, have custody or control of or purchase or otherwise acquire any firearm.
10 Section 8 of this bill requires the Department of Public Safety to: (1) develop a process
11 and forms for inclusion on, and removal from, a list of temporary restricted persons; and (2)
12 maintain the list. Section 9 of this bill requires: (1) a licensed firearm dealer or local law
13 enforcement agency to accept such forms from persons requesting inclusion on the list of
14 temporary restricted persons and transmit the forms to the Central Repository for Nevada
15 Records of Criminal History through the Nevada Criminal Justice Information System; and
16 (2) the Central Repository to add such persons to the list of temporary restricted persons and

Assembly Amendment No. 405 to Assembly Bill No. 451 Page 4
17 enter the information in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. Section 11
18 of this bill provides a similar process for requesting removal from the list of temporary
19 restricted persons. Section 12 of this bill requires a licensed firearm dealer or local law
20 enforcement agency, as applicable, to destroy the files and the Central Repository to destroy
21 the records after a person is removed from the list of temporary restricted persons.
22 Under existing law, a person who wishes to carry a concealed firearm is required to
23 obtain a permit from the sheriff and certain persons are prohibited from obtaining such a
24 permit. (NRS 202.3657) Section 15 of this bill requires the sheriff to deny an application for
25 or suspend a permit to carry a concealed firearm if a person is temporarily restricted from
26 possessing, having custody or control of or purchasing or otherwise acquiring any firearm.
27 Section 13 of this bill provides that all forms and records relating to temporary
28 restrictions under sections 2-14 are confidential and are not public records. Section 16 of this
29 bill makes a conforming change to indicate that such information is exempt from the
30 requirement that public books and public records of a governmental entity must be open to
31 inspection.] provides immunity from civil liability to certain persons for acts or omissions
32 under certain circumstances. (Chapter 41 of NRS) This bill extends immunity from civil
33 liability under certain circumstances to a licensed firearm dealer or local law
34 enforcement agency who returns a firearm to the owner of the firearm pursuant to a
35 firearm hold agreement, wherein the licensed firearm dealer or local law enforcement
36 agency: (1) takes physical possession of the owner’s lawfully possessed firearm at the
37 request of the owner; (2) holds the firearm for an agreed upon period of not less than 21
38 days; and (3) returns the firearm to the owner according to the terms of the agreement.
1 WHEREAS, Suicide is a public health crisis affecting countless Nevada
2 families and communities daily; and
3 WHEREAS, According to the Office of Suicide Prevention of the Division of
4 Public and Behavioral Health of the Department of Health and Human
5 Services, this State had the highest state rate of suicide from 1999-2015 for
6 people 65 years of age or older; and
7 WHEREAS, Suicide prevention for seniors, veterans, military members,
8 their families and all Nevada residents requires expanded secure, out-of-home
9 storage of firearms to reduce access to lethal means; and
10 WHEREAS, Encouraging temporary and voluntary out-of-home storage of
11 firearms is a critical step in reducing suicide risk and saving lives as has been
12 demonstrated by similar acts and programs in other states; and
13 WHEREAS, It is the intent of this act and the Legislature to facilitate efforts
14 to reduce the risk of suicide by establishing limited civil liability protections
15 for licensed firearm dealers and local law enforcement agencies who enter into
16 agreements with owners of firearms who are voluntarily seeking to securely
17 store their firearms; now, therefore,
18

28 Statutes of Nevada 2011 and section 2 of chapter 391, Statutes of Nevada 2013 and
29 unless otherwise declared by law to be confidential, all public books and public
30 records of a governmental entity must be open at all times during office hours to
31 inspection by any person, and may be fully copied or an abstract or memorandum
32 may be prepared from those public books and public records. Any such copies,
33 abstracts or memoranda may be used to supply the general public with copies,
34 abstracts or memoranda of the records or may be used in any other way to the
35 advantage of the governmental entity or of the general public. This section does not
36 supersede or in any manner affect the federal laws governing copyrights or enlarge,
37 diminish or affect in any other manner the rights of a person in any written book or
38 record which is copyrighted pursuant to federal law.
39 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record which is
40 copyrighted solely because it is copyrighted.
41 3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a public book or
42 record shall not deny a request made pursuant to subsection 1 to inspect or copy or
43 receive a copy of a public book or record on the basis that the requested public
44 book or record contains information that is confidential if the governmental entity
45 can redact, delete, conceal or separate, including, without limitation, electronically,
46 the confidential information from the information included in the public book or
47 record that is not otherwise confidential.
48 4. If requested, a governmental entity shall provide a copy of a public record
49 in an electronic format by means of an electronic medium. Nothing in this
50 subsection requires a governmental entity to provide a copy of a public record in an
51 electronic format or by means of an electronic medium if:
52 (a) The public record:
53 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and

Assembly Amendment No. 405 to Assembly Bill No. 451 Page 12
1 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
2 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by means of an
3 electronic medium would:
4 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
5 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential and that
6 cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from information that is not
7 otherwise confidential.
8 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who has legal
9 custody or control of a public record:
10 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the medium that
11 is requested because the officer, employee or agent has already prepared or would
12 prefer to provide the copy in a different medium.
13 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon request, prepare
14 the copy of the public record and shall not require the person who has requested the
15 copy to prepare the copy himself or herself.] (Deleted by amendment.)

17 2. Sections 1 to 16, inclusive, of this act become effective:
18 (a) Upon passage and approval for the purpose of adopting any regulations and
19 performing any other preparatory administrative tasks that are necessary to carry
20 out the provisions of this act; and
21 (b) On October 1, 2025, for all other purposes.] (Deleted by amendment.)
