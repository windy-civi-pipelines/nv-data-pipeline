firearm pursuant to a firearm hold agreement, wherein the licensed firearm dealer
or local law enforcement agency: (1) takes possession of the owner’s firearm at the
request of the owner; and (2) returns the firearm to the owner according to the

WHEREAS, Suicide is a public health crisis affecting countless

WHEREAS, Suicide prevention for seniors, veterans, military
members, their families and all Nevada residents requires expanded
secure, out-of-home storage of firearms to reduce access to lethal

storage of firearms is a critical step in reducing suicide risk and
saving lives as has been demonstrated by similar acts and programs
in other states; and

facilitate efforts to reduce the risk of suicide by establishing limited
civil liability protections for licensed firearm dealers and local law
enforcement agencies who enter into agreements with owners of
firearms who are voluntarily seeking to securely store their firearms;
