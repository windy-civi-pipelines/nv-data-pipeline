or identification card during certain periods; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth deadlines for registering to vote for certain elections which depend
2 on the method by which a person registers to vote. (NRS 293.560, 293C.527) Sections 1 and
3 2.5 of this bill provide that the deadline to register to vote for such elections by means of
4 automatic voter registration is the [thirteenth] eighteenth day preceding the election.
5 Existing law requires: (1) certain agencies to provide automatic voter registration
6 services; and (2) an automatic voter registration agency to transmit certain voter registration
7 information to the top-down voter registration database created by the Secretary of State for
8 the purpose of registering a person to vote or updating the voter registration information of a
9 person. (NRS 293.5768, 293.57686) Existing law further requires an automatic voter
10 registration agency to electronically transmit to the top-down voter registration database voter
11 registration information not later than 1 working day after collecting the information during
12 the 2 weeks immediately preceding the fifth Sunday preceding an election. (NRS 293.57688)
13 Section 1.3 of this bill instead requires an automatic voter registration agency to electronically
14 transmit to the database voter registration information not later than 1 working day after
15 collecting the information if the information is collected during the period: (1) beginning 2
16 weeks immediately preceding the [thirteenth] eighteenth day before an election; and (2)
17 ending on the [thirteenth] eighteenth day before an election.
18 Existing law sets forth certain deadlines for registering to vote by mail, computer or
19 appearing in person at the office of the county or city clerk. (NRS 293.560, 293C.527)
20 Existing law also authorizes an elector to register to vote after such deadlines: (1) through the
21 Thursday preceding the election, by computer using the online registration system provided
22 on the Internet website of the Office of the Secretary of State; and (2) after such online
Senate Amendment No. 758 to Senate Bill No. 422 First Reprint Page 4
23 registration, by appearing in person during the period for early voting or on election day. To
24 register to vote during such periods, an elector must provide his or her driver’s license or
25 identification card issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles and, if the license or
26 identification card does not include his or her current residential address, certain documents
27 establishing proof of residency. (NRS 293.5837-293.5847)
28 Sections 1.7 and 2 of this bill instead provide that to register to vote in person during the
29 period for early voting or on election day, an elector is required, with certain exceptions, to
30 provide a current and valid driver’s license or identification card issued by this State, another
31 state, the District of Columbia or a territory of the United States or provide a tribal
32 identification card as proof of the elector’s identity. If the elector’s driver’s license or
33 identification card was issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles and shows the elector’s
34 current residential address, the driver’s license or identification card is also proof of the
35 elector’s residency. If the elector’s tribal identification card shows the elector’s current
36 residential address, the tribal identification card is also proof of the elector’s residency.
37 Sections 1.7 and 2 provide that if the elector’s driver’s license or identification card was
38 not issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles, the elector may cast a provisional ballot if he
39 or she completes a written affirmation. Any such elector who casts a provisional ballot must
40 provide a current or valid driver’s license or identification card issued by the Department, an
41 interim document issued by the Department or a tribal identification card demonstrating proof
42 of residency by 5 p.m. on the Friday immediately following election day.
43 Sections 1.7 and 2 also provide that if an elector’s driver’s license or identification card
44 issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles does not have the elector’s current residential
45 address, the elector may present an original, electronic or certified copy of a document as
46 proof of residency and that, for certain documents, such document must be dated not more
47 than 60 days before the date the elector is registering to vote.
48 Sections 1.7 and 2 further provide that if an elector does not have a driver’s license or
49 identification card issued by this State, another state, the District of Columbia or any territory
50 of the United States or a tribal identification card, the elector may cast a provisional ballot if
51 he or she completes a written affirmation. Any such elector who casts a provisional ballot
52 must provide a current and valid driver’s license, identification card or interim document
53 issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles or a tribal identification card demonstrating proof
54 of identity and residency in this State by 5 p.m. on the Friday immediately following election
55 day.
56 Existing law authorizes the Director of the Department of Motor Vehicles to arrange for
57 extended hours of operation for offices of the Department in a county whose population is
58 100,000 or more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties). (NRS 481.057) Section 3 of this bill
59 provides that, in a county whose population is 100,000 or more, the Director is required to
60 arrange for the offices of the Department to remain open on Saturdays and Sundays and at
61 hours other than 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. for a person to only apply for the issuance or renewal of any
62 type of driver’s license or identification card issued by the Department: (1) during the 2 weeks
63 immediately preceding the last day to register to vote by mail for a primary election,
64 presidential preference primary election or general election; and (2) during the 6 calendar days
65 immediately following the day of a primary election, presidential preference primary election
66 or general election. Section 3 further prohibits the Department from requiring, in a county
67 whose population is 100,000 or more, a person to have an appointment to apply for the
68 issuance or renewal of any type of driver’s license or identification card issued by the
69 Department: (1) during the 2 weeks immediately preceding the last day to register to vote by

~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to elections; revising provisions relating to certain deadlines
relating to automatic voter registration; revising provisions relating to
voter registration during certain periods preceding an election;
requiring the Department of Motor Vehicles to have extended hours of
operation in certain counties during certain periods preceding the
deadline to register to vote by mail for certain elections and following
the day of certain elections; prohibiting, in certain counties, the
Department from requiring an appointment to obtain a driver’s license
or identification card during certain periods; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth deadlines for registering to vote for certain elections which depend
2 on the method by which a person registers to vote. (NRS 293.560, 293C.527) Sections 1 and
3 2.5 of this bill provide that the deadline to register to vote for such elections by means of
4 automatic voter registration is the [thirteenth] eighteenth day preceding the election.
5 Existing law requires: (1) certain agencies to provide automatic voter registration
6 services; and (2) an automatic voter registration agency to transmit certain voter registration
7 information to the top-down voter registration database created by the Secretary of State for
8 the purpose of registering a person to vote or updating the voter registration information of a
9 person. (NRS 293.5768, 293.57686) Existing law further requires an automatic voter
10 registration agency to electronically transmit to the top-down voter registration database voter
11 registration information not later than 1 working day after collecting the information during
12 the 2 weeks immediately preceding the fifth Sunday preceding an election. (NRS 293.57688)
13 Section 1.3 of this bill instead requires an automatic voter registration agency to electronically
14 transmit to the database voter registration information not later than 1 working day after
15 collecting the information if the information is collected during the period: (1) beginning 2
16 weeks immediately preceding the [thirteenth] eighteenth day before an election; and (2)
17 ending on the [thirteenth] eighteenth day before an election.
18 Existing law sets forth certain deadlines for registering to vote by mail, computer or
19 appearing in person at the office of the county or city clerk. (NRS 293.560, 293C.527)
20 Existing law also authorizes an elector to register to vote after such deadlines: (1) through the
21 Thursday preceding the election, by computer using the online registration system provided
22 on the Internet website of the Office of the Secretary of State; and (2) after such online

Senate Amendment No. 758 to Senate Bill No. 422 First Reprint Page 4
23 registration, by appearing in person during the period for early voting or on election day. To
24 register to vote during such periods, an elector must provide his or her driver’s license or
25 identification card issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles and, if the license or
26 identification card does not include his or her current residential address, certain documents
27 establishing proof of residency. (NRS 293.5837-293.5847)
28 Sections 1.7 and 2 of this bill instead provide that to register to vote in person during the
29 period for early voting or on election day, an elector is required, with certain exceptions, to
30 provide a current and valid driver’s license or identification card issued by this State, another
31 state, the District of Columbia or a territory of the United States or provide a tribal
32 identification card as proof of the elector’s identity. If the elector’s driver’s license or
33 identification card was issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles and shows the elector’s
34 current residential address, the driver’s license or identification card is also proof of the
35 elector’s residency. If the elector’s tribal identification card shows the elector’s current
36 residential address, the tribal identification card is also proof of the elector’s residency.
37 Sections 1.7 and 2 provide that if the elector’s driver’s license or identification card was
38 not issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles, the elector may cast a provisional ballot if he
39 or she completes a written affirmation. Any such elector who casts a provisional ballot must
40 provide a current or valid driver’s license or identification card issued by the Department, an
41 interim document issued by the Department or a tribal identification card demonstrating proof
42 of residency by 5 p.m. on the Friday immediately following election day.
43 Sections 1.7 and 2 also provide that if an elector’s driver’s license or identification card
44 issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles does not have the elector’s current residential
45 address, the elector may present an original, electronic or certified copy of a document as
46 proof of residency and that, for certain documents, such document must be dated not more
47 than 60 days before the date the elector is registering to vote.
48 Sections 1.7 and 2 further provide that if an elector does not have a driver’s license or
49 identification card issued by this State, another state, the District of Columbia or any territory
50 of the United States or a tribal identification card, the elector may cast a provisional ballot if
51 he or she completes a written affirmation. Any such elector who casts a provisional ballot
52 must provide a current and valid driver’s license, identification card or interim document
53 issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles or a tribal identification card demonstrating proof
54 of identity and residency in this State by 5 p.m. on the Friday immediately following election
55 day.
56 Existing law authorizes the Director of the Department of Motor Vehicles to arrange for
57 extended hours of operation for offices of the Department in a county whose population is
58 100,000 or more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties). (NRS 481.057) Section 3 of this bill
59 provides that, in a county whose population is 100,000 or more, the Director is required to
60 arrange for the offices of the Department to remain open on Saturdays and Sundays and at
61 hours other than 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. for a person to only apply for the issuance or renewal of any
62 type of driver’s license or identification card issued by the Department: (1) during the 2 weeks
63 immediately preceding the last day to register to vote by mail for a primary election,
64 presidential preference primary election or general election; and (2) during the 6 calendar days
65 immediately following the day of a primary election, presidential preference primary election
66 or general election. Section 3 further prohibits the Department from requiring, in a county
67 whose population is 100,000 or more, a person to have an appointment to apply for the
68 issuance or renewal of any type of driver’s license or identification card issued by the
69 Department: (1) during the 2 weeks immediately preceding the last day to register to vote by
70 mail for a primary election, presidential preference primary election or general election; and
71 (2) during the 6 calendar days immediately following the day of a primary election,
72 presidential preference primary election or general election.
