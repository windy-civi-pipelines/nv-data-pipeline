and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law sets forth deadlines for registering to vote for certain elections
which depend on the method by which a person registers to vote. (NRS 293.560,
293C.527) Sections 1 and 2.5 of this bill provide that the deadline to register to
vote for such elections by means of automatic voter registration is the eighteenth
day preceding the election.
Existing law requires: (1) certain agencies to provide automatic voter
registration services; and (2) an automatic voter registration agency to transmit
certain voter registration information to the top-down voter registration database
created by the Secretary of State for the purpose of registering a person to vote or
updating the voter registration information of a person. (NRS 293.5768, 293.57686)
Existing law further requires an automatic voter registration agency to
electronically transmit to the top-down voter registration database voter registration
information not later than 1 working day after collecting the information during the
2 weeks immediately preceding the fifth Sunday preceding an election. (NRS

Section 2:
293.57688) Section 1.3 of this bill instead requires an automatic voter registration
agency to electronically transmit to the database voter registration information not
later than 1 working day after collecting the information if the information is
collected during the period: (1) beginning 2 weeks immediately preceding the
eighteenth day before an election; and (2) ending on the eighteenth day before an
election.
Existing law sets forth certain deadlines for registering to vote by mail,
computer or appearing in person at the office of the county or city clerk. (NRS

Section 3:
293.560, 293C.527) Existing law also authorizes an elector to register to vote after
such deadlines: (1) through the Thursday preceding the election, by computer using
the online registration system provided on the Internet website of the Office of the
Secretary of State; and (2) after such online registration, by appearing in person
during the period for early voting or on election day. To register to vote during such
periods, an elector must provide his or her driver’s license or identification card
issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles and, if the license or identification
card does not include his or her current residential address, certain documents
establishing proof of residency. (NRS 293.5837-293.5847)

Section 4:
Sections 1.7 and 2 of this bill instead provide that to register to vote in person
during the period for early voting or on election day, an elector is required, with
certain exceptions, to provide a current and valid driver’s license or identification
-

United States or provide a tribal identification card as proof of the elector’s
identity. If the elector’s driver’s license or identification card was issued by the
Department of Motor Vehicles and shows the elector’s current residential address,
the driver’s license or identification card is also proof of the elector’s residency. If
the elector’s tribal identification card shows the elector’s current residential
address, the tribal identification card is also proof of the elector’s residency.

Section 5:
Sections 1.7 and 2 provide that if the elector’s driver’s license or identification
card was not issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles, the elector may cast a
provisional ballot if he or she completes a written affirmation. Any such elector
who casts a provisional ballot must provide a current or valid driver’s license or
identification card issued by the Department, an interim document issued by the
Department or a tribal identification card demonstrating proof of residency by 5
p.m. on the Friday immediately following election day.

Section 6:
Sections 1.7 and 2 also provide that if an elector’s driver’s license or
identification card issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles does not have the
elector’s current residential address, the elector may present an original, electronic
or certified copy of a document as proof of residency and that, for certain
documents, such document must be dated not more than 60 days before the date the
elector is registering to vote.

Section 7:
Sections 1.7 and 2 further provide that if an elector does not have a driver’s
license or identification card issued by this State, another state, the District of
Columbia or any territory of the United States or a tribal identification card, the
elector may cast a provisional ballot if he or she completes a written affirmation.
Any such elector who casts a provisional ballot must provide a current and valid
driver’s license, identification card or interim document issued by the Department
of Motor Vehicles or a tribal identification card demonstrating proof of identity and
residency in this State by 5 p.m. on the Friday immediately following election day.
Existing law authorizes the Director of the Department of Motor Vehicles to
arrange for extended hours of operation for offices of the Department in a county
whose population is 100,000 or more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties). (NRS

Section 8:
481.057) Section 3 of this bill provides that, in a county whose population is
100,000 or more, the Director is required to arrange for the offices of the
Department to remain open on Saturdays and Sundays and at hours other than 8
a.m. to 5 p.m. for a person to only apply for the issuance or renewal of any type of
driver’s license or identification card issued by the Department: (1) during the 2
weeks immediately preceding the last day to register to vote by mail for a primary
election, presidential preference primary election or general election; and (2) during
the 6 calendar days immediately following the day of a primary election,
presidential preference primary election or general election. Section 3 further
prohibits the Department from requiring, in a county whose population is 100,000
or more, a person to have an appointment to apply for the issuance or renewal of
any type of driver’s license or identification card issued by the Department: (1)
during the 2 weeks immediately preceding the last day to register to vote by mail
for a primary election, presidential preference primary election or general election;

Raw Text:
Senate Bill No. 422–Committee on
Legislative Operations and Elections
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to elections; revising provisions relating to certain
deadlines relating to automatic voter registration; revising
provisions relating to voter registration during certain periods
preceding an election; requiring the Department of Motor
Vehicles to have extended hours of operation in certain
counties during certain periods preceding the deadline to
register to vote by mail for certain elections and following the
day of certain elections; prohibiting, in certain counties, the
Department from requiring an appointment to obtain a
driver’s license or identification card during certain periods;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law sets forth deadlines for registering to vote for certain elections
which depend on the method by which a person registers to vote. (NRS 293.560,
293C.527) Sections 1 and 2.5 of this bill provide that the deadline to register to
vote for such elections by means of automatic voter registration is the eighteenth
day preceding the election.
Existing law requires: (1) certain agencies to provide automatic voter
registration services; and (2) an automatic voter registration agency to transmit
certain voter registration information to the top-down voter registration database
created by the Secretary of State for the purpose of registering a person to vote or
updating the voter registration information of a person. (NRS 293.5768, 293.57686)
Existing law further requires an automatic voter registration agency to
electronically transmit to the top-down voter registration database voter registration
information not later than 1 working day after collecting the information during the
2 weeks immediately preceding the fifth Sunday preceding an election. (NRS
293.57688) Section 1.3 of this bill instead requires an automatic voter registration
agency to electronically transmit to the database voter registration information not
later than 1 working day after collecting the information if the information is
collected during the period: (1) beginning 2 weeks immediately preceding the
eighteenth day before an election; and (2) ending on the eighteenth day before an
election.
Existing law sets forth certain deadlines for registering to vote by mail,
computer or appearing in person at the office of the county or city clerk. (NRS
293.560, 293C.527) Existing law also authorizes an elector to register to vote after
such deadlines: (1) through the Thursday preceding the election, by computer using
the online registration system provided on the Internet website of the Office of the
Secretary of State; and (2) after such online registration, by appearing in person
during the period for early voting or on election day. To register to vote during such
periods, an elector must provide his or her driver’s license or identification card
issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles and, if the license or identification
card does not include his or her current residential address, certain documents
establishing proof of residency. (NRS 293.5837-293.5847)
Sections 1.7 and 2 of this bill instead provide that to register to vote in person
during the period for early voting or on election day, an elector is required, with
certain exceptions, to provide a current and valid driver’s license or identification
-

– 2 –
card issued by this State, another state, the District of Columbia or a territory of the
United States or provide a tribal identification card as proof of the elector’s
identity. If the elector’s driver’s license or identification card was issued by the
Department of Motor Vehicles and shows the elector’s current residential address,
the driver’s license or identification card is also proof of the elector’s residency. If
the elector’s tribal identification card shows the elector’s current residential
address, the tribal identification card is also proof of the elector’s residency.
Sections 1.7 and 2 provide that if the elector’s driver’s license or identification
card was not issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles, the elector may cast a
provisional ballot if he or she completes a written affirmation. Any such elector
who casts a provisional ballot must provide a current or valid driver’s license or
identification card issued by the Department, an interim document issued by the
Department or a tribal identification card demonstrating proof of residency by 5
p.m. on the Friday immediately following election day.
Sections 1.7 and 2 also provide that if an elector’s driver’s license or
identification card issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles does not have the
elector’s current residential address, the elector may present an original, electronic
or certified copy of a document as proof of residency and that, for certain
documents, such document must be dated not more than 60 days before the date the
elector is registering to vote.
Sections 1.7 and 2 further provide that if an elector does not have a driver’s
license or identification card issued by this State, another state, the District of
Columbia or any territory of the United States or a tribal identification card, the
elector may cast a provisional ballot if he or she completes a written affirmation.
Any such elector who casts a provisional ballot must provide a current and valid
driver’s license, identification card or interim document issued by the Department
of Motor Vehicles or a tribal identification card demonstrating proof of identity and
residency in this State by 5 p.m. on the Friday immediately following election day.
Existing law authorizes the Director of the Department of Motor Vehicles to
arrange for extended hours of operation for offices of the Department in a county
whose population is 100,000 or more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties). (NRS
481.057) Section 3 of this bill provides that, in a county whose population is
100,000 or more, the Director is required to arrange for the offices of the
Department to remain open on Saturdays and Sundays and at hours other than 8
a.m. to 5 p.m. for a person to only apply for the issuance or renewal of any type of
driver’s license or identification card issued by the Department: (1) during the 2
weeks immediately preceding the last day to register to vote by mail for a primary
election, presidential preference primary election or general election; and (2) during
the 6 calendar days immediately following the day of a primary election,
presidential preference primary election or general election. Section 3 further
prohibits the Department from requiring, in a county whose population is 100,000
or more, a person to have an appointment to apply for the issuance or renewal of
any type of driver’s license or identification card issued by the Department: (1)
during the 2 weeks immediately preceding the last day to register to vote by mail
for a primary election, presidential preference primary election or general election;
and (2) during the 6 calendar days immediately following the day of a primary
election, presidential preference primary election or general election.
