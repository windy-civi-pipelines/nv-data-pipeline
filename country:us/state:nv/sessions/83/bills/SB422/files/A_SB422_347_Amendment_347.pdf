or identification card during certain periods; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth deadlines for registering to vote for certain elections which
2 depend on the method by which a person registers to vote. (NRS 293.560, 293C.527)
3 Sections 1 and 2.5 of this bill provide that the deadline to register to vote for such
4 elections by means of automatic voter registration is the thirteenth day preceding the
5 election.
6 Existing law requires: (1) certain agencies to provide automatic voter registration
7 services; and (2) an automatic voter registration agency to transmit certain voter
8 registration information to the top-down voter registration database created by the
9 Secretary of State for the purpose of registering a person to vote or updating the voter
10 registration information of a person. (NRS 293.5768, 293.57686) Existing law further
11 requires an automatic voter registration agency to electronically transmit to the top-
12 down voter registration database voter registration information not later than 1 working
13 day after collecting the information during the 2 weeks immediately preceding the fifth
14 Sunday preceding an election. (NRS 293.57688) Section 1.3 of this bill instead requires
15 an automatic voter registration agency to electronically transmit to the database voter
16 registration information not later than 1 working day after collecting the information if
17 the information is collected during the period: (1) beginning 2 weeks immediately
18 preceding the thirteenth day before an election; and (2) ending on the thirteenth day
19 before an election.
20 Existing law sets forth certain deadlines for registering to vote by mail, computer or
21 appearing in person at the office of the county or city clerk. (NRS 293.560, 293C.527)
22 Existing law also authorizes an elector to register to vote after such deadlines: (1) through the

Senate Amendment No. 347 to Senate Bill No. 422 Page 4
23 Thursday preceding the election, by computer using the online registration system provided
24 on the Internet website of the Office of the Secretary of State; and (2) after such online
25 registration, by appearing in person during the period for early voting or on election day. To
26 register to vote during such periods, an elector must provide his or her driver’s license or
27 identification card issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles and, if the license or
28 identification card does not include his or her current residential address, certain documents
29 establishing proof of residency. (NRS 293.5837-293.5847)
30 Sections [1] 1.7 and 2 of this bill instead provide that to register to vote in person during
31 the period for early voting or on election day, an elector is required, with certain exceptions,
32 to provide a current and valid driver’s license or identification card issued by this State,
33 another state, the District of Columbia or a territory of the United States or provide a tribal
34 identification card as proof of the elector’s identity. If the elector’s driver’s license or
35 identification card was issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles and shows the elector’s
36 current residential address, the driver’s license or identification card is also proof of the
37 elector’s residency. If the elector’s tribal identification card shows the elector’s current
38 residential address, the tribal identification card is also proof of the elector’s residency.
39 Sections [1] 1.7 and 2 provide that if the elector’s driver’s license or identification card
40 was not issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles, the elector may cast a provisional ballot
41 if he or she completes a written affirmation. Any such elector who casts a provisional ballot
42 must provide a current or valid driver’s license or identification card issued by the
43 Department, an interim document issued by the Department or a tribal identification card
44 demonstrating proof of residency by 5 p.m. on the Friday immediately following election day.
45 Sections [1] 1.7 and 2 also provide that if an elector’s driver’s license or identification
46 card issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles does not have the elector’s current
47 residential address, the elector may present an original, electronic or certified copy of a
48 document as proof of residency and that, for certain documents, such document must be dated
49 not more than 60 days before the date the elector is registering to vote.
50 Sections [1] 1.7 and 2 further provide that if an elector does not have a driver’s license or
51 identification card issued by this State, another state, the District of Columbia or any territory
52 of the United States or a tribal identification card, the elector may cast a provisional ballot if
53 he or she completes a written affirmation. Any such elector who casts a provisional ballot
54 must provide a current and valid driver’s license, identification card or interim document
55 issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles or a tribal identification card demonstrating proof
56 of identity and residency in this State by 5 p.m. on the Friday immediately following election
57 day.
58 Existing law authorizes the Director of the Department of Motor Vehicles to arrange for
59 extended hours of operation for offices of the Department in a county whose population is
60 100,000 or more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties). (NRS 481.057) Section 3 of this bill
61 provides that, in a county whose population is 100,000 or more, the Director is required to
62 arrange for the offices of the Department to remain open on Saturdays and Sundays and at
63 hours other than 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. for a person to only apply for the issuance or renewal of any
64 type of driver’s license or identification card issued by the Department: (1) during the 2 weeks
65 immediately preceding the last day to register to vote by mail for a primary election,
66 presidential preference primary election or general election; and (2) during the 6 calendar days
67 immediately following the day of a primary election, presidential preference primary election
68 or general election. Section 3 further prohibits the Department from requiring, in a county
69 whose population is 100,000 or more, a person to have an appointment to apply for the
70 issuance or renewal of any type of driver’s license or identification card issued by the
71 Department: (1) during the 2 weeks immediately preceding the last day to register to vote by
