AN ACT relating to elections; revising provisions relating to certain

provisions relating to voter registration during certain
periods preceding an election; requiring the Department
of Motor Vehicles to have extended hours of operation in

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth deadlines for registering to vote for certain elections
2 which depend on the method by which a person registers to vote. (NRS 293.560,
3 293C.527) Sections 1 and 2.5 of this bill provide that the deadline to register to
4 vote for such elections by means of automatic voter registration is the eighteenth
5 day preceding the election.
6 Existing law requires: (1) certain agencies to provide automatic voter
7 registration services; and (2) an automatic voter registration agency to transmit
8 certain voter registration information to the top-down voter registration database
9 created by the Secretary of State for the purpose of registering a person to vote or
10 updating the voter registration information of a person. (NRS 293.5768, 293.57686)
11 Existing law further requires an automatic voter registration agency to
12 electronically transmit to the top-down voter registration database voter registration
13 information not later than 1 working day after collecting the information during the
14 2 weeks immediately preceding the fifth Sunday preceding an election. (NRS
15 293.57688) Section 1.3 of this bill instead requires an automatic voter registration
16 agency to electronically transmit to the database voter registration information not

17 later than 1 working day after collecting the information if the information is
18 collected during the period: (1) beginning 2 weeks immediately preceding the
19 eighteenth day before an election; and (2) ending on the eighteenth day before an
20 election.
21 Existing law sets forth certain deadlines for registering to vote by mail,
22 computer or appearing in person at the office of the county or city clerk. (NRS
23 293.560, 293C.527) Existing law also authorizes an elector to register to vote after
24 such deadlines: (1) through the Thursday preceding the election, by computer using
25 the online registration system provided on the Internet website of the Office of the
26 Secretary of State; and (2) after such online registration, by appearing in person
27 during the period for early voting or on election day. To register to vote during such
28 periods, an elector must provide his or her driver’s license or identification card
29 issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles and, if the license or identification
30 card does not include his or her current residential address, certain documents
31 establishing proof of residency. (NRS 293.5837-293.5847)
32 Sections 1.7 and 2 of this bill instead provide that to register to vote in person
33 during the period for early voting or on election day, an elector is required, with
34 certain exceptions, to provide a current and valid driver’s license or identification
35 card issued by this State, another state, the District of Columbia or a territory of the
36 United States or provide a tribal identification card as proof of the elector’s
37 identity. If the elector’s driver’s license or identification card was issued by the
38 Department of Motor Vehicles and shows the elector’s current residential address,
39 the driver’s license or identification card is also proof of the elector’s residency. If
40 the elector’s tribal identification card shows the elector’s current residential
41 address, the tribal identification card is also proof of the elector’s residency.
42 Sections 1.7 and 2 provide that if the elector’s driver’s license or identification
43 card was not issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles, the elector may cast a
44 provisional ballot if he or she completes a written affirmation. Any such elector
45 who casts a provisional ballot must provide a current or valid driver’s license or
46 identification card issued by the Department, an interim document issued by the
47 Department or a tribal identification card demonstrating proof of residency by 5
48 p.m. on the Friday immediately following election day.
49 Sections 1.7 and 2 also provide that if an elector’s driver’s license or
50 identification card issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles does not have the
51 elector’s current residential address, the elector may present an original, electronic
52 or certified copy of a document as proof of residency and that, for certain
53 documents, such document must be dated not more than 60 days before the date the
54 elector is registering to vote.
55 Sections 1.7 and 2 further provide that if an elector does not have a driver’s
56 license or identification card issued by this State, another state, the District of
57 Columbia or any territory of the United States or a tribal identification card, the
58 elector may cast a provisional ballot if he or she completes a written affirmation.
59 Any such elector who casts a provisional ballot must provide a current and valid
60 driver’s license, identification card or interim document issued by the Department
61 of Motor Vehicles or a tribal identification card demonstrating proof of identity and
62 residency in this State by 5 p.m. on the Friday immediately following election day.
63 Existing law authorizes the Director of the Department of Motor Vehicles to
64 arrange for extended hours of operation for offices of the Department in a county
65 whose population is 100,000 or more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties). (NRS
66 481.057) Section 3 of this bill provides that, in a county whose population is
67 100,000 or more, the Director is required to arrange for the offices of the
68 Department to remain open on Saturdays and Sundays and at hours other than 8
69 a.m. to 5 p.m. for a person to only apply for the issuance or renewal of any type of
70 driver’s license or identification card issued by the Department: (1) during the 2
71 weeks immediately preceding the last day to register to vote by mail for a primary

72 election, presidential preference primary election or general election; and (2) during
73 the 6 calendar days immediately following the day of a primary election,
74 presidential preference primary election or general election. Section 3 further
75 prohibits the Department from requiring, in a county whose population is 100,000
76 or more, a person to have an appointment to apply for the issuance or renewal of
77 any type of driver’s license or identification card issued by the Department: (1)
78 during the 2 weeks immediately preceding the last day to register to vote by mail
79 for a primary election, presidential preference primary election or general election;
80 and (2) during the 6 calendar days immediately following the day of a primary

SECOND REPRINT S.B. 422
SENATE BILL NO. 422–COMMITTEE ON
LEGISLATIVE OPERATIONS AND ELECTIONS
MARCH 24, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Legislative Operations and Elections
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to voting. (BDR 24-954)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to elections; revising provisions relating to certain
deadlines relating to automatic voter registration; revising
provisions relating to voter registration during certain
periods preceding an election; requiring the Department
of Motor Vehicles to have extended hours of operation in
certain counties during certain periods preceding the
deadline to register to vote by mail for certain elections
and following the day of certain elections; prohibiting, in
certain counties, the Department from requiring an
appointment to obtain a driver’s license or identification
card during certain periods; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth deadlines for registering to vote for certain elections
2 which depend on the method by which a person registers to vote. (NRS 293.560,
3 293C.527) Sections 1 and 2.5 of this bill provide that the deadline to register to
4 vote for such elections by means of automatic voter registration is the eighteenth
5 day preceding the election.
6 Existing law requires: (1) certain agencies to provide automatic voter
7 registration services; and (2) an automatic voter registration agency to transmit
8 certain voter registration information to the top-down voter registration database
9 created by the Secretary of State for the purpose of registering a person to vote or
10 updating the voter registration information of a person. (NRS 293.5768, 293.57686)
11 Existing law further requires an automatic voter registration agency to
12 electronically transmit to the top-down voter registration database voter registration
13 information not later than 1 working day after collecting the information during the
14 2 weeks immediately preceding the fifth Sunday preceding an election. (NRS
15 293.57688) Section 1.3 of this bill instead requires an automatic voter registration
16 agency to electronically transmit to the database voter registration information not
-
*SB422_R2*

– 2 –
17 later than 1 working day after collecting the information if the information is
18 collected during the period: (1) beginning 2 weeks immediately preceding the
19 eighteenth day before an election; and (2) ending on the eighteenth day before an
20 election.
21 Existing law sets forth certain deadlines for registering to vote by mail,
22 computer or appearing in person at the office of the county or city clerk. (NRS
23 293.560, 293C.527) Existing law also authorizes an elector to register to vote after
24 such deadlines: (1) through the Thursday preceding the election, by computer using
25 the online registration system provided on the Internet website of the Office of the
26 Secretary of State; and (2) after such online registration, by appearing in person
27 during the period for early voting or on election day. To register to vote during such
28 periods, an elector must provide his or her driver’s license or identification card
29 issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles and, if the license or identification
30 card does not include his or her current residential address, certain documents
31 establishing proof of residency. (NRS 293.5837-293.5847)
32 Sections 1.7 and 2 of this bill instead provide that to register to vote in person
33 during the period for early voting or on election day, an elector is required, with
34 certain exceptions, to provide a current and valid driver’s license or identification
35 card issued by this State, another state, the District of Columbia or a territory of the
36 United States or provide a tribal identification card as proof of the elector’s
37 identity. If the elector’s driver’s license or identification card was issued by the
38 Department of Motor Vehicles and shows the elector’s current residential address,
39 the driver’s license or identification card is also proof of the elector’s residency. If
40 the elector’s tribal identification card shows the elector’s current residential
41 address, the tribal identification card is also proof of the elector’s residency.
42 Sections 1.7 and 2 provide that if the elector’s driver’s license or identification
43 card was not issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles, the elector may cast a
44 provisional ballot if he or she completes a written affirmation. Any such elector
45 who casts a provisional ballot must provide a current or valid driver’s license or
46 identification card issued by the Department, an interim document issued by the
47 Department or a tribal identification card demonstrating proof of residency by 5
48 p.m. on the Friday immediately following election day.
49 Sections 1.7 and 2 also provide that if an elector’s driver’s license or
50 identification card issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles does not have the
51 elector’s current residential address, the elector may present an original, electronic
52 or certified copy of a document as proof of residency and that, for certain
53 documents, such document must be dated not more than 60 days before the date the
54 elector is registering to vote.
55 Sections 1.7 and 2 further provide that if an elector does not have a driver’s
56 license or identification card issued by this State, another state, the District of
57 Columbia or any territory of the United States or a tribal identification card, the
58 elector may cast a provisional ballot if he or she completes a written affirmation.
59 Any such elector who casts a provisional ballot must provide a current and valid
60 driver’s license, identification card or interim document issued by the Department
61 of Motor Vehicles or a tribal identification card demonstrating proof of identity and
62 residency in this State by 5 p.m. on the Friday immediately following election day.
63 Existing law authorizes the Director of the Department of Motor Vehicles to
64 arrange for extended hours of operation for offices of the Department in a county
65 whose population is 100,000 or more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties). (NRS
66 481.057) Section 3 of this bill provides that, in a county whose population is
67 100,000 or more, the Director is required to arrange for the offices of the
68 Department to remain open on Saturdays and Sundays and at hours other than 8
69 a.m. to 5 p.m. for a person to only apply for the issuance or renewal of any type of
70 driver’s license or identification card issued by the Department: (1) during the 2
71 weeks immediately preceding the last day to register to vote by mail for a primary
-
*SB422_R2*

– 3 –
72 election, presidential preference primary election or general election; and (2) during
73 the 6 calendar days immediately following the day of a primary election,
74 presidential preference primary election or general election. Section 3 further
75 prohibits the Department from requiring, in a county whose population is 100,000
76 or more, a person to have an appointment to apply for the issuance or renewal of
77 any type of driver’s license or identification card issued by the Department: (1)
78 during the 2 weeks immediately preceding the last day to register to vote by mail
79 for a primary election, presidential preference primary election or general election;
80 and (2) during the 6 calendar days immediately following the day of a primary
81 election, presidential preference primary election or general election.
