FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to elections; revising provisions relating to voter
registration during certain periods preceding an election;
requiring the Department of Motor Vehicles to have
extended hours of operation in certain counties during
certain periods preceding the deadline to register to vote
by mail for certain elections and following the day of
certain elections; prohibiting, in certain counties, the
Department from requiring an appointment to obtain a
driver’s license or identification card during certain
periods; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth certain deadlines for registering to vote by mail,
2 computer or appearing in person at the office of the county or city clerk. (NRS
3 293.560, 293C.527) Existing law also authorizes an elector to register to vote after
4 such deadlines: (1) through the Thursday preceding the election, by computer using
5 the online registration system provided on the Internet website of the Office of the
6 Secretary of State; and (2) after such online registration, by appearing in person
7 during the period for early voting or on election day. To register to vote during such
8 periods, an elector must provide his or her driver’s license or identification card
9 issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles and, if the license or identification
10 card does not include his or her current residential address, certain documents
11 establishing proof of residency. (NRS 293.5837-293.5847)
12 Sections 1 and 2 of this bill instead provide that to register to vote in person
13 during the period for early voting or on election day, an elector is required, with
14 certain exceptions, to provide a current and valid driver’s license or identification
15 card issued by this State, another state, the District of Columbia or a territory of the
16 United States or provide a tribal identification card as proof of the elector’s
17 identity. If the elector’s driver’s license or identification card was issued by the
-

– 2 –
18 Department of Motor Vehicles and shows the elector’s current residential address,
19 the driver’s license or identification card is also proof of the elector’s residency. If
20 the elector’s tribal identification card shows the elector’s current residential
21 address, the tribal identification card is also proof of the elector’s residency.
22 Sections 1 and 2 provide that if the elector’s driver’s license or identification
23 card was not issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles, the elector may cast a
24 provisional ballot if he or she completes a written affirmation. Any such elector
25 who casts a provisional ballot must provide a current or valid driver’s license or
26 identification card issued by the Department, an interim document issued by the
27 Department or a tribal identification card demonstrating proof of residency by 5
28 p.m. on the Friday immediately following election day.
29 Sections 1 and 2 also provide that if an elector’s driver’s license or
30 identification card issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles does not have the
31 elector’s current residential address, the elector may present an original, electronic
32 or certified copy of a document as proof of residency and that, for certain
33 documents, such document must be dated not more than 60 days before the date the
34 elector is registering to vote.
35 Sections 1 and 2 further provide that if an elector does not have a driver’s
36 license or identification card issued by this State, another state, the District of
37 Columbia or any territory of the United States or a tribal identification card, the
38 elector may cast a provisional ballot if he or she completes a written affirmation.
39 Any such elector who casts a provisional ballot must provide a current and valid
40 driver’s license, identification card or interim document issued by the Department
41 of Motor Vehicles or a tribal identification card demonstrating proof of identity and
42 residency in this State by 5 p.m. on the Friday immediately following election day.
43 Existing law authorizes the Director of the Department of Motor Vehicles to
44 arrange for extended hours of operation for offices of the Department in a county
45 whose population is 100,000 or more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties). (NRS
46 481.057) Section 3 of this bill provides that, in a county whose population is
47 100,000 or more, the Director is required to arrange for the offices of the
48 Department to remain open on Saturdays and Sundays and at hours other than 8
49 a.m. to 5 p.m. for a person to only apply for the issuance or renewal of any type of
50 driver’s license or identification card issued by the Department: (1) during the 2
51 weeks immediately preceding the last day to register to vote by mail for a primary
52 election, presidential preference primary election or general election; and (2) during
53 the 6 calendar days immediately following the day of a primary election,
54 presidential preference primary election or general election. Section 3 further
55 prohibits the Department from requiring, in a county whose population is 100,000
56 or more, a person to have an appointment to apply for the issuance or renewal of
57 any type of driver’s license or identification card issued by the Department: (1)
58 during the 2 weeks immediately preceding the last day to register to vote by mail
59 for a primary election, presidential preference primary election or general election;
60 and (2) during the 6 calendar days immediately following the day of a primary
61 election, presidential preference primary election or general election.

S.B. 422
SENATE BILL NO. 422–COMMITTEE ON
LEGISLATIVE OPERATIONS AND ELECTIONS
MARCH 24, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Legislative Operations and Elections
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to voting. (BDR 24-954)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to elections; revising provisions relating to voter
registration during certain periods preceding an election;
requiring the Department of Motor Vehicles to have
extended hours of operation in certain counties during
certain periods preceding the deadline to register to vote
by mail for certain elections and following the day of
certain elections; prohibiting, in certain counties, the
Department from requiring an appointment to obtain a
driver’s license or identification card during certain
periods; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth certain deadlines for registering to vote by mail,
2 computer or appearing in person at the office of the county or city clerk. (NRS
3 293.560, 293C.527) Existing law also authorizes an elector to register to vote after
4 such deadlines: (1) through the Thursday preceding the election, by computer using
5 the online registration system provided on the Internet website of the Office of the
6 Secretary of State; and (2) after such online registration, by appearing in person
7 during the period for early voting or on election day. To register to vote during such
8 periods, an elector must provide his or her driver’s license or identification card
9 issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles and, if the license or identification
10 card does not include his or her current residential address, certain documents
11 establishing proof of residency. (NRS 293.5837-293.5847)
12 Sections 1 and 2 of this bill instead provide that to register to vote in person
13 during the period for early voting or on election day, an elector is required, with
14 certain exceptions, to provide a current and valid driver’s license or identification
15 card issued by this State, another state, the District of Columbia or a territory of the
16 United States or provide a tribal identification card as proof of the elector’s
17 identity. If the elector’s driver’s license or identification card was issued by the
-
*SB422*

– 2 –
18 Department of Motor Vehicles and shows the elector’s current residential address,
19 the driver’s license or identification card is also proof of the elector’s residency. If
20 the elector’s tribal identification card shows the elector’s current residential
21 address, the tribal identification card is also proof of the elector’s residency.
22 Sections 1 and 2 provide that if the elector’s driver’s license or identification
23 card was not issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles, the elector may cast a
24 provisional ballot if he or she completes a written affirmation. Any such elector
25 who casts a provisional ballot must provide a current or valid driver’s license or
26 identification card issued by the Department, an interim document issued by the
27 Department or a tribal identification card demonstrating proof of residency by 5
28 p.m. on the Friday immediately following election day.
29 Sections 1 and 2 also provide that if an elector’s driver’s license or
