AN ACT relating to state purchasing; revising provisions relating to
certain contracts for services; revising provisions relating

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 The State Purchasing Act governs the purchasing of services, supplies,
2 materials and equipment by agencies of the Executive Department of the State
3 Government, with certain exceptions. (Chapter 333 of NRS) The Act requires that
4 certain actions be taken before entering into a contract for the purchase of
5 commodities from a sole source. (NRS 333.400) Section 1 of this bill requires the
6 Administrator of the Purchasing Division of the Department of Administration or
7 an agency subject to the Act, as applicable, to take certain actions before entering
8 into a contract for services without competitive selection. Section 1 provides a
9 procedure for filing an objection to the award of such a contract, making a decision
10 regarding the objection and appealing that decision. Section 1 also requires the
11 Administrator to submit an annual report to specified recipients regarding such
12 contracts.
13 With certain exceptions, the Act authorizes the Administrator to enter into
14 contracts for the furnishing of supplies, materials and equipment for a period of not
15 more than 2 years. Under the Act, the Administrator is authorized to annually
16 extend such contracts in certain circumstances. (NRS 333.280) Section 2 of this bill
17 expands such authority to contracts for services and provides a procedure for the
18 extension of a contract after the expiration of the period of performance stated in
19 the solicitation or advertisement for the contract and any extension authorized in
20 that solicitation or advertisement. Section 2: (1) requires the Administrator to
21 submit a report to the Legislative Commission regarding any using agency that fails
22 to comply with the procedure; and (2) requires the executive head of such a using
