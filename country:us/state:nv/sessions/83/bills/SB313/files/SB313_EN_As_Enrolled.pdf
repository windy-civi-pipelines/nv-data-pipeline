Senate Bill No. 313–Senator Daly
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to state purchasing; revising provisions relating to
certain contracts for services; revising provisions relating to
extensions of contracts for supplies, materials, equipment and
services; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
The State Purchasing Act governs the purchasing of services, supplies,
materials and equipment by agencies of the Executive Department of the State
Government, with certain exceptions. (Chapter 333 of NRS) The Act requires that
certain actions be taken before entering into a contract for the purchase of
commodities from a sole source. (NRS 333.400) Section 1 of this bill requires the
Administrator of the Purchasing Division of the Department of Administration or
an agency subject to the Act, as applicable, to take certain actions before entering
into a contract for services without competitive selection. Section 1 provides a
procedure for filing an objection to the award of such a contract, making a decision
regarding the objection and appealing that decision. Section 1 also requires the
Administrator to submit an annual report to specified recipients regarding such
contracts.
With certain exceptions, the Act authorizes the Administrator to enter into
contracts for the furnishing of supplies, materials and equipment for a period of not
more than 2 years. Under the Act, the Administrator is authorized to annually
extend such contracts in certain circumstances. (NRS 333.280) Section 2 of this bill
expands such authority to contracts for services and provides a procedure for the
extension of a contract after the expiration of the period of performance stated in
the solicitation or advertisement for the contract and any extension authorized in
that solicitation or advertisement. Section 2: (1) requires the Administrator to
submit a report to the Legislative Commission regarding any using agency that fails
to comply with the procedure; and (2) requires the executive head of such a using
agency to personally appear before the Legislative Commission to explain the
noncompliance.
