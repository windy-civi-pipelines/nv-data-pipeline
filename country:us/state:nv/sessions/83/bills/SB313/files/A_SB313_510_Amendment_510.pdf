6 of Administration or an agency subject to the Act, as applicable, to take certain actions before
7 entering into a contract for services [from a sole source.] without competitive selection.
8 Section 1 provides a procedure for filing an objection to the award of such a contract,
9 making a decision regarding the objection and appealing that decision. Section 1 also
10 requires the Administrator to submit an annual report to [the Interim Finance Committee]
11 specified recipients regarding such contracts.
12 With certain exceptions, the Act authorizes the Administrator to enter into contracts for
13 the furnishing of supplies, materials and equipment for a period of not more than 2 years.
14 Under the Act, the Administrator is authorized to annually extend such contracts in certain
15 circumstances. (NRS 333.280) Section 2 of this bill [limits such authority, with certain
16 exceptions, to not more than one extension and prescribes the term of the extension on the

22 any using agency that fails to comply with the procedure; and (2) requires the executive
23 head of such a using agency to personally appear before the Legislative Commission to
