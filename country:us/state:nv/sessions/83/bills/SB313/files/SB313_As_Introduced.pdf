3 Government, with certain exceptions. (Chapter 333 of NRS) The Act requires that
4 certain actions be taken before entering into a contract for the purchase of
5 commodities from a sole source. (NRS 333.400) Section 1 of this bill requires the
6 Administrator of the Purchasing Division of the Department of Administration or

9 to submit an annual report to the Interim Finance Committee regarding such
10 contracts.
11 With certain exceptions, the Act authorizes the Administrator to enter into
12 contracts for the furnishing of supplies, materials and equipment for a period of not
13 more than 2 years. Under the Act, the Administrator is authorized to annually
14 extend such contracts in certain circumstances. (NRS 333.280) Section 2 of this bill
15 limits such authority, with certain exceptions, to not more than one extension and
16 prescribes the term of the extension on the basis of the increase in the scope or
17 price of the extension.
