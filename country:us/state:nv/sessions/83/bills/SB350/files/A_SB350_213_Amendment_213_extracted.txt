EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to criminal procedure; extending the time for which a judgment
of death must be executed; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, when a judgment of death is pronounced, a judge is required to issue
2 a warrant that appoints the week in which the judgment is to be executed. Existing law
3 requires the appointed week to be not less than 60 days and not more than 90 days from the
4 time the judgment was pronounced. (NRS 176.345) Section 1 of this bill instead requires the
5 appointed week: (1) to be not less than 180 days nor more than 270 days from the time of
6 judgment; or (2) if there is [a] any warrant in any case appointing a week within which the
7 judgment is to be executed in force at the time a new warrant is issued, to be not less than 180
8 days nor more than 270 days from the latest date appointed for execution of the judgment.
9 Under existing law, if for any reason a judgment of death has not been executed and it
10 remains in force, the court which rendered the judgment of death may draw a new warrant.
11 Existing law requires the new warrant to appoint a week in which the judgment is to be
12 executed that is not less than 15 days nor more than 30 days after the date of the warrant.
13 (NRS 176.495) Section 2 of this bill instead requires the appointed week to be not less than
14 180 days nor more than 270 days after the date of the warrant, and in any event, not less than
15 180 days nor more than 270 days from the latest date appointed by any warrant in any case
16 for execution of the judgment.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

14 authorized person as the Director of the Department of Corrections designates, and
15 is the warrant and authority of the Director for the imprisonment and execution of
16 the prisoner, as therein provided and commanded. The Director shall return the
17 certified copy of the judgment of conviction to the county clerk of the county in
18 which it was issued. The other triplicate copy is the warrant and authority of the
19 sheriff to deliver the prisoner to the authorized person designated by the Director.
20 The final triplicate copy must be returned to the county clerk by the sheriff with the
21 sheriff’s proceedings endorsed thereon.

27 attested by the clerk under the seal of the court, and delivered to the Director of the
28 Department of Corrections.
