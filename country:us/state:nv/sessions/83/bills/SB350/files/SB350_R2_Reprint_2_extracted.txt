AN ACT relating to criminal procedure; extending the time for
which a judgment of death must be executed; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, when a judgment of death is pronounced, a judge is
2 required to issue a warrant that appoints the week in which the judgment is to be
3 executed. Existing law requires the appointed week to be not less than 60 days and
4 not more than 90 days from the time the judgment was pronounced. (NRS 176.345)
5 Section 1 of this bill instead requires the appointed week: (1) to be not less than
6 120 days nor more than 180 days from the time of judgment; or (2) if there is any
7 warrant in any case appointing a week within which the judgment is to be executed
8 in force at the time a new warrant is issued, to be not less than 120 days nor more
9 than 180 days from the latest date appointed for execution of the judgment.
10 Under existing law, if for any reason a judgment of death has not been executed
11 and it remains in force, the court which rendered the judgment of death must draw a
12 new warrant. Existing law requires the new warrant to appoint a week in which the
13 judgment is to be executed that is not less than 15 days nor more than 30 days after
14 the date of the warrant. (NRS 176.495) Section 2 of this bill instead requires the
15 appointed week to be not less than 120 days nor more than 180 days after the date
16 of the warrant, and in any event, not less than 120 days nor more than 180 days
17 from the latest date appointed by any warrant in any case for execution of the
18 judgment.
