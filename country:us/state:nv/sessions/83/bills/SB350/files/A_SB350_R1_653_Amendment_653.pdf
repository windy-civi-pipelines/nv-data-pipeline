EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to criminal procedure; extending the time for which a judgment
of death must be executed; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, when a judgment of death is pronounced, a judge is required to issue
2 a warrant that appoints the week in which the judgment is to be executed. Existing law
3 requires the appointed week to be not less than 60 days and not more than 90 days from the
4 time the judgment was pronounced. (NRS 176.345) Section 1 of this bill instead requires the
5 appointed week: (1) to be not less than [180] 120 days nor more than [270] 180 days from the
6 time of judgment; or (2) if there is any warrant in any case appointing a week within which
7 the judgment is to be executed in force at the time a new warrant is issued, to be not less than
8 [180] 120 days nor more than [270] 180 days from the latest date appointed for execution of
9 the judgment.
10 Under existing law, if for any reason a judgment of death has not been executed and it
11 remains in force, the court which rendered the judgment of death [may] must draw a new
12 warrant. Existing law requires the new warrant to appoint a week in which the judgment is to
13 be executed that is not less than 15 days nor more than 30 days after the date of the warrant.
14 (NRS 176.495) Section 2 of this bill instead requires the appointed week to be not less than
15 [180] 120 days nor more than [270] 180 days after the date of the warrant, and in any event,
16 not less than [180] 120 days nor more than [270] 180 days from the latest date appointed by
17 any warrant in any case for execution of the judgment.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

12 2. The original of the triplicate copies of the judgment of conviction and
13 warrant must be filed in the office of the county clerk, and two of the triplicate
14 copies must be immediately delivered by the clerk to the sheriff of the county. One
15 of the triplicate copies must be delivered by the sheriff, with the prisoner, to such
16 authorized person as the Director of the Department of Corrections designates, and
17 is the warrant and authority of the Director for the imprisonment and execution of
18 the prisoner, as therein provided and commanded. The Director shall return the
19 certified copy of the judgment of conviction to the county clerk of the county in
20 which it was issued. The other triplicate copy is the warrant and authority of the

29 attested by the clerk under the seal of the court, and delivered to the Director of the
30 Department of Corrections.
31 2. The warrant must state the conviction and judgment and appoint a week,

35 in any event, be not less than [180] 120 days nor more than [270] 180 days from

37 executed.
38 3. The Director shall execute a sentence of death within the week the
39 judgment is to be executed, as designated by the district court. The Director may
40 execute the judgment at any time during that week if a stay of execution is not
41 entered by a court of appropriate jurisdiction.
