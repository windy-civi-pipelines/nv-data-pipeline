AN ACT relating to public bodies; revising provisions relating to the Victim
Information Notification Everyday System in the Office of the
Attorney General; renaming the Account for Programs Related to
Domestic Violence; revising provisions governing the expenditures
authorized from the Account; renaming the Committee on Domestic
Violence; revising the membership and duties of the Committee;
transferring certain duties from the Sexual Assault Kit Working Group
to the Committee; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates in the Office of the Attorney General the Victim Information
2 Notification Everyday System, which consists of a toll-free telephone number and an
3 Internet website through which victims of crime and members of the public may register
4 to receive automated information and notification concerning changes in the custody
5 status of an offender. (NRS 228.205) Section 1 of this bill instead creates a victim
6 notification system in the Office of the Attorney General and replaces references to the
7 Victim Information Notification Everyday System with references to the newly created
8 victim notification system.
9 Existing law creates the Committee on Domestic Violence and requires the Committee to
10 carry out certain duties relating to domestic violence, including increasing awareness,
11 reviewing certain programs provided to peace officers for training related to domestic
12 violence and making recommendations regarding such training, providing financial support to
13 certain programs for the prevention of domestic violence under certain circumstances and
14 studying certain issues relating to domestic violence. (NRS 228.470) Section 4 of this bill
15 requires the Committee to also perform such duties as they relate to sexual assault.
16 Section 4 also requires the Committee to: (1) make recommendations relating to the need
17 for additional sexual assault victims’ advocates; (2) make recommendations relating to the
18 need for ongoing evaluation of the rights of survivors; and (3) review the effectiveness of the
19 statewide program to track sexual assault forensic evidence kits.
20 Section 4 further renames the Committee on Domestic Violence to the Committee on
21 Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault to reflect the expansion of the duties of the
Assembly Amendment No. 64 to Assembly Bill No. 45 Page 4
22 Committee. Sections 1, 2, 7, 8 and 10-16 of this bill make conforming changes to reflect the
23 renaming of the Committee.
24 Existing law sets forth the membership of the Committee, which consists of: (1) certain
25 persons appointed by the Attorney General, including two survivors of domestic violence; and
26 (2) one member who is a representative of the Division of Public and Behavioral Health of the
27 Department of Health and Human Services who has certain experience and is appointed by the
28 Administrator of the Division. (NRS 228.470) Section 4 revises the membership of the
29 Committee by reducing the number of survivors of domestic violence who are members of the
30 Committee from two to one and requiring the Attorney General to additionally appoint to the
31 Committee: (1) one staff member of a program for victims of sexual assault; (2) one survivor
32 of sexual assault; and (3) one medical professional with experience in working with sexual
33 assault forensic evidence kits.
34 Existing law requires the Attorney General to designate a department or division of the
35 Executive Department of State Government to establish a statewide program to track sexual
36 assault forensic evidence kits. Existing law further requires such a designation to be made
37 pursuant to the recommendation of the Sexual Assault Kit Working Group, which is the
38 statewide working group led by the Office of the Attorney General to create policies and
39 procedures to address the backlog of sexual assault forensic evidence kits that have not been
40 tested. (NRS 200.3788) Section 9 of this bill requires such a designation to instead be made
41 pursuant to the recommendation of the Committee.
42 Existing law creates the Account for Programs Related to Domestic Violence and
43 authorizes the Ombudsman for Victims of Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault and Human
44 Trafficking to expend money in the Account for certain purposes relating to domestic
45 violence, including training certain persons about domestic violence, assisting victims of
46 domestic violence and educating the public on domestic violence. (NRS 228.460) Section 3 of
47 this bill authorizes the Ombudsman to expend money in the Account for such purposes as they
48 relate to sexual assault. Section 3 additionally renames the Account for Programs Related to
49 Domestic Violence as the Account for Programs Related to Domestic Violence and Sexual
50 Assault to reflect the changes made by section 3 to the scope of authorized expenditures from
51 the Account. Sections 5 and 6 of this bill make conforming changes to reflect the renaming of
52 the Account.

ASSEMBLY BILL NO. 45–COMMITTEE
ON GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS
(ON BEHALF OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL)
PREFILED NOVEMBER 19, 2024
_______________
Referred to Committee on Government Affairs
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to certain public bodies. (BDR 18-504)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public bodies; revising provisions relating to the Victim
Information Notification Everyday System in the Office of the
Attorney General; renaming the Account for Programs Related to
Domestic Violence; revising provisions governing the expenditures
authorized from the Account; renaming the Committee on Domestic
Violence; revising the membership and duties of the Committee;
transferring certain duties from the Sexual Assault Kit Working Group
to the Committee; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates in the Office of the Attorney General the Victim Information
2 Notification Everyday System, which consists of a toll-free telephone number and an
3 Internet website through which victims of crime and members of the public may register
4 to receive automated information and notification concerning changes in the custody
5 status of an offender. (NRS 228.205) Section 1 of this bill instead creates a victim
6 notification system in the Office of the Attorney General and replaces references to the
7 Victim Information Notification Everyday System with references to the newly created
8 victim notification system.
9 Existing law creates the Committee on Domestic Violence and requires the Committee to
10 carry out certain duties relating to domestic violence, including increasing awareness,
11 reviewing certain programs provided to peace officers for training related to domestic
12 violence and making recommendations regarding such training, providing financial support to
13 certain programs for the prevention of domestic violence under certain circumstances and
14 studying certain issues relating to domestic violence. (NRS 228.470) Section 4 of this bill
15 requires the Committee to also perform such duties as they relate to sexual assault.
16 Section 4 also requires the Committee to: (1) make recommendations relating to the need
17 for additional sexual assault victims’ advocates; (2) make recommendations relating to the
18 need for ongoing evaluation of the rights of survivors; and (3) review the effectiveness of the
19 statewide program to track sexual assault forensic evidence kits.
20 Section 4 further renames the Committee on Domestic Violence to the Committee on
21 Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault to reflect the expansion of the duties of the

Assembly Amendment No. 64 to Assembly Bill No. 45 Page 4
22 Committee. Sections 1, 2, 7, 8 and 10-16 of this bill make conforming changes to reflect the
23 renaming of the Committee.
24 Existing law sets forth the membership of the Committee, which consists of: (1) certain
25 persons appointed by the Attorney General, including two survivors of domestic violence; and
26 (2) one member who is a representative of the Division of Public and Behavioral Health of the
27 Department of Health and Human Services who has certain experience and is appointed by the
28 Administrator of the Division. (NRS 228.470) Section 4 revises the membership of the
29 Committee by reducing the number of survivors of domestic violence who are members of the

44 Trafficking to expend money in the Account for certain purposes relating to domestic
45 violence, including training certain persons about domestic violence, assisting victims of
46 domestic violence and educating the public on domestic violence. (NRS 228.460) Section 3 of
47 this bill authorizes the Ombudsman to expend money in the Account for such purposes as they
48 relate to sexual assault. Section 3 additionally renames the Account for Programs Related to
49 Domestic Violence as the Account for Programs Related to Domestic Violence and Sexual

51 the Account. Sections 5 and 6 of this bill make conforming changes to reflect the renaming of
