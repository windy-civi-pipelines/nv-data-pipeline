Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law creates in the Office of the Attorney General the Victim
Information Notification Everyday System, which consists of a toll-free telephone
number and an Internet website through which victims of crime and members of the
public may register to receive automated information and notification concerning
changes in the custody status of an offender. (NRS 228.205) Section 1 of this bill
instead creates a victim notification system in the Office of the Attorney General
and replaces references to the Victim Information Notification Everyday System
with references to the newly created victim notification system.
Existing law creates the Committee on Domestic Violence and requires the
Committee to carry out certain duties relating to domestic violence, including
increasing awareness, reviewing certain programs provided to peace officers for
training related to domestic violence and making recommendations regarding such
training, providing financial support to certain programs for the prevention of
domestic violence under certain circumstances and studying certain issues relating
to domestic violence. (NRS 228.470) Section 4 of this bill requires the Committee
to also perform such duties as they relate to sexual assault.
Section 4 also requires the Committee to: (1) make recommendations relating
to the need for additional sexual assault victims’ advocates; (2) make
recommendations relating to the need for ongoing evaluation of the rights of
survivors; and (3) review the effectiveness of the statewide program to track sexual
assault forensic evidence kits.
Section 4 further renames the Committee on Domestic Violence to the
Committee on Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault to reflect the expansion of
the duties of the Committee. Sections 1, 2, 7, 8 and 10-16 of this bill make
conforming changes to reflect the renaming of the Committee.
Existing law sets forth the membership of the Committee, which consists of: (1)
certain persons appointed by the Attorney General, including two survivors of
domestic violence; and (2) one member who is a representative of the Division of
Public and Behavioral Health of the Department of Health and Human Services
who has certain experience and is appointed by the Administrator of the Division.
(NRS 228.470) Section 4 revises the membership of the Committee by reducing the
number of survivors of domestic violence who are members of the Committee from
two to one and requiring the Attorney General to additionally appoint to the
Committee: (1) one staff member of a program for victims of sexual assault; (2)
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 2 –
one survivor of sexual assault; and (3) one medical professional with experience in
working with sexual assault forensic evidence kits.
Existing law requires the Attorney General to designate a department or
division of the Executive Department of State Government to establish a statewide
program to track sexual assault forensic evidence kits. Existing law further requires
such a designation to be made pursuant to the recommendation of the Sexual
Assault Kit Working Group, which is the statewide working group led by the
Office of the Attorney General to create policies and procedures to address the
backlog of sexual assault forensic evidence kits that have not been tested. (NRS
200.3788) Section 9 of this bill requires such a designation to instead be made
pursuant to the recommendation of the Committee.
Existing law creates the Account for Programs Related to Domestic Violence
and authorizes the Ombudsman for Victims of Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault
and Human Trafficking to expend money in the Account for certain purposes
relating to domestic violence, including training certain persons about domestic
violence, assisting victims of domestic violence and educating the public on
domestic violence. (NRS 228.460) Section 3 of this bill authorizes the Ombudsman
to expend money in the Account for such purposes as they relate to sexual assault.
Section 3 additionally renames the Account for Programs Related to Domestic
Violence as the Account for Programs Related to Domestic Violence and Sexual
Assault to reflect the changes made by section 3 to the scope of authorized
expenditures from the Account. Sections 5 and 6 of this bill make conforming
changes to reflect the renaming of the Account.
