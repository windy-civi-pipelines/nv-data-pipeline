Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates in the Office of the Attorney General the Victim
2 Information Notification Everyday System, which consists of a toll-free telephone
3 number and an Internet website through which victims of crime and members of the
4 public may register to receive automated information and notification concerning
5 changes in the custody status of an offender. (NRS 228.205) Section 1 of this bill
6 instead creates a victim notification system in the Office of the Attorney General
7 and replaces references to the Victim Information Notification Everyday System
8 with references to the newly created victim notification system.
9 Existing law creates the Committee on Domestic Violence and requires the
10 Committee to carry out certain duties relating to domestic violence, including
11 increasing awareness, reviewing certain programs provided to peace officers for
12 training related to domestic violence and making recommendations regarding such
13 training, providing financial support to certain programs for the prevention of
14 domestic violence under certain circumstances and studying certain issues relating
-
*AB45_R1*

15 to domestic violence. (NRS 228.470) Section 4 of this bill requires the Committee
16 to also perform such duties as they relate to sexual assault.
17 Section 4 also requires the Committee to: (1) make recommendations relating
18 to the need for additional sexual assault victims’ advocates; (2) make
19 recommendations relating to the need for ongoing evaluation of the rights of
20 survivors; and (3) review the effectiveness of the statewide program to track sexual
21 assault forensic evidence kits.
22 Section 4 further renames the Committee on Domestic Violence to the
23 Committee on Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault to reflect the expansion of
24 the duties of the Committee. Sections 1, 2, 7, 8 and 10-16 of this bill make
25 conforming changes to reflect the renaming of the Committee.
26 Existing law sets forth the membership of the Committee, which consists of: (1)
27 certain persons appointed by the Attorney General, including two survivors of
28 domestic violence; and (2) one member who is a representative of the Division of
29 Public and Behavioral Health of the Department of Health and Human Services
30 who has certain experience and is appointed by the Administrator of the Division.
31 (NRS 228.470) Section 4 revises the membership of the Committee by reducing the
32 number of survivors of domestic violence who are members of the Committee from
33 two to one and requiring the Attorney General to additionally appoint to the
34 Committee: (1) one staff member of a program for victims of sexual assault; (2)
35 one survivor of sexual assault; and (3) one medical professional with experience in
36 working with sexual assault forensic evidence kits.
37 Existing law requires the Attorney General to designate a department or
38 division of the Executive Department of State Government to establish a statewide
39 program to track sexual assault forensic evidence kits. Existing law further requires
40 such a designation to be made pursuant to the recommendation of the Sexual
41 Assault Kit Working Group, which is the statewide working group led by the
42 Office of the Attorney General to create policies and procedures to address the
43 backlog of sexual assault forensic evidence kits that have not been tested. (NRS
44 200.3788) Section 9 of this bill requires such a designation to instead be made
45 pursuant to the recommendation of the Committee.
46 Existing law creates the Account for Programs Related to Domestic Violence
47 and authorizes the Ombudsman for Victims of Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault
48 and Human Trafficking to expend money in the Account for certain purposes
49 relating to domestic violence, including training certain persons about domestic
50 violence, assisting victims of domestic violence and educating the public on
51 domestic violence. (NRS 228.460) Section 3 of this bill authorizes the Ombudsman
52 to expend money in the Account for such purposes as they relate to sexual assault.
53 Section 3 additionally renames the Account for Programs Related to Domestic
54 Violence as the Account for Programs Related to Domestic Violence and Sexual
55 Assault to reflect the changes made by section 3 to the scope of authorized
56 expenditures from the Account. Sections 5 and 6 of this bill make conforming
57 changes to reflect the renaming of the Account.

ON GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS
(ON BEHALF OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL)
PREFILED NOVEMBER 19, 2024
____________
Referred to Committee on Government Affairs
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to certain public bodies.
(BDR 18-504)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public bodies; revising provisions relating to

provisions governing the expenditures authorized from
the Account; renaming the Committee on Domestic
Violence; revising the membership and duties of the
Committee; transferring certain duties from the Sexual

providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates in the Office of the Attorney General the Victim

3 number and an Internet website through which victims of crime and members of the
4 public may register to receive automated information and notification concerning
5 changes in the custody status of an offender. (NRS 228.205) Section 1 of this bill
6 instead creates a victim notification system in the Office of the Attorney General
7 and replaces references to the Victim Information Notification Everyday System
8 with references to the newly created victim notification system.
9 Existing law creates the Committee on Domestic Violence and requires the
10 Committee to carry out certain duties relating to domestic violence, including
11 increasing awareness, reviewing certain programs provided to peace officers for
