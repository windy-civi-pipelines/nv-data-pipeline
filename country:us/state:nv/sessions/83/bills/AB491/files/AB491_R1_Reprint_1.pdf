7 of when the county or city clerk will provide the information or data; or (3) a
8 written explanation that the county or city clerk does not have the information or
9 data.
10 Existing law requires a person to be a qualified elector to be eligible for a
11 public office in this State. (Nev. Const. Art. 15, § 3) Existing law also requires,
12 with certain exceptions, a candidate for any elected office to actually, as opposed to
13 constructively, reside in the State, district, county, township or other area
14 prescribed by law to which the office pertains. (NRS 293.1755) Sections 2 and 7-

26 file a declaration of candidacy and a candidate for the office of State Senator,
27 Assemblyman or Assemblywoman to also file a declaration of residency. (NRS
28 293.177, 293.181, 293C.185) Existing law also requires a person nominated or
29 applying to fill a vacancy in the office of Legislator to file a declaration of
30 eligibility with the board of county commissioners. (NRS 218A.264) Sections 3, 4,
31 6 and 13 of this bill provide that a declaration of candidacy, a declaration of

33 must make such declarations available to the public in an electronic format.
