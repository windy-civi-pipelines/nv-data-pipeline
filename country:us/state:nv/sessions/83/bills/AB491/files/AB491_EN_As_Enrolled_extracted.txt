CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to elections; requiring a county or city clerk to
provide certain information or data relating to the current
election cycle within a certain period of time; revising
qualifications for certain elected public officers to require
such officers to be registered to vote in this State; revising
provisions governing a declaration of candidacy and
declaration of residency; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:

Section 2:
Section 1 of this bill provides that if the Secretary of State requests any
information or data relating to the current election cycle from a county or city clerk,
the clerk is required, not later than the end of the second working day after
receiving the request, to provide the Secretary of State with: (1) the information or
data; or (2) a written explanation that indicates when the county or city clerk will
reasonably be able to provide the information or data.
Existing law requires a person to be a qualified elector to be eligible for a
public office in this State. (Nev. Const. Art. 15, § 3) Existing law also requires,
with certain exceptions, a candidate for any elected office to actually, as opposed to
constructively, reside in the State, district, county, township or other area
prescribed by law to which the office pertains. (NRS 293.1755) Sections 2 and 7-
77 of this bill include as a qualification for any elected public office other than
federal office, including, without limitation, State Legislator, Governor, Lieutenant
Governor, Attorney General, Secretary of State, State Treasurer, State Controller,
county commissioners, county clerk, sheriff, district attorney, public administrator,
city council, mayor, the Board of Regents of the University of Nevada, the board of
directors of a general improvement district and the board of directors of a water
district, that the officer be registered to vote in the State, district, county, township
or other area prescribed by law to which the officer is required to reside. Section 78
of this bill provides that the requirement for these officers to be registered to vote in
this State does not apply to a person who, on October 1, 2025, holds such office.
Existing law requires a candidate for a primary election for a public office to
file a declaration of candidacy and a candidate for the office of State Senator,
Assemblyman or Assemblywoman to also file a declaration of residency. (NRS

Section 3:
293.177, 293.181, 293C.185) Existing law also requires a person nominated or
applying to fill a vacancy in the office of Legislator to file a declaration of
eligibility with the board of county commissioners. (NRS 218A.264) Sections 3, 4,
6 and 13 of this bill provide that a declaration of candidacy, a declaration of
residency and a declaration of eligibility are public records and the filing officer
must make such declarations available to the public in an electronic format.

Section 4:
Sections 3, 6 and 13 also require a person filing a declaration of candidacy or
declaration of eligibility to attest under penalty of perjury to the city or town and
county of the State of Nevada where the person is registered to vote.

Raw Text:
Assembly Bill No. 491–Committee on
Legislative Operations and Elections
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to elections; requiring a county or city clerk to
provide certain information or data relating to the current
election cycle within a certain period of time; revising
qualifications for certain elected public officers to require
such officers to be registered to vote in this State; revising
provisions governing a declaration of candidacy and
declaration of residency; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Section 1 of this bill provides that if the Secretary of State requests any
information or data relating to the current election cycle from a county or city clerk,
the clerk is required, not later than the end of the second working day after
receiving the request, to provide the Secretary of State with: (1) the information or
data; or (2) a written explanation that indicates when the county or city clerk will
reasonably be able to provide the information or data.
Existing law requires a person to be a qualified elector to be eligible for a
public office in this State. (Nev. Const. Art. 15, § 3) Existing law also requires,
with certain exceptions, a candidate for any elected office to actually, as opposed to
constructively, reside in the State, district, county, township or other area
prescribed by law to which the office pertains. (NRS 293.1755) Sections 2 and 7-
77 of this bill include as a qualification for any elected public office other than
federal office, including, without limitation, State Legislator, Governor, Lieutenant
Governor, Attorney General, Secretary of State, State Treasurer, State Controller,
county commissioners, county clerk, sheriff, district attorney, public administrator,
city council, mayor, the Board of Regents of the University of Nevada, the board of
directors of a general improvement district and the board of directors of a water
district, that the officer be registered to vote in the State, district, county, township
or other area prescribed by law to which the officer is required to reside. Section 78
of this bill provides that the requirement for these officers to be registered to vote in
this State does not apply to a person who, on October 1, 2025, holds such office.
Existing law requires a candidate for a primary election for a public office to
file a declaration of candidacy and a candidate for the office of State Senator,
Assemblyman or Assemblywoman to also file a declaration of residency. (NRS
293.177, 293.181, 293C.185) Existing law also requires a person nominated or
applying to fill a vacancy in the office of Legislator to file a declaration of
eligibility with the board of county commissioners. (NRS 218A.264) Sections 3, 4,
6 and 13 of this bill provide that a declaration of candidacy, a declaration of
residency and a declaration of eligibility are public records and the filing officer
must make such declarations available to the public in an electronic format.
Sections 3, 6 and 13 also require a person filing a declaration of candidacy or
declaration of eligibility to attest under penalty of perjury to the city or town and
county of the State of Nevada where the person is registered to vote.
