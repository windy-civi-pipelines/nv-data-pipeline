AN ACT relating to elections; requiring a county or city clerk to provide certain

provisions governing a declaration of candidacy and declaration of

properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Section 1 of this bill [requires, with certain exceptions,] provides that if the Secretary
2 of State requests any information or data relating to an election from a county or city
3 clerk , the clerk is required, not later than the end of the second calendar day after
4 receiving the request, to [: (1) respond to a request from] provide the Secretary of State [for]
5 with: (1) the information or data ; [relating to an election not later than 48 hours after
6 receiving the request with the information or data requested; or] (2) [provide] a written
7 explanation [as to why the county or city clerk is unable to comply.] that the county or city
8 clerk will not be able to provide the information or data by the end of the second
9 calendar day, along with an estimate of when the county or city clerk will provide the
10 information or data; or (3) a written explanation that the county or city clerk does not
11 have the information or data.
12 Existing law requires a person to be a qualified elector to be eligible for a public office in
13 this State. (Nev. Const. Art. 15, § 3) Existing law also requires, with certain exceptions, a
14 candidate for any elected office to actually, as opposed to constructively, reside in the State,
15 district, county, township or other area prescribed by law to which the office pertains. (NRS
16 293.1755) Sections 2 and 7-77 of this bill include as a qualification for any elected public
17 office other than federal office, including, without limitation, State Legislator, Governor,
18 Lieutenant Governor, Attorney General, Secretary of State, State Treasurer, State Controller,
19 county commissioners, county clerk, sheriff, district attorney, public administrator, city
20 council, mayor, the Board of Regents, the board of directors of a general improvement district
21 and the board of directors of a water district, that the officer be registered to vote in the State,
22 district, county, township or other area prescribed by law to which the officer is required to

Assembly Amendment No. 383 to Assembly Bill No. 491 Page 4
23 reside. Section 78 of this bill provides that the requirement for these officers to be registered
24 to vote in this State does not apply to a person who, on October 1, 2025, holds such office.
25 Existing law requires a candidate for a primary election for a public office to file a
26 declaration of candidacy and a candidate for the office of State Senator, Assemblyman or
27 Assemblywoman to also file a declaration of residency. (NRS 293.177, 293.181, 293C.185)
28 Existing law also requires a person nominated or applying to fill a vacancy in the office of
29 Legislator to file a declaration of eligibility with the board of county commissioners. (NRS
30 218A.264) Sections 3, 4, 6 and 13 of this bill provide that a declaration of candidacy, a
31 declaration of residency and a declaration of eligibility are public records and the filing officer
32 must make such declarations available to the public in an electronic format.
33 Sections 3, 6 and 13 also require a person filing a declaration of candidacy or declaration
34 of eligibility to attest under penalty of perjury to the city or town and county of the State of
35 Nevada where the person is registered to vote.
36 [Existing law requires an independent candidate for partisan office to file with the
37 appropriate filing officer a petition of candidacy not earlier than the first Monday in March
38 preceding the general election and not later than 5 p.m. on the third Friday in June. (NRS
39 293.200) Section 5 of this bill revises the date by which the petition must be filed from the
40 third Friday in June to the Friday in June immediately after the primary election.]
