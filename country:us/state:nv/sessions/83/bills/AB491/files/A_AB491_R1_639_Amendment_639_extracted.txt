Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Section 1 of this bill provides that if the Secretary of State requests any information or
2 data relating to [an] the current election cycle from a county or city clerk, the clerk is
3 required, not later than the end of the second [calendar] working day after receiving the
4 request, to provide the Secretary of State with: (1) the information or data; or (2) a written
5 explanation that indicates when the county or city clerk will [not] reasonably be able to
6 provide the information or data . [by the end of the second calendar day, along with an
7 estimate of when the county or city clerk will provide the information or data; or (3) a written
8 explanation that the county or city clerk does not have the information or data.]
9 Existing law requires a person to be a qualified elector to be eligible for a public office in
10 this State. (Nev. Const. Art. 15, § 3) Existing law also requires, with certain exceptions, a
11 candidate for any elected office to actually, as opposed to constructively, reside in the State,
12 district, county, township or other area prescribed by law to which the office pertains. (NRS
13 293.1755) Sections 2 and 7-77 of this bill include as a qualification for any elected public
14 office other than federal office, including, without limitation, State Legislator, Governor,
15 Lieutenant Governor, Attorney General, Secretary of State, State Treasurer, State Controller,
16 county commissioners, county clerk, sheriff, district attorney, public administrator, city
17 council, mayor, the Board of Regents [,] of the University of Nevada, the board of directors

19 be registered to vote in the State, district, county, township or other area prescribed by law to
20 which the officer is required to reside. Section 78 of this bill provides that the requirement for
21 these officers to be registered to vote in this State does not apply to a person who, on October
22 1, 2025, holds such office.
Senate Amendment No. 639 to Assembly Bill No. 491 First Reprint Page 4
23 Existing law requires a candidate for a primary election for a public office to file a
24 declaration of candidacy and a candidate for the office of State Senator, Assemblyman or
25 Assemblywoman to also file a declaration of residency. (NRS 293.177, 293.181, 293C.185)
26 Existing law also requires a person nominated or applying to fill a vacancy in the office of
27 Legislator to file a declaration of eligibility with the board of county commissioners. (NRS
28 218A.264) Sections 3, 4, 6 and 13 of this bill provide that a declaration of candidacy, a
29 declaration of residency and a declaration of eligibility are public records and the filing officer
30 must make such declarations available to the public in an electronic format.
31 Sections 3, 6 and 13 also require a person filing a declaration of candidacy or declaration
32 of eligibility to attest under penalty of perjury to the city or town and county of the State of

officers to require such officers to be registered to vote in this State;
revising provisions governing a declaration of candidacy and
declaration of residency; and providing other matters properly relating

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Section 1 of this bill provides that if the Secretary of State requests any information or
2 data relating to [an] the current election cycle from a county or city clerk, the clerk is
3 required, not later than the end of the second [calendar] working day after receiving the
4 request, to provide the Secretary of State with: (1) the information or data; or (2) a written
5 explanation that indicates when the county or city clerk will [not] reasonably be able to
6 provide the information or data . [by the end of the second calendar day, along with an
7 estimate of when the county or city clerk will provide the information or data; or (3) a written
8 explanation that the county or city clerk does not have the information or data.]
9 Existing law requires a person to be a qualified elector to be eligible for a public office in
10 this State. (Nev. Const. Art. 15, § 3) Existing law also requires, with certain exceptions, a
11 candidate for any elected office to actually, as opposed to constructively, reside in the State,
12 district, county, township or other area prescribed by law to which the office pertains. (NRS
13 293.1755) Sections 2 and 7-77 of this bill include as a qualification for any elected public
14 office other than federal office, including, without limitation, State Legislator, Governor,
15 Lieutenant Governor, Attorney General, Secretary of State, State Treasurer, State Controller,
16 county commissioners, county clerk, sheriff, district attorney, public administrator, city
17 council, mayor, the Board of Regents [,] of the University of Nevada, the board of directors
18 of a general improvement district and the board of directors of a water district, that the officer
19 be registered to vote in the State, district, county, township or other area prescribed by law to
20 which the officer is required to reside. Section 78 of this bill provides that the requirement for
21 these officers to be registered to vote in this State does not apply to a person who, on October
22 1, 2025, holds such office.

Senate Amendment No. 639 to Assembly Bill No. 491 First Reprint Page 4
23 Existing law requires a candidate for a primary election for a public office to file a
24 declaration of candidacy and a candidate for the office of State Senator, Assemblyman or
25 Assemblywoman to also file a declaration of residency. (NRS 293.177, 293.181, 293C.185)
26 Existing law also requires a person nominated or applying to fill a vacancy in the office of
27 Legislator to file a declaration of eligibility with the board of county commissioners. (NRS
28 218A.264) Sections 3, 4, 6 and 13 of this bill provide that a declaration of candidacy, a
29 declaration of residency and a declaration of eligibility are public records and the filing officer
30 must make such declarations available to the public in an electronic format.
31 Sections 3, 6 and 13 also require a person filing a declaration of candidacy or declaration
32 of eligibility to attest under penalty of perjury to the city or town and county of the State of
33 Nevada where the person is registered to vote.
