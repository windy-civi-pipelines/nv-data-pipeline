8 public office in this State. (Nev. Const. Art. 15, § 3) Existing law also requires,
9 with certain exceptions, a candidate for any elected office to actually, as opposed to
10 constructively, reside in the State, district, county, township or other area
11 prescribed by law to which the office pertains. (NRS 293.1755) Sections 2 and 7-

22 Existing law requires a candidate for a primary election for a public office to
23 file a declaration of candidacy and a candidate for the office of State Senator,
24 Assemblyman or Assemblywoman to also file a declaration of residency. (NRS
25 293.177, 293.181, 293C.185) Existing law also requires a person nominated or
26 applying to fill a vacancy in the office of Legislator to file a declaration of
27 eligibility with the board of county commissioners. (NRS 218A.264) Sections 3, 4,
28 6 and 13 of this bill provide that a declaration of candidacy, a declaration of
29 residency and a declaration of eligibility are public records and the filing officer
30 must make such declarations available to the public in an electronic format.
31 Sections 3, 6 and 13 also require a person filing a declaration of candidacy or
