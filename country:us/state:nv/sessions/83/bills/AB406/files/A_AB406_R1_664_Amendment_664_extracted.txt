Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law prescribes the authority and duties of a school counselor, school
2 psychologist and school social worker. (NRS 391.293, 391.294, 391.296) Section 2 of this bill
3 prohibits a public school from using artificial intelligence to perform the functions and duties
4 of a school counselor, school psychologist or school social worker which relate to the mental
5 health of pupils. Section 2 additionally requires the Department of Education to develop a
6 policy for the use of artificial intelligence by such school employees while providing
7 therapy, counseling or other mental or behavioral health services to pupils. Section 2
8 requires the policy to include a method for the Department to examine the accuracy and
9 efficacy of the use of artificial intelligence for such purposes.
10 Existing law: (1) regulates the practice and requires the licensure of certain mental health
11 professionals, including psychiatrists, psychologists, marriage and family therapists, clinical
12 professional counselors, registered nurses, social workers, alcohol and drug counselors and
13 problem gambling counselors; and (2) prohibits unlicensed persons from engaging in the
14 practices of those professions. (Chapters 630, 632, 633 and 641-641C of NRS) Section 7 of
15 this bill prohibits, with certain exceptions, an artificial intelligence provider from offering to
16 users in this State an artificial intelligence system that is specifically programmed to provide a
17 user with a service or an experience that would constitute the practice of professional mental
18 or behavioral health care if provided by a natural person. Section 7 also prohibits, with certain
19 exceptions, an artificial intelligence provider or a natural person who is not licensed to
20 practice professional mental or behavioral health care from making certain representations
21 that would lead a person to believe that the provider, the artificial intelligence system operated
22 by the provider or the natural person is capable of or qualified to provide mental or behavioral
23 health care. Section 8 of this bill imposes certain restrictions and prohibitions on the use of an
24 artificial intelligence system by a licensed provider of mental and behavioral health care.
