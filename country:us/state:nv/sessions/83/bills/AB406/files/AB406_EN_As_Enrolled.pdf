Education to develop a policy concerning certain uses of

systems; prohibiting certain persons from representing
themselves as qualified to provide mental or behavioral

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law prescribes the authority and duties of a school counselor, school
psychologist and school social worker. (NRS 391.293, 391.294, 391.296) Section 2
of this bill prohibits a public school from using artificial intelligence to perform the
functions and duties of a school counselor, school psychologist or school social
worker which relate to the mental health of pupils. Section 2 additionally requires
the Department of Education to develop a policy for the use of artificial intelligence
by such school employees while providing therapy, counseling or other mental or
behavioral health services to pupils. Section 2 requires the policy to include a
method for the Department to examine the accuracy and efficacy of the use of
artificial intelligence for such purposes.
Existing law: (1) regulates the practice and requires the licensure of certain
mental health professionals, including psychiatrists, psychologists, marriage and
family therapists, clinical professional counselors, registered nurses, social workers,
alcohol and drug counselors and problem gambling counselors; and (2) prohibits
unlicensed persons from engaging in the practices of those professions. (Chapters
630, 632, 633 and 641-641C of NRS) Section 7 of this bill prohibits, with certain
exceptions, an artificial intelligence provider from offering to users in this State an
artificial intelligence system that is specifically programmed to provide a user with
a service or an experience that would constitute the practice of professional mental
or behavioral health care if provided by a natural person. Section 7 also prohibits,
with certain exceptions, an artificial intelligence provider or a natural person who is
not licensed to practice professional mental or behavioral health care from making
certain representations that would lead a person to believe that the provider, the
artificial intelligence system operated by the provider or the natural person is
capable of or qualified to provide mental or behavioral health care. Section 8 of this
bill imposes certain restrictions and prohibitions on the use of an artificial
intelligence system by a licensed provider of mental and behavioral health care.
