promotion to the next higher grade despite absences from

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the board of trustees of a school district or governing
2 body of a charter school to ensure that information relating to mental health
3 resources appears on the back of any identification card issued to a pupil at a school
4 within the school district or the charter school. (NRS 388.1335) Section 1 of this
5 bill requires each public school to publish on an Internet website maintained by the
6 school and to provide at the school information relating to mental health and certain
7 resources for caring for the mental health of pupils. Section 1 also requires each
8 public school to conduct a live assembly at least once every 3 months during the
-
*AB406*
– 2 –
9 school year for the pupils of the school to provide education and information
10 relating to mental health.
11 Existing law prescribes the authority and duties of a school counselor, school
12 psychologist and school social worker. (NRS 391.293, 391.294, 391.296) Section 2
13 of this bill prohibits a public school from using artificial intelligence to perform the
14 functions and duties of a school counselor, school psychologist or school social
15 worker which relate to the mental health of pupils.
16 Existing law, in general, requires a child between 6 and 18 years of age to
17 attend public school. (NRS 392.040) Existing law requires the board of trustees of a
18 school district to prescribe a minimum number of days that a pupil must be in
19 attendance for the pupil to obtain credit or be promoted to the next higher grade.
20 (NRS 392.122) Existing law excuses a child from those attendance requirements
21 when satisfactory written evidence, including a certificate from certain providers of
22 health care, is presented to the board of trustees of the school district in which the
23 child resides that the child’s physical or mental condition or behavioral health is
24 such as to prevent or render inadvisable the child’s attendance at school or his or
25 her application to study. (NRS 392.050) Section 3 of this bill additionally excuses a
26 child from attendance for the dates immediately preceding and immediately
27 following any date or dates to which a certificate from a provider of health care
28 applies.
29 Existing law deems as a truant a pupil who is absent from school without the
30 approval of a teacher or principal of the school, unless the pupil is absent: (1)
31 because the pupil is physically or mentally unable to attend school; or (2) for the
32 observance of a religious holiday. (NRS 391.130) A day on which a pupil is absent
33 for those reasons must be: (1) deemed as approved, with certain exceptions; and (2)
34 credited towards the minimum number of days that a pupil must be in attendance to
35 obtain credit or be promoted to the next higher grade, if the pupil has completed
36 course-work requirements. (NRS 392.122, 392.130) Section 6 of this bill provides
37 that a pupil is not a truant if the pupil is absent from school: (1) for the bereavement
38 of the death of an immediate family member; (2) because the pupil is experiencing
39 distress relating to bullying; or (3) for certain other mental or behavioral health
40 reasons. Section 6 requires the parent or legal guardian or other person having
41 control or charge of a pupil who is absent from school for those reasons to notify
42 the teacher or principal of the school within 3 days after the absence. Section 6 then
43 deems those absences as approved, except that only a certain amount of absences
44 for each reason may be approved within 1 school year. Section 5 of this bill
45 requires those days on which the pupil was absent under those circumstances to be
46 credited towards the minimum number of days that the pupil must be in attendance
47 to obtain credit or be promoted to the next higher grade, if the pupil has completed
48 course-work requirements. Section 4 of this bill provides that an absence that is
49 approved under those circumstances is not considered an absence that a school is
50 required to indicate on a report card issued to a pupil.
51 Section 5 prohibits the denial of credit to a pupil or the promotion of a pupil to
52 the next higher grade because the pupil did not attend school for the minimum
53 number of days required if: (1) the pupil has earned at least a weighted 3.0 grade
54 point average, on a 4.0 grading scale, for the school year; and (2) the absences,
55 without which would otherwise allow the pupil to receive credit or be promoted to
56 the next grade, were caused by or relate to bullying or physical, mental or
57 behavioral health.
58 Existing law: (1) regulates the practice and requires the licensure of certain
59 mental health professionals, including psychiatrists, psychologists, marriage and
60 family therapists, clinical professional counselors, registered nurses, social workers,
61 alcohol and drug counselors and problem gambling counselors; and (2) prohibits
62 unlicensed persons from engaging in the practices of those professions. (Chapters
63 630, 632, 633 and 641-641C of NRS) Section 7 of this bill prohibits, with certain
-
*AB406*
– 3 –
64 exceptions, an artificial intelligence provider from offering to users in this State an
65 artificial intelligence system that is specifically programmed to provide a user with
66 a service or an experience that would constitute the practice of professional mental
67 or behavioral health care if provided by a natural person. Section 7 also prohibits,
68 with certain exceptions, an artificial intelligence provider or a natural person who is
69 not licensed to practice professional mental or behavioral health care from making
70 certain representations that would lead a person to believe that the provider, the
71 artificial intelligence system operated by the provider or the natural person is
72 capable of or qualified to provide mental or behavioral health care. Section 8 of this
73 bill imposes certain restrictions and prohibitions on the use of an artificial
74 intelligence system by a licensed provider of mental and behavioral health care.

28 (3) A physical or mental condition of the pupil; and

32 higher grade for the failure to comply with the attendance
33 requirements prescribed pursuant to subsection 1.
34 5. For the purposes of this section, the days on which a pupil is
35 not in attendance because the pupil is absent for [the observance of a
36 religious holiday] a reason described in subsections 6 to 9,

ASSEMBLY BILL NO. 406–ASSEMBLYMEMBERS
JACKSON AND NADEEM
MARCH 11, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Education
SUMMARY—Makes various changes relating to health.
(BDR 34-674)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
CONTAINS UNFUNDED MANDATE (§ 1)
(NOT REQUESTED BY AFFECTED LOCAL GOVERNMENT)
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health; requiring a public school to provide
certain information relating to mental health to pupils;
prohibiting certain uses of artificial intelligence in public
schools; requiring that a pupil be allowed credit or
promotion to the next higher grade despite absences from
school in certain circumstances; deeming certain absences
from school to be approved absences; imposing certain
restrictions relating to the marketing and programming of
artificial intelligence systems; prohibiting certain persons
from representing themselves as qualified to provide
mental or behavioral health care; imposing certain
restrictions relating to the use of artificial intelligence by
providers of mental or behavioral health care; providing
civil penalties; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the board of trustees of a school district or governing
2 body of a charter school to ensure that information relating to mental health
3 resources appears on the back of any identification card issued to a pupil at a school
4 within the school district or the charter school. (NRS 388.1335) Section 1 of this
5 bill requires each public school to publish on an Internet website maintained by the
6 school and to provide at the school information relating to mental health and certain
7 resources for caring for the mental health of pupils. Section 1 also requires each
8 public school to conduct a live assembly at least once every 3 months during the
-
*AB406*

– 2 –
9 school year for the pupils of the school to provide education and information
10 relating to mental health.
11 Existing law prescribes the authority and duties of a school counselor, school
12 psychologist and school social worker. (NRS 391.293, 391.294, 391.296) Section 2
13 of this bill prohibits a public school from using artificial intelligence to perform the
14 functions and duties of a school counselor, school psychologist or school social
15 worker which relate to the mental health of pupils.
16 Existing law, in general, requires a child between 6 and 18 years of age to
17 attend public school. (NRS 392.040) Existing law requires the board of trustees of a
18 school district to prescribe a minimum number of days that a pupil must be in
19 attendance for the pupil to obtain credit or be promoted to the next higher grade.
20 (NRS 392.122) Existing law excuses a child from those attendance requirements
21 when satisfactory written evidence, including a certificate from certain providers of
22 health care, is presented to the board of trustees of the school district in which the
23 child resides that the child’s physical or mental condition or behavioral health is
24 such as to prevent or render inadvisable the child’s attendance at school or his or
25 her application to study. (NRS 392.050) Section 3 of this bill additionally excuses a
26 child from attendance for the dates immediately preceding and immediately
27 following any date or dates to which a certificate from a provider of health care
28 applies.
29 Existing law deems as a truant a pupil who is absent from school without the
30 approval of a teacher or principal of the school, unless the pupil is absent: (1)
31 because the pupil is physically or mentally unable to attend school; or (2) for the
32 observance of a religious holiday. (NRS 391.130) A day on which a pupil is absent
33 for those reasons must be: (1) deemed as approved, with certain exceptions; and (2)
34 credited towards the minimum number of days that a pupil must be in attendance to
35 obtain credit or be promoted to the next higher grade, if the pupil has completed
36 course-work requirements. (NRS 392.122, 392.130) Section 6 of this bill provides
37 that a pupil is not a truant if the pupil is absent from school: (1) for the bereavement
38 of the death of an immediate family member; (2) because the pupil is experiencing
39 distress relating to bullying; or (3) for certain other mental or behavioral health
40 reasons. Section 6 requires the parent or legal guardian or other person having
41 control or charge of a pupil who is absent from school for those reasons to notify
42 the teacher or principal of the school within 3 days after the absence. Section 6 then
43 deems those absences as approved, except that only a certain amount of absences
44 for each reason may be approved within 1 school year. Section 5 of this bill
45 requires those days on which the pupil was absent under those circumstances to be
46 credited towards the minimum number of days that the pupil must be in attendance
47 to obtain credit or be promoted to the next higher grade, if the pupil has completed
48 course-work requirements. Section 4 of this bill provides that an absence that is
49 approved under those circumstances is not considered an absence that a school is
50 required to indicate on a report card issued to a pupil.
51 Section 5 prohibits the denial of credit to a pupil or the promotion of a pupil to
52 the next higher grade because the pupil did not attend school for the minimum
53 number of days required if: (1) the pupil has earned at least a weighted 3.0 grade
54 point average, on a 4.0 grading scale, for the school year; and (2) the absences,
55 without which would otherwise allow the pupil to receive credit or be promoted to
56 the next grade, were caused by or relate to bullying or physical, mental or
57 behavioral health.
58 Existing law: (1) regulates the practice and requires the licensure of certain
59 mental health professionals, including psychiatrists, psychologists, marriage and
60 family therapists, clinical professional counselors, registered nurses, social workers,
61 alcohol and drug counselors and problem gambling counselors; and (2) prohibits
62 unlicensed persons from engaging in the practices of those professions. (Chapters
63 630, 632, 633 and 641-641C of NRS) Section 7 of this bill prohibits, with certain
-
*AB406*

– 3 –
64 exceptions, an artificial intelligence provider from offering to users in this State an
65 artificial intelligence system that is specifically programmed to provide a user with
66 a service or an experience that would constitute the practice of professional mental
67 or behavioral health care if provided by a natural person. Section 7 also prohibits,
68 with certain exceptions, an artificial intelligence provider or a natural person who is
69 not licensed to practice professional mental or behavioral health care from making
70 certain representations that would lead a person to believe that the provider, the
71 artificial intelligence system operated by the provider or the natural person is
72 capable of or qualified to provide mental or behavioral health care. Section 8 of this
73 bill imposes certain restrictions and prohibitions on the use of an artificial
74 intelligence system by a licensed provider of mental and behavioral health care.

13 thereto a new section to read as follows:
14 1. A public school, including, without limitation, a charter

16 use artificial intelligence to perform the functions and duties of a
17 school counselor, school psychologist or school social worker as
18 prescribed in NRS 391.293, 391.294 and 391.296, respectively,
19 which relate to the mental health of pupils.
20 2. As used in this section, “artificial intelligence” means a

22 intelligence through one or more technological means, including,
23 without limitation, utilizing or deploying:
24 (a) Systems for machine learning;
25 (b) Large language models; or

29 by the provisions of NRS 392.040 when satisfactory written
30 evidence is presented to the board of trustees of the school district in
31 which the child resides that the child’s physical or mental condition
32 or behavioral health is such as to prevent or render inadvisable the
33 child’s attendance at school or his or her application to study. A
34 child must also be excused from attendance required by the

– 5 –
1 NRS 388.417, qualifies as a pupil with a disability, shall make
2 available to the child a free appropriate public education in
3 compliance with the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20
4 U.S.C. §§ 1400 et seq.), as that act existed on July 1, 1995.
5 4. If a pupil is excused from attendance pursuant to subsection
6 1, the excusal must not negatively affect the rating of a public
7 school as determined by the Department pursuant to the statewide
8 system of accountability for public schools.
9 Sec. 4. NRS 392.118 is hereby amended to read as follows:
10 392.118 1. The board of trustees of each school district shall
11 adopt rules that require each public school in the district to include
12 the accounting of attendance and, if feasible, tardiness of a pupil on
13 each report card or other report of progress of the pupil. The report
14 card or other report of progress must indicate the number of
15 absences, if any, for the period covered by the report card or other
16 report of progress.
17 2. An absence [for the observance of a religious holiday] which
18 is approved pursuant to [subsection 6 of] NRS 392.130 must not be
19 counted as an absence for the purposes of this section.
20 Sec. 5. NRS 392.122 is hereby amended to read as follows:
21 392.122 1. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 389.320,

23 minimum number of days that a pupil who is subject to compulsory
24 enrollment and attendance and enrolled in a school in the district
25 must be in attendance for the pupil to obtain credit or to be
26 promoted to the next higher grade. The board of trustees of a school
27 district may adopt a policy prescribing:
28 (a) A minimum number of days that a pupil who is enrolled in
29 kindergarten or first grade in the school district must be in
30 attendance for the pupil to obtain credit or to be promoted to the
31 next higher grade.
32 (b) The circumstances under which a pupil will be considered
33 chronically absent by the Department.
34 2. Before a pupil is denied credit or promotion to the next

37 which the pupil is enrolled or the principal’s designee shall provide
38 written notice of the intended denial to the parent or legal guardian

45 documentation that the pupil has complied with the attendance
-
*AB406*

– 6 –
1 requirements prescribed pursuant to subsection 1 by attending
2 school, either in person or through an alternative program of
3 education or a program of distance education approved by the
4 Department. If the documentation is accurate and the principal or
5 principal’s designee finds that any absence of the pupil was entered

7 must be recalculated for the purposes of determining whether the
8 pupil may obtain credit or be promoted to the next higher grade.
9 3. A pupil and the pupil’s parent or legal guardian may appeal

11 subsection 2 to the board of trustees of the school district in which
12 the pupil is enrolled.
13 4. A pupil must not be denied credit or promotion to the next
14 higher grade for the failure to comply with the attendance
15 requirements prescribed pursuant to subsection 1 if:

22 subsection 1;
23 (b) The pupil or the legal guardian or other person having
24 control or charge of the pupil represents that one or more of the
25 absences of the pupil were caused by or related to:
26 (1) Distress caused by bullying at school;
27 (2) The mental or behavioral health of the pupil; or
28 (3) A physical or mental condition of the pupil; and
29 (c) The number of days that the pupil was absent from school,
30 excluding the number of absences described in paragraph (b), are
31 insufficient to deny the pupil credit or promotion to the next
