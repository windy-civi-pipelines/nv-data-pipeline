EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health; [requiring a public school to provide certain
information relating to mental health to pupils;] prohibiting certain
uses of artificial intelligence in public schools; [requiring that a pupil
be allowed credit or promotion to the next higher grade despite
absences from school in certain circumstances; deeming certain
absences from school to be approved absences;] imposing certain
restrictions relating to the marketing and programming of artificial
intelligence systems; prohibiting certain persons from representing
themselves as qualified to provide mental or behavioral health care;
imposing certain restrictions relating to the use of artificial intelligence
by providers of mental or behavioral health care; providing civil
penalties; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 [Existing law requires the board of trustees of a school district or governing body of a
2 charter school to ensure that information relating to mental health resources appears on the
3 back of any identification card issued to a pupil at a school within the school district or the
4 charter school. (NRS 388.1335) Section 1 of this bill requires each public school to publish on
5 an Internet website maintained by the school and to provide at the school information relating
6 to mental health and certain resources for caring for the mental health of pupils. Section 1 also
7 requires each public school to conduct a live assembly at least once every 3 months during the
8 school year for the pupils of the school to provide education and information relating to
9 mental health.]
10 Existing law prescribes the authority and duties of a school counselor, school
11 psychologist and school social worker. (NRS 391.293, 391.294, 391.296) Section 2 of this bill
12 prohibits a public school from using artificial intelligence to perform the functions and duties
13 of a school counselor, school psychologist or school social worker which relate to the mental
14 health of pupils.
15 [Existing law, in general, requires a child between 6 and 18 years of age to attend public
16 school. (NRS 392.040) Existing law requires the board of trustees of a school district to
17 prescribe a minimum number of days that a pupil must be in attendance for the pupil to obtain
Assembly Amendment No. 389 to Assembly Bill No. 406 Page 4
18 credit or be promoted to the next higher grade. (NRS 392.122) Existing law excuses a child
19 from those attendance requirements when satisfactory written evidence, including a certificate
20 from certain providers of health care, is presented to the board of trustees of the school district
21 in which the child resides that the child’s physical or mental condition or behavioral health is
22 such as to prevent or render inadvisable the child’s attendance at school or his or her
23 application to study. (NRS 392.050) Section 3 of this bill additionally excuses a child from
24 attendance for the dates immediately preceding and immediately following any date or dates
25 to which a certificate from a provider of health care applies.
26 Existing law deems as a truant a pupil who is absent from school without the approval of
27 a teacher or principal of the school, unless the pupil is absent: (1) because the pupil is
28 physically or mentally unable to attend school; or (2) for the observance of a religious holiday.
29 (NRS 391.130) A day on which a pupil is absent for those reasons must be: (1) deemed as
30 approved, with certain exceptions; and (2) credited towards the minimum number of days that
31 a pupil must be in attendance to obtain credit or be promoted to the next higher grade, if the
32 pupil has completed course-work requirements. (NRS 392.122, 392.130) Section 6 of this bill
33 provides that a pupil is not a truant if the pupil is absent from school: (1) for the bereavement
34 of the death of an immediate family member; (2) because the pupil is experiencing distress
35 relating to bullying; or (3) for certain other mental or behavioral health reasons. Section 6
36 requires the parent or legal guardian or other person having control or charge of a pupil who is
37 absent from school for those reasons to notify the teacher or principal of the school within 3
38 days after the absence. Section 6 then deems those absences as approved, except that only a
39 certain amount of absences for each reason may be approved within 1 school year. Section 5
40 of this bill requires those days on which the pupil was absent under those circumstances to be
41 credited towards the minimum number of days that the pupil must be in attendance to obtain
42 credit or be promoted to the next higher grade, if the pupil has completed course-work
43 requirements. Section 4 of this bill provides that an absence that is approved under those
44 circumstances is not considered an absence that a school is required to indicate on a report
45 card issued to a pupil.
46 Section 5 prohibits the denial of credit to a pupil or the promotion of a pupil to the next
47 higher grade because the pupil did not attend school for the minimum number of days
48 required if: (1) the pupil has earned at least a weighted 3.0 grade point average, on a 4.0
49 grading scale, for the school year; and (2) the absences, without which would otherwise allow
50 the pupil to receive credit or be promoted to the next grade, were caused by or relate to
51 bullying or physical, mental or behavioral health.]
52 Existing law: (1) regulates the practice and requires the licensure of certain mental health
53 professionals, including psychiatrists, psychologists, marriage and family therapists, clinical
54 professional counselors, registered nurses, social workers, alcohol and drug counselors and
55 problem gambling counselors; and (2) prohibits unlicensed persons from engaging in the
56 practices of those professions. (Chapters 630, 632, 633 and 641-641C of NRS) Section 7 of
57 this bill prohibits, with certain exceptions, an artificial intelligence provider from offering to
58 users in this State an artificial intelligence system that is specifically programmed to provide a
59 user with a service or an experience that would constitute the practice of professional mental
60 or behavioral health care if provided by a natural person. Section 7 also prohibits, with certain
61 exceptions, an artificial intelligence provider or a natural person who is not licensed to
62 practice professional mental or behavioral health care from making certain representations
63 that would lead a person to believe that the provider, the artificial intelligence system operated
64 by the provider or the natural person is capable of or qualified to provide mental or behavioral
65 health care. Section 8 of this bill imposes certain restrictions and prohibitions on the use of an
66 artificial intelligence system by a licensed provider of mental and behavioral health care.

31 absences, if any, for the period covered by the report card or other report of
32 progress.
33 2. An absence [for the observance of a religious holiday] which is approved
34 pursuant to [subsection 6 of] NRS 392.130 must not be counted as an absence for
35 the purposes of this section.] (Deleted by amendment.)
36 Sec. 5. [NRS 392.122 is hereby amended to read as follows:
37 392.122 1. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 389.320, the board of
38 trustees of each school district shall prescribe a minimum number of days that a
39 pupil who is subject to compulsory enrollment and attendance and enrolled in a
40 school in the district must be in attendance for the pupil to obtain credit or to be
41 promoted to the next higher grade. The board of trustees of a school district may
42 adopt a policy prescribing:

44 first grade in the school district must be in attendance for the pupil to obtain credit
45 or to be promoted to the next higher grade.
46 (b) The circumstances under which a pupil will be considered chronically
47 absent by the Department.
48 2. Before a pupil is denied credit or promotion to the next higher grade for
49 failure to comply with the attendance requirements prescribed pursuant to
50 subsection 1, the principal of the school in which the pupil is enrolled or the
51 principal’s designee shall provide written notice of the intended denial to the parent
52 or legal guardian of the pupil. The notice must include a statement indicating that
53 the pupil and the pupil’s parent or legal guardian may request a review of the

2 Upon the request for a review by the pupil and the pupil’s parent or legal guardian,
3 the parent or legal guardian may present the principal or the principal’s designee
4 with documentation that the pupil has complied with the attendance requirements
5 prescribed pursuant to subsection 1 by attending school, either in person or through
6 an alternative program of education or a program of distance education approved by
7 the Department. If the documentation is accurate and the principal or principal’s
8 designee finds that any absence of the pupil was entered in error, the error must be

10 determining whether the pupil may obtain credit or be promoted to the next higher

19 grading scale, or the equivalent of a weighted 3.0 grade point average on a
20 grading scale approved by the Superintendent of Public Instruction if a different
21 grading scale is used, for the school year during which the pupil failed to comply
22 with the attendance requirements prescribed pursuant to subsection 1;
23 (b) The pupil or the legal guardian or other person having control or charge
24 of the pupil represents that one or more of the absences of the pupil were caused
25 by or related to:
26 (1) Distress caused by bullying at school;
27 (2) The mental or behavioral health of the pupil; or
28 (3) A physical or mental condition of the pupil; and
29 (c) The number of days that the pupil was absent from school, excluding the
30 number of absences described in paragraph (b), are insufficient to deny the pupil
31 credit or promotion to the next higher grade for the failure to comply with the
32 attendance requirements prescribed pursuant to subsection 1.
33 5. For the purposes of this section, the days on which a pupil is not in
34 attendance because the pupil is absent for [the observance of a religious holiday] a
35 reason described in subsections 6 to 9, inclusive, of NRS 392.130 must be credited
36 towards the required days of attendance if the absence was approved pursuant to
37 [subsection 6 of] NRS 392.130 and the pupil has completed course-work

48 or the principal of the school, unless the pupil is [physically or mentally unable to
49 attend school or is absent from school for the observance of a religious holiday.]
50 absent for the reasons described in subsections 5 to 9, inclusive, and the absence
51 is deemed an excused or approved absence.
52 2. Upon the request of a parent or legal guardian of a pupil, made during the

27 days before the pupil will be absent from school. An absence for which notice is
28 provided in accordance with this subsection shall be deemed an approved absence,
29 except that not more than 5 absences within 1 school year may be approved
30 pursuant to this subsection.

34 pupil shall notify the teacher or principal of the school in writing, in accordance
35 with the policy established by the board of trustees of the school district, within 3
36 days after the pupil returns to school. An absence for which notice is provided in

45 distress due to bullying at school that has occurred within the 30 days
46 immediately preceding the absence and the pupil has reported the bullying to the
47 teacher or principal of the school, the parent or legal guardian or other person
48 having control or charge of the pupil shall notify the teacher or principal of the
49 school in writing, in accordance with the policy established by the board of
50 trustees of the school district, within 3 days after the pupil returns to school. An

52 deemed an approved absence, except that not more than 5 absences within 1
53 school year may be approved pursuant to this subsection.
Assembly Amendment No. 389 to Assembly Bill No. 406 Page 9
1 9. If a pupil is absent from school because the pupil is obtaining treatment
2 or otherwise requires relief for a reason related to his or her mental or behavioral
3 health, the parent or legal guardian or other person having control or charge of
4 the pupil shall notify the teacher or principal of the school in writing, in

FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.

[CONTAINS UNFUNDED MANDATE (§ 1)
(NOT REQUESTED BY AFFECTED LOCAL GOVERNMENT)]
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health; [requiring a public school to provide certain
information relating to mental health to pupils;] prohibiting certain
uses of artificial intelligence in public schools; [requiring that a pupil
be allowed credit or promotion to the next higher grade despite
absences from school in certain circumstances; deeming certain
absences from school to be approved absences;] imposing certain
restrictions relating to the marketing and programming of artificial
intelligence systems; prohibiting certain persons from representing
themselves as qualified to provide mental or behavioral health care;
imposing certain restrictions relating to the use of artificial intelligence
by providers of mental or behavioral health care; providing civil
penalties; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 [Existing law requires the board of trustees of a school district or governing body of a
2 charter school to ensure that information relating to mental health resources appears on the
3 back of any identification card issued to a pupil at a school within the school district or the
4 charter school. (NRS 388.1335) Section 1 of this bill requires each public school to publish on
5 an Internet website maintained by the school and to provide at the school information relating
6 to mental health and certain resources for caring for the mental health of pupils. Section 1 also
7 requires each public school to conduct a live assembly at least once every 3 months during the
8 school year for the pupils of the school to provide education and information relating to
9 mental health.]
10 Existing law prescribes the authority and duties of a school counselor, school
11 psychologist and school social worker. (NRS 391.293, 391.294, 391.296) Section 2 of this bill
12 prohibits a public school from using artificial intelligence to perform the functions and duties
13 of a school counselor, school psychologist or school social worker which relate to the mental
14 health of pupils.
15 [Existing law, in general, requires a child between 6 and 18 years of age to attend public
16 school. (NRS 392.040) Existing law requires the board of trustees of a school district to
17 prescribe a minimum number of days that a pupil must be in attendance for the pupil to obtain

Assembly Amendment No. 389 to Assembly Bill No. 406 Page 4
18 credit or be promoted to the next higher grade. (NRS 392.122) Existing law excuses a child
19 from those attendance requirements when satisfactory written evidence, including a certificate
20 from certain providers of health care, is presented to the board of trustees of the school district
21 in which the child resides that the child’s physical or mental condition or behavioral health is
22 such as to prevent or render inadvisable the child’s attendance at school or his or her
23 application to study. (NRS 392.050) Section 3 of this bill additionally excuses a child from
24 attendance for the dates immediately preceding and immediately following any date or dates
25 to which a certificate from a provider of health care applies.
26 Existing law deems as a truant a pupil who is absent from school without the approval of
27 a teacher or principal of the school, unless the pupil is absent: (1) because the pupil is
28 physically or mentally unable to attend school; or (2) for the observance of a religious holiday.
29 (NRS 391.130) A day on which a pupil is absent for those reasons must be: (1) deemed as
30 approved, with certain exceptions; and (2) credited towards the minimum number of days that
31 a pupil must be in attendance to obtain credit or be promoted to the next higher grade, if the
32 pupil has completed course-work requirements. (NRS 392.122, 392.130) Section 6 of this bill
33 provides that a pupil is not a truant if the pupil is absent from school: (1) for the bereavement
34 of the death of an immediate family member; (2) because the pupil is experiencing distress
35 relating to bullying; or (3) for certain other mental or behavioral health reasons. Section 6
36 requires the parent or legal guardian or other person having control or charge of a pupil who is
37 absent from school for those reasons to notify the teacher or principal of the school within 3
38 days after the absence. Section 6 then deems those absences as approved, except that only a
39 certain amount of absences for each reason may be approved within 1 school year. Section 5
40 of this bill requires those days on which the pupil was absent under those circumstances to be
41 credited towards the minimum number of days that the pupil must be in attendance to obtain
42 credit or be promoted to the next higher grade, if the pupil has completed course-work
43 requirements. Section 4 of this bill provides that an absence that is approved under those
44 circumstances is not considered an absence that a school is required to indicate on a report
45 card issued to a pupil.
46 Section 5 prohibits the denial of credit to a pupil or the promotion of a pupil to the next
47 higher grade because the pupil did not attend school for the minimum number of days
48 required if: (1) the pupil has earned at least a weighted 3.0 grade point average, on a 4.0
49 grading scale, for the school year; and (2) the absences, without which would otherwise allow
50 the pupil to receive credit or be promoted to the next grade, were caused by or relate to
51 bullying or physical, mental or behavioral health.]
52 Existing law: (1) regulates the practice and requires the licensure of certain mental health
53 professionals, including psychiatrists, psychologists, marriage and family therapists, clinical
54 professional counselors, registered nurses, social workers, alcohol and drug counselors and
55 problem gambling counselors; and (2) prohibits unlicensed persons from engaging in the
56 practices of those professions. (Chapters 630, 632, 633 and 641-641C of NRS) Section 7 of
57 this bill prohibits, with certain exceptions, an artificial intelligence provider from offering to
58 users in this State an artificial intelligence system that is specifically programmed to provide a
59 user with a service or an experience that would constitute the practice of professional mental
60 or behavioral health care if provided by a natural person. Section 7 also prohibits, with certain
61 exceptions, an artificial intelligence provider or a natural person who is not licensed to
62 practice professional mental or behavioral health care from making certain representations
63 that would lead a person to believe that the provider, the artificial intelligence system operated
64 by the provider or the natural person is capable of or qualified to provide mental or behavioral
65 health care. Section 8 of this bill imposes certain restrictions and prohibitions on the use of an
66 artificial intelligence system by a licensed provider of mental and behavioral health care.

4 with documentation that the pupil has complied with the attendance requirements
5 prescribed pursuant to subsection 1 by attending school, either in person or through

24 of the pupil represents that one or more of the absences of the pupil were caused
25 by or related to:
26 (1) Distress caused by bullying at school;
27 (2) The mental or behavioral health of the pupil; or
28 (3) A physical or mental condition of the pupil; and
29 (c) The number of days that the pupil was absent from school, excluding the
30 number of absences described in paragraph (b), are insufficient to deny the pupil

34 attendance because the pupil is absent for [the observance of a religious holiday] a

53 school year may be approved pursuant to this subsection.

Assembly Amendment No. 389 to Assembly Bill No. 406 Page 9
1 9. If a pupil is absent from school because the pupil is obtaining treatment
2 or otherwise requires relief for a reason related to his or her mental or behavioral
3 health, the parent or legal guardian or other person having control or charge of
4 the pupil shall notify the teacher or principal of the school in writing, in
