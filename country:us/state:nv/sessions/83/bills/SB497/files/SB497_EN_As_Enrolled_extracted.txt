Section 1:
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to Medicaid; eliminating the requirement that the
Director of the Department of Health and Human Services
biennially establish rates of reimbursement for certain
applied behavioral analysis services that are comparable to
rates of reimbursement paid for those services by Medicaid
programs in other states; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law requires the Director of the Department of Health and Human
Services to include under Medicaid coverage for services provided by behavior
analysts, assistant behavior analysts and registered behavior technicians to
recipients of Medicaid who are less than 27 years of age. Existing law requires the
Director to biennially establish rates of reimbursement under Medicaid for such
services that are provided on a fee-for-service basis, which must be comparable to
rates of reimbursement paid by Medicaid programs in other states for those
services. (NRS 422.27497) This bill eliminates this requirement, thereby requiring
Medicaid to establish the rates of reimbursement for these services in the same
manner as the rates of reimbursement for other services provided to recipients of
Medicaid.
