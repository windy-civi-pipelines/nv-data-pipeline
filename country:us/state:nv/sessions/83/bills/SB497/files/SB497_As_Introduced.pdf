EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to Medicaid; eliminating the requirement that the
Director of the Department of Health and Human Services
biennially establish rates of reimbursement for certain
applied behavioral analysis services that are comparable
to rates of reimbursement paid for those services by
Medicaid programs in other states; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Director of the Department of Health and Human
2 Services to include under Medicaid coverage for services provided by behavior
3 analysts, assistant behavior analysts and registered behavior technicians to
4 recipients of Medicaid who are less than 27 years of age. Existing law requires the
5 Director to biennially establish rates of reimbursement under Medicaid for such
6 services that are provided on a fee-for-service basis, which must be comparable to
7 rates of reimbursement paid by Medicaid programs in other states for those
8 services. (NRS 422.27497) This bill eliminates this requirement, thereby requiring
9 Medicaid to establish the rates of reimbursement for these services in the same
10 manner as the rates of reimbursement for other services provided to recipients of
11 Medicaid.
