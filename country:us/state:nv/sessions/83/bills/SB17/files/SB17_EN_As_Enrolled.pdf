Senate Bill No. 17–Committee on Judiciary
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to criminal procedure; revising the eligibility for
defendants charged with certain crimes to complete a
preprosecution diversion program; revising certain provisions
relating to programs for treatment of alcohol or other
substance use disorders; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law establishes a preprosecution diversion program for certain persons
who have been accused of committing certain crimes which are punishable as a
misdemeanor. (NRS 174.031) Section 1 of this bill revises the list of persons
eligible for such a diversion program to exclude persons who have: (1) been
charged with certain misdemeanors; and (2) previously been convicted of or
determined to have committed certain criminal offenses.
Existing law establishes a program for the treatment of alcohol or other
substance use disorders to which a court may assign certain persons. The program
is modeled after the provisions of law governing the programs for the treatment of
mental illness and intellectual disabilities and for the treatment of veterans and
members of the military. (NRS 176A.230) Sections 2-4 of this bill clarify that a
district court, justice court or municipal court each has the authority to establish a
program for the treatment of alcohol or other substance use disorders. Section 3
also authorizes a court to provisionally refer a defendant to a program for the
treatment of alcohol or other substance use disorders, pending the outcome of a
clinical assessment or substance use assessment.
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.

recommendation to the court concerning the length and type of
treatment required for the defendant.
4. If the offense committed by the defendant is a category A

section or for purposes of employment, civil rights or any statute or
regulation or license or questionnaire or for any other public or
private purpose, but is a conviction for the purpose of additional
penalties imposed for second or subsequent convictions or the
setting of bail. Discharge and dismissal restores the defendant, in the
contemplation of the law, to the status occupied before the arrest,
indictment or information. The defendant may not be held thereafter
under any law to be guilty of perjury or otherwise giving a false
statement by reason of failure to recite or acknowledge that arrest,
indictment, information or trial in response to an inquiry made of
the defendant for any purpose.
8. If the defendant was charged with a violation of NRS

applicable, may conditionally dismiss the charges or set aside the
judgment of conviction, as applicable. If a court conditionally
dismisses the charges or sets aside the judgment of conviction, the
court shall notify the defendant that any conditionally dismissed
charge or judgment of conviction that is set aside is a conviction for
the purpose of additional penalties imposed for second or
subsequent convictions or the setting of bail in a future case, but is
not a conviction for purposes of employment, civil rights or any
statute or regulation or license or questionnaire or for any other
public or private purpose. Conditional dismissal or having a
judgment of conviction set aside restores the defendant, in the
contemplation of the law, to the status occupied before the arrest,
complaint, indictment or information. The defendant may not be
held thereafter under any law to be guilty of perjury or otherwise
giving a false statement by reason of failure to recite or
acknowledge that arrest, complaint, indictment, information or trial
in response to an inquiry made of the defendant for any purpose.
Sec. 4. NRS 176A.245 is hereby amended to read as follows:
176A.245 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2,
after a defendant is discharged from probation or a case is dismissed
pursuant to NRS 176A.240, [the] a justice court, municipal court
or district court shall order sealed all documents, papers and
exhibits in the defendant’s record, minute book entries and entries
on dockets, and other documents relating to the case in the custody
of such other agencies and officers as are named in the court’s order
if the defendant fulfills the terms and conditions imposed by the
court and the Division. The court shall order those records sealed
without a hearing unless the Division petitions the court, for good
cause shown, not to seal the records and requests a hearing thereon.

176A.240, not sooner than 7 years after the charges are

municipal court or district court, as applicable, shall order that all
documents, papers and exhibits in the defendant’s record, minute
book entries and entries on dockets, and other documents relating to
the case in the custody of such other agencies and officers as are
named in the court’s order be sealed. The justice court, municipal
court or district court, as applicable, shall order those records sealed
without a hearing unless the Division petitions the court, for good
cause shown, not to seal the records and requests a hearing thereon.
3. If the justice court, municipal court or district court orders
sealed the record of a defendant who is discharged from probation,
whose case is dismissed, whose charges were conditionally
dismissed or whose judgment of conviction was set aside pursuant
to NRS 176A.240, the court shall send a copy of the order to each
