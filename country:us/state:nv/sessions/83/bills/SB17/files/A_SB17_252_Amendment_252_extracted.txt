27 or subsequent convictions or the setting of bail in a future case, but is not a
28 conviction for purposes of employment, civil rights or any statute or regulation or
29 license or questionnaire or for any other public or private purpose. Conditional
30 dismissal or having a judgment of conviction set aside restores the defendant, in the
31 contemplation of the law, to the status occupied before the arrest, complaint,
32 indictment or information. The defendant may not be held thereafter under any law
33 to be guilty of perjury or otherwise giving a false statement by reason of failure to
34 recite or acknowledge that arrest, complaint, indictment, information or trial in
35 response to an inquiry made of the defendant for any purpose.
36 Sec. 4. NRS 176A.245 is hereby amended to read as follows:

42 other agencies and officers as are named in the court’s order if the defendant fulfills
43 the terms and conditions imposed by the court and the Division. The court shall

46 2. If the defendant is charged with a violation of NRS 200.485, 484C.110 or
47 484C.210 and the charges are conditionally dismissed or the judgment of

51 or district court, as applicable, shall order that all documents, papers and exhibits in
52 the defendant’s record, minute book entries and entries on dockets, and other
53 documents relating to the case in the custody of such other agencies and officers as

1 are named in the court’s order be sealed. The justice court, municipal court or
2 district court, as applicable, shall order those records sealed without a hearing
3 unless the Division petitions the court, for good cause shown, not to seal the records
4 and requests a hearing thereon.
5 3. If the justice court, municipal court or district court orders sealed the
6 record of a defendant who is discharged from probation, whose case is dismissed,

26 participation in a program established pursuant to NRS 176A.230 if [the] :
27 (a) The defendant is diagnosed as having a substance use disorder or any co-
28 occurring disorder:
29 [(a)] (1) After an in-person clinical assessment by:
30 [(1)] (I) A counselor who is licensed or certified to make such a diagnosis;
31 or
32 [(2)] (II) A duly licensed physician qualified by the Board of Medical
33 Examiners to make such a diagnosis; or
34 [(b)] (2) Pursuant to a substance use assessment [.] ; or
35 (b) The court, upon its discretion, provisionally refers a defendant for
36 participation in such a program pending the outcome of the assessment
37 conducted pursuant to subparagraph (1) or (2) of paragraph (a).
38 3. A counselor or physician who diagnoses a defendant as having a substance
39 use disorder shall submit a report and recommendation to the court concerning the
40 length and type of treatment required for the defendant.
41 4. If the offense committed by the defendant is a category A felony or a
42 sexual offense as defined in NRS 179D.097 that is punishable as a category B
43 felony, the defendant is not eligible for assignment to the program.
44 5. Upon violation of a term or condition:
45 (a) The court may enter a judgment of conviction, if applicable, and proceed as
46 provided in the section pursuant to which the defendant was charged.
47 (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (e) of subsection 2 of NRS
48 193.130, the court may order the defendant to the custody of the Department of
49 Corrections if the offense is punishable by imprisonment in the state prison.
50 6. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 8, upon fulfillment of the terms
51 and conditions, the court:
52 (a) Shall discharge the defendant and dismiss the proceedings or set aside the
53 judgment of conviction, as applicable, unless the defendant:

Senate Amendment No. 252 to Senate Bill No. 17 Page 6
1 (1) Has been previously convicted in this State or in any other jurisdiction
2 of a felony; or
3 (2) Has previously failed to complete a specialty court program; or
4 (b) May discharge the defendant and dismiss the proceedings or set aside the
5 judgment of conviction, as applicable, if the defendant:
6 (1) Has been previously convicted in this State or in any other jurisdiction
7 of a felony; or
8 (2) Has previously failed to complete a specialty court program.
9 7. Discharge and dismissal pursuant to this section is without adjudication of
10 guilt and is not a conviction for purposes of this section or for purposes of
11 employment, civil rights or any statute or regulation or license or questionnaire or
12 for any other public or private purpose, but is a conviction for the purpose of
13 additional penalties imposed for second or subsequent convictions or the setting of
14 bail. Discharge and dismissal restores the defendant, in the contemplation of the
15 law, to the status occupied before the arrest, indictment or information. The
16 defendant may not be held thereafter under any law to be guilty of perjury or
17 otherwise giving a false statement by reason of failure to recite or acknowledge that
18 arrest, indictment, information or trial in response to an inquiry made of the
19 defendant for any purpose.
20 8. If the defendant was charged with a violation of NRS 200.485, 484C.110
21 or 484C.120, upon fulfillment of the terms and conditions, the district court, justice
22 court or municipal court, as applicable, may conditionally dismiss the charges or set
23 aside the judgment of conviction, as applicable. If a court conditionally dismisses
24 the charges or sets aside the judgment of conviction, the court shall notify the
25 defendant that any conditionally dismissed charge or judgment of conviction that is
26 set aside is a conviction for the purpose of additional penalties imposed for second
27 or subsequent convictions or the setting of bail in a future case, but is not a
28 conviction for purposes of employment, civil rights or any statute or regulation or
29 license or questionnaire or for any other public or private purpose. Conditional
30 dismissal or having a judgment of conviction set aside restores the defendant, in the
31 contemplation of the law, to the status occupied before the arrest, complaint,
32 indictment or information. The defendant may not be held thereafter under any law
33 to be guilty of perjury or otherwise giving a false statement by reason of failure to
34 recite or acknowledge that arrest, complaint, indictment, information or trial in
35 response to an inquiry made of the defendant for any purpose.
36 Sec. 4. NRS 176A.245 is hereby amended to read as follows:
37 176A.245 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2, after a defendant
38 is discharged from probation or a case is dismissed pursuant to NRS 176A.240,
39 [the] a justice court, municipal court or district court shall order sealed all
40 documents, papers and exhibits in the defendant’s record, minute book entries and
41 entries on dockets, and other documents relating to the case in the custody of such
42 other agencies and officers as are named in the court’s order if the defendant fulfills
43 the terms and conditions imposed by the court and the Division. The court shall
44 order those records sealed without a hearing unless the Division petitions the court,
45 for good cause shown, not to seal the records and requests a hearing thereon.
46 2. If the defendant is charged with a violation of NRS 200.485, 484C.110 or
47 484C.210 and the charges are conditionally dismissed or the judgment of
48 conviction is set aside as provided in NRS 176A.240, not sooner than 7 years after
49 the charges are conditionally dismissed or the judgment of conviction is set aside
50 and upon the filing of a petition by the defendant, the justice court, municipal court
51 or district court, as applicable, shall order that all documents, papers and exhibits in
52 the defendant’s record, minute book entries and entries on dockets, and other
53 documents relating to the case in the custody of such other agencies and officers as

Senate Amendment No. 252 to Senate Bill No. 17 Page 7
1 are named in the court’s order be sealed. The justice court, municipal court or
2 district court, as applicable, shall order those records sealed without a hearing
3 unless the Division petitions the court, for good cause shown, not to seal the records
4 and requests a hearing thereon.
5 3. If the justice court, municipal court or district court orders sealed the
6 record of a defendant who is discharged from probation, whose case is dismissed,
7 whose charges were conditionally dismissed or whose judgment of conviction was
8 set aside pursuant to NRS 176A.240, the court shall send a copy of the order to
9 each agency or officer named in the order. Each such agency or officer shall notify
10 the court in writing of its compliance with the order.
11 Sec. 5. This act becomes effective upon passage and approval.
