EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to criminal procedure; revising the eligibility for
defendants charged with certain crimes to complete a
preprosecution diversion program; revising certain
provisions relating to programs for treatment of alcohol or
other substance use disorders; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes a preprosecution diversion program for certain persons
2 who have been accused of committing certain crimes which are punishable as a
3 misdemeanor. (NRS 174.031) Section 1 of this bill expands the list of persons
4 eligible for such a diversion program, to include persons who have previously: (1)
5 been convicted, with the exception of certain criminal offenses; or (2) completed a
6 preprosecution diversion program in this State.
7 Existing law establishes a program for the treatment of alcohol or other
8 substance use disorders to which a court may assign certain persons. The program
9 is modeled after the provisions of law governing the programs for the treatment of
10 mental illness and intellectual disabilities and for the treatment of veterans and
11 members of the military. (NRS 176A.230) Sections 2-4 of this bill clarify that a
12 district court, justice court or municipal court each has the authority to establish a
13 program for the treatment of alcohol or other substance use disorders. Section 3
14 also authorizes a court to provisionally refer a defendant to a program for the
15 treatment of alcohol or other substance use disorders, pending the outcome of a
16 clinical assessment or substance use assessment.

10 subsequent convictions or the setting of bail in a future case, but is
11 not a conviction for purposes of employment, civil rights or any
12 statute or regulation or license or questionnaire or for any other
13 public or private purpose. Conditional dismissal or having a
14 judgment of conviction set aside restores the defendant, in the
15 contemplation of the law, to the status occupied before the arrest,
16 complaint, indictment or information. The defendant may not be
17 held thereafter under any law to be guilty of perjury or otherwise
18 giving a false statement by reason of failure to recite or

28 of such other agencies and officers as are named in the court’s order
29 if the defendant fulfills the terms and conditions imposed by the

40 documents, papers and exhibits in the defendant’s record, minute
