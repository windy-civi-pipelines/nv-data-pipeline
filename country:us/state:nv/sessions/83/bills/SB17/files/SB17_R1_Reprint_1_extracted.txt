EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to criminal procedure; revising the eligibility for
defendants charged with certain crimes to complete a
preprosecution diversion program; revising certain
provisions relating to programs for treatment of alcohol or

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes a preprosecution diversion program for certain persons
2 who have been accused of committing certain crimes which are punishable as a
3 misdemeanor. (NRS 174.031) Section 1 of this bill revises the list of persons
4 eligible for such a diversion program to exclude persons who have: (1) been
5 charged with certain misdemeanors; and (2) previously been convicted of or
6 determined to have committed certain criminal offenses.
7 Existing law establishes a program for the treatment of alcohol or other
8 substance use disorders to which a court may assign certain persons. The program
9 is modeled after the provisions of law governing the programs for the treatment of
10 mental illness and intellectual disabilities and for the treatment of veterans and
11 members of the military. (NRS 176A.230) Sections 2-4 of this bill clarify that a
12 district court, justice court or municipal court each has the authority to establish a
13 program for the treatment of alcohol or other substance use disorders. Section 3
14 also authorizes a court to provisionally refer a defendant to a program for the
15 treatment of alcohol or other substance use disorders, pending the outcome of a
16 clinical assessment or substance use assessment.

31 subsequent convictions or the setting of bail in a future case, but is
32 not a conviction for purposes of employment, civil rights or any
33 statute or regulation or license or questionnaire or for any other
34 public or private purpose. Conditional dismissal or having a
35 judgment of conviction set aside restores the defendant, in the
36 contemplation of the law, to the status occupied before the arrest,
37 complaint, indictment or information. The defendant may not be
38 held thereafter under any law to be guilty of perjury or otherwise
39 giving a false statement by reason of failure to recite or

8 cause shown, not to seal the records and requests a hearing thereon.
9 2. If the defendant is charged with a violation of NRS 200.485,
10 484C.110 or 484C.120 and the charges are conditionally dismissed
11 or the judgment of conviction is set aside as provided in NRS

14 and upon the filing of a petition by the defendant, the justice court,
15 municipal court or district court, as applicable, shall order that all
16 documents, papers and exhibits in the defendant’s record, minute
17 book entries and entries on dockets, and other documents relating to
18 the case in the custody of such other agencies and officers as are
19 named in the court’s order be sealed. The justice court, municipal
20 court or district court, as applicable, shall order those records sealed
21 without a hearing unless the Division petitions the court, for good
22 cause shown, not to seal the records and requests a hearing thereon.
23 3. If the justice court, municipal court or district court orders

36 subsection 2 of NRS 193.130, the court may order the defendant to
37 the custody of the Department of Corrections if the offense is
38 punishable by imprisonment in the state prison.
39 6. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 8, upon
40 fulfillment of the terms and conditions, the court:
41 (a) Shall discharge the defendant and dismiss the proceedings or
42 set aside the judgment of conviction, as applicable, unless the
43 defendant:
44 (1) Has been previously convicted in this State or in any
45 other jurisdiction of a felony; or
-
*SB17_R1*

– 5 –
1 (2) Has previously failed to complete a specialty court
2 program; or
3 (b) May discharge the defendant and dismiss the proceedings or
4 set aside the judgment of conviction, as applicable, if the defendant:
5 (1) Has been previously convicted in this State or in any
6 other jurisdiction of a felony; or
7 (2) Has previously failed to complete a specialty court
8 program.
9 7. Discharge and dismissal pursuant to this section is without
10 adjudication of guilt and is not a conviction for purposes of this
11 section or for purposes of employment, civil rights or any statute or
12 regulation or license or questionnaire or for any other public or
13 private purpose, but is a conviction for the purpose of additional
14 penalties imposed for second or subsequent convictions or the
15 setting of bail. Discharge and dismissal restores the defendant, in the
16 contemplation of the law, to the status occupied before the arrest,
17 indictment or information. The defendant may not be held thereafter
18 under any law to be guilty of perjury or otherwise giving a false
19 statement by reason of failure to recite or acknowledge that arrest,
20 indictment, information or trial in response to an inquiry made of
21 the defendant for any purpose.
22 8. If the defendant was charged with a violation of NRS
23 200.485, 484C.110 or 484C.120, upon fulfillment of the terms and
24 conditions, the district court, justice court or municipal court, as
25 applicable, may conditionally dismiss the charges or set aside the
26 judgment of conviction, as applicable. If a court conditionally
27 dismisses the charges or sets aside the judgment of conviction, the
28 court shall notify the defendant that any conditionally dismissed
29 charge or judgment of conviction that is set aside is a conviction for
30 the purpose of additional penalties imposed for second or
31 subsequent convictions or the setting of bail in a future case, but is
32 not a conviction for purposes of employment, civil rights or any
33 statute or regulation or license or questionnaire or for any other
34 public or private purpose. Conditional dismissal or having a
35 judgment of conviction set aside restores the defendant, in the
36 contemplation of the law, to the status occupied before the arrest,
37 complaint, indictment or information. The defendant may not be
38 held thereafter under any law to be guilty of perjury or otherwise
39 giving a false statement by reason of failure to recite or
40 acknowledge that arrest, complaint, indictment, information or trial
41 in response to an inquiry made of the defendant for any purpose.
42 Sec. 4. NRS 176A.245 is hereby amended to read as follows:
43 176A.245 1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2,
44 after a defendant is discharged from probation or a case is dismissed
45 pursuant to NRS 176A.240, [the] a justice court, municipal court
-
*SB17_R1*

– 6 –
1 or district court shall order sealed all documents, papers and
2 exhibits in the defendant’s record, minute book entries and entries
3 on dockets, and other documents relating to the case in the custody
4 of such other agencies and officers as are named in the court’s order
5 if the defendant fulfills the terms and conditions imposed by the
6 court and the Division. The court shall order those records sealed
7 without a hearing unless the Division petitions the court, for good
8 cause shown, not to seal the records and requests a hearing thereon.
9 2. If the defendant is charged with a violation of NRS 200.485,
10 484C.110 or 484C.120 and the charges are conditionally dismissed
11 or the judgment of conviction is set aside as provided in NRS
12 176A.240, not sooner than 7 years after the charges are
13 conditionally dismissed or the judgment of conviction is set aside
14 and upon the filing of a petition by the defendant, the justice court,
15 municipal court or district court, as applicable, shall order that all
16 documents, papers and exhibits in the defendant’s record, minute
17 book entries and entries on dockets, and other documents relating to
18 the case in the custody of such other agencies and officers as are
19 named in the court’s order be sealed. The justice court, municipal
20 court or district court, as applicable, shall order those records sealed
21 without a hearing unless the Division petitions the court, for good
22 cause shown, not to seal the records and requests a hearing thereon.
23 3. If the justice court, municipal court or district court orders
24 sealed the record of a defendant who is discharged from probation,
25 whose case is dismissed, whose charges were conditionally
26 dismissed or whose judgment of conviction was set aside pursuant
27 to NRS 176A.240, the court shall send a copy of the order to each
28 agency or officer named in the order. Each such agency or officer
29 shall notify the court in writing of its compliance with the order.
30 Sec. 5. This act becomes effective upon passage and approval.
