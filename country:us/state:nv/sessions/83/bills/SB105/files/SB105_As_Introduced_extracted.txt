SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to Medicare
supplemental policies. (BDR 57-71)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: No.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to insurance; requiring insurers to make available
to certain persons all Medicare supplemental policies sold
by the insurer that can be purchased by the person;
prohibiting an insurer from treating Medicare
supplemental policies that are classified as guaranteed
issue differently for certain purposes relating to the
payment of commissions; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing federal law establishes the Medicare program, which is a public health
2 insurance program for persons 65 years of age and older and specified persons with
3 disabilities who are under 65 years of age. (42 U.S.C. §§ 1395 et seq.) Under
4 existing federal regulations, a “Medicare supplemental policy” is a policy offered
5 by a private insurer that is primarily designed to pay expenses not reimbursed under
6 Medicare because of certain limitations under Medicare. (42 C.F.R. § 403.205)
7 Existing federal law classifies Medicare supplemental policies based on the
8 standardized package of benefits, which are prescribed by federal law, that each
9 policy offers. Existing federal law also requires the issuance of a Medicare
10 supplemental policy under certain circumstances, under which such a policy is
11 considered to be guaranteed issue, but does not require all of the standardized
12 benefit plans to be made available for guaranteed issue, with certain exceptions. (42
13 U.S.C. § 1395ss) This bill requires insurers that offer Medicare supplemental
14 policies in this State to allow a person who is purchasing a Medicare supplemental
15 policy where guaranteed issue requirements apply to purchase any standardized
16 benefit plan that: (1) the insurer sells to new applicants in this State; and (2) the
17 insurer is authorized under federal law to sell to the person.
18 Under certain circumstances, existing law prohibits an insurer or other person
19 or entity from varying the commission associated with the purchase of certain
20 Medicare supplemental policies, paying differential commissions associated with
-

– 2 –
21 the purchase of those Medicare supplemental policies or otherwise treating those
22 particular Medicare supplemental policies differently for the purposes of
23 commission. (NRS 687B.352) This bill applies this prohibition to the purchase of a
24 Medicare supplemental policy that is classified as guaranteed issue.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. Chapter 687B of NRS is hereby amended by adding
2 thereto a new section to read as follows:
3 1. An insurer that offers any Medicare supplemental policy
4 for delivery in this State shall allow a person who is eligible to
5 purchase a Medicare supplemental policy classified as guaranteed
6 issue under 42 U.S.C. § 1395ss or any other applicable federal or
7 state law or regulations to purchase any standardized benefit plan
8 offered by the insurer which is available for issuance to new
9 insureds. For purposes of this subsection only, a policy that is
10 issued solely pursuant to NRS 687B.352 is not classified as
11 guaranteed issue.
12 2. The provisions of subsection 1 must not be construed to
13 require an insurer to sell or issue any policy where prohibited by
14 federal law.
15 3. An insurer or other person or entity shall not vary the
16 commission associated with the purchase of a Medicare
17 supplemental policy, pay differential commissions associated with
18 the purchase of a Medicare supplemental policy or otherwise treat
19 a Medicare supplemental policy differently for the purposes of
20 commission because the policy is classified as guaranteed issue
21 under 42 U.S.C. § 1395ss or any other applicable federal or state
22 law or regulations.
23 4. As used in this section:
24 (a) “Medicare supplemental policy” has the meaning ascribed
25 to it in 42 C.F.R. § 403.205.
26 (b) “Standardized benefit plan”:
27 (1) Means a Medicare supplemental policy with a
28 particular package of benefits as required by federal law; and
29 (2) Includes, without limitation, any Medicare
30 supplemental policy designated as Standardized Benefit Plan A to
31 N, inclusive, any high deductible version of any such plan and any
32 other standardized package of benefits for Medicare supplemental
33 policies that may be established by federal law.
34 Sec. 2. NRS 695B.320 is hereby amended to read as follows:
35 695B.320 1. Nonprofit hospital and medical or dental service
36 corporations are subject to the provisions of this chapter, and to the
37 provisions of chapters 679A and 679B of NRS, subsections 2, 4, 17,
