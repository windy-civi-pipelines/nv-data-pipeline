EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to taxation; revising the pupils on whose behalf a
scholarship organization is authorized to provide a grant
under the Nevada Education Choice Scholarship Program;
requiring a scholarship organization to notify the
Department of Taxation if there are no pupils on whose
behalf the scholarship organization is authorized to
provide a grant; prohibiting the Department from
approving applications for tax credits under the Program
made by such a scholarship organization; requiring a
scholarship organization to repay certain tax credits under
certain circumstances; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, financial institutions, certain mining businesses and other
2 employers are required to pay an excise tax (the modified business tax) on the
3 wages paid by them. (NRS 363A.130, 363B.160) Existing law establishes a credit
4 against the modified business tax paid by certain businesses equal to an amount
5 which is approved by the Department of Taxation and which must not exceed the
6 amount of any donation of money which is made by a taxpayer to a scholarship
7 organization that provides grants on behalf of pupils who are members of a
8 household with a household income which is not more than 300 percent of the
9 federally designated level signifying poverty to attend schools in this State,
10 including private schools, chosen by the parents or legal guardians of those pupils.
11 (NRS 363A.130, 363A.139, 363B.110, 363B.119, 388D.270) Section 1 of this bill:
12 (1) prohibits a scholarship organization from using a donation for which the donor
13 received a tax credit to provide a grant on behalf of a pupil unless the scholarship
14 organization also used a donation for which a donor received a tax credit to provide
-

– 2 –
15 a grant on behalf of the pupil for the immediately preceding school year at the same
16 school; and (2) requires a scholarship organization to repay the amount of any tax
17 credit approved by the Department if the scholarship organization violates this
18 provision. Section 1 requires a scholarship organization to notify the Department if
19 there ceases to be any pupil on whose behalf the scholarship organization is
20 authorized to make a grant. Sections 2 and 3 of this bill prohibit the Department
21 from approving an application for a tax credit made by a scholarship organization
22 that has provided or is required to provide this notification. Section 1 requires a
23 scholarship organization which, at the time it is required to provide this
24 notification, has not expended all of the donations for which a tax credit was
25 received by a taxpayer to repay to the Department the tax credits received in an
26 amount equal to the amount of the unexpended donations.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN

*AB364*

– 3 –

2 Index (All Items) published by the United States Department of
3 Labor for the preceding calendar year. On May 1 of each year, the
4 Department of Education shall determine the amount of increase
5 required by this subsection, establish the adjusted amounts to take
6 effect on July 1 of that year and notify each scholarship organization
7 of the adjusted amounts. The Department of Education shall also
8 post the adjusted amounts on its Internet website.
9 3. A grant provided on behalf of a pupil pursuant to subsection
10 1 must be paid directly to the school chosen by the parent or legal
11 guardian of the pupil.
12 4. A scholarship organization shall provide each taxpayer and
13 other person who makes a donation, gift or grant of money to the

15 with an affidavit, signed under penalty of perjury, which includes,
16 without limitation:
17 (a) A statement that the scholarship organization satisfies the
18 requirements set forth in subsection 1; and
19 (b) The total amount of the donation, gift or grant made to the
20 scholarship organization.
21 5. Each school in which a pupil is enrolled for whom a grant is
22 provided by a scholarship organization shall maintain a record of the
23 academic progress of the pupil. The record must be maintained in
24 such a manner that the information may be aggregated and reported
25 for all such pupils if reporting is required by the regulations of the
26 Department of Education.
27 6. A scholarship organization shall not use a donation for
28 which a taxpayer received a tax credit pursuant to NRS 363A.139
29 or 363B.119 to provide a grant pursuant to this section on behalf
30 of a pupil unless the scholarship organization used a donation for

32 or 363B.119 to provide a grant pursuant to this section on behalf
33 of the pupil for the immediately preceding school year for the
34 same school. A scholarship organization that violates this
35 subjection shall repay to the Department of Taxation the amount
36 of the tax credit received by the taxpayer pursuant to NRS
37 363A.139 or 363B.119, as applicable.
38 7. If, pursuant to subsection 6, there ceases to be any pupil on
39 whose behalf a scholarship organization is authorized to provide a
40 grant, the scholarship organization shall notify the Department of
41 Taxation of that fact. If a scholarship organization has not, at that
42 time, expended all of the donations for which a taxpayer received
43 a tax credit pursuant to NRS 363A.139 or 363B.119, the
44 scholarship organization shall repay to the Department of
45 Taxation an amount of the tax credit received by taxpayers

18 who intends to make a donation of money to a scholarship

25 Taxation shall, within 20 days after receiving the application,
26 approve or deny the application and provide to the scholarship

28 approved, the amount of the credit authorized. Upon receipt of
29 notice that the application has been approved, the scholarship
30 organization shall provide notice of the approval to the taxpayer
31 who must, not later than 30 days after receiving the notice, make the
