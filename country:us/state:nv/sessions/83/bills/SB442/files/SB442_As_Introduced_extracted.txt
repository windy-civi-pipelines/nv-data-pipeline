THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 704.1835 is hereby amended to read as
2 follows:
3 704.1835 1. For the purposes of protecting the health of
4 residential customers who receive gas, water or electricity from
5 public utilities, the Commission shall adopt or amend regulations
6 that:
7 (a) Establish the criteria that will be used to determine when a
8 public utility is required to postpone its termination of utility service
9 to the residence of a residential customer who has failed to pay for
10 such service. Such criteria may be based in part upon the residential
11 customer’s ability to pay.
12 (b) Require a public utility to postpone its termination of utility
13 service to the residence of a residential customer who has failed to
14 pay for such service if the residential customer satisfies the criteria
15 established by the Commission and termination of the utility service
16 is reasonably likely to threaten the health of an occupant of the
17 residence of the residential customer.
18 2. In addition to the regulations adopted pursuant to subsection
19 1, for the purposes of regulating public utilities that provide gas,
20 water or electricity to landlords who pay for the utility service and
21 who distribute or resell the gas, water or electricity to one or more
22 residential tenants, the Commission shall adopt or amend
23 regulations to require a public utility to use its best efforts to post, in
24 a conspicuous location, notice of the intent of the public utility to
25 terminate utility service because the landlord has failed to pay for
26 such service. Such notice must provide sufficient information to
27 allow residential tenants or their occupants to contact the public
28 utility if termination of the utility service is reasonably likely to
29 threaten the health of an occupant of the residence of a residential
30 tenant.
31 3. The Commission shall adopt regulations to require a
32 public utility to submit a monthly report to the Commission that
33 includes, without limitation:
34 (a) The total number of terminations of utility service to the
35 residences of residential customers during the previous month;
36 and
37 (b) Aggregated demographic information concerning the
38 residential customers described in paragraph (a), including,
39 without limitation, the zip code of such residences.
40 4. A public utility shall not terminate utility service for gas,
41 water or electricity without complying with the regulations adopted
42 by the Commission pursuant to this section.
