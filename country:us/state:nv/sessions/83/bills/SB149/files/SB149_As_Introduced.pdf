Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes the Department of Health and Human Services to enter
2 into a contract with a pharmacy benefit manager or a health maintenance
3 organization to manage coverage of prescription drugs under the State Plan for
4 Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program and certain other health benefit
5 plans that elect to use the list of preferred prescription drugs established for
6 Medicaid as their formulary. (NRS 422.4025, 422.4053)
7 Section 13 of this bill instead requires the Department to enter into a contract
8 with one pharmacy benefit manager, known as the state pharmacy benefit manager,
9 to manage all such coverage of prescription drugs. Sections 13 and 14 of this bill
10 prescribe certain required terms of such a contract. Section 4 of this bill prescribes
11 the required contents of an application to serve as the state pharmacy benefit
12 manager. Section 5 of this bill requires the Department to adopt regulations
13 establishing: (1) the criteria that a pharmacy benefit manager must meet in order to

14 serve as the state pharmacy benefit manager; and (2) certain requirements relating
15 to the payment of pharmacies for services rendered under the contract between the
16 Department and the state pharmacy benefit manager. Section 9 of this bill requires
17 a Medicaid managed care organization to contract with and utilize the state
18 pharmacy benefit manager to administer all pharmacy benefits for recipients of
19 Medicaid who receive such benefits through the Medicaid managed care
20 organization.
21 Section 6 of this bill requires that the Department approve any contract
22 between the state pharmacy benefit manager and a pharmacy or an entity that
23 contracts on behalf of a pharmacy if the contract is for the provision of benefits
24 under the contract between the state pharmacy benefit manager and the
25 Department, or any revision, suspension or termination of such a contract, in order
26 for the contract, revision, suspension or termination to become effective. Section 6
27 also authorizes the Department to change certain payment arrangements as
28 necessary to comply with federal requirements. Finally, section 6 prohibits the state
29 pharmacy benefit manager from entering into, renewing or amending a contract that
30 conflicts with the obligations of the state pharmacy benefit manager under the
31 provisions of this bill. Section 7 of this bill: (1) prohibits the state pharmacy benefit
32 manager from taking certain actions to avoid paying reimbursement owed to
33 pharmacies; and (2) authorizes the Department to impose a monetary penalty on the
34 state pharmacy benefit manager for violating that prohibition.
35 Sections 2 and 3 of this bill define certain terms, and section 8 of this bill
36 establishes the applicability of those definitions. Section 10 of this bill applies
37 certain other definitions in existing law to sections 4-7. Sections 11, 12 and 15 of
38 this bill make conforming changes to transfer certain duties to the state pharmacy
39 benefit manager and revise certain references in accordance with the provisions of

38 of the recipient when prescribed in accordance with clinical
39 indications, clinical guidelines or other peer-reviewed evidence;
40 (b) Delay of effective treatment would have severe or

12 health maintenance organization, as applicable,] approves an
13 application for an exemption from step therapy pursuant to this
14 section, the State must pay the nonfederal share of the cost of the
