Section 1:
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to records of criminal history; revising provisions
authorizing certain entities to obtain information relating to
the records of criminal history of certain persons responsible
for the safety and well-being of children, elderly persons or
persons with disabilities; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing federal law authorizes a state to establish by statute or regulation
procedures that require designated qualified entities, which are businesses or
organizations that provide care or care placement services to children, elderly
persons or persons with disabilities, to contact an authorized state agency to request
a nationwide background check to determine whether certain persons have been
convicted of a crime that bears upon the fitness of the person to have responsibility
for the safety and well-being of children, elderly persons or persons with
disabilities. (34 U.S.C. §§ 40102(a)(1), 40104(5), 40104(9), 40104(10)) Existing
federal law requires such procedures to include certain requirements. (34 U.S.C. §
40102(b)) Pursuant to that federal law, existing state law establishes procedures by
which a qualified entity may obtain information relating to the records of criminal
history of employees, volunteers, persons applying to be an employee or volunteer
and covered individuals of the qualified entity who have access to children, elderly
persons or persons with disabilities. (NRS 179A.325) This bill revises those
procedures to allow a qualified entity to obtain such information concerning
independent contractors and vendors of the qualified entity.
Existing federal law defines the term “covered individual” to include, among
other persons, a person who is employed by or volunteers with, or seeks to be
employed by or volunteer with, a qualified entity. (34 U.S.C. § 40104(9)) This bill
eliminates references set forth in existing state law to an employee, volunteer or
person applying to be an employee or volunteer of a qualified entity that are
duplicative of the definition of “covered individual” set forth in existing federal
law.
