AN ACT relating to records of criminal history; revising provisions
authorizing certain entities to obtain information relating
to the records of criminal history of certain persons
responsible for the safety and well-being of children,
elderly persons or persons with disabilities; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing federal law authorizes a state to establish by statute or regulation
2 procedures that require designated qualified entities, which are businesses or
3 organizations that provide care or care placement services to children, elderly
4 persons or persons with disabilities, to contact an authorized state agency to request
5 a nationwide background check to determine whether certain persons have been
6 convicted of a crime that bears upon the fitness of the person to have responsibility
7 for the safety and well-being of children, elderly persons or persons with
8 disabilities. (34 U.S.C. §§ 40102(a)(1), 40104(5), 40104(9), 40104(10)) Existing
9 federal law requires such procedures to include certain requirements. (34 U.S.C. §
10 40102(b)) Pursuant to that federal law, existing state law establishes procedures by
11 which a qualified entity may obtain information relating to the records of criminal
12 history of employees, volunteers, persons applying to be an employee or volunteer
13 and covered individuals of the qualified entity who have access to children, elderly
14 persons or persons with disabilities. (NRS 179A.325) This bill revises those
-
*SB26*

– 2 –
15 procedures to allow a qualified entity to obtain such information concerning
16 independent contractors and vendors of the qualified entity.
17 Existing federal law defines the term “covered individual” to include, among
18 other persons, a person who is employed by or volunteers with, or seeks to be
19 employed by or volunteer with, a qualified entity. (34 U.S.C. § 40104(9)) This bill
20 eliminates references set forth in existing state law to an employee, volunteer or
21 person applying to be an employee or volunteer of a qualified entity that are
22 duplicative of the definition of “covered individual” set forth in existing federal
23 law.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 179A.325 is hereby amended to read as

8 by the Central Repository.
9 (b) Provide written notification to any person being screened
10 regarding the right of the person to obtain a copy of his or her
11 background screening report, including, without limitation, any
12 records of criminal history contained in the report, to appeal the
13 results of the background screening report to challenge the accuracy
14 and completeness of any information contained therein, and to
15 obtain a determination as to the validity of such a challenge before
16 the qualified entity makes a final determination as to the fitness of

29 to have responsibility for the safety and well-being of children,
30 elderly persons or persons with disabilities is the sole responsibility
31 of the qualified entity that submitted the request for screening. The
32 qualified entity shall make such a determination pursuant to the
33 procedures set forth in the VECHS program based on whether
34 the information relating to the records of criminal history of the
35 person indicates that the person has been convicted of or is subject
36 to pending criminal charges or a pending indictment for any crime
37 that bears upon his or her fitness to have responsibility for the safety
38 and well-being of children, elderly persons or persons with
39 disabilities. The provisions of this section must not be construed to
40 require the Central Repository to make such a determination on
41 behalf of any qualified entity.
42 6. A qualified entity that is required by law to apply screening
43 criteria, including, without limitation, any right to contest or request
