Assembly Bill No. 305–Committee
on Commerce and Labor
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to providers of health care; limiting the amount a
provider of health care may charge to fill out certain forms
necessary to take a leave of absence authorized by the Family
and Medical Leave Act of 1993; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, certain employees have the
right to take an unpaid leave of absence from work for certain medical or family
reasons, including, without limitation: (1) because of a serious health condition of
the employee that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of his or her
position; (2) to care for certain family members who have a serious health
condition; or (3) to care for certain veterans or members of the Armed Forces who
have suffered a serious injury or illness. (29 U.S.C. § 2612) The Act authorizes an
employer of an employee who requests leave for one of those reasons to require the
employee to provide a certification issued by a health care provider that contains
certain information concerning the serious health condition or serious injury or
illness. (29 U.S.C. § 2613; 29 C.F.R. §§ 825.305-825.310) This bill prohibits a
provider of health care from charging a person more than $30 to fill out a form for
such a certification. This bill requires that amount to be adjusted annually based on
the Consumer Price Index (All Items) for the immediately preceding year. The
Department of Health and Human Services is required to determine the amount of
the adjustment on or before January 1 of each year and establish the adjusted
amount to take effect on January 1 of that year. This bill also requires the
Department to post the adjusted amount on its Internet website.
