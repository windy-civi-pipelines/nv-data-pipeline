AN ACT relating to providers of health care; limiting the amount a
provider of health care may charge to fill out certain
forms necessary to take a leave of absence authorized by
the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, certain employees have the
2 right to take an unpaid leave of absence from work for certain medical or family
3 reasons, including, without limitation: (1) because of a serious health condition of
4 the employee that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of his or her
5 position; (2) to care for certain family members who have a serious health
6 condition; or (3) to care for certain veterans or members of the Armed Forces who
7 have suffered a serious injury or illness. (29 U.S.C. § 2612) The Act authorizes an
8 employer of an employee who requests leave for one of those reasons to require the
9 employee to provide a certification issued by a health care provider that contains
10 certain information concerning the serious health condition or serious injury or
11 illness. (29 U.S.C. § 2613; 29 C.F.R. §§ 825.305-825.310) This bill prohibits a
12 provider of health care from charging a person more than $30 to fill out a form for
13 such a certification. This bill requires that amount to be adjusted annually based on
14 the Consumer Price Index (All Items) for the immediately preceding year. The
15 Department of Health and Human Services is required to determine the amount of
16 the adjustment on or before January 1 of each year and establish the adjusted
17 amount to take effect on January 1 of that year. This bill also requires the
18 Department to post the adjusted amount on its Internet website.
