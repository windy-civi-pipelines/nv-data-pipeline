AN ACT relating to providers of health care; limiting the amount a provider of
health care may charge to fill out certain forms necessary to take a
leave of absence authorized by the Family and Medical Leave Act of
1993; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, certain employees have the right to
2 take an unpaid leave of absence from work for certain medical or family reasons, including,
3 without limitation: (1) because of a serious health condition of the employee that makes the
4 employee unable to perform the functions of his or her position; (2) to care for certain family
5 members who have a serious health condition; or (3) to care for certain veterans or members
6 of the Armed Forces who have suffered a serious injury or illness. (29 U.S.C. § 2612) The Act
7 authorizes an employer of an employee who requests leave for one of those reasons to require
8 the employee to provide a certification issued by a health care provider that contains certain
9 information concerning the serious health condition or serious injury or illness. (29 U.S.C. §
10 2613; 29 C.F.R. §§ 825.305-825.310) This bill prohibits a provider of health care from
11 charging a person more than [$10] $30 to fill out a form for such a certification. This bill
12 requires that amount to be adjusted annually based on the Consumer Price Index (All
13 Items) for the immediately preceding year. The Department of Health and Human
14 Services is required to determine the amount of the adjustment on or before January 1
15 of each year and establish the adjusted amount to take effect on January 1 of that year.
16 This bill also requires the Department to post the adjusted amount on its Internet
17 website.
