EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to public financial administration; requiring
certain money from the sale of property for delinquent
taxes to be accounted for separately in a county general
fund and used to pay for the acquisition and improvement
of technology used in the office of the county treasurer;
revising the contents of a notice of delinquent taxes;
revising provisions relating to certain property held in
trust by a county treasurer; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the tax receiver of a county to mail notice of delinquent
2 taxes to certain persons. The notice of delinquency must state certain information,
3 including that if the amount of delinquent taxes is not paid, the tax receiver will, at
4 5 p.m. on the first Monday in June of the current year, issue a certificate
5 authorizing the county treasurer to hold the property. (NRS 361.5648) Section 2 of
6 this bill provides instead that the notice of delinquency must state that if the amount
7 of delinquent taxes is not paid, the tax receiver will, at the close of business of the
8 tax receiver of the county on the first Monday in June of the current year, issue a
9 certificate authorizing the county treasurer to hold the property.
10 Existing law requires the tax receiver to make out a trustee’s certificate that
11 describes each property on which delinquent taxes, penalties, interest and costs
12 have not been paid. The trustee’s certificate authorizes the county treasurer to hold
13 each property for a certain period of time. (NRS 361.570) When the time allowed
14 by law for the redemption of a property described in the certificate has expired and
15 no redemption has been made, the tax receiver who issued the certificate is required
16 to execute and deliver to the county treasurer a deed of the property. Upon
17 obtaining such a deed, the county treasurer is required to hold the property in trust
18 until it is sold or otherwise disposed of. Existing law provides that during certain
19 periods or not later than 5 p.m. on the third business day before the day of the sale
-

– 2 –
20 by a county treasurer, certain persons are entitled to have the property reconveyed
21 upon the receipt by the county treasurer of payment of the delinquent taxes and
22 certain costs. (NRS 361.585) Section 3 of this bill provides instead that during
23 certain periods or not later than the close of business of the county treasurer on the
24 third business day before the day of the sale by a county treasurer, certain persons
25 are entitled to have the property reconveyed upon the receipt by the county
26 treasurer of payment of the delinquent taxes and certain costs.
27 Existing law authorizes, under certain circumstances, the county treasurer to
28 sell property held in trust because of delinquent taxes. Upon payment, the county
29 treasurer is required, with certain exceptions, to issue a quitclaim deed to the
30 purchaser. Existing law provides an exception to this requirement to issue a
31 quitclaim deed under certain circumstances, if, not later than 5 p.m. on the third
32 business day immediately preceding the day of the sale by the county treasurer, a
33 municipality provides the county treasurer with an affidavit that meets certain
34 requirements. (NRS 361.595) Section 4 of this bill provides instead that, under
35 certain circumstances, the county treasurer may not issue the quitclaim deed if, not
36 later than the close of business of the county treasurer on the third business day
37 immediately preceding the day of the sale by the county treasurer, a municipality
38 provides the county treasurer with an affidavit that meets certain requirements.
39 Under existing law, if the county treasurer sells property held in trust because
40 of delinquent taxes, the county treasurer is required to pay certain costs and taxes
41 from the excess proceeds from the sale and then pay into the county general fund:
42 (1) the first $300 of the excess proceeds; (2) 10 percent of the next $10,000 of the
43 excess proceeds; and (3) the amount remaining to be held separately for a certain
44 period of time, and if not claimed by certain persons who had a secured interest in
45 the property, then into the county general fund. (NRS 361.610) Section 5 of this
46 bill provides that after the payment of certain costs and taxes, 5 percent of the
47 excess proceeds must be accounted for separately in the county general fund
48 pursuant to section 1 of this bill. The money in the account is only authorized to be
49 used to acquire technology or improve technology used in the office of the county
50 treasurer. Section 1 also requires the county treasurer to submit an annual report to
51 the board of county commissioners by July 1 setting forth the projected expenditure
52 of money in the account for the following fiscal year.
53 Existing law sets forth certain procedures allowing a person to make a claim for
54 the excess proceeds from the sale by the county treasurer of property held in trust
55 because of delinquent taxes, including, without limitation, requiring certain
56 indeterminable claims to be submitted to mediation, and if mediation is
57 unsuccessful, then requiring the county treasurer to conduct a hearing or file an
58 action for interpleader. (NRS 361.610) Section 5 eliminates conducting a hearing
59 as a method for determining certain indeterminable claims, instead requiring the
60 county treasurer to file an action for interpleader following any unsuccessful
61 mediation. Existing law authorizes a person to enter into an agreement to locate,
62 deliver, recover or assist in the recovery of excess proceeds by certain persons.
63 However, if the agreement is entered into by a natural person who occupied the
64 property as his or her primary residence at the time of the sale, any such agreement
65 must not provide for a fee of more than 10 percent of the remaining excess
66 proceeds due that person. (NRS 361.610) Section 5 removes the limitation that the
67 property must have been occupied by a natural person as his or her primary
68 residence at the time of sale and instead applies the 10 percent cap to the fee of: (1)
69 any natural person; and (2) certain persons who are otherwise authorized by power
70 of attorney, assignment or any other legal instrument by another person to file a
71 claim with and collect from the county treasurer any property owed to the person.

44 the clerk of the board of county commissioners, proper affidavits of
45 posting and of publication of the notice of sale, as the case may be,
-
*AB133*

– 8 –
1 together with his or her return of sale, verified, showing compliance
2 with the order of the board of county commissioners, which
3 constitutes primary evidence of the facts recited therein.
4 10. If the deed when regularly issued is not recorded in the
5 office of the county recorder, the deed, and all proceedings relating
6 thereto, is void as against any subsequent purchaser in good faith
7 and for a valuable consideration of the same property, or any portion
8 thereof, when his or her own conveyance is first recorded.
9 11. The board of county commissioners shall provide its clerk
10 with a record book in which must be indexed the name of each

25 2. In no case may:
26 (a) Any service rendered by any officer under this chapter
27 become or be allowed as a charge against the county; or
28 (b) The sale price or rent or redemption money of any one parcel
29 of property be appropriated to pay any cost or tax upon any other
30 parcel of property than that so sold, rented or redeemed.
31 3. After paying all the tax and costs upon any one parcel of
32 property, the county treasurer shall pay into the general fund of the

41 proceeds separate from other money of the county. If no claim is
42 made for the excess proceeds within 1 year after the deed given by

35 determine who is entitled to the excess proceeds, the matter must be
36 submitted to mediation.
37 8. If the mediation is not successful, the county treasurer shall
38 [:
39 (a) Conduct a hearing to determine who is entitled to the excess
40 proceeds; or

42 9. A person who is aggrieved by a determination of the county

2 amount of excess proceeds of a sale of a residential unit, as defined
3 in NRS 116.332, the amount recovered by the association shall be
4 deemed to have satisfied the debt owed by the owner of the
5 residential unit to the association and the association may not
6 recover in a civil action or otherwise collect any deficiency
7 remaining due to the association from the owner.
8 11. Any agreement to locate, deliver, recover or assist in the

10 into by a person listed in subsection 6 must:
11 (a) Be in writing.
12 (b) Be signed by the person listed in subsection 6.

16 primary residence at the time of the sale,] not provide for a fee of
17 more than 10 percent of the total remaining excess proceeds of the
18 sale due that person.
19 12. In addition to authorizing a person pursuant to an
20 agreement described in subsection 11 to file a claim and collect
21 from the county treasurer any property owed to the person, a person
22 listed in subsection 6 may authorize a person pursuant to a power of
23 attorney, assignment or any other legal instrument to file a claim
24 and collect from the county treasurer any property owed to him or
25 her. Any person authorized pursuant to a power of attorney,
26 assignment or any other legal instrument to file a claim and
27 collect from the county treasurer any property may collect a fee of
28 not more than 10 percent of the total remaining excess proceeds of
29 the sale due the person making the authorization. The county is
30 not liable for any losses resulting from the approval of the claim if
31 the claim is paid by the county treasurer in accordance with the
32 provisions of the legal instrument.
