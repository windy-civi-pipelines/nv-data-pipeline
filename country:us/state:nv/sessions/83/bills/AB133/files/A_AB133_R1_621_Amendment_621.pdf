AN ACT relating to public financial administration; revising the hours the office of
the county treasurer is required to be kept open; requiring certain
money from the sale of property for delinquent taxes to be accounted
for separately in a county general fund and used to pay for the
acquisition and improvement of technology used in the office of the
county treasurer; revising the contents of a notice of delinquent taxes;
revising provisions relating to certain property held in trust by a county
treasurer; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires, subject to certain exceptions, sheriffs, county recorders and county
2 auditors, county clerks, county assessors and county treasurers to keep open the county office
3 and branch offices, if any, on all days except Sundays and nonjudicial days from 9 a.m. to 12
4 p.m., and on all days except Sundays, nonjudicial days and Saturdays from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m.
5 Existing law also authorizes the board of county commissioners of any county to designate or
6 authorize deviation from the days and hours, but requires each office to be kept open for not
7 less than 40 hours during each week. (NRS 245.040) Existing law establishes that the county
8 treasurers are tax receivers for the county. (NRS 361.475) Section 1 of this bill provides that
9 the county office and branch offices, if any, of the county treasurer must not close earlier than
10 5 p.m. on any business day but may close later than 5 p.m.
11 Existing law requires the tax receiver of a county to mail notice of delinquent taxes to
12 certain persons. The notice of delinquency must state certain information, including that if the
13 amount of delinquent taxes is not paid, the tax receiver will, at 5 p.m. on the first Monday in
14 June of the current year, issue a certificate authorizing the county treasurer to hold the
15 property. (NRS 361.5648) Section 2 of this bill provides instead that the notice of delinquency
16 must state that if the amount of delinquent taxes is not paid, the tax receiver will, at the close
17 of business of the tax receiver of the county on the first Monday in June of the current year,
18 issue a certificate authorizing the county treasurer to hold the property.
19 Existing law requires the tax receiver to make out a trustee’s certificate that describes
20 each property on which delinquent taxes, penalties, interest and costs have not been paid. The
21 trustee’s certificate authorizes the county treasurer to hold each property for a certain period
22 of time. (NRS 361.570) When the time allowed by law for the redemption of a property
23 described in the certificate has expired and no redemption has been made, the tax receiver
24 who issued the certificate is required to execute and deliver to the county treasurer a deed of

Senate Amendment No. 621 to Assembly Bill No. 133 First Reprint Page 4
25 the property. Upon obtaining such a deed, the county treasurer is required to hold the property
26 in trust until it is sold or otherwise disposed of. Existing law provides that during certain
27 periods or not later than 5 p.m. on the third business day before the day of the sale by a county
28 treasurer, certain persons are entitled to have the property reconveyed upon the receipt by the
29 county treasurer of payment of the delinquent taxes and certain costs. (NRS 361.585) Section
30 3 of this bill provides instead that during certain periods or not later than the close of business
31 of the county treasurer on the third business day before the day of the sale by a county
32 treasurer, certain persons are entitled to have the property reconveyed upon the receipt by the
33 county treasurer of payment of the delinquent taxes and certain costs.
34 Existing law authorizes, under certain circumstances, the county treasurer to sell property
35 held in trust because of delinquent taxes. Upon payment, the county treasurer is required, with
36 certain exceptions, to issue a quitclaim deed to the purchaser. Existing law provides an
37 exception to this requirement to issue a quitclaim deed under certain circumstances, if, not
38 later than 5 p.m. on the third business day immediately preceding the day of the sale by the
39 county treasurer, a municipality provides the county treasurer with an affidavit that meets
40 certain requirements. (NRS 361.595) Section 4 of this bill provides instead that, under certain
41 circumstances, the county treasurer may not issue the quitclaim deed if, not later than the
42 close of business of the county treasurer on the third business day immediately preceding the
43 day of the sale by the county treasurer, a municipality provides the county treasurer with an
44 affidavit that meets certain requirements.
45 Under existing law, if the county treasurer sells property held in trust because of
46 delinquent taxes, the county treasurer is required to pay certain costs and taxes from the
47 excess proceeds from the sale and then pay into the county general fund: (1) the first $300 of
48 the excess proceeds; (2) 10 percent of the next $10,000 of the excess proceeds; and (3) the
49 amount remaining to be held separately for a certain period of time, and if not claimed by
50 certain persons who had a secured interest in the property, then into the county general fund.
51 (NRS 361.610) Section 5 of this bill provides that of the amount remaining to be held
52 separately for a certain period of time, and if not claimed, 5 percent of the total amount
53 remaining must be accounted for separately in the county general fund pursuant to section 1.5
54 of this bill. The money in the account is only authorized to be used to acquire technology or
55 improve technology used in the office of the county treasurer. Section 1.5 also requires the
56 county treasurer to submit an annual report to the board of county commissioners by July 1
57 setting forth the projected expenditure of money in the account for the following fiscal year.
58 Section 1.5 also authorizes a board of county commissioners to revert 50 percent of any
59 balance of unexpended or unencumbered money after 3 years.
60 Existing law sets forth certain procedures allowing a person to make a claim for the
61 excess proceeds from the sale by the county treasurer of property held in trust because of
62 delinquent taxes, including, without limitation, requiring certain indeterminable claims to be
63 submitted to mediation, and if mediation is unsuccessful, then requiring the county treasurer
64 to conduct a hearing or file an action for interpleader. (NRS 361.610) Section 5 eliminates
65 conducting a hearing as a method for determining certain indeterminable claims, instead
66 requiring the county treasurer to file an action for interpleader following any unsuccessful
67 mediation. Existing law authorizes a person to enter into an agreement to locate, deliver,
68 recover or assist in the recovery of excess proceeds by certain persons. However, if the
69 agreement is entered into by a natural person who occupied the property as his or her primary
70 residence at the time of the sale, any such agreement must not provide for a fee of more than
71 10 percent of the remaining excess proceeds due that person. (NRS 361.610) Section 5
72 removes the limitation that the property must have been occupied by a natural person as his or
73 her primary residence at the time of sale and instead applies the 10 percent cap to the fee of:
74 (1) any natural person; and (2) certain persons who are otherwise authorized by power of
75 attorney, assignment or any other legal instrument by another person to file a claim with and
76 collect from the county treasurer any property owed to the person.

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 245.040 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 245.040 1. Sheriffs, county recorders and county auditors, county clerks,
3 county assessors and county treasurers shall keep an office at the county seat of
4 their county which, except as otherwise provided in subsections 3 and 4, must be
5 kept open on all days except Sundays and nonjudicial days from 9 a.m. to 12 m.,
6 and on all days except Sundays, nonjudicial days and Saturdays from 1 p.m. to 5
7 p.m. for the transaction of public business, but nothing contained in this subsection
8 interferes with a duty now required of a public officer under the election laws of
9 this State. County clerks shall keep their offices open on all election days during the
10 hours when the polls are open for voting but may, with the consent of the district
11 judge of the county, close their offices for all purposes except election business and
12 the issuance of marriage licenses on any day on which the primary or general
13 election is held.
14 2. [Notwithstanding] Except as otherwise provided in subsection 5 and
15 notwithstanding the provisions of subsection 1, the board of county commissioners
16 of any county may, by an order regularly made and entered in the records of its
17 proceedings, designate the days and hours during which the offices of the sheriff,
18 county recorder and county auditor, county clerk, county assessor and county
19 treasurer must be kept open for the transaction of public business. An order so
20 made and entered must require each office to be kept open for not less than 40
21 hours during each week, and must not prevent the county clerk from closing his or
22 her office for all purposes except election business and the issuance of marriage
23 licenses on primary and general election days as provided in subsection 1.
24 3. The board of county commissioners may authorize a county officer to rent,
25 equip and operate, at public expense, one or more branch offices in the county. The
26 branch office may be kept open for the transaction of public business on the days
27 and during the hours specified in subsections 1 and 2 or on such days and during
28 such hours as determined by the board. The provisions of this subsection do not
29 preempt any other statutory provisions which require certain duties to be performed
30 at the county seat.
31 4. Any county office may deviate from the hours of operation required
32 pursuant to this section if the board of county commissioners approves the plan for
33 the deviation submitted by the office, except that no such deviation may conflict
34 with the election laws of this State. Such a plan must be fiscally neutral or result in
35 cost savings.
36 5. The board of county commissioners of any county shall not designate or
37 approve the county office or branch offices, if any, of the county treasurer to
38 close earlier than 5 p.m. for the transaction of business on [all days except
39 Saturdays, Sundays and nonjudicial days.] any business day. Nothing in this
40 subsection shall be construed to prohibit the offices from closing later than 5 p.m.
41 6. A county officer who violates the provisions of this section is guilty of a
42 misdemeanor, and if an officer mentioned in subsection 1 absents himself or herself
43 from office, except:
44 (a) When called away from his or her office by official duties;
45 (b) When expressly permitted so to do by the board of county commissioners
46 or a majority of the members thereof in writing; or
47 (c) When he or she makes provision to leave his or her office open for the
48 transaction of public business on the days and during the hours prescribed by this
49 section and in charge of a deputy qualified to act in the county officer’s absence,

Senate Amendment No. 621 to Assembly Bill No. 133 First Reprint Page 6
1  there must be withheld from the county officer’s monthly salary that proportion
2 thereof as the number of days of absence bears to the number of days of the month
3 in which the absence occurs. The money must be withheld from payment of salary
4 to the officer for the next succeeding month by order of the board of county
5 commissioners, but such an order must not be made without first giving the officer
6 affected reasonable notice and an opportunity to appear before the board and defend
7 the charge against him or her.
8 Sec. 1.5. Chapter 249 of NRS is hereby amended by adding thereto a new
9 section to read as follows:
10 1. Any money received by the county treasurer pursuant to paragraph (a) of
11 subsection [3] 4 of NRS 361.610 must be accounted for separately in the county
12 general fund.
13 2. Money in the account:
14 (a) May only be used to acquire technology for or improve the technology
15 used in the office of the county treasurer, including, without limitation, the
16 payment of any costs associated with acquiring or improving technology for
17 converting or archiving records, purchasing hardware or software, maintaining
18 the technology, training employees in the operation of the technology and

24 revert to the county general fund, and the balance in the account must be carried

27 invested. All interest earned on the deposit or investment of the money in the
28 account, after deducting any applicable charges, must be credited to the account.

30 paid.
31 5. On or before July 1 of each year, the county treasurer shall submit a
32 report to the board of county commissioners setting forth the projected
33 expenditure of money in the account for the following fiscal year.
34 6. Fifty percent of any balance of unexpended or unencumbered money
35 remaining in the account after 3 years shall be deemed dormant and subject to
36 transfer at the discretion of and order by a board of county commissioners
37 pursuant to NRS 354.150.
38 Sec. 2. NRS 361.5648 is hereby amended to read as follows:

6 the county treasurer, as trustee for the State and county, a certificate authorizing the

24 not less than 60 days before the expiration of the period of redemption as stated in
25 the notice.
26 5. The cost of each mailing must be charged to the delinquent taxpayer.
27 6. A county and its officers and employees are not liable for any damages

30 interest in the property, relies upon a preliminary title search from a company
31 authorized to provide title insurance in this State.
32 Sec. 3. NRS 361.585 is hereby amended to read as follows:
33 361.585 1. When the time allowed by law for the redemption of a property

19 any deed made pursuant to the provisions of this chapter may be sold and conveyed
20 in the manner prescribed in this section and in NRS 361.603 or conveyed without

22 2. If the property is to be sold, the board of county commissioners may make

24 treasurer to sell the property particularly described therein, after giving notice of
25 sale, for a total amount not less than the amount of the taxes, costs, penalties and
26 interest legally chargeable against the property as stated in the order.
27 3. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 4, notice of the sale must
28 specify the day, time and place of the sale and be:
29 (a) Posted in at least three public places in the county, including one at the
30 courthouse and one on the property, not less than 20 days before the day of sale or,
31 in lieu of such a posting, by publication of the notice at least once a week for 4
32 consecutive weeks by four weekly insertions in some newspaper published within
33 the county, the first publication being at least 22 days before the day of the sale, if
34 the board of county commissioners so directs.
35 (b) Mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, not less than 90 days
36 before the day of the sale, to the owner of the parcel as shown on the tax roll and to
37 any person or governmental entity that appears in the records of the county to have
38 a lien or other interest in the property. If the receipt is returned unsigned, the county
39 treasurer must make a reasonable attempt to locate and notify the owner or other
40 person or governmental entity before the sale.
41 4. If, pursuant to NRS 361.567, the tax receiver has elected to use an
42 expedited procedure for the sale of the property and the requirements of NRS
43 361.567 were met, notice of the sale must specify the day, time and place of the
44 sale and be:
45 (a) Posted in at least three public places in the county, including one at the
46 courthouse and one on the property, not less than 20 days before the day of sale or,
47 in lieu of such a posting, by publication of the notice at least once a week for 4
48 consecutive weeks by four weekly insertions in some newspaper published within
49 the county, the first publication being at least 22 days before the day of the sale, if
50 the board of county commissioners so directs.
51 (b) Mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, not less than 45 days
52 before the day of the sale, to the owner of the parcel as shown on the tax roll and to
53 any person or governmental entity that appears in the records of the county to have

Senate Amendment No. 621 to Assembly Bill No. 133 First Reprint Page 9
1 a lien or other interest in the property. If the receipt is returned unsigned, the county
2 treasurer must make a reasonable attempt to locate and notify the owner or other
3 person or governmental entity before the sale.
4 5. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 6, the county treasurer shall
5 make, execute and deliver to any purchaser, upon payment to the county treasurer,
6 as trustee, of a consideration not less than that specified in the order, a quitclaim
7 deed, discharged of any trust of the property mentioned in the order.
8 6. If, not later than [5 p.m.] the close of business of the county treasurer on
9 the third business day immediately preceding the day of the sale by the county
10 treasurer, a municipality provides the county treasurer with an affidavit signed by
11 the treasurer of the municipality stating that:
12 (a) The municipality sold the property or the property was stricken off to the
13 municipality pursuant to NRS 271.560; and
14 (b) A certificate of sale for the property was issued to the purchaser pursuant to
15 NRS 271.570 or to the municipality pursuant to NRS 271.560,
16  the county treasurer may not issue the quitclaim deed described in subsection 5
17 unless the person who purchased the property from the county pays to the
18 municipality any amount owed pursuant to the certificate of sale issued pursuant to
19 NRS 271.560 and 271.570 and the municipality provides an affidavit signed by the
20 treasurer of the municipality stating that such amounts have been paid. If the
21 purchaser does not pay the amount owed to the municipality within 20 days after
22 the sale of the property by the county, the sale of the property by the county is void
23 and the county treasurer may retain for administrative costs not more than 10
24 percent of the purchase amount paid by the purchaser.
25 7. Before delivering a deed, the county treasurer shall record the deed at the
26 expense of the purchaser.
27 8. All deeds issued pursuant to this section, whether issued before, on or after
28 July 1, 1955, are primary evidence:
29 (a) Of the regularity of all proceedings relating to the order of the board of
30 county commissioners, the notice of sale and the sale of the property;
31 (b) That if, pursuant to NRS 361.567, the tax receiver has elected to use an
32 expedited procedure for the sale of the property, the property is abandoned; and
33 (c) That, if the real property was sold to pay taxes on personal property, the
34 real property belonged to the person liable to pay the tax.
35 9. No deed may be executed and delivered by the county treasurer until he or
36 she files at the expense of the purchaser, with the clerk of the board of county
37 commissioners, proper affidavits of posting and of publication of the notice of sale,
38 as the case may be, together with his or her return of sale, verified, showing
39 compliance with the order of the board of county commissioners, which constitutes
40 primary evidence of the facts recited therein.
41 10. If the deed when regularly issued is not recorded in the office of the
42 county recorder, the deed, and all proceedings relating thereto, is void as against
43 any subsequent purchaser in good faith and for a valuable consideration of the same
44 property, or any portion thereof, when his or her own conveyance is first recorded.
45 11. The board of county commissioners shall provide its clerk with a record
46 book in which must be indexed the name of each purchaser, together with the date
47 of sale, a description of the property sold, a reference to the book and page of the
48 minutes of the board of county commissioners where the order of sale is recorded,
49 and the file number of the affidavits and return.
50 Sec. 5. NRS 361.610 is hereby amended to read as follows:
51 361.610 1. Out of the sale price or rents of any property of which he or she
52 is trustee, the county treasurer shall pay the costs due any officer for the
53 enforcement of the tax upon the parcel of property and all taxes owing thereon, and

Senate Amendment No. 621 to Assembly Bill No. 133 First Reprint Page 10
1 upon the redemption of any property from the county treasurer as trustee, he or she
2 shall pay the redemption money over to any officers having fees due them from the
3 parcels of property and pay the tax for which it was sold and pay the redemption
4 percentage according to the proportion those fees respectively bear to the tax.
5 2. In no case may:
6 (a) Any service rendered by any officer under this chapter become or be
7 allowed as a charge against the county; or
8 (b) The sale price or rent or redemption money of any one parcel of property
9 be appropriated to pay any cost or tax upon any other parcel of property than that so
10 sold, rented or redeemed.
11 3. After paying all the tax and costs upon any one parcel of property, the
12 county treasurer shall pay into the general fund of the county, from the excess
13 proceeds of the sale:
14 (a) The first $300 of the excess proceeds; and
15 (b) Ten percent of the next $10,000 of the excess proceeds.
