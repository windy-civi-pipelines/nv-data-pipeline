Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires, subject to certain exceptions, sheriffs, county recorders
2 and county auditors, county clerks, county assessors and county treasurers to keep
3 open the county office and branch offices, if any, on all days except Sundays and
4 nonjudicial days from 9 a.m. to 12 p.m., and on all days except Sundays,
5 nonjudicial days and Saturdays from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. Existing law also authorizes
6 the board of county commissioners of any county to designate or authorize
7 deviation from the days and hours, but requires each office to be kept open for not
8 less than 40 hours during each week. (NRS 245.040) Existing law establishes that
9 the county treasurers are tax receivers for the county. (NRS 361.475) Section 1 of
10 this bill provides that the county office and branch offices, if any, of the county
11 treasurer must not close earlier than 5 p.m. on any business day but may close later
12 than 5 p.m.
13 Existing law requires the tax receiver of a county to mail notice of delinquent
14 taxes to certain persons. The notice of delinquency must state certain information,
15 including that if the amount of delinquent taxes is not paid, the tax receiver will, at
16 5 p.m. on the first Monday in June of the current year, issue a certificate
17 authorizing the county treasurer to hold the property. (NRS 361.5648) Section 2 of
-
*AB133_R2*

– 2 –
18 this bill provides instead that the notice of delinquency must state that if the amount
19 of delinquent taxes is not paid, the tax receiver will, at the close of business of the
20 tax receiver of the county on the first Monday in June of the current year, issue a
21 certificate authorizing the county treasurer to hold the property.
22 Existing law requires the tax receiver to make out a trustee’s certificate that
23 describes each property on which delinquent taxes, penalties, interest and costs
24 have not been paid. The trustee’s certificate authorizes the county treasurer to hold
25 each property for a certain period of time. (NRS 361.570) When the time allowed
26 by law for the redemption of a property described in the certificate has expired and
27 no redemption has been made, the tax receiver who issued the certificate is required
28 to execute and deliver to the county treasurer a deed of the property. Upon
29 obtaining such a deed, the county treasurer is required to hold the property in trust
30 until it is sold or otherwise disposed of. Existing law provides that during certain
31 periods or not later than 5 p.m. on the third business day before the day of the sale
32 by a county treasurer, certain persons are entitled to have the property reconveyed
33 upon the receipt by the county treasurer of payment of the delinquent taxes and
34 certain costs. (NRS 361.585) Section 3 of this bill provides instead that during
35 certain periods or not later than the close of business of the county treasurer on the
36 third business day before the day of the sale by a county treasurer, certain persons
37 are entitled to have the property reconveyed upon the receipt by the county
38 treasurer of payment of the delinquent taxes and certain costs.
39 Existing law authorizes, under certain circumstances, the county treasurer to
40 sell property held in trust because of delinquent taxes. Upon payment, the county
41 treasurer is required, with certain exceptions, to issue a quitclaim deed to the
42 purchaser. Existing law provides an exception to this requirement to issue a
43 quitclaim deed under certain circumstances, if, not later than 5 p.m. on the third
44 business day immediately preceding the day of the sale by the county treasurer, a
45 municipality provides the county treasurer with an affidavit that meets certain
46 requirements. (NRS 361.595) Section 4 of this bill provides instead that, under
47 certain circumstances, the county treasurer may not issue the quitclaim deed if, not
48 later than the close of business of the county treasurer on the third business day
49 immediately preceding the day of the sale by the county treasurer, a municipality
50 provides the county treasurer with an affidavit that meets certain requirements.
51 Under existing law, if the county treasurer sells property held in trust because
52 of delinquent taxes, the county treasurer is required to pay certain costs and taxes
53 from the excess proceeds from the sale and then pay into the county general fund:
54 (1) the first $300 of the excess proceeds; (2) 10 percent of the next $10,000 of the
55 excess proceeds; and (3) the amount remaining to be held separately for a certain
56 period of time, and if not claimed by certain persons who had a secured interest in
57 the property, then into the county general fund. (NRS 361.610) Section 5 of this
58 bill provides that of the amount remaining to be held separately for a certain period
59 of time, and if not claimed, 5 percent of the total amount remaining must be
60 accounted for separately in the county general fund pursuant to section 1.5 of this
61 bill. The money in the account is only authorized to be used to acquire technology
62 or improve technology used in the office of the county treasurer. Section 1.5 also
63 requires the county treasurer to submit an annual report to the board of county
64 commissioners by July 1 setting forth the projected expenditure of money in the
65 account for the following fiscal year. Section 1.5 also authorizes a board of county
66 commissioners to revert 50 percent of any balance of unexpended or unencumbered
67 money after 3 years.
68 Existing law sets forth certain procedures allowing a person to make a claim for
69 the excess proceeds from the sale by the county treasurer of property held in trust
70 because of delinquent taxes, including, without limitation, requiring certain
71 indeterminable claims to be submitted to mediation, and if mediation is
72 unsuccessful, then requiring the county treasurer to conduct a hearing or file an
-
*AB133_R2*

– 3 –
73 action for interpleader. (NRS 361.610) Section 5 eliminates conducting a hearing
74 as a method for determining certain indeterminable claims, instead requiring the
75 county treasurer to file an action for interpleader following any unsuccessful
76 mediation. Existing law authorizes a person to enter into an agreement to locate,
77 deliver, recover or assist in the recovery of excess proceeds by certain persons.
78 However, if the agreement is entered into by a natural person who occupied the
79 property as his or her primary residence at the time of the sale, any such agreement
80 must not provide for a fee of more than 10 percent of the remaining excess
81 proceeds due that person. (NRS 361.610) Section 5 removes the limitation that the
82 property must have been occupied by a natural person as his or her primary
83 residence at the time of sale and instead applies the 10 percent cap to the fee of: (1)
84 any natural person; and (2) certain persons who are otherwise authorized by power
85 of attorney, assignment or any other legal instrument by another person to file a
86 claim with and collect from the county treasurer any property owed to the person.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 245.040 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 245.040 1. Sheriffs, county recorders and county auditors,
3 county clerks, county assessors and county treasurers shall keep an
4 office at the county seat of their county which, except as otherwise
5 provided in subsections 3 and 4, must be kept open on all days
6 except Sundays and nonjudicial days from 9 a.m. to 12 m., and on
7 all days except Sundays, nonjudicial days and Saturdays from 1 p.m.
8 to 5 p.m. for the transaction of public business, but nothing
9 contained in this subsection interferes with a duty now required of a
10 public officer under the election laws of this State. County clerks
11 shall keep their offices open on all election days during the hours
12 when the polls are open for voting but may, with the consent of the
13 district judge of the county, close their offices for all purposes
14 except election business and the issuance of marriage licenses on
15 any day on which the primary or general election is held.
16 2. [Notwithstanding] Except as otherwise provided in
17 subsection 5 and notwithstanding the provisions of subsection 1,
18 the board of county commissioners of any county may, by an order
19 regularly made and entered in the records of its proceedings,
20 designate the days and hours during which the offices of the sheriff,
21 county recorder and county auditor, county clerk, county assessor
22 and county treasurer must be kept open for the transaction of public
23 business. An order so made and entered must require each office to
24 be kept open for not less than 40 hours during each week, and must
25 not prevent the county clerk from closing his or her office for all
26 purposes except election business and the issuance of marriage
27 licenses on primary and general election days as provided in
28 subsection 1.
-
*AB133_R2*

– 4 –
1 3. The board of county commissioners may authorize a county
2 officer to rent, equip and operate, at public expense, one or more
3 branch offices in the county. The branch office may be kept open for
4 the transaction of public business on the days and during the hours
5 specified in subsections 1 and 2 or on such days and during such
6 hours as determined by the board. The provisions of this subsection
7 do not preempt any other statutory provisions which require certain
8 duties to be performed at the county seat.
9 4. Any county office may deviate from the hours of operation
10 required pursuant to this section if the board of county
11 commissioners approves the plan for the deviation submitted by the
12 office, except that no such deviation may conflict with the election
13 laws of this State. Such a plan must be fiscally neutral or result in
14 cost savings.
15 5. The board of county commissioners of any county shall not
16 designate or approve the county office or branch offices, if any, of
17 the county treasurer to close earlier than 5 p.m. for the transaction
18 of business on any business day. Nothing in this subsection shall
19 be construed to prohibit the offices from closing later than 5 p.m.
20 6. A county officer who violates the provisions of this section
21 is guilty of a misdemeanor, and if an officer mentioned in
22 subsection 1 absents himself or herself from office, except:
23 (a) When called away from his or her office by official duties;
24 (b) When expressly permitted so to do by the board of county
25 commissioners or a majority of the members thereof in writing; or
26 (c) When he or she makes provision to leave his or her office
27 open for the transaction of public business on the days and during
28 the hours prescribed by this section and in charge of a deputy
29 qualified to act in the county officer’s absence,
30  there must be withheld from the county officer’s monthly salary
31 that proportion thereof as the number of days of absence bears to the
32 number of days of the month in which the absence occurs. The
33 money must be withheld from payment of salary to the officer for
34 the next succeeding month by order of the board of county
35 commissioners, but such an order must not be made without first
36 giving the officer affected reasonable notice and an opportunity to
37 appear before the board and defend the charge against him or her.
38 Sec. 1.5. Chapter 249 of NRS is hereby amended by adding
39 thereto a new section to read as follows:
40 1. Any money received by the county treasurer pursuant to
41 paragraph (a) of subsection 4 of NRS 361.610 must be accounted
42 for separately in the county general fund.
43 2. Money in the account:

11 year does not revert to the county general fund, and the balance in
12 the account must be carried forward to the next fiscal year.

14 funds are invested. All interest earned on the deposit or investment
15 of the money in the account, after deducting any applicable

17 account must be paid as other claims against the county are paid.
18 5. On or before July 1 of each year, the county treasurer shall
19 submit a report to the board of county commissioners setting forth
20 the projected expenditure of money in the account for the
21 following fiscal year.

– 8 –
1 particularly described therein, after giving notice of sale, for a total

4 3. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 4, notice of the
5 sale must specify the day, time and place of the sale and be:
6 (a) Posted in at least three public places in the county, including
7 one at the courthouse and one on the property, not less than 20 days
8 before the day of sale or, in lieu of such a posting, by publication of
9 the notice at least once a week for 4 consecutive weeks by four
10 weekly insertions in some newspaper published within the county,
11 the first publication being at least 22 days before the day of the sale,
12 if the board of county commissioners so directs.
13 (b) Mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, not less
14 than 90 days before the day of the sale, to the owner of the parcel as
15 shown on the tax roll and to any person or governmental entity that
16 appears in the records of the county to have a lien or other interest in
17 the property. If the receipt is returned unsigned, the county treasurer
18 must make a reasonable attempt to locate and notify the owner or
19 other person or governmental entity before the sale.
20 4. If, pursuant to NRS 361.567, the tax receiver has elected to
21 use an expedited procedure for the sale of the property and the
22 requirements of NRS 361.567 were met, notice of the sale must
23 specify the day, time and place of the sale and be:
24 (a) Posted in at least three public places in the county, including
25 one at the courthouse and one on the property, not less than 20 days
26 before the day of sale or, in lieu of such a posting, by publication of
27 the notice at least once a week for 4 consecutive weeks by four
28 weekly insertions in some newspaper published within the county,

38 5. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 6, the county
39 treasurer shall make, execute and deliver to any purchaser, upon
40 payment to the county treasurer, as trustee, of a consideration not
41 less than that specified in the order, a quitclaim deed, discharged of
42 any trust of the property mentioned in the order.
43 6. If, not later than [5 p.m.] the close of business of the county
44 treasurer on the third business day immediately preceding the day
45 of the sale by the county treasurer, a municipality provides the
-
*AB133_R2*

– 9 –
1 county treasurer with an affidavit signed by the treasurer of the
2 municipality stating that:
3 (a) The municipality sold the property or the property was
4 stricken off to the municipality pursuant to NRS 271.560; and
5 (b) A certificate of sale for the property was issued to the
6 purchaser pursuant to NRS 271.570 or to the municipality pursuant
7 to NRS 271.560,
8  the county treasurer may not issue the quitclaim deed described
9 in subsection 5 unless the person who purchased the property from
10 the county pays to the municipality any amount owed pursuant to
11 the certificate of sale issued pursuant to NRS 271.560 and 271.570
12 and the municipality provides an affidavit signed by the treasurer of
13 the municipality stating that such amounts have been paid. If the
14 purchaser does not pay the amount owed to the municipality within
15 20 days after the sale of the property by the county, the sale of the
16 property by the county is void and the county treasurer may retain
17 for administrative costs not more than 10 percent of the purchase
18 amount paid by the purchaser.
19 7. Before delivering a deed, the county treasurer shall record
20 the deed at the expense of the purchaser.
21 8. All deeds issued pursuant to this section, whether issued
22 before, on or after July 1, 1955, are primary evidence:
23 (a) Of the regularity of all proceedings relating to the order of
24 the board of county commissioners, the notice of sale and the sale of
25 the property;
26 (b) That if, pursuant to NRS 361.567, the tax receiver has
27 elected to use an expedited procedure for the sale of the property,
28 the property is abandoned; and
29 (c) That, if the real property was sold to pay taxes on personal
30 property, the real property belonged to the person liable to pay the
31 tax.
32 9. No deed may be executed and delivered by the county
33 treasurer until he or she files at the expense of the purchaser, with
34 the clerk of the board of county commissioners, proper affidavits of
35 posting and of publication of the notice of sale, as the case may be,
36 together with his or her return of sale, verified, showing compliance
37 with the order of the board of county commissioners, which
38 constitutes primary evidence of the facts recited therein.
39 10. If the deed when regularly issued is not recorded in the
40 office of the county recorder, the deed, and all proceedings relating
41 thereto, is void as against any subsequent purchaser in good faith
42 and for a valuable consideration of the same property, or any portion
43 thereof, when his or her own conveyance is first recorded.
44 11. The board of county commissioners shall provide its clerk
45 with a record book in which must be indexed the name of each
-
*AB133_R2*

– 10 –
1 purchaser, together with the date of sale, a description of the
2 property sold, a reference to the book and page of the minutes of the
3 board of county commissioners where the order of sale is recorded,
4 and the file number of the affidavits and return.
5 Sec. 5. NRS 361.610 is hereby amended to read as follows:
6 361.610 1. Out of the sale price or rents of any property of
7 which he or she is trustee, the county treasurer shall pay the costs
8 due any officer for the enforcement of the tax upon the parcel of
9 property and all taxes owing thereon, and upon the redemption of
10 any property from the county treasurer as trustee, he or she shall pay
11 the redemption money over to any officers having fees due them
12 from the parcels of property and pay the tax for which it was sold
13 and pay the redemption percentage according to the proportion those
14 fees respectively bear to the tax.
15 2. In no case may:
16 (a) Any service rendered by any officer under this chapter
17 become or be allowed as a charge against the county; or
18 (b) The sale price or rent or redemption money of any one parcel
19 of property be appropriated to pay any cost or tax upon any other
20 parcel of property than that so sold, rented or redeemed.
21 3. After paying all the tax and costs upon any one parcel of
22 property, the county treasurer shall pay into the general fund of the
23 county, from the excess proceeds of the sale:
24 (a) The first $300 of the excess proceeds; and
25 (b) Ten percent of the next $10,000 of the excess proceeds.
26 4. The amount remaining after the county treasurer has paid the
27 amounts required by subsection 3 must be deposited in an interest-
