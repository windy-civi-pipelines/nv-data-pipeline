AN ACT relating to chiropractic; enacting provisions relating to temporary
certificates for chiropractic assistants; revising provisions relating to
unprofessional conduct in the practice of chiropractic; revising the
membership of the Chiropractic Physicians’ Board of Nevada; revising
certain qualifications required to apply for a license as a chiropractic
physician or a certificate as a chiropractic assistant; revising certain
fees the Board may charge and collect; revising certain requirements
for student participation in a preceptor program; revising certain
requirements for certain cease and desist orders of the Board; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law regulates the practice of chiropractic in this State and provides for the
2 licensure of chiropractic physicians and the certification of chiropractic assistants. (Chapter
3 634 of NRS) Section 1 of this bill authorizes the Chiropractic Physicians’ Board of Nevada,
4 under certain circumstances, to issue a temporary certificate to practice as a chiropractic
5 assistant to a person who holds an existing license, certificate or registration in good standing
6 in another jurisdiction where the person resides. Section 1 provides that such a temporary
7 certificate is: (1) valid for 15 business days or less; (2) valid only under the supervision and
8 control of a chiropractic physician; and (3) not renewable, and the Board may grant not more
9 than two temporary certificates to a person during any calendar year. Section 1 authorizes the
10 Board to charge a reasonable fee, established by regulation of the Board, for each application
11 for a temporary certificate.
12 Existing law provides grounds for initiating disciplinary action against practitioners of
13 chiropractic. (NRS 634.018, 634.140) Section 2 of this bill makes employing a person as a
14 temporary chiropractic assistant if the person has not been issued a temporary certificate
15 pursuant to section 1 grounds for disciplinary action.
16 Existing law creates the Board, consisting of seven members, and requires the Governor
17 to appoint members with certain qualifications. (NRS 634.020) Section 3 of this bill revises
18 the membership of the Board by: (1) removing a requirement for the Governor to appoint one
19 member who represents the interests of persons or agencies that regularly provide health care
20 to patients who are indigent, uninsured or unable to afford health care; and (2) increasing from
21 four to five the number of chiropractic physicians the Governor is required to appoint.

Assembly Amendment No. 481 to Assembly Bill No. 513 Page 4
22 Existing law requires: (1) the Board to hold certain examinations prescribed by the Board
23 at least semiannually; and (2) examinations prescribed by the Board to include certain
24 subjects. Existing law also authorizes the Board to: (1) determine the form of such
25 examinations; and (2) include additional subjects on such examinations. (NRS 634.070)
26 Section 4 of this bill removes the requirements that such examinations be held semiannually
27 and contain certain subjects, and instead authorizes the Board to: (1) hold examinations
28 semiannually or at other intervals prescribed by the Board; and (2) determine the content of
29 such examinations. Section 5 of this bill requires an applicant for examination to submit to the
30 Board a statement which attests that the applicant has read, understood and will abide by the
31 provisions of existing law and regulations governing chiropractic physicians and providers of
32 health care. Sections 7 and 10 of this bill remove provisions establishing the minimum score
33 to pass the required examination. Section 7 additionally removes certain provisions governing
34 applicants who fail to pass the examination.
35 Sections 3, 5, 6 and 12 of this bill revise the educational requirements for licensure as a
36 chiropractic physician and for being appointed to the Board to specify that the required
37 education may be obtained through certain doctor of chiropractic degree programs.
38 Existing law authorizes the Board to specify the formal training which an applicant for a
39 certificate as a chiropractic assistant must complete, which must include at least 12 months of
40 study or the equivalent. (NRS 634.123) Section 8 of this bill removes the requirement to
41 include at least 12 months of training or the equivalent. [Existing law requires certain licenses
42 and certificates to be renewed biennially, on or before January 1. (NRS 634.130) Section 9 of
43 this bill instead requires renewal by the last day of the month in which the holder of the
44 license or certificate was born.]
45 Section 11 of this bill eliminates the authority of the Board to charge a fee for providing
46 to a person who is not licensed to practice chiropractic: (1) a list of persons who were licensed
47 to practice chiropractic following the most recent examination of the Board; (2) a copy of the
48 statutes, regulations and other rules governing the practice of chiropractic in this State; and (3)
49 a list of continuing education courses approved by the Board. Section 11 also expands the
50 applicability of an existing fee for a review by the Board of certain courses offered for
51 continuing education to include a review of a course offered to satisfy the requirements for the
52 qualifications to perform dry needling.
53 Section 12 revises certain requirements for a student to participate in a preceptor
54 program. Section 13 of this bill revises certain contact information which is required to be
55 included in certain cease and desist orders issued by the Board.
