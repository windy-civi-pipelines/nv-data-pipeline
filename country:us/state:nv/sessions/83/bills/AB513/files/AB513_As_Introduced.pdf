Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law regulates the practice of chiropractic in this State and provides for
2 the licensure of chiropractic physicians and the certification of chiropractic
3 assistants. (Chapter 634 of NRS) Section 1 of this bill authorizes the Chiropractic
4 Physicians’ Board of Nevada, under certain circumstances, to issue a temporary
5 certificate to practice as a chiropractic assistant to a person who holds an existing
6 license, certificate or registration in good standing in another jurisdiction where the
7 person resides. Section 1 provides that such a temporary certificate is: (1) valid for
8 15 business days or less; (2) valid only under the supervision and control of a
9 chiropractic physician; and (3) not renewable, and the Board may grant not more
10 than two temporary certificates to a person during any calendar year. Section 1
11 authorizes the Board to charge a reasonable fee, established by regulation of the
12 Board, for each application for a temporary certificate.

13 Existing law provides grounds for initiating disciplinary action against
14 practitioners of chiropractic. (NRS 634.018, 634.140) Section 2 of this bill makes
15 employing a person as a temporary chiropractic assistant if the person has not been
16 issued a temporary certificate pursuant to section 1 grounds for disciplinary action.
17 Existing law creates the Board, consisting of seven members, and requires the
18 Governor to appoint members with certain qualifications. (NRS 634.020) Section 3
19 of this bill revises the membership of the Board by: (1) removing a requirement for
20 the Governor to appoint one member who represents the interests of persons or
21 agencies that regularly provide health care to patients who are indigent, uninsured
22 or unable to afford health care; and (2) increasing from four to five the number of
23 chiropractic physicians the Governor is required to appoint.
24 Existing law requires: (1) the Board to hold certain examinations prescribed by
25 the Board at least semiannually; and (2) examinations prescribed by the Board to
26 include certain subjects. Existing law also authorizes the Board to: (1) determine
27 the form of such examinations; and (2) include additional subjects on such
28 examinations. (NRS 634.070) Section 4 of this bill removes the requirements that
29 such examinations be held semiannually and contain certain subjects, and instead
30 authorizes the Board to: (1) hold examinations semiannually or at other intervals
31 prescribed by the Board; and (2) determine the content of such examinations.
32 Section 5 of this bill requires an applicant for examination to submit to the Board a
33 statement which attests that the applicant has read, understood and will abide by the
34 provisions of existing law and regulations governing chiropractic physicians and
35 providers of health care. Sections 7 and 10 of this bill remove provisions
36 establishing the minimum score to pass the required examination. Section 7
37 additionally removes certain provisions governing applicants who fail to pass the
38 examination.
39 Sections 3, 5, 6 and 12 of this bill revise the educational requirements for
40 licensure as a chiropractic physician to specify that the required education may be
41 obtained through certain doctor of chiropractic degree programs.
42 Existing law authorizes the Board to specify the formal training which an
43 applicant for a certificate as a chiropractic assistant must complete, which must
44 include at least 12 months of study or the equivalent. (NRS 634.123) Section 8 of
45 this bill removes the requirement to include at least 12 months of training or the
46 equivalent. Existing law requires certain licenses and certificates to be renewed
47 biennially, on or before January 1. (NRS 634.130) Section 9 of this bill instead
48 requires renewal by the last day of the month in which the holder of the license or
49 certificate was born.
50 Section 11 of this bill eliminates the authority of the Board to charge a fee for
51 providing to a person who is not licensed to practice chiropractic: (1) a list of
52 persons who were licensed to practice chiropractic following the most recent
53 examination of the Board; (2) a copy of the statutes, regulations and other rules
54 governing the practice of chiropractic in this State; and (3) a list of continuing
55 education courses approved by the Board. Section 11 also expands the applicability
56 of an existing fee for a review by the Board of certain courses offered for
57 continuing education to include a review of a course offered to satisfy the
58 requirements for the qualifications to perform dry needling.
59 Section 12 revises certain requirements for a student to participate in a
60 preceptor program. Section 13 of this bill revises certain contact information which
61 is required to be included in certain cease and desist orders issued by the Board.
