Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing standing rules of the houses of Congress govern requests by members
2 of Congress for the inclusion of funding, known as “earmarks” or “congressionally
3 directed spending items,” in federal appropriation bills for projects that benefit
4 communities in the members’ districts. (See, e.g., Clause 9 of Rule No. XXI and
5 Clause 17 of Rule No. XXIII of the Standing Rules of the U.S. House of
6 Representatives, H.R. Res. 5, 119th Cong. (2025) and Rule No. XLIV of the
7 Standing Rules of the U.S. Senate, Pub. L. 110–81, 110th Cong. (2007))
8 Section 2 of this bill creates the Community Project Grant Program at the state
9 legislative level for the purpose of awarding grants to private nonprofit
10 organizations to conduct projects that benefit communities in Nevada. Section 2
11 requires that an application for such a grant be submitted by a Legislator on behalf
12 of a nonprofit organization for a project within the Legislator’s district. Section 2
13 further requires the Legislative Commission to adopt regulations to carry out the
14 Grant Program, including regulations that prescribe: (1) the categories of eligible
15 projects for which grants may be awarded under the Grant Program; (2) procedures
16 for the submission and review of applications for and the awarding of such a grant;
17 and (3) requirements for reporting expenditures of money from such a grant.
18 Existing law creates the Legislative Fund as a special revenue fund for the use
19 of the Legislature, and where specifically authorized by law, for the use of the
20 Legislative Counsel Bureau. (NRS 218A.150) Section 3 of this bill creates the
21 Account for the Community Project Grant Program in the Legislative Fund.
22 Section 3 requires that money in the Account be used only to carry out the
