EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to taxation; revising provisions governing partial
abatements of property taxes levied on certain residential
rental dwellings; providing for a partial abatement of the
property taxes levied on certain residential dwellings if
the owner of the dwelling does not impose certain fees or
restrictions on companion animals; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for a partial abatement of the property taxes levied on
2 certain residential rental dwellings if the amount of rent collected from each of the
3 tenants does not exceed the fair market rent for the county in which the dwelling is
4 located. (NRS 361.4724) Section 2 of this bill additionally provides for a partial
5 abatement of the property taxes levied on certain residential rental dwellings if the
6 owner does not impose: (1) a nonrefundable fee or additional rent related to
7 companion animals; (2) a limitation on the total number of companion animals with
8 which a tenant may reside, other than a limit imposed by the jurisdiction where the
9 property is located; or (3) breed or size restrictions on companion animals, except
10 for a prohibition against a particular companion animal that has been declared to be
11 dangerous or vicious. Section 2 limits the combined total amount of abatements
12 that may be provided to owners of residential rental dwellings that do not charge
13 rent that exceeds the fair market rent for the county in which the dwelling is located
14 and to owners of residential rental dwellings that do not impose fees, additional rent
15 or certain restrictions on companion animals to $10 million per year.
16 Section 1 of this bill provides that certain other abatements of property taxes
17 do not apply if the provisions of section 2 provide for a greater abatement.

9 of the ad valorem taxes levied in a county on that property each
10 fiscal year equal to the amount by which the product of the
11 combined rate of all ad valorem taxes levied in that county on the
12 property for that fiscal year and the amount of the assessed valuation
13 of the property which is taxable in that county for that fiscal year,
14 excluding any increase in the assessed valuation of the property

25 year,
26  whichever is greater; and
27 (b) A percentage of the amount determined pursuant to
28 paragraph (a) which is equal to:
29 (1) The greater of:

5 any remainder parcel of real property for which no assessed
6 valuation was separately established for the immediately preceding
7 fiscal year, is entitled to a partial abatement of the ad valorem taxes
8 levied in a county on that property for a fiscal year equal to the
9 amount by which the product of the combined rate of all ad valorem
10 taxes levied in that county on the property for that fiscal year and
11 the amount of the assessed valuation of the property which is
12 taxable in that county for that fiscal year, excluding any amount of
13 that assessed valuation attributable to any improvement to or change
14 in the actual or authorized use of the property that would not have
15 been included in the calculation of the assessed valuation of the
16 property for the immediately preceding fiscal year if an assessed
17 valuation had been separately established for that property for that
18 prior fiscal year, exceeds the sum obtained by adding:
19 (a) The amount of all the ad valorem taxes:
20 (1) Which would have been levied in that county on the
21 property for the immediately preceding fiscal year if an assessed
22 valuation had been separately established for that property for that

24 calculations and other factors and considerations that would have
25 been used for the valuation of that property for that prior fiscal year;
26 or
27 (2) Which would have been levied in that county on the
28 property for the immediately preceding fiscal year if an assessed
29 valuation had been separately established for that property for that
30 prior fiscal year based upon all the assumptions, costs, values,
31 calculations and other factors and considerations that would have
32 been used for the valuation of that property for that prior fiscal year,
33 and if not for any exemptions from taxation that applied to the
34 property for that prior fiscal year but do not apply to the property for

36  whichever is greater; and

*AB447*
– 4 –

2 Price Index for all Urban Consumers, U.S. City Average (All Items)
3 for the immediately preceding calendar year; or
4 (III) Zero; or
5 (2) Eight percent,

7 3. The provisions of subsection 1 do not apply to any property
8 for which the provisions of subsection 1 of NRS 361.4723 or
9 subsection 1 or 2 of NRS 361.4724 provide a greater abatement
10 from taxation.
11 4. Except as otherwise required to carry out the provisions of
12 NRS 361.4732 and any regulations adopted pursuant to NRS
13 361.4733, the amount of any reduction in the ad valorem taxes
14 levied in a county for a fiscal year as a result of the application of
15 the provisions of subsections 1 and 2 must be deducted from the
16 amount of ad valorem taxes each taxing entity would otherwise be
17 entitled to receive for that fiscal year in the same proportion as the
18 rate of ad valorem taxes levied in the county on the property by or
19 on behalf of that taxing entity for that fiscal year bears to the
20 combined rate of all ad valorem taxes levied in the county on the
21 property by or on behalf of all taxing entities for that fiscal year.
22 5. The Nevada Tax Commission shall adopt such regulations as
23 it deems appropriate to ensure that this section is carried out in a
24 uniform and equal manner.
25 6. For the purposes of this section, “remainder parcel of real
26 property” means a parcel of real property which remains after the
27 creation of new parcels of real property for development from one
28 or more existing parcels of real property, if the use of that remaining
29 parcel has not changed from the immediately preceding fiscal year.
30 Sec. 2. NRS 361.4724 is hereby amended to read as follows:
31 361.4724 1. The Legislature hereby finds and declares that
32 many Nevadans who cannot afford to own their own homes would
33 be adversely affected by large unanticipated increases in property
34 taxes, as those tax increases are passed down to renters in the form
35 of rent increases , and therefore the benefits of a charitable
36 exemption pursuant to subsection 8 of Section 1 of Article 10 of the
37 Nevada Constitution should be afforded to those Nevadans through
38 an abatement granted to the owners of residential rental dwellings
39 who charge rent that does not exceed affordable housing standards
40 for low-income housing. The Legislature therefore directs a partial
41 abatement of taxes for such owners as follows:
42 [1.] (a) Except as otherwise provided in or required to carry out
43 the provisions of [subsection 2] paragraph (b) and NRS 361.4725
44 to 361.4729, inclusive, if the amount of rent collected from each of
45 the tenants of a residential dwelling does not exceed the fair market
-
*AB447*
– 5 –
1 rent for the county in which the dwelling is located, as most recently
2 published by the United States Department of Housing and Urban
3 Development, the owner of the dwelling is entitled to a partial
4 abatement of the ad valorem taxes levied in a county on that
5 property for each fiscal year equal to the amount by which the
6 product of the combined rate of all ad valorem taxes levied in that
7 county on the property for that fiscal year and the amount of the
8 assessed valuation of the property which is taxable in that county for
9 that fiscal year, excluding any increase in the assessed valuation of
10 the property from the immediately preceding fiscal year as a result
11 of any improvement to or change in the actual or authorized use of
12 the property, exceeds the sum obtained by adding:
13 [(a)] (1) The amount of all the ad valorem taxes:
14 [(1)] (I) Levied in that county on the property for the
15 immediately preceding fiscal year; or
16 [(2)] (II) Which would have been levied in that county on the
17 property for the immediately preceding fiscal year if not for any
18 exemptions from taxation that applied to the property for that prior
19 fiscal year but do not apply to the property for the current fiscal
20 year,
21  whichever is greater; and
22 [(b)] (2) Three percent of the amount determined pursuant to
23 [paragraph (a).] subparagraph (1).
24 [2.] (b) The provisions of [subsection 1] paragraph (a) do not
25 apply to:
26 [(a)] (1) Any hotels, motels or other forms of transient lodging;
27 [(b)] (2) Any property for which no assessed valuation was
28 separately established for the immediately preceding fiscal year; and
29 [(c)] (3) Any property for which the provisions of subsection 1
30 of NRS 361.4722 provide a greater abatement from taxation.
31 2. The Legislature hereby finds and declares that many
32 Nevadans who own companion animals and who cannot afford
33 their own homes are severely limited in their options for housing
34 by increases in additional rent and other fees charged to a tenant
35 for owning and possessing companion animals, and therefore the
36 benefits of a charitable exemption pursuant to subsection 8 of
37 Section 1 of Article 10 of the Nevada Constitution should be
38 afforded to those Nevadans through an abatement granted to the
39 owners of residential rental dwellings who do not impose
40 additional rent or fees or certain restrictions relating to
41 companion animals. The Legislature therefore directs a partial
42 abatement of taxes for such owners as follows:
43 (a) Except as otherwise provided in or required to carry out the
44 provisions of paragraph (b), subsection 4 and NRS 361.4725 to
45 361.4729, inclusive, if the owner of a residential rental dwelling
-
*AB447*
– 6 –
1 does not impose upon the tenants of the residential rental dwelling
2 a nonrefundable fee or additional rent related to companion
3 animals residing in the residential rental dwelling, a limitation on
4 the total number of companion animals allowed to reside in the
5 residential rental dwelling, unless such a limitation is imposed by
6 the locality in which the residential rental dwelling is located, or
7 any restriction on the breed or size of a companion animal allowed
8 to reside in the residential rental dwelling, except for a prohibition
9 against a particular companion animal that has been declared to
10 be dangerous or vicious in accordance with NRS 202.500, the
11 owner is entitled to a partial abatement of the ad valorem taxes
12 levied in a county on that property for each fiscal year in an
13 amount equal to the lesser of:
14 (1) Seven thousand five hundred dollars; or
15 (2) The sum obtained by multiplying $750 for each unit
16 within the residential rental dwelling that satisfies the
17 requirements of this subsection by a fraction, the numerator of
18 which is the number of months during the immediately preceding
19 calendar year in which a companion animal was residing in the
20 unit on the first day of the month, and the denominator of which is
21 12.
22 (b) The provisions of paragraph (a) do not apply to any:
23 (1) Hotels, motels or other forms of transient lodging; or
24 (2) Property for which the provisions of subsection 1 of
25 NRS 361.4722 provide a greater abatement from taxation.
26 3. Nothing in the provisions of subsection 2 shall be
27 construed to prohibit:
28 (a) A tenant from being held liable for damage caused to any
29 premises or facility by a companion animal which resides in a
30 residential rental dwelling described in subsection 2; and
31 (b) An owner of a residential rental dwelling or his or her
32 employee or agent from requiring a tenant who owns and
33 maintains a companion animal to remove the companion animal
34 from the residential rental dwelling if the companion animal:
35 (1) Is out of control and the renter does not take effective
36 action to control the animal;
37 (2) Is not able to control its excretion of urine or feces; or
38 (3) Poses a direct threat to the health and safety of others
39 and making a reasonable accommodation or providing alternative
40 policies, practices or procedures is insufficient to eliminate or
41 reduce the threat to an acceptable level.
42 4. The total abatements provided by this section must not
43 exceed $10 million per year.
44 5. Except as otherwise required to carry out the provisions
45 of NRS 361.4732 and any regulations adopted pursuant to
-
*AB447*
– 7 –
1 NRS 361.4733, the amount of any reduction in the ad valorem taxes
2 levied in a county for a fiscal year as a result of the application of
3 the provisions of subsection 1 or 2 must be deducted from the
4 amount of ad valorem taxes each taxing entity would otherwise be
5 entitled to receive for that fiscal year in the same proportion as the
6 rate of ad valorem taxes levied in the county on the property by or
7 on behalf of that taxing entity for that fiscal year bears to the
8 combined rate of all ad valorem taxes levied in the county on the
9 property by or on behalf of all taxing entities for that fiscal year.
10 [4.] 6. The Nevada Tax Commission shall adopt such
11 regulations as it deems appropriate to carry out this section.
12 7. As used in this section, “companion animal” means a
13 domesticated animal owned or possessed by a person for the
14 purpose of pleasure or companionship, including, without
15 limitation, a cat or dog.
16 Sec. 3. NRS 361.47285 is hereby amended to read as follows:
17 361.47285 1. Notwithstanding the provisions of NRS
18 361.4722, 361.4723 and 361.4724, if a single-family residence that
19 is the primary residence of the owner is partially or completely
20 destroyed by a flood, fire, earthquake or other event for which a
21 state of emergency or declaration of disaster was proclaimed by the
22 Governor pursuant to NRS 414.070 and if, pursuant to NRS
23 361.084, the owner of the single-family residence is granted an
24 exemption of a portion of the assessed value of the single-family
25 residence, then for the purpose of calculating the amount of any
26 partial abatement to which the owner of the single-family residence
27 is entitled pursuant to NRS 361.4722, 361.4723 or 361.4724 for the
28 initial fiscal year for which the exemption applies, the amount
29 determined for the immediately preceding fiscal year pursuant to
30 paragraph (a) of subsection 1 of NRS 361.4722, paragraph (a) of
31 subsection 2 of NRS 361.4722, paragraph (a) of subsection 1 of
32 NRS 361.4723 or subparagraph (1) of paragraph (a) of subsection 1
33 of NRS 361.4724, as applicable, must be the amount determined for
34 the fiscal year in which the single-family residence was partially or
35 completely destroyed.
36 2. Notwithstanding the provisions of NRS 361.4722, 361.4723
37 and 361.4724, if, pursuant to NRS 361.084, the owner of a single-
38 family residence is granted an exemption of a portion of the
39 assessed value of the single-family residence and, after the granting
40 of the exemption, the single-family residence is sold or transferred
41 in a transaction to which the provisions of chapter 375 of NRS
42 apply, then for the purpose of calculating the amount of any partial
43 abatement to which the owner of the single-family residence is
44 entitled pursuant to NRS 361.4722, 361.4723 or 361.4724 for the
45 first fiscal year immediately following the sale or transfer of the
-
*AB447*
– 8 –
1 single-family residence, the owner is entitled only to a partial
2 abatement from taxation provided pursuant to NRS 361.4722,
3 361.4723 or 361.4724 in an amount equal to the amount of such a
4 partial abatement to which the owner would have been entitled if the
5 exemption were not granted and the provisions of subsection 1 were
6 not applied.
7 3. As used in this section:
8 (a) “Primary residence of the owner” has the meaning ascribed
9 to it in NRS 361.4723.
10 (b) “Single-family residence” has the meaning ascribed to it in
11 NRS 361.4723.
12 Sec. 4. NRS 361.4729 is hereby amended to read as follows:
13 361.4729 If the taxable value of an improvement to real
14 property is reduced as a result of:
15 1. The partial or complete destruction or removal of the
16 improvement; or
17 2. The correction pursuant to NRS 361.768 of an
18 overassessment of the improvement because of a factual error,
19  then for the purpose of calculating the amount of any partial
20 abatement to which the owner of the real property is entitled
21 pursuant to NRS 361.4722, 361.4723 or 361.4724 for the initial
22 fiscal year for which that reduction in taxable value applies, the
23 amount determined for the immediately preceding fiscal year
24 pursuant to paragraph (a) of subsection 1 of NRS 361.4722,
25 paragraph (a) of subsection 2 of NRS 361.4722, paragraph (a) of
26 subsection 1 of NRS 361.4723 or subparagraph (1) of paragraph (a)
27 of subsection 1 of NRS 361.4724, as applicable, must be reduced by
28 the same percentage as the taxable value of the real property is
29 reduced for that initial fiscal year as a result of the partial or
30 complete destruction or removal of the improvement to the property
31 or the correction of the overassessment of the improvement to the
32 property.
33 Sec. 5. NRS 361.4732 is hereby amended to read as follows:
34 361.4732 Except as otherwise required to carry out the
35 provisions of NRS 361.4729 and any regulations adopted pursuant
36 to NRS 361.4733, and notwithstanding any other provision of NRS
37 361.471 to 361.4735, inclusive, to the contrary, after a parcel or
38 other taxable unit of real property is annexed to a taxing entity:
39 1. The amount otherwise required to be determined pursuant to
40 paragraph (a) of subsection 1 of NRS 361.4722, paragraph (a) of
41 subsection 2 of NRS 361.4722, paragraph (a) of subsection 1 of
42 NRS 361.4723 or subparagraph (1) of paragraph (a) of subsection 1
43 of NRS 361.4724 with respect to that property for the first fiscal
44 year in which that taxing entity is entitled to levy or require the levy
45 on its behalf of any ad valorem taxes on the property as a result of
-
*AB447*
– 9 –
1 that annexation of the property, shall be deemed to be the amount of
2 ad valorem taxes which would have been levied on the property for
3 the immediately preceding fiscal year if the annexation had occurred
4 1 year earlier, based upon the tax rates that would have applied to
5 the property for the immediately preceding fiscal year if the
6 annexation had occurred 1 year earlier and without regard to any
7 exemptions from taxation that applied to the property for the
8 immediately preceding fiscal year but do not apply to the property
9 for the current fiscal year; and
10 2. For the purposes of any other calculations required pursuant
11 to the provisions of NRS 361.471 to 361.4735, inclusive, the

16 of the property, shall be deemed to be the combined overlapping tax
17 rate that would have applied to the property for that year if the

1 Existing law provides for a partial abatement of the property taxes levied on
2 certain residential rental dwellings if the amount of rent collected from each of the
3 tenants does not exceed the fair market rent for the county in which the dwelling is
4 located. (NRS 361.4724) Section 2 of this bill additionally provides for a partial
5 abatement of the property taxes levied on certain residential rental dwellings if the
6 owner does not impose: (1) a nonrefundable fee or additional rent related to
7 companion animals; (2) a limitation on the total number of companion animals with
8 which a tenant may reside, other than a limit imposed by the jurisdiction where the
9 property is located; or (3) breed or size restrictions on companion animals, except
10 for a prohibition against a particular companion animal that has been declared to be
11 dangerous or vicious. Section 2 limits the combined total amount of abatements
12 that may be provided to owners of residential rental dwellings that do not charge
13 rent that exceeds the fair market rent for the county in which the dwelling is located
14 and to owners of residential rental dwellings that do not impose fees, additional rent
15 or certain restrictions on companion animals to $10 million per year.
16 Section 1 of this bill provides that certain other abatements of property taxes
17 do not apply if the provisions of section 2 provide for a greater abatement.

6 valuation was separately established for the immediately preceding

9 amount by which the product of the combined rate of all ad valorem
10 taxes levied in that county on the property for that fiscal year and
11 the amount of the assessed valuation of the property which is
12 taxable in that county for that fiscal year, excluding any amount of
13 that assessed valuation attributable to any improvement to or change
14 in the actual or authorized use of the property that would not have
15 been included in the calculation of the assessed valuation of the

19 (a) The amount of all the ad valorem taxes:
20 (1) Which would have been levied in that county on the

25 been used for the valuation of that property for that prior fiscal year;
26 or
27 (2) Which would have been levied in that county on the
28 property for the immediately preceding fiscal year if an assessed
29 valuation had been separately established for that property for that

2 Price Index for all Urban Consumers, U.S. City Average (All Items)
3 for the immediately preceding calendar year; or
4 (III) Zero; or

7 3. The provisions of subsection 1 do not apply to any property
8 for which the provisions of subsection 1 of NRS 361.4723 or
9 subsection 1 or 2 of NRS 361.4724 provide a greater abatement
10 from taxation.
11 4. Except as otherwise required to carry out the provisions of
12 NRS 361.4732 and any regulations adopted pursuant to NRS
13 361.4733, the amount of any reduction in the ad valorem taxes
14 levied in a county for a fiscal year as a result of the application of
15 the provisions of subsections 1 and 2 must be deducted from the
16 amount of ad valorem taxes each taxing entity would otherwise be
17 entitled to receive for that fiscal year in the same proportion as the
18 rate of ad valorem taxes levied in the county on the property by or
19 on behalf of that taxing entity for that fiscal year bears to the
20 combined rate of all ad valorem taxes levied in the county on the
21 property by or on behalf of all taxing entities for that fiscal year.
22 5. The Nevada Tax Commission shall adopt such regulations as
23 it deems appropriate to ensure that this section is carried out in a
24 uniform and equal manner.
25 6. For the purposes of this section, “remainder parcel of real
26 property” means a parcel of real property which remains after the
27 creation of new parcels of real property for development from one
28 or more existing parcels of real property, if the use of that remaining
29 parcel has not changed from the immediately preceding fiscal year.
30 Sec. 2. NRS 361.4724 is hereby amended to read as follows:
31 361.4724 1. The Legislature hereby finds and declares that
32 many Nevadans who cannot afford to own their own homes would
33 be adversely affected by large unanticipated increases in property
34 taxes, as those tax increases are passed down to renters in the form
35 of rent increases , and therefore the benefits of a charitable
36 exemption pursuant to subsection 8 of Section 1 of Article 10 of the
37 Nevada Constitution should be afforded to those Nevadans through
38 an abatement granted to the owners of residential rental dwellings
39 who charge rent that does not exceed affordable housing standards
40 for low-income housing. The Legislature therefore directs a partial
41 abatement of taxes for such owners as follows:
42 [1.] (a) Except as otherwise provided in or required to carry out
43 the provisions of [subsection 2] paragraph (b) and NRS 361.4725
44 to 361.4729, inclusive, if the amount of rent collected from each of
45 the tenants of a residential dwelling does not exceed the fair market
-
*AB447*

– 5 –
1 rent for the county in which the dwelling is located, as most recently
2 published by the United States Department of Housing and Urban
3 Development, the owner of the dwelling is entitled to a partial
4 abatement of the ad valorem taxes levied in a county on that
5 property for each fiscal year equal to the amount by which the
6 product of the combined rate of all ad valorem taxes levied in that
7 county on the property for that fiscal year and the amount of the
8 assessed valuation of the property which is taxable in that county for
9 that fiscal year, excluding any increase in the assessed valuation of
10 the property from the immediately preceding fiscal year as a result
11 of any improvement to or change in the actual or authorized use of
12 the property, exceeds the sum obtained by adding:
13 [(a)] (1) The amount of all the ad valorem taxes:
14 [(1)] (I) Levied in that county on the property for the
15 immediately preceding fiscal year; or
16 [(2)] (II) Which would have been levied in that county on the
17 property for the immediately preceding fiscal year if not for any
18 exemptions from taxation that applied to the property for that prior
19 fiscal year but do not apply to the property for the current fiscal
20 year,
21  whichever is greater; and
22 [(b)] (2) Three percent of the amount determined pursuant to
23 [paragraph (a).] subparagraph (1).
24 [2.] (b) The provisions of [subsection 1] paragraph (a) do not
25 apply to:
26 [(a)] (1) Any hotels, motels or other forms of transient lodging;
27 [(b)] (2) Any property for which no assessed valuation was
28 separately established for the immediately preceding fiscal year; and
29 [(c)] (3) Any property for which the provisions of subsection 1
30 of NRS 361.4722 provide a greater abatement from taxation.
31 2. The Legislature hereby finds and declares that many
32 Nevadans who own companion animals and who cannot afford
33 their own homes are severely limited in their options for housing
34 by increases in additional rent and other fees charged to a tenant
35 for owning and possessing companion animals, and therefore the
36 benefits of a charitable exemption pursuant to subsection 8 of
37 Section 1 of Article 10 of the Nevada Constitution should be
38 afforded to those Nevadans through an abatement granted to the
39 owners of residential rental dwellings who do not impose
40 additional rent or fees or certain restrictions relating to
41 companion animals. The Legislature therefore directs a partial
42 abatement of taxes for such owners as follows:
43 (a) Except as otherwise provided in or required to carry out the
44 provisions of paragraph (b), subsection 4 and NRS 361.4725 to
45 361.4729, inclusive, if the owner of a residential rental dwelling
-
*AB447*

– 6 –
1 does not impose upon the tenants of the residential rental dwelling
2 a nonrefundable fee or additional rent related to companion
3 animals residing in the residential rental dwelling, a limitation on
4 the total number of companion animals allowed to reside in the
5 residential rental dwelling, unless such a limitation is imposed by
6 the locality in which the residential rental dwelling is located, or
7 any restriction on the breed or size of a companion animal allowed
8 to reside in the residential rental dwelling, except for a prohibition
9 against a particular companion animal that has been declared to
10 be dangerous or vicious in accordance with NRS 202.500, the
11 owner is entitled to a partial abatement of the ad valorem taxes
12 levied in a county on that property for each fiscal year in an
13 amount equal to the lesser of:
14 (1) Seven thousand five hundred dollars; or
15 (2) The sum obtained by multiplying $750 for each unit
16 within the residential rental dwelling that satisfies the
17 requirements of this subsection by a fraction, the numerator of
18 which is the number of months during the immediately preceding
19 calendar year in which a companion animal was residing in the
20 unit on the first day of the month, and the denominator of which is
21 12.
22 (b) The provisions of paragraph (a) do not apply to any:
23 (1) Hotels, motels or other forms of transient lodging; or
24 (2) Property for which the provisions of subsection 1 of
25 NRS 361.4722 provide a greater abatement from taxation.
26 3. Nothing in the provisions of subsection 2 shall be
27 construed to prohibit:
28 (a) A tenant from being held liable for damage caused to any
29 premises or facility by a companion animal which resides in a
30 residential rental dwelling described in subsection 2; and
31 (b) An owner of a residential rental dwelling or his or her
32 employee or agent from requiring a tenant who owns and
33 maintains a companion animal to remove the companion animal
34 from the residential rental dwelling if the companion animal:
35 (1) Is out of control and the renter does not take effective
36 action to control the animal;
37 (2) Is not able to control its excretion of urine or feces; or
38 (3) Poses a direct threat to the health and safety of others
39 and making a reasonable accommodation or providing alternative
40 policies, practices or procedures is insufficient to eliminate or
41 reduce the threat to an acceptable level.
42 4. The total abatements provided by this section must not
43 exceed $10 million per year.
44 5. Except as otherwise required to carry out the provisions
45 of NRS 361.4732 and any regulations adopted pursuant to
-
*AB447*

– 7 –
1 NRS 361.4733, the amount of any reduction in the ad valorem taxes
2 levied in a county for a fiscal year as a result of the application of
3 the provisions of subsection 1 or 2 must be deducted from the
4 amount of ad valorem taxes each taxing entity would otherwise be
5 entitled to receive for that fiscal year in the same proportion as the
6 rate of ad valorem taxes levied in the county on the property by or
7 on behalf of that taxing entity for that fiscal year bears to the
8 combined rate of all ad valorem taxes levied in the county on the
9 property by or on behalf of all taxing entities for that fiscal year.
10 [4.] 6. The Nevada Tax Commission shall adopt such
11 regulations as it deems appropriate to carry out this section.
12 7. As used in this section, “companion animal” means a
13 domesticated animal owned or possessed by a person for the
14 purpose of pleasure or companionship, including, without
15 limitation, a cat or dog.
16 Sec. 3. NRS 361.47285 is hereby amended to read as follows:
17 361.47285 1. Notwithstanding the provisions of NRS
18 361.4722, 361.4723 and 361.4724, if a single-family residence that
19 is the primary residence of the owner is partially or completely
20 destroyed by a flood, fire, earthquake or other event for which a
21 state of emergency or declaration of disaster was proclaimed by the
22 Governor pursuant to NRS 414.070 and if, pursuant to NRS
23 361.084, the owner of the single-family residence is granted an
24 exemption of a portion of the assessed value of the single-family
25 residence, then for the purpose of calculating the amount of any
26 partial abatement to which the owner of the single-family residence
27 is entitled pursuant to NRS 361.4722, 361.4723 or 361.4724 for the
28 initial fiscal year for which the exemption applies, the amount
29 determined for the immediately preceding fiscal year pursuant to
30 paragraph (a) of subsection 1 of NRS 361.4722, paragraph (a) of
31 subsection 2 of NRS 361.4722, paragraph (a) of subsection 1 of
32 NRS 361.4723 or subparagraph (1) of paragraph (a) of subsection 1
33 of NRS 361.4724, as applicable, must be the amount determined for
34 the fiscal year in which the single-family residence was partially or
35 completely destroyed.
36 2. Notwithstanding the provisions of NRS 361.4722, 361.4723
37 and 361.4724, if, pursuant to NRS 361.084, the owner of a single-
38 family residence is granted an exemption of a portion of the
39 assessed value of the single-family residence and, after the granting
40 of the exemption, the single-family residence is sold or transferred
41 in a transaction to which the provisions of chapter 375 of NRS
42 apply, then for the purpose of calculating the amount of any partial
43 abatement to which the owner of the single-family residence is
44 entitled pursuant to NRS 361.4722, 361.4723 or 361.4724 for the
45 first fiscal year immediately following the sale or transfer of the
-
*AB447*

– 8 –
1 single-family residence, the owner is entitled only to a partial
2 abatement from taxation provided pursuant to NRS 361.4722,
3 361.4723 or 361.4724 in an amount equal to the amount of such a
4 partial abatement to which the owner would have been entitled if the
5 exemption were not granted and the provisions of subsection 1 were
6 not applied.
7 3. As used in this section:
8 (a) “Primary residence of the owner” has the meaning ascribed
9 to it in NRS 361.4723.
10 (b) “Single-family residence” has the meaning ascribed to it in
11 NRS 361.4723.
12 Sec. 4. NRS 361.4729 is hereby amended to read as follows:
13 361.4729 If the taxable value of an improvement to real
14 property is reduced as a result of:
15 1. The partial or complete destruction or removal of the
16 improvement; or
17 2. The correction pursuant to NRS 361.768 of an
18 overassessment of the improvement because of a factual error,
19  then for the purpose of calculating the amount of any partial
20 abatement to which the owner of the real property is entitled
21 pursuant to NRS 361.4722, 361.4723 or 361.4724 for the initial
22 fiscal year for which that reduction in taxable value applies, the
23 amount determined for the immediately preceding fiscal year

25 paragraph (a) of subsection 2 of NRS 361.4722, paragraph (a) of
26 subsection 1 of NRS 361.4723 or subparagraph (1) of paragraph (a)
27 of subsection 1 of NRS 361.4724, as applicable, must be reduced by
28 the same percentage as the taxable value of the real property is
29 reduced for that initial fiscal year as a result of the partial or
30 complete destruction or removal of the improvement to the property
31 or the correction of the overassessment of the improvement to the
32 property.
33 Sec. 5. NRS 361.4732 is hereby amended to read as follows:
34 361.4732 Except as otherwise required to carry out the

44 year in which that taxing entity is entitled to levy or require the levy
45 on its behalf of any ad valorem taxes on the property as a result of
-
*AB447*

– 9 –
1 that annexation of the property, shall be deemed to be the amount of
2 ad valorem taxes which would have been levied on the property for
3 the immediately preceding fiscal year if the annexation had occurred
4 1 year earlier, based upon the tax rates that would have applied to
5 the property for the immediately preceding fiscal year if the
6 annexation had occurred 1 year earlier and without regard to any
7 exemptions from taxation that applied to the property for the
8 immediately preceding fiscal year but do not apply to the property
9 for the current fiscal year; and
10 2. For the purposes of any other calculations required pursuant
11 to the provisions of NRS 361.471 to 361.4735, inclusive, the

16 of the property, shall be deemed to be the combined overlapping tax
17 rate that would have applied to the property for that year if the
