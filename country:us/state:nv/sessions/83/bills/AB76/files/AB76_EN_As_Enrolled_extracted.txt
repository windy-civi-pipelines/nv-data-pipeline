Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of persons and
establishments involved in the cannabis industry in this State by the Cannabis
Compliance Board. (Title 56 of NRS) Existing law sets forth procedures by which
the Board may take disciplinary action against a licensee or registrant. (NRS
678A.500-678A.600) Under existing law, the Executive Director of the Board is
authorized to transmit the details of any suspected violation of the provisions of
existing law and regulations that govern the medical and adult use of cannabis to
the Attorney General for an investigation. (NRS 678A.500) After the investigation,
existing law requires the Board to determine whether to proceed with disciplinary
action against a licensee or registrant. (NRS 678A.510) If the Board proceeds with
disciplinary action, existing law: (1) requires the Board or the Executive Director to
serve a complaint upon the respondent; and (2) sets forth procedures for the
conduct of a disciplinary hearing before the Board. (NRS 678A.520-678A.590) If
the Board determines that a licensee or registrant has violated a provision of
existing law or regulations governing the medical and adult use of cannabis,
existing law authorizes the Board to impose certain penalties against the licensee or
registrant. (NRS 678A.600)

Section 2:
Sections 6 and 13-24 of this bill revise the procedures by which disciplinary
action may be taken against a licensee or registrant. Section 13 specifies that the
Executive Director is authorized to transmit the details of a suspected violation to
the Attorney General for further investigation. Section 24 makes a conforming
change to reflect the fact that an investigation of a violation is commenced by the
Executive Director, rather than the Board. Section 14 revises the actions the Board
must take with respect to each complaint resulting in an investigation by the
Attorney General. Section 15 revises the required content of a complaint served by
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 2 –
the Board or the Executive Director and the time in which the respondent may
answer the complaint. Upon receipt of an answer demanding a hearing or the
expiration of the time to answer the complaint, section 15 requires the Board to
assign the matter to a hearing officer. Sections 15-23 require a disciplinary hearing
to be heard before a hearing officer, rather than the Board, and revise procedures
for the conduct of such a hearing. Section 6: (1) provides that the decision and
order of a hearing officer is final unless a party aggrieved by the decision requests
that the Board review the decision and order or the Board initiates such a review on
its own motion; and (2) sets forth procedures for the conduct of a review by the
Board. Section 23 provides that any person aggrieved by a final decision or order
of the Board after a review conducted pursuant to section 6 is entitled to judicial
review of the decision or order.

Section 3:
Section 5 of this bill requires the Board to appoint one or more hearing officers
to conduct disciplinary hearings and render decisions.

Section 4:
Section 26 of this bill authorizes the Board, the Executive Director or a
designee of the Executive Director to issue a letter of warning, a letter of concern or
a nonpunitive admonishment under certain circumstances.
Existing law requires the Board to adopt regulations providing for the
investigation of unlicensed cannabis activities and the imposition of penalties
against persons who engage in such activities. (NRS 678A.450) Section 11 of this
bill authorizes the Board to issue summonses and subpoenas and to take certain
other actions in connection with such an investigation.

Section 5:
Sections 4, 12 and 54 of this bill revise provisions relating to the
confidentiality of certain information obtained by the Board. Existing law
authorizes the Governor or his or her designee to enter into one or more agreements
with tribal governments concerning cannabis. (NRS 223.250) Sections 52 and 53
of this bill provide that certain information received by a governmental entity from
a tribal government or a facility engaged in cannabis activities operating on tribal
land pursuant to the terms of such an agreement remains the property of the tribal
government, does not constitute a public record and must be kept confidential by
the governmental entity.

Section 6:
Sections 2, 7, 33, 34, 37 and 38 of this bill establish a standardized definition
of the term “local governmental jurisdiction” for the purposes of provisions
governing the medical and adult use of cannabis.
Existing law authorizes the Board to adopt regulations setting forth
requirements relating to the packaging and labeling of cannabis and cannabis
products. (NRS 678A.450) Section 11 prohibits those requirements from requiring:
(1) a package of cannabis or cannabis products which is sold at wholesale to
contain any label or tag other than a label or tag necessary for the functionality of
any computer software used for the seed-to-sale tracking of cannabis; and (2) a
cannabis establishment to include any information on the label for any cannabis or
a cannabis product that is already included on the packaging of the cannabis or
cannabis product. Sections 1.5 and 2.5 of this bill define the terms “label” and
“packaging” for the purposes of provisions of existing law governing the medical
and adult use of cannabis.
Existing law prohibits the production, distribution and sale of any synthetic
cannabinoid. (NRS 453.572, 557.255, 678B.525) Section 10 of this bill revises the
definition of “synthetic cannabinoid” to: (1) specify that any cannabinoid that is
either produced artificially or not obtained directly without the use of a chemical
reagent from a plant of the genus Cannabis constitutes a synthetic cannabinoid; and
(2) exclude THC produced using certain processes.
Existing law requires a cannabis establishment to use an inventory control
system. (NRS 678B.210, 678B.250, 678C.430) Existing law sets forth certain
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 3 –
requirements for the operation of such a system by a medical cannabis
establishment. (NRS 678C.430) Sections 27, 31, 32, 35 and 45 of this bill revise
those requirements and additionally apply the requirements to the operation of such
a system by an adult-use cannabis establishment. Sections 45 and 49 of this bill
revise requirements for a dual licensee concerning the reporting of inventory.
Existing law sets forth procedures by which a health authority, upon finding a
condition in the operation of a food establishment constituting a substantial hazard
to the public health, may issue an order to the holder of the permit to operate the
food establishment that may require the immediate suspension of the permit and
discontinuance of all food operations. (NRS 446.880) Section 30 of this bill sets
forth similar procedures by which an agent of the Board may issue such an order to
the holder of a cannabis establishment license if the agent finds a condition in the
operation of the cannabis establishment which constitutes a substantial hazard to
the public health. Section 30 sets forth certain conditions under which such an
order may not order the immediate suspension of the license and the immediate
discontinuance of the operations of the cannabis establishment. Section 29 of this
bill defines “substantial hazard to the public health” to include certain specified
conditions. Section 29 additionally requires the Board to adopt certain regulations
concerning substantial hazards to the public health which may exist at a cannabis
establishment.
Existing law requires an applicant for a medical cannabis establishment license
or adult-use cannabis establishment license to submit to the Board the physical
address of the proposed cannabis establishment, which, among other requirements,
must not be within a certain distance of a public or private school or community
facility. (NRS 678B.210, 678B.250) Sections 32 and 35 establish definitions of
“public school” and “private school” and revise the definition of “community
facility.”

Section 7:
Section 36 of this bill revises certain requirements for cannabis independent
testing laboratories.
Existing law deems the issuance of a license by the Board to be conditional in
certain local governmental jurisdictions until the cannabis establishment is in
compliance with applicable local governmental ordinances or rules and the local
government has issued a business license for the operation of the establishment.
(NRS 678B.320) Section 37 additionally deems the issuance of such a license to be
conditional until the cannabis establishment satisfies an inspection conducted by
the Board.

Section 8:
Section 39 of this bill revises the procedures that the operating documents of a
cannabis establishment are required to include to additionally include certain
procedures relating to the training of cannabis establishment agents and other
procedures established by the Board by regulation. (NRS 678B.510)

Section 9:
Section 40 of this bill revises certain restrictions on advertising engaged in and
packaging used by a cannabis establishment.
Existing law prohibits a person from selling, offering to sell, appearing to sell
or advertising the sale of cannabis or cannabis products unless the person holds an
adult-use cannabis establishment license or medical cannabis establishment license.
(NRS 678B.530) Section 41 of this bill prohibits those actions only if the person
does not have the appropriate type of license and additionally prohibits a person
from advertising as a cannabis sales facility or cannabis consumption lounge
without the appropriate type of license.
Existing law exempts an employee of the State Department of Agriculture from
state prosecution for certain offenses relating to cannabis under certain
circumstances. (NRS 678B.600) Section 42 of this bill expands that exemption to
-
83rd Session (2025)
– 4 –
also include an employee of the Board and an attorney who represents the
Department or the Board.
Existing law provides an exemption from state prosecution for the possession,
delivery and production of cannabis for: (1) a person who holds a valid registry
identification card or letter of approval; and (2) a person who is 21 years of age or
older. However, under existing law, that exemption is subject to certain limitations.
For example, with respect to usable cannabis, the exemption applies only to the
extent that a person does not, at any one time, possess, deliver or produce more
than 2.5 ounces of usable cannabis. (NRS 678C.200, 678D.200) Existing law also
prohibits a cannabis sales facility from selling to a person, in any one transaction,
more than 2.5 ounces of usable cannabis. (NRS 678B.550) Sections 3, 7 and 56 of
this bill revise the definition of “usable cannabis” to exclude the seeds of a plant of
the genus plant Cannabis and apply this definition throughout the provisions
of existing law governing the medical and adult use of cannabis. Section 47 of this
bill makes a conforming change to eliminate a reference to a provision that has
been repealed in section 56.
Existing law requires a medical cannabis establishment to maintain an
electronic verification system. (NRS 678B.210, 678C.420) Section 9 of this bill
changes the name of such a system to an electronic verification and authentication
system. Section 44 of this bill revises requirements concerning the operation of
such a system.
Existing law requires an adult-use cannabis product to be sold in a single
package. (NRS 678D.420) Section 48 of this bill revises requirements concerning
the amount of usable cannabis, concentrated cannabis or THC that a single package
may contain.
Existing law, with certain exceptions, prohibits smoking in any form within
indoor places of employment. (NRS 202.2483) Section 51 of this bill clarifies that
the smoking of cannabis in a cannabis consumption lounge in accordance with the
provisions of existing law governing the medical and adult-use of cannabis is not
prohibited.

Section 10:
Section 54.3 of this bill requires the Cannabis Advisory Commission to create a
subcommittee to conduct a study concerning certain matters relating to sales of
consumable hemp products in this State. Section 54.7 of this bill additionally
requires the Commission to create a subcommittee to conduct a study concerning

and subsection 3, notwithstanding any provision of law that has
declared a public book or record, or a part thereof, to be
confidential, if a public book or record has been in the legal custody
or control of one or more governmental entities for at least 30 years,
a person may apply to the district court of the county in which the
governmental entity that currently has legal custody or control of the
public book or record is located for an order directing that
governmental entity to allow the person to inspect or copy the public

Section 207:
2. There is a rebuttable presumption that a person who applies
for an order as described in subsection 1 is entitled to inspect or
copy the public book or record, or a part thereof, that the person
seeks to inspect or copy.

that contain delta-8-tetrahydrocannabinol, other derivatives of
tetrahydrocannabinol or synthetic cannabinoids;
(c) Recommendations for requirements for the testing,
packaging and labeling of consumable hemp products, including,
without limitation, standardized warning labels concerning any

CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to cannabis; revising provisions relating to the
confidentiality of certain information relating to cannabis;
revising provisions governing certain disciplinary
proceedings; revising provisions relating to the operation of a
cannabis establishment; revising certain requirements relating
to the packaging and labeling of cannabis and cannabis
products; authorizing the Cannabis Compliance Board to
issue summonses and subpoenas and take certain other
actions relating to unlicensed cannabis activities; revising
provisions relating to the licensing of a cannabis
establishment; revising provisions relating to cannabis
independent testing laboratories; revising provisions relating
to advertising engaged in and packaging used by a cannabis
establishment; exempting certain persons from state
prosecution for certain criminal offenses under certain
circumstances; requiring the Cannabis Advisory Commission
to conduct certain studies; making various other changes
relating to the regulation of cannabis; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of persons and
establishments involved in the cannabis industry in this State by the Cannabis
Compliance Board. (Title 56 of NRS) Existing law sets forth procedures by which
the Board may take disciplinary action against a licensee or registrant. (NRS
678A.500-678A.600) Under existing law, the Executive Director of the Board is
authorized to transmit the details of any suspected violation of the provisions of
existing law and regulations that govern the medical and adult use of cannabis to
the Attorney General for an investigation. (NRS 678A.500) After the investigation,
existing law requires the Board to determine whether to proceed with disciplinary
action against a licensee or registrant. (NRS 678A.510) If the Board proceeds with
disciplinary action, existing law: (1) requires the Board or the Executive Director to
serve a complaint upon the respondent; and (2) sets forth procedures for the
conduct of a disciplinary hearing before the Board. (NRS 678A.520-678A.590) If
the Board determines that a licensee or registrant has violated a provision of
existing law or regulations governing the medical and adult use of cannabis,
existing law authorizes the Board to impose certain penalties against the licensee or
registrant. (NRS 678A.600)
Sections 6 and 13-24 of this bill revise the procedures by which disciplinary
action may be taken against a licensee or registrant. Section 13 specifies that the
Executive Director is authorized to transmit the details of a suspected violation to
the Attorney General for further investigation. Section 24 makes a conforming
change to reflect the fact that an investigation of a violation is commenced by the
Executive Director, rather than the Board. Section 14 revises the actions the Board
must take with respect to each complaint resulting in an investigation by the
Attorney General. Section 15 revises the required content of a complaint served by
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 2 –
the Board or the Executive Director and the time in which the respondent may
answer the complaint. Upon receipt of an answer demanding a hearing or the
expiration of the time to answer the complaint, section 15 requires the Board to
assign the matter to a hearing officer. Sections 15-23 require a disciplinary hearing
to be heard before a hearing officer, rather than the Board, and revise procedures
for the conduct of such a hearing. Section 6: (1) provides that the decision and
order of a hearing officer is final unless a party aggrieved by the decision requests
that the Board review the decision and order or the Board initiates such a review on
its own motion; and (2) sets forth procedures for the conduct of a review by the
Board. Section 23 provides that any person aggrieved by a final decision or order
of the Board after a review conducted pursuant to section 6 is entitled to judicial
review of the decision or order.
Section 5 of this bill requires the Board to appoint one or more hearing officers
to conduct disciplinary hearings and render decisions.
Section 26 of this bill authorizes the Board, the Executive Director or a
designee of the Executive Director to issue a letter of warning, a letter of concern or
a nonpunitive admonishment under certain circumstances.
Existing law requires the Board to adopt regulations providing for the
investigation of unlicensed cannabis activities and the imposition of penalties
against persons who engage in such activities. (NRS 678A.450) Section 11 of this
bill authorizes the Board to issue summonses and subpoenas and to take certain
other actions in connection with such an investigation.
Sections 4, 12 and 54 of this bill revise provisions relating to the
confidentiality of certain information obtained by the Board. Existing law
authorizes the Governor or his or her designee to enter into one or more agreements
with tribal governments concerning cannabis. (NRS 223.250) Sections 52 and 53
of this bill provide that certain information received by a governmental entity from
a tribal government or a facility engaged in cannabis activities operating on tribal
land pursuant to the terms of such an agreement remains the property of the tribal
government, does not constitute a public record and must be kept confidential by
the governmental entity.
Sections 2, 7, 33, 34, 37 and 38 of this bill establish a standardized definition
of the term “local governmental jurisdiction” for the purposes of provisions
governing the medical and adult use of cannabis.
Existing law authorizes the Board to adopt regulations setting forth
requirements relating to the packaging and labeling of cannabis and cannabis
products. (NRS 678A.450) Section 11 prohibits those requirements from requiring:
(1) a package of cannabis or cannabis products which is sold at wholesale to
contain any label or tag other than a label or tag necessary for the functionality of
any computer software used for the seed-to-sale tracking of cannabis; and (2) a
cannabis establishment to include any information on the label for any cannabis or
a cannabis product that is already included on the packaging of the cannabis or
cannabis product. Sections 1.5 and 2.5 of this bill define the terms “label” and
“packaging” for the purposes of provisions of existing law governing the medical
and adult use of cannabis.
Existing law prohibits the production, distribution and sale of any synthetic
cannabinoid. (NRS 453.572, 557.255, 678B.525) Section 10 of this bill revises the
definition of “synthetic cannabinoid” to: (1) specify that any cannabinoid that is
either produced artificially or not obtained directly without the use of a chemical
reagent from a plant of the genus Cannabis constitutes a synthetic cannabinoid; and
(2) exclude THC produced using certain processes.
Existing law requires a cannabis establishment to use an inventory control
system. (NRS 678B.210, 678B.250, 678C.430) Existing law sets forth certain
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 3 –
requirements for the operation of such a system by a medical cannabis
establishment. (NRS 678C.430) Sections 27, 31, 32, 35 and 45 of this bill revise
those requirements and additionally apply the requirements to the operation of such
a system by an adult-use cannabis establishment. Sections 45 and 49 of this bill
revise requirements for a dual licensee concerning the reporting of inventory.
Existing law sets forth procedures by which a health authority, upon finding a
condition in the operation of a food establishment constituting a substantial hazard
to the public health, may issue an order to the holder of the permit to operate the
food establishment that may require the immediate suspension of the permit and
discontinuance of all food operations. (NRS 446.880) Section 30 of this bill sets
forth similar procedures by which an agent of the Board may issue such an order to
the holder of a cannabis establishment license if the agent finds a condition in the
operation of the cannabis establishment which constitutes a substantial hazard to
the public health. Section 30 sets forth certain conditions under which such an
order may not order the immediate suspension of the license and the immediate
discontinuance of the operations of the cannabis establishment. Section 29 of this
bill defines “substantial hazard to the public health” to include certain specified
conditions. Section 29 additionally requires the Board to adopt certain regulations
concerning substantial hazards to the public health which may exist at a cannabis
establishment.
Existing law requires an applicant for a medical cannabis establishment license
or adult-use cannabis establishment license to submit to the Board the physical
address of the proposed cannabis establishment, which, among other requirements,
must not be within a certain distance of a public or private school or community
facility. (NRS 678B.210, 678B.250) Sections 32 and 35 establish definitions of
“public school” and “private school” and revise the definition of “community
facility.”
Section 36 of this bill revises certain requirements for cannabis independent
testing laboratories.
Existing law deems the issuance of a license by the Board to be conditional in
certain local governmental jurisdictions until the cannabis establishment is in
compliance with applicable local governmental ordinances or rules and the local
government has issued a business license for the operation of the establishment.
(NRS 678B.320) Section 37 additionally deems the issuance of such a license to be
conditional until the cannabis establishment satisfies an inspection conducted by
the Board.
Section 39 of this bill revises the procedures that the operating documents of a
cannabis establishment are required to include to additionally include certain
procedures relating to the training of cannabis establishment agents and other
procedures established by the Board by regulation. (NRS 678B.510)
Section 40 of this bill revises certain restrictions on advertising engaged in and
packaging used by a cannabis establishment.
Existing law prohibits a person from selling, offering to sell, appearing to sell
or advertising the sale of cannabis or cannabis products unless the person holds an
adult-use cannabis establishment license or medical cannabis establishment license.
(NRS 678B.530) Section 41 of this bill prohibits those actions only if the person
does not have the appropriate type of license and additionally prohibits a person
from advertising as a cannabis sales facility or cannabis consumption lounge
without the appropriate type of license.
Existing law exempts an employee of the State Department of Agriculture from
state prosecution for certain offenses relating to cannabis under certain
circumstances. (NRS 678B.600) Section 42 of this bill expands that exemption to
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 4 –
also include an employee of the Board and an attorney who represents the
Department or the Board.
Existing law provides an exemption from state prosecution for the possession,
delivery and production of cannabis for: (1) a person who holds a valid registry
identification card or letter of approval; and (2) a person who is 21 years of age or
older. However, under existing law, that exemption is subject to certain limitations.
For example, with respect to usable cannabis, the exemption applies only to the
extent that a person does not, at any one time, possess, deliver or produce more
than 2.5 ounces of usable cannabis. (NRS 678C.200, 678D.200) Existing law also
prohibits a cannabis sales facility from selling to a person, in any one transaction,
more than 2.5 ounces of usable cannabis. (NRS 678B.550) Sections 3, 7 and 56 of
this bill revise the definition of “usable cannabis” to exclude the seeds of a plant of
the genus plant Cannabis and apply this definition throughout the provisions
of existing law governing the medical and adult use of cannabis. Section 47 of this
bill makes a conforming change to eliminate a reference to a provision that has
been repealed in section 56.
Existing law requires a medical cannabis establishment to maintain an
electronic verification system. (NRS 678B.210, 678C.420) Section 9 of this bill
changes the name of such a system to an electronic verification and authentication
system. Section 44 of this bill revises requirements concerning the operation of
such a system.
Existing law requires an adult-use cannabis product to be sold in a single
package. (NRS 678D.420) Section 48 of this bill revises requirements concerning
the amount of usable cannabis, concentrated cannabis or THC that a single package
may contain.
Existing law, with certain exceptions, prohibits smoking in any form within
indoor places of employment. (NRS 202.2483) Section 51 of this bill clarifies that
the smoking of cannabis in a cannabis consumption lounge in accordance with the
provisions of existing law governing the medical and adult-use of cannabis is not
prohibited.
Section 54.3 of this bill requires the Cannabis Advisory Commission to create a
subcommittee to conduct a study concerning certain matters relating to sales of
consumable hemp products in this State. Section 54.7 of this bill additionally
requires the Commission to create a subcommittee to conduct a study concerning
the manner in which cannabis and cannabis products are taxed in this State.

declared a public book or record, or a part thereof, to be
confidential, if a public book or record has been in the legal custody
or control of one or more governmental entities for at least 30 years,
