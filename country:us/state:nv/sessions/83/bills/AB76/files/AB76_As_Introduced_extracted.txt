Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of persons and
2 establishments involved in the cannabis industry in this State by the Cannabis
3 Compliance Board. (Title 56 of NRS) Existing law sets forth procedures by which
4 the Board may take disciplinary action against a licensee or registrant. (NRS
5 678A.500-678A.600) Under existing law, the Executive Director of the Board is
6 authorized to transmit the details of any suspected violation of the provisions of
7 existing law and regulations that govern the medical and adult use of cannabis to
8 the Attorney General for an investigation. (NRS 678A.500) After the investigation,
9 existing law requires the Board to determine whether to proceed with disciplinary
10 action against a licensee or registrant. (NRS 678A.510) If the Board proceeds with
11 disciplinary action, existing law: (1) requires the Board or the Executive Director to
12 serve a complaint upon the respondent; and (2) sets forth procedures for the
13 conduct of a disciplinary hearing before the Board. (NRS 678A.520-678A.590) If
14 the Board determines that a licensee or registrant has violated a provision of
15 existing law or regulations governing the medical and adult use of cannabis,
16 existing law authorizes the Board to impose certain penalties against the licensee or
17 registrant. (NRS 678A.600)
18 Sections 6, 11 and 13-24 of this bill revise the procedures by which
19 disciplinary action may be taken against a licensee or registrant. Section 13
20 specifies that the Executive Director is authorized to transmit the details of a
21 suspected violation to the Attorney General for further investigation. Section 24
22 makes a conforming change to reflect the fact that an investigation of a violation is
23 commenced by the Executive Director, rather than the Board. Section 14 requires
24 the Executive Director, rather than the Board, to make the determination whether to
25 proceed with disciplinary action. If the Executive Director makes a determination
26 to proceed, section 15 requires the Executive Director to serve upon the respondent
27 either a complaint or notice of violation. Section 11 requires the Board to adopt
28 regulations prescribing a list of violations which are appropriate for the issuance of
29 a notice of violation. Section 15 revises the required content of a complaint and sets
30 forth the required content of a notice of violation. Under section 15, if the
31 Executive Director serves a notice of violation, the Executive Director may seek
32 only the imposition of a civil penalty. Section 15 requires the respondent to either
33 answer the complaint or notice of violation or, for a notice of violation, pay the
34 civil penalty being sought. Upon receipt of an answer demanding a hearing or the
35 expiration of the time to answer the complaint or notice of violation, section 15
36 requires the Executive Director to assign the matter to a hearing officer. Sections
37 15-23 require a disciplinary hearing to be heard before a hearing officer, rather than
38 the Board, and revise procedures for the conduct of such a hearing. Section 6: (1)
39 provides that the decision and order of a hearing officer is final unless a party
40 aggrieved by the decision requests that the Board review the decision or the Board
41 initiates such a review on its own motion; and (2) sets forth procedures for the
42 conduct of a review by the Board. Section 23 provides that any person aggrieved
43 by a final decision or order of the Board after a review conducted pursuant to
44 section 6 is entitled to judicial review of the decision or order.
45 Section 5 of this bill requires the Board to appoint one or more hearing officers
46 to conduct disciplinary hearings and render decisions.
47 Section 26 of this bill authorizes the Board, the Executive Director or a
48 designee of the Executive Director to issue a letter of warning, a letter of concern or
49 a nonpunitive admonishment under certain circumstances.
50 Existing law requires the Board to adopt regulations providing for the
51 investigation of unlicensed cannabis activities and the imposition of penalties
52 against persons who engage in such activities. (NRS 678A.450) Section 11
53 authorizes the Board to issue summonses and subpoenas and to take certain other
54 actions in connection with such an investigation.

55 Sections 4, 12 and 54 of this bill revise provisions relating to the
56 confidentiality of certain information obtained by the Board. Existing law
57 authorizes the Governor or his or her designee to enter into one or more agreements
58 with tribal governments concerning cannabis. (NRS 223.250) Sections 52 and 53
59 of this bill provide that certain information received by a governmental entity
60 pursuant to the terms of such an agreement does not constitute a public record and
61 is confidential.
62 Sections 2, 7, 33, 34, 37 and 38 of this bill establish a standardized definition
63 of the term “local governmental jurisdiction” for the purposes of provisions
64 governing the medical and adult use of cannabis.
65 Existing law prohibits the production, distribution and sale of any synthetic
66 cannabinoid. (NRS 453.572, 557.255, 678B.525) Section 10 of this bill revises the
67 definition of “synthetic cannabinoid” to: (1) specify that any cannabinoid that is
68 either produced artificially or not obtained directly without the use of chemicals
69 from a plant of the genus Cannabis constitutes a synthetic cannabinoid; and (2)
70 exclude delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol produced using certain processes.
71 Existing law requires a cannabis establishment to use an inventory control
72 system. (NRS 678B.210, 678B.250, 678C.430) Existing law sets forth certain
73 requirements for the operation of such a system by a medical cannabis
74 establishment. (NRS 678B.430) Sections 27, 31, 32, 35 and 45 of this bill revise
75 those requirements and additionally apply the requirements to the operation of such
76 a system by an adult-use cannabis establishment. Sections 45 and 49 of this bill
77 revise requirements for a dual licensee concerning the reporting of inventory.
78 Existing law authorizes a medical cannabis establishment to: (1) transport
79 medical cannabis to another cannabis establishment or between the buildings of the
80 medical cannabis establishment; and (2) enter into a contract with a third party to
81 provide such transportation. (NRS 678C.460) Existing law, with certain exceptions,
82 prohibits an adult-use cannabis establishment from transporting cannabis or
83 cannabis products to an adult-use cannabis retail store unless the adult-use cannabis
84 establishment holds an adult-use cannabis establishment license for an adult-use
85 cannabis distributor. (NRS 678D.410, 678D.440) Section 46 of this bill eliminates
86 the authorization for a medical cannabis establishment to transport cannabis or
87 cannabis products and to enter into a contract with a third party to transport
88 cannabis or cannabis products. Section 28 of this bill instead prohibits, with certain
89 exceptions, any cannabis establishment from transporting cannabis or cannabis
90 products to another cannabis establishment or between the buildings of a cannabis
91 establishment unless the cannabis establishment holds an adult-use
92 cannabis establishment license for an adult-use cannabis distributor. Section 50 of
93 this bill authorizes an adult-use cannabis distributor to transport cannabis and
94 cannabis products between a cannabis establishment and another cannabis
95 establishment or between the buildings of a cannabis establishment. Section 8 of
96 this bill revises the definition of “adult-use cannabis distributor” to reflect the
97 authorizations set forth in section 50.
98 Existing law sets forth procedures by which a health authority, upon finding a
99 condition in the operation of a food establishment constituting a substantial hazard
100 to the public health, may issue an order to the holder of the permit to operate the
101 food establishment that may require the immediate suspension of the permit and
102 discontinuance of all food operations. (NRS 446.880) Section 30 of this bill sets
103 forth similar procedures by which an agent of the Board may issue such an order to
104 the holder of a cannabis establishment license if the agent finds a condition in the
105 operation of the cannabis establishment which constitutes a substantial hazard to
106 the public health. Section 30 sets forth certain conditions under which such an
107 order may not order the immediate suspension of the license and the immediate
108 discontinuance of the operations of the cannabis establishment. Section 29 of this
109 bill defines “substantial hazard to the public health” to include certain specified
-
*AB76*
– 4 –
110 conditions. Section 29 additionally requires the Board to adopt certain regulations
111 concerning substantial hazards to the public health which may exist at a cannabis
112 establishment.
113 Existing law requires an applicant for a medical cannabis establishment license
114 or adult-use cannabis establishment license to submit to the Board the physical
115 address of the proposed cannabis establishment, which, among other requirements,
116 must not be within a certain distance of a public or private school or community
117 facility. (NRS 678B.210, 678B.250) Sections 32 and 35 establish definitions of
118 “public school” and “private school” and revise the definition of “community
119 facility.”
120 Section 36 of this bill revises certain requirements for cannabis independent
121 testing laboratories.
122 Existing law deems the issuance of a license by the Board to be conditional in
123 certain local governmental jurisdictions until the cannabis establishment is in
124 compliance with applicable local governmental ordinances or rules and the local
125 government has issued a business license for the operation of the establishment.
126 (NRS 678B.320) Section 37 additionally deems the issuance of such a license to be
127 conditional until the cannabis establishment satisfies an inspection conducted by
128 the Board.
129 Existing law prohibits a cannabis establishment from dispensing or selling
130 cannabis or cannabis products from a vending machine or allowing such a vending
131 machine to be installed on the premises of the cannabis establishment. (NRS
132 678B.510) Section 39 of this bill authorizes a cannabis establishment to engage in
133 such activities upon the approval of the Board. Section 39 additionally revises the
134 procedures that the operating documents of a cannabis establishment are required to
135 include.
136 Existing law authorizes a medical cannabis production facility to: (1) acquire
137 hemp or a commodity or product made using hemp from a grower or handler
138 registered by the State Department of Agriculture; and (2) use hemp or a
139 commodity or product made using hemp to manufacture medical cannabis products.
140 (NRS 687C.410) Sections 40 and 43 of this bill instead authorize any cannabis
141 production facility to: (1) acquire hemp from any source approved by the Board; (2)
142 use hemp to manufacture cannabis products; and (3) sell to a cannabis sales facility
143 a cannabis product that contains hemp. Section 40 additionally authorizes a
144 cannabis sales facility to acquire hemp or a commodity or product made using
145 hemp from any source approved by the Board and to sell hemp or any cannabis
146 product that contains hemp, in addition to any commodity or product made using
147 hemp.
148 Existing law prohibits a person from selling, offering to sell, appearing to sell
149 or advertising the sale of cannabis or cannabis products unless the person holds an
150 adult-use cannabis establishment license or medical cannabis establishment license.
151 (NRS 678B.530) Section 41 of this bill prohibits those actions only if the person
152 does not have the appropriate type of license and additionally prohibits a person
153 from advertising as a cannabis sales facility or cannabis consumption lounge
154 without the appropriate type of license.
155 Existing law exempts an employee of the State Department of Agriculture from
156 state prosecution for certain offenses relating to cannabis under certain
157 circumstances. (NRS 678B.600) Section 42 of this bill expands that exemption to
158 also include an employee of the Board and an attorney who represents the
159 Department or the Board.
160 Existing law provides an exemption from state prosecution for the possession,
161 delivery and production of cannabis for: (1) a person who holds a valid registry
162 identification card or letter of approval; and (2) a person who is 21 years of age or
163 older. However, under existing law, that exemption is subject to certain limitations.
164 For example, with respect to usable cannabis, the exemption applies only to the
-
*AB76*
– 5 –
165 extent that a person does not, at any one time, possess, deliver or produce more
166 than 2.5 ounces of usable cannabis. (NRS 678C.200, 678D.200) Existing law also
167 prohibits a cannabis sales facility from selling to a person, in any one transaction,
168 more than 2.5 ounces of usable cannabis. (NRS 678B.550) Sections 3, 7 and 56 of
169 this bill revise the definition of “usable cannabis” to exclude the seeds of a plant of
170 the genus plant Cannabis and applies this definition throughout the provisions
171 of existing law governing the medical and adult use of cannabis. Section 47 of this
172 bill makes a conforming change to eliminate a reference to a provision that has
173 been repealed in section 56.
174 Existing law requires a medical cannabis establishment to maintain an
175 electronic verification system. (NRS 678B.210, 678C.420) Section 9 of this bill
176 changes the name of such a system to an electronic verification and authentication
177 system. Section 44 of this bill revises requirements concerning the operation of
178 such a system.
179 Existing law requires an adult-use cannabis product to be sold in a single
180 package. (NRS 678D.420) Section 48 of this bill revises requirements concerning
181 the amount of usable cannabis or THC that a single package may contain.
182 Existing law, with certain exceptions, prohibits smoking in any form within
183 indoor places of employment. (NRS 202.2483) Section 51 of this bill clarifies that
184 the smoking of cannabis in a cannabis consumption lounge in accordance with the
185 provisions of existing law governing the medical and adult-use of cannabis is not
186 prohibited.

28 678A.450, a notice of violation.
29  The fact that an alleged violation is a violation that the Board
30 has determined to be appropriate for the issuance of a notice of
31 violation does not prohibit the Executive Director from issuing a
32 complaint concerning the alleged violation rather than a notice of
33 violation.

15 hearing officer.
16 7. Failure to [answer] comply with subsection 4 or , if the
17 respondent has demanded a hearing pursuant to subsection 5, to
18 appear at the hearing constitutes an admission by the respondent of
19 all facts alleged in the complaint [.] or notice of violation. The
20 [Board] hearing officer may take action based on such an admission
21 and on other evidence without further notice to the respondent. If
22 the [Board] hearing officer takes action based on such an

26 and place of the hearing as soon as is reasonably practical after

36 Board] hearing officer may grant one or more extensions to the [45-

9 hearings. Fees, subsistence and transportation expenses must be paid
10 by the party at whose request the witness is subpoenaed. [The Board
11 may award as costs the amount of all such expenses to the
12 prevailing party.]

32 in NRS 233B.123 apply. Any relevant evidence that is not
33 immaterial or unduly repetitious may be admitted and is sufficient in
34 itself to support a finding if it is the sort of evidence on which
35 responsible persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious
36 affairs, regardless of the existence of any common law or statutory
37 rule which might make improper the admission of such evidence
38 over objection in a civil action.
39 (e) The parties or their counsel may by written stipulation agree
40 that certain specified evidence may be admitted even though such
41 evidence might otherwise be subject to objection.

13 together with a notice as provided in paragraph (c).
14 (b) Unless the opposing party, within 7 days after such service,

1 unless otherwise declared by law to be confidential, all public books
2 and public records of a governmental entity must be open at all
3 times during office hours to inspection by any person, and may be
4 fully copied or an abstract or memorandum may be prepared from
5 those public books and public records. Any such copies, abstracts or
6 memoranda may be used to supply the general public with copies,
7 abstracts or memoranda of the records or may be used in any other
8 way to the advantage of the governmental entity or of the general
9 public. This section does not supersede or in any manner affect the
10 federal laws governing copyrights or enlarge, diminish or affect in
11 any other manner the rights of a person in any written book or
12 record which is copyrighted pursuant to federal law.
13 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record
14 which is copyrighted solely because it is copyrighted.
15 3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a
16 public book or record shall not deny a request made pursuant to
17 subsection 1 to inspect or copy or receive a copy of a public book or
18 record on the basis that the requested public book or record contains
19 information that is confidential if the governmental entity can
20 redact, delete, conceal or separate, including, without limitation,
21 electronically, the confidential information from the information
22 included in the public book or record that is not otherwise
23 confidential.
24 4. If requested, a governmental entity shall provide a copy of a
25 public record in an electronic format by means of an electronic
26 medium. Nothing in this subsection requires a governmental entity
27 to provide a copy of a public record in an electronic format or by
28 means of an electronic medium if:
29 (a) The public record:
30 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
31 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
32 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by
33 means of an electronic medium would:
34 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
35 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential
36 and that cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from
37 information that is not otherwise confidential.
38 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who
39 has legal custody or control of a public record:
40 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the
41 medium that is requested because the officer, employee or agent has
42 already prepared or would prefer to provide the copy in a different
43 medium.
44 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon
45 request, prepare the copy of the public record and shall not require

1 the person who has requested the copy to prepare the copy himself
2 or herself.
3 Sec. 54. NRS 239.0115 is hereby amended to read as follows:
4 239.0115 1. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection
5 and subsection 3, notwithstanding any provision of law that has
6 declared a public book or record, or a part thereof, to be
7 confidential, if a public book or record has been in the legal custody
8 or control of one or more governmental entities for at least 30 years,
9 a person may apply to the district court of the county in which the
10 governmental entity that currently has legal custody or control of the
11 public book or record is located for an order directing that
12 governmental entity to allow the person to inspect or copy the public
13 book or record, or a part thereof. If the public book or record
14 pertains to a natural person, a person may not apply for an order
15 pursuant to this subsection until the public book or record has been
16 in the legal custody or control of one or more governmental entities
17 for at least 30 years or until the death of the person to whom the
18 public book or record pertains, whichever is later.
19 2. There is a rebuttable presumption that a person who applies
20 for an order as described in subsection 1 is entitled to inspect or
21 copy the public book or record, or a part thereof, that the person
22 seeks to inspect or copy.
23 3. The provisions of subsection 1 do not apply to any book or
24 record:
25 (a) Declared confidential pursuant to NRS 463.120 [.] or
26 678A.470.
27 (b) Containing personal information pertaining to a victim of
28 crime that has been declared by law to be confidential.
29 Sec. 55. The amendatory provisions of sections 5, 6 and 13 to
30 23, inclusive, of this act apply to any judicial or administrative
31 proceedings commenced on or after the effective date of this act.

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of persons and
2 establishments involved in the cannabis industry in this State by the Cannabis
3 Compliance Board. (Title 56 of NRS) Existing law sets forth procedures by which
4 the Board may take disciplinary action against a licensee or registrant. (NRS
5 678A.500-678A.600) Under existing law, the Executive Director of the Board is
6 authorized to transmit the details of any suspected violation of the provisions of
7 existing law and regulations that govern the medical and adult use of cannabis to
8 the Attorney General for an investigation. (NRS 678A.500) After the investigation,
9 existing law requires the Board to determine whether to proceed with disciplinary
10 action against a licensee or registrant. (NRS 678A.510) If the Board proceeds with
11 disciplinary action, existing law: (1) requires the Board or the Executive Director to
12 serve a complaint upon the respondent; and (2) sets forth procedures for the
13 conduct of a disciplinary hearing before the Board. (NRS 678A.520-678A.590) If
14 the Board determines that a licensee or registrant has violated a provision of
15 existing law or regulations governing the medical and adult use of cannabis,
16 existing law authorizes the Board to impose certain penalties against the licensee or
17 registrant. (NRS 678A.600)
18 Sections 6, 11 and 13-24 of this bill revise the procedures by which
19 disciplinary action may be taken against a licensee or registrant. Section 13
20 specifies that the Executive Director is authorized to transmit the details of a
21 suspected violation to the Attorney General for further investigation. Section 24
22 makes a conforming change to reflect the fact that an investigation of a violation is
23 commenced by the Executive Director, rather than the Board. Section 14 requires
24 the Executive Director, rather than the Board, to make the determination whether to
25 proceed with disciplinary action. If the Executive Director makes a determination
26 to proceed, section 15 requires the Executive Director to serve upon the respondent
27 either a complaint or notice of violation. Section 11 requires the Board to adopt
28 regulations prescribing a list of violations which are appropriate for the issuance of
29 a notice of violation. Section 15 revises the required content of a complaint and sets
30 forth the required content of a notice of violation. Under section 15, if the
31 Executive Director serves a notice of violation, the Executive Director may seek
32 only the imposition of a civil penalty. Section 15 requires the respondent to either
33 answer the complaint or notice of violation or, for a notice of violation, pay the
34 civil penalty being sought. Upon receipt of an answer demanding a hearing or the
35 expiration of the time to answer the complaint or notice of violation, section 15
36 requires the Executive Director to assign the matter to a hearing officer. Sections
37 15-23 require a disciplinary hearing to be heard before a hearing officer, rather than
38 the Board, and revise procedures for the conduct of such a hearing. Section 6: (1)
39 provides that the decision and order of a hearing officer is final unless a party
40 aggrieved by the decision requests that the Board review the decision or the Board
41 initiates such a review on its own motion; and (2) sets forth procedures for the
42 conduct of a review by the Board. Section 23 provides that any person aggrieved
43 by a final decision or order of the Board after a review conducted pursuant to
44 section 6 is entitled to judicial review of the decision or order.
45 Section 5 of this bill requires the Board to appoint one or more hearing officers
46 to conduct disciplinary hearings and render decisions.
47 Section 26 of this bill authorizes the Board, the Executive Director or a
48 designee of the Executive Director to issue a letter of warning, a letter of concern or
49 a nonpunitive admonishment under certain circumstances.
50 Existing law requires the Board to adopt regulations providing for the
51 investigation of unlicensed cannabis activities and the imposition of penalties
52 against persons who engage in such activities. (NRS 678A.450) Section 11
53 authorizes the Board to issue summonses and subpoenas and to take certain other
54 actions in connection with such an investigation.
-
*AB76*

– 3 –
55 Sections 4, 12 and 54 of this bill revise provisions relating to the
56 confidentiality of certain information obtained by the Board. Existing law
57 authorizes the Governor or his or her designee to enter into one or more agreements
58 with tribal governments concerning cannabis. (NRS 223.250) Sections 52 and 53
59 of this bill provide that certain information received by a governmental entity
60 pursuant to the terms of such an agreement does not constitute a public record and
61 is confidential.
62 Sections 2, 7, 33, 34, 37 and 38 of this bill establish a standardized definition
63 of the term “local governmental jurisdiction” for the purposes of provisions
64 governing the medical and adult use of cannabis.
65 Existing law prohibits the production, distribution and sale of any synthetic
66 cannabinoid. (NRS 453.572, 557.255, 678B.525) Section 10 of this bill revises the
67 definition of “synthetic cannabinoid” to: (1) specify that any cannabinoid that is
68 either produced artificially or not obtained directly without the use of chemicals
69 from a plant of the genus Cannabis constitutes a synthetic cannabinoid; and (2)
70 exclude delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol produced using certain processes.
71 Existing law requires a cannabis establishment to use an inventory control
72 system. (NRS 678B.210, 678B.250, 678C.430) Existing law sets forth certain
73 requirements for the operation of such a system by a medical cannabis
74 establishment. (NRS 678B.430) Sections 27, 31, 32, 35 and 45 of this bill revise
75 those requirements and additionally apply the requirements to the operation of such
76 a system by an adult-use cannabis establishment. Sections 45 and 49 of this bill
77 revise requirements for a dual licensee concerning the reporting of inventory.
78 Existing law authorizes a medical cannabis establishment to: (1) transport
79 medical cannabis to another cannabis establishment or between the buildings of the
80 medical cannabis establishment; and (2) enter into a contract with a third party to
81 provide such transportation. (NRS 678C.460) Existing law, with certain exceptions,
82 prohibits an adult-use cannabis establishment from transporting cannabis or
83 cannabis products to an adult-use cannabis retail store unless the adult-use cannabis
84 establishment holds an adult-use cannabis establishment license for an adult-use
85 cannabis distributor. (NRS 678D.410, 678D.440) Section 46 of this bill eliminates
86 the authorization for a medical cannabis establishment to transport cannabis or
87 cannabis products and to enter into a contract with a third party to transport
88 cannabis or cannabis products. Section 28 of this bill instead prohibits, with certain
89 exceptions, any cannabis establishment from transporting cannabis or cannabis
90 products to another cannabis establishment or between the buildings of a cannabis
91 establishment unless the cannabis establishment holds an adult-use
92 cannabis establishment license for an adult-use cannabis distributor. Section 50 of
93 this bill authorizes an adult-use cannabis distributor to transport cannabis and
94 cannabis products between a cannabis establishment and another cannabis
95 establishment or between the buildings of a cannabis establishment. Section 8 of
96 this bill revises the definition of “adult-use cannabis distributor” to reflect the
97 authorizations set forth in section 50.
98 Existing law sets forth procedures by which a health authority, upon finding a
99 condition in the operation of a food establishment constituting a substantial hazard
100 to the public health, may issue an order to the holder of the permit to operate the
101 food establishment that may require the immediate suspension of the permit and
102 discontinuance of all food operations. (NRS 446.880) Section 30 of this bill sets
103 forth similar procedures by which an agent of the Board may issue such an order to
104 the holder of a cannabis establishment license if the agent finds a condition in the
105 operation of the cannabis establishment which constitutes a substantial hazard to
106 the public health. Section 30 sets forth certain conditions under which such an
107 order may not order the immediate suspension of the license and the immediate
108 discontinuance of the operations of the cannabis establishment. Section 29 of this
109 bill defines “substantial hazard to the public health” to include certain specified
-
*AB76*

– 4 –
110 conditions. Section 29 additionally requires the Board to adopt certain regulations
111 concerning substantial hazards to the public health which may exist at a cannabis
112 establishment.
113 Existing law requires an applicant for a medical cannabis establishment license
114 or adult-use cannabis establishment license to submit to the Board the physical
115 address of the proposed cannabis establishment, which, among other requirements,
116 must not be within a certain distance of a public or private school or community
117 facility. (NRS 678B.210, 678B.250) Sections 32 and 35 establish definitions of
118 “public school” and “private school” and revise the definition of “community
119 facility.”
120 Section 36 of this bill revises certain requirements for cannabis independent
121 testing laboratories.
122 Existing law deems the issuance of a license by the Board to be conditional in
123 certain local governmental jurisdictions until the cannabis establishment is in
124 compliance with applicable local governmental ordinances or rules and the local
125 government has issued a business license for the operation of the establishment.
126 (NRS 678B.320) Section 37 additionally deems the issuance of such a license to be
127 conditional until the cannabis establishment satisfies an inspection conducted by
128 the Board.
129 Existing law prohibits a cannabis establishment from dispensing or selling
130 cannabis or cannabis products from a vending machine or allowing such a vending
131 machine to be installed on the premises of the cannabis establishment. (NRS
132 678B.510) Section 39 of this bill authorizes a cannabis establishment to engage in
133 such activities upon the approval of the Board. Section 39 additionally revises the
134 procedures that the operating documents of a cannabis establishment are required to
135 include.
136 Existing law authorizes a medical cannabis production facility to: (1) acquire
137 hemp or a commodity or product made using hemp from a grower or handler
138 registered by the State Department of Agriculture; and (2) use hemp or a
139 commodity or product made using hemp to manufacture medical cannabis products.
140 (NRS 687C.410) Sections 40 and 43 of this bill instead authorize any cannabis
141 production facility to: (1) acquire hemp from any source approved by the Board; (2)
142 use hemp to manufacture cannabis products; and (3) sell to a cannabis sales facility
143 a cannabis product that contains hemp. Section 40 additionally authorizes a
144 cannabis sales facility to acquire hemp or a commodity or product made using
145 hemp from any source approved by the Board and to sell hemp or any cannabis
146 product that contains hemp, in addition to any commodity or product made using
147 hemp.
148 Existing law prohibits a person from selling, offering to sell, appearing to sell
149 or advertising the sale of cannabis or cannabis products unless the person holds an
150 adult-use cannabis establishment license or medical cannabis establishment license.
151 (NRS 678B.530) Section 41 of this bill prohibits those actions only if the person
152 does not have the appropriate type of license and additionally prohibits a person
153 from advertising as a cannabis sales facility or cannabis consumption lounge
154 without the appropriate type of license.
155 Existing law exempts an employee of the State Department of Agriculture from
156 state prosecution for certain offenses relating to cannabis under certain
157 circumstances. (NRS 678B.600) Section 42 of this bill expands that exemption to
158 also include an employee of the Board and an attorney who represents the
159 Department or the Board.
160 Existing law provides an exemption from state prosecution for the possession,
161 delivery and production of cannabis for: (1) a person who holds a valid registry
162 identification card or letter of approval; and (2) a person who is 21 years of age or
163 older. However, under existing law, that exemption is subject to certain limitations.
164 For example, with respect to usable cannabis, the exemption applies only to the
-
*AB76*

– 5 –
165 extent that a person does not, at any one time, possess, deliver or produce more
166 than 2.5 ounces of usable cannabis. (NRS 678C.200, 678D.200) Existing law also
167 prohibits a cannabis sales facility from selling to a person, in any one transaction,
168 more than 2.5 ounces of usable cannabis. (NRS 678B.550) Sections 3, 7 and 56 of
169 this bill revise the definition of “usable cannabis” to exclude the seeds of a plant of
170 the genus plant Cannabis and applies this definition throughout the provisions
171 of existing law governing the medical and adult use of cannabis. Section 47 of this
172 bill makes a conforming change to eliminate a reference to a provision that has
173 been repealed in section 56.
174 Existing law requires a medical cannabis establishment to maintain an
175 electronic verification system. (NRS 678B.210, 678C.420) Section 9 of this bill
176 changes the name of such a system to an electronic verification and authentication
177 system. Section 44 of this bill revises requirements concerning the operation of
178 such a system.
179 Existing law requires an adult-use cannabis product to be sold in a single
180 package. (NRS 678D.420) Section 48 of this bill revises requirements concerning
181 the amount of usable cannabis or THC that a single package may contain.
182 Existing law, with certain exceptions, prohibits smoking in any form within
183 indoor places of employment. (NRS 202.2483) Section 51 of this bill clarifies that
184 the smoking of cannabis in a cannabis consumption lounge in accordance with the
185 provisions of existing law governing the medical and adult-use of cannabis is not
186 prohibited.

34 itself to support a finding if it is the sort of evidence on which
35 responsible persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious
36 affairs, regardless of the existence of any common law or statutory
37 rule which might make improper the admission of such evidence
38 over objection in a civil action.
