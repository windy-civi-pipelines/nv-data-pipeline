Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of persons and establishments
2 involved in the cannabis industry in this State by the Cannabis Compliance Board. (Title 56 of
3 NRS) Existing law sets forth procedures by which the Board may take disciplinary action
4 against a licensee or registrant. (NRS 678A.500-678A.600) Under existing law, the Executive
5 Director of the Board is authorized to transmit the details of any suspected violation of the
6 provisions of existing law and regulations that govern the medical and adult use of cannabis to
7 the Attorney General for an investigation. (NRS 678A.500) After the investigation, existing
8 law requires the Board to determine whether to proceed with disciplinary action against a
9 licensee or registrant. (NRS 678A.510) If the Board proceeds with disciplinary action,
10 existing law: (1) requires the Board or the Executive Director to serve a complaint upon the
11 respondent; and (2) sets forth procedures for the conduct of a disciplinary hearing before the
12 Board. (NRS 678A.520-678A.590) If the Board determines that a licensee or registrant has
13 violated a provision of existing law or regulations governing the medical and adult use of

Assembly Amendment No. 173 to Assembly Bill No. 76 Page 4
14 cannabis, existing law authorizes the Board to impose certain penalties against the licensee or
15 registrant. (NRS 678A.600)
16 Sections 6 [, 11] and 13-24 of this bill revise the procedures by which disciplinary action
17 may be taken against a licensee or registrant. Section 13 specifies that the Executive Director
18 is authorized to transmit the details of a suspected violation to the Attorney General for further
19 investigation. Section 24 makes a conforming change to reflect the fact that an investigation
20 of a violation is commenced by the Executive Director, rather than the Board. Section 14
21 [requires the Executive Director, rather than] revises the actions the Board [, to make the
22 determination whether to proceed with disciplinary action. If the Executive Director makes a
23 determination to proceed, section 15 requires the Executive Director to serve upon the
24 respondent either a complaint or notice of violation. Section 11 requires the Board to adopt
25 regulations prescribing a list of violations which are appropriate for the issuance of a notice of
26 violation.] must take with respect to each complaint resulting in an investigation by the
27 Attorney General. Section 15 revises the required content of a complaint [and sets forth the
28 required content of a notice of violation. Under section 15, if the Executive Director serves a
29 notice of violation, the Executive Director may seek only the imposition of a civil penalty.
30 Section 15 requires the respondent to either answer the complaint or notice of violation or, for
31 a notice of violation, pay the civil penalty being sought.] served by the Board or the
32 Executive Director and the time in which the respondent may answer the complaint.
33 Upon receipt of an answer demanding a hearing or the expiration of the time to answer the
34 complaint , [or notice of violation,] section 15 requires the [Executive Director] Board to
35 assign the matter to a hearing officer. Sections 15-23 require a disciplinary hearing to be
36 heard before a hearing officer, rather than the Board, and revise procedures for the conduct of
37 such a hearing. Section 6: (1) provides that the decision and order of a hearing officer is final
38 unless a party aggrieved by the decision requests that the Board review the decision and
39 order or the Board initiates such a review on its own motion; and (2) sets forth procedures for
40 the conduct of a review by the Board. Section 23 provides that any person aggrieved by a
41 final decision or order of the Board after a review conducted pursuant to section 6 is entitled
42 to judicial review of the decision or order.
43 Section 5 of this bill requires the Board to appoint one or more hearing officers to
44 conduct disciplinary hearings and render decisions.
45 Section 26 of this bill authorizes the Board, the Executive Director or a designee of the
46 Executive Director to issue a letter of warning, a letter of concern or a nonpunitive
47 admonishment under certain circumstances.
48 Existing law requires the Board to adopt regulations providing for the investigation of
49 unlicensed cannabis activities and the imposition of penalties against persons who engage in
50 such activities. (NRS 678A.450) Section 11 authorizes the Board to issue summonses and
51 subpoenas and to take certain other actions in connection with such an investigation.
52 Sections 4, 12 and 54 of this bill revise provisions relating to the confidentiality of
53 certain information obtained by the Board. Existing law authorizes the Governor or his or her
54 designee to enter into one or more agreements with tribal governments concerning cannabis.
55 (NRS 223.250) Sections 52 and 53 of this bill provide that certain information received by a
56 governmental entity from a tribal government or a facility engaged in cannabis activities
57 operating on tribal land pursuant to the terms of such an agreement remains the property
58 of the tribal government, does not constitute a public record and [is] must be kept
59 confidential [.] by the governmental entity.
60 Sections 2, 7, 33, 34, 37 and 38 of this bill establish a standardized definition of the term
61 “local governmental jurisdiction” for the purposes of provisions governing the medical and
62 adult use of cannabis.
63 Existing law prohibits the production, distribution and sale of any synthetic cannabinoid.
64 (NRS 453.572, 557.255, 678B.525) Section 10 of this bill revises the definition of “synthetic
65 cannabinoid” to: (1) specify that any cannabinoid that is either produced artificially or not
66 obtained directly without the use of [chemicals] a chemical reagent from a plant of the genus
67 Cannabis constitutes a synthetic cannabinoid; and (2) exclude [delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol]
68 THC produced using certain processes.
69 Existing law requires a cannabis establishment to use an inventory control system. (NRS
70 678B.210, 678B.250, 678C.430) Existing law sets forth certain requirements for the operation
71 of such a system by a medical cannabis establishment. (NRS 678B.430) Sections 27, 31, 32,
72 35 and 45 of this bill revise those requirements and additionally apply the requirements to the

Assembly Amendment No. 173 to Assembly Bill No. 76 Page 5
73 operation of such a system by an adult-use cannabis establishment. Sections 45 and 49 of this
74 bill revise requirements for a dual licensee concerning the reporting of inventory.
75 [Existing law authorizes a medical cannabis establishment to: (1) transport medical
76 cannabis to another cannabis establishment or between the buildings of the medical cannabis
77 establishment; and (2) enter into a contract with a third party to provide such transportation.
78 (NRS 678C.460) Existing law, with certain exceptions, prohibits an adult-use cannabis
79 establishment from transporting cannabis or cannabis products to an adult-use cannabis retail
80 store unless the adult-use cannabis establishment holds an adult-use cannabis establishment
81 license for an adult-use cannabis distributor. (NRS 678D.410, 678D.440) Section 46 of this
82 bill eliminates the authorization for a medical cannabis establishment to transport cannabis or
83 cannabis products and to enter into a contract with a third party to transport cannabis or
84 cannabis products. Section 28 of this bill instead prohibits, with certain exceptions, any
85 cannabis establishment from transporting cannabis or cannabis products to another cannabis
86 establishment or between the buildings of a cannabis establishment unless the cannabis
87 establishment holds an adult-use cannabis establishment license for an adult-use cannabis
88 distributor. Section 50 of this bill authorizes an adult-use cannabis distributor to transport
89 cannabis and cannabis products between a cannabis establishment and another cannabis
90 establishment or between the buildings of a cannabis establishment. Section 8 of this bill
91 revises the definition of “adult-use cannabis distributor” to reflect the authorizations set forth
92 in section 50.]
93 Existing law sets forth procedures by which a health authority, upon finding a condition
94 in the operation of a food establishment constituting a substantial hazard to the public health,
95 may issue an order to the holder of the permit to operate the food establishment that may
96 require the immediate suspension of the permit and discontinuance of all food operations.
97 (NRS 446.880) Section 30 of this bill sets forth similar procedures by which an agent of the
98 Board may issue such an order to the holder of a cannabis establishment license if the agent
99 finds a condition in the operation of the cannabis establishment which constitutes a substantial
100 hazard to the public health. Section 30 sets forth certain conditions under which such an order
101 may not order the immediate suspension of the license and the immediate discontinuance of
102 the operations of the cannabis establishment. Section 29 of this bill defines “substantial
103 hazard to the public health” to include certain specified conditions. Section 29 additionally
104 requires the Board to adopt certain regulations concerning substantial hazards to the public
105 health which may exist at a cannabis establishment.
106 Existing law requires an applicant for a medical cannabis establishment license or adult-
107 use cannabis establishment license to submit to the Board the physical address of the proposed
108 cannabis establishment, which, among other requirements, must not be within a certain
109 distance of a public or private school or community facility. (NRS 678B.210, 678B.250)
110 Sections 32 and 35 establish definitions of “public school” and “private school” and revise
111 the definition of “community facility.”
112 Section 36 of this bill revises certain requirements for cannabis independent testing
113 laboratories.
114 Existing law deems the issuance of a license by the Board to be conditional in certain
115 local governmental jurisdictions until the cannabis establishment is in compliance with
116 applicable local governmental ordinances or rules and the local government has issued a
117 business license for the operation of the establishment. (NRS 678B.320) Section 37
118 additionally deems the issuance of such a license to be conditional until the cannabis
119 establishment satisfies an inspection conducted by the Board.
120 Existing law prohibits a cannabis establishment from dispensing or selling cannabis or
121 cannabis products from a vending machine or allowing such a vending machine to be installed
122 on the premises of the cannabis establishment. (NRS 678B.510) Section 39 of this bill
123 [authorizes a cannabis establishment to engage in such activities upon the approval of the
124 Board.] removes that prohibition. Section 39 additionally revises the procedures that the
125 operating documents of a cannabis establishment are required to include.
126 [Existing law authorizes a medical cannabis production facility to: (1) acquire hemp or a
127 commodity or product made using hemp from a grower or handler registered by the State
128 Department of Agriculture; and (2) use hemp or a commodity or product made using hemp to
129 manufacture medical cannabis products. (NRS 687C.410) Sections 40 and 43 of this bill
130 instead authorize any cannabis production facility to: (1) acquire hemp from any source
131 approved by the Board; (2) use hemp to manufacture cannabis products; and (3) sell to a

Assembly Amendment No. 173 to Assembly Bill No. 76 Page 6
132 cannabis sales facility a cannabis product that contains hemp. Section 40 additionally
133 authorizes a cannabis sales facility to acquire hemp or a commodity or product made using
134 hemp from any source approved by the Board and to sell hemp or any cannabis product that
135 contains hemp, in addition to any commodity or product made using hemp.]
136 Section 40 of this bill revises certain restrictions on advertising engaged in and
137 packaging used by a cannabis establishment.
138 Existing law prohibits a person from selling, offering to sell, appearing to sell or
139 advertising the sale of cannabis or cannabis products unless the person holds an adult-use
140 cannabis establishment license or medical cannabis establishment license. (NRS 678B.530)
141 Section 41 of this bill prohibits those actions only if the person does not have the appropriate
142 type of license and additionally prohibits a person from advertising as a cannabis sales facility
143 or cannabis consumption lounge without the appropriate type of license.
144 Existing law exempts an employee of the State Department of Agriculture from state
145 prosecution for certain offenses relating to cannabis under certain circumstances. (NRS
146 678B.600) Section 42 of this bill expands that exemption to also include an employee of the
147 Board and an attorney who represents the Department or the Board.
148 Existing law provides an exemption from state prosecution for the possession, delivery
149 and production of cannabis for: (1) a person who holds a valid registry identification card or
150 letter of approval; and (2) a person who is 21 years of age or older. However, under existing
151 law, that exemption is subject to certain limitations. For example, with respect to usable
152 cannabis, the exemption applies only to the extent that a person does not, at any one time,
153 possess, deliver or produce more than 2.5 ounces of usable cannabis. (NRS 678C.200,
154 678D.200) Existing law also prohibits a cannabis sales facility from selling to a person, in any
155 one transaction, more than 2.5 ounces of usable cannabis. (NRS 678B.550) Sections 3, 7 and
156 56 of this bill revise the definition of “usable cannabis” to exclude the seeds of a plant of the
157 genus plant Cannabis and [applies] apply this definition throughout the provisions of existing
158 law governing the medical and adult use of cannabis. Section 47 of this bill makes a
159 conforming change to eliminate a reference to a provision that has been repealed in section
160 56.
161 Existing law requires a medical cannabis establishment to maintain an electronic
162 verification system. (NRS 678B.210, 678C.420) Section 9 of this bill changes the name of
163 such a system to an electronic verification and authentication system. Section 44 of this bill
164 revises requirements concerning the operation of such a system.
165 Existing law requires an adult-use cannabis product to be sold in a single package. (NRS
166 678D.420) Section 48 of this bill revises requirements concerning the amount of usable
167 cannabis , concentrated cannabis or THC that a single package may contain.
168 Existing law, with certain exceptions, prohibits smoking in any form within indoor places
169 of employment. (NRS 202.2483) Section 51 of this bill clarifies that the smoking of cannabis
170 in a cannabis consumption lounge in accordance with the provisions of existing law governing
171 the medical and adult-use of cannabis is not prohibited.

33 improper the admission of such evidence over objection in a civil action.

4 and section 2 of chapter 391, Statutes of Nevada 2013 and unless otherwise
5 declared by law to be confidential, all public books and public records of a
6 governmental entity must be open at all times during office hours to inspection by
7 any person, and may be fully copied or an abstract or memorandum may be
8 prepared from those public books and public records. Any such copies, abstracts or
9 memoranda may be used to supply the general public with copies, abstracts or
10 memoranda of the records or may be used in any other way to the advantage of the
11 governmental entity or of the general public. This section does not supersede or in
12 any manner affect the federal laws governing copyrights or enlarge, diminish or
13 affect in any other manner the rights of a person in any written book or record
14 which is copyrighted pursuant to federal law.
15 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record which is
16 copyrighted solely because it is copyrighted.
17 3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a public book or
18 record shall not deny a request made pursuant to subsection 1 to inspect or copy or
19 receive a copy of a public book or record on the basis that the requested public
20 book or record contains information that is confidential if the governmental entity
21 can redact, delete, conceal or separate, including, without limitation, electronically,
22 the confidential information from the information included in the public book or
23 record that is not otherwise confidential.
24 4. If requested, a governmental entity shall provide a copy of a public record
25 in an electronic format by means of an electronic medium. Nothing in this
26 subsection requires a governmental entity to provide a copy of a public record in an
27 electronic format or by means of an electronic medium if:
28 (a) The public record:
29 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
30 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
31 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by means of an
32 electronic medium would:
33 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
34 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential and that
35 cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from information that is not
36 otherwise confidential.
37 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who has legal
38 custody or control of a public record:
39 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the medium that
40 is requested because the officer, employee or agent has already prepared or would
41 prefer to provide the copy in a different medium.
42 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon request, prepare
43 the copy of the public record and shall not require the person who has requested the
44 copy to prepare the copy himself or herself.
45 Sec. 54. NRS 239.0115 is hereby amended to read as follows:
46 239.0115 1. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection and subsection
47 3, notwithstanding any provision of law that has declared a public book or record,
48 or a part thereof, to be confidential, if a public book or record has been in the legal
49 custody or control of one or more governmental entities for at least 30 years, a
50 person may apply to the district court of the county in which the governmental
51 entity that currently has legal custody or control of the public book or record is
52 located for an order directing that governmental entity to allow the person to
53 inspect or copy the public book or record, or a part thereof. If the public book or

Assembly Amendment No. 173 to Assembly Bill No. 76 Page 44
1 record pertains to a natural person, a person may not apply for an order pursuant to
2 this subsection until the public book or record has been in the legal custody or
3 control of one or more governmental entities for at least 30 years or until the death
4 of the person to whom the public book or record pertains, whichever is later.
5 2. There is a rebuttable presumption that a person who applies for an order as
6 described in subsection 1 is entitled to inspect or copy the public book or record, or
7 a part thereof, that the person seeks to inspect or copy.
8 3. The provisions of subsection 1 do not apply to any book or record:
9 (a) Declared confidential pursuant to NRS 463.120 [.] or 678A.470.
10 (b) Containing personal information pertaining to a victim of crime that has
11 been declared by law to be confidential.
12 Sec. 55. The amendatory provisions of sections 5, 6 and 13 to 23, inclusive,
13 of this act apply to any judicial or administrative proceedings commenced on or
14 after the effective date of this act.
15 Sec. 56. NRS 678C.060, 678C.100 [,] and 678D.040 [and 678D.410] are
16 hereby repealed.
17 Sec. 57. This act becomes effective upon passage and approval.
