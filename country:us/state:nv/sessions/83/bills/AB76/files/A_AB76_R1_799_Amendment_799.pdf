Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of persons and establishments
2 involved in the cannabis industry in this State by the Cannabis Compliance Board. (Title 56 of
3 NRS) Existing law sets forth procedures by which the Board may take disciplinary action
4 against a licensee or registrant. (NRS 678A.500-678A.600) Under existing law, the Executive
5 Director of the Board is authorized to transmit the details of any suspected violation of the
6 provisions of existing law and regulations that govern the medical and adult use of cannabis to
7 the Attorney General for an investigation. (NRS 678A.500) After the investigation, existing
8 law requires the Board to determine whether to proceed with disciplinary action against a
9 licensee or registrant. (NRS 678A.510) If the Board proceeds with disciplinary action,
10 existing law: (1) requires the Board or the Executive Director to serve a complaint upon the
11 respondent; and (2) sets forth procedures for the conduct of a disciplinary hearing before the
12 Board. (NRS 678A.520-678A.590) If the Board determines that a licensee or registrant has
13 violated a provision of existing law or regulations governing the medical and adult use of

Assembly Amendment No. 799 to Assembly Bill No. 76 First Reprint Page 4
14 cannabis, existing law authorizes the Board to impose certain penalties against the licensee or
15 registrant. (NRS 678A.600)
16 Sections 6 and 13-24 of this bill revise the procedures by which disciplinary action may
17 be taken against a licensee or registrant. Section 13 specifies that the Executive Director is
18 authorized to transmit the details of a suspected violation to the Attorney General for further
19 investigation. Section 24 makes a conforming change to reflect the fact that an investigation
20 of a violation is commenced by the Executive Director, rather than the Board. Section 14
21 revises the actions the Board must take with respect to each complaint resulting in an
22 investigation by the Attorney General. Section 15 revises the required content of a complaint
23 served by the Board or the Executive Director and the time in which the respondent may
24 answer the complaint. Upon receipt of an answer demanding a hearing or the expiration of the
25 time to answer the complaint, section 15 requires the Board to assign the matter to a hearing
26 officer. Sections 15-23 require a disciplinary hearing to be heard before a hearing officer,
27 rather than the Board, and revise procedures for the conduct of such a hearing. Section 6: (1)
28 provides that the decision and order of a hearing officer is final unless a party aggrieved by
29 the decision requests that the Board review the decision and order or the Board initiates such a
30 review on its own motion; and (2) sets forth procedures for the conduct of a review by the
31 Board. Section 23 provides that any person aggrieved by a final decision or order of the Board
32 after a review conducted pursuant to section 6 is entitled to judicial review of the decision or
33 order.
34 Section 5 of this bill requires the Board to appoint one or more hearing officers to
35 conduct disciplinary hearings and render decisions.
36 Section 26 of this bill authorizes the Board, the Executive Director or a designee of the
37 Executive Director to issue a letter of warning, a letter of concern or a nonpunitive
38 admonishment under certain circumstances.
39 Existing law requires the Board to adopt regulations providing for the investigation of
40 unlicensed cannabis activities and the imposition of penalties against persons who engage in
41 such activities. (NRS 678A.450) Section 11 of this bill authorizes the Board to issue
42 summonses and subpoenas and to take certain other actions in connection with such an
43 investigation.
44 Sections 4, 12 and 54 of this bill revise provisions relating to the confidentiality of
45 certain information obtained by the Board. Existing law authorizes the Governor or his or her
46 designee to enter into one or more agreements with tribal governments concerning cannabis.
47 (NRS 223.250) Sections 52 and 53 of this bill provide that certain information received by a
48 governmental entity from a tribal government or a facility engaged in cannabis activities
49 operating on tribal land pursuant to the terms of such an agreement remains the property of the
50 tribal government, does not constitute a public record and must be kept confidential by the
51 governmental entity.
52 Sections 2, 7, 33, 34, 37 and 38 of this bill establish a standardized definition of the term
53 “local governmental jurisdiction” for the purposes of provisions governing the medical and
54 adult use of cannabis.
55 Existing law authorizes the Board to adopt regulations setting forth requirements
56 relating to the packaging and labeling of cannabis and cannabis products. (NRS
57 678A.450) Section 11 prohibits those requirements from requiring: (1) a package of
58 cannabis or cannabis products which is sold at wholesale to contain any label or tag
59 other than a label or tag necessary for the functionality of any computer software used
60 for the seed-to-sale tracking of cannabis; and (2) a cannabis establishment to include any
61 information on the label for any cannabis or a cannabis product that is already included
62 on the packaging of the cannabis or cannabis product. Sections 1.5 and 2.5 of this bill
63 define the terms “label” and “packaging” for the purposes of provisions of existing law
64 governing the medical and adult use of cannabis.
65 Existing law prohibits the production, distribution and sale of any synthetic cannabinoid.
66 (NRS 453.572, 557.255, 678B.525) Section 10 of this bill revises the definition of “synthetic
67 cannabinoid” to: (1) specify that any cannabinoid that is either produced artificially or not
68 obtained directly without the use of a chemical reagent from a plant of the genus Cannabis
69 constitutes a synthetic cannabinoid; and (2) exclude THC produced using certain processes.
70 Existing law requires a cannabis establishment to use an inventory control system. (NRS
71 678B.210, 678B.250, 678C.430) Existing law sets forth certain requirements for the operation
72 of such a system by a medical cannabis establishment. (NRS [678B.430)] 678C.430) Sections

Assembly Amendment No. 799 to Assembly Bill No. 76 First Reprint Page 5
73 27, 31, 32, 35 and 45 of this bill revise those requirements and additionally apply the
74 requirements to the operation of such a system by an adult-use cannabis establishment.
75 Sections 45 and 49 of this bill revise requirements for a dual licensee concerning the
76 reporting of inventory.
77 Existing law sets forth procedures by which a health authority, upon finding a condition
78 in the operation of a food establishment constituting a substantial hazard to the public health,
79 may issue an order to the holder of the permit to operate the food establishment that may
80 require the immediate suspension of the permit and discontinuance of all food operations.
81 (NRS 446.880) Section 30 of this bill sets forth similar procedures by which an agent of the
82 Board may issue such an order to the holder of a cannabis establishment license if the agent
83 finds a condition in the operation of the cannabis establishment which constitutes a substantial
84 hazard to the public health. Section 30 sets forth certain conditions under which such an order
85 may not order the immediate suspension of the license and the immediate discontinuance of
86 the operations of the cannabis establishment. Section 29 of this bill defines “substantial
87 hazard to the public health” to include certain specified conditions. Section 29 additionally
88 requires the Board to adopt certain regulations concerning substantial hazards to the public
89 health which may exist at a cannabis establishment.
90 Existing law requires an applicant for a medical cannabis establishment license or adult-
91 use cannabis establishment license to submit to the Board the physical address of the proposed
92 cannabis establishment, which, among other requirements, must not be within a certain
93 distance of a public or private school or community facility. (NRS 678B.210, 678B.250)
94 Sections 32 and 35 establish definitions of “public school” and “private school” and revise
95 the definition of “community facility.”
96 Section 36 of this bill revises certain requirements for cannabis independent testing
97 laboratories.
98 Existing law deems the issuance of a license by the Board to be conditional in certain
99 local governmental jurisdictions until the cannabis establishment is in compliance with
100 applicable local governmental ordinances or rules and the local government has issued a
101 business license for the operation of the establishment. (NRS 678B.320) Section 37
102 additionally deems the issuance of such a license to be conditional until the cannabis
103 establishment satisfies an inspection conducted by the Board.
104 [Existing law prohibits a cannabis establishment from dispensing or selling cannabis or
105 cannabis products from a vending machine or allowing such a vending machine to be installed
106 on the premises of the cannabis establishment. (NRS 678B.510)] Section 39 of this bill
107 [removes that prohibition. Section 39 additionally] revises the procedures that the operating
108 documents of a cannabis establishment are required to include [.] to additionally include
109 certain procedures relating to the training of cannabis establishment agents and other
110 procedures established by the Board by regulation. (NRS 678B.510)
111 Section 40 of this bill revises certain restrictions on advertising engaged in and packaging
112 used by a cannabis establishment.
113 Existing law prohibits a person from selling, offering to sell, appearing to sell or
114 advertising the sale of cannabis or cannabis products unless the person holds an adult-use
115 cannabis establishment license or medical cannabis establishment license. (NRS 678B.530)
116 Section 41 of this bill prohibits those actions only if the person does not have the appropriate
117 type of license and additionally prohibits a person from advertising as a cannabis sales facility
118 or cannabis consumption lounge without the appropriate type of license.
119 Existing law exempts an employee of the State Department of Agriculture from state
120 prosecution for certain offenses relating to cannabis under certain circumstances. (NRS
121 678B.600) Section 42 of this bill expands that exemption to also include an employee of the
122 Board and an attorney who represents the Department or the Board.
123 Existing law provides an exemption from state prosecution for the possession, delivery
124 and production of cannabis for: (1) a person who holds a valid registry identification card or
125 letter of approval; and (2) a person who is 21 years of age or older. However, under existing
126 law, that exemption is subject to certain limitations. For example, with respect to usable
127 cannabis, the exemption applies only to the extent that a person does not, at any one time,
128 possess, deliver or produce more than 2.5 ounces of usable cannabis. (NRS 678C.200,
129 678D.200) Existing law also prohibits a cannabis sales facility from selling to a person, in any
130 one transaction, more than 2.5 ounces of usable cannabis. (NRS 678B.550) Sections 3, 7 and
131 56 of this bill revise the definition of “usable cannabis” to exclude the seeds of a plant of the

Assembly Amendment No. 799 to Assembly Bill No. 76 First Reprint Page 6
132 genus plant Cannabis and apply this definition throughout the provisions of existing law
133 governing the medical and adult use of cannabis. Section 47 of this bill makes a conforming
134 change to eliminate a reference to a provision that has been repealed in section 56.
135 Existing law requires a medical cannabis establishment to maintain an electronic
136 verification system. (NRS 678B.210, 678C.420) Section 9 of this bill changes the name of
137 such a system to an electronic verification and authentication system. Section 44 of this bill
138 revises requirements concerning the operation of such a system.
139 Existing law requires an adult-use cannabis product to be sold in a single package. (NRS
140 678D.420) Section 48 of this bill revises requirements concerning the amount of usable
141 cannabis, concentrated cannabis or THC that a single package may contain.
142 Existing law, with certain exceptions, prohibits smoking in any form within indoor places
143 of employment. (NRS 202.2483) Section 51 of this bill clarifies that the smoking of cannabis
144 in a cannabis consumption lounge in accordance with the provisions of existing law governing
145 the medical and adult-use of cannabis is not prohibited.
146 Section 54.3 of this bill requires the Cannabis Advisory Commission to create a
147 subcommittee to conduct a study concerning certain matters relating to sales of
148 consumable hemp products in this State. Section 54.7 of this bill additionally requires
149 the Commission to create a subcommittee to conduct a study concerning the manner in
150 which cannabis and cannabis products are taxed in this State.

18 declared by law to be confidential, all public books and public records of a
19 governmental entity must be open at all times during office hours to inspection by
20 any person, and may be fully copied or an abstract or memorandum may be
21 prepared from those public books and public records. Any such copies, abstracts or
22 memoranda may be used to supply the general public with copies, abstracts or
23 memoranda of the records or may be used in any other way to the advantage of the
24 governmental entity or of the general public. This section does not supersede or in
25 any manner affect the federal laws governing copyrights or enlarge, diminish or
26 affect in any other manner the rights of a person in any written book or record
27 which is copyrighted pursuant to federal law.
28 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record which is
29 copyrighted solely because it is copyrighted.
30 3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a public book or
31 record shall not deny a request made pursuant to subsection 1 to inspect or copy or
32 receive a copy of a public book or record on the basis that the requested public
33 book or record contains information that is confidential if the governmental entity
34 can redact, delete, conceal or separate, including, without limitation, electronically,
35 the confidential information from the information included in the public book or
36 record that is not otherwise confidential.
37 4. If requested, a governmental entity shall provide a copy of a public record
38 in an electronic format by means of an electronic medium. Nothing in this
39 subsection requires a governmental entity to provide a copy of a public record in an
40 electronic format or by means of an electronic medium if:
41 (a) The public record:
42 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
43 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
44 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by means of an
45 electronic medium would:
46 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
47 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential and that
48 cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from information that is not
49 otherwise confidential.
50 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who has legal
51 custody or control of a public record:

Assembly Amendment No. 799 to Assembly Bill No. 76 First Reprint Page 41
1 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the medium that
2 is requested because the officer, employee or agent has already prepared or would
3 prefer to provide the copy in a different medium.
4 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon request, prepare
5 the copy of the public record and shall not require the person who has requested the
6 copy to prepare the copy himself or herself.
7 Sec. 54. NRS 239.0115 is hereby amended to read as follows:
8 239.0115 1. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection and subsection
9 3, notwithstanding any provision of law that has declared a public book or record,
10 or a part thereof, to be confidential, if a public book or record has been in the legal
11 custody or control of one or more governmental entities for at least 30 years, a
12 person may apply to the district court of the county in which the governmental
13 entity that currently has legal custody or control of the public book or record is
14 located for an order directing that governmental entity to allow the person to
15 inspect or copy the public book or record, or a part thereof. If the public book or
16 record pertains to a natural person, a person may not apply for an order pursuant to
17 this subsection until the public book or record has been in the legal custody or
18 control of one or more governmental entities for at least 30 years or until the death
19 of the person to whom the public book or record pertains, whichever is later.
20 2. There is a rebuttable presumption that a person who applies for an order as
21 described in subsection 1 is entitled to inspect or copy the public book or record, or
22 a part thereof, that the person seeks to inspect or copy.
23 3. The provisions of subsection 1 do not apply to any book or record:
24 (a) Declared confidential pursuant to NRS 463.120 [.] or 678A.470.
25 (b) Containing personal information pertaining to a victim of crime that has
26 been declared by law to be confidential.

46 (2) An identification and recommendations for the closure of gaps in
47 the enforcement of such restrictions, including, without limitation, gaps in the
48 legal authority of state and local agencies to enforce such restrictions and gaps
49 in the enforcement of such restrictions in the context of sales conducted in
50 person and through the Internet and with respect to sales of consumable hemp
51 products that contain delta-8-tetrahydrocannabinol, other derivatives of
52 tetrahydrocannabinol or synthetic cannabinoids;

Assembly Amendment No. 799 to Assembly Bill No. 76 First Reprint Page 42
