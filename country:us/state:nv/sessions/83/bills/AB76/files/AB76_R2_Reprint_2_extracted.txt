Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of persons and
2 establishments involved in the cannabis industry in this State by the Cannabis
3 Compliance Board. (Title 56 of NRS) Existing law sets forth procedures by which
4 the Board may take disciplinary action against a licensee or registrant. (NRS
5 678A.500-678A.600) Under existing law, the Executive Director of the Board is
-
*AB76_R2*
– 2 –
6 authorized to transmit the details of any suspected violation of the provisions of
7 existing law and regulations that govern the medical and adult use of cannabis to
8 the Attorney General for an investigation. (NRS 678A.500) After the investigation,
9 existing law requires the Board to determine whether to proceed with disciplinary
10 action against a licensee or registrant. (NRS 678A.510) If the Board proceeds with
11 disciplinary action, existing law: (1) requires the Board or the Executive Director to
12 serve a complaint upon the respondent; and (2) sets forth procedures for the
13 conduct of a disciplinary hearing before the Board. (NRS 678A.520-678A.590) If
14 the Board determines that a licensee or registrant has violated a provision of
15 existing law or regulations governing the medical and adult use of cannabis,
16 existing law authorizes the Board to impose certain penalties against the licensee or
17 registrant. (NRS 678A.600)
18 Sections 6 and 13-24 of this bill revise the procedures by which disciplinary
19 action may be taken against a licensee or registrant. Section 13 specifies that the
20 Executive Director is authorized to transmit the details of a suspected violation to
21 the Attorney General for further investigation. Section 24 makes a conforming
22 change to reflect the fact that an investigation of a violation is commenced by the
23 Executive Director, rather than the Board. Section 14 revises the actions the Board
24 must take with respect to each complaint resulting in an investigation by the
25 Attorney General. Section 15 revises the required content of a complaint served by
26 the Board or the Executive Director and the time in which the respondent may
27 answer the complaint. Upon receipt of an answer demanding a hearing or the
28 expiration of the time to answer the complaint, section 15 requires the Board to
29 assign the matter to a hearing officer. Sections 15-23 require a disciplinary hearing
30 to be heard before a hearing officer, rather than the Board, and revise procedures
31 for the conduct of such a hearing. Section 6: (1) provides that the decision and
32 order of a hearing officer is final unless a party aggrieved by the decision requests
33 that the Board review the decision and order or the Board initiates such a review on
34 its own motion; and (2) sets forth procedures for the conduct of a review by the
35 Board. Section 23 provides that any person aggrieved by a final decision or order
36 of the Board after a review conducted pursuant to section 6 is entitled to judicial
37 review of the decision or order.
38 Section 5 of this bill requires the Board to appoint one or more hearing officers
39 to conduct disciplinary hearings and render decisions.
40 Section 26 of this bill authorizes the Board, the Executive Director or a
41 designee of the Executive Director to issue a letter of warning, a letter of concern or
42 a nonpunitive admonishment under certain circumstances.
43 Existing law requires the Board to adopt regulations providing for the
44 investigation of unlicensed cannabis activities and the imposition of penalties
45 against persons who engage in such activities. (NRS 678A.450) Section 11 of this
46 bill authorizes the Board to issue summonses and subpoenas and to take certain
47 other actions in connection with such an investigation.
48 Sections 4, 12 and 54 of this bill revise provisions relating to the
49 confidentiality of certain information obtained by the Board. Existing law
50 authorizes the Governor or his or her designee to enter into one or more agreements
51 with tribal governments concerning cannabis. (NRS 223.250) Sections 52 and 53
52 of this bill provide that certain information received by a governmental entity from
53 a tribal government or a facility engaged in cannabis activities operating on tribal
54 land pursuant to the terms of such an agreement remains the property of the tribal
55 government, does not constitute a public record and must be kept confidential by
56 the governmental entity.
57 Sections 2, 7, 33, 34, 37 and 38 of this bill establish a standardized definition
58 of the term “local governmental jurisdiction” for the purposes of provisions
59 governing the medical and adult use of cannabis.

60 Existing law authorizes the Board to adopt regulations setting forth
61 requirements relating to the packaging and labeling of cannabis and cannabis
62 products. (NRS 678A.450) Section 11 prohibits those requirements from requiring:
63 (1) a package of cannabis or cannabis products which is sold at wholesale to
64 contain any label or tag other than a label or tag necessary for the functionality of
65 any computer software used for the seed-to-sale tracking of cannabis; and (2) a
66 cannabis establishment to include any information on the label for any cannabis or
67 a cannabis product that is already included on the packaging of the cannabis or
68 cannabis product. Sections 1.5 and 2.5 of this bill define the terms “label” and
69 “packaging” for the purposes of provisions of existing law governing the medical
70 and adult use of cannabis.
71 Existing law prohibits the production, distribution and sale of any synthetic
72 cannabinoid. (NRS 453.572, 557.255, 678B.525) Section 10 of this bill revises the
73 definition of “synthetic cannabinoid” to: (1) specify that any cannabinoid that is
74 either produced artificially or not obtained directly without the use of a chemical
75 reagent from a plant of the genus Cannabis constitutes a synthetic cannabinoid; and
76 (2) exclude THC produced using certain processes.
77 Existing law requires a cannabis establishment to use an inventory control
78 system. (NRS 678B.210, 678B.250, 678C.430) Existing law sets forth certain
79 requirements for the operation of such a system by a medical cannabis
80 establishment. (NRS 678C.430) Sections 27, 31, 32, 35 and 45 of this bill revise
81 those requirements and additionally apply the requirements to the operation of such
82 a system by an adult-use cannabis establishment. Sections 45 and 49 of this bill
83 revise requirements for a dual licensee concerning the reporting of inventory.
84 Existing law sets forth procedures by which a health authority, upon finding a
85 condition in the operation of a food establishment constituting a substantial hazard
86 to the public health, may issue an order to the holder of the permit to operate the
87 food establishment that may require the immediate suspension of the permit and
88 discontinuance of all food operations. (NRS 446.880) Section 30 of this bill sets
89 forth similar procedures by which an agent of the Board may issue such an order to
90 the holder of a cannabis establishment license if the agent finds a condition in the
91 operation of the cannabis establishment which constitutes a substantial hazard to
92 the public health. Section 30 sets forth certain conditions under which such an
93 order may not order the immediate suspension of the license and the immediate
94 discontinuance of the operations of the cannabis establishment. Section 29 of this
95 bill defines “substantial hazard to the public health” to include certain specified
96 conditions. Section 29 additionally requires the Board to adopt certain regulations
97 concerning substantial hazards to the public health which may exist at a cannabis
98 establishment.
99 Existing law requires an applicant for a medical cannabis establishment license
100 or adult-use cannabis establishment license to submit to the Board the physical
101 address of the proposed cannabis establishment, which, among other requirements,
102 must not be within a certain distance of a public or private school or community
103 facility. (NRS 678B.210, 678B.250) Sections 32 and 35 establish definitions of
104 “public school” and “private school” and revise the definition of “community
105 facility.”
106 Section 36 of this bill revises certain requirements for cannabis independent
107 testing laboratories.
108 Existing law deems the issuance of a license by the Board to be conditional in
109 certain local governmental jurisdictions until the cannabis establishment is in
110 compliance with applicable local governmental ordinances or rules and the local
111 government has issued a business license for the operation of the establishment.
112 (NRS 678B.320) Section 37 additionally deems the issuance of such a license to be
113 conditional until the cannabis establishment satisfies an inspection conducted by
114 the Board.

115 Section 39 of this bill revises the procedures that the operating documents of a
116 cannabis establishment are required to include to additionally include certain
117 procedures relating to the training of cannabis establishment agents and other
118 procedures established by the Board by regulation. (NRS 678B.510)
119 Section 40 of this bill revises certain restrictions on advertising engaged in and
120 packaging used by a cannabis establishment.
121 Existing law prohibits a person from selling, offering to sell, appearing to sell
122 or advertising the sale of cannabis or cannabis products unless the person holds an
123 adult-use cannabis establishment license or medical cannabis establishment license.
124 (NRS 678B.530) Section 41 of this bill prohibits those actions only if the person
125 does not have the appropriate type of license and additionally prohibits a person
126 from advertising as a cannabis sales facility or cannabis consumption lounge
127 without the appropriate type of license.
128 Existing law exempts an employee of the State Department of Agriculture from
129 state prosecution for certain offenses relating to cannabis under certain
130 circumstances. (NRS 678B.600) Section 42 of this bill expands that exemption to
131 also include an employee of the Board and an attorney who represents the
132 Department or the Board.
133 Existing law provides an exemption from state prosecution for the possession,
134 delivery and production of cannabis for: (1) a person who holds a valid registry
135 identification card or letter of approval; and (2) a person who is 21 years of age or
136 older. However, under existing law, that exemption is subject to certain limitations.
137 For example, with respect to usable cannabis, the exemption applies only to the
138 extent that a person does not, at any one time, possess, deliver or produce more
139 than 2.5 ounces of usable cannabis. (NRS 678C.200, 678D.200) Existing law also
140 prohibits a cannabis sales facility from selling to a person, in any one transaction,
141 more than 2.5 ounces of usable cannabis. (NRS 678B.550) Sections 3, 7 and 56 of
142 this bill revise the definition of “usable cannabis” to exclude the seeds of a plant of
143 the genus plant Cannabis and apply this definition throughout the provisions
144 of existing law governing the medical and adult use of cannabis. Section 47 of this
145 bill makes a conforming change to eliminate a reference to a provision that has
146 been repealed in section 56.
147 Existing law requires a medical cannabis establishment to maintain an
148 electronic verification system. (NRS 678B.210, 678C.420) Section 9 of this bill
149 changes the name of such a system to an electronic verification and authentication
150 system. Section 44 of this bill revises requirements concerning the operation of
151 such a system.
152 Existing law requires an adult-use cannabis product to be sold in a single
153 package. (NRS 678D.420) Section 48 of this bill revises requirements concerning
154 the amount of usable cannabis, concentrated cannabis or THC that a single package
155 may contain.
156 Existing law, with certain exceptions, prohibits smoking in any form within
157 indoor places of employment. (NRS 202.2483) Section 51 of this bill clarifies that
158 the smoking of cannabis in a cannabis consumption lounge in accordance with the
159 provisions of existing law governing the medical and adult-use of cannabis is not
160 prohibited.
161 Section 54.3 of this bill requires the Cannabis Advisory Commission to create a
162 subcommittee to conduct a study concerning certain matters relating to sales of
163 consumable hemp products in this State. Section 54.7 of this bill additionally
164 requires the Commission to create a subcommittee to conduct a study concerning
165 the manner in which cannabis and cannabis products are taxed in this State.

15 and public records of a governmental entity must be open at all
16 times during office hours to inspection by any person, and may be
17 fully copied or an abstract or memorandum may be prepared from

19 memoranda may be used to supply the general public with copies,
20 abstracts or memoranda of the records or may be used in any other
21 way to the advantage of the governmental entity or of the general
22 public. This section does not supersede or in any manner affect the
23 federal laws governing copyrights or enlarge, diminish or affect in
24 any other manner the rights of a person in any written book or
25 record which is copyrighted pursuant to federal law.
26 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record
27 which is copyrighted solely because it is copyrighted.
28 3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a
29 public book or record shall not deny a request made pursuant to
30 subsection 1 to inspect or copy or receive a copy of a public book or
31 record on the basis that the requested public book or record contains
32 information that is confidential if the governmental entity can

34 electronically, the confidential information from the information
35 included in the public book or record that is not otherwise
36 confidential.
37 4. If requested, a governmental entity shall provide a copy of a
38 public record in an electronic format by means of an electronic
39 medium. Nothing in this subsection requires a governmental entity
40 to provide a copy of a public record in an electronic format or by
41 means of an electronic medium if:
42 (a) The public record:
43 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
44 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
-

– 53 –
1 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by
2 means of an electronic medium would:
3 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
4 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential
5 and that cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from
6 information that is not otherwise confidential.
7 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who
8 has legal custody or control of a public record:
9 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the

11 already prepared or would prefer to provide the copy in a different
12 medium.
13 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon
14 request, prepare the copy of the public record and shall not require
15 the person who has requested the copy to prepare the copy himself
16 or herself.
17 Sec. 54. NRS 239.0115 is hereby amended to read as follows:
18 239.0115 1. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection
19 and subsection 3, notwithstanding any provision of law that has
20 declared a public book or record, or a part thereof, to be
21 confidential, if a public book or record has been in the legal custody
22 or control of one or more governmental entities for at least 30 years,
23 a person may apply to the district court of the county in which the
24 governmental entity that currently has legal custody or control of the
25 public book or record is located for an order directing that
26 governmental entity to allow the person to inspect or copy the public
27 book or record, or a part thereof. If the public book or record
28 pertains to a natural person, a person may not apply for an order
29 pursuant to this subsection until the public book or record has been
30 in the legal custody or control of one or more governmental entities
31 for at least 30 years or until the death of the person to whom the
32 public book or record pertains, whichever is later.
33 2. There is a rebuttable presumption that a person who applies
34 for an order as described in subsection 1 is entitled to inspect or
35 copy the public book or record, or a part thereof, that the person
36 seeks to inspect or copy.
37 3. The provisions of subsection 1 do not apply to any book or
38 record:

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of persons and
2 establishments involved in the cannabis industry in this State by the Cannabis
3 Compliance Board. (Title 56 of NRS) Existing law sets forth procedures by which
4 the Board may take disciplinary action against a licensee or registrant. (NRS
5 678A.500-678A.600) Under existing law, the Executive Director of the Board is
-
*AB76_R2*

– 2 –
6 authorized to transmit the details of any suspected violation of the provisions of
7 existing law and regulations that govern the medical and adult use of cannabis to
8 the Attorney General for an investigation. (NRS 678A.500) After the investigation,
9 existing law requires the Board to determine whether to proceed with disciplinary
10 action against a licensee or registrant. (NRS 678A.510) If the Board proceeds with
11 disciplinary action, existing law: (1) requires the Board or the Executive Director to
12 serve a complaint upon the respondent; and (2) sets forth procedures for the
13 conduct of a disciplinary hearing before the Board. (NRS 678A.520-678A.590) If
14 the Board determines that a licensee or registrant has violated a provision of
15 existing law or regulations governing the medical and adult use of cannabis,
16 existing law authorizes the Board to impose certain penalties against the licensee or
17 registrant. (NRS 678A.600)
18 Sections 6 and 13-24 of this bill revise the procedures by which disciplinary
19 action may be taken against a licensee or registrant. Section 13 specifies that the
20 Executive Director is authorized to transmit the details of a suspected violation to
21 the Attorney General for further investigation. Section 24 makes a conforming
22 change to reflect the fact that an investigation of a violation is commenced by the
23 Executive Director, rather than the Board. Section 14 revises the actions the Board
24 must take with respect to each complaint resulting in an investigation by the
25 Attorney General. Section 15 revises the required content of a complaint served by
26 the Board or the Executive Director and the time in which the respondent may
27 answer the complaint. Upon receipt of an answer demanding a hearing or the
28 expiration of the time to answer the complaint, section 15 requires the Board to
29 assign the matter to a hearing officer. Sections 15-23 require a disciplinary hearing
30 to be heard before a hearing officer, rather than the Board, and revise procedures
31 for the conduct of such a hearing. Section 6: (1) provides that the decision and
32 order of a hearing officer is final unless a party aggrieved by the decision requests
33 that the Board review the decision and order or the Board initiates such a review on
34 its own motion; and (2) sets forth procedures for the conduct of a review by the
35 Board. Section 23 provides that any person aggrieved by a final decision or order
36 of the Board after a review conducted pursuant to section 6 is entitled to judicial
37 review of the decision or order.
38 Section 5 of this bill requires the Board to appoint one or more hearing officers
39 to conduct disciplinary hearings and render decisions.
40 Section 26 of this bill authorizes the Board, the Executive Director or a
41 designee of the Executive Director to issue a letter of warning, a letter of concern or
42 a nonpunitive admonishment under certain circumstances.
43 Existing law requires the Board to adopt regulations providing for the
44 investigation of unlicensed cannabis activities and the imposition of penalties
45 against persons who engage in such activities. (NRS 678A.450) Section 11 of this
46 bill authorizes the Board to issue summonses and subpoenas and to take certain
47 other actions in connection with such an investigation.
48 Sections 4, 12 and 54 of this bill revise provisions relating to the
49 confidentiality of certain information obtained by the Board. Existing law
50 authorizes the Governor or his or her designee to enter into one or more agreements
51 with tribal governments concerning cannabis. (NRS 223.250) Sections 52 and 53
52 of this bill provide that certain information received by a governmental entity from
53 a tribal government or a facility engaged in cannabis activities operating on tribal
54 land pursuant to the terms of such an agreement remains the property of the tribal
55 government, does not constitute a public record and must be kept confidential by
56 the governmental entity.
57 Sections 2, 7, 33, 34, 37 and 38 of this bill establish a standardized definition
58 of the term “local governmental jurisdiction” for the purposes of provisions
59 governing the medical and adult use of cannabis.
-
*AB76_R2*

– 3 –
60 Existing law authorizes the Board to adopt regulations setting forth
61 requirements relating to the packaging and labeling of cannabis and cannabis
62 products. (NRS 678A.450) Section 11 prohibits those requirements from requiring:
63 (1) a package of cannabis or cannabis products which is sold at wholesale to
64 contain any label or tag other than a label or tag necessary for the functionality of
65 any computer software used for the seed-to-sale tracking of cannabis; and (2) a
66 cannabis establishment to include any information on the label for any cannabis or
67 a cannabis product that is already included on the packaging of the cannabis or
68 cannabis product. Sections 1.5 and 2.5 of this bill define the terms “label” and
69 “packaging” for the purposes of provisions of existing law governing the medical
70 and adult use of cannabis.
71 Existing law prohibits the production, distribution and sale of any synthetic
72 cannabinoid. (NRS 453.572, 557.255, 678B.525) Section 10 of this bill revises the
73 definition of “synthetic cannabinoid” to: (1) specify that any cannabinoid that is
74 either produced artificially or not obtained directly without the use of a chemical
75 reagent from a plant of the genus Cannabis constitutes a synthetic cannabinoid; and
76 (2) exclude THC produced using certain processes.
77 Existing law requires a cannabis establishment to use an inventory control
78 system. (NRS 678B.210, 678B.250, 678C.430) Existing law sets forth certain
79 requirements for the operation of such a system by a medical cannabis
80 establishment. (NRS 678C.430) Sections 27, 31, 32, 35 and 45 of this bill revise
81 those requirements and additionally apply the requirements to the operation of such
82 a system by an adult-use cannabis establishment. Sections 45 and 49 of this bill
83 revise requirements for a dual licensee concerning the reporting of inventory.
84 Existing law sets forth procedures by which a health authority, upon finding a
85 condition in the operation of a food establishment constituting a substantial hazard
86 to the public health, may issue an order to the holder of the permit to operate the
87 food establishment that may require the immediate suspension of the permit and
88 discontinuance of all food operations. (NRS 446.880) Section 30 of this bill sets
89 forth similar procedures by which an agent of the Board may issue such an order to
90 the holder of a cannabis establishment license if the agent finds a condition in the
91 operation of the cannabis establishment which constitutes a substantial hazard to
92 the public health. Section 30 sets forth certain conditions under which such an
93 order may not order the immediate suspension of the license and the immediate
94 discontinuance of the operations of the cannabis establishment. Section 29 of this
95 bill defines “substantial hazard to the public health” to include certain specified
96 conditions. Section 29 additionally requires the Board to adopt certain regulations
97 concerning substantial hazards to the public health which may exist at a cannabis
98 establishment.
99 Existing law requires an applicant for a medical cannabis establishment license
100 or adult-use cannabis establishment license to submit to the Board the physical
101 address of the proposed cannabis establishment, which, among other requirements,
102 must not be within a certain distance of a public or private school or community
103 facility. (NRS 678B.210, 678B.250) Sections 32 and 35 establish definitions of
104 “public school” and “private school” and revise the definition of “community
105 facility.”
106 Section 36 of this bill revises certain requirements for cannabis independent
107 testing laboratories.
108 Existing law deems the issuance of a license by the Board to be conditional in
109 certain local governmental jurisdictions until the cannabis establishment is in
110 compliance with applicable local governmental ordinances or rules and the local
111 government has issued a business license for the operation of the establishment.
112 (NRS 678B.320) Section 37 additionally deems the issuance of such a license to be
113 conditional until the cannabis establishment satisfies an inspection conducted by
114 the Board.
-
*AB76_R2*

– 4 –
115 Section 39 of this bill revises the procedures that the operating documents of a
116 cannabis establishment are required to include to additionally include certain
117 procedures relating to the training of cannabis establishment agents and other
118 procedures established by the Board by regulation. (NRS 678B.510)
119 Section 40 of this bill revises certain restrictions on advertising engaged in and
120 packaging used by a cannabis establishment.
121 Existing law prohibits a person from selling, offering to sell, appearing to sell
122 or advertising the sale of cannabis or cannabis products unless the person holds an
123 adult-use cannabis establishment license or medical cannabis establishment license.
124 (NRS 678B.530) Section 41 of this bill prohibits those actions only if the person
125 does not have the appropriate type of license and additionally prohibits a person
126 from advertising as a cannabis sales facility or cannabis consumption lounge
127 without the appropriate type of license.
128 Existing law exempts an employee of the State Department of Agriculture from
129 state prosecution for certain offenses relating to cannabis under certain
130 circumstances. (NRS 678B.600) Section 42 of this bill expands that exemption to
131 also include an employee of the Board and an attorney who represents the
132 Department or the Board.
133 Existing law provides an exemption from state prosecution for the possession,
134 delivery and production of cannabis for: (1) a person who holds a valid registry
135 identification card or letter of approval; and (2) a person who is 21 years of age or
136 older. However, under existing law, that exemption is subject to certain limitations.
137 For example, with respect to usable cannabis, the exemption applies only to the
138 extent that a person does not, at any one time, possess, deliver or produce more
139 than 2.5 ounces of usable cannabis. (NRS 678C.200, 678D.200) Existing law also
140 prohibits a cannabis sales facility from selling to a person, in any one transaction,
141 more than 2.5 ounces of usable cannabis. (NRS 678B.550) Sections 3, 7 and 56 of
142 this bill revise the definition of “usable cannabis” to exclude the seeds of a plant of
143 the genus plant Cannabis and apply this definition throughout the provisions
144 of existing law governing the medical and adult use of cannabis. Section 47 of this
145 bill makes a conforming change to eliminate a reference to a provision that has
146 been repealed in section 56.
147 Existing law requires a medical cannabis establishment to maintain an
148 electronic verification system. (NRS 678B.210, 678C.420) Section 9 of this bill
149 changes the name of such a system to an electronic verification and authentication
150 system. Section 44 of this bill revises requirements concerning the operation of
151 such a system.
152 Existing law requires an adult-use cannabis product to be sold in a single
153 package. (NRS 678D.420) Section 48 of this bill revises requirements concerning
154 the amount of usable cannabis, concentrated cannabis or THC that a single package
155 may contain.
156 Existing law, with certain exceptions, prohibits smoking in any form within
157 indoor places of employment. (NRS 202.2483) Section 51 of this bill clarifies that
158 the smoking of cannabis in a cannabis consumption lounge in accordance with the
159 provisions of existing law governing the medical and adult-use of cannabis is not
160 prohibited.
161 Section 54.3 of this bill requires the Cannabis Advisory Commission to create a
162 subcommittee to conduct a study concerning certain matters relating to sales of
163 consumable hemp products in this State. Section 54.7 of this bill additionally
164 requires the Commission to create a subcommittee to conduct a study concerning
165 the manner in which cannabis and cannabis products are taxed in this State.

15 and public records of a governmental entity must be open at all
16 times during office hours to inspection by any person, and may be
17 fully copied or an abstract or memorandum may be prepared from

19 memoranda may be used to supply the general public with copies,
20 abstracts or memoranda of the records or may be used in any other

22 public. This section does not supersede or in any manner affect the
23 federal laws governing copyrights or enlarge, diminish or affect in
24 any other manner the rights of a person in any written book or
25 record which is copyrighted pursuant to federal law.
26 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record
27 which is copyrighted solely because it is copyrighted.
28 3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a
29 public book or record shall not deny a request made pursuant to
30 subsection 1 to inspect or copy or receive a copy of a public book or
31 record on the basis that the requested public book or record contains
32 information that is confidential if the governmental entity can

35 included in the public book or record that is not otherwise
36 confidential.
37 4. If requested, a governmental entity shall provide a copy of a
38 public record in an electronic format by means of an electronic
39 medium. Nothing in this subsection requires a governmental entity
40 to provide a copy of a public record in an electronic format or by
41 means of an electronic medium if:
42 (a) The public record:
43 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
44 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
-

1 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by
2 means of an electronic medium would:
3 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
4 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential
5 and that cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from
6 information that is not otherwise confidential.
7 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who
8 has legal custody or control of a public record:
9 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the
10 medium that is requested because the officer, employee or agent has
11 already prepared or would prefer to provide the copy in a different
12 medium.
13 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon
14 request, prepare the copy of the public record and shall not require
15 the person who has requested the copy to prepare the copy himself
16 or herself.
17 Sec. 54. NRS 239.0115 is hereby amended to read as follows:
18 239.0115 1. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection
19 and subsection 3, notwithstanding any provision of law that has
20 declared a public book or record, or a part thereof, to be
21 confidential, if a public book or record has been in the legal custody
22 or control of one or more governmental entities for at least 30 years,
23 a person may apply to the district court of the county in which the
24 governmental entity that currently has legal custody or control of the
25 public book or record is located for an order directing that
26 governmental entity to allow the person to inspect or copy the public
27 book or record, or a part thereof. If the public book or record
28 pertains to a natural person, a person may not apply for an order
29 pursuant to this subsection until the public book or record has been
30 in the legal custody or control of one or more governmental entities
31 for at least 30 years or until the death of the person to whom the
32 public book or record pertains, whichever is later.
33 2. There is a rebuttable presumption that a person who applies
34 for an order as described in subsection 1 is entitled to inspect or
35 copy the public book or record, or a part thereof, that the person
36 seeks to inspect or copy.
37 3. The provisions of subsection 1 do not apply to any book or
38 record:
