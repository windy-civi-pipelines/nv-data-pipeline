~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to courts; revising provisions relating to deputy
marshals in certain courts; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Based on the constitutional separation of powers, the judiciary has inherent
2 authority to manage and control its employees, including their selection,
3 appointment, promotion, discipline and termination, and if the other branches of
4 government take any legislative or executive actions that directly interfere with the
5 judiciary’s personnel decisions, such interference violates the separation of powers
6 doctrine because it unconstitutionally infringes on the judiciary’s inherent authority
7 to manage and control its employees. (City of Sparks v. Sparks Mun. Court, 129
8 Nev. 348, 362-66 (2013))
9 Under existing law, in each county whose population is 700,000 or more
10 (currently Clark County), the judge of each district court and the justice of the
11 peace of each justice court may appoint a deputy marshal for the court instead of a
12 bailiff, and the deputy marshal serves at the pleasure of the judicial officer making
13 the appointment. (NRS 3.310, 4.353; State ex rel. Vogel v. Grierson, No. 62225,
14 2014 WL 1226461 (Nev. Mar. 21, 2014) (explaining that deputy marshals “are
15 more like employees than public officers because each ‘deputy marshal serves at
16 the pleasure of the judge he or she serves.’ ”)) As a general rule, when a person
17 serves at the pleasure of the appointing authority, the person is considered to be an
18 at-will employee, and the appointing authority has the right to discharge the person
19 for any reason, with or without cause, so long as the reason does not violate public
20 policy. (Nigro v. Nev. State Bd. of Cosmetology, 103 Nev. 496, 497-98 (1987);
21 Wayment v. Holmes, 112 Nev. 232, 235-36 (1996); Dillard Dep’t Stores, Inc. v.
22 Beckwith, 115 Nev. 372, 376 (1999))
23 This bill revises existing law relating to deputy marshals in each county whose
24 population is 700,000 or more (currently Clark County). First, this bill provides that
-
*SB384*

– 2 –
25 the judge of each district court and the justice of the peace of each justice court
26 shall appoint for the court a deputy marshal instead of a bailiff. However, this bill
27 also provides that before such a judicial officer appoints a deputy marshal, the
28 judicial officer must first consider whether there are any qualified and available
29 county employees to serve in the position. Further, this bill provides that after the
30 judicial officer appoints a deputy marshal, regardless of whether the person is a
31 county employee when appointed, the deputy marshal shall be deemed to be a
32 county employee, except that during his or her judicial service: (1) the deputy
33 marshal serves at the pleasure of the judicial officer making the appointment; and
34 (2) the rules and policies that apply to other county employees do not apply to the
35 deputy marshal, unless otherwise provided by the judicial officer.
36 Finally, this bill provides that if the judicial officer ends the service of the
37 deputy marshal in the court of that judicial officer for any reason that does not
38 violate any applicable federal or state law or public policy governing such service,
39 the deputy marshal has no right to serve in that court. However, the deputy marshal
40 remains a county employee and his or her continued employment is subject to the
41 rules and policies that apply to other county employees, including, without
42 limitation, the rules and policies that govern reassignment, transfer, discharge,
43 demotion or discipline.
