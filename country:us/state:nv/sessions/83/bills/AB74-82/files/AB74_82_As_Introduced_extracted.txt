1 Existing law requires the Board of Regents of the University of Nevada to
2 establish policies governing the contracts that faculty members and employees of
3 the Nevada System of Higher Education may enter into or benefit from. (NRS
4 396.255) Existing law also authorizes certain faculty members of the System to bid
5 or enter into a contract with a governmental agency if the contract complies with
6 the policies established by the Board of Regents. (NRS 281.221)
7 Existing law requires that mechanics and workers employed on certain public
8 construction projects be paid at least the wage then prevailing for the type of work
9 that the mechanic or worker performs in the region in which the public work is
10 located. (NRS 338.020) Under existing law, any contract for construction work of
11 the System for which the estimated cost exceeds $100,000 is subject to the
12 prevailing wage requirements. (NRS 338.075)
13 Section 1 of this bill authorizes the Board of Regents to enter into an agreement
14 with a public or private entity, whether for profit or not for profit, to promote and
15 enhance an educational program or student life at an institution within the System.
16 Section 1 requires that such an agreement include certain provisions, including,
17 without limitation, a provision stating that the prevailing wage requirements apply
18 to any construction work performed under the agreement. Section 2 of this bill
19 establishes that any such agreement is subject to the policies established by the

24 finance, design, construct, improve, maintain or operate a transportation facility.

27 maintain, operate or acquire a facility other than a transportation facility. Sections
28 2.1-2.7 of this bill define terms related to such public-private partnerships. Section
