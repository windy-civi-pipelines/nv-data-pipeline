AN ACT relating to unfair trade practices; revising the list of activities that
constitute an unlawful contract, combination or conspiracy in restraint
of trade to include manipulating the price of an essential good or
service in this State; providing a penalty; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 The Nevada Unfair Trade Practice Act sets forth various activities that constitute an
2 unlawful contract, combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade and authorizes the Attorney
3 General to investigate and take certain actions against persons who engage in such activities,
4 which may include, without limitation, criminal prosecution and the imposition of civil
5 penalties. (Chapter 598A of NRS) Existing law makes it a category D felony to engage in
6 such activities. (NRS 598A.280) This bill includes among the activities that constitute an
7 unlawful contract, combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade manipulating the price of an
8 essential good or service in this State. This bill defines “essential good or service” to mean
9 any good or service [: (1) that] which is needed on a daily or recurring basis for the livelihood
10 of a person [, including, without limitation, food, medicine or shelter; and (2) the price for
11 which results in the person paying more than $750 for the good or service over a 30-day
12 period or $9,000 for the good or service over a 1-year period. Under] and which falls within
13 certain specified categories of goods and services. Section 1 of this bill [,] provides that a
14 person manipulates the price of an essential good or service when the person, alone or in
15 concert with others, [intentionally] knowingly engages in any [fraudulent or] deceptive
16 [conduct] trade practice which is intended to and does cause the price of an essential good or
17 service in this State [, as compared to the price of comparable essential goods or services
18 readily available in the 24 months immediately preceding the conduct,] to increase in a
19 manner that : (1) does not reflect the basic forces of supply and demand [.] ; and (2) results
20 in a person paying, over a 1-year period, an amount for the good or service which
21 represents a percentage increase over the amount paid by the person over the
22 immediately preceding year that is equal to or greater than the average percentage
23 increase for the most recent 5-year average annual percentage change for the category of
24 good or service, as set forth in the Personal Consumption Expenditures by State
25 (SAPCE3) for the State of Nevada as published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis of
Assembly Amendment No. 154 to Assembly Bill No. 44 Page 4
26 the United States Department of Commerce. Section 1 sets forth certain exceptions from
27 the prohibition against manipulating the price of an essential good or service.
28 Existing law, with certain exceptions, authorizes a person who is injured or
29 damaged, or threatened with injury or damage, by a violation of the Nevada Unfair
30 Trade Practice Act to bring an action to obtain certain relief. (NRS 598A.210) Sections 1
31 and 2 of this bill provide that the provisions relating to the manipulation of an essential
32 good or service do not establish a private right of action against any person.
