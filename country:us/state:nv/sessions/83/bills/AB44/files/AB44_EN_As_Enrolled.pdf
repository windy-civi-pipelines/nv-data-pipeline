Assembly Bill No. 44–Committee
on Commerce and Labor
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to unfair trade practices; revising the list of
activities that constitute an unlawful contract, combination or
conspiracy in restraint of trade to include manipulating the
price of an essential good or service in this State; providing a
penalty; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
The Nevada Unfair Trade Practice Act sets forth various activities that
constitute an unlawful contract, combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade and
authorizes the Attorney General to investigate and take certain actions against
persons who engage in such activities, which may include, without limitation,
criminal prosecution and the imposition of civil penalties. (Chapter 598A of NRS)
Existing law makes it a category D felony to engage in such activities. (NRS
598A.280) This bill includes among the activities that constitute an unlawful
contract, combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade manipulating the price of
an essential good or service in this State. This bill defines “essential good or
service” to mean any good or service which is needed on a daily or recurring basis
for the livelihood of a person and which falls within certain specified categories of
goods and services. Section 1 of this bill provides that a person manipulates the
price of an essential good or service when the person, alone or in concert with
others, knowingly engages in any deceptive trade practice which: (1) involves
conduct engaged in by the person either with the intent to mislead consumers or for
the purpose of manipulating the market for an essential good or service; and (2) is
intended to and does cause the price of an essential good or service in this State to
increase in a manner that does not reflect the basic forces of supply and demand
and results in a person paying, over a 1-year period, an amount for the good or
service which represents a percentage increase over the amount paid by the person
over the immediately preceding year that is equal to or greater than the average
percentage increase for the most recent 5-year average annual percentage change
for the category of good or service, as set forth in the Personal Consumption
Expenditures by State (SAPCE3) for the State of Nevada as published by the
Bureau of Economic Analysis of the United States Department of Commerce.
Section 1 sets forth certain exceptions from the prohibition against manipulating
the price of an essential good or service.
Existing law, with certain exceptions, authorizes a person who is injured or
damaged, or threatened with injury or damage, by a violation of the Nevada Unfair
Trade Practice Act to bring an action to obtain certain relief. (NRS 598A.210)
Sections 1 and 2 of this bill provide that the provisions relating to the manipulation
of an essential good or service do not establish a private right of action against any
person.
