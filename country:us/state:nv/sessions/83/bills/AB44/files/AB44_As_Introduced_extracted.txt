AN ACT relating to unfair trade practices; revising the list of
activities that constitute an unlawful contract,
combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade to include
manipulating the price of an essential good or service in
this State; providing a penalty; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 The Nevada Unfair Trade Practice Act sets forth various activities that
2 constitute an unlawful contract, combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade and
3 authorizes the Attorney General to investigate and take certain actions against
4 persons who engage in such activities, which may include, without limitation,
5 criminal prosecution and the imposition of civil penalties. (Chapter 598A of NRS)
6 Existing law makes it a category D felony to engage in such activities. (NRS
7 598A.280) This bill includes among the activities that constitute an unlawful
8 contract, combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade manipulating the price of
9 an essential good or service in this State. This bill defines “essential good or
10 service” to mean any good or service: (1) that is needed on a daily or recurring
11 basis for the livelihood of a person, including, without limitation, food, medicine or
12 shelter; and (2) the price for which results in the person paying more than $750 for
13 the good or service over a 30-day period or $9,000 for the good or service over a 1-
14 year period. Under this bill, a person manipulates the price of an essential good or
15 service when the person, alone or in concert with others, intentionally engages in
16 any fraudulent or deceptive conduct which is intended to and does cause the price
17 of an essential good or service in this State, as compared to the price of comparable
18 essential goods or services readily available in the 24 months immediately
