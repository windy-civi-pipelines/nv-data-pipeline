AN ACT relating to unfair trade practices; revising the list of
activities that constitute an unlawful contract,
combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade to include
manipulating the price of an essential good or service in
this State; providing a penalty; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 The Nevada Unfair Trade Practice Act sets forth various activities that
2 constitute an unlawful contract, combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade and
3 authorizes the Attorney General to investigate and take certain actions against
4 persons who engage in such activities, which may include, without limitation,
5 criminal prosecution and the imposition of civil penalties. (Chapter 598A of NRS)
6 Existing law makes it a category D felony to engage in such activities. (NRS
7 598A.280) This bill includes among the activities that constitute an unlawful
8 contract, combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade manipulating the price of
9 an essential good or service in this State. This bill defines “essential good or
10 service” to mean any good or service which is needed on a daily or recurring basis
11 for the livelihood of a person and which falls within certain specified categories of
12 goods and services. Section 1 of this bill provides that a person manipulates the
13 price of an essential good or service when the person, alone or in concert with
14 others, knowingly engages in any deceptive trade practice which: (1) involves
15 conduct engaged in by the person either with the intent to mislead consumers or for
16 the purpose of manipulating the market for an essential good or service; and (2) is
17 intended to and does cause the price of an essential good or service in this State to
18 increase in a manner that does not reflect the basic forces of supply and demand
19 and results in a person paying, over a 1-year period, an amount for the good or

20 service which represents a percentage increase over the amount paid by the person
21 over the immediately preceding year that is equal to or greater than the average
22 percentage increase for the most recent 5-year average annual percentage change
23 for the category of good or service, as set forth in the Personal Consumption
24 Expenditures by State (SAPCE3) for the State of Nevada as published by the
25 Bureau of Economic Analysis of the United States Department of Commerce.
26 Section 1 sets forth certain exceptions from the prohibition against manipulating
27 the price of an essential good or service.
28 Existing law, with certain exceptions, authorizes a person who is injured or
29 damaged, or threatened with injury or damage, by a violation of the Nevada Unfair
30 Trade Practice Act to bring an action to obtain certain relief. (NRS 598A.210)
31 Sections 1 and 2 of this bill provide that the provisions relating to the manipulation
32 of an essential good or service do not establish a private right of action against any
33 person.
