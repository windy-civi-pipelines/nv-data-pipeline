AN ACT relating to unfair trade practices; revising the list of
activities that constitute an unlawful contract,
combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade to include
manipulating the price of an essential good or service in
this State; providing a penalty; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 The Nevada Unfair Trade Practice Act sets forth various activities that
2 constitute an unlawful contract, combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade and
3 authorizes the Attorney General to investigate and take certain actions against
4 persons who engage in such activities, which may include, without limitation,
5 criminal prosecution and the imposition of civil penalties. (Chapter 598A of NRS)
6 Existing law makes it a category D felony to engage in such activities. (NRS
7 598A.280) This bill includes among the activities that constitute an unlawful
8 contract, combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade manipulating the price of
9 an essential good or service in this State. This bill defines “essential good or
10 service” to mean any good or service which is needed on a daily or recurring basis
11 for the livelihood of a person and which falls within certain specified categories of
12 goods and services. Section 1 of this bill provides that a person manipulates the
13 price of an essential good or service when the person, alone or in concert with
14 others, knowingly engages in any deceptive trade practice which is intended to and
15 does cause the price of an essential good or service in this State to increase in a
16 manner that: (1) does not reflect the basic forces of supply and demand; and (2)
17 results in a person paying, over a 1-year period, an amount for the good or service
18 which represents a percentage increase over the amount paid by the person over the
19 immediately preceding year that is equal to or greater than the average percentage

21 category of good or service, as set forth in the Personal Consumption Expenditures
22 by State (SAPCE3) for the State of Nevada as published by the Bureau of
23 Economic Analysis of the United States Department of Commerce. Section 1 sets
24 forth certain exceptions from the prohibition against manipulating the price of an
25 essential good or service.
26 Existing law, with certain exceptions, authorizes a person who is injured or
27 damaged, or threatened with injury or damage, by a violation of the Nevada Unfair
28 Trade Practice Act to bring an action to obtain certain relief. (NRS 598A.210)
29 Sections 1 and 2 of this bill provide that the provisions relating to the manipulation
30 of an essential good or service do not establish a private right of action against any
31 person.
