12 authority to prohibit the owner or operator of a municipal solid waste landfill from
13 accepting a propulsion battery for disposal.
14 Section 26 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law relating to the
15 collection and disposal of solid waste to section 2.
16 Section 27 of this bill provides that the prohibition and civil penalty set forth in
17 section 2 is an exception to other penalties in existing law relating to the disposal or
18 incineration of motor vehicle batteries.
19 Sections 28-31 of this bill apply certain penalties, remedies and enforcement
20 mechanisms relating to the collection and disposal of solid waste to the provisions
21 of section 2.
22 Existing law provides that: (1) a plan for a solid waste management system
23 does not apply to a vehicle owned by an automobile wrecker or in the possession of
24 a salvage pool; and (2) the provisions governing the collection and disposal of solid
25 waste do not prevent a mining operation from dumping waste from its operation on
26 its own lands. (NRS 444.620) Section 32 of this bill applies these exceptions to
27 section 2.
28 Sections 4-15 of this bill define certain terms relating to the disposal of
29 propulsion batteries. Section 3 of this bill applies those definitions to the provisions
30 of sections 4-25 of this bill.
31 Section 16 sets forth a declaration of the Legislature relating to the
32 management and disposal of propulsion batteries in this State. Section 17 sets forth
33 the applicability of the provisions of sections 3-25.
34 Section 18 requires a battery provider who sells, offers for sale or distributes
35 for sale a propulsion battery or a vehicle containing a propulsion battery in or into
36 this State to: (1) add a label to the propulsion battery with the name and contact
37 information of the battery provider; and (2) ensure that the battery health of the
38 propulsion battery is easily interpretable and accessible.
39 Section 19 requires a battery provider or, if a propulsion battery has been
40 reused, repaired, repurposed or remanufactured by a secondary handler or
41 secondary user, the secondary handler or secondary user, to dispose of all spent
42 propulsion batteries in this State with a specialized battery recycler.
43 Section 20 sets forth the methods by which a person other than a battery
44 provider, secondary handler or secondary user may dispose of a propulsion battery
45 or a vehicle containing a propulsion battery, which include: (1) returning the
46 propulsion battery to the party responsible for disposal; (2) notifying the
47 responsible party to collect the propulsion battery; or (3) selling or transferring
48 the propulsion battery or vehicle to a secondary handler, secondary user or
49 specialized battery recycler. Section 21 similarly sets forth the methods by which a
50 secondary handler or secondary user may dispose of a propulsion battery or a
51 vehicle containing a propulsion battery. Section 22 requires a battery provider,
52 secondary handler or secondary user to take certain actions upon receiving such
53 notification and when collecting a propulsion battery.
54 Sections 23-25 require each battery provider, secondary handler, secondary
55 user and specialized battery recycler in this State to submit certain reports to the
56 Division of Environmental Protection of the State Department of Conservation and
57 Natural Resources.
