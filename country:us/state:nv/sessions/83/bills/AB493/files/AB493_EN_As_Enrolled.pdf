which a customer is purchasing the output to file with the Division a plan for the
disposal of the distributed generation system at the end of the useful life of the
system. Section 37 of this bill requires an agreement for the lease of a distributed
generation system to include a description of any obligation the lessor has
regarding the disposition of the distributed generation system in accordance with
the plan.
Existing law requires certain electric utilities to file a surplus asset retirement
plan with the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada for each asset classified as
surplus and sets forth certain requirements for the plan. (NRS 704.734) Section 38
of this bill requires a surplus asset retirement plan for certain utility-scale solar
projects to include certain information relating to the decommissioning of a site of
such a project and the restoration of the land.
Section 36.5 of this bill requires each facility that recycles a distributed
generation system or utility-scale solar project or a component thereof to submit a
