ON GROWTH AND INFRASTRUCTURE)
MARCH 24, 2025
_______________
Referred to Committee on Growth and Infrastructure
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to the collection, disposal and retirement
of certain types of waste. (BDR 40-424)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to waste; [establishing provisions relating to the disposal of
propulsion batteries;] requiring [an owner] certain owners of a
distributed generation system to file certain plans relating to the
disposal of the distributed generation system with the Division of
Environmental Protection of the State Department of Conservation and
Natural Resources; requiring facilities that recycle materials from a
distributed generation system or utility-scale solar project to file a
report with the Division; requiring a surplus retirement plan to
include certain information relating to the retirement of a utility-scale
solar project; [providing penalties;] and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 [Existing law prohibits: (1) the willful disposal, abandonment or dumping of a motor
2 vehicle battery at any site which has not been issued a permit by the solid waste management
3 authority and at any sanitary landfill or other disposal site established by a municipality which
4 has not been issued a permit by the solid waste management authority; and (2) the incineration
5 of a motor vehicle battery as a means of disposal, unless approved by the solid waste
6 management authority. (NRS 444.583) Existing law further requires a solid waste
7 management authority to issue permits for the operation of disposal sites for solid waste.
8 (NRS 444.553) Section 2 of this bill: (1) requires all propulsion batteries in this State to be
9 disposed of with a specialized battery recycler; (2) prohibits the disposal of propulsion
10 batteries in municipal solid waste landfills; and (3) requires each solid waste management
11 authority to prohibit the owner or operator of a municipal solid waste landfill from accepting a
12 propulsion battery for disposal.
13 Section 26 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law relating to the collection and
14 disposal of solid waste to section 2.

Assembly Amendment No. 413 to Assembly Bill No. 493 Page 4
15 Section 27 of this bill provides that the prohibition and civil penalty set forth in section 2
16 is an exception to other penalties in existing law relating to the disposal or incineration of
