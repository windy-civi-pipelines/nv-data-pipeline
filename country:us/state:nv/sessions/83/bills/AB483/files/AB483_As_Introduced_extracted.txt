26 2. The health authority, pursuant to regulations and procedures
27 adopted by the board, shall make a determination of the applicant’s
28 qualifications to be certified as an emergency medical technician,
29 advanced emergency medical technician or paramedic and shall
30 issue the appropriate certificate to each qualified applicant.

32 may be renewed if the holder of the certificate complies with the
33 provisions of this chapter and meets the qualifications set forth in
34 the regulations and standards established by the board pursuant to
35 this chapter. The regulations and standards established by the board
36 must provide for the completion of:

39 terrorism that involves the use of a weapon of mass destruction. The

17 4. The health authority may suspend or revoke a certificate if it
18 finds that the holder of the certificate no longer meets the prescribed
19 qualifications. Unless the certificate is suspended by the district

21 appeal the suspension or revocation of his or her certificate pursuant
22 to regulations adopted by the board.
