6 for the regulation of the licensure of: (1) naprapaths, music therapists, dieticians,
7 medical laboratory personnel and persons who are engaged in radiation therapy and

30 qualifications to be certified as an emergency medical technician,
31 advanced emergency medical technician or paramedic and shall
32 issue the appropriate certificate to each qualified applicant.
33 3. A certificate is valid for a period not exceeding 2 years and
34 may be renewed if the holder of the certificate complies with the
