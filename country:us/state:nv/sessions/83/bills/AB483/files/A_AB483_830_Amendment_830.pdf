EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; requiring certain agencies and licensing boards to
establish a process for the priority review of certain applications for
licensure to practice [a] certain health [profession;] professions; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the regulation of the licensure and certification of emergency
2 medical services personnel, including ambulance attendants and firefighters, by: (1) in a
3 county whose population is 700,000 or more (currently Clark County), the district board of
4 health; and (2) in all other counties, the State Board of Health. (NRS 450B.060, 450B.160,
5 450B.180) Existing law also provides for the regulation of the licensure of: (1) naprapaths,
6 music therapists, dieticians, medical laboratory personnel and persons who are engaged in
7 radiation therapy and radiologic imaging by the State Board; and (2) various other health
8 professions by professional licensing boards that are specific to those professions. (chapters
9 630-637B, 640-640B, 640D-641D, 652 and 653 of NRS) Sections 3-5 of this bill require
10 [each agency or licensing board that regulates the licensure or certification of providers of
11 health care] a district board of health in a county whose population is 700,000 or more
12 (currently only Clark County), the State Board and professional licensing boards that
13 regulate medical, dental or nursing professions to establish a process for prioritizing the
14 review of an application for initial licensure if the applicant demonstrates that he or she will
15 provide health care primarily in a historically underserved community. Section 1 of this bill
16 defines the term “historically underserved community” for the purpose of provisions relating
17 to emergency medical services, and section 2 of this bill establishes the applicability of that
18 definition.
