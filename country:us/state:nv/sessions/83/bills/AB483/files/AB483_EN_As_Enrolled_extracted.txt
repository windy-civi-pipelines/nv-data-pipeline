Section 1:
Health and Human Services
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to health care; requiring certain agencies and
licensing boards to establish a process for the priority review
of certain applications for licensure to practice certain health
professions; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law provides for the regulation of the licensure and certification of
emergency medical services personnel, including ambulance attendants and
firefighters, by: (1) in a county whose population is 700,000 or more (currently
Clark County), the district board of health; and (2) in all other counties, the State
Board of Health. (NRS 450B.060, 450B.160, 450B.180) Existing law also provides
for the regulation of the licensure of: (1) naprapaths, music therapists, dieticians,
medical laboratory personnel and persons who are engaged in radiation therapy and
radiologic imaging by the State Board; and (2) various other health professions by
professional licensing boards that are specific to those professions. (chapters 630-
637B, 640-640B, 640D-641D, 652 and 653 of NRS) Sections 3-5 of this bill
require a district board of health in a county whose population is 700,000 or more
(currently only Clark County), the State Board and professional licensing boards
that regulate medical, dental or nursing professions to establish a process for
prioritizing the review of an application for initial licensure if the applicant
demonstrates that he or she will provide health care primarily in a historically
underserved community. Section 1 of this bill defines the term “historically
underserved community” for the purpose of provisions relating to emergency
medical services, and section 2 of this bill establishes the applicability of that
definition.
