AN ACT relating to water; revising provisions relating to the
establishment, membership and duties of a groundwater
board; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes a board of county commissioners to recommend to the
2 State Engineer that the State Engineer establish a groundwater board in an area
3 designated as a groundwater basin by the State Engineer. If the State Engineer
4 directs the establishment of a groundwater board, the Governor is required to
5 appoint seven members to serve on the groundwater board. Existing law authorizes
6 the Governor to dissolve the groundwater board if the Governor determines that the
7 future activities of the board are likely to be insubstantial. (NRS 534.035) Section 1
8 of this bill authorizes a board of county commissioners to request or boards of
9 county commissioners to jointly request that the State Engineer establish a
10 groundwater board. If the State Engineer establishes a groundwater board, section
11 1: (1) requires the State Engineer to appoint seven members to the groundwater
12 board; and (2) authorizes a board of county commissioners or boards of county
13 commissioners, as applicable, to appoint a nonvoting member to the groundwater
14 board. Section 1 additionally provides that the groundwater board: (1) must be
15 dissolved after 4 years, unless the State Engineer approves a request from the board
16 of county commissioners or boards of county commissioners, as applicable, to
17 continue the board; and (2) may be dissolved by a majority vote of the groundwater
18 board. Section 1 further provides that only one groundwater board may be
19 established for a designated groundwater basin.
20 Section 1 also requires the State Engineer to consider the written advice and
21 recommendations of the groundwater board on reducing overpumping in the
22 designated groundwater basin.

– 2 –
23 Section 1 also authorizes the board of county commissioners or boards of
24 county commissioners, as applicable, to submit a list of names of persons who are
25 eligible for appointment to the groundwater board to the State Engineer, who may
26 appoint members to the groundwater board from the list.
27 Existing law requires: (1) the State to pay certain expenses of a groundwater
28 board such as per diem and travel allowances for board members and expenses for
29 consultants employed by a groundwater board; and (2) the State Engineer to
30 determine and certify the budget of a groundwater board for paying such expenses.
31 (NRS 534.035, 534.040) Sections 1 and 2 of this bill eliminate these provisions
32 and provide that members serve without compensation.

43 Sec. 2. NRS 534.040 is hereby amended to read as follows:
44 534.040 1. Upon the initiation of the administration of this
45 chapter in any particular basin, and where the investigations of the
-
*AB363_R1*

– 5 –
1 State Engineer have shown the necessity for the supervision over the
2 waters of that basin, the State Engineer may employ a well
3 supervisor and other necessary assistants, who shall execute the
4 duties as provided in this chapter under the direction of the State
5 Engineer. The salaries of the well supervisor and the assistants of
6 the well supervisor must be fixed by the State Engineer. The well
7 supervisor and assistants are exempt from the provisions of chapter
8 284 of NRS.
9 2. If the money available from the license fees provided for in
10 NRS 534.140 is not sufficient to pay those salaries, together with
11 necessary expenses, including the compensation and other expenses
12 of the Well Drillers’ Advisory Board, the board of county
13 commissioners shall, except as otherwise provided in this
14 subsection, levy a special assessment annually, or at such time as the
15 assessment is needed, upon all taxable property situated within the
16 confines of the area designated by the State Engineer to come under
17 the provisions of this chapter in an amount as is necessary to pay
18 such salaries and expenses. If the board of county commissioners
19 determines that the amount of a special assessment levied upon a
20 property owner pursuant to this section when combined with the
21 amount of all other taxes and assessments levied upon the property
22 owner is less than the cost of collecting the special assessment
23 levied pursuant to this subsection, the board of county
24 commissioners may exempt the property owner from the assessment
25 and appropriate money from the general fund of the county to pay
26 the cost of the assessment.
27 3. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2, in designated
28 areas within which the use of groundwater is predominantly for
29 agricultural purposes, any special assessment levied pursuant to this
30 section must be charged against each water user who has a permit to
31 appropriate water or a perfected water right, and the charge against
32 each water user must be based upon the proportion which his or her
33 water right bears to the aggregate water rights in the designated
34 area. The minimum charge is $1.
35 4. The salaries and expenses may be paid by the State Engineer
36 from the Water Distribution Revolving Account pending the levy
37 and collection of an assessment levied pursuant to this section.
38 5. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2, if a special
39 assessment is levied pursuant to this section, the proper officers of
40 the county shall levy and collect the special assessment as other
41 special assessments are levied and collected, and the assessment is a
42 lien upon the property.
43 6. Any special assessment collected pursuant to this section
44 must be deposited with the State Treasurer for credit to the Water
45 District Account to be accounted for in basin well accounts.

1 7. [Upon determination and certification by the State Engineer
2 of the amount to be budgeted for the current or ensuing fiscal year
3 for the purpose of paying the per diem and travel allowances of the
4 groundwater board and employing consultants or other help needed
5 to fulfill its responsibilities, the State Controller shall transfer that
6 amount to a separate operating account for that fiscal year for the
7 groundwater basin. Claims against the account must be approved by
8 the groundwater board and paid as other claims against the State are
9 paid.] The State Engineer may use money in a particular basin well
10 account to support an activity outside the basin in which the money
11 is collected if the activity bears a direct relationship to the
12 responsibilities or activities of the State Engineer regarding the
13 particular groundwater basin.
14 Sec. 3. This act becomes effective on July 1, 2025.
