SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to groundwater boards. (BDR 48-385)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to water; revising provisions relating to the establishment,
membership and duties of a groundwater board; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes a board of county commissioners to recommend to the State
2 Engineer that the State Engineer establish a groundwater board in an area designated as a
3 groundwater basin by the State Engineer. If the State Engineer directs the establishment of a
4 groundwater board, the Governor is required to appoint seven members to serve on the
5 groundwater board. Existing law authorizes the Governor to dissolve the groundwater board if
6 the Governor determines that the future activities of the board are likely to be insubstantial.
7 (NRS 534.035) Section 1 of this bill authorizes a board of county commissioners to request or
8 boards of county commissioners to jointly request that the State Engineer establish a
9 groundwater board. If [requested,] the State Engineer establishes a groundwater board,
10 section 1: (1) requires the State Engineer to appoint seven members to the groundwater board;
11 and (2) authorizes a board of county commissioners or boards of county commissioners, as
12 applicable, to appoint a nonvoting member to the groundwater board. Section 1 additionally
13 provides that the groundwater board: (1) must be dissolved after 4 years, unless the State
14 Engineer approves a request from the board of county commissioners or boards of county
15 commissioners, as applicable, to continue the board; and (2) may be dissolved by a majority
16 vote of the groundwater board. Section 1 further provides that only one groundwater board
17 may be established for a designated groundwater basin.
18 Section 1 also requires the State Engineer to consider the written advice and
19 recommendations of the groundwater board on reducing overpumping in the designated
20 groundwater basin.
21 Section 1 also authorizes the board of county commissioners or boards of county
22 commissioners, as applicable, to submit a list of names of persons who are eligible for
23 appointment to the groundwater board to the State Engineer, who may appoint
24 members to the groundwater board from the list.
25 Existing law requires: (1) the State to pay certain expenses of a groundwater board such
26 as per diem and travel allowances for board members and expenses for consultants employed
27 by a groundwater board; and (2) the State Engineer to determine and certify the budget of a
28 groundwater board for paying such expenses. (NRS 534.035, 534.040) Sections 1 and 2 of
29 this bill eliminate these provisions and provide that members serve without compensation.

Assembly Amendment No. 259 to Assembly Bill No. 363 Page 6
1 Sec. 2. NRS 534.040 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 534.040 1. Upon the initiation of the administration of this chapter in any
3 particular basin, and where the investigations of the State Engineer have shown the
4 necessity for the supervision over the waters of that basin, the State Engineer may
5 employ a well supervisor and other necessary assistants, who shall execute the
6 duties as provided in this chapter under the direction of the State Engineer. The
7 salaries of the well supervisor and the assistants of the well supervisor must be
8 fixed by the State Engineer. The well supervisor and assistants are exempt from the
9 provisions of chapter 284 of NRS.
10 2. If the money available from the license fees provided for in NRS 534.140
11 is not sufficient to pay those salaries, together with necessary expenses, including
12 the compensation and other expenses of the Well Drillers’ Advisory Board, the
13 board of county commissioners shall, except as otherwise provided in this
14 subsection, levy a special assessment annually, or at such time as the assessment is
15 needed, upon all taxable property situated within the confines of the area designated
16 by the State Engineer to come under the provisions of this chapter in an amount as
17 is necessary to pay such salaries and expenses. If the board of county
18 commissioners determines that the amount of a special assessment levied upon a
19 property owner pursuant to this section when combined with the amount of all other
20 taxes and assessments levied upon the property owner is less than the cost of
21 collecting the special assessment levied pursuant to this subsection, the board of
22 county commissioners may exempt the property owner from the assessment and
23 appropriate money from the general fund of the county to pay the cost of the
24 assessment.
25 3. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2, in designated areas within
26 which the use of groundwater is predominantly for agricultural purposes, any
27 special assessment levied pursuant to this section must be charged against each
28 water user who has a permit to appropriate water or a perfected water right, and the
29 charge against each water user must be based upon the proportion which his or her
30 water right bears to the aggregate water rights in the designated area. The minimum
31 charge is $1.
32 4. The salaries and expenses may be paid by the State Engineer from the
33 Water Distribution Revolving Account pending the levy and collection of an
34 assessment levied pursuant to this section.
35 5. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2, if a special assessment is
36 levied pursuant to this section, the proper officers of the county shall levy and
37 collect the special assessment as other special assessments are levied and collected,
38 and the assessment is a lien upon the property.
39 6. Any special assessment collected pursuant to this section must be deposited
40 with the State Treasurer for credit to the Water District Account to be accounted for
41 in basin well accounts.
42 7. [Upon determination and certification by the State Engineer of the amount
43 to be budgeted for the current or ensuing fiscal year for the purpose of paying the
44 per diem and travel allowances of the groundwater board and employing
45 consultants or other help needed to fulfill its responsibilities, the State Controller
46 shall transfer that amount to a separate operating account for that fiscal year for the
47 groundwater basin. Claims against the account must be approved by the
48 groundwater board and paid as other claims against the State are paid.] The State
49 Engineer may use money in a particular basin well account to support an activity
50 outside the basin in which the money is collected if the activity bears a direct
51 relationship to the responsibilities or activities of the State Engineer regarding the
52 particular groundwater basin.
53 Sec. 3. This act becomes effective on July 1, 2025.

17 is necessary to pay such salaries and expenses. If the board of county
18 commissioners determines that the amount of a special assessment levied upon a
19 property owner pursuant to this section when combined with the amount of all other
20 taxes and assessments levied upon the property owner is less than the cost of
21 collecting the special assessment levied pursuant to this subsection, the board of
22 county commissioners may exempt the property owner from the assessment and
23 appropriate money from the general fund of the county to pay the cost of the
24 assessment.
25 3. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2, in designated areas within
26 which the use of groundwater is predominantly for agricultural purposes, any
27 special assessment levied pursuant to this section must be charged against each
28 water user who has a permit to appropriate water or a perfected water right, and the
29 charge against each water user must be based upon the proportion which his or her
30 water right bears to the aggregate water rights in the designated area. The minimum
31 charge is $1.
32 4. The salaries and expenses may be paid by the State Engineer from the
33 Water Distribution Revolving Account pending the levy and collection of an
34 assessment levied pursuant to this section.
35 5. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2, if a special assessment is
36 levied pursuant to this section, the proper officers of the county shall levy and
37 collect the special assessment as other special assessments are levied and collected,
38 and the assessment is a lien upon the property.
39 6. Any special assessment collected pursuant to this section must be deposited
40 with the State Treasurer for credit to the Water District Account to be accounted for
41 in basin well accounts.
42 7. [Upon determination and certification by the State Engineer of the amount
43 to be budgeted for the current or ensuing fiscal year for the purpose of paying the
44 per diem and travel allowances of the groundwater board and employing
45 consultants or other help needed to fulfill its responsibilities, the State Controller
46 shall transfer that amount to a separate operating account for that fiscal year for the
47 groundwater basin. Claims against the account must be approved by the
48 groundwater board and paid as other claims against the State are paid.] The State
49 Engineer may use money in a particular basin well account to support an activity
50 outside the basin in which the money is collected if the activity bears a direct
51 relationship to the responsibilities or activities of the State Engineer regarding the
52 particular groundwater basin.
53 Sec. 3. This act becomes effective on July 1, 2025.
