AN ACT relating to water; revising provisions relating to the
establishment, membership and duties of a groundwater

thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes a board of county commissioners to recommend to the
2 State Engineer that the State Engineer establish a groundwater board in an area
3 designated as a groundwater basin by the State Engineer. If the State Engineer
4 directs the establishment of a groundwater board, the Governor is required to
5 appoint seven members to serve on the groundwater board. Existing law authorizes
6 the Governor to dissolve the groundwater board if the Governor determines that the
7 future activities of the board are likely to be insubstantial. (NRS 534.035) Section 1
8 of this bill authorizes a board of county commissioners to request or boards of
9 county commissioners to jointly request that the State Engineer establish a
10 groundwater board. If requested, section 1: (1) requires the State Engineer to
11 appoint seven members to the groundwater board; and (2) authorizes a board of
12 county commissioners or boards of county commissioners, as applicable, to appoint
13 a nonvoting member to the groundwater board. Section 1 additionally provides that
14 the groundwater board: (1) must be dissolved after 4 years, unless the State
15 Engineer approves a request from the board of county commissioners or boards of
16 county commissioners, as applicable, to continue the board; and (2) may be
17 dissolved by a majority vote of the groundwater board. Section 1 further provides
18 that only one groundwater board may be established for a designated groundwater
19 basin.
20 Section 1 also requires the State Engineer to consider the written advice and
21 recommendations of the groundwater board on reducing overpumping in the
22 designated groundwater basin.

24 board such as per diem and travel allowances for board members and expenses for
25 consultants employed by a groundwater board; and (2) the State Engineer to

34 assessment is levied pursuant to this section, the proper officers of
35 the county shall levy and collect the special assessment as other
36 special assessments are levied and collected, and the assessment is a
37 lien upon the property.

40 District Account to be accounted for in basin well accounts.

43 for the purpose of paying the per diem and travel allowances of the
44 groundwater board and employing consultants or other help needed
45 to fulfill its responsibilities, the State Controller shall transfer that
-
