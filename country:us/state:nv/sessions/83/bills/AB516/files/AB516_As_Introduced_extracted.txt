14 participating in and billing Medicaid. Section 4 of this bill makes a conforming
15 change to require the Director to administer the provisions of sections 2 and 3 in
16 the same manner as the provisions of existing law governing Medicaid. Section 5
17 of this bill makes appropriations to the Division to cover certain costs of operating
18 the Center.

23 Department of Education. Section 6 also requires the Director to apply for any
