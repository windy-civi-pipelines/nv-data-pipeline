Section 1:
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to insurance; revising provisions governing
certain duties of insurers and certain other providers of health
coverage with regard to coverage and claims for persons who
are eligible for or provided medical assistance under
Medicaid; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Under existing law, if a state agency is assigned any rights of a person who is
eligible for medical assistance under Medicaid, insurers and certain other providers
of health coverage are subject to certain requirements. Among other requirements,
existing law requires the insurer or other provider to: (1) respond to any inquiry by
the state agency regarding a claim for payment for the provision of any medical
item or service not later than 3 years after the date of the provision of the medical
item or service; and (2) agree not to deny a claim submitted by the state agency for
certain reasons. (NRS 689A.430, 689B.300, 695A.151, 695B.340, 695C.163,
695F.440)

Section 2:
Section 202 of the federal Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Pub. L. No.
117-103, revised certain requirements for a state plan for medical assistance
concerning the liability of third parties for payment of a claim for a health care item
or service. (42 U.S.C. § 1396a) Sections 1-6 of this bill revise existing law to
comply with those requirements. Sections 1-6 require insurers and certain other
providers of health coverage that the state agency reasonably believes cover the
person who is eligible for medical assistance under Medicaid to respond to an
inquiry regarding a claim for payment for the provision of any medical item or
service not later than 60 days after receiving the inquiry. Sections 1-6 also require
insurers and certain other providers of health coverage to agree not to deny a claim
submitted by the state agency solely on the basis of lack of prior authorization if the
state agency authorized the medical item or service.

Raw Text:
Senate Bill No. 9–Committee on Commerce and Labor
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to insurance; revising provisions governing
certain duties of insurers and certain other providers of health
coverage with regard to coverage and claims for persons who
are eligible for or provided medical assistance under
Medicaid; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Under existing law, if a state agency is assigned any rights of a person who is
eligible for medical assistance under Medicaid, insurers and certain other providers
of health coverage are subject to certain requirements. Among other requirements,
existing law requires the insurer or other provider to: (1) respond to any inquiry by
the state agency regarding a claim for payment for the provision of any medical
item or service not later than 3 years after the date of the provision of the medical
item or service; and (2) agree not to deny a claim submitted by the state agency for
certain reasons. (NRS 689A.430, 689B.300, 695A.151, 695B.340, 695C.163,
695F.440)
Section 202 of the federal Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Pub. L. No.
117-103, revised certain requirements for a state plan for medical assistance
concerning the liability of third parties for payment of a claim for a health care item
or service. (42 U.S.C. § 1396a) Sections 1-6 of this bill revise existing law to
comply with those requirements. Sections 1-6 require insurers and certain other
providers of health coverage that the state agency reasonably believes cover the
person who is eligible for medical assistance under Medicaid to respond to an
inquiry regarding a claim for payment for the provision of any medical item or
service not later than 60 days after receiving the inquiry. Sections 1-6 also require
insurers and certain other providers of health coverage to agree not to deny a claim
submitted by the state agency solely on the basis of lack of prior authorization if the
state agency authorized the medical item or service.
