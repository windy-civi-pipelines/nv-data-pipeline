AN ACT relating to insurance; revising provisions governing
certain duties of insurers and certain other providers of
health coverage with regard to coverage and claims for
persons who are eligible for or provided medical
assistance under Medicaid; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, if a state agency is assigned any rights of a person who is
2 eligible for medical assistance under Medicaid, insurers and certain other providers
3 of health coverage are subject to certain requirements. Among other requirements,
4 existing law requires the insurer or other provider to: (1) respond to any inquiry by
5 the state agency regarding a claim for payment for the provision of any medical
6 item or service not later than 3 years after the date of the provision of the medical
7 item or service; and (2) agree not to deny a claim submitted by the state agency for
8 certain reasons. (NRS 689A.430, 689B.300, 695A.151, 695B.340, 695C.163,
9 695F.440)
10 Section 202 of the federal Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Pub. L. No.
11 117-103, revised certain requirements for a state plan for medical assistance
12 concerning the liability of third parties for payment of a claim for a health care item
13 or service. (42 U.S.C. § 1396a) Sections 1-6 of this bill revise existing law to
14 comply with those requirements. Sections 1-6 require insurers and certain other
15 providers of health coverage that the state agency reasonably believes cover the
16 person who is eligible for medical assistance under Medicaid to respond to an
17 inquiry regarding a claim for payment for the provision of any medical item or
18 service not later than 60 days after receiving the inquiry. Sections 1-6 also require

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to insurance; revising provisions governing
certain duties of insurers and certain other providers of
health coverage with regard to coverage and claims for
persons who are eligible for or provided medical
assistance under Medicaid; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, if a state agency is assigned any rights of a person who is
2 eligible for medical assistance under Medicaid, insurers and certain other providers
3 of health coverage are subject to certain requirements. Among other requirements,
4 existing law requires the insurer or other provider to: (1) respond to any inquiry by
5 the state agency regarding a claim for payment for the provision of any medical
6 item or service not later than 3 years after the date of the provision of the medical
7 item or service; and (2) agree not to deny a claim submitted by the state agency for
8 certain reasons. (NRS 689A.430, 689B.300, 695A.151, 695B.340, 695C.163,
9 695F.440)
10 Section 202 of the federal Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Pub. L. No.
11 117-103, revised certain requirements for a state plan for medical assistance
12 concerning the liability of third parties for payment of a claim for a health care item
13 or service. (42 U.S.C. § 1396a) Sections 1-6 of this bill revise existing law to
14 comply with those requirements. Sections 1-6 require insurers and certain other
15 providers of health coverage that the state agency reasonably believes cover the
16 person who is eligible for medical assistance under Medicaid to respond to an
17 inquiry regarding a claim for payment for the provision of any medical item or
18 service not later than 60 days after receiving the inquiry. Sections 1-6 also require
