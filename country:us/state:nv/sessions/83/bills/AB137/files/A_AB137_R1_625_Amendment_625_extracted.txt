AN ACT relating to liens; revising certain requirements for the advertising of a sale
of personal property to satisfy the lien of an owner of a facility for
storage; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides, in general, that if the occupant of a storage space at a facility for
2 storage defaults on the payment of rent or other charges that are due to the owner of the
3 facility pursuant to a rental agreement, the owner has a lien on the personal property of the
4 occupant contained in the storage space. (NRS 108.4753) Existing law authorizes an owner to
5 sell certain personal property of the occupant to satisfy the lien after the owner has provided
6 certain notices to the occupant. (NRS 108.476, 108.4763, 108.477) Existing law: (1) requires
7 the owner to advertise a sale to satisfy a lien once a week for 2 consecutive weeks
8 immediately preceding the date of the sale in a newspaper of general circulation in the judicial
9 district where the sale is to be held; and (2) sets forth the requirements for the contents of such
10 an advertisement. If there is no newspaper of general circulation in the judicial district
11 where the sale is to be held, existing law requires the advertisement to be posted 10 days
12 before the sale in at least six conspicuous places near the place of the sale. (NRS 108.477)
13 This bill revises those requirements concerning the advertising of sales of personal
14 property to satisfy the lien of an owner of a facility for storage to instead [requires that the
15 advertisement appear in a newspaper of general circulation in the county, rather than the
16 judicial district, where the sale is to be held. This bill also authorizes] require an owner [, in
17 lieu of advertising] to advertise the sale in a newspaper of general circulation [, to advertise
18 the sale for a period of 10 consecutive days] at least one time in the week immediately
19 preceding the date of the sale . If there is no newspaper of general circulation in the
20 judicial district where the sale is to be held, this bill authorizes an owner, as an
21 alternative to posting the advertisement in at least six conspicuous places near the place
22 of the sale, to post the advertisement on an Internet website which is publicly accessible
23 [and which customarily advertises or conducts sales of property.] 10 days before the sale.
24 This bill also revises the required contents of an advertisement for such a sale to eliminate the
25 requirement that the advertisement contain a general description of the personal property to be
26 sold.
