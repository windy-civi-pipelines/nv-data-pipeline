EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to liens; revising certain requirements for the advertising of a sale
of personal property to satisfy the lien of an owner of a facility for
storage; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides, in general, that if the occupant of a storage space at a facility for
2 storage defaults on the payment of rent or other charges that are due to the owner of the
3 facility pursuant to a rental agreement, the owner has a lien on the personal property of the
4 occupant contained in the storage space. (NRS 108.4753) Existing law authorizes an owner to
5 sell certain personal property of the occupant to satisfy the lien after the owner has provided
6 certain notices to the occupant. (NRS 108.476, 108.4763, 108.477) Existing law: (1) requires
7 the owner to advertise a sale to satisfy a lien once a week for 2 consecutive weeks
8 immediately preceding the date of the sale in a newspaper of general circulation in the judicial
9 district where the sale is to be held; and (2) sets forth the requirements for the contents of such
10 an advertisement. (NRS 108.477) This bill instead requires that the advertisement appear in a
11 newspaper of general circulation in the county, rather than the judicial district, where the sale
12 is to be held. This bill also authorizes an owner, in lieu of advertising in a newspaper of
13 general circulation, to advertise the sale for a period of 10 consecutive days immediately
14 preceding the date of the sale on an Internet website which is publicly accessible and which
15 customarily advertises or conducts sales of property. This bill also revises the required
16 contents of an advertisement for such a sale to eliminate the requirement that the
17 advertisement contain a general description of the personal property to be sold.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 108.477 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 108.477 1. If the declaration in opposition to the lien sale executed by the
3 occupant is not received by the date of the sale specified in the notice mailed to the
4 occupant, the owner may sell the property.
5 2. The owner shall advertise the sale [once] :

1 (a) Once a week for 2 consecutive weeks immediately preceding the date of
2 the sale in a newspaper of general circulation in the [judicial district] county where
3 the sale is to be held [.] ; or
4 (b) For a period of 10 consecutive days immediately preceding the date of the
5 sale on an Internet website which is publicly accessible and which customarily
6 advertises or conducts sales of property.
7 3. The advertisement required pursuant to subsection 2 must contain:
8 (a) [A general description of the personal property to be sold;
9 (b)] The name of the occupant;
10 [(c)] (b) The number of the individual storage space at the facility where the
11 personal property was stored; and
12 [(d)] (c) The name and address of the facility.
13 [3.] 4. If there is no newspaper of general circulation in the [judicial district]
14 county where the sale is to be held [,] and the owner does not advertise the sale in
15 the manner specified in paragraph (b) of subsection 2, the advertisement must be
16 posted 10 days before the sale in at least six conspicuous places near the place of
17 the sale.
18 [4.] 5. The sale must be conducted in a commercially reasonable manner.
19 [5.] 6. After deducting the amount of the lien and the costs of the sale, the
20 owner shall retain any excess proceeds from the sale on the behalf of the occupant.
21 [6.] 7. The occupant or any person authorized by the occupant or by an order
22 of the court may claim the excess proceeds or the portion of the proceeds necessary
23 to satisfy the person’s claim at any time within 1 year after the date of the sale.
24 After 1 year, the owner shall pay any proceeds remaining from the sale to the
25 treasurer of the county where the sale was held for deposit in the general fund of the
26 county.
