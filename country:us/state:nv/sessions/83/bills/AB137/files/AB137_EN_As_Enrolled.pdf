Assembly Bill No. 137–Assemblymembers
Torres-Fossett; and Hansen
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to liens; revising certain requirements for the
advertising of a sale of personal property to satisfy the lien of
an owner of a facility for storage; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law provides, in general, that if the occupant of a storage space at a
facility for storage defaults on the payment of rent or other charges that are due to
the owner of the facility pursuant to a rental agreement, the owner has a lien on the
personal property of the occupant contained in the storage space. (NRS 108.4753)
Existing law authorizes an owner to sell certain personal property of the occupant
to satisfy the lien after the owner has provided certain notices to the occupant.
(NRS 108.476, 108.4763, 108.477) Existing law: (1) requires the owner to
advertise a sale to satisfy a lien once a week for 2 consecutive weeks immediately
preceding the date of the sale in a newspaper of general circulation in the judicial
district where the sale is to be held; and (2) sets forth the requirements for the
contents of such an advertisement. If there is no newspaper of general circulation in
the judicial district where the sale is to be held, existing law requires the
advertisement to be posted 10 days before the sale in at least six conspicuous places
near the place of the sale. (NRS 108.477) This bill revises those requirements
concerning the advertising of sales of personal property to satisfy the lien of an
owner of a facility for storage to instead require an owner to advertise the sale in a
newspaper of general circulation at least one time in the week immediately
preceding the date of the sale. If there is no newspaper of general circulation in the
judicial district where the sale is to be held, this bill authorizes an owner, as an
alternative to posting the advertisement in at least six conspicuous places near the
place of the sale, to post the advertisement on an Internet website which is publicly
accessible 10 days before the sale. This bill also revises the required contents of an
advertisement for such a sale to eliminate the requirement that the advertisement
contain a general description of the personal property to be sold.
