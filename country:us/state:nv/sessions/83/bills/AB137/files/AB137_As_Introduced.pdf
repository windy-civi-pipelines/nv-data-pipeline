EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to liens; revising certain requirements for the
advertising of a sale of personal property to satisfy the
lien of an owner of a facility for storage; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides, in general, that if the occupant of a storage space at a
2 facility for storage defaults on the payment of rent or other charges that are due to
3 the owner of the facility pursuant to a rental agreement, the owner has a lien on the
4 personal property of the occupant contained in the storage space. (NRS 108.4753)
5 Existing law authorizes an owner to sell certain personal property of the occupant
6 to satisfy the lien after the owner has provided certain notices to the occupant.
7 (NRS 108.476, 108.4763, 108.477) Existing law: (1) requires the owner to
8 advertise a sale to satisfy a lien once a week for 2 consecutive weeks immediately
9 preceding the date of the sale in a newspaper of general circulation in the judicial
10 district where the sale is to be held; and (2) sets forth the requirements for the
11 contents of such an advertisement. (NRS 108.477) This bill instead requires that the
12 advertisement appear in a newspaper of general circulation in the county, rather
13 than the judicial district, where the sale is to be held. This bill also authorizes an
14 owner, in lieu of advertising in a newspaper of general circulation, to advertise the
15 sale for a period of 10 consecutive days immediately preceding the date of the sale
16 on an Internet website which is publicly accessible and which customarily
17 advertises or conducts sales of property. This bill also revises the required contents
18 of an advertisement for such a sale to eliminate the requirement that the
19 advertisement contain a general description of the personal property to be sold.
