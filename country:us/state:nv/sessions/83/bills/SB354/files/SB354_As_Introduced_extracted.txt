8 695C.1743, 695G.1705) Existing law prohibits such health plans from
9 implementing any medical management techniques on the coverage of such drugs
10 or services, except the use of step therapy. (NRS 287.010, 287.04335, 689A.0437,

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:

3 drugs that prevent the acquisition of human immunodeficiency virus or that treat
4 human immunodeficiency virus or hepatitis C; (2) related laboratory and diagnostic
5 procedures; and (3) certain other services to test for, prevent or treat human
6 immunodeficiency virus or hepatitis C. (NRS 287.010, 287.04335, 422.4025,
7 689A.0437, 689B.0312, 689C.1671, 695A.1843, 695B.1924, 695C.050,
8 695C.1743, 695G.1705) Existing law prohibits such health plans from
9 implementing any medical management techniques on the coverage of such drugs
10 or services, except the use of step therapy. (NRS 287.010, 287.04335, 689A.0437,
