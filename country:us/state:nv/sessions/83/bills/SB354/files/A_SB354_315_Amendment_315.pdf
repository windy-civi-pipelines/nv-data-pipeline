EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to insurance; prohibiting certain health plans from requiring step
therapy before providing coverage for certain prescription drugs for the
prevention of human immunodeficiency virus or the treatment of
human immunodeficiency virus or hepatitis C; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires certain public and private health plans, including [Medicaid and
2 health plans for state and local government employees,] the Public Employees’ Benefits
3 Program, to cover: (1) drugs that prevent the acquisition of human immunodeficiency virus
4 or that treat human immunodeficiency virus or hepatitis C; (2) related laboratory and
5 diagnostic procedures; and (3) certain other services to test for, prevent or treat human
6 immunodeficiency virus or hepatitis C. (NRS [287.010,] 287.04335, [422.4025,] 689A.0437,
7 689B.0312, 689C.1671, 695A.1843, 695B.1924, 695C.050, 695C.1743, 695G.1705) Existing
8 law prohibits such health plans from implementing any medical management techniques on
9 the coverage of such drugs or services, except the use of step therapy. (NRS 287.010,
10 287.04335, 689A.0437, 689B.0312, 689C.1671, 695A.1843, 695B.1924, 695C.050,
11 695C.1743, 695G.1705) [This] Sections 1-7 of this bill [removes] remove the exemption for
12 step therapy [,] for private health plans, thereby prohibiting such [public and private] health
13 plans from requiring step therapy before providing coverage for a drug that: (1) prevents the
14 acquisition of human immunodeficiency virus; or (2) treats human immunodeficiency virus or
15 hepatitis C. Sections 6-8.5 of this bill authorize the Public Employees’ Benefits Program
16 and Medicaid managed care organizations to continue requiring the use of step therapy
17 for coverage of such drugs as a medical management technique.
