circumstances; requiring the Board to adopt regulations governing hold

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of persons and establishments in
2 the cannabis industry in this State by the Cannabis Compliance Board. (Title 56 of NRS)
3 Section 6 of this bill authorizes an agent of the Board to issue a hold order for cannabis or a
4 cannabis product to prohibit a person from transferring or moving the cannabis or cannabis
5 product without the approval of the Board or an agent of the Board only in accordance with
6 regulations adopted by the Board. Section 6 requires the Board to adopt such regulations
7 governing hold orders and sets forth certain requirements for the content of those regulations.
8 Existing law defines “adult-use cannabis production facility” and “medical cannabis
9 production facility” to mean a business that acquires, possesses, manufactures, delivers,
10 transfers, supplies or sells adult-use cannabis products to adult-use cannabis retail stores or
11 medical cannabis products to medical cannabis dispensaries, as applicable. (NRS 678A.060,
12 678A.205) Sections 8 and 9 of this bill revise those definitions to allow an adult-use cannabis
13 production facility and medical cannabis production facility to engage in the acquisition,
14 possession, packaging, supplying or selling of usable cannabis to adult-use cannabis retail
15 stores or medical cannabis dispensaries, as applicable. Sections 5 and 17 of this bill revise the
16 definition of “usable cannabis” set forth under existing law to exclude the seeds of a plant of
17 the genus Cannabis and apply this definition throughout the provisions of existing law
18 governing the medical and adult use of cannabis. Section 15 of this bill makes a conforming
19 change to eliminate a reference to a provision that was repealed in section 17. Section 13.5 of
20 this bill authorizes a cannabis cultivation facility and a cannabis production facility to

Assembly Amendment No. 658 to Senate Bill No. 168 First Reprint Page 4
21 acquire, possess, deliver, transfer, supply or sell the seeds of a plant of the genus
22 Cannabis, branded merchandise and supplies related to cannabis to persons located
23 within and outside this State, subject to certain requirements and restrictions.
24 Existing law authorizes the Board to adopt regulations setting forth requirements relating
25 to the packaging and labeling of cannabis and cannabis products. (NRS 678A.450) Section 10
26 of this bill prohibits those requirements from requiring: (1) a package of cannabis or cannabis
27 products which is sold at wholesale to contain any label or tag other than a label or tag
28 necessary for the functionality of any computer software used for the seed-to-sale tracking of
29 cannabis adopted by the Board; and (2) a cannabis establishment to include any information
30 on the label for any cannabis or a cannabis product that is already included on the packaging
31 for the cannabis or cannabis product. Section 14 of this bill revises requirements concerning
32 the labeling of cannabis products for the purpose of allowing information required to be
33 included on a label to instead be included on packaging. Sections 3 and 4 of this bill define
34 the terms “label” and “packaging” for the purposes of the provisions of existing law governing
35 the medical and adult use of cannabis.
36 Section 12 of this bill requires the Board to develop and maintain standardized checklists
37 for any item for which the Board requires a licensee to obtain the approval of the Board before
38 it is used by the licensee. Section 13 of this bill requires the Board to post on its Internet
39 website a list of frequently asked questions pertaining to the operations of licensees.
40 Existing law requires an adult-use cannabis product to be sold in a single package. (NRS
41 678D.420) Section 16 of this bill provides that cannabis, as well as adult-use cannabis
42 products, sold to a consumer must be sold in a single package and revises requirements
43 concerning the amount of usable cannabis and THC that a single package may contain.
44 Section 16 requires a single package containing an infused pre-roll, as defined in section 2 of
45 this bill, to contain a net weight of not more than 7 grams.
