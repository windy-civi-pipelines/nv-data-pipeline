[and concentrated cannabis] that may be contained in a single package
[;] of cannabis or cannabis products; imposing requirements

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of persons and establishments in
2 the cannabis industry in this State by the Cannabis Compliance Board. (Title 56 of NRS)
3 Section [1] 6 of this bill authorizes an agent of the Board to issue a hold order for cannabis or
4 a cannabis product to prohibit a person from transferring [,] or moving [or disturbing] the
5 cannabis or cannabis product without the approval of the Board or an agent of the Board only
6 in accordance with regulations adopted by the Board. Section [1] 6 requires the Board to
7 adopt such regulations governing hold orders and sets forth certain requirements for the
8 content of those regulations.
9 Existing law defines “adult-use cannabis production facility” and “medical cannabis
10 production facility” to mean a business that acquires, possesses, manufactures, delivers,
11 transfers, supplies or sells adult-use cannabis products to adult-use cannabis retail stores
12 or medical cannabis products to medical cannabis dispensaries, as applicable. (NRS
13 678A.060, 678A.205) Sections 8 and 9 of this bill revise those definitions to allow an
14 adult-use cannabis production facility and medical cannabis production facility to
15 engage in the acquisition, possession, packaging, supplying or selling of usable cannabis
16 to adult-use cannabis retail stores or medical cannabis dispensaries, as applicable.
17 Sections 5 and 17 of this bill revise the definition of “usable cannabis” set forth under
18 existing law to exclude the seeds of a plant of the genus Cannabis and apply this
19 definition throughout the provisions of existing law governing the medical and adult use
Senate Amendment No. 27 to Senate Bill No. 168 Page 4
20 of cannabis. Section 15 of this bill makes a conforming change to eliminate a reference to
21 a provision that was repealed in section 17.
22 Existing law authorizes the Board to adopt regulations setting forth requirements
23 relating to the packaging and labeling of cannabis and cannabis products. (NRS
24 678A.450) Section 10 of this bill prohibits those requirements from requiring: (1) a
25 package of cannabis or cannabis products which is sold at wholesale to contain any label
26 or tag other than a label or tag necessary for the functionality of any computer software
27 used for the seed-to-sale tracking of cannabis adopted by the Board; and (2) a cannabis
28 establishment to include any information on the label for any cannabis or a cannabis
29 product that is already included on the packaging for the cannabis or cannabis product.
30 Section 14 of this bill revises requirements concerning the labeling of cannabis products
31 for the purpose of allowing information required to be included on a label to instead be
32 included on packaging. Sections 3 and 4 define the terms “label” and “packaging” for
33 the purposes of the provisions of existing law governing the medical and adult use of
34 cannabis.
35 Section 12 of this bill requires the Board to develop and maintain standardized
36 checklists for any item for which the Board requires a licensee to obtain the approval of
37 the Board before it is used by the licensee. Section 13 of this bill requires the Board to
38 post on its Internet website a list of frequently asked questions pertaining to the
39 operations of licensees.
40 Existing law requires an adult-use cannabis product to be sold in a single package. (NRS
41 678D.420) Section [2] 16 of this bill provides that cannabis, as well as adult-use cannabis
42 products, sold to a consumer must be sold in a single package and revises requirements
43 concerning the amount of usable cannabis [,] and THC [and concentrated cannabis] that a
44 single package may contain. Section 16 requires a single package containing an infused
45 pre-roll, as defined in section 1 of this bill, to contain a net weight of not more than 7
46 grams.

38 to determine the percentage of persons who are less than 21 years of age and who
39 may reasonably be expected to view or hear the advertisement, the cannabis
40 establishment shall maintain documentation for not less than 5 years after the date
41 on which the advertisement is first broadcasted, published or otherwise displayed
42 that demonstrates the manner in which the cannabis establishment determined the
43 reasonably expected age of the audience for that advertisement.
44 15. To the extent that they are inconsistent or otherwise conflict with the
45 regulations adopted by the Board pursuant to NRS 678D.480, the requirements of
46 this section pertaining to cannabis products do not apply to ready-to-consume
47 cannabis products prepared and sold by a cannabis consumption lounge.

49 impose a civil penalty upon a cannabis establishment that violates the provisions of

SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to cannabis. (BDR 56-553)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to cannabis; revising requirements for the packaging and
labeling of cannabis and cannabis products; revising the definition
of “usable cannabis”; authorizing an agent of the Cannabis
Compliance Board to issue a hold order for cannabis or a cannabis
product only under certain circumstances; requiring the Board to adopt
regulations governing hold orders; authorizing a cannabis
production facility to engage in certain activities; requiring the
Board to develop and maintain certain checklists; requiring the
Board to post certain information on its Internet website; revising
requirements concerning the amount of usable cannabis [,] and THC
[and concentrated cannabis] that may be contained in a single package
[;] of cannabis or cannabis products; imposing requirements
concerning a single package of an infused pre-roll; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of persons and establishments in
2 the cannabis industry in this State by the Cannabis Compliance Board. (Title 56 of NRS)
3 Section [1] 6 of this bill authorizes an agent of the Board to issue a hold order for cannabis or
4 a cannabis product to prohibit a person from transferring [,] or moving [or disturbing] the
5 cannabis or cannabis product without the approval of the Board or an agent of the Board only
6 in accordance with regulations adopted by the Board. Section [1] 6 requires the Board to
7 adopt such regulations governing hold orders and sets forth certain requirements for the
8 content of those regulations.
9 Existing law defines “adult-use cannabis production facility” and “medical cannabis
10 production facility” to mean a business that acquires, possesses, manufactures, delivers,
11 transfers, supplies or sells adult-use cannabis products to adult-use cannabis retail stores
12 or medical cannabis products to medical cannabis dispensaries, as applicable. (NRS
13 678A.060, 678A.205) Sections 8 and 9 of this bill revise those definitions to allow an
14 adult-use cannabis production facility and medical cannabis production facility to
15 engage in the acquisition, possession, packaging, supplying or selling of usable cannabis
16 to adult-use cannabis retail stores or medical cannabis dispensaries, as applicable.
17 Sections 5 and 17 of this bill revise the definition of “usable cannabis” set forth under
18 existing law to exclude the seeds of a plant of the genus Cannabis and apply this
19 definition throughout the provisions of existing law governing the medical and adult use

Senate Amendment No. 27 to Senate Bill No. 168 Page 4
20 of cannabis. Section 15 of this bill makes a conforming change to eliminate a reference to
21 a provision that was repealed in section 17.
22 Existing law authorizes the Board to adopt regulations setting forth requirements
23 relating to the packaging and labeling of cannabis and cannabis products. (NRS
24 678A.450) Section 10 of this bill prohibits those requirements from requiring: (1) a
25 package of cannabis or cannabis products which is sold at wholesale to contain any label
26 or tag other than a label or tag necessary for the functionality of any computer software
27 used for the seed-to-sale tracking of cannabis adopted by the Board; and (2) a cannabis
28 establishment to include any information on the label for any cannabis or a cannabis
29 product that is already included on the packaging for the cannabis or cannabis product.
30 Section 14 of this bill revises requirements concerning the labeling of cannabis products
31 for the purpose of allowing information required to be included on a label to instead be
32 included on packaging. Sections 3 and 4 define the terms “label” and “packaging” for
33 the purposes of the provisions of existing law governing the medical and adult use of
34 cannabis.
35 Section 12 of this bill requires the Board to develop and maintain standardized
36 checklists for any item for which the Board requires a licensee to obtain the approval of
37 the Board before it is used by the licensee. Section 13 of this bill requires the Board to
38 post on its Internet website a list of frequently asked questions pertaining to the
39 operations of licensees.
40 Existing law requires an adult-use cannabis product to be sold in a single package. (NRS
41 678D.420) Section [2] 16 of this bill provides that cannabis, as well as adult-use cannabis
42 products, sold to a consumer must be sold in a single package and revises requirements
43 concerning the amount of usable cannabis [,] and THC [and concentrated cannabis] that a
44 single package may contain. Section 16 requires a single package containing an infused
45 pre-roll, as defined in section 1 of this bill, to contain a net weight of not more than 7
46 grams.

SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

20 terminated. Such circumstances must include, without limitation, for cannabis or

23 upon retesting of the cannabis or cannabis product.
24 (f) Require the Board to publish guidelines concerning hold orders which
25 are based on investigations conducted by the Board relating to such hold orders.

41 on which the advertisement is first broadcasted, published or otherwise displayed
42 that demonstrates the manner in which the cannabis establishment determined the
43 reasonably expected age of the audience for that advertisement.
44 15. To the extent that they are inconsistent or otherwise conflict with the
45 regulations adopted by the Board pursuant to NRS 678D.480, the requirements of
46 this section pertaining to cannabis products do not apply to ready-to-consume
47 cannabis products prepared and sold by a cannabis consumption lounge.

49 impose a civil penalty upon a cannabis establishment that violates the provisions of
50 subsection 11 or 14 as follows:
