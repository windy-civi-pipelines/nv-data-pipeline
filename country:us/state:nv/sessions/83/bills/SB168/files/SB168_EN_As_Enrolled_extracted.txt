Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of persons and
establishments in the cannabis industry in this State by the Cannabis Compliance
Board. (Title 56 of NRS) Section 6 of this bill authorizes an agent of the Board to
issue a hold order for cannabis or a cannabis product to prohibit a person from
transferring or moving the cannabis or cannabis product without the approval of the
Board or an agent of the Board only in accordance with regulations adopted by the
Board. Section 6 requires the Board to adopt such regulations governing hold
orders and sets forth certain requirements for the content of those regulations.
Existing law defines “adult-use cannabis production facility” and “medical
cannabis production facility” to mean a business that acquires, possesses,
manufactures, delivers, transfers, supplies or sells adult-use cannabis products to
adult-use cannabis retail stores or medical cannabis products to medical cannabis
dispensaries, as applicable. (NRS 678A.060, 678A.205) Sections 8 and 9 of this
bill revise those definitions to allow an adult-use cannabis production facility and
medical cannabis production facility to engage in the acquisition, possession,
packaging, supplying or selling of usable cannabis to adult-use cannabis retail
stores or medical cannabis dispensaries, as applicable. Sections 5 and 17 of this bill
revise the definition of “usable cannabis” set forth under existing law to exclude the
seeds of a plant of the genus Cannabis and apply this definition throughout the
provisions of existing law governing the medical and adult use of cannabis. Section
15 of this bill makes a conforming change to eliminate a reference to a provision
that was repealed in section 17. Section 13.5 of this bill authorizes a cannabis
cultivation facility and a cannabis production facility to acquire, possess, deliver,
transfer, supply or sell the seeds of a plant of the genus Cannabis, branded
merchandise and supplies related to cannabis to persons located within and outside
this State, subject to certain requirements and restrictions.
Existing law authorizes the Board to adopt regulations setting forth
requirements relating to the packaging and labeling of cannabis and cannabis
products. (NRS 678A.450) Section 10 of this bill prohibits those requirements from
-
83rd Session (2025)

requiring: (1) a package of cannabis or cannabis products which is sold at
wholesale to contain any label or tag other than a label or tag necessary for the
functionality of any computer software used for the seed-to-sale tracking of
cannabis adopted by the Board; and (2) a cannabis establishment to include any
information on the label for any cannabis or a cannabis product that is already
included on the packaging for the cannabis or cannabis product. Section 14 of this
bill revises requirements concerning the labeling of cannabis products for the
purpose of allowing information required to be included on a label to instead be
included on packaging. Sections 3 and 4 of this bill define the terms “label” and
“packaging” for the purposes of the provisions of existing law governing the
medical and adult use of cannabis.

Section 2:
Section 12 of this bill requires the Board to develop and maintain standardized
checklists for any item for which the Board requires a licensee to obtain the
approval of the Board before it is used by the licensee. Section 13 of this bill
requires the Board to post on its Internet website a list of frequently asked questions
pertaining to the operations of licensees.
Existing law requires an adult-use cannabis product to be sold in a single
package. (NRS 678D.420) Section 16 of this bill provides that cannabis, as well as
adult-use cannabis products, sold to a consumer must be sold in a single package
and revises requirements concerning the amount of usable cannabis and THC that a
single package may contain. Section 16 requires a single package containing an
infused pre-roll, as defined in section 2 of this bill, to contain a net weight of not
more than 7 grams.

Raw Text:
Senate Bill No. 168–Senator Nguyen
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to cannabis; revising requirements for the
packaging and labeling of cannabis and cannabis products;
revising the definition of “usable cannabis”; authorizing an
agent of the Cannabis Compliance Board to issue a hold
order for cannabis or a cannabis product only under certain
circumstances; requiring the Board to adopt regulations
governing hold orders; authorizing a cannabis cultivation
facility and a cannabis production facility to engage in certain
activities; requiring the Board to develop and maintain
certain checklists; requiring the Board to post certain
information on its Internet website; revising requirements
concerning the amount of usable cannabis and THC that may
be contained in a single package of cannabis or cannabis
products; imposing requirements concerning a single package
of an infused pre-roll; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of persons and
establishments in the cannabis industry in this State by the Cannabis Compliance
Board. (Title 56 of NRS) Section 6 of this bill authorizes an agent of the Board to
issue a hold order for cannabis or a cannabis product to prohibit a person from
transferring or moving the cannabis or cannabis product without the approval of the
Board or an agent of the Board only in accordance with regulations adopted by the
Board. Section 6 requires the Board to adopt such regulations governing hold
orders and sets forth certain requirements for the content of those regulations.
Existing law defines “adult-use cannabis production facility” and “medical
cannabis production facility” to mean a business that acquires, possesses,
manufactures, delivers, transfers, supplies or sells adult-use cannabis products to
adult-use cannabis retail stores or medical cannabis products to medical cannabis
dispensaries, as applicable. (NRS 678A.060, 678A.205) Sections 8 and 9 of this
bill revise those definitions to allow an adult-use cannabis production facility and
medical cannabis production facility to engage in the acquisition, possession,
packaging, supplying or selling of usable cannabis to adult-use cannabis retail
stores or medical cannabis dispensaries, as applicable. Sections 5 and 17 of this bill
revise the definition of “usable cannabis” set forth under existing law to exclude the
seeds of a plant of the genus Cannabis and apply this definition throughout the
provisions of existing law governing the medical and adult use of cannabis. Section
15 of this bill makes a conforming change to eliminate a reference to a provision
that was repealed in section 17. Section 13.5 of this bill authorizes a cannabis
cultivation facility and a cannabis production facility to acquire, possess, deliver,
transfer, supply or sell the seeds of a plant of the genus Cannabis, branded
merchandise and supplies related to cannabis to persons located within and outside
this State, subject to certain requirements and restrictions.
Existing law authorizes the Board to adopt regulations setting forth
requirements relating to the packaging and labeling of cannabis and cannabis
products. (NRS 678A.450) Section 10 of this bill prohibits those requirements from
-

requiring: (1) a package of cannabis or cannabis products which is sold at
wholesale to contain any label or tag other than a label or tag necessary for the
functionality of any computer software used for the seed-to-sale tracking of
cannabis adopted by the Board; and (2) a cannabis establishment to include any
information on the label for any cannabis or a cannabis product that is already
included on the packaging for the cannabis or cannabis product. Section 14 of this
bill revises requirements concerning the labeling of cannabis products for the
purpose of allowing information required to be included on a label to instead be
included on packaging. Sections 3 and 4 of this bill define the terms “label” and
“packaging” for the purposes of the provisions of existing law governing the
medical and adult use of cannabis.
Section 12 of this bill requires the Board to develop and maintain standardized
checklists for any item for which the Board requires a licensee to obtain the
approval of the Board before it is used by the licensee. Section 13 of this bill
requires the Board to post on its Internet website a list of frequently asked questions
pertaining to the operations of licensees.
Existing law requires an adult-use cannabis product to be sold in a single
package. (NRS 678D.420) Section 16 of this bill provides that cannabis, as well as
adult-use cannabis products, sold to a consumer must be sold in a single package
and revises requirements concerning the amount of usable cannabis and THC that a
single package may contain. Section 16 requires a single package containing an
infused pre-roll, as defined in section 2 of this bill, to contain a net weight of not
more than 7 grams.

orders which are based on investigations conducted by the Board
