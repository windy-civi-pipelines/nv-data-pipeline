Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of persons and
2 establishments in the cannabis industry in this State by the Cannabis Compliance
3 Board. (Title 56 of NRS) Section 6 of this bill authorizes an agent of the Board to
4 issue a hold order for cannabis or a cannabis product to prohibit a person from
5 transferring or moving the cannabis or cannabis product without the approval of the
6 Board or an agent of the Board only in accordance with regulations adopted by the
7 Board. Section 6 requires the Board to adopt such regulations governing hold
8 orders and sets forth certain requirements for the content of those regulations.
9 Existing law defines “adult-use cannabis production facility” and “medical
10 cannabis production facility” to mean a business that acquires, possesses,
11 manufactures, delivers, transfers, supplies or sells adult-use cannabis products to
-
*SB168_R1*

– 2 –
12 adult-use cannabis retail stores or medical cannabis products to medical cannabis
13 dispensaries, as applicable. (NRS 678A.060, 678A.205) Sections 8 and 9 of this
14 bill revise those definitions to allow an adult-use cannabis production facility and
15 medical cannabis production facility to engage in the acquisition, possession,
16 packaging, supplying or selling of usable cannabis to adult-use cannabis retail
17 stores or medical cannabis dispensaries, as applicable. Sections 5 and 17 of this bill
18 revise the definition of “usable cannabis” set forth under existing law to exclude the
19 seeds of a plant of the genus Cannabis and apply this definition throughout the
20 provisions of existing law governing the medical and adult use of cannabis. Section
21 15 of this bill makes a conforming change to eliminate a reference to a provision
22 that was repealed in section 17.
23 Existing law authorizes the Board to adopt regulations setting forth
24 requirements relating to the packaging and labeling of cannabis and cannabis
25 products. (NRS 678A.450) Section 10 of this bill prohibits those requirements from
26 requiring: (1) a package of cannabis or cannabis products which is sold at
27 wholesale to contain any label or tag other than a label or tag necessary for the
28 functionality of any computer software used for the seed-to-sale tracking of
29 cannabis adopted by the Board; and (2) a cannabis establishment to include any
30 information on the label for any cannabis or a cannabis product that is already
31 included on the packaging for the cannabis or cannabis product. Section 14 of this
32 bill revises requirements concerning the labeling of cannabis products for the
33 purpose of allowing information required to be included on a label to instead be
34 included on packaging. Sections 3 and 4 define the terms “label” and “packaging”
35 for the purposes of the provisions of existing law governing the medical and adult
36 use of cannabis.
37 Section 12 of this bill requires the Board to develop and maintain standardized
38 checklists for any item for which the Board requires a licensee to obtain the
39 approval of the Board before it is used by the licensee. Section 13 of this bill
40 requires the Board to post on its Internet website a list of frequently asked questions
41 pertaining to the operations of licensees.
42 Existing law requires an adult-use cannabis product to be sold in a single
43 package. (NRS 678D.420) Section 16 of this bill provides that cannabis, as well as
44 adult-use cannabis products, sold to a consumer must be sold in a single package
45 and revises requirements concerning the amount of usable cannabis and THC that a
46 single package may contain. Section 16 requires a single package containing an
47 infused pre-roll, as defined in section 1 of this bill, to contain a net weight of not
48 more than 7 grams.
