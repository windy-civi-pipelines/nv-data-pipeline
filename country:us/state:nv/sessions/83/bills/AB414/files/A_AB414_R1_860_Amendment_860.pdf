EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to occupational safety; revising the requirements of written safety
programs in certain workplaces to include programs related to
mitigation of certain air quality issues; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Division of Industrial Relations of the Department of Business
2 and Industry to provide for the establishment and supervision of programs for the education
3 and training of employers and employees on certain unsafe or unhealthful working conditions.
4 (NRS 618.353) Existing law requires certain employers to establish a written safety program
5 and implement the safety program within 90 days after it is established. (NRS 618.383)
6 If an employer has more than 15 employees who work at a large hybrid environment
7 facility, sections 3 and 5 of this bill require, with certain exceptions, such a written safety
8 program to include the establishment of a program to mitigate occupational exposure to
9 greenhouse gases, other gases and poor air quality. Section 2 of this bill defines the term
10 “large hybrid environment facility” to mean, in general, a facility where employees work: (1)
11 that is at least 10,000 square feet; and (2) at which workers are exposed to outdoor elements
12 for a majority of each shift worked, including, without limitation, through open loading docks
13 or bay doors. Section 4 of this bill makes a conforming change so that the definition of “large
14 hybrid environment facility” applies to the provisions of existing law governing occupational
15 safety and health.
16 Section 3 requires a written safety program relating to a large hybrid environment facility
17 to include provisions that require the establishment of: (1) a system to mitigate exposure to
18 certain air quality issues in accordance with occupational safety and health standards; and (2)
19 a system for monitoring employees for signs of health effects resulting from exposure to
20 certain air quality issues. Section 3 also requires such a program to contain provisions which:
21 (1) require any vehicle which is loading or unloading at the facility to have the engine of the
22 vehicle turned off; (2) require a designated person at the facility, not less than every 4 hours

Assembly Amendment No. 860 to Assembly Bill No. 414 First Reprint Page 4
23 when employees are working, to monitor and record certain air quality information in each
24 area of the facility where employees are working; and (3) take certain actions if the air quality
25 information exceeds any relevant occupational safety and health standards. Section 3 exempts
26 from those requirements state agencies and certain employers who are engaged in: (1) law
27 enforcement, firefighting or otherwise responding to emergencies; (2) solid waste
28 management or the management of hazardous waste; or (3) towing services.
