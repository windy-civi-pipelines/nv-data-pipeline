EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to occupational safety; revising the requirements of written safety
programs in certain workplaces to include programs related to
mitigation of [heat illness and] certain air quality issues; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Division of Industrial Relations of the Department of Business
2 and Industry to provide for the establishment and supervision of programs for the education
3 and training of employers and employees on certain unsafe or unhealthful working conditions.
4 (NRS 618.353) Existing law requires certain employers to establish a written safety program
5 and implement the safety program within 90 days after it is established. (NRS 618.383)
6 If an employer has more than 15 employees who work at a large hybrid environment
7 facility, sections 3 and 5 of this bill require , with certain exceptions, such a written safety
8 program to include the establishment of a program to mitigate occupational exposure to [heat
9 illness and exposure to] greenhouse gases, other gases [or fumes] and poor air quality. Section
10 2 of this bill defines the term “large hybrid environment facility” to mean, in general, a facility
11 where employees work: (1) that is at least 10,000 square feet; and (2) at which workers are
12 exposed to outdoor elements for a majority of each shift worked, including, without limitation,
13 through open loading docks or bay doors. Section 4 of this bill makes a conforming change so
14 that the definition of “large hybrid environment facility” applies to the provisions of existing
15 law governing occupational safety and health.
16 Section 3 requires a written safety [plan] program relating to a large hybrid environment
17 facility to include provisions that require the establishment of: (1) [systems for monitoring
18 employees for signs of heat illness; (2) procedures for responding to a medical emergency
19 related to heat illness; (3)] a system to mitigate exposure to certain air quality issues in
20 accordance with occupational safety and health standards; and [(4)] (2) a system for
21 monitoring employees for signs of health effects resulting from exposure to certain air quality
22 issues. Section 3 also requires such a [plan] program to contain provisions which: (1) require

Assembly Amendment No. 477 to Assembly Bill No. 414 Page 4
23 any vehicle which is loading or unloading at the facility to have the engine of the vehicle
24 turned off; (2) require a designated person at the facility, not less than every 4 hours when
25 employees are working, to monitor and record [the temperature and] certain air quality
26 information in [any] each area of the facility where employees are working; and (3) take
27 certain actions if the [recorded temperature or] air quality information exceeds [103 degrees
28 Fahrenheit or] any relevant occupational safety and health standards. Section 3 exempts from
29 those requirements certain employers who are engaged in: (1) law enforcement,
30 firefighting or otherwise responding to emergencies; (2) solid waste management or the
31 management of hazardous waste; or (3) towing services.
