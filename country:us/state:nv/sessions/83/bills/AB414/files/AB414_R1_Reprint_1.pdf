EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to occupational safety; revising the requirements
of written safety programs in certain workplaces to
include programs related to mitigation of certain air
quality issues; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Division of Industrial Relations of the Department of
2 Business and Industry to provide for the establishment and supervision of programs
3 for the education and training of employers and employees on certain unsafe or
4 unhealthful working conditions. (NRS 618.353) Existing law requires certain
5 employers to establish a written safety program and implement the safety program
6 within 90 days after it is established. (NRS 618.383)
7 If an employer has more than 15 employees who work at a large hybrid
8 environment facility, sections 3 and 5 of this bill require, with certain exceptions,
9 such a written safety program to include the establishment of a program to mitigate
10 occupational exposure to greenhouse gases, other gases and poor air quality.
11 Section 2 of this bill defines the term “large hybrid environment facility” to mean,
12 in general, a facility where employees work: (1) that is at least 10,000 square feet;
13 and (2) at which workers are exposed to outdoor elements for a majority of each
14 shift worked, including, without limitation, through open loading docks or bay
15 doors. Section 4 of this bill makes a conforming change so that the definition of
-

– 2 –
16 “large hybrid environment facility” applies to the provisions of existing law
17 governing occupational safety and health.
18 Section 3 requires a written safety program relating to a large hybrid
19 environment facility to include provisions that require the establishment of: (1) a
20 system to mitigate exposure to certain air quality issues in accordance with
21 occupational safety and health standards; and (2) a system for monitoring
22 employees for signs of health effects resulting from exposure to certain air quality
23 issues. Section 3 also requires such a program to contain provisions which: (1)
24 require any vehicle which is loading or unloading at the facility to have the engine
25 of the vehicle turned off; (2) require a designated person at the facility, not less than
26 every 4 hours when employees are working, to monitor and record certain air
27 quality information in each area of the facility where employees are working; and
28 (3) take certain actions if the air quality information exceeds any relevant
29 occupational safety and health standards. Section 3 exempts from those
30 requirements certain employers who are engaged in: (1) law enforcement,
31 firefighting or otherwise responding to emergencies; (2) solid waste management or
32 the management of hazardous waste; or (3) towing services.
