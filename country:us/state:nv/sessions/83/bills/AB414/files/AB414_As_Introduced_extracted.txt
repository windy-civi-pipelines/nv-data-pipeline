SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to occupational safety

FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to occupational safety; revising the requirements
of written safety programs in certain workplaces to
include programs related to mitigation of heat illness and
certain air quality issues; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Division of Industrial Relations of the Department of
2 Business and Industry to provide for the establishment and supervision of programs
3 for the education and training of employers and employees on certain unsafe or
4 unhealthful working conditions. (NRS 618.353) Existing law requires certain
5 employers to establish a written safety program and implement the safety program
6 within 90 days after it is established. (NRS 618.383)
7 If an employer has employees who work at a large hybrid environment facility,
8 sections 3 and 5 of this bill require such a written safety program to include the
9 establishment of a program to mitigate occupational exposure to heat illness and
10 exposure to greenhouse gases, other gases or fumes and poor air quality. Section 2
11 of this bill defines the term “large hybrid environment facility” to mean, in general,
12 a facility where employees work: (1) that is at least 10,000 square feet; and (2) at
13 which workers are exposed to outdoor elements for a majority of each shift worked,
14 including, without limitation, through open loading docks or bay doors. Section 4
15 of this bill makes a conforming change so that the definition of “large hybrid
-
*AB414*
– 2 –
16 environment facility” applies to the provisions of existing law governing
17 occupational safety and health.
18 Section 3 requires a written safety plan relating to a large hybrid environment
19 facility to include provisions that require the establishment of: (1) systems for
20 monitoring employees for signs of heat illness; (2) procedures for responding to a
21 medical emergency related to heat illness; (3) a system to mitigate exposure to
22 certain air quality issues in accordance with occupational safety and health
23 standards; and (4) a system for monitoring employees for signs of health effects
24 resulting from exposure to certain air quality issues. Section 3 also requires such a
25 plan to contain provisions which: (1) require any vehicle which is loading or
26 unloading at the facility to have the engine of the vehicle turned off; (2) require a
27 designated person at the facility, not less than every 4 hours when employees are
28 working, to monitor and record the temperature and certain air quality information
29 in any area of the facility where employees are working; and (3) take certain
30 actions if the recorded temperature or air quality information exceeds 103 degrees
31 Fahrenheit or any relevant occupational safety and health standards.
