CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to occupational safety; revising the requirements
of written safety programs in certain workplaces to include
programs related to mitigation of certain air quality issues;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law requires the Division of Industrial Relations of the Department of
Business and Industry to provide for the establishment and supervision of programs
for the education and training of employers and employees on certain unsafe or
unhealthful working conditions. (NRS 618.353) Existing law requires certain
employers to establish a written safety program and implement the safety program
within 90 days after it is established. (NRS 618.383)
If an employer has more than 15 employees who work at a large hybrid
environment facility, sections 3 and 5 of this bill require, with certain exceptions,
such a written safety program to include the establishment of a program to mitigate
occupational exposure to greenhouse gases, other gases and poor air quality.

Section 2:
Section 2 of this bill defines the term “large hybrid environment facility” to mean,
in general, a facility where employees work: (1) that is at least 10,000 square feet;
and (2) at which workers are exposed to outdoor elements for a majority of each
shift worked, including, without limitation, through open loading docks or bay
doors. Section 4 of this bill makes a conforming change so that the definition of
“large hybrid environment facility” applies to the provisions of existing law
governing occupational safety and health.

Section 3:
Section 3 requires a written safety program relating to a large hybrid
environment facility to include provisions that require the establishment of: (1) a
system to mitigate exposure to certain air quality issues in accordance with
occupational safety and health standards; and (2) a system for monitoring
employees for signs of health effects resulting from exposure to certain air quality
issues. Section 3 also requires such a program to contain provisions which: (1)
require any vehicle which is loading or unloading at the facility to have the engine
of the vehicle turned off; (2) require a designated person at the facility, not less than
every 4 hours when employees are working, to monitor and record certain air
quality information in each area of the facility where employees are working; and
(3) take certain actions if the air quality information exceeds any relevant
occupational safety and health standards. Section 3 exempts from those
requirements state agencies and certain employers who are engaged in: (1) law
enforcement, firefighting or otherwise responding to emergencies; (2) solid waste
management or the management of hazardous waste; or (3) towing services.
