SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to voter registration.
(BDR 24-360)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
CONTAINS UNFUNDED MANDATE (§§ 1, 5)
(NOT REQUESTED BY AFFECTED LOCAL GOVERNMENT)
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to elections; requiring, under certain
circumstances, that a county or city clerk affirmatively
ask whether a registered voter would like to update his or
her signature in the voter registration records of the clerk;
providing, under certain circumstances, that any signature
provided by a voter to cure a mail ballot becomes the
voter’s signature for purposes of his or her voter
registration; requiring the Secretary of State, rather than
the county clerk, to send certain notices to persons who
register to vote or update their voter registration using the
automatic voter registration system; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires, with certain exceptions, that in order to vote a mail
2 ballot, a voter must affix his or her signature on the return envelope in the space
3 provided for the signature. (NRS 293.269917, 293C.26316) Existing law further
4 requires each county or city clerk, as applicable, to check the signature used for the
5 mail ballot. If there is a reasonable question of fact as to whether the signature used
6 for the mail ballot matches the signature of the voter in the records of the clerk, the
7 clerk is required to contact the voter. (NRS 293.269927, 293C.26327) Sections 1
8 and 5 of this bill provide that if the clerk contacts the voter, the clerk must, in
-
*AB261*
– 2 –
9 addition to other requirements, affirmatively ask whether the voter would like to
10 update his or her signature in the records of the clerk. Unless the voter affirmatively
11 declines to update his or her signature: (1) it shall be deemed that the voter
12 consented to update his or her signature; and (2) any signature provided by the
13 registered voter to the clerk becomes the voter’s signature for purposes of his or her
14 voter registration.
15 Existing law requires certain governmental agencies to provide services for
16 automatic voter registration. (NRS 293.5768, 293.57682, 293.57684) The Secretary
17 of State and each automatic voter registration agency are required to cooperatively
18 establish a system by which voter registration information that is collected by the
19 automatic voter registration agency is transmitted electronically to the centralized
20 database of voter registration information for purposes of registering a person to
21 vote or updating the voter registration information of a person. (NRS 293.57686,
22 293.57688) Upon transmission of the information to the database by an automatic
23 voter registration agency, existing law requires the county clerk to determine
24 whether a person is eligible to register to vote in this State. If the person is eligible
25 to vote, the county clerk must immediately mail a notice to the current residence
26 that includes certain information, including: (1) a space for the person to indicate a
27 political party affiliation; (2) a space for the person to affirmatively decline to apply
28 to register to vote or have his or her voter registration updated, as applicable; (3) a
29 statement setting forth the qualifications to vote in this State and that if the person
30 does not meet the qualifications to vote in this State, the person should return the
31 notice and affirmatively decline in writing to register to vote; (4) a statement
32 explaining that the person may affirmatively decline to register to vote or update his
33 or her voter registration information, as applicable; and (5) a statement setting forth
34 the penalties for submitting a false application to register to vote. (NRS 293.57693)
35 Section 4 of this bill instead requires the Secretary of State to send this notice.
36 Section 3 of this bill makes a conforming change to account for the requirement in
37 section 4 that the Secretary of State, rather than the county clerk, send this notice.
38 Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to eliminate the requirement that
39 the county clerk provide written notice of the addition or change to the voter
40 registration information of a voter on the statewide voter registration list as a result
41 of the process for automatic voter registration.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN

7 the county clerk, the county clerk shall, in addition to the
8 requirements set forth in NRS 293.269927, affirmatively ask
