Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes the Juvenile Justice Bill of Rights, which sets forth
2 certain rights of children who are detained in a detention facility in this State.
3 Existing law requires a detention facility in which a child is detained to: (1) inform
4 the child of the rights set forth in the Juvenile Justice Bill of Rights; (2) provide the
5 child and, to the extent practicable, the parent or guardian of the child, with a copy
6 of those rights; and (3) post a written copy of those rights in a conspicuous place
7 inside the detention facility. (NRS 62B.510, 62B.515) For the purposes of the
8 Juvenile Justice Bill of Rights, existing law defines “detention facility” to include a:
9 (1) local facility for the detention of children; and (2) state facility for the detention
10 of children. (NRS 62B.505) Section 1 of this bill expands the definition of
11 “detention facility” to include a regional facility for the treatment and rehabilitation
12 of children.
13 Existing law requires the juvenile court to make certain findings before
14 committing a child to the custody of a state facility for the detention of children.
15 (NRS 62E.505) Section 2 of this bill additionally requires the juvenile court to
16 make such findings before committing a child to the custody of a regional facility
17 for the treatment and rehabilitation of children.
