SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to tobacco.
(BDR 32-1098)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to tobacco; revising provisions governing the
taxation of cigarettes that consist of tobacco that is heated
but not burned; prohibiting such cigarettes from being
sold through the use of a cigarette vending machine;
providing a penalty; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law imposes an excise tax on the purchase or possession of cigarettes
2 at the rate of $1.80 cents per pack of 20 cigarettes. (NRS 370.165) Existing law
3 also imposes an excise tax on the receipt, purchase or sale of other tobacco
4 products, other than cigarettes, in this State. (NRS 370.450) For the purposes of
5 such taxes, a cigarette is defined as rolled tobacco, or tobacco substitute, that is
6 wrapped in paper or a substitute for paper that is not tobacco. (NRS 370.010)
7 Section 4 of this bill decreases the excise tax on cigarettes to $0.90 cents per
8 pack of 20 cigarettes if: (1) the cigarettes are intended to be heated but not burned
9 under ordinary conditions of use; (2) the United States Food and Drug
10 Administration has approved the product to be commercially marketed and
11 distributed in interstate commerce as a modified risk tobacco product; and (3) the
12 most recent postmarket surveillance and study conducted for the product in
13 accordance with federal law indicates that less than 5 percent of persons under the
14 age of 18 years have used the product. Section 1 of this bill provides that tobacco
15 that is rolled in paper and intended to be heated but not burned under ordinary
16 conditions of use is considered a cigarette for the purposes of licensing and taxation
17 in this State. Section 3 of this bill provides that such a cigarette, and any device
18 used to heat the tobacco in the cigarette is not a vapor product for the purposes of
19 licensing and taxation because such a product is licensed and taxed as a cigarette.
20 Existing federal regulations, with certain exceptions, require the sale of
21 cigarettes and smokeless tobacco to occur only in a direct, face-to-face exchange
22 without the assistance of any electronic or mechanical device, including, without
23 limitation, a vending machine. One exception to this requirement authorizes the use
-
*AB536*
– 2 –
24 of a vending machine or self-service display to sell cigarettes or smokeless tobacco
25 if the vending machine or self-service display is located in a facility where the
26 retailer ensures that no person younger than 21 years of age is present, or permitted
27 to enter, at any time. (21 C.F.R. § 1140.16)
28 Existing state law also prohibits a retailer from selling cigarettes through the
29 use of any type of display which is located in any area to which customers are
30 allowed access and from which cigarettes are readily accessible to a customer
31 without the assistance of the retailer. (NRS 202.2493) As an exception to this
32 requirement, existing state law authorizes the sale of cigarettes through a cigarette
33 vending machine placed in certain areas in which persons who are under 21 years
34 of age are prohibited from loitering. (NRS 202.2494) Existing law also provides for
35 the licensing of operators of cigarette vending machines and the payment of the
36 excise tax on cigarettes by the operators of cigarette vending machines. (NRS
37 370.270, 370.310, 370.380, 370.567, 370.575, 370.585) Section 9 of this bill
38 prohibits the sale through a cigarette vending machine of cigarettes that are
39 intended to be heated but not burned under ordinary conditions of use, and sections
40 2 and 5-7 of this bill make conforming changes to reflect that such types of
41 cigarettes are prohibited from being sold through cigarette vending machines.
42 Under existing law, a fine of not more than $500 applies to the unlawful sale of
43 cigarettes through a cigarette vending machine. (NRS 202.2493)

30 of its agents, and caused to be stamped by a licensed wholesale

SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to tobacco.
(BDR 32-1098)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to tobacco; revising provisions governing the
taxation of cigarettes that consist of tobacco that is heated
but not burned; prohibiting such cigarettes from being
sold through the use of a cigarette vending machine;
providing a penalty; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law imposes an excise tax on the purchase or possession of cigarettes
2 at the rate of $1.80 cents per pack of 20 cigarettes. (NRS 370.165) Existing law
3 also imposes an excise tax on the receipt, purchase or sale of other tobacco
4 products, other than cigarettes, in this State. (NRS 370.450) For the purposes of
5 such taxes, a cigarette is defined as rolled tobacco, or tobacco substitute, that is
6 wrapped in paper or a substitute for paper that is not tobacco. (NRS 370.010)
7 Section 4 of this bill decreases the excise tax on cigarettes to $0.90 cents per
8 pack of 20 cigarettes if: (1) the cigarettes are intended to be heated but not burned
9 under ordinary conditions of use; (2) the United States Food and Drug
10 Administration has approved the product to be commercially marketed and
11 distributed in interstate commerce as a modified risk tobacco product; and (3) the
12 most recent postmarket surveillance and study conducted for the product in
13 accordance with federal law indicates that less than 5 percent of persons under the
14 age of 18 years have used the product. Section 1 of this bill provides that tobacco
15 that is rolled in paper and intended to be heated but not burned under ordinary
16 conditions of use is considered a cigarette for the purposes of licensing and taxation
17 in this State. Section 3 of this bill provides that such a cigarette, and any device
18 used to heat the tobacco in the cigarette is not a vapor product for the purposes of
19 licensing and taxation because such a product is licensed and taxed as a cigarette.
20 Existing federal regulations, with certain exceptions, require the sale of
21 cigarettes and smokeless tobacco to occur only in a direct, face-to-face exchange
22 without the assistance of any electronic or mechanical device, including, without
23 limitation, a vending machine. One exception to this requirement authorizes the use
-

– 2 –
24 of a vending machine or self-service display to sell cigarettes or smokeless tobacco
25 if the vending machine or self-service display is located in a facility where the
26 retailer ensures that no person younger than 21 years of age is present, or permitted
27 to enter, at any time. (21 C.F.R. § 1140.16)
28 Existing state law also prohibits a retailer from selling cigarettes through the
29 use of any type of display which is located in any area to which customers are
30 allowed access and from which cigarettes are readily accessible to a customer
31 without the assistance of the retailer. (NRS 202.2493) As an exception to this
32 requirement, existing state law authorizes the sale of cigarettes through a cigarette
33 vending machine placed in certain areas in which persons who are under 21 years
34 of age are prohibited from loitering. (NRS 202.2494) Existing law also provides for
35 the licensing of operators of cigarette vending machines and the payment of the
36 excise tax on cigarettes by the operators of cigarette vending machines. (NRS
37 370.270, 370.310, 370.380, 370.567, 370.575, 370.585) Section 9 of this bill
38 prohibits the sale through a cigarette vending machine of cigarettes that are
39 intended to be heated but not burned under ordinary conditions of use, and sections
40 2 and 5-7 of this bill make conforming changes to reflect that such types of
41 cigarettes are prohibited from being sold through cigarette vending machines.
42 Under existing law, a fine of not more than $500 applies to the unlawful sale of
43 cigarettes through a cigarette vending machine. (NRS 202.2493)
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN

1 Section 1. NRS 370.010 is hereby amended to read as follows:

6 the tobacco is flavored, adulterated or mixed with any other
7 ingredient.

9 370.015 “Cigarette vending machine operator” means any

11 intended to be burned under ordinary conditions of use by means
12 of coin-operated machines anywhere in Nevada.
13 Sec. 3. NRS 370.054 is hereby amended to read as follows:
14 370.054 “Vapor product”:
15 1. Means any noncombustible product containing nicotine or
16 any other substance that employs a heating element, power source,
17 electronic circuit or other electronic, chemical or mechanical means,
