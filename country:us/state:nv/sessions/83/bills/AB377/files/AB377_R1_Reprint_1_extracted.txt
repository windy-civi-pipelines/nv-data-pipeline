EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to real property; requiring the Nevada Tax
Commission to include in the form prescribed for the
declaration of value of real property a section in which a
property owner is authorized to claim certain partial
abatements of property taxes; prescribing the manner in
which a property owner is required to claim such partial
abatements; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes partial abatements of property taxes for real property
2 that is: (1) a single-family residence which is the primary residence of the owner; or
3 (2) a residential rental dwelling that qualifies based on the amount of rent collected
4 from the tenants. (NRS 361.4723, 361.4724) Existing law requires a person who
5 files with a county recorder a deed evidencing a transfer of title of real property or a
6 land sale installment contract to also provide the county recorder with a declaration
7 of value of the real property made on a form prescribed by the Nevada Tax
8 Commission. The county recorder is prohibited from charging or collecting any fee
9 for recording the form. (NRS 375.060) Section 3 of this bill requires the Nevada
10 Tax Commission to include a section in that form in which a property owner is
11 authorized to claim a partial abatement of property taxes for a single-family
12 residence which is the primary residence of the owner or for a qualified residential
13 rental dwelling.

14 Existing regulations require an owner of a single-family residence which is the
15 primary residence of the owner to claim the partial abatement of property taxes on
16 the single-family residence by submitting a claim for the partial abatement to the
17 county assessor. (NAC 361.606) Section 1 of this bill additionally authorizes such
18 a partial abatement to be claimed on the form for a declaration of value prescribed
19 by the Nevada Tax Commission and provided to the county recorder with a deed
20 evidencing a transfer of title to the single-family residence.
21 Existing regulations require the owner of a residential rental dwelling that
22 qualifies for a certain partial abatement of property taxes based on the amount of
23 rent collected from the tenants of the property to claim the partial abatement by
24 annually filing a claim with the county assessor of the county in which the property
25 is located not later than June 15 of each year. Under existing regulations, the claim
26 must be accompanied by an affidavit concerning the amount of rent charged to the
27 tenants of the property. (NAC 361.607) Section 2 of this bill additionally
28 authorizes a claim for this partial abatement of property taxes to be made on a
29 declaration of value form prescribed by the Nevada Tax Commission and provided
30 to the county recorder with a deed evidencing the transfer of title to the property.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 361.4723 is hereby amended to read as
2 follows:
3 361.4723 The Legislature hereby finds and declares that an
4 increase in the tax bill of the owner of a home by more than 3
5 percent over the tax bill of that homeowner for the previous year
6 constitutes a severe economic hardship within the meaning of
7 subsection 10 of Section 1 of Article 10 of the Nevada Constitution.
8 The Legislature therefore directs a partial abatement of taxes for
9 such homeowners as follows:
10 1. Except as otherwise provided in or required to carry out the
11 provisions of subsection 2 and NRS 361.4725 to 361.4729,
12 inclusive, the owner of a single-family residence which is the
13 primary residence of the owner is entitled to a partial abatement of
14 the ad valorem taxes levied in a county on that property each fiscal
15 year equal to the amount by which the product of the combined rate
16 of all ad valorem taxes levied in that county on the property for that
17 fiscal year and the amount of the assessed valuation of the property
18 which is taxable in that county for that fiscal year, excluding any
19 increase in the assessed valuation of the property from the
20 immediately preceding fiscal year as a result of any improvement to
21 or change in the actual or authorized use of the property, exceeds the
22 sum obtained by adding:
23 (a) The amount of all the ad valorem taxes:
24 (1) Levied in that county on the property for the immediately
25 preceding fiscal year; or
-
*AB377_R1*
– 3 –
1 (2) Which would have been levied in that county on the
2 property for the immediately preceding fiscal year if not for any
3 exemptions from taxation that applied to the property for that prior
4 fiscal year but do not apply to the property for the current fiscal
5 year,
6  whichever is greater; and
7 (b) Three percent of the amount determined pursuant to
8 paragraph (a).
9 2. The provisions of subsection 1 do not apply to any property
10 for which:
11 (a) No assessed valuation was separately established for the
12 immediately preceding fiscal year; or
13 (b) The provisions of subsection 1 of NRS 361.4722 provide a
14 greater abatement from taxation.
15 3. Except as otherwise required to carry out the provisions of
16 NRS 361.4732 and any regulations adopted pursuant to NRS
17 361.4733, the amount of any reduction in the ad valorem taxes
18 levied in a county for a fiscal year as a result of the application of
19 the provisions of subsection 1 must be deducted from the amount of
20 ad valorem taxes each taxing entity would otherwise be entitled to
21 receive for that fiscal year in the same proportion as the rate of ad
22 valorem taxes levied in the county on the property by or on behalf of
23 that taxing entity for that fiscal year bears to the combined rate of all
24 ad valorem taxes levied in the county on the property by or on
25 behalf of all taxing entities for that fiscal year.
26 4. The Nevada Tax Commission shall adopt such regulations as
27 it deems appropriate to carry out this section, including, without
28 limitation, regulations providing a methodology for applying the
29 partial abatement provided pursuant to subsection 1 to a parcel of
30 real property of which only a portion qualifies as a single-family
31 residence which is the primary residence of the owner and the
32 remainder is used in another manner.
33 5. The owner of a single-family residence does not become
34 ineligible for the partial abatement provided pursuant to subsection
35 1 as a result of:
36 (a) The operation of a home business out of a portion of that
37 single-family residence; or
38 (b) The manner in which title is held by the owner if the owner
39 occupies the residence, including, without limitation, if the owner
40 has placed the title in a trust for purposes of estate planning.
41 6. A claim for a partial abatement of property taxes pursuant
42 to this section must be submitted:
43 (a) On a form provided by the county assessor of the county in
44 which the property is located in accordance with regulations
45 adopted by the Nevada Tax Commission; or
-
*AB377_R1*
– 4 –
1 (b) If a partial abatement of property taxes pursuant to this
2 section is claimed on the form for a declaration of value
3 prescribed by the Nevada Tax Commission pursuant to NRS
4 375.060, on the form prescribed by the Nevada Tax Commission
5 pursuant to NRS 375.060.
6 7. For the purposes of this section:
7 (a) “Primary residence of the owner” means a residence which:
8 (1) Is designated by the owner as the primary residence of
9 the owner in this State, exclusive of any other residence of the
10 owner in this State; and
11 (2) Is not rented, leased or otherwise made available for
12 exclusive occupancy by any person other than the owner of the
13 residence and members of the family of the owner of the residence.
14 (b) “Single-family residence” means a parcel or other unit of
15 real property or unit of personal property which is intended or

18 (c) “Unit of personal property” includes, without limitation, any:
19 (1) Mobile or manufactured home, whether or not the owner
20 thereof also owns the real property upon which it is located; or
21 (2) Taxable unit of a condominium, common-interest
22 community, planned unit development or similar property,
23  if classified as personal property for the purposes of this chapter.
24 (d) “Unit of real property” includes, without limitation, any
25 taxable unit of a condominium, common-interest community,
26 planned unit development or similar property, if classified as real
27 property for the purposes of this chapter.
28 Sec. 2. NRS 361.4724 is hereby amended to read as follows:
29 361.4724 The Legislature hereby finds and declares that many
30 Nevadans who cannot afford to own their own homes would be
31 adversely affected by large unanticipated increases in property
32 taxes, as those tax increases are passed down to renters in the form
33 of rent increases and therefore the benefits of a charitable exemption
34 pursuant to subsection 8 of Section 1 of Article 10 of the Nevada
35 Constitution should be afforded to those Nevadans through an
36 abatement granted to the owners of residential rental dwellings who
37 charge rent that does not exceed affordable housing standards for
38 low-income housing. The Legislature therefore directs a partial
39 abatement of taxes for such owners as follows:
40 1. Except as otherwise provided in or required to carry out the
41 provisions of subsection 2 and NRS 361.4725 to 361.4729,
42 inclusive, if the amount of rent collected from each of the tenants of
43 a residential dwelling does not exceed the fair market rent for the
44 county in which the dwelling is located, as most recently published
45 by the United States Department of Housing and Urban
-
*AB377_R1*
– 5 –
1 Development, the owner of the dwelling is entitled to a partial
2 abatement of the ad valorem taxes levied in a county on that
3 property for each fiscal year equal to the amount by which the
4 product of the combined rate of all ad valorem taxes levied in that
5 county on the property for that fiscal year and the amount of the
6 assessed valuation of the property which is taxable in that county for
7 that fiscal year, excluding any increase in the assessed valuation of
8 the property from the immediately preceding fiscal year as a result
9 of any improvement to or change in the actual or authorized use of
10 the property, exceeds the sum obtained by adding:
11 (a) The amount of all the ad valorem taxes:
12 (1) Levied in that county on the property for the immediately
13 preceding fiscal year; or
14 (2) Which would have been levied in that county on the
15 property for the immediately preceding fiscal year if not for any
16 exemptions from taxation that applied to the property for that prior
17 fiscal year but do not apply to the property for the current fiscal
18 year,
19  whichever is greater; and
20 (b) Three percent of the amount determined pursuant to
21 paragraph (a).
22 2. The provisions of subsection 1 do not apply to:
23 (a) Any hotels, motels or other forms of transient lodging;
24 (b) Any property for which no assessed valuation was separately
25 established for the immediately preceding fiscal year; and
26 (c) Any property for which the provisions of subsection 1 of
27 NRS 361.4722 provide a greater abatement from taxation.
28 3. Except as otherwise required to carry out the provisions of
29 NRS 361.4732 and any regulations adopted pursuant to NRS
30 361.4733, the amount of any reduction in the ad valorem taxes
31 levied in a county for a fiscal year as a result of the application of
32 the provisions of subsection 1 must be deducted from the amount of
33 ad valorem taxes each taxing entity would otherwise be entitled to
34 receive for that fiscal year in the same proportion as the rate of ad
35 valorem taxes levied in the county on the property by or on behalf of
36 that taxing entity for that fiscal year bears to the combined rate of all
37 ad valorem taxes levied in the county on the property by or on
38 behalf of all taxing entities for that fiscal year.
39 4. A claim for a partial abatement of property taxes pursuant
40 to this section must be submitted:
41 (a) In the manner prescribed by regulations adopted by the
42 Nevada Tax Commission; or
43 (b) If a partial abatement of property taxes pursuant to this
44 section is claimed on the form for a declaration of value
45 prescribed by the Nevada Tax Commission pursuant to
-
*AB377_R1*
– 6 –
1 NRS 375.060, on the form prescribed by the Nevada Tax
2 Commission pursuant to NRS 375.060.
3 5. The Nevada Tax Commission shall adopt such regulations as
4 it deems appropriate to carry out this section.
5 Sec. 3. NRS 375.060 is hereby amended to read as follows:
6 375.060 1. Each deed evidencing a transfer of title of real
7 property or land sale installment contract that is presented for
8 recordation to the county recorder must be accompanied by a
9 declaration of value made on a form prescribed by the Nevada Tax
10 Commission.
11 2. The Nevada Tax Commission shall include in the form
12 prescribed pursuant to subsection 1 a section in which the
13 property owner may claim a partial abatement from taxation
14 provided pursuant to NRS 361.4723 or 361.4724.
15 3. A county recorder shall not charge or collect any fees for
16 recording the declaration of value required pursuant to this section.
17 Sec. 4. 1. This section becomes effective upon passage and
18 approval.
19 2. Sections 1, 2 and 3 of this act become effective:
20 (a) Upon passage and approval for the purpose of adopting any

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to real property; requiring the Nevada Tax
Commission to include in the form prescribed for the
declaration of value of real property a section in which a
property owner is authorized to claim certain partial
abatements of property taxes; prescribing the manner in
which a property owner is required to claim such partial
abatements; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes partial abatements of property taxes for real property
2 that is: (1) a single-family residence which is the primary residence of the owner; or
3 (2) a residential rental dwelling that qualifies based on the amount of rent collected
4 from the tenants. (NRS 361.4723, 361.4724) Existing law requires a person who
5 files with a county recorder a deed evidencing a transfer of title of real property or a
6 land sale installment contract to also provide the county recorder with a declaration
7 of value of the real property made on a form prescribed by the Nevada Tax
8 Commission. The county recorder is prohibited from charging or collecting any fee
9 for recording the form. (NRS 375.060) Section 3 of this bill requires the Nevada
10 Tax Commission to include a section in that form in which a property owner is
11 authorized to claim a partial abatement of property taxes for a single-family
12 residence which is the primary residence of the owner or for a qualified residential
13 rental dwelling.

14 Existing regulations require an owner of a single-family residence which is the
15 primary residence of the owner to claim the partial abatement of property taxes on
16 the single-family residence by submitting a claim for the partial abatement to the
17 county assessor. (NAC 361.606) Section 1 of this bill additionally authorizes such
18 a partial abatement to be claimed on the form for a declaration of value prescribed
19 by the Nevada Tax Commission and provided to the county recorder with a deed
20 evidencing a transfer of title to the single-family residence.
21 Existing regulations require the owner of a residential rental dwelling that
22 qualifies for a certain partial abatement of property taxes based on the amount of
23 rent collected from the tenants of the property to claim the partial abatement by
24 annually filing a claim with the county assessor of the county in which the property
25 is located not later than June 15 of each year. Under existing regulations, the claim
26 must be accompanied by an affidavit concerning the amount of rent charged to the
27 tenants of the property. (NAC 361.607) Section 2 of this bill additionally
28 authorizes a claim for this partial abatement of property taxes to be made on a
29 declaration of value form prescribed by the Nevada Tax Commission and provided
30 to the county recorder with a deed evidencing the transfer of title to the property.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 361.4723 is hereby amended to read as
2 follows:
3 361.4723 The Legislature hereby finds and declares that an
4 increase in the tax bill of the owner of a home by more than 3
5 percent over the tax bill of that homeowner for the previous year
6 constitutes a severe economic hardship within the meaning of
7 subsection 10 of Section 1 of Article 10 of the Nevada Constitution.
8 The Legislature therefore directs a partial abatement of taxes for
9 such homeowners as follows:
10 1. Except as otherwise provided in or required to carry out the
11 provisions of subsection 2 and NRS 361.4725 to 361.4729,
12 inclusive, the owner of a single-family residence which is the
13 primary residence of the owner is entitled to a partial abatement of
14 the ad valorem taxes levied in a county on that property each fiscal
15 year equal to the amount by which the product of the combined rate
16 of all ad valorem taxes levied in that county on the property for that
17 fiscal year and the amount of the assessed valuation of the property
18 which is taxable in that county for that fiscal year, excluding any
19 increase in the assessed valuation of the property from the
20 immediately preceding fiscal year as a result of any improvement to
21 or change in the actual or authorized use of the property, exceeds the
22 sum obtained by adding:
23 (a) The amount of all the ad valorem taxes:
24 (1) Levied in that county on the property for the immediately
25 preceding fiscal year; or
-
*AB377_R1*

– 3 –
1 (2) Which would have been levied in that county on the
2 property for the immediately preceding fiscal year if not for any
3 exemptions from taxation that applied to the property for that prior
4 fiscal year but do not apply to the property for the current fiscal
5 year,
6  whichever is greater; and
7 (b) Three percent of the amount determined pursuant to
8 paragraph (a).
9 2. The provisions of subsection 1 do not apply to any property
10 for which:
11 (a) No assessed valuation was separately established for the
12 immediately preceding fiscal year; or
13 (b) The provisions of subsection 1 of NRS 361.4722 provide a
14 greater abatement from taxation.
15 3. Except as otherwise required to carry out the provisions of
16 NRS 361.4732 and any regulations adopted pursuant to NRS
17 361.4733, the amount of any reduction in the ad valorem taxes
18 levied in a county for a fiscal year as a result of the application of
19 the provisions of subsection 1 must be deducted from the amount of
20 ad valorem taxes each taxing entity would otherwise be entitled to
21 receive for that fiscal year in the same proportion as the rate of ad
22 valorem taxes levied in the county on the property by or on behalf of
23 that taxing entity for that fiscal year bears to the combined rate of all
24 ad valorem taxes levied in the county on the property by or on
25 behalf of all taxing entities for that fiscal year.
26 4. The Nevada Tax Commission shall adopt such regulations as
27 it deems appropriate to carry out this section, including, without
28 limitation, regulations providing a methodology for applying the
29 partial abatement provided pursuant to subsection 1 to a parcel of
30 real property of which only a portion qualifies as a single-family
31 residence which is the primary residence of the owner and the
32 remainder is used in another manner.
33 5. The owner of a single-family residence does not become
34 ineligible for the partial abatement provided pursuant to subsection
35 1 as a result of:
36 (a) The operation of a home business out of a portion of that
37 single-family residence; or
38 (b) The manner in which title is held by the owner if the owner
39 occupies the residence, including, without limitation, if the owner
40 has placed the title in a trust for purposes of estate planning.
41 6. A claim for a partial abatement of property taxes pursuant
42 to this section must be submitted:
43 (a) On a form provided by the county assessor of the county in
44 which the property is located in accordance with regulations
45 adopted by the Nevada Tax Commission; or
-
*AB377_R1*

– 4 –
1 (b) If a partial abatement of property taxes pursuant to this
2 section is claimed on the form for a declaration of value
3 prescribed by the Nevada Tax Commission pursuant to NRS
4 375.060, on the form prescribed by the Nevada Tax Commission
5 pursuant to NRS 375.060.
6 7. For the purposes of this section:
7 (a) “Primary residence of the owner” means a residence which:
8 (1) Is designated by the owner as the primary residence of
9 the owner in this State, exclusive of any other residence of the
10 owner in this State; and
11 (2) Is not rented, leased or otherwise made available for
12 exclusive occupancy by any person other than the owner of the
13 residence and members of the family of the owner of the residence.
14 (b) “Single-family residence” means a parcel or other unit of
15 real property or unit of personal property which is intended or
16 designed to be occupied by one family with facilities for living,
17 sleeping, cooking and eating.
18 (c) “Unit of personal property” includes, without limitation, any:
19 (1) Mobile or manufactured home, whether or not the owner
20 thereof also owns the real property upon which it is located; or
21 (2) Taxable unit of a condominium, common-interest
22 community, planned unit development or similar property,
23  if classified as personal property for the purposes of this chapter.
24 (d) “Unit of real property” includes, without limitation, any
25 taxable unit of a condominium, common-interest community,
26 planned unit development or similar property, if classified as real
27 property for the purposes of this chapter.
28 Sec. 2. NRS 361.4724 is hereby amended to read as follows:
29 361.4724 The Legislature hereby finds and declares that many
30 Nevadans who cannot afford to own their own homes would be
31 adversely affected by large unanticipated increases in property
32 taxes, as those tax increases are passed down to renters in the form
33 of rent increases and therefore the benefits of a charitable exemption
34 pursuant to subsection 8 of Section 1 of Article 10 of the Nevada
35 Constitution should be afforded to those Nevadans through an
36 abatement granted to the owners of residential rental dwellings who
37 charge rent that does not exceed affordable housing standards for
38 low-income housing. The Legislature therefore directs a partial
39 abatement of taxes for such owners as follows:
40 1. Except as otherwise provided in or required to carry out the
41 provisions of subsection 2 and NRS 361.4725 to 361.4729,
42 inclusive, if the amount of rent collected from each of the tenants of
43 a residential dwelling does not exceed the fair market rent for the
44 county in which the dwelling is located, as most recently published
45 by the United States Department of Housing and Urban
-
*AB377_R1*

– 5 –
1 Development, the owner of the dwelling is entitled to a partial
2 abatement of the ad valorem taxes levied in a county on that
3 property for each fiscal year equal to the amount by which the
4 product of the combined rate of all ad valorem taxes levied in that
5 county on the property for that fiscal year and the amount of the

7 that fiscal year, excluding any increase in the assessed valuation of
