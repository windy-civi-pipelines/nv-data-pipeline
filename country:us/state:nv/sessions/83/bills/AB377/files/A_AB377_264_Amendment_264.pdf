AN ACT relating to real property; requiring the Nevada Tax Commission to
include in the form prescribed for the declaration of value of real
property a section in which a property owner is authorized to claim
certain partial abatements of property taxes; prescribing the manner
in which a property owner is required to claim such partial
abatements; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes partial abatements of property taxes for real property that is: (1) a
2 single-family residence which is the primary residence of the owner; or (2) a residential rental
3 dwelling that qualifies based on the amount of rent collected from the tenants. (NRS
4 361.4723, 361.4724) Existing law requires a person who files with a county recorder a deed
5 evidencing a transfer of title of real property or a land sale installment contract to also provide
6 the county recorder with a declaration of value of the real property made on a form prescribed
7 by the Nevada Tax Commission. The county recorder is prohibited from charging or
8 collecting any fee for recording the form. (NRS 375.060) [This] Section 3 of this bill requires
9 the Nevada Tax Commission to include a section in that form in which a property owner is
10 authorized to claim a partial abatement of property taxes for a single-family residence which
11 is the primary residence of the owner or for a qualified residential rental dwelling.
12 Existing regulations require an owner of a single-family residence which is the
13 primary residence of the owner to claim the partial abatement of property taxes on the
14 single-family residence by submitting a claim for the partial abatement to the county
15 assessor. (NAC 361.606) Section 1 of this bill additionally authorizes such a partial
16 abatement to be claimed on the form for a declaration of value prescribed by the Nevada
17 Tax Commission and provided to the county recorder with a deed evidencing a transfer
18 of title to the single-family residence.
19 Existing regulations require the owner of a residential rental dwelling that qualifies
20 for a certain partial abatement of property taxes based on the amount of rent collected
21 from the tenants of the property to claim the partial abatement by annually filing a
22 claim with the county assessor of the county in which the property is located not later
23 than June 15 of each year. Under existing regulations, the claim must be accompanied
24 by an affidavit concerning the amount of rent charged to the tenants of the property.

Assembly Amendment No. 264 to Assembly Bill No. 377 Page 4
25 (NAC 361.607) Section 2 of this bill additionally authorizes a claim for this partial
26 abatement of property taxes to be made on a declaration of value form prescribed by the
27 Nevada Tax Commission and provided to the county recorder with a deed evidencing
28 the transfer of title to the property.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
1 Section 1. NRS 361.4723 is hereby amended to read as follows:
2 361.4723 The Legislature hereby finds and declares that an increase in the tax
3 bill of the owner of a home by more than 3 percent over the tax bill of that
4 homeowner for the previous year constitutes a severe economic hardship within the
5 meaning of subsection 10 of Section 1 of Article 10 of the Nevada Constitution.
6 The Legislature therefore directs a partial abatement of taxes for such homeowners
7 as follows:
8 1. Except as otherwise provided in or required to carry out the provisions of
9 subsection 2 and NRS 361.4725 to 361.4729, inclusive, the owner of a single-
10 family residence which is the primary residence of the owner is entitled to a partial
11 abatement of the ad valorem taxes levied in a county on that property each fiscal
12 year equal to the amount by which the product of the combined rate of all ad
13 valorem taxes levied in that county on the property for that fiscal year and the
14 amount of the assessed valuation of the property which is taxable in that county for
15 that fiscal year, excluding any increase in the assessed valuation of the property
16 from the immediately preceding fiscal year as a result of any improvement to or
17 change in the actual or authorized use of the property, exceeds the sum obtained by
18 adding:
19 (a) The amount of all the ad valorem taxes:
20 (1) Levied in that county on the property for the immediately preceding
21 fiscal year; or
22 (2) Which would have been levied in that county on the property for the
23 immediately preceding fiscal year if not for any exemptions from taxation that
24 applied to the property for that prior fiscal year but do not apply to the property for
25 the current fiscal year,
26  whichever is greater; and
27 (b) Three percent of the amount determined pursuant to paragraph (a).
28 2. The provisions of subsection 1 do not apply to any property for which:
29 (a) No assessed valuation was separately established for the immediately
30 preceding fiscal year; or
31 (b) The provisions of subsection 1 of NRS 361.4722 provide a greater
32 abatement from taxation.
33 3. Except as otherwise required to carry out the provisions of NRS 361.4732
34 and any regulations adopted pursuant to NRS 361.4733, the amount of any
35 reduction in the ad valorem taxes levied in a county for a fiscal year as a result of
36 the application of the provisions of subsection 1 must be deducted from the amount
37 of ad valorem taxes each taxing entity would otherwise be entitled to receive for
38 that fiscal year in the same proportion as the rate of ad valorem taxes levied in the
39 county on the property by or on behalf of that taxing entity for that fiscal year bears
40 to the combined rate of all ad valorem taxes levied in the county on the property by
41 or on behalf of all taxing entities for that fiscal year.
42 4. The Nevada Tax Commission shall adopt such regulations as it deems
43 appropriate to carry out this section, including, without limitation, regulations

Assembly Amendment No. 264 to Assembly Bill No. 377 Page 5
1 providing a methodology for applying the partial abatement provided pursuant to
2 subsection 1 to a parcel of real property of which only a portion qualifies as a
3 single-family residence which is the primary residence of the owner and the
4 remainder is used in another manner.
5 5. The owner of a single-family residence does not become ineligible for the
6 partial abatement provided pursuant to subsection 1 as a result of:
7 (a) The operation of a home business out of a portion of that single-family
8 residence; or
9 (b) The manner in which title is held by the owner if the owner occupies the
10 residence, including, without limitation, if the owner has placed the title in a trust
11 for purposes of estate planning.
12 6. A claim for a partial abatement of property taxes pursuant to this section
13 must be submitted:
14 (a) On a form provided by the county assessor of the county in which the
15 property is located in accordance with regulations adopted by the Nevada Tax
16 Commission; or
17 (b) If a partial abatement of property taxes pursuant to this section is claimed
18 on the form for a declaration of value prescribed by the Nevada Tax Commission
19 pursuant to NRS 375.060, on the form prescribed by the Nevada Tax Commission
20 pursuant to NRS 375.060.
21 7. For the purposes of this section:
22 (a) “Primary residence of the owner” means a residence which:
23 (1) Is designated by the owner as the primary residence of the owner in this
24 State, exclusive of any other residence of the owner in this State; and
25 (2) Is not rented, leased or otherwise made available for exclusive
26 occupancy by any person other than the owner of the residence and members of the
27 family of the owner of the residence.
28 (b) “Single-family residence” means a parcel or other unit of real property or
29 unit of personal property which is intended or designed to be occupied by one
30 family with facilities for living, sleeping, cooking and eating.
31 (c) “Unit of personal property” includes, without limitation, any:
32 (1) Mobile or manufactured home, whether or not the owner thereof also
33 owns the real property upon which it is located; or
34 (2) Taxable unit of a condominium, common-interest community, planned
35 unit development or similar property,
36  if classified as personal property for the purposes of this chapter.
37 (d) “Unit of real property” includes, without limitation, any taxable unit of a
38 condominium, common-interest community, planned unit development or similar
39 property, if classified as real property for the purposes of this chapter.
40 Sec. 2. NRS 361.4724 is hereby amended to read as follows:
41 361.4724 The Legislature hereby finds and declares that many Nevadans who
42 cannot afford to own their own homes would be adversely affected by large
43 unanticipated increases in property taxes, as those tax increases are passed down to
44 renters in the form of rent increases and therefore the benefits of a charitable
45 exemption pursuant to subsection 8 of Section 1 of Article 10 of the Nevada
46 Constitution should be afforded to those Nevadans through an abatement granted to
47 the owners of residential rental dwellings who charge rent that does not exceed
48 affordable housing standards for low-income housing. The Legislature therefore
49 directs a partial abatement of taxes for such owners as follows:
50 1. Except as otherwise provided in or required to carry out the provisions of
51 subsection 2 and NRS 361.4725 to 361.4729, inclusive, if the amount of rent
52 collected from each of the tenants of a residential dwelling does not exceed the fair
53 market rent for the county in which the dwelling is located, as most recently

Assembly Amendment No. 264 to Assembly Bill No. 377 Page 6
1 published by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development,
2 the owner of the dwelling is entitled to a partial abatement of the ad valorem taxes
3 levied in a county on that property for each fiscal year equal to the amount by
4 which the product of the combined rate of all ad valorem taxes levied in that county
5 on the property for that fiscal year and the amount of the assessed valuation of the
6 property which is taxable in that county for that fiscal year, excluding any increase
7 in the assessed valuation of the property from the immediately preceding fiscal year
8 as a result of any improvement to or change in the actual or authorized use of the
9 property, exceeds the sum obtained by adding:
10 (a) The amount of all the ad valorem taxes:
11 (1) Levied in that county on the property for the immediately preceding
12 fiscal year; or
13 (2) Which would have been levied in that county on the property for the
14 immediately preceding fiscal year if not for any exemptions from taxation that
15 applied to the property for that prior fiscal year but do not apply to the property for
16 the current fiscal year,
17  whichever is greater; and
18 (b) Three percent of the amount determined pursuant to paragraph (a).
19 2. The provisions of subsection 1 do not apply to:
20 (a) Any hotels, motels or other forms of transient lodging;
21 (b) Any property for which no assessed valuation was separately established
22 for the immediately preceding fiscal year; and
23 (c) Any property for which the provisions of subsection 1 of NRS 361.4722
24 provide a greater abatement from taxation.
25 3. Except as otherwise required to carry out the provisions of NRS 361.4732
26 and any regulations adopted pursuant to NRS 361.4733, the amount of any
27 reduction in the ad valorem taxes levied in a county for a fiscal year as a result of
28 the application of the provisions of subsection 1 must be deducted from the amount
29 of ad valorem taxes each taxing entity would otherwise be entitled to receive for
30 that fiscal year in the same proportion as the rate of ad valorem taxes levied in the
31 county on the property by or on behalf of that taxing entity for that fiscal year bears
32 to the combined rate of all ad valorem taxes levied in the county on the property by
33 or on behalf of all taxing entities for that fiscal year.
34 4. A claim for a partial abatement of property taxes pursuant to this section
35 must be submitted:
36 (a) In the manner prescribed by regulations adopted by the Nevada Tax
37 Commission; or
38 (b) If a partial abatement of property taxes pursuant to this section is claimed
39 on the form for a declaration of value prescribed by the Nevada Tax Commission
40 pursuant to NRS 375.060, on the form prescribed by the Nevada Tax Commission
41 pursuant to NRS 375.060.
42 5. The Nevada Tax Commission shall adopt such regulations as it deems
43 appropriate to carry out this section.
44 [Section 1.] Sec. 3. NRS 375.060 is hereby amended to read as follows:
45 375.060 1. Each deed evidencing a transfer of title of real property or land
46 sale installment contract that is presented for recordation to the county recorder
47 must be accompanied by a declaration of value made on a form prescribed by the
48 Nevada Tax Commission.
49 2. The Nevada Tax Commission shall include in the form prescribed
50 pursuant to subsection 1 a section in which the property owner may claim a
51 partial abatement from taxation provided pursuant to NRS 361.4723 or 361.4724.
52 3. A county recorder shall not charge or collect any fees for recording the
53 declaration of value required pursuant to this section.
