AN ACT relating to real property; requiring the Nevada Tax
Commission to include in the form prescribed for the
declaration of value of real property a section in which a
property owner is authorized to claim certain partial
abatements of property taxes; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law establishes partial abatements of property taxes for real property
2 that is: (1) a single-family residence which is the primary residence of the owner; or
3 (2) a residential rental dwelling that qualifies based on the amount of rent collected
4 from the tenants. (NRS 361.4723, 361.4724) Existing law requires a person who
5 files with a county recorder a deed evidencing a transfer of title of real property or a
6 land sale installment contract to also provide the county recorder with a declaration
7 of value of the real property made on a form prescribed by the Nevada Tax
8 Commission. The county recorder is prohibited from charging or collecting any fee
9 for recording the form. (NRS 375.060) This bill requires the Nevada Tax
10 Commission to include a section in that form in which a property owner is
11 authorized to claim a partial abatement of property taxes for a single-family
12 residence which is the primary residence of the owner or for a qualified residential
13 rental dwelling.
