EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to the Legislature; reducing, with certain
exceptions, the number of legislative measures that are
authorized to be requested or required to be prefiled for a
regular legislative session; codifying into statute, with
certain exceptions, certain provisions of the Joint
Standing Rules of the Senate and Assembly that authorize
requests for legislative measures; eliminating the
authority of a caucus leader to allocate the legislative
measures requested by a Legislator whose office becomes
vacant during a certain period; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Under existing law, committees, Legislators and other persons and entities are
2 authorized to request the drafting of legislative measures for consideration during a
3 regular legislative session. Existing law also establishes: (1) the maximum number
4 of measures that those persons and entities are authorized to request; and (2) the
5 minimum number of legislative measures that Legislators are required to prefile.
6 (NRS 218D.150-218D.220, 219A.220) Sections 1-8 of this bill reduce the
7 maximum number of requests for the drafting of legislative measures that are
8 authorized to be made by requesters, unless the maximum number of requests
9 authorized in existing law is 2 or less. Sections 1 and 2 clarify that the requests are
10 required to be submitted to the Legislative Counsel. Section 1 also reduces the
11 number of legislative measures that are required to be prefiled by Legislators,
12 unless the minimum number of requests required to be prefiled in existing law is 2
13 or less.
14 In addition to the requests currently authorized in the Nevada Revised Statutes,
15 existing joint standing rules authorize each House, from the first day of a regular
16 session until 5 p.m. on the 15th calendar day of the regular session, to submit a
-
*SB109*

– 2 –
17 maximum of 60 requests for the drafting of a bill or joint resolution. The Majority
18 Leader of the Senate and the Speaker of the Assembly are required to allocate all,
19 some or none of these authorized requests and provide the Legislative Counsel with
20 a written list of the number of requests that are authorized to be submitted by each
21 member and standing committee of their respective Houses, and by the Majority
22 Leader and Speaker. (Joint Standing Rule No. 14 of the Joint Standing Rules of the
23 Senate and Assembly for the 83rd Legislative Session) Section 1 codifies these
24 provisions into statute, but reduces from 60 to 40, for each House, the maximum
25 number of such requests that are authorized to be submitted.
26 Existing joint standing rules provide that, after a legislative session has
27 convened, the Majority Leader of the Senate and the Speaker of the Assembly are
28 authorized to each submit, on his or her own behalf or on the behalf of another
29 Legislator or standing committee of the Senate or Assembly, respectively, a
30 maximum of 10 requests for the drafting of a bill or resolution, which are required
31 to be designated as emergency measures. (Joint Standing Rule No. 14.4 of the Joint
32 Standing Rules of the Senate and Assembly for the 83rd Legislative Session)
33 Section 2 codifies into statute: (1) this authority to submit requests, but reduces the
34 maximum number of such requests that the Majority Leader and Speaker are each
35 authorized to submit from 10 to 7; and (2) the requirement that those measures be
36 designated as emergency measures.
37 Existing joint standing rules provide that, after a legislative session has
38 convened, the Minority Leader of the Senate and the Minority Leader of the
39 Assembly are authorized to each submit, on his or her own behalf or on the behalf
40 of another Legislator or standing committee of the Senate or Assembly,
41 respectively, a maximum of 3 requests for the drafting of a bill or resolution, which
42 are required to be designated as emergency measures. (Joint Standing Rule No.
43 14.4 of the Joint Standing Rules of the Senate and Assembly for the 83rd
44 Legislative Session) Section 2 codifies into statute: (1) this authority to submit
45 requests, but reduces the maximum number of such requests that each Minority
46 Leader is authorized to submit from 3 to 2; and (2) the requirement that those
47 measures be designated as emergency measures.
48 If a vacancy occurs in the office of a Legislator after the general election and
49 before the regular session of the Legislature is convened, existing law authorizes
50 the caucus leader of the house and party of which the Legislator was a member to
51 allocate all, some or none of the requests for the drafting of legislative measures
52 requested or available to be requested by the Legislator. (NRS 218D.152) Section 9
53 of this bill repeals this authority.
