Assembly Bill No. 286–Assemblymembers
Torres-Fossett and González
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to education; authorizing one or more institutions
of higher education within the Nevada System of Higher
Education to establish a pilot program to assess the
competency of applicants for a license to teach through the
use of alternative assessment methods; requiring certain
regulations adopted by the Commission on Professional
Standards in Education to authorize an applicant for a license
to teach to be exempt from requirements to pass a
competency test in various subjects if the applicant completes
the pilot program; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law creates the Commission on Professional Standards in Education
and requires the Commission to adopt regulations prescribing the qualifications for
licensing teachers and other educational personnel. (NRS 391.011, 391.019)
Existing law additionally requires the Commission to adopt regulations governing
examinations for the initial licensing of teachers and other educational personnel.
(NRS 391.021) Existing regulations provide that an applicant is exempt from the
requirement to pass a competency test in the principles and methods of teaching if
the applicant submits to the Department of Education evidence that he or she: (1)
completed the “Principles of Learning and Teaching Test” prepared and
administered by the Educational Testing Service; or (2) is applying for a license
with an endorsement in an area for which training in the principles and methods of
teaching is not required. (NAC 391.036) Section 1 of this bill provides that the
regulations adopted by the Commission must also authorize an applicant for an
initial license to teach to be exempt from the requirement to pass a competency test
in the principles and methods of teaching if he or she satisfactorily completes the
pilot program established pursuant to section 2 of this bill.
Section 2 authorizes institutions within the Nevada System of Higher
Education to establish a pilot program to offer an alternative pathway for assessing
the competency of prospective teachers through the use of alternative assessment
methods. Section 2: (1) sets forth the requirements for the program; and (2)
provides that the pilot program must select not more than 100 participants each
academic year during the duration of the program; and (3) requires that each
participant be an applicant for an initial license to teach who currently holds a
provisional license to teach or an endorsement or license to serve as a substitute
teacher.
For a participant in the pilot program, section 2 requires the Department to
extend the deadline for successfully passing a competency test, which is required to
receive an initial license to teach, for a period of 24 months after he or she is
selected to participate in the program, thereby allowing the participant to use his or
her satisfactory completion of the pilot program to satisfy by exemption the
requirement to complete certain competency tests. Section 2 also requires each
institution that established a pilot program to submit: (1) an annual progress report
regarding the pilot program to the Commission, the State Board of Education and
the Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau for distribution to the Joint Interim
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 2 –
Standing Committee on Education; and (2) not later than 6 months after the
cessation of the pilot program, a report to the Department on the success of the pilot
program and a plan for its broader implementation. Section 4 of this bill provides
that the pilot program established by section 2 expires by limitation on July 1,
2029.
