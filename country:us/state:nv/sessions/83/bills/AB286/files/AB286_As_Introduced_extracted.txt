EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; making an appropriation to the
University of Nevada, Las Vegas, to establish a pilot
program to assess the competency of applicants for a
license to teach through the use of alternative assessment
methods; requiring certain regulations adopted by the
Commission on Professional Standards in Education to
authorize an applicant for a license to teach to be exempt
from requirements to pass a competency test in various
subjects if the applicant completes the pilot program; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates the Commission on Professional Standards in Education
2 and requires the Commission to adopt regulations prescribing the qualifications for
3 licensing teachers and other educational personnel. (NRS 391.011, 391.019)
4 Existing law additionally requires the Commission to adopt regulations: (1)
5 governing examinations for the initial licensing of teachers and other educational
6 personnel; and (2) authorizing an applicant for such licenses to be exempt from the
7 requirement to pass a competency test in basic reading, writing and mathematics if
8 he or she satisfies certain requirements (NRS 391.021) Existing regulations provide
9 that an applicant is exempt from the requirement to pass such a competency test if
10 the applicant submits to the Department of Education evidence that he or she
11 completed: (1) the “Praxis Core Academic Skills for Educators” in reading,
12 mathematics and writing, prepared and administered by the Educational Testing
13 Service; or (2) an equivalent test, as determined by the Department. (NAC 391.036)

14 Section 1 of this bill provides that the regulations adopted by the Commission must
15 also authorize an applicant for an initial license to teach to be exempt from the
16 requirement to pass a competency test in basic reading, writing and mathematics if
17 he or she satisfactorily completes the pilot program established pursuant to section
18 2 of this bill.
19 Section 3 of this bill appropriates money to the University of Nevada, Las
20 Vegas, to establish a pilot program to offer an alternative pathway for assessing the
21 competency of prospective teachers through the use of alternative assessment
22 methods. Section 2: (1) sets forth the requirements for the program; and (2)
23 provides that the pilot program must have not more than 100 participants, requiring
24 that each participant be an applicant for an initial license to teach who currently
25 holds a provisional license to teach. Furthermore, section 2 sets forth the
26 requirements governing the composition of participants, including that: (1) not
27 more than 60 percent of participants be employed by a school district in a county
28 whose population is 100,000 or more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties); (2)
29 not more than 40 percent of participants be employed by a school district in a
30 county whose population is less than 100,000 (currently all counties other than
31 Clark and Washoe Counties); (3) participants be from at least five different school
32 districts; (4) there be at least one graduate from each institution within the Nevada
33 System of Higher Education; (5) for each regional training program, there be at
34 least one participant who received professional development services from the
35 regional training program; and (6) there be at least one participant who is a member
36 of certain employee organizations.
37 For a participant in the pilot program, section 2 requires the Department to
38 extend the deadline for successfully passing a competency test, which is required to
39 receive an initial license to teach, for a period of 24 months after he or she is
40 selected to participate in the program, thereby allowing the participant to use his or
41 her satisfactory completion of the pilot program to satisfy requirements to receive
42 an exemption from completing certain competency tests. Section 2 also requires the
43 University of Nevada, Las Vegas, to submit: (1) an annual progress report
44 regarding the pilot program to the Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau for
45 distribution to the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Education; and (2) not later
46 than 6 months after the cessation of the pilot program, a report to the Department
47 on the success of the pilot program and a plan for its broader implementation.
