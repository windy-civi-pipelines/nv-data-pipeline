EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to education; authorizing one or more institutions
of higher education within the Nevada System of Higher
Education to establish a pilot program to assess the
competency of applicants for a license to teach through
the use of alternative assessment methods; requiring
certain regulations adopted by the Commission on
Professional Standards in Education to authorize an
applicant for a license to teach to be exempt from
requirements to pass a competency test in various subjects
if the applicant completes the pilot program; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates the Commission on Professional Standards in Education
2 and requires the Commission to adopt regulations prescribing the qualifications for
3 licensing teachers and other educational personnel. (NRS 391.011, 391.019)
4 Existing law additionally requires the Commission to adopt regulations governing
5 examinations for the initial licensing of teachers and other educational personnel.
6 (NRS 391.021) Existing regulations provide that an applicant is exempt from the
7 requirement to pass a competency test in the principles and methods of teaching if
8 the applicant submits to the Department of Education evidence that he or she: (1)
9 completed the “Principles of Learning and Teaching Test” prepared and
10 administered by the Educational Testing Service; or (2) is applying for a license
11 with an endorsement in an area for which training in the principles and methods of
12 teaching is not required. (NAC 391.036) Section 1 of this bill provides that the
-

– 2 –
13 regulations adopted by the Commission must also authorize an applicant for an
14 initial license to teach to be exempt from the requirement to pass a competency test
15 in the principles and methods of teaching if he or she satisfactorily completes the
16 pilot program established pursuant to section 2 of this bill.
17 Section 2 authorizes institutions within the Nevada System of Higher
18 Education to establish a pilot program to offer an alternative pathway for assessing
19 the competency of prospective teachers through the use of alternative assessment
20 methods. Section 2: (1) sets forth the requirements for the program; and (2)
21 provides that the pilot program must select not more than 100 participants each
22 academic year during the duration of the program; and (3) requires that each
23 participant be an applicant for an initial license to teach who currently holds a
24 provisional license to teach or an endorsement or license to serve as a substitute
25 teacher.
26 For a participant in the pilot program, section 2 requires the Department to
27 extend the deadline for successfully passing a competency test, which is required to
28 receive an initial license to teach, for a period of 24 months after he or she is
29 selected to participate in the program, thereby allowing the participant to use his or
30 her satisfactory completion of the pilot program to satisfy by exemption the
31 requirement to complete certain competency tests. Section 2 also requires each
32 institution that established a pilot program to submit: (1) an annual progress report
33 regarding the pilot program to the Commission, the State Board of Education and
34 the Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau for distribution to the Joint Interim
35 Standing Committee on Education; and (2) not later than 6 months after the
36 cessation of the pilot program, a report to the Department on the success of the pilot
37 program and a plan for its broader implementation. Section 4 of this bill provides
38 that the pilot program established by section 2 expires by limitation on July 1,
39 2029.
