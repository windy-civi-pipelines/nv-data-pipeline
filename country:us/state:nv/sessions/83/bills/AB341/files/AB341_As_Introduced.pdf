AN ACT relating to housing; prohibiting a landlord from refusing to
rent a dwelling to a corporation that rents a dwelling on
behalf of a person with a disability solely because the
corporation provides assistance in obtaining housing to a
person with a disability; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law sets forth the Nevada Fair Housing Law which prohibits certain
2 discriminatory housing practices. (NRS 118.010-118.120) The Nevada Fair
3 Housing Law prohibits a person from refusing to sell or rent a dwelling to any
4 person on the basis of race, religious creed, color, national origin, disability, sexual
5 orientation, gender identity or expression, ancestry, familial status or sex. (NRS
6 118.100) Section 1 of this bill prohibits a landlord from refusing to rent or
7 negotiate for the rental of, or otherwise make unavailable or deny, a dwelling to a
8 corporation that rents a dwelling on behalf of a person with a disability solely
9 because the corporation provides assistance in obtaining housing to a person with a
10 disability. Section 1 requires a landlord to submit a written explanation of the
11 reasons the landlord denied an application to rent a dwelling submitted by such a
12 corporation to the corporation, the Aging and Disability Services Division of the
13 Department of Health and Human Services and the Office of the Ombudsman for
14 Owners in Common-Interest Communities and Condominium Hotels within 7 days
15 after the landlord denies such an application.
16 Section 2 of this bill applies the definitions in existing law governing the
17 Nevada Fair Housing Law to the provisions of section 1.

18 Existing law provides a tenant with a defense in a summary proceeding or
19 action for possession of a dwelling if the landlord’s attempt to terminate the
20 tenancy or regain possession violates certain provisions that prohibit discriminatory
21 housing practices. (NRS 118.115) Section 3 of this bill applies this provision to a
22 violation of section 1.
23 Existing law authorizes a person to file an action in any district court of this
24 State to enforce certain provisions that prohibit discriminatory housing practices. If
25 the plaintiff prevails, the court may award to the plaintiff actual damages, punitive
26 damages, court costs and a reasonable attorney’s fee. (NRS 118.120) Section 4 of
27 this bill authorizes a person to enforce the provisions of section 1 by filing such an
28 action.
29 Existing law prohibits a landlord from taking certain retaliatory actions against
30 a tenant who has complained in good faith to certain persons or entities of a
31 violation of the Nevada Fair Housing Law. (NRS 118A.510) Section 5 of this bill
32 applies this provision to a violation of section 1.
33 Under existing law, a person who claims to have been injured by a
34 discriminatory housing practice is authorized to file a complaint with the Nevada
35 Equal Rights Commission. (NRS 118.110) Under this bill, a person who claims to
36 have been injured by a violation of section 1 is also authorized to file a complaint.

7 assistance in obtaining housing to a person with a disability.
8 2. If such a corporation applies for an available dwelling on
9 behalf of a person with a disability and the application is denied,
10 the landlord shall submit to the corporation, the Aging and
11 Disability Services Division of the Department of Health and

8 alleged violation of any of those provisions. If the court determines

19 required by the rental agreement or this chapter, or bring or threaten
20 to bring an action for possession if:

41 (g) The tenant has complained in good faith to the landlord, a
42 government agency, an attorney, a fair housing agency or any other

22 (b) The tenancy is terminated with cause;

26 tenant’s dwelling unit is vacant; or

28 tenants.

30 prevent the tenant from seeking damages or injunctive relief for the
31 landlord’s failure to comply with the rental agreement or maintain
32 the dwelling unit in a habitable condition as required by this chapter.
33 4. As used in this section:
34 (a) “Cotenant” has the meaning ascribed to it in NRS 118A.345.
