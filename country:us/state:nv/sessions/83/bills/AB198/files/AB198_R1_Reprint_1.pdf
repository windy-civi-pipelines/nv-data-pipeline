Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Sections 2-13 of this bill set forth certain requirements and restrictions
2 concerning inflatable devices and certain businesses that operate such devices.
3 Section 3 defines the term “inflatable device” to mean an air-filled device that: (1)
4 incorporates certain structural and mechanical elements to achieve its strength,
5 shape and stability by tensioning from internal air pressure; and (2) is intended for
6 use by a person to bounce, play, slide, climb or otherwise interact for outdoor
7 recreation, including a constant air inflatable bounce house, inflatable waterslide or
8 similar device. Section 5 defines the term “operator business” to mean a business
9 entity which is engaged in the business of making inflatable devices available for
10 use in this State and which employs, controls, directs or hires as an independent
11 contractor an operator to act on behalf of the business entity. Section 4 defines the
12 term “operator” to mean a person on-site at the location where an inflatable device
13 is used who sets up, operates, maintains or supervises the use of the inflatable
14 device on behalf of an operator business.
15 Section 6 prohibits a person from engaging in the business of an operator
16 business unless the person: (1) holds all applicable state and local business licenses;

17 and (2) has obtained certain insurance or a surety bond in an amount of not less
18 than $1,000,000.
19 Section 7 requires an operator business to keep a logbook for any inflatable
20 device that is made available for use by the operator business, which must be kept
21 with the inflatable device and made available for inspection at the request of certain
22 persons and any state or local agency. Sections 7-11 require an operator, before and
23 during each use of an inflatable device, to conduct certain inspections of the device
24 and the area in which it will be used and to record and retain for not less than 2
25 years the results of those inspections and certain other information in the logbook.
26 Section 8 prohibits an operator from allowing any person to use the inflatable
27 device if an inspection reveals or would have revealed a hazard or potential hazard
28 that would make use of the inflatable device unsafe, according to the requirements
29 of this bill or the requirements or recommendations contained in any user manual
30 provided by the manufacturer of the inflatable device, any update to such a user
31 manual and any information relating to a recall of the inflatable device. Section 9
32 prohibits an operator from allowing a person to use an inflatable device if any label
33 attached by the manufacturer of the device is missing. Section 9 also prohibits an
34 operator business from selling or transferring an inflatable device if any such label
35 is missing or if any user manual provided by the manufacturer, any update to such a
36 user manual and any information relating to a recall of the inflatable device is not
37 provided to the seller or transferee. Section 10 requires an operator to: (1) monitor
38 wind speed at any location where an inflatable device will be used at all times while
39 the device is in use; and (2) cease operation of the inflatable device if the wind
40 speed exceeds the recommendation of the manufacturer or 15 miles per hour,
41 whichever is greater. Section 11 prescribes certain requirements for anchoring the
42 inflatable device to the ground.
43 Section 13.5 of this bill authorizes a county, city or town to enact an ordinance
44 which establishes requirements and restrictions which are the same as or in addition
45 to those set forth in this bill and which provides for the imposition of criminal or
46 civil penalties, or both, for violations of those requirements and restrictions.
1 Whereas, Lizzy Hammond, a seventh-generation Nevadan, was
2 born in Reno, Nevada, on November 2, 2009; and
3 Whereas, Lizzy Hammond lost her life on July 14, 2019, in
4 Reno, Nevada, when an inflatable device in which she was playing
5 unexpectedly took flight in a gust of wind; and
6 Whereas, Lizzy Hammond donated her organs to help protect
7 the lives of others; and
8 Whereas, The Legislature intends to better protect the public
9 safety by imposing requirements and restrictions concerning the
10 operation of inflatable devices and the businesses that operate such
11 devices; now, therefore,
12
