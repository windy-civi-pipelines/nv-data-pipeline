device and the area in which it will be used and to record and retain for not less
than 2 years the results of those inspections and certain other information in the
logbook. Section 8 prohibits an operator from allowing any person to use the
inflatable device if an inspection reveals or would have revealed a hazard or
potential hazard that would make use of the inflatable device unsafe according to
the requirements of this bill or the requirements or recommendations contained in
any user manual provided by the manufacturer of the inflatable device, any update
to such a user manual and any information relating to a recall of the inflatable
device. Section 9 prohibits an operator from allowing a person to use an inflatable
