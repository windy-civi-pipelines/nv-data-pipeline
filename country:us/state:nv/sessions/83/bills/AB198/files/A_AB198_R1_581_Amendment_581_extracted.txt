2 inflatable devices and certain businesses that operate such devices. Section 3 defines the term
3 “inflatable device” to mean an air-filled device that: (1) incorporates certain structural and
4 mechanical elements to achieve its strength, shape and stability by tensioning from internal air
5 pressure; [and] (2) is intended for use by a person to bounce, play, slide, climb or otherwise
6 interact for outdoor recreation [, including] ; and (3) includes a constant air inflatable bounce
7 house, inflatable [waterslide] water slide or similar device. Section 5 defines the term

9 inflatable devices available for use in this State and which employs, controls, directs or hires
10 as an independent contractor an operator to act on behalf of the business entity. Section 4

12 is used who sets up, operates, maintains or supervises the use of the inflatable device on
13 behalf of an operator business.
14 Section 6 prohibits a person from engaging in the business of an operator business unless
15 the person: (1) holds all applicable state and local business licenses; and (2) has obtained
16 certain insurance or a surety bond in an amount of not less than $1,000,000.
17 Section 7 requires an operator business to keep a logbook for any inflatable device that is

19 and made available for inspection at the request of certain persons and any state or local
20 agency. Sections [7-11] 7 and 8 require an operator, before and during each use of an
21 inflatable device, to conduct certain inspections of the device and the area in which it will be
22 used and to record and retain for not less than 2 years the results of those inspections and
Senate Amendment No. 581 to Assembly Bill No. 198 First Reprint Page 4
23 certain other information in the logbook. Section 8 prohibits an operator from allowing any
24 person to use the inflatable device if an inspection reveals or would have revealed a hazard or
25 potential hazard that would make use of the inflatable device unsafe [,] according to the
26 requirements of this bill or the requirements or recommendations contained in any user
27 manual provided by the manufacturer of the inflatable device, any update to such a user
28 manual and any information relating to a recall of the inflatable device. Section 9 prohibits an
29 operator from allowing a person to use an inflatable device if any label attached by the
30 manufacturer of the device is missing [.] or illegible. Section 9 also prohibits an operator
31 business from selling or transferring an inflatable device if any such label is missing or

34 purchaser or transferee. Section 10 requires an operator to: (1) monitor wind speed at any
35 location where an inflatable device will be used at all times while the device is in use; and (2)
36 cease operation of the inflatable device if the wind speed exceeds the recommendation of the
37 manufacturer or 15 miles per hour, whichever is greater. Section 11 prescribes certain
38 requirements for anchoring the inflatable device to the ground. Section 12 requires an
39 operator to display a sign containing certain information at all times during the use of an
40 inflatable device.
41 Section 13.5 of this bill authorizes a county, city or town to enact an ordinance which
42 establishes requirements and restrictions which are the same as or in addition to those set forth
43 in this bill and which provides for the imposition of criminal or civil penalties, or both, for
44 violations of those requirements and restrictions.

2 inflatable devices and certain businesses that operate such devices. Section 3 defines the term
3 “inflatable device” to mean an air-filled device that: (1) incorporates certain structural and

15 the person: (1) holds all applicable state and local business licenses; and (2) has obtained
16 certain insurance or a surety bond in an amount of not less than $1,000,000.
17 Section 7 requires an operator business to keep a logbook for any inflatable device that is

25 potential hazard that would make use of the inflatable device unsafe [,] according to the
26 requirements of this bill or the requirements or recommendations contained in any user
27 manual provided by the manufacturer of the inflatable device, any update to such a user
28 manual and any information relating to a recall of the inflatable device. Section 9 prohibits an
29 operator from allowing a person to use an inflatable device if any label attached by the

38 requirements for anchoring the inflatable device to the ground. Section 12 requires an
39 operator to display a sign containing certain information at all times during the use of an
40 inflatable device.
41 Section 13.5 of this bill authorizes a county, city or town to enact an ordinance which
