EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to trade regulations; setting forth certain requirements and

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Sections 2-13 of this bill set forth certain requirements and restrictions concerning
2 inflatable devices and certain businesses that operate such devices. Section 3 defines the term
3 “inflatable device” to mean an air-filled device that: (1) incorporates certain structural and
4 mechanical elements to achieve its strength, shape and stability by tensioning from internal air
5 pressure; and (2) [can be used] is intended for use by a person to bounce, play, slide, climb or
6 otherwise interact for outdoor recreation, including a constant air inflatable bounce house,
7 inflatable waterslide or similar device. Section 5 defines the term “operator business” to mean
8 a business entity which is engaged in the business of making inflatable devices available for
9 use in this State and which employs, controls, directs or hires as an independent contractor an
10 operator to act on behalf of the business entity. Section 4 defines the term “operator” to mean
11 a person on-site at the location where an inflatable device is used who sets up, operates,
12 maintains or supervises the use of the inflatable device on behalf of an operator business.
13 Section 6 prohibits a person from engaging in the business of an operator business unless
14 the person: (1) holds all applicable state and local business licenses; and (2) has obtained
15 certain insurance or a surety bond in an amount of not less than $1,000,000.
16 Section 7 requires an operator business to keep a logbook for any inflatable device that is
17 made available for use by the operator business, which must be kept with the inflatable device
18 and made available for inspection at the request of [any person.] certain persons and any
19 state or local agency. Sections [8-11] 7-11 require an operator, before and during each use of
20 an inflatable device, to conduct certain inspections of the device and the area in which it will
21 be used and to record and retain for not less than 2 years the results of those inspections and
22 certain other information in the logbook. Section 8 prohibits an operator from allowing any
Assembly Amendment No. 41 to Assembly Bill No. 198 Page 4
23 person to use the inflatable device if an inspection reveals or would have revealed a hazard
24 or potential hazard that would make use of the inflatable device unsafe, according to the
25 requirements of this bill or the requirements or recommendations contained in any user
26 manual provided by the manufacturer of the inflatable device [.] , any update to such a user
27 manual and any information relating to a recall of the inflatable device. Section 9
28 prohibits an operator from allowing a person to use an inflatable device if any label attached
29 by the manufacturer of the device is missing. Section 9 also prohibits an operator business
30 from selling or transferring an inflatable device if any such label is missing or if any user
31 manual provided by the manufacturer , any update to such a user manual and any
32 information relating to a recall of the inflatable device is not provided to the seller or
33 transferee. Section 10 requires an operator to: (1) monitor wind speed at any location where
34 an inflatable device will be used at all times while the device is in use; and (2) cease operation
35 of the inflatable device if the wind speed exceeds the recommendation of the manufacturer or
36 [10] 15 miles per hour, whichever is [less.] greater. Section 11 prescribes certain
37 requirements for anchoring the inflatable device to the ground.
38 [Section 13 of this bill provides that a violation of the provisions of this bill creates a
39 conclusive presumption in certain civil actions that the operator or operator business acted
40 recklessly.] Section 13.5 of this bill authorizes a county, city or town to enact an
41 ordinance which establishes requirements and restrictions which are the same as or in
42 addition to those set forth in this bill and which provides for the imposition of criminal
43 or civil penalties, or both, for violations of those requirements and restrictions.

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Sections 2-13 of this bill set forth certain requirements and restrictions concerning
2 inflatable devices and certain businesses that operate such devices. Section 3 defines the term
3 “inflatable device” to mean an air-filled device that: (1) incorporates certain structural and
4 mechanical elements to achieve its strength, shape and stability by tensioning from internal air

6 otherwise interact for outdoor recreation, including a constant air inflatable bounce house,
7 inflatable waterslide or similar device. Section 5 defines the term “operator business” to mean

9 use in this State and which employs, controls, directs or hires as an independent contractor an
10 operator to act on behalf of the business entity. Section 4 defines the term “operator” to mean
11 a person on-site at the location where an inflatable device is used who sets up, operates,

14 the person: (1) holds all applicable state and local business licenses; and (2) has obtained
15 certain insurance or a surety bond in an amount of not less than $1,000,000.

23 person to use the inflatable device if an inspection reveals or would have revealed a hazard
24 or potential hazard that would make use of the inflatable device unsafe, according to the
25 requirements of this bill or the requirements or recommendations contained in any user
26 manual provided by the manufacturer of the inflatable device [.] , any update to such a user
27 manual and any information relating to a recall of the inflatable device. Section 9
28 prohibits an operator from allowing a person to use an inflatable device if any label attached

40 recklessly.] Section 13.5 of this bill authorizes a county, city or town to enact an
