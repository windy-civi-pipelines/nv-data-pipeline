Assembly Bill No. 595–Committee on Ways and Means
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to fiscal notes; revising provisions governing the
information concerning fiscal effect that must be included in
the summary of each bill or joint resolution introduced in the
Legislature; revising provisions governing the preparation of
fiscal notes; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law requires the Fiscal Analysis Division of the Legislative Counsel
Bureau to obtain a fiscal note on each bill or joint resolution that: (1) creates or
increases any fiscal liability of the State or decreases any revenue of the State
which appears to be in excess of $2,000; or (2) increases or newly provides for a
term of imprisonment in the state prison or makes release on parole or probation
from the state prison less likely. However, such a fiscal note is not required on any
bill or joint resolution relating exclusively to the proposed executive budget. (NRS
218D.430) For the purpose of indicating whether the Fiscal Analysis Division is
required to obtain a fiscal note on a bill or joint resolution, the summary of each bill
or joint resolution introduced in the Legislature is required to include a statement of
the fiscal effect on the State. Such a statement may include, without limitation, a
statement that the fiscal effect on the State is included in the Executive Budget or
contains an appropriation included in the Executive Budget. (NRS 218D.415) This
bill clarifies that for the purposes of determining the fiscal effect on the State
included in the summary of a bill or joint resolution and whether or not the Fiscal
Analysis Division is required to obtain a fiscal note, the “Executive Budget” is the
proposed budget submitted by the Governor to the Legislature not later than 14
calendar days before the commencement of the regular legislative session.
