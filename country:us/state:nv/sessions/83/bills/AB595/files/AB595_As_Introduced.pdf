~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to fiscal notes; revising provisions governing the
information concerning fiscal effect that must be included
in the summary of each bill or joint resolution introduced
in the Legislature; revising provisions governing the
preparation of fiscal notes; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Fiscal Analysis Division of the Legislative Counsel
2 Bureau to obtain a fiscal note on each bill or joint resolution that: (1) creates or
3 increases any fiscal liability of the State or decreases any revenue of the State
4 which appears to be in excess of $2,000; or (2) increases or newly provides for a
5 term of imprisonment in the state prison or makes release on parole or probation
6 from the state prison less likely. However, such a fiscal note is not required on any
7 bill or joint resolution relating exclusively to the proposed executive budget. (NRS
8 218D.430) For the purpose of indicating whether the Fiscal Analysis Division is
9 required to obtain a fiscal note on a bill or joint resolution, the summary of each bill
10 or joint resolution introduced in the Legislature is required to include a statement of
11 the fiscal effect on the State. Such a statement may include, without limitation, a
12 statement that the fiscal effect on the State is included in the Executive Budget or
13 contains an appropriation included in the Executive Budget. (NRS 218D.415) This
14 bill clarifies that for the purposes of determining the fiscal effect on the State
15 included in the summary of a bill or joint resolution and whether or not the Fiscal
16 Analysis Division is required to obtain a fiscal note, the “Executive Budget” is the
17 proposed budget submitted by the Governor to the Legislature not later than 14
18 calendar days before the commencement of the regular legislative session.
