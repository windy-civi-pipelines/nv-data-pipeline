EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to victims of crime; revising certain requirements
for receiving compensation from the Fund for the
Compensation of Victims of Crime; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes certain victims of crime to apply for and receive
2 payment of compensation from the Fund for the Compensation of Victims of Crime
3 under certain circumstances. (NRS 217.010-217.270) Existing law generally
4 requires an application for compensation from the Fund to be filed not later than 24
5 months after the injury or death for which compensation is claimed, or not later
6 than 60 months after the injury or death for which compensation is claimed if the
7 applicant is a victim of sex trafficking or facilitating sex trafficking. (NRS 217.100)
8 This bill makes various changes to require all applications for compensation from
9 the Fund to be filed not later than 60 months after the injury or death for which
10 compensation is claimed.
11 Existing law authorizes the Director of the Department of Health and Human
12 Services to waive the limitation on the time for filing an application for
13 compensation from the Fund for good cause shown if the injury or death for which
14 compensation is claimed was the result of an incident or offense that was reported
15 to the police within 5 days of its occurrence or within 5 days of the time when a
16 report could reasonably have been made. (NRS 217.100) This bill removes the
17 condition that to be eligible for the waiver, the incident or offense that caused the
18 injury or death for which compensation is claimed be reported to the police, thereby
19 authorizing the Director to waive the limitation on the time for filing an application
20 for any good cause shown.
21 Existing law requires an application for compensation from the Fund to be
22 accompanied by certain medical records that document the injury for which
23 compensation is claimed. (NRS 217.100) This bill expands the types of documents
24 that the applicant may provide to evidence the injury for which compensation is
25 claimed.
