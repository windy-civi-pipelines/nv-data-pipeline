AN ACT relating to victims of crime; revising certain provisions
relating to the Fund for the Compensation of Victims of
Crime; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes certain victims of crime to apply for and receive
2 payment of compensation from the Fund for the Compensation of Victims of Crime
3 under certain circumstances. (NRS 217.010-217.270) Existing law generally
4 requires an application for compensation from the Fund to be filed: (1) not later
5 than 24 months after the injury or death for which compensation is claimed; (2) not
6 later than 60 months after the injury or death for which compensation is claimed if
7 the applicant is a victim of sex trafficking or facilitating sex trafficking; or (3)
8 before the applicant reaches 21 years of age if the applicant is a victim of sexual
9 abuse or involved in the production of pornography and the applicant was a minor
10 at the time of the injury. (NRS 217.100) Section 1 of this bill makes various
11 changes to require all applications for compensation from the Fund to be filed not
12 later than 60 months after the injury or death for which compensation is claimed,
13 unless the applicant was a minor at the time of the injury, in which case the
14 application must be filed not later than 60 months after the applicant reaches 21
15 years of age.
16 Existing law authorizes the Director of the Department of Health and Human
17 Services or a person designated by the Director to waive the limitation on the time
18 for filing an application for compensation from the Fund for good cause shown if
19 the injury or death for which compensation is claimed was the result of an incident
20 or offense that was reported to the police within 5 days after its occurrence or
21 within 5 days after the time when a report could reasonably have been made. (NRS
22 217.100) Section 1 removes the condition that to be eligible for the waiver, the
23 incident or offense that caused the injury or death for which compensation is
24 claimed be reported to the police, thereby authorizing the Director or a person

25 designated by the Director to waive the limitation on the time for filing an
26 application for any good cause shown.
27 Existing law requires an application for compensation from the Fund to be
28 accompanied by certain medical records that document the injury for which
29 compensation is claimed. (NRS 217.100) Section 1 removes this requirement and
30 instead provides that the applicant may prove eligibility for compensation from the
31 Fund by submitting certain documentary evidence of the injury or death for which
32 compensation is claimed.
33 Existing law prohibits an award of compensation from the Fund under certain
34 circumstances, including compensation to a victim of crime who fails to cooperate
35 with a law enforcement agency. (NRS 217.220) Section 2 of this bill removes the
36 prohibition against the award of compensation from the Fund to a victim of a crime
37 who fails to cooperate with a law enforcement agency.
