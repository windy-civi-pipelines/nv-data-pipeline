Assembly Bill No. 329–Assemblymember Roth
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to victims of crime; revising certain provisions
relating to the Fund for the Compensation of Victims of
Crime; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law authorizes certain victims of crime to apply for and receive
payment of compensation from the Fund for the Compensation of Victims of Crime
under certain circumstances. (NRS 217.010-217.270) Existing law generally
requires an application for compensation from the Fund to be filed: (1) not later
than 24 months after the injury or death for which compensation is claimed; (2) not
later than 60 months after the injury or death for which compensation is claimed if
the applicant is a victim of sex trafficking or facilitating sex trafficking; or (3)
before the applicant reaches 21 years of age if the applicant is a victim of sexual
abuse or involved in the production of pornography and the applicant was a minor
at the time of the injury. (NRS 217.100) Section 1 of this bill makes various
changes to require all applications for compensation from the Fund to be filed not
later than 60 months after the injury or death for which compensation is claimed,
unless the applicant was a minor at the time of the injury, in which case the
application must be filed not later than 60 months after the applicant reaches 21
years of age.
Existing law authorizes the Director of the Department of Health and Human
Services or a person designated by the Director to waive the limitation on the time
for filing an application for compensation from the Fund for good cause shown if
the injury or death for which compensation is claimed was the result of an incident
or offense that was reported to the police within 5 days after its occurrence or
within 5 days after the time when a report could reasonably have been made. (NRS
217.100) Section 1 removes the condition that to be eligible for the waiver, the
incident or offense that caused the injury or death for which compensation is
claimed be reported to the police, thereby authorizing the Director or a person
designated by the Director to waive the limitation on the time for filing an
application for any good cause shown.
Existing law requires an application for compensation from the Fund to be
accompanied by certain medical records that document the injury for which
compensation is claimed. (NRS 217.100) Section 1 removes this requirement and
instead provides that the applicant may prove eligibility for compensation from the
Fund by submitting certain documentary evidence of the injury or death for which
compensation is claimed.
Existing law prohibits an award of compensation from the Fund under certain
circumstances, including compensation to a victim of crime who fails to cooperate
with a law enforcement agency. (NRS 217.220) Section 2 of this bill removes the
prohibition against the award of compensation from the Fund to a victim of a crime
who fails to cooperate with a law enforcement agency.
