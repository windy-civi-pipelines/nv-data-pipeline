AN ACT relating to victims of crime; revising certain [requirements for receiving
compensation from] provisions relating to the Fund for the
Compensation of Victims of Crime; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes certain victims of crime to apply for and receive payment of
2 compensation from the Fund for the Compensation of Victims of Crime under certain
3 circumstances. (NRS 217.010-217.270) Existing law generally requires an application for
4 compensation from the Fund to be filed : (1) not later than 24 months after the injury or death
5 for which compensation is claimed [, or] ; (2) not later than 60 months after the injury or
6 death for which compensation is claimed if the applicant is a victim of sex trafficking or
7 facilitating sex trafficking [.] ; or (3) before the applicant reaches 21 years of age if the
8 applicant is a victim of sexual abuse or involved in the production of pornography and
9 the applicant was a minor at the time of the injury. (NRS 217.100) [This] Section 1 of this
10 bill makes various changes to require all applications for compensation from the Fund to be
11 filed not later than 60 months after the injury or death for which compensation is claimed [.] ,
12 unless the applicant was a minor at the time of the injury, in which case the application
13 must be filed not later than 60 months after the applicant reaches 21 years of age.
14 Existing law authorizes the Director of the Department of Health and Human Services or
15 a person designated by the Director to waive the limitation on the time for filing an
16 application for compensation from the Fund for good cause shown if the injury or death for
17 which compensation is claimed was the result of an incident or offense that was reported to
18 the police within 5 days [of] after its occurrence or within 5 days [of] after the time when a
19 report could reasonably have been made. (NRS 217.100) [This bill] Section 1 removes the
20 condition that to be eligible for the waiver, the incident or offense that caused the injury or
21 death for which compensation is claimed be reported to the police, thereby authorizing the
22 Director or a person designated by the Director to waive the limitation on the time for filing
23 an application for any good cause shown.
24 Existing law requires an application for compensation from the Fund to be accompanied
25 by certain medical records that document the injury for which compensation is claimed. (NRS
26 217.100) [This bill expands the types of documents] Section 1 removes this requirement
27 and instead provides that the applicant may [provide to] prove eligibility for compensation
28 from the Fund by submitting certain documentary evidence of the injury or death for
29 which compensation is claimed.
30 Existing law prohibits an award of compensation from the Fund under certain
31 circumstances, including compensation to a victim of crime who fails to cooperate with a

Assembly Amendment No. 146 to Assembly Bill No. 329 Page 4
32 law enforcement agency. (NRS 217.220) Section 2 of this bill removes the prohibition
33 against the award of compensation from the Fund to a victim of a crime who fails to
34 cooperate with a law enforcement agency.
