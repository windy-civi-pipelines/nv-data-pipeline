SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to health insurance
coverage for biomarker testing. (BDR 57-913)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
CONTAINS UNFUNDED MANDATE (§ 2 & NRS 287.010)
(NOT REQUESTED BY AFFECTED LOCAL GOVERNMENT)
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to insurance; expanding the scope of required
insurance coverage for biomarker testing; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires certain public and private health plans, including
2 Medicaid and health plans for state and local employees to provide coverage, in
3 certain circumstances, for medically necessary biomarker testing for the diagnosis,
4 treatment, appropriate management and ongoing monitoring of cancer when such
5 biomarker testing is supported by medical evidence. (NRS 287.010, 287.04335,
6 422.272364, 689A.0446, 689B.0361, 695C.050, 689C.1688, 695A.1859,
7 695B.19087, 695C.16932, 695G.1703) This bill removes the limitations that such
8 coverage is only required if the biomarker testing is: (1) medically necessary; and
9 (2) for the diagnosis, treatment, appropriate management and ongoing monitoring
10 of cancer. This bill thus requires public and private health plans to cover any
11 biomarker testing for the diagnosis, treatment, appropriate management and
12 ongoing management of a medical condition or disease when such biomarker
13 testing is supported by medical evidence, regardless of whether the biomarker
14 testing is determined to be medically necessary.
