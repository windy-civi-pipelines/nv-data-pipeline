Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates the Housing Division in the Department of Business and
2 Industry and charges the Division, among other duties, with responsibility for
3 increasing the availability of decent, safe and sanitary housing for persons of low
4 and moderate income in this State. (NRS 232.510; chapter 319 of NRS) Existing
5 law creates the position of Housing Advocate within the Division and establishes
6 the duties for the position, which include providing information and assistance to
7 persons who reside in affordable housing and manufactured housing. (NRS
8 319.141) Section 1 of this bill renames the position of Housing Advocate as the
9 Housing Liaison.
10 Existing law requires the Division to create and maintain a statewide low-
11 income housing database. The database is required to include certain information
12 relating to low-income housing, including compilations and analysis of
-
*AB37*

– 2 –
13 demographic, economic and housing data from a variety of sources. (NRS 319.143)
14 Section 2 of this bill requires the inclusion of any survey conducted by the Division
15 in the database. Section 2 also revises the data that is required to be included in the
16 database by: (1) changing the measure for determining the number of households in
17 various population groups experiencing high housing costs from 50 to 30 percent of
18 household income; (2) increasing from 2 years to 3 years the length of the planning
19 period for identifying when subsidized units are forecast to convert to market-rate
20 units; and (3) adding information regarding certain multi-family residential
21 housing. Section 2 further requires the Division, on or before December 31 of each
22 year, to analyze the data in the database and prepare and post on its website a report
23 of its analysis.
24 Existing law creates the Account for Affordable Housing in the State General
25 Fund, which is required to be administered by the Division, and prescribes the
26 distribution and use of money in the Account. (NRS 319.500, 319.510) Under
27 existing law, the costs to create and maintain the statewide low-income housing
28 database are required to be paid from the Account up to a maximum of $175,000
29 per year. (NRS 319.143, 319.510) Sections 2 and 3 of this bill: (1) require payment
30 from the Account of the costs to prepare the new annual report required by section
31 2; and (2) change the maximum annual amount authorized from the Account for the
32 payment of costs related to the database from the fixed amount of $175,000 to not
33 more than 6 percent of the money deposited in the Account in each fiscal year.
34 Existing law also authorizes the Division to expend not more than $40,000 per
35 year or an amount equal to 6 percent of money received pursuant to the federal
36 HOME Investment Partnerships Act, whichever is greater, as reimbursement for
37 administering the Account and that federal money. (NRS 319.510; 42 U.S.C. §§
38 12701 et seq.) Section 3: (1) eliminates the authority of the Division to receive
39 reimbursement from the Account for administering that federal money; and (2)
40 changes the maximum amount authorized from the Account as reimbursement for
41 administering the Account to not more than 6 percent of the money deposited in the
42 Account in each fiscal year.
43 Existing law requires the Division to distribute a certain portion of money in
44 the Account to certain charitable organizations, housing authorities and local
45 governments for the acquisition, construction and rehabilitation of affordable
46 housing for eligible families, subject to certain requirements. One such eligibility
47 requirement in existing law is that not less than 15 percent of the units acquired,
48 constructed or rehabilitated be affordable to persons whose income is at or below
49 the federally designated level signifying poverty. (NRS 319.510) Section 3: (1)
50 changes the income level for that requirement to at or below 30 percent of the
51 median monthly gross household income for the applicable county; and (2) clarifies
52 that the money is authorized to be distributed to one or more of the types of entities
53 that are eligible recipients. Section 3 also eliminates the eligibility requirement in
54 existing law that a local government sponsor such a project.
55 Existing law establishes three tiers of affordable housing for various purposes
56 in existing law and defines “affordable housing” as housing that falls within any of
57 the three tiers. (NRS 232.860, 244.189, 244.287, 268.058, 268.190, 278.0105,
58 279.385, 279A.020, 279B.020, 315.9625, 319.042) Under existing law, the tiers are
59 based on both household income and the costs of housing as a percentage of that
60 income. With respect to household income: (1) “tier one affordable housing” is
61 housing for a household which has a total monthly gross income that is equal to not
62 more than 60 percent of the median monthly gross household income for the county
63 in which the housing is located, which is commonly known as the area median
64 household income; (2) “tier two affordable housing” is housing for a household
65 which has a total monthly gross income that is equal to more than 60 percent but
66 not more than 80 percent of the area median household income; and (3) “tier three
67 affordable housing” is housing for a household which has a total monthly gross
-
*AB37*

– 3 –
68 income that is equal to more than 80 percent but not more than 120 percent of the
69 area median household income. In addition, with respect to the costs of housing,
70 affordable housing under existing law is housing that costs not more than 30
71 percent of the total monthly gross household income of the household with an
72 income at the maximum percentage of the area median household income for the
73 tier. (NRS 278.01902, 278.01904, 278,01906) Section 4 of this bill creates a new
74 tier of affordable housing, to be known as “tier one affordable housing,” that
75 addresses housing for a household that has a total monthly gross income that is
76 equal to not more than 30 percent of the area median household income. As a result
77 of the creation of this new tier of affordable housing, section 7 of this bill renames
78 “tier one affordable housing” in existing law as “tier two affordable housing” and
79 changes the percentage range for median income for that tier to more than 30
80 percent but not more than 60 percent of the area median household income. Section
81 9 of this bill renames “tier two affordable housing” in existing law, for which the
82 percentage range for median income is more than 60 percent but not more than 80
83 percent of the area median household income, as “workforce affordable housing.”
84 Section 8 of this bill renames “tier three affordable housing” in existing law, for
85 which the percentage range for median income is more than 80 percent but not
86 more than 120 percent of the area median household income, as “attainable
87 affordable housing.” Section 5 of this bill applies the newly defined term in section
88 4 to the provisions of existing law relating to planning and zoning. Sections 6 and
89 11 of this bill make conforming changes to existing law to reflect the new tier.
90 Existing law requires the governing body of certain cities or counties to submit
91 to the Division annual progress reports relating to affordable housing. (NRS
92 278.235) Existing law requires: (1) the inclusion of these reports in the statewide
93 low-income housing database; and (2) the Division to compile and post these
94 reports on its Internet website. (NRS 278.235, 319.143) Section 10 of this bill
95 moves the deadline for: (1) the submission of the reports to the Division from
96 July 15 to March 15; and (2) the posting of the compilation of the reports by the
97 Division from August 15 to April 15. Because the change in the deadlines is not
98 effective until October 1, 2025, pursuant to section 14 of this bill, the new
99 deadlines apply initially to the reports submitted in 2026.
