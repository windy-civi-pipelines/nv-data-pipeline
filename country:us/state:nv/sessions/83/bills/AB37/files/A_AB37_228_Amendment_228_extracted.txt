EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to housing; renaming the position of Housing Advocate within
the Housing Division of the Department of Business and Industry as
the Housing Liaison; revising provisions relating to the statewide low-
income housing database maintained by the Division; revising
provisions relating to the Account for Affordable Housing; revising
provisions governing the tiers of affordable housing; revising
provisions relating to certain reports submitted to the Division by
certain local governments relating to affordable housing; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates the Housing Division in the Department of Business and Industry
2 and charges the Division, among other duties, with responsibility for increasing the
3 availability of decent, safe and sanitary housing for persons of low and moderate income in
4 this State. (NRS 232.510; chapter 319 of NRS) Existing law creates the position of Housing
5 Advocate within the Division and establishes the duties for the position, which include
6 providing information and assistance to persons who reside in affordable housing and
7 manufactured housing. (NRS 319.141) Section 1 of this bill renames the position of Housing
8 Advocate as the Housing Liaison.
9 Existing law requires the Division to create and maintain a statewide low-income housing
10 database. The database is required to include certain information relating to low-income
11 housing, including compilations and analysis of demographic, economic and housing data
12 from a variety of sources. (NRS 319.143) Section 2 of this bill requires the inclusion of any
13 survey conducted by the Division in the database. Section 2 also revises the data that is
14 required to be included in the database by: (1) changing the measure for determining the
15 number of households in various population groups experiencing high housing costs from 50
16 to 30 percent of household income; (2) increasing from 2 years to 3 years the length of the
17 planning period for identifying when subsidized units are forecast to convert to market-rate
18 units; and (3) adding information regarding certain multi-family residential housing. Section 2
19 further requires the Division, on or before December 31 of each year, to analyze the data in
20 the database and prepare and post on its website a report of its analysis.
Assembly Amendment No. 228 to Assembly Bill No. 37 Page 4
21 Existing law creates the Account for Affordable Housing in the State General Fund,
22 which is required to be administered by the Division, and prescribes the distribution and use
23 of money in the Account. (NRS 319.500, 319.510) Under existing law, the costs to create and
24 maintain the statewide low-income housing database are required to be paid from the Account
25 up to a maximum of $175,000 per year. (NRS 319.143, 319.510) Sections 2 and 3 of this bill:
26 (1) require payment from the Account of the costs to prepare the new annual report required
27 by section 2; and (2) change the maximum annual amount authorized from the Account for
28 the payment of costs related to the database from the fixed amount of $175,000 to not more
29 than 6 percent of the money deposited in the Account in each fiscal year.
30 Existing law also authorizes the Division to expend not more than $40,000 per year or an
31 amount equal to 6 percent of money received pursuant to the federal HOME Investment
32 Partnerships Act, whichever is greater, as reimbursement for administering the Account and
33 that federal money. (NRS 319.510; 42 U.S.C. §§ 12701 et seq.) Section 3: (1) eliminates the
34 authority of the Division to receive reimbursement from the Account for administering that
35 federal money; and (2) changes the maximum amount authorized from the Account as
36 reimbursement for administering the Account to not more than 6 percent of the money
37 deposited in the Account in each fiscal year.
38 Existing law requires the Division to distribute a certain portion of the remaining money
39 in the Account to the Division of Welfare and Supportive Services of the Department of
40 Health and Human Services for a program to provide emergency assistance to needy
41 families with children. (NRS 319.510) Section 3 eliminates this required distribution to
42 the Division for this program, but specifically authorizes the use of money in the
43 Account for the same purpose. With the elimination of this distribution to the Division,
44 all of the remaining money in the Account will effectively be distributed to the other
45 authorized recipients in existing law, which are certain charitable organizations, housing
46 authorities and local governments for the acquisition, construction and rehabilitation of
47 affordable housing for eligible families, subject to certain requirements. One such eligibility
48 requirement in existing law is that not less than 15 percent of the units acquired, constructed
49 or rehabilitated be affordable to persons whose income is at or below the federally designated
50 level signifying poverty. (NRS 319.510) Section 3: (1) changes the income level for that
51 requirement to at or below 30 percent of the median monthly gross household income for the
52 applicable county; and (2) clarifies that the money is authorized to be distributed to one or
53 more of the types of entities that are eligible recipients. Section 3 also eliminates the
54 eligibility requirement in existing law that a local government sponsor such a project.
55 Existing law establishes three tiers of affordable housing for various purposes in existing
56 law and defines “affordable housing” as housing that falls within any of the three tiers. (NRS
57 232.860, 244.189, 244.287, 268.058, 268.190, 278.0105, 279.385, 279A.020, 279B.020,
58 315.9625, 319.042) Under existing law, the tiers are based on both household income and the
59 costs of housing as a percentage of that income. With respect to household income: (1) “tier
60 one affordable housing” is housing for a household which has a total monthly gross income
61 that is equal to not more than 60 percent of the median monthly gross household income for
62 the county in which the housing is located, which is commonly known as the area median
63 household income; (2) “tier two affordable housing” is housing for a household which has a
64 total monthly gross income that is equal to more than 60 percent but not more than 80 percent
65 of the area median household income; and (3) “tier three affordable housing” is housing for a
66 household which has a total monthly gross income that is equal to more than 80 percent but
67 not more than 120 percent of the area median household income. In addition, with respect to
68 the costs of housing, affordable housing under existing law is housing that costs not more than
69 30 percent of the total monthly gross household income of the household with an income at
70 the maximum percentage of the area median household income for the tier. (NRS 278.01902,
71 278.01904, 278,01906) Section 4 of this bill creates a new tier of affordable housing, to be
72 known as “tier one affordable housing,” that addresses housing for a household that has a total
73 monthly gross income that is equal to not more than 30 percent of the area median household
74 income. As a result of the creation of this new tier of affordable housing, section 7 of this bill
75 renames “tier one affordable housing” in existing law as “tier two affordable housing” and
76 changes the percentage range for median income for that tier to more than 30 percent but not
77 more than 60 percent of the area median household income. Section 9 of this bill renames
78 “tier two affordable housing” in existing law, for which the percentage range for median
79 income is more than 60 percent but not more than 80 percent of the area median household
Assembly Amendment No. 228 to Assembly Bill No. 37 Page 5
80 income, as [“workforce] “tier three affordable housing.” Section 8 of this bill renames “tier
81 three affordable housing” in existing law, for which the percentage range for median income
82 is more than 80 percent but not more than 120 percent of the area median household income,
83 as [“attainable] “tier four affordable housing.” Section 4.5 of this bill creates another new
84 tier of affordable housing, to be known as “tier five affordable housing,” that addresses
85 housing for a household that has a total monthly gross income that is equal to more than
86 120 percent but not more than 150 percent of the area median household income.
87 Section 5 of this bill applies the newly defined [term] terms in [section] sections 4 and 4.5 to
88 the provisions of existing law relating to planning and zoning. [Sections 6 and] Section 11 of
89 this bill [make] makes conforming changes to existing law to reflect the new [tier.] tiers.
90 Section 6 of this bill renames “affordable housing” as “attainable housing” and
91 includes “tier four affordable housing” and “tier five affordable housing” within its
92 meaning. Sections 2 and 10 of this bill make conforming changes to reflect the new
93 name.
94 Existing law requires the governing body of certain cities or counties to submit to the
95 Division annual progress reports relating to affordable housing. (NRS 278.235) Existing law
96 requires: (1) the inclusion of these reports in the statewide low-income housing database; and
97 (2) the Division to compile and post these reports on its Internet website. (NRS 278.235,
98 319.143) Section 10 [of this bill] moves the deadline for: (1) the submission of the reports to
99 the Division from July 15 to March 15; and (2) the posting of the compilation of the reports by
100 the Division from August 15 to April 15. Because the change in the deadlines is not effective
101 until October 1, 2025, pursuant to section 14 of this bill, the new deadlines apply initially to
102 the reports submitted in 2026.

39 paragraph.
40 (c) Donating land owned by the city or county to a nonprofit organization to be
41 used for [affordable] attainable housing.

1 (h) Providing money, support or density bonuses for [affordable] attainable
2 housing developments that are financed, wholly or in part, with low-income
3 housing tax credits, private activity bonds or money from a governmental entity for
4 [affordable] attainable housing, including, without limitation, money received
5 pursuant to 12 U.S.C. § 1701q and 42 U.S.C. § 8013.
6 (i) Providing financial incentives or density bonuses to promote appropriate
7 transit-oriented or multi-story housing developments that would include an

14 supportive housing needs to reside in [affordable] attainable housing in accordance
15 with a need for supportive housing identified in the 5-year consolidated plan
16 adopted by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development for
17 the city or county pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 12705 and described in 24 C.F.R. Part
18 91.
19 2. A governing body may reduce or subsidize impact fees, fees for the
20 issuance of building permits or fees imposed for the purpose for which an
21 enterprise fund was created to assist in maintaining or developing a project for
22 [affordable] attainable housing, pursuant to paragraph (a) of subsection 1, only if:
23 (a) When the incomes of all the residents of the project for [affordable]
24 attainable housing are averaged, the housing would be affordable on average for a
25 family with a total gross income that does not exceed 60 percent of the median
26 gross income for the county concerned based upon the estimates of the United
27 States Department of Housing and Urban Development of the most current median
28 gross family income for the county.
29 (b) The governing body has adopted an ordinance that establishes the criteria
30 that a project for [affordable] attainable housing must satisfy to receive assistance
31 in maintaining or developing the project for [affordable] attainable housing. Such
32 criteria must be designed to put into effect all relevant elements of the master plan
33 adopted by the governing body pursuant to NRS 278.150.
34 (c) The project for [affordable] attainable housing satisfies the criteria set forth
35 in the ordinance adopted pursuant to paragraph (b).
36 (d) The governing body makes a determination that reducing or subsidizing
37 such fees will not impair adversely the ability of the governing body to pay, when
38 due, all interest and principal on any outstanding bonds or any other obligations for
39 which revenue from such fees was pledged.
40 (e) The governing body holds a public hearing concerning the effect of the
41 reduction or subsidization of such fees on the economic viability of the general

43 of any affected enterprise fund.
44 3. On or before [July] March 15 of each year, the governing body shall
45 submit to the Housing Division of the Department of Business and Industry a
46 report, in the form prescribed by the Housing Division, of how the measures

PREFILED NOVEMBER 18, 2024
_______________
Referred to Committee on Government Affairs
SUMMARY—Revises provisions related to housing. (BDR 25-257)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to housing; renaming the position of Housing Advocate within
the Housing Division of the Department of Business and Industry as
the Housing Liaison; revising provisions relating to the statewide low-
income housing database maintained by the Division; revising
provisions relating to the Account for Affordable Housing; revising
provisions governing the tiers of affordable housing; revising
provisions relating to certain reports submitted to the Division by
certain local governments relating to affordable housing; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates the Housing Division in the Department of Business and Industry
2 and charges the Division, among other duties, with responsibility for increasing the
3 availability of decent, safe and sanitary housing for persons of low and moderate income in
4 this State. (NRS 232.510; chapter 319 of NRS) Existing law creates the position of Housing
5 Advocate within the Division and establishes the duties for the position, which include
6 providing information and assistance to persons who reside in affordable housing and
7 manufactured housing. (NRS 319.141) Section 1 of this bill renames the position of Housing
8 Advocate as the Housing Liaison.
9 Existing law requires the Division to create and maintain a statewide low-income housing
10 database. The database is required to include certain information relating to low-income
11 housing, including compilations and analysis of demographic, economic and housing data
12 from a variety of sources. (NRS 319.143) Section 2 of this bill requires the inclusion of any
13 survey conducted by the Division in the database. Section 2 also revises the data that is
14 required to be included in the database by: (1) changing the measure for determining the
15 number of households in various population groups experiencing high housing costs from 50
16 to 30 percent of household income; (2) increasing from 2 years to 3 years the length of the
17 planning period for identifying when subsidized units are forecast to convert to market-rate
18 units; and (3) adding information regarding certain multi-family residential housing. Section 2
19 further requires the Division, on or before December 31 of each year, to analyze the data in
20 the database and prepare and post on its website a report of its analysis.

Assembly Amendment No. 228 to Assembly Bill No. 37 Page 4
21 Existing law creates the Account for Affordable Housing in the State General Fund,
22 which is required to be administered by the Division, and prescribes the distribution and use
23 of money in the Account. (NRS 319.500, 319.510) Under existing law, the costs to create and
24 maintain the statewide low-income housing database are required to be paid from the Account
25 up to a maximum of $175,000 per year. (NRS 319.143, 319.510) Sections 2 and 3 of this bill:
26 (1) require payment from the Account of the costs to prepare the new annual report required
27 by section 2; and (2) change the maximum annual amount authorized from the Account for
28 the payment of costs related to the database from the fixed amount of $175,000 to not more
29 than 6 percent of the money deposited in the Account in each fiscal year.
30 Existing law also authorizes the Division to expend not more than $40,000 per year or an
31 amount equal to 6 percent of money received pursuant to the federal HOME Investment
32 Partnerships Act, whichever is greater, as reimbursement for administering the Account and
33 that federal money. (NRS 319.510; 42 U.S.C. §§ 12701 et seq.) Section 3: (1) eliminates the
34 authority of the Division to receive reimbursement from the Account for administering that
35 federal money; and (2) changes the maximum amount authorized from the Account as
36 reimbursement for administering the Account to not more than 6 percent of the money
37 deposited in the Account in each fiscal year.
38 Existing law requires the Division to distribute a certain portion of the remaining money
39 in the Account to the Division of Welfare and Supportive Services of the Department of
40 Health and Human Services for a program to provide emergency assistance to needy
41 families with children. (NRS 319.510) Section 3 eliminates this required distribution to
42 the Division for this program, but specifically authorizes the use of money in the
43 Account for the same purpose. With the elimination of this distribution to the Division,
44 all of the remaining money in the Account will effectively be distributed to the other
45 authorized recipients in existing law, which are certain charitable organizations, housing
46 authorities and local governments for the acquisition, construction and rehabilitation of
47 affordable housing for eligible families, subject to certain requirements. One such eligibility
48 requirement in existing law is that not less than 15 percent of the units acquired, constructed
49 or rehabilitated be affordable to persons whose income is at or below the federally designated
50 level signifying poverty. (NRS 319.510) Section 3: (1) changes the income level for that
51 requirement to at or below 30 percent of the median monthly gross household income for the
52 applicable county; and (2) clarifies that the money is authorized to be distributed to one or
53 more of the types of entities that are eligible recipients. Section 3 also eliminates the
54 eligibility requirement in existing law that a local government sponsor such a project.
55 Existing law establishes three tiers of affordable housing for various purposes in existing
56 law and defines “affordable housing” as housing that falls within any of the three tiers. (NRS
57 232.860, 244.189, 244.287, 268.058, 268.190, 278.0105, 279.385, 279A.020, 279B.020,
58 315.9625, 319.042) Under existing law, the tiers are based on both household income and the
59 costs of housing as a percentage of that income. With respect to household income: (1) “tier
60 one affordable housing” is housing for a household which has a total monthly gross income
61 that is equal to not more than 60 percent of the median monthly gross household income for
62 the county in which the housing is located, which is commonly known as the area median
63 household income; (2) “tier two affordable housing” is housing for a household which has a
64 total monthly gross income that is equal to more than 60 percent but not more than 80 percent
65 of the area median household income; and (3) “tier three affordable housing” is housing for a
66 household which has a total monthly gross income that is equal to more than 80 percent but
67 not more than 120 percent of the area median household income. In addition, with respect to
68 the costs of housing, affordable housing under existing law is housing that costs not more than
69 30 percent of the total monthly gross household income of the household with an income at
70 the maximum percentage of the area median household income for the tier. (NRS 278.01902,
71 278.01904, 278,01906) Section 4 of this bill creates a new tier of affordable housing, to be
72 known as “tier one affordable housing,” that addresses housing for a household that has a total
73 monthly gross income that is equal to not more than 30 percent of the area median household
74 income. As a result of the creation of this new tier of affordable housing, section 7 of this bill
75 renames “tier one affordable housing” in existing law as “tier two affordable housing” and
76 changes the percentage range for median income for that tier to more than 30 percent but not
77 more than 60 percent of the area median household income. Section 9 of this bill renames
78 “tier two affordable housing” in existing law, for which the percentage range for median
79 income is more than 60 percent but not more than 80 percent of the area median household

Assembly Amendment No. 228 to Assembly Bill No. 37 Page 5
80 income, as [“workforce] “tier three affordable housing.” Section 8 of this bill renames “tier
81 three affordable housing” in existing law, for which the percentage range for median income
82 is more than 80 percent but not more than 120 percent of the area median household income,
83 as [“attainable] “tier four affordable housing.” Section 4.5 of this bill creates another new
84 tier of affordable housing, to be known as “tier five affordable housing,” that addresses
85 housing for a household that has a total monthly gross income that is equal to more than
86 120 percent but not more than 150 percent of the area median household income.
87 Section 5 of this bill applies the newly defined [term] terms in [section] sections 4 and 4.5 to
88 the provisions of existing law relating to planning and zoning. [Sections 6 and] Section 11 of
89 this bill [make] makes conforming changes to existing law to reflect the new [tier.] tiers.
90 Section 6 of this bill renames “affordable housing” as “attainable housing” and
91 includes “tier four affordable housing” and “tier five affordable housing” within its
92 meaning. Sections 2 and 10 of this bill make conforming changes to reflect the new
93 name.
94 Existing law requires the governing body of certain cities or counties to submit to the
95 Division annual progress reports relating to affordable housing. (NRS 278.235) Existing law
96 requires: (1) the inclusion of these reports in the statewide low-income housing database; and
97 (2) the Division to compile and post these reports on its Internet website. (NRS 278.235,
98 319.143) Section 10 [of this bill] moves the deadline for: (1) the submission of the reports to
99 the Division from July 15 to March 15; and (2) the posting of the compilation of the reports by
