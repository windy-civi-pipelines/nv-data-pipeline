Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates the Housing Division in the Department of Business and
2 Industry and charges the Division, among other duties, with responsibility for
3 increasing the availability of decent, safe and sanitary housing for persons of low
4 and moderate income in this State. (NRS 232.510; chapter 319 of NRS) Existing
5 law creates the position of Housing Advocate within the Division and establishes
6 the duties for the position, which include providing information and assistance to
7 persons who reside in affordable housing and manufactured housing. (NRS
8 319.141) Section 1 of this bill renames the position of Housing Advocate as the
9 Housing Liaison.
10 Existing law requires the Division to create and maintain a statewide low-
11 income housing database. The database is required to include certain information
12 relating to low-income housing, including compilations and analysis of
-
*AB37_R1*
– 2 –
13 demographic, economic and housing data from a variety of sources. (NRS 319.143)
14 Section 2 of this bill requires the inclusion of any survey conducted by the Division
15 in the database. Section 2 also revises the data that is required to be included in the
16 database by: (1) changing the measure for determining the number of households in
17 various population groups experiencing high housing costs from 50 to 30 percent of
18 household income; (2) increasing from 2 years to 3 years the length of the planning
19 period for identifying when subsidized units are forecast to convert to market-rate
20 units; and (3) adding information regarding certain multi-family residential
21 housing. Section 2 further requires the Division, on or before December 31 of each
22 year, to analyze the data in the database and prepare and post on its website a report
23 of its analysis.
24 Existing law creates the Account for Affordable Housing in the State General
25 Fund, which is required to be administered by the Division, and prescribes the
26 distribution and use of money in the Account. (NRS 319.500, 319.510) Under
27 existing law, the costs to create and maintain the statewide low-income housing
28 database are required to be paid from the Account up to a maximum of $175,000
29 per year. (NRS 319.143, 319.510) Sections 2 and 3 of this bill: (1) require payment
30 from the Account of the costs to prepare the new annual report required by section
31 2; and (2) change the maximum annual amount authorized from the Account for the
32 payment of costs related to the database from the fixed amount of $175,000 to not
33 more than 6 percent of the money deposited in the Account in each fiscal year.
34 Existing law also authorizes the Division to expend not more than $40,000 per
35 year or an amount equal to 6 percent of money received pursuant to the federal
36 HOME Investment Partnerships Act, whichever is greater, as reimbursement for
37 administering the Account and that federal money. (NRS 319.510; 42 U.S.C. §§
38 12701 et seq.) Section 3: (1) eliminates the authority of the Division to receive
39 reimbursement from the Account for administering that federal money; and (2)
40 changes the maximum amount authorized from the Account as reimbursement for
41 administering the Account to not more than 6 percent of the money deposited in the
42 Account in each fiscal year.
43 Existing law requires the Division to distribute a certain portion of the
44 remaining money in the Account to the Division of Welfare and Supportive
45 Services of the Department of Health and Human Services for a program to provide
46 emergency assistance to needy families with children. (NRS 319.510) Section 3
47 eliminates this required distribution to the Division for this program, but
48 specifically authorizes the use of money in the Account for the same purpose. With
49 the elimination of this distribution to the Division, all of the remaining money in
50 the Account will effectively be distributed to the other authorized recipients in
51 existing law, which are certain charitable organizations, housing authorities and
52 local governments for the acquisition, construction and rehabilitation of affordable
53 housing for eligible families, subject to certain requirements. One such eligibility
54 requirement in existing law is that not less than 15 percent of the units acquired,
55 constructed or rehabilitated be affordable to persons whose income is at or below
56 the federally designated level signifying poverty. (NRS 319.510) Section 3: (1)
57 changes the income level for that requirement to at or below 30 percent of the
58 median monthly gross household income for the applicable county; and (2) clarifies
59 that the money is authorized to be distributed to one or more of the types of entities
60 that are eligible recipients. Section 3 also eliminates the eligibility requirement in
61 existing law that a local government sponsor such a project.
62 Existing law establishes three tiers of affordable housing for various purposes
63 in existing law and defines “affordable housing” as housing that falls within any of
64 the three tiers. (NRS 232.860, 244.189, 244.287, 268.058, 268.190, 278.0105,
65 279.385, 279A.020, 279B.020, 315.9625, 319.042) Under existing law, the tiers are
66 based on both household income and the costs of housing as a percentage of that
67 income. With respect to household income: (1) “tier one affordable housing” is
-
*AB37_R1*
– 3 –
68 housing for a household which has a total monthly gross income that is equal to not
69 more than 60 percent of the median monthly gross household income for the county
70 in which the housing is located, which is commonly known as the area median
71 household income; (2) “tier two affordable housing” is housing for a household
72 which has a total monthly gross income that is equal to more than 60 percent but
73 not more than 80 percent of the area median household income; and (3) “tier three
74 affordable housing” is housing for a household which has a total monthly gross
75 income that is equal to more than 80 percent but not more than 120 percent of the
76 area median household income. In addition, with respect to the costs of housing,
77 affordable housing under existing law is housing that costs not more than 30
78 percent of the total monthly gross household income of the household with an
79 income at the maximum percentage of the area median household income for the
80 tier. (NRS 278.01902, 278.01904, 278,01906) Section 4 of this bill creates a new
81 tier of affordable housing, to be known as “tier one affordable housing,” that
82 addresses housing for a household that has a total monthly gross income that is
83 equal to not more than 30 percent of the area median household income. As a result
84 of the creation of this new tier of affordable housing, section 7 of this bill renames
85 “tier one affordable housing” in existing law as “tier two affordable housing” and
86 changes the percentage range for median income for that tier to more than 30
87 percent but not more than 60 percent of the area median household income. Section
88 9 of this bill renames “tier two affordable housing” in existing law, for which the
89 percentage range for median income is more than 60 percent but not more than 80
90 percent of the area median household income, as “tier three affordable housing.”
91 Section 8 of this bill renames “tier three affordable housing” in existing law, for
92 which the percentage range for median income is more than 80 percent but not
93 more than 120 percent of the area median household income, as “tier four
94 affordable housing.” Section 4.5 of this bill creates another new tier of affordable
95 housing, to be known as “tier five affordable housing,” that addresses housing for a
96 household that has a total monthly gross income that is equal to more than 120
97 percent but not more than 150 percent of the area median household income.
98 Section 5 of this bill applies the newly defined terms in sections 4 and 4.5 to the
99 provisions of existing law relating to planning and zoning. Section 11 of this bill
100 makes conforming changes to existing law to reflect the new tiers.
101 Section 6 of this bill renames “affordable housing” as “attainable housing” and
102 includes “tier four affordable housing” and “tier five affordable housing” within its
103 meaning. Sections 2 and 10 of this bill make conforming changes to reflect the
104 new name.
105 Existing law requires the governing body of certain cities or counties to submit
106 to the Division annual progress reports relating to affordable housing. (NRS
107 278.235) Existing law requires: (1) the inclusion of these reports in the statewide
108 low-income housing database; and (2) the Division to compile and post these
109 reports on its Internet website. (NRS 278.235, 319.143) Section 10 moves the
110 deadline for: (1) the submission of the reports to the Division from
111 July 15 to March 15; and (2) the posting of the compilation of the reports by the
112 Division from August 15 to April 15. Because the change in the deadlines is not
113 effective until October 1, 2025, pursuant to section 14 of this bill, the new
114 deadlines apply initially to the reports submitted in 2026.

– 12 –
1 or county pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 12705 and described in 24 C.F.R.
2 Part 91.
3 2. A governing body may reduce or subsidize impact fees, fees
4 for the issuance of building permits or fees imposed for the purpose
5 for which an enterprise fund was created to assist in maintaining or
6 developing a project for [affordable] attainable housing, pursuant to
7 paragraph (a) of subsection 1, only if:
8 (a) When the incomes of all the residents of the project for
9 [affordable] attainable housing are averaged, the housing would be
10 affordable on average for a family with a total gross income that
11 does not exceed 60 percent of the median gross income for the
12 county concerned based upon the estimates of the United States
13 Department of Housing and Urban Development of the most current
14 median gross family income for the county.
15 (b) The governing body has adopted an ordinance that
16 establishes the criteria that a project for [affordable] attainable
17 housing must satisfy to receive assistance in maintaining or
18 developing the project for [affordable] attainable housing. Such
19 criteria must be designed to put into effect all relevant elements of
20 the master plan adopted by the governing body pursuant to
21 NRS 278.150.
22 (c) The project for [affordable] attainable housing satisfies the
23 criteria set forth in the ordinance adopted pursuant to paragraph (b).

28 such fees was pledged.
29 (e) The governing body holds a public hearing concerning the
30 effect of the reduction or subsidization of such fees on the economic
31 viability of the general fund of the city or county, as applicable, and,
32 if applicable, the economic viability of any affected enterprise fund.
33 3. On or before [July] March 15 of each year, the governing

39 community for the preceding year. The report must include an
40 analysis of the need for [affordable] attainable housing within the

FIRST REPRINT A.B. 37
ASSEMBLY BILL NO. 37–COMMITTEE
ON GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS
(ON BEHALF OF THE HOUSING DIVISION OF THE
DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY)
PREFILED NOVEMBER 18, 2024
____________
Referred to Committee on Government Affairs
SUMMARY—Revises provisions related to housing.
(BDR 25-257)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to housing; renaming the position of Housing
Advocate within the Housing Division of the Department
of Business and Industry as the Housing Liaison; revising
provisions relating to the statewide low-income housing
database maintained by the Division; revising provisions
relating to the Account for Affordable Housing; revising
provisions governing the tiers of affordable housing;
revising provisions relating to certain reports submitted to
the Division by certain local governments relating to
affordable housing; and providing other matters properly
relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates the Housing Division in the Department of Business and
2 Industry and charges the Division, among other duties, with responsibility for
3 increasing the availability of decent, safe and sanitary housing for persons of low
4 and moderate income in this State. (NRS 232.510; chapter 319 of NRS) Existing
5 law creates the position of Housing Advocate within the Division and establishes
6 the duties for the position, which include providing information and assistance to
7 persons who reside in affordable housing and manufactured housing. (NRS
8 319.141) Section 1 of this bill renames the position of Housing Advocate as the
9 Housing Liaison.
10 Existing law requires the Division to create and maintain a statewide low-
11 income housing database. The database is required to include certain information
12 relating to low-income housing, including compilations and analysis of
-
*AB37_R1*

– 2 –
13 demographic, economic and housing data from a variety of sources. (NRS 319.143)
14 Section 2 of this bill requires the inclusion of any survey conducted by the Division
15 in the database. Section 2 also revises the data that is required to be included in the
16 database by: (1) changing the measure for determining the number of households in
17 various population groups experiencing high housing costs from 50 to 30 percent of
18 household income; (2) increasing from 2 years to 3 years the length of the planning
19 period for identifying when subsidized units are forecast to convert to market-rate
20 units; and (3) adding information regarding certain multi-family residential
21 housing. Section 2 further requires the Division, on or before December 31 of each
22 year, to analyze the data in the database and prepare and post on its website a report
23 of its analysis.
24 Existing law creates the Account for Affordable Housing in the State General
25 Fund, which is required to be administered by the Division, and prescribes the
26 distribution and use of money in the Account. (NRS 319.500, 319.510) Under
27 existing law, the costs to create and maintain the statewide low-income housing
28 database are required to be paid from the Account up to a maximum of $175,000
29 per year. (NRS 319.143, 319.510) Sections 2 and 3 of this bill: (1) require payment
30 from the Account of the costs to prepare the new annual report required by section
31 2; and (2) change the maximum annual amount authorized from the Account for the
32 payment of costs related to the database from the fixed amount of $175,000 to not
33 more than 6 percent of the money deposited in the Account in each fiscal year.
34 Existing law also authorizes the Division to expend not more than $40,000 per
35 year or an amount equal to 6 percent of money received pursuant to the federal
36 HOME Investment Partnerships Act, whichever is greater, as reimbursement for
37 administering the Account and that federal money. (NRS 319.510; 42 U.S.C. §§
38 12701 et seq.) Section 3: (1) eliminates the authority of the Division to receive
39 reimbursement from the Account for administering that federal money; and (2)
40 changes the maximum amount authorized from the Account as reimbursement for
41 administering the Account to not more than 6 percent of the money deposited in the
42 Account in each fiscal year.
43 Existing law requires the Division to distribute a certain portion of the
44 remaining money in the Account to the Division of Welfare and Supportive
45 Services of the Department of Health and Human Services for a program to provide
46 emergency assistance to needy families with children. (NRS 319.510) Section 3
47 eliminates this required distribution to the Division for this program, but
48 specifically authorizes the use of money in the Account for the same purpose. With
49 the elimination of this distribution to the Division, all of the remaining money in
50 the Account will effectively be distributed to the other authorized recipients in
51 existing law, which are certain charitable organizations, housing authorities and
52 local governments for the acquisition, construction and rehabilitation of affordable
53 housing for eligible families, subject to certain requirements. One such eligibility
54 requirement in existing law is that not less than 15 percent of the units acquired,
55 constructed or rehabilitated be affordable to persons whose income is at or below
56 the federally designated level signifying poverty. (NRS 319.510) Section 3: (1)
57 changes the income level for that requirement to at or below 30 percent of the
58 median monthly gross household income for the applicable county; and (2) clarifies
59 that the money is authorized to be distributed to one or more of the types of entities
60 that are eligible recipients. Section 3 also eliminates the eligibility requirement in
61 existing law that a local government sponsor such a project.
62 Existing law establishes three tiers of affordable housing for various purposes
63 in existing law and defines “affordable housing” as housing that falls within any of
64 the three tiers. (NRS 232.860, 244.189, 244.287, 268.058, 268.190, 278.0105,
65 279.385, 279A.020, 279B.020, 315.9625, 319.042) Under existing law, the tiers are
66 based on both household income and the costs of housing as a percentage of that
67 income. With respect to household income: (1) “tier one affordable housing” is
-
*AB37_R1*

– 3 –
68 housing for a household which has a total monthly gross income that is equal to not
69 more than 60 percent of the median monthly gross household income for the county
70 in which the housing is located, which is commonly known as the area median
71 household income; (2) “tier two affordable housing” is housing for a household
72 which has a total monthly gross income that is equal to more than 60 percent but
73 not more than 80 percent of the area median household income; and (3) “tier three
74 affordable housing” is housing for a household which has a total monthly gross
75 income that is equal to more than 80 percent but not more than 120 percent of the
76 area median household income. In addition, with respect to the costs of housing,
77 affordable housing under existing law is housing that costs not more than 30
78 percent of the total monthly gross household income of the household with an
79 income at the maximum percentage of the area median household income for the
80 tier. (NRS 278.01902, 278.01904, 278,01906) Section 4 of this bill creates a new
81 tier of affordable housing, to be known as “tier one affordable housing,” that
82 addresses housing for a household that has a total monthly gross income that is
83 equal to not more than 30 percent of the area median household income. As a result
84 of the creation of this new tier of affordable housing, section 7 of this bill renames
85 “tier one affordable housing” in existing law as “tier two affordable housing” and
86 changes the percentage range for median income for that tier to more than 30
87 percent but not more than 60 percent of the area median household income. Section
88 9 of this bill renames “tier two affordable housing” in existing law, for which the
89 percentage range for median income is more than 60 percent but not more than 80
90 percent of the area median household income, as “tier three affordable housing.”
91 Section 8 of this bill renames “tier three affordable housing” in existing law, for
92 which the percentage range for median income is more than 80 percent but not
93 more than 120 percent of the area median household income, as “tier four
94 affordable housing.” Section 4.5 of this bill creates another new tier of affordable
95 housing, to be known as “tier five affordable housing,” that addresses housing for a
96 household that has a total monthly gross income that is equal to more than 120
97 percent but not more than 150 percent of the area median household income.
98 Section 5 of this bill applies the newly defined terms in sections 4 and 4.5 to the
99 provisions of existing law relating to planning and zoning. Section 11 of this bill
100 makes conforming changes to existing law to reflect the new tiers.
101 Section 6 of this bill renames “affordable housing” as “attainable housing” and
102 includes “tier four affordable housing” and “tier five affordable housing” within its
103 meaning. Sections 2 and 10 of this bill make conforming changes to reflect the
104 new name.
105 Existing law requires the governing body of certain cities or counties to submit
106 to the Division annual progress reports relating to affordable housing. (NRS
107 278.235) Existing law requires: (1) the inclusion of these reports in the statewide
108 low-income housing database; and (2) the Division to compile and post these
109 reports on its Internet website. (NRS 278.235, 319.143) Section 10 moves the
110 deadline for: (1) the submission of the reports to the Division from
111 July 15 to March 15; and (2) the posting of the compilation of the reports by the
112 Division from August 15 to April 15. Because the change in the deadlines is not
113 effective until October 1, 2025, pursuant to section 14 of this bill, the new
114 deadlines apply initially to the reports submitted in 2026.
