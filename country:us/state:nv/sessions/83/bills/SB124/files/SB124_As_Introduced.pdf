EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; providing for the limited licensure
of certain foreign physicians; prescribing the conditions
under which such a limited licensee is authorized to
practice medicine; providing for the unrestricted licensure
of certain limited licensees; updating certain references;
and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensing of physicians by the Board of Medical
2 Examiners. (NRS 630.160-630.1607, 630.258-630.2665) Existing law also
3 authorizes a graduate of a foreign medical school to obtain a restricted license to
4 teach, research or practice medicine at a medical facility, medical research facility
5 or medical school by completing certain requirements that are less stringent than
6 the requirements to obtain an unrestricted license. (NRS 630.2645) If the holder of
7 such a restricted license wishes to obtain an unrestricted license, existing law
8 requires the holder to meet all of the qualifications ordinarily required to obtain an
9 unrestricted license. (NRS 630.160, 630.2645)
10 Section 1 of this bill authorizes the Board of Medical Examiners to issue a
11 limited license to practice medicine to a graduate of a qualified foreign medical
12 school who: (1) holds a valid and unrestricted license to practice medicine issued
13 by a foreign country other than Canada; (2) has completed a residency program or
14 has performed the duties of a physician in that foreign country within a certain
15 amount of time before applying for the license; and (3) possesses certain other
16 qualifications related to the practice of medicine. Section 1 requires that the holder
17 of a limited license only practice medicine in a facility that has a residency program
18 approved by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education. Section 1
-
*SB124*

– 2 –
19 requires the Board of Medical Examiners to issue an unrestricted license to the
20 holder of a limited license who: (1) has completed at least 2 years of practice as a
21 full-time physician under the limited license; and (2) remains in good standing.
22 Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to clarify that an applicant for
23 a limited license to practice medicine pursuant to section 1 is not required to
24 possess the same qualifications as an applicant for a standard license. Sections 3-6
25 of this bill update references to certification by the Educational Commission for
26 Foreign Medical Graduates in existing law to reflect the current practices of the
27 Commission.
