CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to health care; providing for the limited licensure
of certain foreign physicians; prescribing the conditions
under which such a limited licensee is authorized to practice
medicine; providing for the unrestricted licensure of certain
limited licensees; requiring the Board of Medical Examiners
to submit certain reports to the Legislature; updating certain
references; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law provides for the licensing of physicians by the Board of Medical
Examiners. (NRS 630.160-630.1607, 630.258-630.2665) Existing law also
authorizes a graduate of a foreign medical school to obtain a restricted license to
teach, research or practice medicine at a medical facility, medical research facility
or medical school by completing certain requirements that are less stringent than
the requirements to obtain an unrestricted license. (NRS 630.2645) If the holder of
such a restricted license wishes to obtain an unrestricted license, existing law
requires the holder to meet all of the qualifications ordinarily required to obtain an
unrestricted license. (NRS 630.160, 630.2645)

Section 2:
Section 1.3 of this bill authorizes the Board of Medical Examiners to issue a
limited license to practice medicine to a graduate of a qualified foreign medical
school who holds or has held a valid and unrestricted license to practice medicine
issued by a foreign country other than Canada and: (1) has completed a residency
program or other program of postgraduate training or has performed the duties of a
physician in that foreign country within a certain amount of time before applying
for the license; and (2) possesses certain other qualifications related to the practice
of medicine. Section 1.3 authorizes the Board to additionally require an applicant
for a limited license to: (1) take an additional examination if the applicant has not
performed the duties of physician for a continuous period of 24 months before
applying for licensure; or (2) submit to the Board an offer of employment from
certain health related entities. Section 1.3 requires that the holder of a limited
license only practice medicine: (1) under the supervision of at least one physician
who holds an active unrestricted license and possesses certain additional
qualifications and with whom the holder of a limited license has entered into a
written practice agreement; and (2) in accordance with the written practice
agreement. Section 1.3 authorizes the Board of Medical Examiners to issue an
unrestricted license to the holder of a limited license who: (1) has completed at
least 2 years of practice as a full-time physician under the limited license; (2)
remains in good standing; and (3) has received a recommendation from each
physician currently supervising him or her. Section 1.3 additionally authorizes the
Board to establish other requirements relating to the licensure and practice of
limited licensees. Section 1.7 of this bill requires the Board to annually submit to
the Legislature a report concerning the licensure of graduates of foreign medical
schools under the provisions of section 1.3.

Section 3:
Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to clarify that an applicant for
a limited license to practice medicine pursuant to section 1.3 is not required to
possess the same qualifications as an applicant for a standard license. Sections 3-6
of this bill update references to certification by the Educational Commission for
Foreign Medical Graduates in existing law to reflect the current practices of the
Commission.

Raw Text:
Senate Bill No. 124–Senators Doñate;
Flores, Stone and Taylor
Joint Sponsor: Assemblymember González
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to health care; providing for the limited licensure
of certain foreign physicians; prescribing the conditions
under which such a limited licensee is authorized to practice
medicine; providing for the unrestricted licensure of certain
limited licensees; requiring the Board of Medical Examiners
to submit certain reports to the Legislature; updating certain
references; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law provides for the licensing of physicians by the Board of Medical
Examiners. (NRS 630.160-630.1607, 630.258-630.2665) Existing law also
authorizes a graduate of a foreign medical school to obtain a restricted license to
teach, research or practice medicine at a medical facility, medical research facility
or medical school by completing certain requirements that are less stringent than
the requirements to obtain an unrestricted license. (NRS 630.2645) If the holder of
such a restricted license wishes to obtain an unrestricted license, existing law
requires the holder to meet all of the qualifications ordinarily required to obtain an
unrestricted license. (NRS 630.160, 630.2645)
Section 1.3 of this bill authorizes the Board of Medical Examiners to issue a
limited license to practice medicine to a graduate of a qualified foreign medical
school who holds or has held a valid and unrestricted license to practice medicine
issued by a foreign country other than Canada and: (1) has completed a residency
program or other program of postgraduate training or has performed the duties of a
physician in that foreign country within a certain amount of time before applying
for the license; and (2) possesses certain other qualifications related to the practice
of medicine. Section 1.3 authorizes the Board to additionally require an applicant
for a limited license to: (1) take an additional examination if the applicant has not
performed the duties of physician for a continuous period of 24 months before
applying for licensure; or (2) submit to the Board an offer of employment from
certain health related entities. Section 1.3 requires that the holder of a limited
license only practice medicine: (1) under the supervision of at least one physician
who holds an active unrestricted license and possesses certain additional
qualifications and with whom the holder of a limited license has entered into a
written practice agreement; and (2) in accordance with the written practice
agreement. Section 1.3 authorizes the Board of Medical Examiners to issue an
unrestricted license to the holder of a limited license who: (1) has completed at
least 2 years of practice as a full-time physician under the limited license; (2)
remains in good standing; and (3) has received a recommendation from each
physician currently supervising him or her. Section 1.3 additionally authorizes the
Board to establish other requirements relating to the licensure and practice of
limited licensees. Section 1.7 of this bill requires the Board to annually submit to
the Legislature a report concerning the licensure of graduates of foreign medical
schools under the provisions of section 1.3.
-
83rd Session (2025)

– 2 –
Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to clarify that an applicant for
a limited license to practice medicine pursuant to section 1.3 is not required to
possess the same qualifications as an applicant for a standard license. Sections 3-6
of this bill update references to certification by the Educational Commission for
Foreign Medical Graduates in existing law to reflect the current practices of the
Commission.
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
