EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; providing for the limited licensure
of certain foreign physicians; prescribing the conditions
under which such a limited licensee is authorized to
practice medicine; providing for the unrestricted licensure
of certain limited licensees; requiring the Board of
Medical Examiners to submit certain reports to the
Legislature; updating certain references; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensing of physicians by the Board of Medical
2 Examiners. (NRS 630.160-630.1607, 630.258-630.2665) Existing law also
3 authorizes a graduate of a foreign medical school to obtain a restricted license to
4 teach, research or practice medicine at a medical facility, medical research facility
5 or medical school by completing certain requirements that are less stringent than
6 the requirements to obtain an unrestricted license. (NRS 630.2645) If the holder of
7 such a restricted license wishes to obtain an unrestricted license, existing law
8 requires the holder to meet all of the qualifications ordinarily required to obtain an
9 unrestricted license. (NRS 630.160, 630.2645)
10 Section 1.3 of this bill authorizes the Board of Medical Examiners to issue a
11 limited license to practice medicine to a graduate of a qualified foreign medical
12 school who holds or has held a valid and unrestricted license to practice medicine
13 issued by a foreign country other than Canada and: (1) has completed a residency
-
*SB124_R1*

– 2 –
14 program or other program of postgraduate training or has performed the duties of a
15 physician in that foreign country within a certain amount of time before applying
16 for the license; and (2) possesses certain other qualifications related to the practice
17 of medicine. Section 1.3 authorizes the Board to additionally require an applicant
18 for a limited license to: (1) take an additional examination if the applicant has not
19 performed the duties of physician for a continuous period of 24 months before
20 applying for licensure; or (2) submit to the Board an offer of employment from
21 certain health related entities. Section 1.3 requires that the holder of a limited
22 license only practice medicine: (1) under the supervision of at least one physician
23 who holds an active unrestricted license and possesses certain additional
24 qualifications and with whom the holder of a limited license has entered into a
25 written practice agreement; and (2) in accordance with the written practice
26 agreement. Section 1.3 authorizes the Board of Medical Examiners to issue an
27 unrestricted license to the holder of a limited license who: (1) has completed at
28 least 2 years of practice as a full-time physician under the limited license; (2)
29 remains in good standing; and (3) has received a recommendation from each
30 physician currently supervising him or her. Section 1.3 additionally authorizes the
31 Board to establish other requirements relating to the licensure and practice of
32 limited licensees. Section 1.7 of this bill requires the Board to annually submit to
33 the Legislature a report concerning the licensure of graduates of foreign medical
34 schools under the provisions of section 1.3.
35 Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to clarify that an applicant for
36 a limited license to practice medicine pursuant to section 1.3 is not required to
37 possess the same qualifications as an applicant for a standard license. Sections 3-6
38 of this bill update references to certification by the Educational Commission for
39 Foreign Medical Graduates in existing law to reflect the current practices of the
40 Commission.
