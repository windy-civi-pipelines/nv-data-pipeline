AN ACT relating to health care; providing for the limited licensure of certain
foreign physicians; prescribing the conditions under which such a
limited licensee is authorized to practice medicine; providing for the
unrestricted licensure of certain limited licensees; requiring the
Board of Medical Examiners to submit certain reports to the
Legislature; updating certain references; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensing of physicians by the Board of Medical Examiners.
2 (NRS 630.160-630.1607, 630.258-630.2665) Existing law also authorizes a graduate of a
3 foreign medical school to obtain a restricted license to teach, research or practice medicine at
4 a medical facility, medical research facility or medical school by completing certain
5 requirements that are less stringent than the requirements to obtain an unrestricted license.
6 (NRS 630.2645) If the holder of such a restricted license wishes to obtain an unrestricted
7 license, existing law requires the holder to meet all of the qualifications ordinarily required to
8 obtain an unrestricted license. (NRS 630.160, 630.2645)
9 Section [1] 1.3 of this bill authorizes the Board of Medical Examiners to issue a limited
10 license to practice medicine to a graduate of a qualified foreign medical school who [: (1)]
11 holds or has held a valid and unrestricted license to practice medicine issued by a foreign
12 country other than Canada [; (2)] and: (1) has completed a residency program or other
13 program of postgraduate training or has performed the duties of a physician in that foreign
14 country within a certain amount of time before applying for the license; and [(3)] (2)
15 possesses certain other qualifications related to the practice of medicine. Section 1.3
16 authorizes the Board to additionally require an applicant for a limited license to: (1) take
17 an additional examination if the applicant has not performed the duties of physician for
18 a continuous period of 24 months before applying for licensure; or (2) submit to the
19 Board an offer of employment from certain health related entities. Section [1] 1.3
20 requires that the holder of a limited license only practice medicine [in a facility that has a
21 residency program approved by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education.] :
22 (1) under the supervision of at least one physician who holds an active unrestricted
23 license and possesses certain additional qualifications and with whom the holder of a
24 limited license has entered into a written practice agreement; and (2) in accordance with
Senate Amendment No. 300 to Senate Bill No. 124 Page 4
25 the written practice agreement. Section [1 requires] 1.3 authorizes the Board of Medical
26 Examiners to issue an unrestricted license to the holder of a limited license who: (1) has
27 completed at least 2 years of practice as a full-time physician under the limited license; [and]
28 (2) remains in good standing [.] ; and (3) has received a recommendation from each
29 physician currently supervising him or her. Section 1.3 additionally authorizes the
30 Board to establish other requirements relating to the licensure and practice of limited
31 licensees. Section 1.7 of this bill requires the Board to annually submit to the Legislature
32 a report concerning the licensure of graduates of foreign medical schools under the
33 provisions of section 1.3.
34 Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to clarify that an applicant for a limited
35 license to practice medicine pursuant to section [1] 1.3 is not required to possess the same
36 qualifications as an applicant for a standard license. Sections 3-6 of this bill update references
37 to certification by the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates in existing law
38 to reflect the current practices of the Commission.

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; providing for the limited licensure of certain
foreign physicians; prescribing the conditions under which such a
limited licensee is authorized to practice medicine; providing for the
unrestricted licensure of certain limited licensees; requiring the
Board of Medical Examiners to submit certain reports to the
Legislature; updating certain references; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law provides for the licensing of physicians by the Board of Medical Examiners.
2 (NRS 630.160-630.1607, 630.258-630.2665) Existing law also authorizes a graduate of a
3 foreign medical school to obtain a restricted license to teach, research or practice medicine at
4 a medical facility, medical research facility or medical school by completing certain
5 requirements that are less stringent than the requirements to obtain an unrestricted license.
6 (NRS 630.2645) If the holder of such a restricted license wishes to obtain an unrestricted
7 license, existing law requires the holder to meet all of the qualifications ordinarily required to
8 obtain an unrestricted license. (NRS 630.160, 630.2645)
9 Section [1] 1.3 of this bill authorizes the Board of Medical Examiners to issue a limited
10 license to practice medicine to a graduate of a qualified foreign medical school who [: (1)]
11 holds or has held a valid and unrestricted license to practice medicine issued by a foreign
12 country other than Canada [; (2)] and: (1) has completed a residency program or other
13 program of postgraduate training or has performed the duties of a physician in that foreign
14 country within a certain amount of time before applying for the license; and [(3)] (2)
15 possesses certain other qualifications related to the practice of medicine. Section 1.3
16 authorizes the Board to additionally require an applicant for a limited license to: (1) take
17 an additional examination if the applicant has not performed the duties of physician for
18 a continuous period of 24 months before applying for licensure; or (2) submit to the
19 Board an offer of employment from certain health related entities. Section [1] 1.3
20 requires that the holder of a limited license only practice medicine [in a facility that has a
21 residency program approved by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education.] :
22 (1) under the supervision of at least one physician who holds an active unrestricted
23 license and possesses certain additional qualifications and with whom the holder of a
24 limited license has entered into a written practice agreement; and (2) in accordance with

Senate Amendment No. 300 to Senate Bill No. 124 Page 4
25 the written practice agreement. Section [1 requires] 1.3 authorizes the Board of Medical
26 Examiners to issue an unrestricted license to the holder of a limited license who: (1) has
27 completed at least 2 years of practice as a full-time physician under the limited license; [and]
28 (2) remains in good standing [.] ; and (3) has received a recommendation from each
29 physician currently supervising him or her. Section 1.3 additionally authorizes the
30 Board to establish other requirements relating to the licensure and practice of limited
31 licensees. Section 1.7 of this bill requires the Board to annually submit to the Legislature
32 a report concerning the licensure of graduates of foreign medical schools under the
33 provisions of section 1.3.
34 Section 2 of this bill makes a conforming change to clarify that an applicant for a limited
35 license to practice medicine pursuant to section [1] 1.3 is not required to possess the same
36 qualifications as an applicant for a standard license. Sections 3-6 of this bill update references
37 to certification by the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates in existing law
38 to reflect the current practices of the Commission.
