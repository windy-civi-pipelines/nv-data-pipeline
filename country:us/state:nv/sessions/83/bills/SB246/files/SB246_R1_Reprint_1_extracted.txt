EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to insurance; requiring certain health plans to
authorize a woman covered by such a plan to obtain
covered gynecological or obstetrical services without first
receiving authorization or a referral from her primary care
physician; requiring such health plans to authorize a
woman covered by such a plan to designate an
obstetrician or gynecologist as her primary care physician
under certain circumstances; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires certain public and private health insurance plans to
2 include a provision authorizing a woman covered by such a plan to obtain covered
3 gynecological or obstetrical services without first receiving authorization from the
4 insurer or a referral from her primary care physician. (NRS 287.010, 687B.225,
5 689A.0413, 689B.031, 695B.1914, 695C.1713) Sections 1-6, 8 and 9 of this bill
6 apply this requirement to: (1) health plans that provide medical care to certain
7 private-sector employees of small employers and their dependents; (2) benefit
8 contracts issued by fraternal benefit societies; (3) managed care organizations; (4)
9 the Public Employees’ Benefits Program; and (5) Medicaid. Sections 1.3-6, 8 and
10 9 require all public and private health insurance plans which are subject to this
11 requirement to additionally authorize a woman covered by the plan to designate as
12 her primary care physician an obstetrician or gynecologist who meets certain
13 criteria.

PAZINA, TAYLOR; DALY, FLORES, NGUYEN AND SCHEIBLE
FEBRUARY 26, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Commerce and Labor
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to health insurance
coverage for gynecological or obstetrical services.
(BDR 57-205)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.
Effect on the State: Yes.
CONTAINS UNFUNDED MANDATE (§ 1.7 & NRS 287.010)
(NOT REQUESTED BY AFFECTED LOCAL GOVERNMENT)
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to insurance; requiring certain health plans to
authorize a woman covered by such a plan to obtain
covered gynecological or obstetrical services without first
receiving authorization or a referral from her primary care
physician; requiring such health plans to authorize a
woman covered by such a plan to designate an
obstetrician or gynecologist as her primary care physician
under certain circumstances; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires certain public and private health insurance plans to
2 include a provision authorizing a woman covered by such a plan to obtain covered
3 gynecological or obstetrical services without first receiving authorization from the
4 insurer or a referral from her primary care physician. (NRS 287.010, 687B.225,
5 689A.0413, 689B.031, 695B.1914, 695C.1713) Sections 1-6, 8 and 9 of this bill
6 apply this requirement to: (1) health plans that provide medical care to certain
7 private-sector employees of small employers and their dependents; (2) benefit
8 contracts issued by fraternal benefit societies; (3) managed care organizations; (4)
9 the Public Employees’ Benefits Program; and (5) Medicaid. Sections 1.3-6, 8 and
10 9 require all public and private health insurance plans which are subject to this
11 requirement to additionally authorize a woman covered by the plan to designate as
12 her primary care physician an obstetrician or gynecologist who meets certain
13 criteria.
