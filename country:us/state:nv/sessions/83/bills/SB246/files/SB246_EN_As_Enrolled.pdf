Taylor; Daly, Flores, Nguyen and Scheible
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to insurance; requiring certain health plans to
authorize a woman covered by such a plan to obtain covered
gynecological or obstetrical services without first receiving
authorization or a referral from her primary care physician;
requiring such health plans to authorize a woman covered by
such a plan to designate an obstetrician or gynecologist as her
primary care physician under certain circumstances; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law requires certain public and private health insurance plans to
include a provision authorizing a woman covered by such a plan to obtain covered
gynecological or obstetrical services without first receiving authorization from the
insurer or a referral from her primary care physician. (NRS 287.010, 687B.225,
689A.0413, 689B.031, 695B.1914, 695C.1713) Sections 1-6, 8 and 9 of this bill
apply this requirement to: (1) health plans that provide medical care to certain
private-sector employees of small employers and their dependents; (2) benefit
contracts issued by fraternal benefit societies; (3) managed care organizations; (4)
the Public Employees’ Benefits Program; and (5) Medicaid. Sections 1.3-6, 8 and
9 require all public and private health insurance plans which are subject to this
requirement to additionally authorize a woman covered by the plan to designate as
her primary care physician an obstetrician or gynecologist who meets certain
criteria.
Section 7 of this bill makes a conforming change to require the Director of the
Department of Health and Human Services to administer the provisions of section
9 in the same manner as other requirements governing Medicaid.
