EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to insurance; requiring certain health plans to authorize a woman
covered by such a plan to obtain covered gynecological or obstetrical
services without first receiving authorization or a referral from her
primary care physician; requiring such health plans to authorize a
woman covered by such a plan to designate an obstetrician or
gynecologist as her primary care physician under certain
circumstances; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires certain public and private health insurance plans to include a
2 provision authorizing a woman covered by such a plan to obtain covered gynecological or
3 obstetrical services without first receiving authorization from the insurer or a referral from her
4 primary care physician. (NRS 287.010, 687B.225, 689A.0413, 689B.031, 695B.1914,
5 695C.1713) Sections 1-6, 8 and 9 of this bill apply this requirement to: (1) health plans that
6 provide medical care to certain private-sector employees of small employers and their
7 dependents; (2) benefit contracts issued by fraternal benefit societies; (3) managed care
8 organizations; (4) the Public Employees’ Benefits Program; and (5) Medicaid. Sections 1.3-6,
9 8 and 9 require all public and private health insurance plans which are subject to this
10 requirement to additionally authorize a woman covered by the plan to designate as her
11 primary care physician an obstetrician or gynecologist who meets certain criteria.
12 Section 7 of this bill makes a conforming change to require the Director of the
13 Department of Health and Human Services to administer the provisions of section 9 in the
14 same manner as other requirements governing Medicaid.

19 (a) Obtain covered gynecological or obstetrical services without first

21 (b) Designate as her primary care physician an obstetrician or gynecologist
22 who:
23 (1) Satisfies the criteria established by the Department for designation as
24 a primary care provider under Medicaid; and

28 a woman who is a recipient of Medicaid to designate an obstetrician or
29 gynecologist as her primary care physician.
