EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to taxation; eliminating the excise taxes on
wholesale sales of cannabis; increasing the amount of the
excise tax on retail sales of cannabis and cannabis
products; revising the manner in which the revenues from
the excise tax on retail sales of cannabis and cannabis
products must be distributed; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law imposes an excise tax upon the first wholesale sale of cannabis by
2 a medical cannabis cultivation facility or an adult-use cannabis cultivation facility
3 to another cannabis establishment at the rate of 15 percent of: (1) the fair market
4 value at wholesale for sales made to an affiliate of the medical cannabis cultivation
5 facility or adult-use cannabis cultivation facility; or (2) the sales price of the
6 cannabis, if the sale is made to a cannabis establishment that is not an affiliate of
7 the medical cannabis cultivation facility or adult-use cannabis cultivation facility.
8 Existing law requires the revenues collected from those excise taxes to be
9 distributed: (1) to the Cannabis Compliance Board and to local governments in an
10 amount determined to be necessary by the Board to pay the costs of the Board and
11 local governments in carrying out the provisions of existing law governing the
12 medical and adult use of cannabis; and (2) if any money remains, to the State
13 Treasurer to be deposited to the credit of the State Education Fund. (NRS
14 372A.290) Section 5 of this bill eliminates those excise taxes on wholesale sales of
15 cannabis.
16 Existing law imposes an excise tax on each retail sale of cannabis or cannabis
17 products by an adult-use cannabis retail store or cannabis consumption lounge at
18 the rate of 10 percent of the sales price of the cannabis or cannabis products. Under
19 existing law, the revenues collected from that excise tax are required to be paid
20 over as collected to the State Treasurer to be deposited to the credit of the State

21 Education Fund. (NRS 372A.290) Section 5 increases the amount of the excise tax
22 on retail sales of cannabis and cannabis products from 10 percent to 14.25 percent
23 of the sales price of the cannabis or cannabis products. Section 5 additionally
24 requires the revenues from that excise tax to be distributed: (1) to the Cannabis
25 Compliance Board in an amount determined to be necessary by the Board to pay
26 the costs of the Board in carrying out the provisions of existing law governing the
27 medical and adult use of cannabis; and (2) if any money remains, to the State
28 Treasurer to be deposited to the credit of the State Education Fund.
29 Sections 1-4 of this bill revise provisions relating to the excise tax on cannabis
30 to reflect the elimination of the excise taxes on wholesale sales of cannabis in
31 section 5. Section 6 of this bill revises provisions setting forth the sources of
32 revenue for the State Education Fund to eliminate references to the excise taxes on
33 wholesale sales of cannabis. Section 7 of this bill repeals provisions requiring the
34 Department of Taxation to establish procedures to determine the fair market value
35 at wholesale of cannabis, which are rendered obsolete by section 5.

____________
Referred to Committee on Revenue
SUMMARY—Revises provisions governing the taxation of sales of
cannabis and cannabis products. (BDR 32-149)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to taxation; eliminating the excise taxes on
wholesale sales of cannabis; increasing the amount of the
excise tax on retail sales of cannabis and cannabis
products; revising the manner in which the revenues from
the excise tax on retail sales of cannabis and cannabis
products must be distributed; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law imposes an excise tax upon the first wholesale sale of cannabis by
2 a medical cannabis cultivation facility or an adult-use cannabis cultivation facility
3 to another cannabis establishment at the rate of 15 percent of: (1) the fair market
4 value at wholesale for sales made to an affiliate of the medical cannabis cultivation
5 facility or adult-use cannabis cultivation facility; or (2) the sales price of the
6 cannabis, if the sale is made to a cannabis establishment that is not an affiliate of
7 the medical cannabis cultivation facility or adult-use cannabis cultivation facility.
8 Existing law requires the revenues collected from those excise taxes to be
9 distributed: (1) to the Cannabis Compliance Board and to local governments in an
10 amount determined to be necessary by the Board to pay the costs of the Board and
11 local governments in carrying out the provisions of existing law governing the
12 medical and adult use of cannabis; and (2) if any money remains, to the State
13 Treasurer to be deposited to the credit of the State Education Fund. (NRS
14 372A.290) Section 5 of this bill eliminates those excise taxes on wholesale sales of
15 cannabis.
16 Existing law imposes an excise tax on each retail sale of cannabis or cannabis
17 products by an adult-use cannabis retail store or cannabis consumption lounge at
18 the rate of 10 percent of the sales price of the cannabis or cannabis products. Under
19 existing law, the revenues collected from that excise tax are required to be paid
20 over as collected to the State Treasurer to be deposited to the credit of the State
-

21 Education Fund. (NRS 372A.290) Section 5 increases the amount of the excise tax
22 on retail sales of cannabis and cannabis products from 10 percent to 14.25 percent
23 of the sales price of the cannabis or cannabis products. Section 5 additionally
24 requires the revenues from that excise tax to be distributed: (1) to the Cannabis
25 Compliance Board in an amount determined to be necessary by the Board to pay
26 the costs of the Board in carrying out the provisions of existing law governing the
27 medical and adult use of cannabis; and (2) if any money remains, to the State
28 Treasurer to be deposited to the credit of the State Education Fund.
29 Sections 1-4 of this bill revise provisions relating to the excise tax on cannabis
30 to reflect the elimination of the excise taxes on wholesale sales of cannabis in
31 section 5. Section 6 of this bill revises provisions setting forth the sources of
32 revenue for the State Education Fund to eliminate references to the excise taxes on
33 wholesale sales of cannabis. Section 7 of this bill repeals provisions requiring the
