Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 [Existing law sets forth the duties of the State Treasurer, including establishing, by
2 regulation, a program to provide reimbursement for tuition charges, registration fees,
3 laboratory fees and other mandatory fees paid to an institution within the Nevada System of
4 Higher Education by a person who: (1) completed a Teacher Academy College Pathway
5 Program; and (2) has, with certain exceptions, worked as a full-time, licensed teacher at a
6 public school in this State for at least 3 consecutive school years. (NRS 226.420)
7 Section 2 of this bill requires the State Treasurer to also establish by regulation a program
8 to provide: (1) reimbursement for tuition charges, registration fees, laboratory fees,
9 examination fees, licensure fees or certification fees and any other fees paid to an institution
Assembly Amendment No. 263 to Assembly Bill No. 314 Page 4
10 within the Nevada System of Higher Education or to a professional or occupational licensing
11 board or regulatory body of this State by a person who is in financial need and preparing for
12 employment in professions in K-12 education or health care; and (2) grants to certain hospitals
13 to create, expand or fund programs where the hospital coordinates with a secondary school to
14 provide work-based learning opportunities for students. Section 3 of this bill creates the
15 Nevada Education and Health Care Pathways Account and requires money in the Account to
16 be used to carry out the program established pursuant to section 2. Section 4 of this bill makes
17 an appropriation of $10,000,000 to the Account.]
18 Existing law creates the Governor’s Office of Workforce Innovation within the
19 Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation and prescribes the duties of
20 the Office and its Executive Director, which include, without limitation, defining career
21 pathways and identifying priority career pathways for secondary and postsecondary
22 education. (NRS 232.965, 232.975) Under existing law, the Governor's Office of
23 Workforce Innovation is required to establish and administer a Career Pathways
24 Demonstration Program. Pursuant to the Program, the Office is required to identify not
25 more than three priority industries, including K-12 education, for the development and
26 implementation of career pathways and to take certain steps to implement the Program,
27 including, without limitation, establishing measurable objectives for the outcomes of the
28 Program and implementing a competitive process to select proposals for career pathway
29 projects. (NRS 232.985) Section 3.5 of this bill requires one of the priority industries for
30 the purposes of the Program to be health care.
31 Existing law: (1) requires each large school district in this State, meaning any school
32 district which has more than 100,000 pupils enrolled in its public schools (currently only
33 the Clark County School District), to offer a Teacher Academy College Pathway
34 Program at every high school in the school district with 250 or more pupils enrolled to
35 enable pupils in grades 9 to 12 to prepare for employment in professions in K-12
36 education; (2) authorizes a large school district to offer the Program at high schools with
37 fewer than 250 pupils; and (3) authorizes a school district which is not a large school
38 district to offer the Program at high schools in the school district. (NRS 388.223) Section
39 3.7 of this bill enacts similar provisions to establish a Health Care Workforce Pathway
40 Program.
41 Existing law requires the State Treasurer to establish a program to provide
42 reimbursement for tuition charges, registration fees, laboratory fees and any other
43 mandatory fees paid to an institution within the Nevada System of Higher Education by
44 a person who completed the Teacher Academy College Pathway Program and who
45 worked as a full-time, licensed teacher for at least 3 consecutive school years at a public
46 school in this State. Under existing law, the State Treasurer is authorized to provide
47 partial reimbursement for such tuition charges and fees to a person who completed the
48 Teacher Academy College Pathway Program and who has worked as a full-time,
49 licensed teacher for 1 year or 2 consecutive years. (NRS 226.420) Section 3.1 of this bill
50 authorizes the State Treasurer to provide similar reimbursements to persons who
51 complete the Health Care Workforce Pathway Program and who work in this State in
52 the field of health care for a certain period. Section 3.3 of this bill renames the Nevada
53 Grown Educator Account as the Nevada Grown Educator and Health Care Workforce
54 Account to reflect that the Account will be used to carry out the Teacher Academy
55 College Pathway Program and the Health Care Workforce Pathway Program
56 established pursuant to section 3.7.
57 Existing law authorizes the Board of Regents of the University of Nevada to: (1)
58 enter into an agreement with a school district to assist in the implementation of the
59 Teacher Academy College Pathway Program; and (2) establish a program to identify
60 pupils who have completed the Teacher Academy College Pathway Program, or who are
61 expected to complete the Program by the end of grade 12, and who wish to apply for
62 admission to an institution within the Nevada System of Higher Education, and inform
63 such pupils of the institutions within the System where such pupils may qualify for
64 admission. (NRS 396.1219) Section 3.9 of this bill extends similar authority to the Board
65 of Regents to enter into an agreement with a school district to assist in the
66 implementation of the Health Care Workforce Pathway Program established pursuant
67 to section 3.7.

17 impracticable.
18 5. A large school district, and a school district that is not a large school
19 district which elects to offer the Program, may enter into an agreement with the

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to economic development; requiring the State Treasurer to
[establish by regulation a] include in an existing tuition
reimbursement program a program to provide reimbursement for
certain fees related to the education [and licensure] of persons who are
preparing for certain careers [and to award grants to certain hospitals to
provide work-based learning opportunities; creating the Nevada
Education and Health Care Pathways Account; making an
appropriation;] in health care; revising certain provisions governing
that tuition reimbursement program; requiring the Governor’s
Office of Workforce Innovation within the Department of
Employment, Training and Rehabilitation to include health care in
the Career Pathways Demonstration Program; requiring large
school districts and authorizing other school districts to offer a
Health Care Workforce Pathway Program; authorizing the Board
of Regents of the University of Nevada to enter into certain
agreements related to the Health Care Workforce Pathway
Program; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 [Existing law sets forth the duties of the State Treasurer, including establishing, by
2 regulation, a program to provide reimbursement for tuition charges, registration fees,
3 laboratory fees and other mandatory fees paid to an institution within the Nevada System of
4 Higher Education by a person who: (1) completed a Teacher Academy College Pathway
5 Program; and (2) has, with certain exceptions, worked as a full-time, licensed teacher at a
6 public school in this State for at least 3 consecutive school years. (NRS 226.420)
7 Section 2 of this bill requires the State Treasurer to also establish by regulation a program
8 to provide: (1) reimbursement for tuition charges, registration fees, laboratory fees,
9 examination fees, licensure fees or certification fees and any other fees paid to an institution

Assembly Amendment No. 263 to Assembly Bill No. 314 Page 4
10 within the Nevada System of Higher Education or to a professional or occupational licensing
11 board or regulatory body of this State by a person who is in financial need and preparing for
12 employment in professions in K-12 education or health care; and (2) grants to certain hospitals
13 to create, expand or fund programs where the hospital coordinates with a secondary school to
14 provide work-based learning opportunities for students. Section 3 of this bill creates the
15 Nevada Education and Health Care Pathways Account and requires money in the Account to
16 be used to carry out the program established pursuant to section 2. Section 4 of this bill makes
17 an appropriation of $10,000,000 to the Account.]
18 Existing law creates the Governor’s Office of Workforce Innovation within the
19 Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation and prescribes the duties of
20 the Office and its Executive Director, which include, without limitation, defining career
21 pathways and identifying priority career pathways for secondary and postsecondary
22 education. (NRS 232.965, 232.975) Under existing law, the Governor's Office of
23 Workforce Innovation is required to establish and administer a Career Pathways
24 Demonstration Program. Pursuant to the Program, the Office is required to identify not
25 more than three priority industries, including K-12 education, for the development and
26 implementation of career pathways and to take certain steps to implement the Program,
27 including, without limitation, establishing measurable objectives for the outcomes of the
28 Program and implementing a competitive process to select proposals for career pathway
29 projects. (NRS 232.985) Section 3.5 of this bill requires one of the priority industries for
30 the purposes of the Program to be health care.
31 Existing law: (1) requires each large school district in this State, meaning any school
32 district which has more than 100,000 pupils enrolled in its public schools (currently only
33 the Clark County School District), to offer a Teacher Academy College Pathway
34 Program at every high school in the school district with 250 or more pupils enrolled to
35 enable pupils in grades 9 to 12 to prepare for employment in professions in K-12
36 education; (2) authorizes a large school district to offer the Program at high schools with
37 fewer than 250 pupils; and (3) authorizes a school district which is not a large school
38 district to offer the Program at high schools in the school district. (NRS 388.223) Section
39 3.7 of this bill enacts similar provisions to establish a Health Care Workforce Pathway
40 Program.
41 Existing law requires the State Treasurer to establish a program to provide
42 reimbursement for tuition charges, registration fees, laboratory fees and any other
43 mandatory fees paid to an institution within the Nevada System of Higher Education by
44 a person who completed the Teacher Academy College Pathway Program and who
45 worked as a full-time, licensed teacher for at least 3 consecutive school years at a public
46 school in this State. Under existing law, the State Treasurer is authorized to provide
47 partial reimbursement for such tuition charges and fees to a person who completed the
48 Teacher Academy College Pathway Program and who has worked as a full-time,
49 licensed teacher for 1 year or 2 consecutive years. (NRS 226.420) Section 3.1 of this bill
50 authorizes the State Treasurer to provide similar reimbursements to persons who
51 complete the Health Care Workforce Pathway Program and who work in this State in
52 the field of health care for a certain period. Section 3.3 of this bill renames the Nevada
53 Grown Educator Account as the Nevada Grown Educator and Health Care Workforce
54 Account to reflect that the Account will be used to carry out the Teacher Academy
55 College Pathway Program and the Health Care Workforce Pathway Program
56 established pursuant to section 3.7.
57 Existing law authorizes the Board of Regents of the University of Nevada to: (1)
58 enter into an agreement with a school district to assist in the implementation of the
59 Teacher Academy College Pathway Program; and (2) establish a program to identify
60 pupils who have completed the Teacher Academy College Pathway Program, or who are
61 expected to complete the Program by the end of grade 12, and who wish to apply for
62 admission to an institution within the Nevada System of Higher Education, and inform
63 such pupils of the institutions within the System where such pupils may qualify for
64 admission. (NRS 396.1219) Section 3.9 of this bill extends similar authority to the Board
65 of Regents to enter into an agreement with a school district to assist in the
66 implementation of the Health Care Workforce Pathway Program established pursuant
67 to section 3.7.

18 the school district with 250 or more pupils enrolled that will enable interested
19 pupils in grades 9 to 12, inclusive, to prepare for employment in professions in
20 the field of health care. A large school district may offer a Program at high
21 schools with fewer than 250 pupils. A school district that is not a large school
22 district may offer a Program at one or more high schools in the school district.
23 2. A large school district is not required to offer a Program at a specialty
24 school.
25 3. A large school district, and a school district that is not a large school
26 district which elects to offer the Program, shall:
27 (a) Advertise the Program and the benefits of participation in the Program.
28 (b) Ensure that at least one licensed teacher is assigned full-time to
29 implement and teach the Program at each high school in the school district
30 which offers the Program and at which more than two class periods of the
31 Program are offered, except that such a teacher may also serve as the person
32 designated to coordinate career pathway programs at the high school.
33 (c) Assess each pupil entering grade 9 who is or will be enrolled in a high
34 school which offers such a Program and who is interested in participating in the
35 Program, identify any barriers, including, without limitation, academic,
36 financial, socioeconomic and transportation barriers, to the participation in and
37 completion of the Program by such interested pupils and, if such barriers are
38 identified, inform the pupil and the parents or legal guardian of the pupil of any
39 programs and services which are available to help the pupil to overcome such
40 barriers and provide such programs and services to the pupil.
41 (d) Enter into an agreement with the Board of Regents of the University of
42 Nevada to:
43 (1) Enable pupils who participate in the Program to earn up to 12 units
44 of college credit for courses taken and internships engaged in as part of the

46 and internships at no cost or reduced cost to the pupil.
47 (2) Establish qualifications for teachers of the school district who teach
48 courses in the Program which are eligible for college credit, which may include,
49 without limitation, a minimum of 4 years of classroom teaching experience or a
50 master’s degree.
51 (3) Guarantee the admission of otherwise academically qualified pupils
52 who complete the Program to institutions in the Nevada System of Higher

6 that align with the goals of the Program at each high school in the school district
7 which offers the Program.
8 (f) Inform pupils who participate in the Program and the parents and legal
9 guardians of such pupils about programs, services, scholarships and financial aid
10 which are available to assist pupils in applying for admission to institutions in the
11 Nevada System of Higher Education and completing the Program at such an
12 institution.
13 4. A school district may apply to the State Board for an exemption from the
14 provisions of paragraph (d) of subsection 2 with respect to a high school which is
15 not located in an incorporated city if the school district can demonstrate that the
16 location of the high school makes compliance with those provisions
17 impracticable.
18 5. A large school district, and a school district that is not a large school
19 district which elects to offer the Program, may enter into an agreement with the
20 Board of Regents of the University of Nevada to provide a faculty mentor from
21 the Nevada System of Higher Education to teachers of the school district who
22 teach courses in the Program to ensure such courses align with the contents and
23 rigor of equivalent courses taught at institutions within the Nevada System of
24 Higher Education. If the provisions of this subsection conflict with the provisions
25 of chapter 388G of NRS, the provisions of this subsection prevail.
26 6. To complete the Program a pupil must:
27 (a) Successfully complete at least 2 academic years in a program of career
28 and technical education established pursuant to NRS 388.380 in the area of
29 health care; and

31 which is relevant to the field of health care and may include, without limitation,
32 an internship offered pursuant to paragraph (e) of subsection 3 or a work-based
33 learning opportunity provided pursuant to NRS 232.990.
34 7. The State Board:
35 (a) Shall adopt regulations that prescribe the curriculum for the Program
36 which are consistent with the provisions of this section. To the extent a school
37 district provides programs of career and technical education other than the
38 Program, such programs of career and technical education must nonetheless be
39 consistent with the regulations adopted pursuant to this paragraph, to the extent
40 applicable.
41 (b) May adopt such other regulations as are necessary to carry out the
42 provisions of this section.
43 8. A pupil who is enrolled in a high school within a school district, or a
44 parent or legal guardian of such a pupil, who is aggrieved by a final decision
45 regarding the implementation of the Program made by an administrator of the
46 high school or the board of trustees may, within 30 days after the decision is
47 rendered, make a written request to the board of trustees for a hearing for
48 reconsideration of the decision. The board shall schedule the hearing within 30
49 days after receiving the request. The decision of the board of trustees after its
50 reconsideration hearing is a final decision subject to judicial review as provided
51 by law.
