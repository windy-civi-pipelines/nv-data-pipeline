AN ACT relating to economic development; requiring the State
Treasurer to include in an existing tuition reimbursement
program a program to provide reimbursement for certain
fees related to the education of persons who are preparing
for certain careers in health care; revising certain
provisions governing that tuition reimbursement program;

Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates the Governor’s Office of Workforce Innovation within the
2 Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation and prescribes the duties
3 of the Office and its Executive Director, which include, without limitation, defining
4 career pathways and identifying priority career pathways for secondary and
5 postsecondary education. (NRS 232.965, 232.975) Under existing law, the
6 Governor’s Office of Workforce Innovation is required to establish and administer
7 a Career Pathways Demonstration Program. Pursuant to the Program, the Office is
-
*AB314_R1*
– 2 –
8 required to identify not more than three priority industries, including K-12
9 education, for the development and implementation of career pathways and to take
10 certain steps to implement the Program, including, without limitation, establishing
11 measurable objectives for the outcomes of the Program and implementing a
12 competitive process to select proposals for career pathway projects. (NRS 232.985)
13 Section 3.5 of this bill requires one of the priority industries for the purposes of the
14 Program to be health care.
15 Existing law: (1) requires each large school district in this State, meaning any
16 school district which has more than 100,000 pupils enrolled in its public schools
17 (currently only the Clark County School District), to offer a Teacher Academy
18 College Pathway Program at every high school in the school district with 250 or
19 more pupils enrolled to enable pupils in grades 9 to 12 to prepare for employment
20 in professions in K-12 education; (2) authorizes a large school district to offer the
21 Program at high schools with fewer than 250 pupils; and (3) authorizes a school
22 district which is not a large school district to offer the Program at high schools in
23 the school district. (NRS 388.223) Section 3.7 of this bill enacts similar provisions
24 to establish a Health Care Workforce Pathway Program.
25 Existing law requires the State Treasurer to establish a program to provide
26 reimbursement for tuition charges, registration fees, laboratory fees and any other
27 mandatory fees paid to an institution within the Nevada System of Higher
28 Education by a person who completed the Teacher Academy College Pathway
29 Program and who worked as a full-time, licensed teacher for at least 3 consecutive
30 school years at a public school in this State. Under existing law, the State Treasurer
31 is authorized to provide partial reimbursement for such tuition charges and fees to a
32 person who completed the Teacher Academy College Pathway Program and who
33 has worked as a full-time, licensed teacher for 1 year or 2 consecutive years. (NRS
34 226.420) Section 3.1 of this bill authorizes the State Treasurer to provide similar
35 reimbursements to persons who complete the Health Care Workforce Pathway
36 Program and who work in this State in the field of health care for a certain period.
37 Section 3.3 of this bill renames the Nevada Grown Educator Account as the
38 Nevada Grown Educator and Health Care Workforce Account to reflect that the
39 Account will be used to carry out the Teacher Academy College Pathway Program
40 and the Health Care Workforce Pathway Program established pursuant to
41 section 3.7.
42 Existing law authorizes the Board of Regents of the University of Nevada to:
43 (1) enter into an agreement with a school district to assist in the implementation of
44 the Teacher Academy College Pathway Program; and (2) establish a program to
45 identify pupils who have completed the Teacher Academy College Pathway
46 Program, or who are expected to complete the Program by the end of grade 12, and
47 who wish to apply for admission to an institution within the Nevada System of
48 Higher Education, and inform such pupils of the institutions within the System
49 where such pupils may qualify for admission. (NRS 396.1219) Section 3.9 of this
50 bill extends similar authority to the Board of Regents to enter into an agreement
51 with a school district to assist in the implementation of the Health Care Workforce
52 Pathway Program established pursuant to section 3.7.

SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to economic
development. (BDR 18-670)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Contains Appropriation not included
in Executive Budget.
CONTAINS UNFUNDED MANDATE (§ 3.7)
(NOT REQUESTED BY AFFECTED LOCAL GOVERNMENT)
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to economic development; requiring the State
Treasurer to include in an existing tuition reimbursement
program a program to provide reimbursement for certain
fees related to the education of persons who are preparing
for certain careers in health care; revising certain
provisions governing that tuition reimbursement program;
requiring the Governor’s Office of Workforce Innovation
within the Department of Employment, Training and
Rehabilitation to include health care in the Career
Pathways Demonstration Program; requiring large school
districts and authorizing other school districts to offer a
Health Care Workforce Pathway Program; authorizing the
Board of Regents of the University of Nevada to enter
into certain agreements related to the Health Care
Workforce Pathway Program; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates the Governor’s Office of Workforce Innovation within the
2 Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation and prescribes the duties
3 of the Office and its Executive Director, which include, without limitation, defining
4 career pathways and identifying priority career pathways for secondary and
5 postsecondary education. (NRS 232.965, 232.975) Under existing law, the
6 Governor’s Office of Workforce Innovation is required to establish and administer
7 a Career Pathways Demonstration Program. Pursuant to the Program, the Office is
-
*AB314_R1*

– 2 –
8 required to identify not more than three priority industries, including K-12
9 education, for the development and implementation of career pathways and to take
10 certain steps to implement the Program, including, without limitation, establishing
11 measurable objectives for the outcomes of the Program and implementing a
12 competitive process to select proposals for career pathway projects. (NRS 232.985)
13 Section 3.5 of this bill requires one of the priority industries for the purposes of the
14 Program to be health care.
15 Existing law: (1) requires each large school district in this State, meaning any
16 school district which has more than 100,000 pupils enrolled in its public schools
17 (currently only the Clark County School District), to offer a Teacher Academy
18 College Pathway Program at every high school in the school district with 250 or
19 more pupils enrolled to enable pupils in grades 9 to 12 to prepare for employment
20 in professions in K-12 education; (2) authorizes a large school district to offer the
21 Program at high schools with fewer than 250 pupils; and (3) authorizes a school
22 district which is not a large school district to offer the Program at high schools in
23 the school district. (NRS 388.223) Section 3.7 of this bill enacts similar provisions
24 to establish a Health Care Workforce Pathway Program.
25 Existing law requires the State Treasurer to establish a program to provide
26 reimbursement for tuition charges, registration fees, laboratory fees and any other
27 mandatory fees paid to an institution within the Nevada System of Higher
28 Education by a person who completed the Teacher Academy College Pathway
29 Program and who worked as a full-time, licensed teacher for at least 3 consecutive
30 school years at a public school in this State. Under existing law, the State Treasurer
31 is authorized to provide partial reimbursement for such tuition charges and fees to a
32 person who completed the Teacher Academy College Pathway Program and who
33 has worked as a full-time, licensed teacher for 1 year or 2 consecutive years. (NRS
34 226.420) Section 3.1 of this bill authorizes the State Treasurer to provide similar
35 reimbursements to persons who complete the Health Care Workforce Pathway
36 Program and who work in this State in the field of health care for a certain period.
37 Section 3.3 of this bill renames the Nevada Grown Educator Account as the
38 Nevada Grown Educator and Health Care Workforce Account to reflect that the
39 Account will be used to carry out the Teacher Academy College Pathway Program
40 and the Health Care Workforce Pathway Program established pursuant to
41 section 3.7.
42 Existing law authorizes the Board of Regents of the University of Nevada to:
43 (1) enter into an agreement with a school district to assist in the implementation of
44 the Teacher Academy College Pathway Program; and (2) establish a program to
45 identify pupils who have completed the Teacher Academy College Pathway
46 Program, or who are expected to complete the Program by the end of grade 12, and
47 who wish to apply for admission to an institution within the Nevada System of
48 Higher Education, and inform such pupils of the institutions within the System
49 where such pupils may qualify for admission. (NRS 396.1219) Section 3.9 of this
50 bill extends similar authority to the Board of Regents to enter into an agreement
51 with a school district to assist in the implementation of the Health Care Workforce
52 Pathway Program established pursuant to section 3.7.

9 Program at every high school in the school district with 250 or
10 more pupils enrolled that will enable interested pupils in grades 9
11 to 12, inclusive, to prepare for employment in professions in the
12 field of health care. A large school district may offer a Program at
13 high schools with fewer than 250 pupils. A school district that is

15 high schools in the school district.
16 2. A large school district is not required to offer a Program at
17 a specialty school.
18 3. A large school district, and a school district that is not a
19 large school district which elects to offer the Program, shall:
20 (a) Advertise the Program and the benefits of participation in
21 the Program.
22 (b) Ensure that at least one licensed teacher is assigned full-
23 time to implement and teach the Program at each high school in
24 the school district which offers the Program and at which more
25 than two class periods of the Program are offered, except that
26 such a teacher may also serve as the person designated to
27 coordinate career pathway programs at the high school.
28 (c) Assess each pupil entering grade 9 who is or will be
29 enrolled in a high school which offers such a Program and who is
30 interested in participating in the Program, identify any barriers,
31 including, without limitation, academic, financial, socioeconomic
32 and transportation barriers, to the participation in and completion
33 of the Program by such interested pupils and, if such barriers are
34 identified, inform the pupil and the parents or legal guardian of
35 the pupil of any programs and services which are available to help
36 the pupil to overcome such barriers and provide such programs
37 and services to the pupil.
38 (d) Enter into an agreement with the Board of Regents of the
39 University of Nevada to:
40 (1) Enable pupils who participate in the Program to earn
41 up to 12 units of college credit for courses taken and internships

20 at such an institution.
21 4. A school district may apply to the State Board for an
22 exemption from the provisions of paragraph (d) of subsection 2
23 with respect to a high school which is not located in an
24 incorporated city if the school district can demonstrate that the
25 location of the high school makes compliance with those
26 provisions impracticable.
27 5. A large school district, and a school district that is not a
28 large school district which elects to offer the Program, may enter
29 into an agreement with the Board of Regents of the University of

12 district, or a parent or legal guardian of such a pupil, who is
13 aggrieved by a final decision regarding the implementation of the
14 Program made by an administrator of the high school or the board
15 of trustees may, within 30 days after the decision is rendered,
16 make a written request to the board of trustees for a hearing for
17 reconsideration of the decision. The board shall schedule the
