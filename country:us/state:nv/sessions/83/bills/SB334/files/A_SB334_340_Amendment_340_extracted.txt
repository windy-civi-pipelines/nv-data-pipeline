EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to correctional institutions; [revising provisions relating to the
wages paid to offenders;] requiring the [Legislative Auditor to conduct
an audit concerning the wages paid] Director of the Department of
Corrections to submit an annual report to the Director of the
Legislative Counsel Bureau relating to the employment of
offenders; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 [Existing law requires an employer to pay an employee a wage of not less than a certain
2 minimum wage. (Nev. Const. Art. 15, § 16; NRS 608.250) However, existing law does not
3 require offenders to be paid the federal or state minimum wage for their employment in a
4 program for the employment of offenders. (NRS 209.461) Section 1 of this bill requires
5 offenders to be paid a progressively increasing percentage of the state minimum wage over a
6 5-year period, such that, beginning on July 1, 2029, offenders are paid at least the state
7 minimum wage.
8 Existing law requires the State Forester Firewarden to: (1) establish and carry out a
9 program for operating conservation camps in this State, which may use offenders to perform
10 certain tasks; and (2) determine the amount of wages that must be paid to offenders who
11 participate in such camps. (NRS 209.231, 209.457, 472.040) Section 2 of this bill provides
12 that these wages must be equivalent to or exceed the wages set forth in section 1.
13 Section 3 of this bill requires the Legislative Auditor to conduct an audit of the wages
14 paid to offenders each fiscal year during the period beginning on July 1, 2025, and ending on
15 June 30, 2029, to determine compliance with section 1.] This bill requires the Director of
16 the Department of Corrections to submit a report relating to the employment of
17 offenders on or before March 1 of each year to the Director of the Legislative Counsel
18 Bureau for transmittal to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and the Assembly
19 Standing Committee on Ways and Means during a regular or special session of the
20 Legislature, or the Interim Finance Committee when the Legislature is not in session.
21 The report must include, without limitation, the following information relating to the
22 previous year: (1) the number of offenders who were eligible for employment; (2) the
23 number of offenders who were employed; (3) the number of offenders who refused
24 employment; (4) the pay of the offenders who were employed; (5) the amount of the
25 deductions from the accounts of offenders who were employed; and (6) of the offenders
26 who were employed and who were subsequently released, the percentage of offenders
Senate Amendment No. 340 to Senate Bill No. 334 Page 4
27 who found employment following release with the industries in which they were
28 employed.
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN

5 (b) Except as otherwise provided in this section, to the extent practicable,
6 require each offender, except those whose behavior is found by the Director to

8 employment, unless excused for a medical reason or to attend educational classes in
9 accordance with NRS 209.396. The Director shall require as a condition of
10 employment that an offender sign an authorization for the deductions from his or
11 her wages made pursuant to NRS 209.463. Authorization to make the deductions
12 pursuant to NRS 209.463 is implied from the employment of an offender and a
13 signed authorization from the offender is not required for the Director to make the
14 deductions pursuant to NRS 209.463.
15 (c) Use the earnings from services and manufacturing conducted by the
16 institutions and the money paid by private employers who employ the offenders to
17 offset the costs of operating the prison system and to provide wages for the
18 offenders being trained or employed.
19 (d) Provide equipment, space and management for services and manufacturing
20 by offenders.
21 (e) Employ craftsmen and other personnel to supervise and instruct offenders.

27 (h) On or before January 1, 2014, and every 5 years thereafter, submit a report
28 to the Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau for distribution to the Joint
29 Interim Standing Committee on the Judiciary. The report must include, without
30 limitation, an analysis of existing contracts with private employers for the
31 employment of offenders and the potential impact of those contracts on private
32 industry in this State.
33 (i) Submit a report to each meeting of the Interim Finance Committee
34 identifying any accounts receivable related to a program for the employment of

14 (b) Acquire, review, use or have control over or access to personal information
15 concerning any person who is not incarcerated.
16 4. Each fiscal year, the cumulative profits and losses, if any, of the programs
17 for the employment of offenders established by the Director must result in a profit
18 for the Department. The following must not be included in determining whether
19 there is a profit for the Department:
20 (a) Fees credited to the Fund for Prison Industries pursuant to NRS 482.268,
21 any revenue collected by the Department for the leasing of space, facilities or
22 equipment within the institutions or facilities of the Department, and any interest or
23 income earned on the money in the Fund for Prison Industries.
24 (b) The selling expenses of the Central Administrative Office of the programs

32 Administrative Office and related payroll taxes and costs, the costs of telephone
33 usage, and the costs of office supplies used and postage used.
34 5. If any state-sponsored program incurs a net loss for 2 consecutive fiscal
35 years, the Director shall appear before the Joint Interim Standing Committee on the
36 Judiciary to explain the reasons for the net loss and provide a plan for the
37 generation of a profit in the next fiscal year. If the program does not generate a
38 profit in the third fiscal year, the Director shall take appropriate steps to resolve the
39 issue.
40 6. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3, the Director may, with the

43 private employers to be used for the vocational training and employment of
44 offenders.
45 (b) Grant to reliable offenders the privilege of leaving institutions or facilities
46 of the Department at certain times for the purpose of vocational training or
47 employment.

EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to correctional institutions; [revising provisions relating to the
wages paid to offenders;] requiring the [Legislative Auditor to conduct
an audit concerning the wages paid] Director of the Department of
Corrections to submit an annual report to the Director of the
Legislative Counsel Bureau relating to the employment of
offenders; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 [Existing law requires an employer to pay an employee a wage of not less than a certain
2 minimum wage. (Nev. Const. Art. 15, § 16; NRS 608.250) However, existing law does not
3 require offenders to be paid the federal or state minimum wage for their employment in a
4 program for the employment of offenders. (NRS 209.461) Section 1 of this bill requires
5 offenders to be paid a progressively increasing percentage of the state minimum wage over a
6 5-year period, such that, beginning on July 1, 2029, offenders are paid at least the state
7 minimum wage.
8 Existing law requires the State Forester Firewarden to: (1) establish and carry out a
9 program for operating conservation camps in this State, which may use offenders to perform
10 certain tasks; and (2) determine the amount of wages that must be paid to offenders who
11 participate in such camps. (NRS 209.231, 209.457, 472.040) Section 2 of this bill provides
12 that these wages must be equivalent to or exceed the wages set forth in section 1.
13 Section 3 of this bill requires the Legislative Auditor to conduct an audit of the wages
14 paid to offenders each fiscal year during the period beginning on July 1, 2025, and ending on
15 June 30, 2029, to determine compliance with section 1.] This bill requires the Director of
16 the Department of Corrections to submit a report relating to the employment of
17 offenders on or before March 1 of each year to the Director of the Legislative Counsel
18 Bureau for transmittal to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and the Assembly
19 Standing Committee on Ways and Means during a regular or special session of the
20 Legislature, or the Interim Finance Committee when the Legislature is not in session.
21 The report must include, without limitation, the following information relating to the
22 previous year: (1) the number of offenders who were eligible for employment; (2) the
23 number of offenders who were employed; (3) the number of offenders who refused
24 employment; (4) the pay of the offenders who were employed; (5) the amount of the
25 deductions from the accounts of offenders who were employed; and (6) of the offenders
26 who were employed and who were subsequently released, the percentage of offenders

Senate Amendment No. 340 to Senate Bill No. 334 Page 4
27 who found employment following release with the industries in which they were
28 employed.

9 accordance with NRS 209.396. The Director shall require as a condition of
10 employment that an offender sign an authorization for the deductions from his or
11 her wages made pursuant to NRS 209.463. Authorization to make the deductions
12 pursuant to NRS 209.463 is implied from the employment of an offender and a
