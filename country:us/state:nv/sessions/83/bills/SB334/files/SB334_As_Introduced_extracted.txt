EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to correctional institutions; revising provisions
relating to the wages paid to offenders; requiring the
Legislative Auditor to conduct an audit concerning the
wages paid to offenders; and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires an employer to pay an employee a wage of not less than a
2 certain minimum wage. (Nev. Const. Art. 15, § 16; NRS 608.250) However,
3 existing law does not require offenders to be paid the federal or state minimum
4 wage for their employment in a program for the employment of offenders. (NRS
5 209.461) Section 1 of this bill requires offenders to be paid a progressively
6 increasing percentage of the state minimum wage over a 5-year period, such that,
7 beginning on July 1, 2029, offenders are paid at least the state minimum wage.
8 Existing law requires the State Forester Firewarden to: (1) establish and carry
9 out a program for operating conservation camps in this State, which may use
10 offenders to perform certain tasks; and (2) determine the amount of wages that must
11 be paid to offenders who participate in such camps. (NRS 209.231, 209.457,
12 472.040) Section 2 of this bill provides that these wages must be equivalent to or
13 exceed the wages set forth in section 1.
14 Section 3 of this bill requires the Legislative Auditor to conduct an audit of the
15 wages paid to offenders each fiscal year during the period beginning on July 1,
16 2025, and ending on June 30, 2029, to determine compliance with section 1.
