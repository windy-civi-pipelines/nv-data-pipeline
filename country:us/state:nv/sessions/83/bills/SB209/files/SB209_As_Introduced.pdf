EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to pharmacy benefit managers; expanding the
scope of certain provisions; prohibiting pharmacy benefit
managers from engaging in certain practices; requiring
pharmacy benefit managers to make certain disclosures;
requiring pharmacy benefit managers to pass rebates
along to certain insurers and insureds; requiring pharmacy
benefit managers and the Commissioner of Insurance to
prepare certain reports; providing a cause of action for
certain pharmacies; requiring certain insurers to use
passed-along rebate funds for certain purposes; providing
penalties; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires a pharmacy benefit manager to obtain a certificate of
2 registration as an insurance administrator from the Commissioner of Insurance and
3 comply with the requirements that apply to insurance administrators generally.
4 (NRS 683A.025, 683A.08522-683A.0893) Existing law additionally imposes
5 certain requirements specifically regulating the operation of pharmacy benefit
6 managers, which are entities that manage pharmacy benefits plans. (NRS
7 683A.171-683A.179) Existing law defines “pharmacy benefits plan” to refer to
8 insurance coverage of prescription drugs. (NRS 683A.175) Section 19 of this bill
9 expands the scope of that definition to also refer to insurance coverage of
10 pharmacist services. Section 19 thereby expands the scope of provisions governing
11 pharmacy benefit managers to also apply to entities that manage such coverage.

12 Sections 2-13 of this bill define certain other terms relevant to pharmacy benefit
13 managers, and section 18 of this bill establishes the applicability of those
14 definitions. Section 14 of this bill prohibits a pharmacy benefit manager that
15 manages a plan which provides coverage through a network from requiring a
16 person to use a pharmacy affiliated with the pharmacy benefit manager if there are
17 other, nonaffiliated pharmacies in the network. Section 14 additionally prohibits a
18 pharmacy benefit manager from engaging in certain practices which are intended or
19 have the effect of steering a person towards an affiliated pharmacy instead of a
20 nonaffiliated pharmacy in the network. Section 14 also prohibits a pharmacy
21 benefit manager from discriminating against a nonaffiliated pharmacy. Section 15
22 of this bill requires a pharmacy benefit manager to disclose to a third party insurer
23 for which the pharmacy benefit manager manages a pharmacy benefits plan the
24 amount and types of fees that the pharmacy benefit manager charges the third party
25 for managing the plan or otherwise receives from other entities, including rebates,
26 in connection with managing the plan.
27 Existing law authorizes the Department of Health and Human Services to enter
28 into a contract with a pharmacy benefit manager to manage coverage of
29 prescription drugs under the State Plan for Medicaid and the Children’s Health
30 Insurance Program that requires the pharmacy benefit manager to provide to the
31 Department all rebates received for purchasing drugs in relation to those programs.
32 (NRS 422.4053) Section 15 imposes similar requirements for pharmacy benefit
33 managers that manage other pharmacy benefits plans. Specifically, section 15
34 requires a pharmacy benefit manager to provide the entire amount of any rebate the
35 pharmacy benefit manager receives in connection with providing pharmacy benefit
36 management services for a third party insurer that provides pharmacy coverage to:
37 (1) persons covered by the third party; or (2) the third party. Sections 22, 24-29, 32,
38 33, 36 and 37 of this bill require certain third parties that provide coverage for
39 prescription drugs to use any rebate money received from a pharmacy benefit
40 manager pursuant to section 15 for the sole purpose of reducing premiums and
41 eliminating or reducing cost-sharing obligations of covered persons. Section 23 of
42 this bill authorizes the Commissioner to require a domestic insurer that issues a
43 policy of individual health insurance to a person residing in another state to meet
44 the requirements of section 22 in certain circumstances. Sections 30 and 34 of this
45 bill indicate that the requirement governing the use of rebates received from a
46 pharmacy benefit manager is inapplicable to a managed care organization that is
47 providing coverage to recipients of Medicaid. Section 31 of this bill authorizes the
48 Commissioner to suspend or revoke the certificate of a health maintenance
49 organization that fails to comply with the requirements of section 29. The
50 Commissioner would also be authorized to take such action against other health
51 insurers who fail to comply with the requirements of sections 22, 24-28, 32 and 33.
52 (NRS 680A.200)
53 Section 16 of this bill prohibits a pharmacy benefit manager from: (1) using
54 spread pricing, which is a technique by which a pharmacy benefit manager charges
55 a third party an amount for a prescription drug that is different from the amount that
56 the pharmacy benefit manager reimburses a pharmacy for the same drug; (2)
57 agreeing to exclusively cover certain drugs; and (3) making or disseminating a false
58 or misleading statement or advertisement. Section 21 of this bill additionally
59 prohibits a pharmacy benefit manager from engaging in certain practices while
60 doing business with pharmacies. Section 21 also authorizes a pharmacy to bring an
61 action to recover certain damages against a pharmacy benefit manager that
62 retaliates against the pharmacy for reporting or attempting to remedy a potential or
63 actual violation of law applicable to insurance by the pharmacy benefit manager.
64 Section 17 of this bill requires a pharmacy benefit manager to submit to the
65 Commissioner an annual report detailing certain business practices of the pharmacy
66 benefit manager as well as certain information regarding pricing and rebates
-

– 3 –
67 relating to the prescription drugs administered by the pharmacy benefit manager.
68 Sections 17 and 35 of this bill provide for the confidentiality of the information
69 contained in the report. Section 17 requires the Commissioner to compile, submit
70 to the Legislature and publish on the Internet a report once every 2 years on the
71 overall impact of pharmacy benefit managers on the cost of prescription drugs in
72 this State based on the reports submitted by the pharmacy benefit managers.
73 Existing law exempts certain federally regulated insurance coverage of
74 prescription drugs provided by employers for their employees from requirements
75 governing pharmacy benefit managers except where the pharmacy benefit manager
76 is required by contract to comply with those requirements. (NRS 683A.177) In
77 Rutledge v. Pharm. Care Mgmt. Ass’n, the United States Supreme Court held that
78 states are authorized to impose certain general requirements governing pharmacy
79 benefit managers on pharmacy benefit managers that manage such coverage. (592
80 U.S. 80, 89 (2020)) Section 20 of this bill removes the exemption for such
81 coverage from certain requirements governing pharmacy benefit managers, thereby
82 requiring a pharmacy benefit manager that manages such coverage to comply with
83 those requirements. Section 20 also subjects a pharmacy benefit manager that
84 manages such coverage to the requirements of this bill, to the extent authorized by
85 current precedent of the United States Supreme Court.

1 3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a
2 public book or record shall not deny a request made pursuant to
3 subsection 1 to inspect or copy or receive a copy of a public book or

5 information that is confidential if the governmental entity can
6 redact, delete, conceal or separate, including, without limitation,
7 electronically, the confidential information from the information
8 included in the public book or record that is not otherwise
9 confidential.
10 4. If requested, a governmental entity shall provide a copy of a
11 public record in an electronic format by means of an electronic
12 medium. Nothing in this subsection requires a governmental entity
13 to provide a copy of a public record in an electronic format or by
14 means of an electronic medium if:
15 (a) The public record:
16 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
17 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
18 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by
19 means of an electronic medium would:
20 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
21 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential
22 and that cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from
23 information that is not otherwise confidential.
24 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who
25 has legal custody or control of a public record:

30 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon
31 request, prepare the copy of the public record and shall not require

40 or health insurance, or any combination thereof, for the benefit of its
41 officers and employees, and the dependents of officers and

43 necessary, have authorized the governing body to make deductions
44 from their compensation for the payment of premiums on the
45 insurance.
-
*SB209*

– 22 –
1 (b) Purchase group policies of life, accident or health insurance,

6 and, where necessary, deduct from the compensation of officers and
7 employees the premiums upon insurance and pay the deductions
8 upon the premiums.
9 (c) Provide group life, accident or health coverage through a
10 self-insurance reserve fund and, where necessary, deduct
11 contributions to the maintenance of the fund from the compensation
12 of officers and employees and pay the deductions into the fund. The

14 compensation of officers and employees and contributions of the
15 governing body must be maintained as an internal service fund as
16 defined by NRS 354.543. The money must be deposited in a state or
17 national bank or credit union authorized to transact business in the
18 State of Nevada. Any independent administrator of a fund created
19 under this section is subject to the licensing requirements of chapter
20 683A of NRS, and must be a resident of this State. Any contract
21 with an independent administrator must be approved by the
22 Commissioner of Insurance as to the reasonableness of
23 administrative charges in relation to contributions collected and
24 benefits provided. The provisions of NRS 439.581 to 439.597,

40 agency of the State of Nevada.
41 2. If a school district offers group insurance to its officers and
42 employees pursuant to this section, members of the board of trustees
43 of the school district must not be excluded from participating in the
44 group insurance. If the amount of the deductions from compensation
-

– 23 –
1 required to pay for the group insurance exceeds the compensation to
2 which a trustee is entitled, the difference must be paid by the trustee.
3 3. In any county in which a legal services organization exists,
4 the governing body of the county, or of any school district,
5 municipal corporation, political subdivision, public corporation or
