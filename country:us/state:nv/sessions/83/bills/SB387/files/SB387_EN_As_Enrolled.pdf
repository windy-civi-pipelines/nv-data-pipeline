Senate Bill No. 387–Senator Lange
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to health care; requiring certain health insurance
to include coverage for certain screening for lung cancer;
requiring the Department of Health and Human Services to
conduct a study on access to screening for lung cancer; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law requires certain private policies of insurance regulated under
Nevada law to include coverage for screening for colorectal cancer if the policy of
insurance covers the treatment of colorectal cancer. (NRS 689A.04042, 689B.0367,
695B.1907, 695C.1731, 695G.168) Existing law also requires employers to provide
certain benefits for health care to employees, including the coverage required of
health insurers, if the employer provides health benefits for its employee.
(NRS 608.1555)
Sections 1, 3-8 and 11 of this bill require certain private policies of health
insurance and health plans that cover treatment for lung cancer to also cover
screening for lung cancer in accordance with: (1) the guidelines published by the
American Cancer Society; or (2) certain other guidelines or reports concerning
screening for lung cancer which are published by nationally recognized
professional organizations. Sections 9 and 11.5 of this bill provide that those
requirements do not apply to Medicaid managed care organizations. Section 2 of
this bill authorizes the Commissioner of Insurance to require certain policies of
health insurance issued by a domestic insurer to a person who resides in another
state to include the coverage required by section 1. Section 10 of this bill
authorizes the Commissioner to suspend or revoke the certificate of authority issued
to a health maintenance organization that fails to comply with the requirements of
section 8. The Commissioner would also be authorized to take such action against
other health insurers who fail to comply with the requirements of sections 1, 3-8
and 11. (NRS 680A.200)
Section 17 of this bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services
to: (1) conduct a study to determine if the criteria adopted by the American Cancer
Society relating to screening for lung cancer creates inequities in access to
screening for lung cancer based on sex or gender identity or expression; and (2)
submit a report on its conclusions to the Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau
for transmittal to the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Health and Human
Services.
