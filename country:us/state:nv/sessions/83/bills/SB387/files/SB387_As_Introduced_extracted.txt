EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; requiring certain health insurance
to include coverage for certain screening for lung cancer;
requiring the Governor to annually proclaim November to
be “Lung Cancer Awareness Month” and a certain day in
November to be “Lung Cancer Screening Day”; requiring
the Department of Health and Human Services to conduct
a study on access to screening for lung cancer; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires public and private policies of insurance regulated under
2 Nevada law to include certain coverage. (NRS 287.010, 287.04335, 422.27172-
3 422.272428, 689A.04033-689A.0465, 689B.0303-689B.0379, 689C.1652-
4 689C.169, 689C.194, 689C.1945, 689C.195, 689C.425, 695A.184-695A.1875,
5 695A.265, 695B.1901-695B.1948, 695C.050, 695C.1691-695C.176, 695G.162-
6 695G.177) Existing law also requires employers to provide certain benefits for
7 health care to employees, including the coverage required of health insurers, if the
8 employer provides health benefits for its employee. (NRS 608.1555)
9 Sections 1, 3-9, 11 and 14-16 of this bill require certain public and private
10 policies of health insurance and health plans, including Medicaid, to cover, without
11 requiring a deductible, copayment or coinsurance: (1) an annual screening for lung
12 cancer for persons at least 50 years of age but not more than 80 years of age who
13 have a certain history of smoking; and (2) certain follow-up testing. Section 2 of
14 this bill authorizes the Commissioner of Insurance to require certain policies of
15 health insurance issued by a domestic insurer to a person who resides in another
16 state to include the coverage required by section 1. Section 10 of this bill
17 authorizes the Commissioner to suspend or revoke the certificate of authority issued
-
*SB387*
– 2 –
18 to a health maintenance organization that fails to comply with the requirements of
19 section 8. The Commissioner would also be authorized to take such action against
20 other health insurers who fail to comply with the requirements of sections 1, 3-8
21 and 11. (NRS 680A.200) Section 12 of this bill makes a conforming change to
22 require the Director of the Department of Health and Human Services to administer
23 the provisions of section 16 in the same manner as other provisions relating to
24 Medicaid.
25 Existing law sets forth various days, weeks or months of observance in this
26 State. (NRS 236.018-236.095) Section 13 of this bill requires the Governor to
27 annually proclaim the month of November to be “Lung Cancer Awareness Month”
28 and the second Saturday of November to be “Lung Cancer Screening Day” to bring
29 to the attention of the residents of this State factual information on lung cancer.
30 Section 17 of this bill requires the Department to: (1) conduct a study to
31 determine if the criteria adopted by the United States Preventive Services Task
32 Force relating to screening for lung cancer creates inequities in access to screening
33 for lung cancer based on sex or gender identity or expression; and (2) submit a
34 report on its conclusions to the Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau for
35 transmittal to the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Health and Human Services.

S.B. 387
SENATE BILL NO. 387–SENATOR LANGE
MARCH 17, 2025
____________
Referred to Committee on Commerce and Labor
SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to the prevention and
early detection of lung cancer. (BDR 57-68)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
CONTAINS UNFUNDED MANDATE (§ 14)
(NOT REQUESTED BY AFFECTED LOCAL GOVERNMENT)
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; requiring certain health insurance
to include coverage for certain screening for lung cancer;
requiring the Governor to annually proclaim November to
be “Lung Cancer Awareness Month” and a certain day in
November to be “Lung Cancer Screening Day”; requiring
the Department of Health and Human Services to conduct
a study on access to screening for lung cancer; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires public and private policies of insurance regulated under
2 Nevada law to include certain coverage. (NRS 287.010, 287.04335, 422.27172-
3 422.272428, 689A.04033-689A.0465, 689B.0303-689B.0379, 689C.1652-
4 689C.169, 689C.194, 689C.1945, 689C.195, 689C.425, 695A.184-695A.1875,
5 695A.265, 695B.1901-695B.1948, 695C.050, 695C.1691-695C.176, 695G.162-
6 695G.177) Existing law also requires employers to provide certain benefits for
7 health care to employees, including the coverage required of health insurers, if the
8 employer provides health benefits for its employee. (NRS 608.1555)
9 Sections 1, 3-9, 11 and 14-16 of this bill require certain public and private
10 policies of health insurance and health plans, including Medicaid, to cover, without
11 requiring a deductible, copayment or coinsurance: (1) an annual screening for lung
12 cancer for persons at least 50 years of age but not more than 80 years of age who
13 have a certain history of smoking; and (2) certain follow-up testing. Section 2 of
14 this bill authorizes the Commissioner of Insurance to require certain policies of
15 health insurance issued by a domestic insurer to a person who resides in another
16 state to include the coverage required by section 1. Section 10 of this bill
17 authorizes the Commissioner to suspend or revoke the certificate of authority issued
-
*SB387*

– 2 –
18 to a health maintenance organization that fails to comply with the requirements of
19 section 8. The Commissioner would also be authorized to take such action against
20 other health insurers who fail to comply with the requirements of sections 1, 3-8
21 and 11. (NRS 680A.200) Section 12 of this bill makes a conforming change to
22 require the Director of the Department of Health and Human Services to administer
23 the provisions of section 16 in the same manner as other provisions relating to
24 Medicaid.
25 Existing law sets forth various days, weeks or months of observance in this
26 State. (NRS 236.018-236.095) Section 13 of this bill requires the Governor to
27 annually proclaim the month of November to be “Lung Cancer Awareness Month”
28 and the second Saturday of November to be “Lung Cancer Screening Day” to bring
29 to the attention of the residents of this State factual information on lung cancer.
30 Section 17 of this bill requires the Department to: (1) conduct a study to
31 determine if the criteria adopted by the United States Preventive Services Task
32 Force relating to screening for lung cancer creates inequities in access to screening
33 for lung cancer based on sex or gender identity or expression; and (2) submit a
