EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; requiring certain health insurance to include
coverage for certain screening for lung cancer; [requiring the Governor
to annually proclaim November to be “Lung Cancer Awareness
Month” and a certain day in November to be “Lung Cancer Screening
Day”;] requiring the Department of Health and Human Services to
conduct a study on access to screening for lung cancer; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires [public and] certain private policies of insurance regulated under
2 Nevada law to include [certain] coverage [.] for screening for colorectal cancer if the policy
3 of insurance covers the treatment of colorectal cancer. (NRS [287.010, 287.04335,
4 422.27172-422.272428, 689A.04033-689A.0465, 689B.0303-689B.0379, 689C.1652-
5 689C.169, 689C.194, 689C.1945, 689C.195, 689C.425, 695A.184-695A.1875, 695A.265,
6 695B.1901-695B.1948, 695C.050, 695C.1691-695C.176, 695G.162-695G.177)] 689A.04042,
7 689B.0367, 695B.1907, 695C.1731, 695G.168) Existing law also requires employers to
8 provide certain benefits for health care to employees, including the coverage required of
9 health insurers, if the employer provides health benefits for its employee. (NRS 608.1555)
10 Sections 1, [3-9,] 3-8 and 11 [and 14-16] of this bill require certain [public and] private
11 policies of health insurance and health plans [, including Medicaid, to] that cover treatment
12 for lung cancer to also cover [, without requiring a deductible, copayment or coinsurance: (1)
13 an annual] screening for lung cancer [for persons at least 50 years of age but not more than 80
14 years of age who have a certain history of smoking; and] in accordance with: (1) the
15 guidelines published by the American Cancer Society; or (2) [certain follow-up testing.]
16 certain other guidelines or reports concerning screening for lung cancer which are
17 published by nationally recognized professional organizations. Sections 9 and 11.5 of this
18 bill provide that those requirements do not apply to Medicaid managed care
19 organizations. Section 2 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner of Insurance to require
20 certain policies of health insurance issued by a domestic insurer to a person who resides in
21 another state to include the coverage required by section 1. Section 10 of this bill authorizes
22 the Commissioner to suspend or revoke the certificate of authority issued to a health
23 maintenance organization that fails to comply with the requirements of section 8. The
Senate Amendment No. 54 to Senate Bill No. 387 Page 4
24 Commissioner would also be authorized to take such action against other health insurers who
25 fail to comply with the requirements of sections 1, 3-8 and 11. (NRS 680A.200) [Section 12
26 of this bill makes a conforming change to require the Director of the Department of Health
27 and Human Services to administer the provisions of section 16 in the same manner as other
28 provisions relating to Medicaid.
29 Existing law sets forth various days, weeks or months of observance in this State. (NRS
30 236.018-236.095) Section 13 of this bill requires the Governor to annually proclaim the month
31 of November to be “Lung Cancer Awareness Month” and the second Saturday of November
32 to be “Lung Cancer Screening Day” to bring to the attention of the residents of this State
33 factual information on lung cancer.]
34 Section 17 of this bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services to: (1)
35 conduct a study to determine if the criteria adopted by the [United States Preventive Services
36 Task Force] American Cancer Society relating to screening for lung cancer creates inequities
37 in access to screening for lung cancer based on sex or gender identity or expression; and (2)
38 submit a report on its conclusions to the Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau for
39 transmittal to the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Health and Human Services.

SUMMARY—Revises provisions relating to the prevention and early detection of
lung cancer. (BDR 57-68)
FISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.
Effect on the State: Yes.
[CONTAINS UNFUNDED MANDATE (§ 14)
(NOT REQUESTED BY AFFECTED LOCAL GOVERNMENT)]
~
EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to health care; requiring certain health insurance to include
coverage for certain screening for lung cancer; [requiring the Governor
to annually proclaim November to be “Lung Cancer Awareness
Month” and a certain day in November to be “Lung Cancer Screening
Day”;] requiring the Department of Health and Human Services to
conduct a study on access to screening for lung cancer; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires [public and] certain private policies of insurance regulated under
2 Nevada law to include [certain] coverage [.] for screening for colorectal cancer if the policy
3 of insurance covers the treatment of colorectal cancer. (NRS [287.010, 287.04335,
4 422.27172-422.272428, 689A.04033-689A.0465, 689B.0303-689B.0379, 689C.1652-
5 689C.169, 689C.194, 689C.1945, 689C.195, 689C.425, 695A.184-695A.1875, 695A.265,
6 695B.1901-695B.1948, 695C.050, 695C.1691-695C.176, 695G.162-695G.177)] 689A.04042,
7 689B.0367, 695B.1907, 695C.1731, 695G.168) Existing law also requires employers to
8 provide certain benefits for health care to employees, including the coverage required of
9 health insurers, if the employer provides health benefits for its employee. (NRS 608.1555)
10 Sections 1, [3-9,] 3-8 and 11 [and 14-16] of this bill require certain [public and] private
11 policies of health insurance and health plans [, including Medicaid, to] that cover treatment
12 for lung cancer to also cover [, without requiring a deductible, copayment or coinsurance: (1)
13 an annual] screening for lung cancer [for persons at least 50 years of age but not more than 80
14 years of age who have a certain history of smoking; and] in accordance with: (1) the
15 guidelines published by the American Cancer Society; or (2) [certain follow-up testing.]
16 certain other guidelines or reports concerning screening for lung cancer which are
17 published by nationally recognized professional organizations. Sections 9 and 11.5 of this
18 bill provide that those requirements do not apply to Medicaid managed care
19 organizations. Section 2 of this bill authorizes the Commissioner of Insurance to require
20 certain policies of health insurance issued by a domestic insurer to a person who resides in
21 another state to include the coverage required by section 1. Section 10 of this bill authorizes
22 the Commissioner to suspend or revoke the certificate of authority issued to a health
23 maintenance organization that fails to comply with the requirements of section 8. The

Senate Amendment No. 54 to Senate Bill No. 387 Page 4
24 Commissioner would also be authorized to take such action against other health insurers who
25 fail to comply with the requirements of sections 1, 3-8 and 11. (NRS 680A.200) [Section 12
26 of this bill makes a conforming change to require the Director of the Department of Health
27 and Human Services to administer the provisions of section 16 in the same manner as other
28 provisions relating to Medicaid.
29 Existing law sets forth various days, weeks or months of observance in this State. (NRS
30 236.018-236.095) Section 13 of this bill requires the Governor to annually proclaim the month
31 of November to be “Lung Cancer Awareness Month” and the second Saturday of November
32 to be “Lung Cancer Screening Day” to bring to the attention of the residents of this State
33 factual information on lung cancer.]
34 Section 17 of this bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services to: (1)
35 conduct a study to determine if the criteria adopted by the [United States Preventive Services
36 Task Force] American Cancer Society relating to screening for lung cancer creates inequities
37 in access to screening for lung cancer based on sex or gender identity or expression; and (2)
38 submit a report on its conclusions to the Director of the Legislative Counsel Bureau for
39 transmittal to the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Health and Human Services.
