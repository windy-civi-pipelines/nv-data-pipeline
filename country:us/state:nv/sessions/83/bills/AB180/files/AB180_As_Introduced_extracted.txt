Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes counties, cities and towns to issue business licenses and
2 permits to operate business within the limits of the county, city or town and to
3 collect taxes on those licenses. (NRS 244.335, 266.355, 268.095, 269.170) Existing
4 law also authorizes a board of county commissioners in a county whose population
5 is 100,000 or more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties) and the governing
6 bodies of cities within such counties to adopt ordinances regulating sidewalk
7 vendors. (NRS 244.35481, 244.35483, 268.097991, 268.097993) Section 2 of this
8 bill requires such a board of county commissioners that has adopted an ordinance
9 regulating sidewalk vendors and that requires a sidewalk vendor to hold a permit or
10 license to enter into an agreement with the city council or other governing body of
11 each incorporated city whose population is 60,000 or more located in such a county
12 (currently Sparks, North Las Vegas, Reno, Henderson and Las Vegas) for the
13 establishment of a multijurisdictional business license to allow a licensed sidewalk
14 vendor to engage in business in the county and each city.
15 Section 3 of this bill requires a board of county commissioners in each county

19 establishment of a multijurisdictional business license to allow licensed food
20 establishments operating as mobile units to engage in business in the county and
21 each city.
22 Sections 2 and 3 also require such a board of county commissioners to enter
23 into similar agreements with the governing body of each incorporated city whose
24 population is less than 60,000 in a county whose population is 100,000 or more
25 (currently Boulder City and Mesquite) who chooses to enter into such an
26 agreement. Sections 2 and 3 further require such a board of county commissioners
27 to establish by ordinance a system for issuing the business license which sets forth
28 the requirements for obtaining the license and the fees for the issuance and renewal
29 of the license.
30 Section 13 of this bill requires a city council or other governing body of an
31 incorporated city whose population is 60,000 or more (currently Sparks, North Las
32 Vegas, Reno, Henderson and Las Vegas) in a county whose population is 100,000
33 or more that has adopted an ordinance regulating sidewalk vendors and that
34 requires sidewalk vendors to hold a permit or license to enter into an agreement
35 with the board of county commissioners of the county in which the city is located
36 for the establishment of a multijurisdictional business license to allow a licensed
37 sidewalk vendor to engage in business in the county and each city.
38 Section 14 of this bill requires a city council or other governing body of an
39 incorporated city whose population is 60,000 or more in such a county to enter into
40 an agreement with the board of county commissioners of the county in which the
41 city is located for the establishment of a multijurisdictional business license to
42 allow licensed food establishments operating as mobile units to engage in business
43 in the county and each city.
44 Sections 13 and 14 also require such a city council or other governing body to
45 enter into similar agreements with the governing body of each incorporated city
46 whose population is less than 60,000 (currently Boulder City and Mesquite) who
47 chooses to enter into such an agreement. Sections 13 and 14 further require such
48 city councils and governing bodies to establish by ordinance a system for issuing
49 the business license which sets forth the requirements for obtaining the license and
50 the fees for the issuance and renewal of the license.
51 Existing law requires the board of county commissioners in a county whose
52 population is 700,000 or more (currently only Clark County) and the governing
53 body of each incorporated city whose population is 150,000 or more located in such
54 a county (currently Henderson, Las Vegas and North Las Vegas) to enter into an
55 agreement for the establishment of a business license to allow a licensed contractor,
56 under certain circumstances, to engage in the business of contracting in the county
57 and cities. (NRS 244.33501, 268.0951) Sections 5 and 15 of this bill revise the
58 population classifications to require the board of county commissioners in each
59 county whose population is 100,000 or more (currently Clark and Washoe
60 Counties) to enter into: (1) an agreement with the governing body of each city
61 whose population is 60,000 or more located within such a county (currently Sparks,

63 business licenses; and (2) similar agreements with the governing body of each
64 incorporated city whose population is less than 60,000 (currently Boulder City and
65 Mesquite) who chooses to enter into such an agreement.
66 Under existing law, the definition of “sidewalk vendor” is “a person who sells
67 food upon a public sidewalk or other pedestrian path from a conveyance.” (NRS
68 244.35482, 268.097992) Sections 7 and 17 of this bill expand this definition to
69 include a person who sells merchandise upon a public sidewalk or other pedestrian
70 path from a conveyance. Sections 9 and 19 of this bill provide that an ordinance
71 regulating sidewalk vendors may require the sidewalk vendor to provide to the
-
*AB180*

72 designated representative of the county or city a description of any merchandise the
73 sidewalk vendor offers for sale.
74 Sections 8 and 18 of this bill prohibit a board of county commissioners or
75 governing body of an incorporated city, respectively, from enacting an ordinance
76 which would prohibit, with certain exceptions, a sidewalk vendor from selling food
77 or merchandise in or adjacent to a park owned or operated by the county or city.
78 Sections 2, 3, 13, 14 and 22 of this bill provide that the information connected
79 with the issuance of a multijurisdictional business licenses for sidewalk vending is
80 confidential and is not a public record.
81 Section 4 of this bill provides that the provisions of sections 2 and 3 are an
82 exception to the authority of a board of county commissioners to regulate all
83 character of lawful trades, callings, industries, occupations, professions and
84 business conducted within the county. Sections 6 and 16 of this bill limit the
85 applicability of the provisions of sections 2 and 13 to a county whose population is
86 100,000 or more and a city located within such a county, respectively. Sections 10
87 and 20 of this bill authorize a governing body to take certain disciplinary action for
88 violations of sections 2 and 13. Sections 11 and 21 of this bill establish certain
89 limitations on the effect of sections 2 and 13.

-
*AB180*
– 21 –
1 chapter 391, Statutes of Nevada 2013 and unless otherwise declared
2 by law to be confidential, all public books and public records of a
3 governmental entity must be open at all times during office hours to
4 inspection by any person, and may be fully copied or an abstract or
5 memorandum may be prepared from those public books and public
6 records. Any such copies, abstracts or memoranda may be used to
7 supply the general public with copies, abstracts or memoranda of the
8 records or may be used in any other way to the advantage of the
9 governmental entity or of the general public. This section does not
10 supersede or in any manner affect the federal laws governing
11 copyrights or enlarge, diminish or affect in any other manner the
12 rights of a person in any written book or record which is
13 copyrighted pursuant to federal law.
14 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record
15 which is copyrighted solely because it is copyrighted.
16 3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a
17 public book or record shall not deny a request made pursuant to
18 subsection 1 to inspect or copy or receive a copy of a public book or
19 record on the basis that the requested public book or record contains
20 information that is confidential if the governmental entity can
21 redact, delete, conceal or separate, including, without limitation,
22 electronically, the confidential information from the information
23 included in the public book or record that is not otherwise
24 confidential.
25 4. If requested, a governmental entity shall provide a copy of a
26 public record in an electronic format by means of an electronic
27 medium. Nothing in this subsection requires a governmental entity
28 to provide a copy of a public record in an electronic format or by
29 means of an electronic medium if:
30 (a) The public record:
31 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
32 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
33 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by
34 means of an electronic medium would:
35 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
36 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential
37 and that cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from
38 information that is not otherwise confidential.
39 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who
40 has legal custody or control of a public record:
41 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the
42 medium that is requested because the officer, employee or agent has
43 already prepared or would prefer to provide the copy in a different
44 medium.
-
*AB180*
– 22 –
1 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon
2 request, prepare the copy of the public record and shall not require
3 the person who has requested the copy to prepare the copy himself
4 or herself.

“sidewalk vendor”; revising certain requirements relating
to the regulation of sidewalk vendors; revising the

relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes counties, cities and towns to issue business licenses and
2 permits to operate business within the limits of the county, city or town and to
3 collect taxes on those licenses. (NRS 244.335, 266.355, 268.095, 269.170) Existing
4 law also authorizes a board of county commissioners in a county whose population
5 is 100,000 or more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties) and the governing
6 bodies of cities within such counties to adopt ordinances regulating sidewalk
7 vendors. (NRS 244.35481, 244.35483, 268.097991, 268.097993) Section 2 of this
8 bill requires such a board of county commissioners that has adopted an ordinance
9 regulating sidewalk vendors and that requires a sidewalk vendor to hold a permit or
10 license to enter into an agreement with the city council or other governing body of
11 each incorporated city whose population is 60,000 or more located in such a county
12 (currently Sparks, North Las Vegas, Reno, Henderson and Las Vegas) for the
13 establishment of a multijurisdictional business license to allow a licensed sidewalk
14 vendor to engage in business in the county and each city.
15 Section 3 of this bill requires a board of county commissioners in each county
16 whose population is 100,000 or more (currently Clark and Washoe Counties) to
-

17 enter into an agreement with the city council or other governing body of each
18 incorporated city whose population is 60,000 or more in such a county for the
19 establishment of a multijurisdictional business license to allow licensed food
20 establishments operating as mobile units to engage in business in the county and
21 each city.
22 Sections 2 and 3 also require such a board of county commissioners to enter
23 into similar agreements with the governing body of each incorporated city whose
24 population is less than 60,000 in a county whose population is 100,000 or more
25 (currently Boulder City and Mesquite) who chooses to enter into such an
26 agreement. Sections 2 and 3 further require such a board of county commissioners
27 to establish by ordinance a system for issuing the business license which sets forth
28 the requirements for obtaining the license and the fees for the issuance and renewal
29 of the license.
30 Section 13 of this bill requires a city council or other governing body of an
31 incorporated city whose population is 60,000 or more (currently Sparks, North Las
32 Vegas, Reno, Henderson and Las Vegas) in a county whose population is 100,000
33 or more that has adopted an ordinance regulating sidewalk vendors and that
34 requires sidewalk vendors to hold a permit or license to enter into an agreement
35 with the board of county commissioners of the county in which the city is located
36 for the establishment of a multijurisdictional business license to allow a licensed
37 sidewalk vendor to engage in business in the county and each city.
38 Section 14 of this bill requires a city council or other governing body of an
39 incorporated city whose population is 60,000 or more in such a county to enter into
40 an agreement with the board of county commissioners of the county in which the
41 city is located for the establishment of a multijurisdictional business license to
42 allow licensed food establishments operating as mobile units to engage in business
43 in the county and each city.
44 Sections 13 and 14 also require such a city council or other governing body to
45 enter into similar agreements with the governing body of each incorporated city
46 whose population is less than 60,000 (currently Boulder City and Mesquite) who
47 chooses to enter into such an agreement. Sections 13 and 14 further require such
48 city councils and governing bodies to establish by ordinance a system for issuing
49 the business license which sets forth the requirements for obtaining the license and
50 the fees for the issuance and renewal of the license.
51 Existing law requires the board of county commissioners in a county whose
52 population is 700,000 or more (currently only Clark County) and the governing
53 body of each incorporated city whose population is 150,000 or more located in such
54 a county (currently Henderson, Las Vegas and North Las Vegas) to enter into an
55 agreement for the establishment of a business license to allow a licensed contractor,
56 under certain circumstances, to engage in the business of contracting in the county
57 and cities. (NRS 244.33501, 268.0951) Sections 5 and 15 of this bill revise the
58 population classifications to require the board of county commissioners in each
59 county whose population is 100,000 or more (currently Clark and Washoe
60 Counties) to enter into: (1) an agreement with the governing body of each city
61 whose population is 60,000 or more located within such a county (currently Sparks,
62 North Las Vegas, Reno, Henderson and Las Vegas) for the establishment of such
63 business licenses; and (2) similar agreements with the governing body of each
64 incorporated city whose population is less than 60,000 (currently Boulder City and
65 Mesquite) who chooses to enter into such an agreement.
66 Under existing law, the definition of “sidewalk vendor” is “a person who sells
67 food upon a public sidewalk or other pedestrian path from a conveyance.” (NRS
68 244.35482, 268.097992) Sections 7 and 17 of this bill expand this definition to
69 include a person who sells merchandise upon a public sidewalk or other pedestrian
70 path from a conveyance. Sections 9 and 19 of this bill provide that an ordinance
71 regulating sidewalk vendors may require the sidewalk vendor to provide to the
-
*AB180*

– 3 –
72 designated representative of the county or city a description of any merchandise the
73 sidewalk vendor offers for sale.
74 Sections 8 and 18 of this bill prohibit a board of county commissioners or
75 governing body of an incorporated city, respectively, from enacting an ordinance
76 which would prohibit, with certain exceptions, a sidewalk vendor from selling food
77 or merchandise in or adjacent to a park owned or operated by the county or city.
78 Sections 2, 3, 13, 14 and 22 of this bill provide that the information connected
79 with the issuance of a multijurisdictional business licenses for sidewalk vending is
80 confidential and is not a public record.
81 Section 4 of this bill provides that the provisions of sections 2 and 3 are an
82 exception to the authority of a board of county commissioners to regulate all
83 character of lawful trades, callings, industries, occupations, professions and
84 business conducted within the county. Sections 6 and 16 of this bill limit the
85 applicability of the provisions of sections 2 and 13 to a county whose population is
86 100,000 or more and a city located within such a county, respectively. Sections 10
87 and 20 of this bill authorize a governing body to take certain disciplinary action for
88 violations of sections 2 and 13. Sections 11 and 21 of this bill establish certain
89 limitations on the effect of sections 2 and 13.

– 21 –
1 chapter 391, Statutes of Nevada 2013 and unless otherwise declared
2 by law to be confidential, all public books and public records of a
3 governmental entity must be open at all times during office hours to
4 inspection by any person, and may be fully copied or an abstract or
5 memorandum may be prepared from those public books and public
6 records. Any such copies, abstracts or memoranda may be used to
7 supply the general public with copies, abstracts or memoranda of the
8 records or may be used in any other way to the advantage of the
9 governmental entity or of the general public. This section does not
10 supersede or in any manner affect the federal laws governing
11 copyrights or enlarge, diminish or affect in any other manner the
12 rights of a person in any written book or record which is
13 copyrighted pursuant to federal law.
14 2. A governmental entity may not reject a book or record
15 which is copyrighted solely because it is copyrighted.
16 3. A governmental entity that has legal custody or control of a
17 public book or record shall not deny a request made pursuant to
18 subsection 1 to inspect or copy or receive a copy of a public book or
19 record on the basis that the requested public book or record contains
20 information that is confidential if the governmental entity can
21 redact, delete, conceal or separate, including, without limitation,
22 electronically, the confidential information from the information
23 included in the public book or record that is not otherwise
24 confidential.
25 4. If requested, a governmental entity shall provide a copy of a
26 public record in an electronic format by means of an electronic
27 medium. Nothing in this subsection requires a governmental entity
28 to provide a copy of a public record in an electronic format or by
29 means of an electronic medium if:
30 (a) The public record:
31 (1) Was not created or prepared in an electronic format; and
32 (2) Is not available in an electronic format; or
33 (b) Providing the public record in an electronic format or by
34 means of an electronic medium would:
35 (1) Give access to proprietary software; or
36 (2) Require the production of information that is confidential
37 and that cannot be redacted, deleted, concealed or separated from
38 information that is not otherwise confidential.
39 5. An officer, employee or agent of a governmental entity who
40 has legal custody or control of a public record:
41 (a) Shall not refuse to provide a copy of that public record in the
42 medium that is requested because the officer, employee or agent has
43 already prepared or would prefer to provide the copy in a different
44 medium.
-
*AB180*

– 22 –
1 (b) Except as otherwise provided in NRS 239.030, shall, upon
2 request, prepare the copy of the public record and shall not require
3 the person who has requested the copy to prepare the copy himself
4 or herself.
