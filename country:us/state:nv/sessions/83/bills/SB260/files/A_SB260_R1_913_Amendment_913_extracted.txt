EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to employment; [establishing] requiring the Administrator of
the Division of Industrial Relations of the Department of Business
and Industry to adopt certain regulations prescribing requirements
for certain employers relating to the exposure of certain employees to
poor air quality from wildfire smoke in the workplace; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires certain employers to establish and implement a written safety
2 program that includes the establishment of a training program concerning safety in the
3 workplace. (NRS 618.383) Section 1 of this bill [requires certain employers to also: (1)
4 establish and implement a program to mitigate the exposure of employees who occasionally,
5 frequently or constantly perform critical tasks outdoors to poor air quality from wildfire
6 smoke and to monitor such employees for signs of health effects caused by exposure to poor
7 air quality from wildfire smoke; and (2) provide training to such employees on the program
8 and the potential hazards of not using personal protection equipment while working outdoors
9 and being exposed to poor air quality from wildfire smoke. Section 1 also requires the
10 employer to monitor air quality before and as conditions change during each shift of an
11 employee who occasionally, frequently or constantly performs critical tasks outdoors. Section
12 1 further] requires the Administrator of the Division of Industrial Relations of the Department
13 of Business and Industry to establish by regulation measures that an employer must take to
14 reduce the exposure of an employee to poor air quality from wildfire smoke where the air
15 quality index is: (1) 150 or more but less than 200; and (2) 200 or more. The Administrator is
16 also required to establish by regulation an air quality index level caused by wildfire smoke at
17 which an employer is prohibited from allowing an employee to perform critical tasks
18 outdoors. Section 1 further requires each employer to establish a communications system that:
19 (1) informs an employee when the employee is being exposed to certain poor air quality; and
20 (2) allows any employee to report to the employer the presence of such poor air quality and
Senate Amendment No. 913 to Senate Bill No. 260 First Reprint Page 4
21 any symptom experienced by the employee that may be caused by such exposure. Section 1
22 further requires the Administrator to adopt regulations: (1) concerning the
23 implementation of such a communication system; and (2) that prescribe standards for
24 training that certain employers are required to provide to certain employees.
25 Additionally, section 1 prohibits the regulations adopted by the Administrator from
26 imposing additional liability on an employer for the purposes of certain policies of
27 insurance. Finally, section 1 provides that these requirements do not apply to any employer
28 that: (1) is an operator of a mine; (2) employs commercial truck drivers; (3) is a provider of
29 emergency services; or (4) has 10 or fewer employees.
