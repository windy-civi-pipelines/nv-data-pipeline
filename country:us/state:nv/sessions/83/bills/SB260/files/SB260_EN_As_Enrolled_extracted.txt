Division of Industrial Relations of the Department of
Business and Industry to adopt certain regulations prescribing
requirements for certain employers relating to the exposure of
certain employees to poor air quality from wildfire smoke in
the workplace; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law requires certain employers to establish and implement a written
safety program that includes the establishment of a training program concerning
safety in the workplace. (NRS 618.383) Section 1 of this bill requires the
Administrator of the Division of Industrial Relations of the Department of Business
and Industry to establish by regulation measures that an employer must take to
reduce the exposure of an employee to poor air quality from wildfire smoke where
the air quality index is: (1) 150 or more but less than 200; and (2) 200 or more. The
Administrator is also required to establish by regulation an air quality index level
caused by wildfire smoke at which an employer is prohibited from allowing an
employee to perform critical tasks outdoors. Section 1 further requires each
employer to establish a communications system that: (1) informs an employee
when the employee is being exposed to certain poor air quality; and (2) allows any
employee to report to the employer the presence of such poor air quality and any
symptom experienced by the employee that may be caused by such exposure.

Section 2:
Section 1 further requires the Administrator to adopt regulations: (1) concerning
the implementation of such a communication system; and (2) that prescribe
standards for training that certain employers are required to provide to certain
employees. Additionally, section 1 prohibits the regulations adopted by the
Administrator from imposing additional liability on an employer for the purposes of
certain policies of insurance. Finally, section 1 provides that these requirements do
not apply to any employer that: (1) is an operator of a mine; (2) employs
commercial truck drivers; (3) is a provider of emergency services; or (4) has 10 or
fewer employees.
