AN ACT relating to employment; establishing requirements for
certain employers relating to the exposure of certain
employees to poor air quality from wildfire smoke in the
workplace; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires certain employers to establish and implement a written
2 safety program that includes the establishment of a training program concerning
3 safety in the workplace. (NRS 618.383) Section 1 of this bill requires certain
4 employers to also: (1) establish and implement a program to mitigate the exposure
5 of employees who occasionally, frequently or constantly perform critical tasks
6 outdoors to poor air quality from wildfire smoke and to monitor such employees for
7 signs of health effects caused by exposure to poor air quality from wildfire smoke;
8 and (2) provide training to such employees on the program and the potential
9 hazards of not using personal protection equipment while working outdoors and
10 being exposed to poor air quality from wildfire smoke. Section 1 also requires the
11 employer to monitor air quality before and as conditions change during each shift
12 of an employee who occasionally, frequently or constantly performs critical tasks
13 outdoors. Section 1 further requires the Administrator of the Division of Industrial
14 Relations of the Department of Business and Industry to establish measures that an
15 employer must take to reduce the exposure of an employee to poor air quality from
16 wildfire smoke where the air quality index is: (1) 150 or more but less than 200;

– 2 –
17 and (2) 200 or more. The Administrator is also required to establish an air quality
18 index level caused by wildfire smoke at which an employer is prohibited from
19 allowing an employee to perform critical tasks outdoors. Section 1 further requires
20 each employer to establish a communications system that: (1) informs an employee
21 when the employee is being exposed to certain poor air quality; and (2) allows any
22 employee to report to the employer the presence of such poor air quality and any
23 symptom experienced by the employee that may be caused by such exposure.
24 Finally, section 1 provides that these requirements do not apply to any employer
25 that: (1) is an operator of a mine; (2) employs commercial truck drivers; (3) is a
26 provider of emergency services; or (4) has 10 or fewer employees.
