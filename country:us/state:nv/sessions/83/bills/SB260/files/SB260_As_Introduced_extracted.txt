EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to employment; establishing requirements for
certain employers relating to the exposure of employees
to poor air quality in the workplace; prohibiting an
employer from disciplining or retaliating against an
employee who reports certain information relating to poor
air quality; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires certain employers to establish and implement a written
2 safety program that includes the establishment of a training program concerning
3 safety in the workplace. (NRS 618.383) Section 1 of this bill requires certain
4 employers to also: (1) establish and implement a program to mitigate the exposure
5 of employees to poor air quality and to monitor employees for signs of health
6 effects caused by exposure to poor air quality; and (2) provide training to
7 employees on the program and the potential hazards of not using personal
8 protection equipment while working and being exposed to poor air quality. Section
9 1 also requires the employer to: (1) monitor air quality; and (2) take certain actions
10 when an employee is exposed to air quality where the level of particulate matter in
11 the atmosphere, commonly known as PM2.5 levels, exceed 150. Section 1 requires
12 each employer to establish a communications system that: (1) informs an employee
13 when the employee is being exposed to such poor air quality; and (2) allows any
14 employee to report to the employer the presence of such poor air quality and any
-

15 symptom experienced by the employee that may be caused by such exposure.
16 Section 1 prohibits an employer from disciplining or retaliating against any
17 employee who reports to the employer the presence in the employee’s workspace of
18 air quality where PM2.5 levels exceed an air quality index of 150 or any symptom
19 experienced by the employee that may be caused by exposure to such air quality.
20 Finally, section 1 provides that these requirements do not apply to any employer
21 that: (1) is a provider of emergency services; or (2) has 10 or fewer employees,
22 unless the employer has employees who work in an environment where the
23 employees may be exposed to certain poor levels of air quality.
