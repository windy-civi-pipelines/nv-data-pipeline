EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to employment; establishing requirements for certain employers
relating to the exposure of certain employees to poor air quality from
wildfire smoke in the workplace; [prohibiting an employer from
disciplining or retaliating against an employee who reports certain
information relating to poor air quality;] and providing other matters
properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires certain employers to establish and implement a written safety
2 program that includes the establishment of a training program concerning safety in the
3 workplace. (NRS 618.383) Section 1 of this bill requires certain employers to also: (1)
4 establish and implement a program to mitigate the exposure of employees who occasionally,
5 frequently or constantly perform critical tasks outdoors to poor air quality from wildfire
6 smoke and to monitor such employees for signs of health effects caused by exposure to poor
7 air quality [;] from wildfire smoke; and (2) provide training to such employees on the
8 program and the potential hazards of not using personal protection equipment while working
9 outdoors and being exposed to poor air quality [.] from wildfire smoke. Section 1 also
10 requires the employer to [: (1)] monitor air quality [; and (2) take certain actions when] before
11 and as conditions change during each shift of an employee [is exposed to air quality where
12 the level of particulate matter in the atmosphere, commonly known as PM2.5 levels, exceed]
13 who occasionally, frequently or constantly performs critical tasks outdoors. Section 1
14 further requires the Administrator of the Division of Industrial Relations of the
15 Department of Business and Industry to establish measures that an employer must take
16 to reduce the exposure of an employee to poor air quality from wildfire smoke where the
17 air quality index is: (1) 150 [.] or more but less than 200; and (2) 200 or more. The
18 Administrator is also required to establish an air quality index level caused by wildfire
19 smoke at which an employer is prohibited from allowing an employee to perform critical
20 tasks outdoors. Section 1 further requires each employer to establish a communications
Senate Amendment No. 535 to Senate Bill No. 260 Page 4
21 system that: (1) informs an employee when the employee is being exposed to [such] certain
22 poor air quality; and (2) allows any employee to report to the employer the presence of such
23 poor air quality and any symptom experienced by the employee that may be caused by such
24 exposure. [Section 1 prohibits an employer from disciplining or retaliating against any
25 employee who reports to the employer the presence in the employee’s workspace of air
26 quality where PM2.5 levels exceed an air quality index of 150 or any symptom experienced
27 by the employee that may be caused by exposure to such air quality.] Finally, section 1
28 provides that these requirements do not apply to any employer that: (1) is an operator of a
29 mine; (2) employs commercial truck drivers; (3) is a provider of emergency services; or
30 [(2)] (4) has 10 or fewer employees . [, unless the employer has employees who work in an
31 environment where the employees may be exposed to certain poor levels of air quality.]

24 (b) Determining] determining the Environmental Protection Agency Air
