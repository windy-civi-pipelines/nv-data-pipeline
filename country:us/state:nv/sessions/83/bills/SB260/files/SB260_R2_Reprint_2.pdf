AN ACT relating to employment; requiring the Administrator of the
Division of Industrial Relations of the Department of
Business and Industry to adopt certain regulations
prescribing requirements for certain employers relating to
the exposure of certain employees to poor air quality from
wildfire smoke in the workplace; and providing other
matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires certain employers to establish and implement a written
2 safety program that includes the establishment of a training program concerning
3 safety in the workplace. (NRS 618.383) Section 1 of this bill requires the
4 Administrator of the Division of Industrial Relations of the Department of Business
5 and Industry to establish by regulation measures that an employer must take to
6 reduce the exposure of an employee to poor air quality from wildfire smoke where
7 the air quality index is: (1) 150 or more but less than 200; and (2) 200 or more. The
8 Administrator is also required to establish by regulation an air quality index level
9 caused by wildfire smoke at which an employer is prohibited from allowing an
10 employee to perform critical tasks outdoors. Section 1 further requires each
11 employer to establish a communications system that: (1) informs an employee
12 when the employee is being exposed to certain poor air quality; and (2) allows any
13 employee to report to the employer the presence of such poor air quality and any
14 symptom experienced by the employee that may be caused by such exposure.

15 Section 1 further requires the Administrator to adopt regulations: (1) concerning
16 the implementation of such a communication system; and (2) that prescribe
17 standards for training that certain employers are required to provide to certain
18 employees. Additionally, section 1 prohibits the regulations adopted by the
19 Administrator from imposing additional liability on an employer for the purposes of
20 certain policies of insurance. Finally, section 1 provides that these requirements do
21 not apply to any employer that: (1) is an operator of a mine; (2) employs
22 commercial truck drivers; (3) is a provider of emergency services; or (4) has 10 or
23 fewer employees.
