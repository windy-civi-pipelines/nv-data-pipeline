EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to governmental administration; revising in
skeleton form the powers and duties of the Office of
Nevada Boards, Commissions and Councils Standards of
the Department of Business and Industry; making various
changes in skeleton form to the composition and
operation of various boards, commissions, councils and
similar bodies; providing in skeleton form for the
consolidation and termination of various boards,
commissions, councils and similar bodies; and providing
other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law creates the Office of Nevada Boards, Commissions and Councils
2 Standards of the Department of Business and Industry and sets forth the powers and
3 duties of the Office. (NRS 232.8413, 232.8415) This bill revises, in skeleton form,
4 the powers and duties of the Office.
5 Existing law provides, with certain exceptions, that all professional and
6 occupational licensing boards created by the Legislature are under the purview of
7 the Office. (NRS 232.8415) Section 24 of this bill adds various other boards,
8 commissions, councils and similar bodies within the Executive Department of the
9 State Government to the purview of the Office. Section 11 of this bill requires the
10 Office to provide administrative services to each board, commission, council and
11 similar body under its purview, including, without limitation, legal services,
12 accounting services, information technology services, services pertaining to
13 activities designed to influence the passage or defeat of any legislation and the
-

– 2 –
14 services of hearing officers to adjudicate contested cases. Section 11 requires the
15 Office to prescribe a fee to cover the costs for such services and adopt such
16 procedures as the Office may deem appropriate for the billing or collection of such
17 fees from a board, commission, council or similar body to which such services are
18 provided. Section 11 prohibits a board, commission, council or similar body under
19 the purview of the Office from paying any compensation to a natural person or
20 entity other than the Office for a service that the Office provides. This bill would
21 eliminate all provisions of existing law to the contrary. For example, existing law
22 requires a regulatory body to determine whether a contested case will be heard by
23 the regulatory body or a hearing panel or officer. (NRS 622A.300) Section 79 of
24 this bill requires any contested case before a regulatory body that is a professional
25 or occupational licensing board under the purview of the Office to be heard by a
26 hearing officer employed by the Office. Similarly, section 83 of this bill eliminates
27 the authority of the Nevada State Board of Accountancy to employ attorneys, as
28 legal services for the Board would be provided by the Office.
29 Section 11 requires all money collected by the Office for the provision of
30 services to boards, commissions, councils and similar bodies under its purview to
31 be deposited in the State Treasury for credit to the Office of Nevada Boards,
32 Commissions and Councils Standards Account, which is created by section 12 of
33 this bill.
34 Existing law requires the Director of the Department of Business and Industry
35 to retain the required staff to effectively administer the responsibilities of the
36 Office. (NRS 232.8413) Section 23 of this bill provides that such staff may include,
37 without limitation, hearing officers, accountants and other professional, clerical and
38 operational employees. Section 6 of this bill authorizes the Director to appoint a
39 General Counsel of the Office and deputies to the General Counsel.
40 Section 15 of this bill: (1) requires the Office to maintain an Internet website
41 through which each board, commission, council and similar body under the
42 purview of the Office may post information; and (2) prohibits such a board,
43 commission, council or similar body from posting information on any other Internet
44 website. The bill would eliminate any provisions of existing law to the contrary.
45 For example, existing law requires the Nevada State Board of Accountancy to
46 maintain a website on the Internet and post certain information on that website.
47 (NRS 628.130) Section 84 of this bill requires that information to instead be posted
48 on the Internet website maintained by the Office.
49 Section 13 of this bill sets forth the process that a board, commission, council
50 or similar body under the purview of the Office must use if it wishes that a request
51 for the drafting of a legislative measure be submitted to the Legislative Counsel.
52 Sections 7-9 of this bill require the Office, with certain exceptions, to
53 periodically review each board, commission, council and similar body in this State
54 within the Executive Department of the State Government and set forth procedures
55 for conducting such a review. At the conclusion of such a review, section 9
56 requires the Deputy Director to submit to the Governor his or her recommendation
57 as to whether the board, commission, council or similar body should be terminated,
58 modified, consolidated with another board, commission, council or similar body or
59 continued. Section 9 requires the Governor, if necessary, to request the drafting of
60 a legislative measure to effectuate the recommendation. If the board, commission,
61 council or similar body is an advisory body subject to termination pursuant to
62 section 29 of this bill and the Deputy Director makes certain specified findings
63 concerning the advisory body, section 9 requires the Deputy Director to submit a
64 notice to the Governor and the Director of the Legislative Counsel
65 Bureau recommending the continuation of the board, commission, council or
66 similar body.
67 Section 29 requires any legislative measure enacted on or after July 1, 2026,
68 which contains a provision creating an advisory body, with certain exceptions, to
-
*SB78*

– 3 –
69 provide for the expiration by limitation of the provision 2 years after effective date
70 of the provision. However, section 29 also requires such legislation to provide for
71 the extension of the provision for a period of 2 years each time the Deputy Director
72 submits a notice to the Governor and the Director of the Legislative Counsel
73 Bureau described in section 9 recommending the continuation of the advisory
74 body. As such, under section 29, any advisory body created on or after July 1,
75 2026, would terminate automatically after 2 years, but may be extended in 2-year
76 increments if the Deputy Director, after a review of the advisory body, makes
77 certain findings resulting in a recommendation for the continuation of the advisory
78 body.
79 Section 10 of this bill authorizes the Office to: (1) establish procedures and
80 requirements relating to the appointment of members to a board, commission,
81 council or similar body under the purview of the Office; and (2) require any such
82 body, before entering into a contract of any kind, to submit the contract to and
83 obtain the approval of the Office.
84 Section 14 of this bill makes the person appointed by the Governor as the
85 administrative head of the department within which a board, commission, council
86 or similar body under the purview of the Office, other than a professional or
87 occupational licensing board, responsible for the effective operation of the board,
88 commission, council or similar body. Section 14 provides that such boards,
89 commissions, councils or similar bodies are authorized to meet only upon: (1) the
90 call of the Chair of the board, commission, council or similar body; (2) the written
91 request of a majority of the members of the board, commission, council or similar
92 body; or (3) the call of the administrative head of the department responsible for its
93 effective operation. This bill would eliminate all provisions of existing law to the
94 contrary. For example, section 21 of this bill removes provisions requiring the
95 Advisory Council of the Division of Industrial Relations of the Department of
96 Business and Industry to meet at least once annually. (NRS 232.580) All similar
97 provisions requiring a board, commission, council or similar body under the
98 purview of the Office that is not a professional or occupational licensing board to
99 meet a certain number of times per year would be eliminated.
100 Section 16 of this bill authorizes the Office to have access to, inspect, copy and
101 subpoena various records and use the information obtained to resolve matters
102 relating to its duties.
103 This bill also provides, in skeleton form, for various revisions to provisions
104 relating to the membership of various boards, commissions, councils and similar
105 bodies under the purview of the Office. For example, under existing law, the
106 members of the Advisory Council of the Division of Industrial Relations are
107 appointed by the Governor. (NRS 232.570) Section 20 of this bill makes the
108 Director of the Department of Business and Industry responsible for appointing
109 the members of the Advisory Council. This bill would similarly make the
110 administrative head of the department in which a board, commission, council or
111 similar body under the purview of the Office that is not a professional or
112 occupational licensing board responsible for the appointment of the members
113 required to be appointed by the Governor under existing law. Section 20 also
114 provides that the term of office for a member of the Advisory Council is 2 years
115 and that a member may not serve more than two terms. This bill would apply those
116 term limits and terms of office to every board, commission, council or similar body
117 under the purview of the Office that is not a professional or occupational licensing
118 board.
119 This bill would also standardize the term limits and terms of office for
120 professional and occupational licensing boards under the purview of the Office. For
121 example, under existing law, a member of the State Contractors’ Board serves a
122 term of 3 years and is not limited in the number of terms he or she may serve. (NRS
123 232A.020, chapter 624 of NRS) However, an appointed member of the State
-
*SB78*

– 4 –
124 Barbers’ Health and Sanitation Board serves a term of 4 years and is prohibited
125 from serving more than three terms. (NRS 643.020) Sections 81 and 94 of this bill
126 provide that the term of office for the appointed members of both of these boards is
127 4 years and each such member is prohibited from serving more than two terms.
128 This bill would apply such term limits and terms of office to every professional and
129 occupational licensing board under the purview of the Office.
130 This bill would also standardize the compensation to be paid to members of the
131 boards, commissions, councils and similar bodies under the purview of the Office.
132 For example, under existing law, each member of the Advisory Council of the
133 Division of Industrial Relations is entitled to receive a salary of $60 for each day’s
134 attendance at a meeting of the Council. (NRS 232.590) Section 22 of this bill
135 requires the members to serve without compensation, but provides that each
136 member is entitled to receive the per diem allowance and travel expenses provided
137 for state officers and employees generally. This bill would require all members of
138 all boards, commissions, councils and similar bodies under the purview of the
139 Office, other than a professional or occupational licensing board, to serve without
140 compensation. However, each member would be entitled to receive the per diem
141 allowance and travel expenses provided for state officers and employees generally.
142 This bill would also standardize the compensation to be paid to members of
143 professional and occupational licensing boards under the purview of the Office. For
144 example, under existing law, each member of the State Board of Pharmacy is
145 entitled to receive: (1) a salary of not more than $150 per day, as fixed by the
146 Board, while engaged in the business of the Board; and (2) a per diem allowance
147 and travel expenses at a rate fixed by the Board, while engaged in the business of
148 the Board, which must not exceed the rate provided for state officers and
149 employees generally. (NRS 639.050) Section 92 of this bill requires those rates to
150 be fixed by the Deputy Director of the Office, with the approval of the Director of
151 the Department of Business and Industry, rather than the Board. This bill would add
152 similar provisions with respect to every professional and occupational licensing
153 board under the purview of the Office.
154 In addition to requiring each board, commission, council or similar body under
155 its purview to utilize the administrative services of the Office, this bill would
156 require the Director of the Department of Business and Industry to appoint each
157 executive director of a professional or occupational licensing board, rather than the
158 board itself. For example, existing law authorizes the State Board of Nursing to
159 appoint an Executive Director to perform such duties as the Board may direct and
160 to set the compensation of the Executive Director. (NRS 632.060) Section 88 of
161 this bill requires the Executive Director to instead be appointed by the Director of
162 the Department of Business and Industry and to serve at a level of compensation set
163 by the Deputy Director of the Office. Under section 88, the Executive Director of
164 the Board serves at the pleasure of the Director and is required to perform such
165 duties as are directed by the Deputy Director, as advised by the Board. This bill
166 would add similar provisions with respect to each executive director or person with
167 similar responsibilities of each professional or occupational licensing board.
168 Section 88 also eliminates a requirement specific to the State Board of Nursing that
169 requires the Executive Director of the Board to be a professional nurse licensed in
170 this State.
171 Section 87 of this bill authorizes the Board of Dental Examiners of Nevada, by
172 regulation, to defer the expiration of a license issued by the Board to a person who
173 is on active duty in any branch of the Armed Forces of the United States or who is
174 the spouse or dependent child of such a person. This bill would similarly authorize
175 every professional and occupational licensing board under the purview of the
176 Office to take such action.
177 Existing law creates the Commission on Postsecondary Education within the
178 Employment Security Division of the Department of Employment, Training and
-
*SB78*

– 5 –
179 Rehabilitation and makes the Administrator of the Division, through the
180 Administrator of the Commission, responsible for the administration of provisions
181 of existing law governing the licensure and regulation of certain academic,
182 vocational, technical and business schools and privately owned colleges and
183 universities. (NRS 394.383, 612.220) Sections 50 and 73 of this bill: (1) move the
184 Commission from within the Employment Security Division to be within
185 the Department of Business and Industry; (2) revise the membership of the
186 Commission to replace a nonvoting member who is an employee of the Department
187 of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation with a nonvoting member who is an
188 employee of the Department of Business and Industry; and (3) eliminate the
189 responsibility of the Administrator of the Employment Security Division with
190 respect to the provisions of existing law governing the licensure and regulation of
191 certain schools, colleges and universities.
192 Section 25 of this bill requires the Office of Minority Health and Equity of the
193 Department of Health and Human Services, rather the Director of the Department
194 of Business and Industry, to provide staff assistance to the Nevada Commission on
195 Minority Affairs, except for those services provided by the Office pursuant to
196 section 11.
197 This bill would eliminate, consolidate or revise the membership of various
198 boards, commissions, councils and similar bodies both under and outside the
199 purview of the Office.
200 The Nevada Air Service Development Commission would be eliminated and its
201 duties transferred to the Nevada Aviation Technical Advisory Committee. (NRS
202 231.600-231.700) For example, section 1 of this bill transfers the duty to
203 administer the Nevada Air Service Development Fund and to adopt certain
204 regulations from the Commission to the Nevada Aviation Technical Advisory
205 Committee.
206 The Nevada Commission for Persons Who Are Deaf and Hard of Hearing
207 would be eliminated and its duties transferred to the Nevada Equal Rights
208 Commission. (NRS 233.030, 427A.750) Section 26 of this bill revises the
209 membership of the Nevada Equal Rights Commission.
210 The State Historical Records Advisory Board and the Committee to Approve
211 Schedules for the Retention and Disposition of Official State Records would be
212 eliminated. (NRS 239.073, 378A.030) The duties of those bodies would be
213 transferred to the State Records and Historical Advisory Council created by section
214 30 of this bill.
215 The Human Resources Commission, the Employee-Management Committee
216 and Committee on Catastrophic Leave would be eliminated. (NRS 284.030,
217 284.068, 284.3627) The duties of those bodies would be transferred to the
218 Committee on Human Resources created by section 31 of this bill.

220 selection committee for nominations of persons to receive the Nevada Medal of

222 those bodies would be transferred to the Nevada Merit and Honors Board created
223 by section 32 of this bill.
224 The Commission for Cultural Centers and Historic Preservation and the
225 Comstock Historic District Commission would be eliminated. (NRS 383.500,

227 for Cultural and Historic Preservation created by section 37 of this bill.

229 State Teacher and Education Support Professional Recruitment and Retention
230 Advisory Task Force would be eliminated. (NRS 385.910, 391.492) The duties of
231 those bodies would be transferred to the Nevada Commission on Innovation,

233 bill.

237 Committee on School and Staff Safety created by section 43 of this bill.

251 Existing federal regulations require that the State Plan for Medicaid provide for
252 a Medicaid Advisory Committee and a Beneficiary Advisory Council to advise the
253 state agency for the Medicaid program on matters of concern related to policy
254 development and matters related to the effective administration of the Medicaid
255 program. (42 C.F.R. § 431.12) Sections 55-58 of this bill establish such a Medicaid
256 Advisory Committee and Beneficiary Advisory Council and set forth the duties of
257 those bodies. This bill would eliminate the Medical Care Advisory Committee and
