EXPLANATION – Matter in bolded italics is new; matter between brackets [omitted material] is material to be omitted.
AN ACT relating to utilities; requiring broadband providers to enter
into agreements with local governments to access the
public right-of-way managed by the local government;
requiring such agreements to be performed in a
nondiscriminatory matter; establishing certain
compensation requirements under agreements between
broadband providers and local governments; and
providing other matters properly relating thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law authorizes a board of county commissioners to grant certain public
2 utilities the franchise, right and privilege to construct, install, operate and maintain
3 lines, mains and other utility equipment in any unincorporated town in the county
4 and along the public roads and highways of the county. (NRS 709.050) Existing
5 law also authorizes a local government to: (1) manage the use of any public right-
6 of-way or highway by video service providers; and (2) require a video service
7 provider to pay a franchise fee for the privilege of providing video service through
8 a network that occupies or uses any public right-of-way or highway within the
9 jurisdiction of the local government. (NRS 711.640, 711.670) Section 17.5 of this
10 bill provides that a broadband provider may not access the public right-of-way of a
11 local government responsible for the management of the public right-of-way on or
12 after July 1, 2026, unless the broadband provider has entered into an agreement
13 with the local government with respect to access to the right-of-way. Section 17.5
14 requires a local government to execute and perform agreements with broadband
15 providers in a nondiscriminatory manner. Section 17.5 requires an agreement
16 between a broadband provider and local government to provide for compensation to
17 be paid to the local government, which must not exceed 2 percent of the annual
18 gross revenue derived by the broadband provider from providing broadband

19 service, broadband infrastructure access or both broadband service and broadband
20 infrastructure access within the jurisdiction of the local government that manages
21 the right-of-way. Section 19.5 of this bill prohibits a local government from
22 suspending or revoking a broadband provider’s access to the public right-of-way
23 managed by the local government on the basis that the broadband provider has not
24 entered into an agreement with the local government pursuant to section 17.5,
25 unless such suspension or revocation occurs after July 1, 2026.
26 Section 17.5 excludes from the definition of “broadband provider” certain
27 persons who are: (1) authorized to act as a video service provider or to construct
28 and operate a video service network; (2) providers of basic network service; and (3)
29 providers of commercial mobile radio service. Section 18 of this bill excludes any
30 fee imposed by a local government pursuant to an agreement with a broadband
31 provider in accordance with section 17.5 from certain prohibitions on the ability of
32 the local government to adopt or increase certain other fees for business licenses.

39 population of the local government added to the percentage increase
40 in the Consumer Price Index for the year ending on December 31
41 next preceding the year for which the limit is being calculated. The

45 license which is calculated as a fraction or percentage of the gross

16 business license of the local government is substantially below that
17 of other local governments in the State.
