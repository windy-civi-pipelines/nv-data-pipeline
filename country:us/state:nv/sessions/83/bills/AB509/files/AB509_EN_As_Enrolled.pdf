Assembly Bill No. 509–Committee
on Commerce and Labor
CHAPTER..........
AN ACT relating to utilities; requiring broadband providers to enter
into agreements with local governments to access the public
right-of-way managed by the local government; requiring
such agreements to be performed in a nondiscriminatory
matter; establishing certain compensation requirements under
agreements between broadband providers and local
governments; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
Existing law authorizes a board of county commissioners to grant certain public
utilities the franchise, right and privilege to construct, install, operate and maintain
lines, mains and other utility equipment in any unincorporated town in the county
and along the public roads and highways of the county. (NRS 709.050) Existing
law also authorizes a local government to: (1) manage the use of any public right-
of-way or highway by video service providers; and (2) require a video service
provider to pay a franchise fee for the privilege of providing video service through
a network that occupies or uses any public right-of-way or highway within the
jurisdiction of the local government. (NRS 711.640, 711.670) Section 17.5 of this
bill provides that a broadband provider may not access the public right-of-way of a
local government responsible for the management of the public right-of-way on or
after July 1, 2026, unless the broadband provider has entered into an agreement
with the local government with respect to access to the right-of-way. Section 17.5
requires a local government to execute and perform agreements with broadband
providers in a nondiscriminatory manner. Section 17.5 requires an agreement
between a broadband provider and local government to provide for compensation to
be paid to the local government, which must not exceed 2 percent of the annual
gross revenue derived by the broadband provider from providing broadband
service, broadband infrastructure access or both broadband service and broadband
infrastructure access within the jurisdiction of the local government that manages
the right-of-way. Section 19.5 of this bill prohibits a local government from
suspending or revoking a broadband provider’s access to the public right-of-way
managed by the local government on the basis that the broadband provider has not
entered into an agreement with the local government pursuant to section 17.5,
unless such suspension or revocation occurs after July 1, 2026.
Section 17.5 excludes from the definition of “broadband provider” certain
persons who are: (1) authorized to act as a video service provider or to construct
and operate a video service network; (2) providers of basic network service; and (3)
providers of commercial mobile radio service. Section 18 of this bill excludes any
fee imposed by a local government pursuant to an agreement with a broadband
provider in accordance with section 17.5 from certain prohibitions on the ability of
the local government to adopt or increase certain other fees for business licenses.

[(d)] (e) For business licenses which are calculated as a fraction
or percentage of the gross revenue of the business;

business license of the local government is substantially below that
of other local governments in the State.
