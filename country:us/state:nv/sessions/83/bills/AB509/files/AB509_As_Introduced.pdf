AN ACT relating to utilities; requiring the Public Utilities
Commission of Nevada to annually review whether
certain persons that hold a certificate of public
convenience and necessity continue to operate as a public
utility; exempting certain persons that provide
telecommunication service from regulation by the
Commission; authorizing local governments to grant
franchises and impose certain fees for the use and
occupation of the public right-of-way or highway by
broadband service providers and broadband infrastructure
providers; and providing other matters properly relating
thereto.
Legislative Counsel’s Digest:
1 Existing law requires the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada to regulate
2 public utilities that provide telecommunication service to the public. (Chapter 704
3 of NRS) Existing law requires any person who owns, controls, operates, maintains
4 or has any contemplation of owning, controlling or operating a public utility to
5 obtain a certificate of public convenience and necessity from the Commission
6 before beginning operation or construction of any line, plant or system or any
7 extension thereof. (NRS 704.330) Section 2 of this bill provides that a person is not
8 a public utility that is required to be regulated by the Commission if the person: (1)
9 is engaged in the business of furnishing a telecommunication service for
10 compensation; (2) serves 25 persons or less; and (3) earned $50,000 or less from
11 the gross sales of intrastate telecommunications services during the immediately
12 preceding 12 months. Sections 6 and 19 of this bill make conforming changes to
13 reflect the renumbering of certain subsections by section 2.

– 2 –
14 Section 1 of this bill requires the Commission to annually review each person
15 who holds a certificate of public convenience and necessity to provide
16 telecommunication service to determine whether the person continues to operate as
17 a public utility in this State. Section 1 requires the Commission to revoke a
18 certificate of public convenience and necessity granted to such a person if, after a
19 reasonable investigation and hearing, the Commission determines that the person:
20 (1) no longer owns, controls, maintains or operates as a public utility; (2) the person
21 does not plan to start, continue or resume operating as a public utility in this State
22 by a definite date; and (3) the person has no definite plan to own, control or operate
23 a public utility that is otherwise required to obtain a certificate of public
24 convenience and necessity. Sections 4 and 5 of this bill require the Commission to
25 conduct hearings and issue orders under section 1 in the same manner as the
26 Commission conducts hearings and issues orders for other matters relating to
27 certificates of public convenience and necessity.
28 Existing law authorizes a board of county commissioners to grant certain public
29 utilities the franchise, right and privilege to construct, install, operate and maintain
30 lines, mains and other utility equipment in any unincorporated town in the county
31 and along the public roads and highways of the county. (NRS 709.050) Existing
32 law also authorizes a local government to: (1) manage the use of any public right-
33 of-way or highway by video service providers; and (2) require a video service
34 provider to pay a franchise fee for the privilege of providing video service through
35 a network that occupies or uses any public right-of-way or highway within the
36 jurisdiction of the local government. (NRS 711.640, 711.670) Section 14 of this
37 bill authorizes a local government to adopt an ordinance to grant a broadband
38 service provider or broadband infrastructure provider the franchise, right and
39 privilege to construct, install, operate and maintain broadband equipment and
40 broadband service lines in the public right-of-way and along the highways in the
41 jurisdiction of the local government. Section 14 requires a broadband service
42 provider or broadband infrastructure provider to obtain a franchise from a local
43 government that has adopted such an ordinance before constructing or installing
44 any broadband equipment or broadband service lines within the jurisdiction of the
45 local government. If a local government has not adopted an ordinance, section 14
46 requires a broadband service provider or broadband infrastructure provider to enter
47 into an agreement with the local government concerning the use and occupation of
48 the public right-of-way or highway. Section 15 of this bill: (1) prescribes the
49 requirements of such an ordinance, agreement or franchise; and (2) authorizes a
50 local government to impose a fee against a broadband service provider or
51 broadband infrastructure provider for the privilege of using and occupying the
52 public right-of-way or highway of the local government. Section 16 of this bill
53 requires that such a fee: (1) be assessed equally and uniformly; and (2) reflect a
54 reasonable charge for the use and occupation of the public right-of-way or highway,
55 which may not exceed 5 percent of the gross revenue of the broadband service
56 provider or broadband infrastructure provider earned by providing services within
57 the jurisdiction of the local government. Section 17 of this bill authorizes a local
58 government to take certain regulatory actions with respect to its management of the
59 use and occupation of its public right-of-way or highway by broadband service
60 providers and broadband infrastructure providers. Section 18 of this bill excludes a
61 fee imposed by a local government pursuant to section 16 from certain prohibitions
62 on the ability of a local government to adopt or increase certain other fees for
63 business licenses.
64 Sections 10 and 12 of this bill exclude persons who are regulated by the
65 Commission as public utilities and persons who are authorized to construct and
66 operate a video service network from the definition of broadband infrastructure
67 provider and broadband service provider, respectively. Sections 9, 11 and 13 of
68 this bill define certain other terms, and section 8 of this bill establishes the
-
*AB509*

– 3 –
69 applicability of those definitions to the provisions of sections 8-17. Section 3 of
70 this bill establishes the applicability of the existing definition of “electric utility”
71 for purposes of section 1.

26 government will not collect in the next subsequent fiscal year,
27  is the base from which the maximum allowable revenue from
28 such fees must be calculated for the next subsequent fiscal year. To
29 the base must be added the sum of the amounts respectively equal to
30 the product of the base multiplied by the percentage increase in the
31 population of the local government added to the percentage increase
32 in the Consumer Price Index for the year ending on December 31
33 next preceding the year for which the limit is being calculated. The
34 amount so determined becomes the base for computing the allowed
35 increase for each subsequent year.
36 3. A local government may not increase any fee for a business
37 license which is calculated as a fraction or percentage of the gross
38 revenue of the business if its total revenues from such fees have
39 increased during the preceding fiscal year by more than the increase
40 in the Consumer Price Index during that preceding calendar year.
41 The provisions of this subsection do not apply to a fee:
42 (a) Imposed in compliance with the provisions of NRS 711.670
43 on video service providers for the privilege of doing business
44 pursuant to chapter 711 of NRS;

– 12 –
1 (b) Imposed pursuant to NRS 244.348, 268.0973, 268.821 or
2 269.182; or
3 (c) Regulated pursuant to NRS 354.59881 to 354.59889,
4 inclusive.
5 4. A local government may submit an application to increase
6 its revenue from fees for business licenses beyond the amount
7 allowable pursuant to this section to the Nevada Tax Commission,
8 which may grant the application only if it finds that the rate of a
9 business license of the local government is substantially below that
10 of other local governments in the State.
11 5. The provisions of this section apply to a business license
12 regardless of the fund to which the revenue from it is assigned. An
13 ordinance or resolution enacted by a local government in violation
14 of the provisions of this section is void.
15 6. As used in this section, “fee for a business license” does not
16 include a tax imposed on the revenues from the rental of transient
17 lodging.
18 Sec. 19. NRS 459A.010 is hereby amended to read as follows:
19 459A.010 As used in this chapter, “public utility” means any
20 person who furnishes electricity to other persons. The term includes
21 municipal utilities but does not include persons who furnish
22 electricity only in emergencies or persons described in subsection
23 [4] 5 of NRS 704.021.
24 Sec. 20. 1. This section becomes effective upon passage and
25 approval.
26 2. Sections 1 to 19, inclusive, of this act become effective:
27 (a) Upon passage and approval for the purpose of adopting any
28 regulations and performing any other preparatory administrative
29 tasks that are necessary to carry out the provisions of this act; and
30 (b) On January 1, 2026, for all other purposes.
